Introduction RNA viruses must carry out a major part of their life cycle in cells which use DNA as their genetic material and RNA as genetic messages. On entry, the viral RNA is faced with the problem of inserting itself into the cellular information flow pattern in order to communicate its own instructions to the synthesizing machinery. A possibility one might entertain centers on whether an RNA virus employs the DNA to RNA to protein pathway of information flow. This could occur either because the DNA of the host already contains a sequence homologous to the viral RNA (i.e., the "escaped genetic message" hypothesis), or that DNA sequences are generated subsequent to infection by reversal ?f the DNA dependent RNA synthesizing reaction. Either mechanism would predict homology between viral RNA and some segment of DNA derived from infected cells. It is clear that a decision on the existence or nonexistence of homology between viral RNA and the host DNA is a necessary prelude to further experiments designed to delineate the molecular life history of an RNA genome. To answer questions of this nature, Doi and Spiegelman ('62) employed the specific hybridization test (Hall and Spiegelman, '61) com bined with the subsequently developed use of RNAase to eliminate "noise." The sensitivity required had already been achieved in earlier experiments which identified the DNA complements of ribosomal RNA (Yankofsky and Spiegelman, '62a, b; '63) and s-RNA (Giacomoni and Spiegelman, '62; Goodman and Rich, '62). Under conditions where com plexes between 23S r-RNA and DNA were readily observed, nono were detected between the viral RNA and the infected host DNA. The negative outcome of the hybridization test implies that the DNA to RNA pathway is not employed. We must conclude that these RNA viruses have evolved a mechanism of generating RNA copies from RNA. We predict then the existence of an enzymatic mechanism involving an RNA dependent RNA Polymerase which we have named "replicase" for purposes of brevity and alliterative usefulness. * This investigation was supported by Public Health Service Research Grant No. CA-0I094 from the National Cancer Institute and Grant No. GB-4876 from the National Science Foundation. 221</page><page sequence="2">222 AMERICAN SCIENTIST . The Search for the MS-2 Replicase The search for a unique RNA dependent Polymerase is complicated by the presence of a variety of enzymes in cells which, in addition to the DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (transcriptase), can incorporate ribonucleotides either terminally or subterminally into pr?existent RNA chains. In addition, there are others (e.g., RNA Phosphorylase, poly adenylate synthetase, etc.) which can mediate extensive synthesis of polynucleotide chains. It is obvious that a claim for a new type of RNA Polymerase must be accompanied by evidence for RNA dependence and a demonstration that the enzyme possesses some unique characteristic which differentiates it in one or more of its properties from previously known enzymes with which it can be confused. In addition to these enzymological difficulties, we recognized a bio logical feature of the situation which influenced in at least one important detail the procedure we chose in the search for replicase. The point at issue may perhaps best be described in rather naive and admittedly somewhat anthropomorphic terms. Consider an RNA virus approaching a cell some 106 times its size and into which the virus is going to inject its only strand of genetic information. Even if the protein-coated ribosomal RNA molecules are ignored, the cell cytoplasm still contains approxi mately 10,000 free RNA molecules of various sorts. If the new "repli case" were indifferent and replicated any RNA it happened to meet, what chance would the single original strand injected have of multiplying? Admittedly, there are several ways out of this dilemma. One could, for example, segregate the new Polymerase molecule and the viral RNA in some sequestered corner where they would be isolated and undisturbed by the mass of cellular RNA components. However, we entertained the unique possibility that the virus is ingenious enough to design a Polym erase which would recognize its own genome and ignore all other RNA molecules. At the outset, of course, we did not know which solution had been adopted by the virus to solve this dilemma, or even if the dilemma were real. However, the possibility that it did exist, and that replicase selec tivity might be the chosen solution, required that its implications should not be ignored; for if true, its disregard would guarantee failure. In par ticular, this view meant that we could not afford the luxury of employing any conveniently available RNA in the search for replicase. It demanded the use of viral RNA in all steps of the purification. Further, one might perhaps push the selectivity property to its ulti mate pessimistic conclusion. If the cleverness of the replicase extends further, it might well be true that even a fragment of its own genome would not be recognized and accepted for replication. This added possi bility made it necessary to provide a guarantee that the RNA employed is not only homologous, but also intact. This in turn would introduce the</page><page sequence="3">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 223 complication that stages of purification preceding the removal of ribo nuclease might well yield ambiguous or indeed false clues even with in tact homologous RNA. Thus, one would have to "fly blind'' initially and depend on very brief assays to provide the guides for the direction of the subsequent steps. Despite all these potential obstacles, many of which were actually realized, our first success was achieved in 1963 (Haruna, Nozu, Ohtaka, and Spiegelman, '63). A procedure involving negative protamine fraction ation and column chromatography yielded what looked like the relevant enzyme for E. coli infected with the RNA bacteriophage, MS-2. Most important of all, the preparation exhibited a virtually complete depen dence on added RNA, permitting a test of the expectation of specific template requirement. The response of MS-2 replicase to various kinds of nucleic acid revealed a striking preference for its own RNA. No signif icant activity was observed with either the host s-RNA or ribosomal RNA. Our guess was apparently confirmed. By producing a polymerase which ignores the mass of pr?existent cellular RNA, a guarantee is pro vided that replication is focused on the single strand of incoming viral RNA, the ultimate origin of progeny. C. Confirmation of Specific Template Requirements of RNA Replicases Our line of reasoning would lead to the expectation that RNA repli case induced by other RNA viruses would show a similar preference for their homologous templates. This was, however, not a foregone conclu sion, since it was conceivable that other viruses might evolve different solutions to the problem of preferential synthesis. It seemed important to determine whether template selectivity could be observed in another virus unrelated to MS-2. The Q? phage of Watanabe ('64) was chosen be cause of its serological and other chemical differences (Overby, Barlow, Doi, Jacob, .and Spiegelman, '66a, b). The isolation and purification of the Q?-replicase (Haruna and Spiegel man, '65 a) followed, with slight modifications, the procedures worked out earlier for the MS-2 replicase. The general properties of the Q0-rep licase were similar to those observed with MS-2 replicase, including re quirements for all four triphosphates, and Mg++. The abilities of va rious RNA molecules to stimulate the Q?-replicase to synthetic activity at saturation concentrations of homologous RNA, are recorded in Table 1. The response of the Q?-replicase is in accord with that reported (Haruna, et al., '63) for the MS-2 replicase, the preference being clearly for its own template. The heterologous viral RNA's, MS-2 and STNV, are completely inactive, and so are the ribosomal and transfer RNA species of the host cell. It is important to note that, as in the case of MS-2 replicase, the absence of response to DNA shows that our purification</page><page sequence="4">224 AMERICAN SCIENTIST procedure eliminates detectable evidence of transcriptase from our en zyme preparations. D. Recognition of Template Intactness An obvious device to explain the requirement for a specific template would invoke the recognition of a beginning sequence, a possibility open to the simple test of challenging the replicase with fragmented prepa rations of homologous RNA. If the initial sequence is the sole require ment, RNA fragmented to half and quarter pieces should serve ade quately as templates. One would expect that the initial rate with frag ments would be the same as with intact templates, although the reaction table 1 response of q/3-replicase to different templates (Haruna and Spiegel man, *65a) As in all cases, assay for DNA dependent activity is carried out at 10 jug of DNA per 0.25 ml of reaction mixture. Input levels of template Q?-RNA were 1 /?g per 0.25 ml. Control reactions containing no template yielded an average of 30 cpm. Numbers represent counts per minute (cpm) incorporated as detailed in Figure 1. Template Incorporation Q0 4,929 TYMV 146 MS-2 35 Ribosomal RNA 45 s-RNA 15 Bulk RNA from infected cells 146 Satellite virus 61 DNA (10 Mg) 36 might terminate sooner. A different response would, however, be pre dicted if a secondary structure requiring intact molecules were involved in the recognition mechanism. It was found (Haruna and Spiegelman, '65b) that fragmented material is unable to stimulate the replicase to anywhere near its full activity no matter how much is added. Half pieces achieve approximately 10% the rate of the intact strand, and the rate attainable with the quarter pieces is only 2% of normal. Further, in both cases the reaction quickly ter minates. The inability of the replicase properly to employ fragments of its own genome as templates argues against a recognition mechanism involving only a beginning sequence. The enzyme can apparently sense when it is confronted with an intact RNA molecule implying that some element of secondary structure is involved. A plausible formal explanation can be proposed in terms of "functional circularity." Thus, a decision on the intactness of a linear heteropolymer can be readily made by examining both ends for the proper sequences. An examination of this sort would be</page><page sequence="5">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 225 physically aided by forming a circle using terminal sequences of over lapping complementarity. The enzyme could then recognize the resulting double stranded region. This particular model is offered only as an example of how an enzyme could simultaneously distinguish both sequence and intactness. Whatever the details turn out to be, it appears that the RNA replicases are designed to minimize the futility of replicating either for eign sequences or incomplete copies of their own genome. CPM 60 120 180 240 300 60 120 180 240 300 MINUTES MINUTES Fig. 1. Autocatalytic Synthesis of Viral RNA. A 2.5 ml reaction mixture contained 400 /tg of enzyme protein -and 2 % of input Q/3-RNA so that the starting ratio of template to enzyme was one-fifth of the saturating level. At the indicated times, 0.19 ml aliquots were removed and assayed for radioactive RNA. The ordinates for cpm and % of RNA synthesized refer to that found in 0.19 ml samples. The data are plotted against time arithmetically on the right, and semilogarithmically on the left. The arrows indicate change from autocatalyatic to linear kinetiqs. (Haruna and Spie gelman, '65.) E. Autocatalytic Synthesis of a Viral RNA The ability of a replicase to distinguish one RNA sequence from another can be used to provide information pertinent to the question of similarity between the synthesized product and the original viral RNA. Two sorts of readily performed experiments can decide whether the product is recognized by the enzyme as a template. One approach is to examine the kinetics of RNA synthesis at template concentrations which start below those required to saturate the enzyme. If the product can serve as a template, a period of autocatalytic increase of RNA should be</page><page sequence="6">226 AMERICAN SCIENTIST observed. Exponential kinetics should continue until the product satu rates the enzyme, after which synthesis should become linear. A second type of experiment is a direct test of the ability of the synthe sized product to function as initiating template. Here a synthesis of sufficient extent is carried out to insure that the initial input of RNA becomes a quantitatively minor component of the end product. The synthetic RNA can then be purified and examined for its template func tioning capacities, a property readily examined by means of a saturation curve. If the response of the enzyme to variation in concentration of product is the same as that observed with the authentic viral RNA, 4.0 o 3.0 cl o 2.0 h 1.0 h = SYNTHESIZED PRODUCT O = YIRAL RNA I 2 3.0 /?g RNA Fig. 2. Saturation of Enzyme by Synthesized RNA Compared to Viral RNA. The circles refer to the values obtained with RNA isolated from virus particles, the tri angles to the rates obtained with the RNA synthesized. Since, in the latter case, the template used was labeled with P32, HMJTP at 1 X 106 cpm per 0.2 mole was used to follow the synthesis. (Haruna and Spiegelman, '65c.) one would have to conclude that the product generated in the reaction is as effective a template for the replicase as is RNA of a mature par ticle. An experiment was therefore performed (Haruna and Spiegelman, '65c) in which the ratio of input template to protein was % of the satura tion value. The results are plotted in Figure 1 arithmetically and semi logarithmically against time to permit ready comparison of kinetics. Exponential increase of RNA is evident over a period of approximately three hours. The arrows indicate the time at which the kinetics depart from exponential and become linear. Extrapolation to the ordinate in dicates that the change to linear synthesis occurs when approximately</page><page sequence="7">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 227 one /xg of RNA has accumulated. The autocatalytic synthesis below saturation has been confirmed with the implication that the product produced in the course of the reaction can serve to stimulate new enzyme molecules to activity. The enzyme is therefore able to recognize the product as being one which is homologous to its own genome. To carry out the more direct test of this conclusion, a one ml reaction mixture was set up and the synthesis allowed to proceed for 3.5 hours, by which time a more than 60-fold increase of the input material was achieved. The reaction was then terminated and the RNA purified by the phenol method which yielded 55% of the synthesized product. Exami nation in a sucrose gradient showed that a majority of the product has the 28S size characteristic of Q?-RNA. Figure 2 illustrates the response of the replicase to various input levels of the product (triangles) compared to the original viral RNA (circles). It is evident that the RNA synthesized is as effective in serving as a template as the original viral RNA. The data just summarized support the assertion that the reaction generates a polynucleotide of the same molecular weight (1 X 106) as viral RNA and which the replicase cannot distinguish from its homol ogous genome. Evidently, the enzyme is faithfully copying the recog nition sequences employed by the replicase to distinguish one RNA mol ecule from another. F. Evidence for the Synthesis of an Infectious Self-Replicating Viral RNA The next question concerns the extent of the similarity between prod uct and template. Have identical duplicates been in fact produced? The most decisive test would determine whether the product contains all the information required to program the synthesis of complete virus particles in a suitable test system. The success we have just recorded encouraged an attempt at the next phase of the investigation which would subject the synthesized RNA to this more rigorous challenge (Spiegelman, Haruna, Holland, Beaudreau, and Mills, '65). As a first approach, the appearance of newly synthesized RNA was compared with the number of infectious units in an extensive synthesis. Aliquots were taken from a reaction mixture at the times indicated for the determination of radioactive RNA and phenol purification of the product for infectivity assay. Figure 3 shows the observed increase in both RNA and infectious units. The amount of RNA added is well below the saturation level of the enzyme present. Consequently, the RNA in creases autocatalytically for about the first 90 minutes followed by a synthesis which is linear with time. We note that the increase in RNA is paralleled by a rise in the number of infectious units. The kind of experiment just described offers plausible evidence for infectivity of the newly synthesized radioactive RNA. It is not, however,</page><page sequence="8">228 AMERICAN SCIENTIST conclusive, since the possibility is not eliminated that the agreement ob served is fortuitous. One couJd argue, however implausibly, that the enzyme is "activating'1 the input RNA to higher levels of infectivity while synthesizing new noninfectious RNA; the concordance of a rather complex combination of exponential and linear kinetics of the tw? pro cesses would then be fortuitous. I _ _ _ -1 60 120 180 240 MINUTES Fig. 3. Kinetics of RNA Synthesis and Formation of Infectious Units. An 8 ml reac tion mixture was set up and samples were taken as follows: 1 ml at 0 time and 30 min., 0.5 ml at 60 min., 0.3 ml at 90 min., and 0.2 ml at all subsequent times. 20 were removed for assay of incorporated radioactivity. The RNA was purified from the remainder, radioactivity being determined on the final product to monitor recovery. (Spiegelman, et al., '65.) To answer the issues raised by such arguments one can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with a presumed self-propagating entity. Consider a series of tubes each containing 0.25 ml of the standard reac tion mixture, but no added template. The first tube is seeded with 0.2 g of Q?-RNA and incubated for a period adequate for the synthesis of sev</page><page sequence="9">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 229 eral /zg of radioactive RNA. An aliquot is then transferred to the second tube, which is in turn permitted to synthesize about the same amount of RNA, a portion of which is again transferred to a third tube, and so on. If each successive synthesis produces RNA which can serve to initiate transfers Fig. 4. RNA Synthesis and Formation of Infectious Units in a Serial Transfer Experiment. Sixteen reaction mixtures of 0.25 ml were set up, each containing 40 y of protein and the other components specified for the "standard" assay. 0.2 y of template RNA were added to tubes 0 and 1 ; RNA was extracted from the former immediately, and the latter was allowed to incubate for 40 minutes. Then 50 of tube 1 were transferred to tube 3 and so on, each step after the first involving a 1 to 6 dilution of the input material. Every tube was transferred from an ice bath to the 35?C water bath a few minutes before use to permit temperature equilibration. After the transfer from a given tube, 20 were removed to determine the amount of P32-RNA synthesized, and the product purified from the remainder. Control tubes incubated for 60 minutes without the addition of the 0.2 y of RNA showed no detect able RNA synthesis, nor any increase in the number of infectious units. All recorded numbers are normalized to 0.25 ml. The ordinates represent cumulative increases of infectious units and radioactive RNA in each transfer. The abscissa records elapsed time and the transfer number. (Spiegelman et al., '65. ) the next one, the experiment can be continued indefinitely, and in par ticular until the point is reached at which the initial RNA of tube I has been diluted to an insignificant level. In fact, enough transfers can be made to insure that the last tube contains less than one strand of the in put primer. I*/, in all the tubes including the last one, the number of infectious units corresponds to the amount of radioactive RNA found, convincing evi dence is offered that the newly synthesized RNA is infectious. A complete account of such a serial transfer experiment will be found in Spiegelman, et al. ('65), and Figure 4 describes the outcome. Aside from</page><page sequence="10">230 AMERICAN SCIENTIST controls, 15 transfers were involved, each resulting in a 1 to 6 dilution. By the eighth tube, there was less than one infectious unit ascribable to the initiating RNA and the 15th tube contained less than one strand of the initial input. Nevertheless, every tube showed an increment in in fectious units corresponding to the radioactive RNA found. FRACTION NUMBER Fig. 5. Behavior of Enzyme Preparations during CsCl Centrifugation. 1 ml of 10% ammonium sulfate in standard buffer (0.01 M tris, pH 7.4; 0.005 M MgCl2; 0.0005 M 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 10-15 mg of post-DEAE enzyme protein was layered over 4 ml of CsCl solution adjusted to a density of 1.40 gm/cm3. The tube was centrifuged at 0? for 24 hours in the Spinco SW-39 rotor at 39,000 rpm. After centrifugation, the tube was pierced through the side, immediately below the visible protein band, and fractions were collected through a 20 gauge hypodermic needle. The needle was bent in a right angle to permit insertion with the long arm up, follow ing which the latter is rotated through 180? to permit the contents to emerge. The lower portion of the tube was then removed by piercing the bottom and collecting fractions. In this manner, contamination of the protein band (p = 1.40) was mini mized. Fractions were then diluted to 1 ml with 10% ammonium sulfate in standard buffer for optical density measurements and enzyme assays. (Pace and Spiegelman, '66a. ) (r. Further Purification of Replicase According to Its Size and Density The experiments just summarized established that activation of the input template cannot be invoked to explain the results observed in the serial transfer experiment. They did not, however, eliminate arguments which involved "activation" of RNA contaminating the enzyme prepara tion by an unknown reaction which requires both added template and new RNA synthesis. It seemed desirable to eliminate this possibility by</page><page sequence="11">231 AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE further purification of the enzyme with procedures which would com pletely remove nucleic acid contaminants. .150 A -1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1? 5 10 15 20 25 FRACTION NUMBER FRACTION NUMBER Fig. 6. Sedimentation through Sucrose Gradients. The peak tubes from the enzyme regions of CsCl gradients were pooled and precipitated from 50 per cent saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dispersed in standard buffer to a protein concentration of 25-30 mg/ml and the suspension dialyzed for 2 hours against 250 ml standard buffer at 0?. Between 0.2 and 0.3 ml of the dialyzed protein solution was layered onto a 5.4 ml 5% to 20% linear gradient of sucrose dissolved in standard buf fer. When a reference protein was desired, 100 7 of catalase was included in each 0.2 ml of protein solution. Gradients were centrifuged at 0? for 12-15 hours at 39,000 rpm in the Spinco SW-39 rotor. Again, to avoid contamination with pelleted virus particles and other material, the enzyme region was collected from the side as de scribed for CsCl centrifugation. (Pace and Spiegelman, ?66a.) An obvious approach to the separation of virus particles from replicase would take advantage (Pace and Spiegelman, '66a) of expected dispari ties in size and density. The Q? virus has a molecular weight of 4.2 X 106</page><page sequence="12">232 AMERICAN SCIENTIST and a density of 1.43 gm/cm3 (Overby, et al, '66a, b). It was unlikely that the replicase would be as large or as dense. 1. Pycnographic purification: The results of banding enzyme protein in a CsCl gradient are presented in Figure 5. Virus particles are found at a Fig. 7. Synthesis of RNA and Infectious Units by Purified Enzyme. Eleven reaction mixtures of 0.125 ml, each containing 22 /xg of enzyme purified through CsCl and su crose centrifugation and the other components of the standard reaction mixture were prepared. Specific activity of P32 UTP was such that 8,000 cpm signified 1 Mg RNA product. To the first tube was added 0.1 g Q?-RNA, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 25 minutes at 35?, whereupon 0.02 ml were withdrawn for counting and 0.01 ml used as template for the second reaction. The first tube was then frozen and stored at ?70?. The second reaction product was used to initiate the third and so on. A second series of transfers was carried out in a manner identical to that described, save that no initial RNA template was added to the first reaction mixture. Aliquota of all the reaction mixtures were assayed directly for infectious units. In the case of the control transfer series, samples were diluted 1/10 and then mixed with proto plasts.

Employing catalase (molecular weight, 2.5 X 105) as a standard, the molecular weight of replicase may be estimated at 1.1 X 105. It should be noted that the final residue of phage contamination is such that only 1 to 10 plaque-forming units are introduced into a standard re action mixture, a level which would not be detected by our usual sam pling procedure. 3.

The left hand ordinate gives the P32 cpm in TCA precipitable product in each 0.25 ml. The right hand ordinate gives the number of infectious units per 0.25 ml observed in the spheroplast assay. (Mills, Pace, and Spiegelman, '66.) CsCl and sucrose purification steps could produce infectious RNA, and this was done by a serial transfer experiment (Fig. 7). Since the reaction in the first tube was started with 6 X 1010 (0.1 Mg) of Q0-RNA and each involves a K2.5 dilution, the contribution of the initiating RNA to the infectious centers measured in the fourth tube would be below the level of detectability, and this tube contained 24 X 10b infectious units. Finally, the eleventh reaction contains less than one strand of the initial primer and at the same time showed 2.5 X 105 infectious units as determined by</page><page sequence="15">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A* REPLICATING MOLECULE 235 plaques formed in the protoplast assay. Clearly, the replicase purified by pycnography and sedimentation has retained its ability to produce bio logically competent copies. There remains the task of a rigorous demonstration that th? added RNA and not the replicase is the instructive agent in the replicative pro cess. H. A Rigorous Proof that the Added RNA is the Self-duplicating Entity The central issue we now consider stems from the fact that two in formed components are present in the reaction mixture, replicase and RNA template. None of the experiments thus far described proved that the RNA synthesized in this system is, in fact, a self-duplicating entity, i.e., one which contains the requisite information and directs its own synthesis. What is required is a rigorous demonstration that the RNA, and not the replicase, is the instructive agent in the replicative process. A definitive decision would be provided by an experimental answer to the following question: If the replicase is provided alternately with two dis tinguishable RNA molecules, is the product produced always identical to the initiating template? A positive outcome would establish that the RNA is directing its own synthesis and simultaneously completely elimi nate any remaining possibility of "activation" of preexisting RNA. Ex periments to settle these issues were undertaken by Pace and Spiegelman ('66b). The discriminating selectivity of the replicase for its own genome as template makes it impossible to employ heterologous RNA in the test ex periments and, therefore, recourse was had to mutants. For ease in isola tion and simplicity in distinguishing between mutant and wild type, tem perature sensitive (ts) mutants were chosen. Their diagnostic phenotype is poor growth at 41 ?C as compared with 34? C. The wild type grows equally well at both temperatures. We should be able to determine whether the product produced by a normal replicase primed with ts-Q/3-RNA is mutant or wild type. As in previous investigations, this is best done by a serial transfer experiment to avoid the ambiguity of examining reactions containing significant quantities of the initiating RNA. Accordingly, seven standard reaction mixtures (0.25 ml) were pre pared, each containing 60 ^g of Q?-replicase isolated from cells infected with normal virus. To the first reaction mixture was added 0.2 g of RNA and synthesis allowed to proceed at 35?. After a suitable interval, Vio of this reaction mixture was used to initiate a second reaction which, in turn, was diluted into a third reaction mixture, and so on for seven trans fers. A control series was carried out in a manner identical to that just described, save that no RNA was added to the first tube. Aliquots from each reaction were examined for radioactivity in TCA-precipitable mate</page><page sequence="16">236 AMERICAN SCIENTIST rial and assayed for infectious RNA at 34? and 41 ?. Figure 8 summarizes the outcome of the experiment in a cumulative plot of the RNA synthesized and the plaque formers at the two test tem peratures of 34?C and 41 ?C. It is clear that the RNA synthesized has the ts-phenotype; while plaque formation at 34?C increases in parallel with the new RNA synthesized, no such increase is seen when the tests are carried out at 41?C. It should be noted from the upper panel of Figure 8 that no significant synthesis of either RNA or infectious units was ob served in the control series of tubes to which initiating templates were not added. CPM (H3-TEMPLATE) 15 SECONDS 5 10 15 20 TUBE NUMBER Fig. 10. Sedimentation Analysis of the Fifteen Second Sample. 0.20 ml of a sixty fold dilution of the 15 second sample after digestion with pronase and SDS was sub mitted to sedimentation in sucrose as described in the text. All H3 cpm were ad justed to be equivalent to examining 0.05 ml of the reaction. No acid precipitable P32-cpm were observed. (Mills, Pace, and Spiegelman, '66.) The experiments just described demonstrate that one and the same normal replicase can produce distinguishably different but genetically re lated RNA molecules. The genetic type produced is completely deter mined by the RNA used to start the reaction and is always identical to it. The following two conclusions would appear to be inescapable from these findings: (1) The RNA is the instructive agent in the replicating pro cess and therefore satisfies the operational definition of a self-duplicating entity; (2) It is not some cryptic contaminant of the enzyme, but rather the input RNA which multiplies.</page><page sequence="17">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 237 CPM (H-TEMPLATE; P3-PRODUCT) 2 MINUTES RNAase RESISTANCE ?. o S* a.

An Analysis of the Mechanism of RNA Replication with the Purified Enzyme It is evident that the properties of the enzyme system had been brought to a stage which encouraged an attempt at an analysis of the mechanism of the synthesis. Since the reaction starts with viral RNA (plus strands) and ends with more of the same, every necessary interven ing stage must be represented in the reaction mixture. A search was made (Haruna and Spiegelman, '66) during the early events of synthesis for evidences of intermediate forms involving complements (minus strands), a possibility implied by experiments with mutants (Lodish and Zinder, '66), and suggested by the presence of structures partially resistant to ribonuclease first observed with an animal virus (Montagnier and San ders, '63) and also seen in cells infected with RNA bacteriophages (Am manii, Delius, and Hofschneider, '64; Weissmann, Borst, Burdon, Bilie ter, and Ochoa, '64; Kelly and Sinsheimer, '64; Nonoyama and Ikeda, '64; Fenwick, Erikson, and Franklin, '64). The presence of complements in the Q? replicase reaction was ex amined for by annealing experiments to plus strands. Advantage was also taken of the base composition of Q?-RNA in which A is not equal to U, making it possible to detect minus strands in terms of complementary A to U ratios of the early product. The base composition showed no tend ency to linger at the complementary A/U value. Further, the extent of annealability to plus strands could be as readily explained in terms of partial copies of a template possessing some degree of self-complementar ity. The data forced us to the conclusion that we could not provide un ambiguous support for the intervention of a duplex composed of a plus strand and its complement. However, we recognized such negative evidence cannot logically elim inate complementary copying mechanisms. More or less obvious compli cations could prevent precise interpretations of the data. Thus, only a minor fraction of the input templates might have been involved in the re action. Further, the phenol method usually used to prepare samples rarely yields complete recovery and could introduce artifacts or selec tively eliminate components of interest. Finally, base compositions and annealabilities of early products would not readily detect complementary copying involving transient complements. Similarly, they might not re veal complement-sparing mechanisms in which a slow synthesis of a nega tive is accompanied by the immediate initiation of several positive strands. We decided to invert our approach to the problem and focus attention on the early fate of the initiating templates. The pycnographic and su crose density purification (Pace and Spiegelman, '66a) of the replicase made it possible to do direct infectivity assays of the reaction mixture,</page><page sequence="19">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 239 CPM (H3-TEMPLATE; P3-PRODUCT) 4 MINUTES 16* 14* 12 o? 10 o ? 4 X 2 H3 TEMPLATE P32 PRODUCT 10 15 TUBE NUMBER 20 INFECTIOUS UNITS WITH HEATING WITHOUT HEATING 10 15 TUBE NUMBER RNA ase RESISTANCE a. o 4 gl ?.

HMabeled Franklin structure RNA (Q0-FS, 7 X 103 cpm, 0.1 Mg) and P32-labeled Hofschneider structure RNA (Q/3-HS, 1.4 X IO3 cpm, 0.005 Mg) were mixed with P32-labeled Q? viral RNA (7 X IO2 cpm, 0.001 Mg) and subjected to electrophoresis on a Polyacrylamide gel (0.7 cm diameter) for 90 min. under standard conditions. The gels were sliced, dried, and counted. The apparent low recovery of H3 is due to quenching by the gel slice. (Bishop, Claybrook, Pace, and Spiegelman, '67.) some of these complexes should be non-infectious and release infectious plus strands on heat denaturation as reported by Hofschneider and his colleagues (Ammann, et al, '64; Francke and Hofschneider, '66a, b). Finally, the formation of these complexes should be accompanied by a disappearance of the input template as infectious entities. The relevant experiments along these lines are summarized.</page><page sequence="22">242 FS AMERICAN SCIENTIST HS Q? SMW DISTANCE (CM.) Fig. 15. Gel electrophoresis of reaction products.

Each slice was allowed to shake overnight in 10% TCA to remove acid soluble radio activity, then filtered on cellulose nitrate membranes, dried, and counted. (Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67a. ) 1. Kinetics of appearance of RNA and infectious units: The possibility of performing direct assays for infectious RNA permits a detailed com parison of the appearance of mature plus strands with the amounts of RNA synthesized. To distinguish between initiating template and prod uct, the former was labeled with H3 and the latter with P32. To max imize the detection of a complex involving template, the experiment was</page><page sequence="23">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 243 performed at low levels of initiating RNA. Conversion of templates into Hofschneider structures (HS) should re sult in their disappearance as plaque forming units (pfu). Thus, if the time required to complete the first plus strands is significant in the time scale of the experiment, one should observe a latent period accompanied by an apparent eclipse of measurable infectious RNA. MINUTES Fig. 16. Synthesis of RNA and Infectious Units. A ten-fold (2.50 ml) standard re action as detailed in reference was carried out at 38? with H3-labeled template and P32 incorporation signifying product. From the reaction, aliquots were withdrawn at intervals for examination of acid insoluble radioactivity (RNA product) and in fectious units. (Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67b. ) Figure 9 describes data which show that these expectations are real ized. It is evident that a considerable loss (^75%) of pfu is observed by the fourth minute of synthesis, providing clear evidence of the eclipse and latent periods. Both end at about six minutes which appears to corre spond to the time required to complete the first new mature strands.</page><page sequence="24">244 AMERICAN SCIENTIST 2. Sucrose gradient analysis of the reaction: If the disappearance of pfu is associated with the formation of HS, a peak containing H3-template and P32-product should appear in the 15S region of a sucrose gradient. Since, with time, the loss of pfu is extensive, the shift of H3 to the 15S region should be considerable by 2 minutes but negligible at 15 seconds.

Accordingly, aliquots of the samples taken in the experiment of Figure 9 at 15 seconds, 2, 4, and 6 minutes were subjected to analysis in sucrose gradients. The 15 second sample (Fig. 10) shows that virtually all of the H3 tem plate still is found in the 28S position with little evidence of distortion. The number of pfu found at 15 seconds agrees with the initial input of</page><page sequence="25">AN IN VITEO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 245 RNA and the amount of P32 incorporated is negligible. The two minute sample (Fig. 11) shows a dramatically different picture. A rather large proportion (62%) of the IP-template has been shifted from the 28S to the 15S region, a movement which is accompanied by the appearance of P32 product which is virtually confined to the 15S region. Assays for infec tious RNA without prior heating yield pfu only in the region of mature plus strands (28S). However, heat denaturation uncovers a large peak of activatable pfu at 15S. Finally, it is evident that both the tritiated tem plate and the P32-product in the 15S region show resistance (about 50%) to ribonuclease. This resistance disappears completely when the samples are heated for two minutes at 100?C in 0.003 M EDTA. The 4 minute sample (Fig. 12) shows the presence of product (P32 RNA) which is almost 28S. Again, we see the presence of both tritiated template and P32-product in the 15S region and a corresponding peak of heat activatable plaque forming units. Further, there is clear evidence again of resistance to ribonuclease of both template and product. The 6 minute sample (Fig. 13) shows the same general pattern, the only differ ence being that some 28S-P32 product has clearly been produced. J. The Use of Electrophoretic Separation on Acrylamide Gels for the An alysis of the Replicase Reaction It became apparent as our investigations progressed that centrifugal analysis in sucrose gradients did not possess the resolving power neces sary to identify all the components of the replicase reaction and unravel the temporal relations obtaining among them. It was particularly difficult to separate the Q?-HS from the structure (FS) identified by Franklin 066) in cells infected with R-17. We turned our attention, therefore, to the use of electrophoretic sepa ration on acrylamide gels (Loening, '67) and found (Bishop, Claybrook, and Spiegelman, '67) that this procedure permitted excellent separation of viral nucleic acids with complete retention of biological activity. Com parison revealed evident advantages over the sucrose gradient procedure (Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67). To examine the behavior of HS and FS structures on gels, H3-Q?-FS and P32-Q?-HS were prepared from E. coli Q-13 infected with Q? according to the procedures of Franklin ('66) and Francke and Hofschneider ('66), respectively. Mixtures of H3-Q?-FS, P32-Q?-HS, and P32-Q?-RNA were subjected to 90 minute electrophoresis, using 0.7 cm diameter gels under standard conditions. It is apparent from Figure 14 that Q?-HS and Q? FS separate from each other as well as from Q?-RNA. There is no evi dence of any tendency for the Q?-RNA to aggregate with either one of these complex structures. Q?-HS has a relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) approximately 40% that of Q?-RNA, while the REM of Q?-FS</page><page sequence="26">246 AMERICAN SCIENTIST is 15% that of Q?-RNA. We have found that the distances traversed by Q?-FS, Q?-HS, and Q?-RNA in bis-acrylamide cross-linked 2.4% gels are proportional to the time of electrophoresis.

At the termination of the experiment, an amount of bio logically active RNA has been synthesized corresponding to 17 times th? starting material. An aliquot of each sample of Figure 16 was submitted to electrophore sis through acrylamide gels with results shown in Figures 17-20. The gels are defined on the basis of our earlier investigations (Bishop, Claybrook, Pace, and Spiegelman, '&amp;7) into regions which contain the Franklin structures (FS), Hof Schneider structures (HS), mature 28S viral RNA, (Q0) and small molecular weight (SMW) fragments. It should be noted INVOLVEMENT OF INPUT STRAND Q0-FS 10 TIME (MIN.) 15 20 Fig. 21. Kinetic Behavior of Input Template.

(Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67b.) that, although the entire gel is cut and counted in every case, to conserve space, not all of the SMW regions are shown.

By 0'40" (Fig. 17) a significant portion (14%) of input template has moved into the HS region.

In the next three 20* samples (Figs. 18A, B, and C) FS and HS complexes, containing both template and new prod uct, continue to build up without any evidence of mature viral RNA.

The inset magnifies the first 4 minutes of the reaction course. (Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67b. ) and clear evidence is seen 20 seconds later (Fig. 19). In the subsequent samples examined (Figs. 19-20) the 28S variety accumulates rapidly. To provide an overall picture of the flow pattern among components, P32 and H3 radioactivities were summed in each of the defined regions of the gel for every sample. We first focus attention on the fate of the H3 labeled initiating templates (Fig. 21). The summed H3 counts of each re</page><page sequence="31">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 251 gion are expressed as a fraction of the total H3 counts in the correspond ing gel and plotted in Fig. 21 as a function of time. In agreement with our other findings (Bishop, Claybrook, Pace, and Spiegelman, '67), it is evi dent that templates appear first in the HS structures and this is followed by their involvement in FS complexes. We again observe a drop in the HS at about 2 minutes just as the FS structures begin to make their ap pearance. We now turn our attention to the behavior of the product and its dis tribution among HS, FS, and Q?-RNA as a function of time. Figure 22 Fig. 23. Relative Quantities of Product in the Reaction. The data from Fig. 22 for each species are considered as a per cent of the total P32-product recovered from respective gels. (Pace, Bishop, and Spiegelman, '67b.) graphically summarizes the net accumulation of P32-product in the var ious components as the replicase reaction proceeds. The inset to Figure 22 magnifies by ordinate expansion the results obtained with samples taken in the first four minutes of the synthesis, the interval of greatest interest. As is apparent, the earliest detectable P32-product is found in the HS region, clear evidence of accumulation being observed at one min ute and before any signs of entry of product into the FS complexes. It will be noted (inset of Fig. 22) that as FS synthesis becomes appreciable, the formation of HS is temporarily diminished. Similarly, the onset of Q?</page><page sequence="32">252 AMERICAN SCIENTIST RNA synthesis at about 2.5 minutes is accompanied by a temporary diminution in the rate of accumulation of FS. Figure 23 expresses the data of Figures 17-20 as relative quantities of each species at each point of time. Included are the small molecular weight regions of the gel in order to illustrate their relation to the other components. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 55 74 TRANSFERS Fig. 24. Serial Transfer Experiment. Each 0.25 ml standard reaction mixture con tained 40 ?g of QjS replicase purified through CsCl and sucrose centrifugation, and P3MJTP at a specific activity such that 4,000 cpm correspond to 1 #g of synthesized RNA. The first reaction (0 transfer) was initiated by the addition of 0.2 ^g ts-1 RNA (temperature sensitive RNA) and incubated at 35?C for 20', whereupon 0.02 ml was withdrawn for counting and 0.02 ml was used to prime the second reaction (1st transfer) and so on. After the first 13 reactions, the incubation periods were re duced to 15 minutes (transfers 14-29). Transfers 30-38 were incubated for 10 minutes. Transfers 39-52 were incubated for 7 minutes, and Transfers 53-74 were incubated for 5 minutes. The arrows above transfers (0, 8, 14, 29, 37, 53, and 73) indicate where 0.01-0.1 of product was removed and used to prime reactions for sedimentation an alysis on sucrose (see Figs. 25-29). The inset examines both infectious and total RNA. The results show that biologically competent RNA ceases to appear after the 4th transfer. (Mills, Peterson, and Spiegelman, '67. ) The HS structures containing product appear first and increase to a maximum at about 2 minutes. As the HS decrease, the Q?-FS appear and reach their maximal proportion at a little over two minutes, soon after which 28S Q?-RNA is synthesized. It should be noted that the RNA in</page><page sequence="33">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 253 the SMW regions begins to increase simultaneously with the production of mature RNA molecules. The fragments do not therefore play a role in the events occurring in the latent periods. The fact that fragmentation of intact H3-28S of the input templates does not occur suggests that, the ac cumulation of the P32 fragments is due primarily to aborted syntheses rather than nucleolytic degradation. In evaluating the significance of the experiments just summarized, it is important to note that all samples were analyzed directly aft?r treat ment with SDS. There was no prior fractionation by procedures which let TRANSFER FRACTION Fig. 25. Sedimentation Analysis of the 1st Transfer Reaction. 0.02 ml of the 0 re action was used to initiate a reaction for a 1st transfer reaction product. After com pletion, this reaction was adjusted to 0.2% SDS, an aliquot was withdrawn, diluted to 0.2 ml in TE buffer (0.01 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.003 M EDTA), and then layered onto a 5 ml linear sucrose (2-20% in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4 and 0.003 M EDTA) and centri fuged. HMabeled bulk RNA of E. coli was included as internal size markers. (Mills, Peterson, and Spiegelman, '67.) can lead to selective loss or enrichment of particular components. The full spectrum of heterogeneity of the HS and FS complexes is repre sented as is evident from the marked polydispersity seen in the earlier phases of the synthesis (Figs. 2C-3D). This is not unexpected since the HS and FS structures are classes of heterogeneous complexes caught at various stages of completion. The data described provide precise information relevant to an under standing of the replicative process. It is clear that the sequence of events which emerges is the same whether attention is focused on template in volvement or product synthesized. The most revealing events occur in</page><page sequence="34">254 AMERICAN SCIENTIST the eclipse and latent periods (Fig. 16) and the salient features may be summarized as follows: (a) Initiating templates leave the 28S region and appear first as noninfectious complexes in the HS region; (6) All of the first product synthesized appears initially as material complexed to H3 FRACTION templates in the HS region; (c) After the HS structures are formed, com plexes containing both template and product appear in the FS region of the gel; (d) The emergence of the HS and FS structures is paralleled by a</page><page sequence="35">concomitant loss of the input RNA as infectious entities; (?) New 28S Q?-RNA is synthesized after the FS structures have appeared. The temporal order of their appearance and the fact that the complexes contain both initiating template and newly synthesized product are consistent with a mechanism of synthesis which involves the following sequence of steps template HS FS Q?-RNA</page><page sequence="36">256 AMERICAN SCIENTIST It is generally held (Ammann et ah, '64, Fen wick et ah, '64, Weissman et al, '64) that the conversion of initial template (plus strand) to HS requires the synthesis of a complementary (negative) strand to form a hydrogen-bonded double-stranded duplex. The latter is then used to generate new plus strands and in the process the HS structures are con verted to the multistranded FS structures. This generally accepted model makes certain predictions concerning the detailed chemistry of the HS and FS structures and their behavior in "pulse-chase" labeling experiments. Thus; the first strands synthesized should be complementary in base composition to the templates. Further, a nearest-neighbor analysis should enable one to decide whether the complement synthesized is parallel or anti-parallel to the templates. The ease with which the complexes can be synthesized in vitro with suitable labels on the two components and subsequently isolated on gels makes it possible to perform the necessary experiments. L. A Darwinian Experiment with the Replicating RNA Molecule We should like to conclude by a discussion of a novel approach made possible by the system we have developed. It was shown (Section H) that, when Q?-replicase is presented with two genetically distinct Q? RNA molecules, the RNA is identical to the initiating template. This specific response of the same enzyme preparation to the particular tem plate added proved that the RNA is the instructive agent in the replica tive process and hence satisfies the operational definition of a self-dupli cating entity. An opportunity is thus provided for studying the evolution of a self replicating nucleic acid molecule outside of a living cell. It should be noted that this situation mimics an early precellular evolutionary event, when environmental selection presumably operated directly on the genetic material. The comparative simplicity of the system and the ac cessibility of its known chemical components to manipulation permits the imposition of a variety of selection pressures during growth of the replicating molecules. We wish to report here one example (Mills, Peter son, and Spiegelman, '67) of the experiments thus made possible. In the universe provided to them in the test tube, the RNA molecules are liberated from many of the restrictions derived from the requirements of a complete viral life cycle. The only restraint imposed is that they re tain whatever sequences are involved in the recognition mechanism em ployed by the replicase. Thus, sequences which code for the coat proteins and replicase components may now be dispensable. Under these circum stances, it is of no little interest to design an experiment which attempts an answer to the following question: "What will happen to the RNA molecules if the only demand made on them is the Biblical injunction, multiply, with the biological proviso that they do so as rapidly as pos</page><page sequence="37">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 257 sible?" The conditions required are readily attained by a serial transfer experiment in which the intervals of synthesis between transfers are ad justed to select the first molecules completed. 54 th TRANSFER 10 20 FRACTION a. Selection during serial transfer: An account of a transfer experiment involving seventy-five serial reactions is illustrated in Fig. 24. The first reaction (Oth) was allowed to proceed 20 minutes at 35?C, whereupon a 20 aliquot was used to seed the second, and so on for the first thirteen</page><page sequence="38">258 AMERICAN SCIENTIST transfers. The incubation periods were then reduced as detailed in the legend of Figure 24. These periodic reductions in the incubation inter vals between transfers were instituted in an attempt to maintain the selection pressure for the most rapidly multiplying molecules. Three outstanding features of Figure 24 may be noted. As may be seen from the inset of Figure 24, the synthesis of biologically competent RNA ceased between the fourth and fifth transfers. Second, a dramatic in crease in the rate of incorporation of P32-UTP into RNA occurred be tween Transfers 8 and 9. Last, an apparent decrease in the rate of RNA synthesis, coinciding with the reduction in the incubation time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, occurred after Transfer 29. 10 20 30 40 DISTANCE MOVED, MM Fig. 29. Gel Electrophoresis of Hz CTP-Labeled 75th Transfer Reaction Product. A pre-swollen N,N'-methylene-&amp;ts-acrylamide cross-linked gel (2.4%) was used and samples for electrophoresis were about 0.1 ml and one mm sections were eluted in 0.5 ml. for 12 hr at 4?C with gentle shaking. All data are represented as cpm/.05 ml. (Mills, Peterson, and Spiegelman, '67.) The RNA products from the reactions indicated by arrows in Figure 24 were expanded by using them to initiate new replicase reactions which were continued for 40 min. at 35?C. The resulting products were then examined in sucrose gradients. The products obtained from the reaction initiated by the Oth transfer shows (Fig. 25) the 28S peak characteristic of Q0-RNA as well as the peaks corresponding to the usual complexes observed during the in vitro synthesis (Section I). Comparison with sub sequent transfers reveals, however, dramatic changes in the nature of the replicating entity. Thus, by the 9th transfer (Fig. 26) there is no material synthesized corresponding to the original 2?SL viral RNA. In its place we see a major component at about 20S and a minor one at about 15S. This pattern is essentially maintained through the 15th transfer (Fig. 26). By the 30th transfer (Fig. 27) the major component has decreased to</page><page sequence="39">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 259 15S and the minor one to about 14S. The product of the 38th transfer shows variant RNA which no longer splits into two peaks, a feature re tained through subsequent transfers. It will be noted (Fig. 28) however, that the single peak moves more slowly so that by the 75th transfer it is at about 12S. b. Gel electrophoresis of variant RNA: At this point it was decided to examine the nature of the variant in greater detail. Transfer 75 was expanded with replicase to a total of 120 ^g of RNA and subjected to analysis by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 29). Clearly, the apparently homogeneous peak of Figure 28 is composed of at least two distinct RNA species. As may be seen from Figure 29, the major com ponent is sensitive to ribonuclease whereas the minor one is resistant. It would appear that the faster component is the single-stranded variant and that the slower minor peak contains a mixture of the HS and FS structures. TABLE 2 BASE COMPOSITION OF VARIANT RNA (Mills, Peterson, and Spiegelman, '67) Variant RNA uniformly labeled with P32 was prepared, purified, and analyzed. The resulting data are given in the first line. To monitor the quantitative adequacy of the analysis, a parallel experiment was carried out with a similarly prepared and uni formly labeled 28S Q/3-RNA (second line, Q/3-RNA-1). The last line (Q0-RNA-2) gives, for comparison, the base composition of RNA isolated from virus particles (Overby, et al., '66a, b). Numbers represent mole per cent of the corresponding bases.

Molecular weight of variant RNA : To determine the molecular weight, the single-stranded variant RNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis with 6 internal marker RNA's of known size. The results indicate that the variant RNA has a molecular weight of about 1.7 X 105 daltons. d. Base composition of variant RNA: To determine its base composi tion, a standard reaction mixture was initiated with the variant isolated by gel electrophoresis. In this reaction, all four ribonucleotide triphos phates were labeled with P32 at the a-position. The RNA product of this reaction was purified twice by gel electrophoresis, hydrolyzed, and ana lyzed. Comparison with the base composition of the original Q0-RNA (Table 2) indicates that there has been a considerable (5%) increase in the G content of the variant RNA. On the other hand, A and C have decreased by 2.4%, the uridine content remaining constant. e. Kinetics of Q?, and variant RNA: A comparison of the kinetics of synthesis at saturation of the 75th variant and the original ts-Q?-RNA</page><page sequence="40">260 AMERICAN SCIENTIST reveals (Fig. 30) some interesting differences. It will be noted that the Q^-RNA shows the usual 6 minutes of nonlinear synthesis which precedes the linear phase. The variant has decreased this apparent lag to 1.5 min utes. Further, the slope of the linear portion of the variant synthesis is 2.6 times that of the original Q?-RNA. Since the variant is only 17% of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 MINUTES Fig. 30. A Comparison of the Kinetics of Synthesis of the 74th Variant and the Original ts-Q?-RNA. Two 0.25 ml standard reactions, one primed with gel purified single stranded variant RNA (74th transfer), and the other primed with ts-Q/?-RNA (both above saturation), were initiated at 35?C. 0.02 ml aliquote were drawn at times in dicated and assayed for incorporation of P32-UTP. Data are represented as cpm/0.02 ml. (Mills, Peterson, and Spiegelman, '67.) the original size, its growth rate in terms of the production of new indi viduals is fifteen times that of the complete viral RNA molecules. /. Potentialities of selection experiments: Our primary purpose was to demonstrate the potentialities of the replicase system for examining the extracellular evolution of a self-replicating nucleic acid molecule. Fur ther, the experimental situation provides its own paleology; every sam ple is kept frozen and can be expanded at will to yield the components</page><page sequence="41">AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A REPLICATING MOLECULE 261 occurring at that particular evolutionary stage. While only 7 such sam ples are detailed here, they indicate that progress to a small size occurs in a series of steps. It should be noted that we have learned how to mod ify the enzyme reaction so that this process is greatly accelerated. This involves changing the proportions of the two components (Eikhom and Spiegelman, '67) of the Q? replicase and will be reported subsequently. The last product examined in the present study is a molecule which has eliminated 83% of its original length and has experienced a significant change in base composition. The fact that it replicates 15 times faster than the complete viral RNA suggests that, in addition to becoming smaller, the variant has increased the efficiency with which it interacts with the replicase. In any event, the findings reported establish that neither the specific recognition nor the replicating mechanism require the complete original sequence. In this connection, it should be noted that, although abbreviated, these variants are not equivalent to random fragments. The latter are unable to complete the replicative act (Haruna and Spiegelman, '65b). The availability of a molecule which has discarded large and unneces sary segments provides an object with obvious experimental advantages for the analysis of many aspects of the replicative process. Finally, these abbreviated RNA molecules have a very high affinity for the replicase but are no longer able to direct the synthesis of virus particles. This feature opens up a novel pathway towards a highly specific device for interfering with viral replication. It should not escape the attention of the reader that the situation described places at our disposal a completely new method for the resolu tion of a variety of interesting problems. Potentially, other selective stresses can be imposed on the system to generate RNA entities which exaggerate other molecular features. M. Summary Experiments are described which show that a purified ' 'replicase" (an RNA dependent RNA Polymerase) can effect the synthesis of a product which is fully competent to serve both as a template and a pro gram for the synthesis of complete virus particles. The use of a mutant permitted the demonstration that the nucleic acid is the instructive agent in the replication process and hence satisfies the definition of a self-dup licating entity. A kinetic analysis of the synthesis revealed the existence of a latent period accompanied by an eclipse of the input templates as infectious agents. This is followed by the appearance of new infectious strands. The early stages of the synthetic cycle were examined in detail through the use of gel electrophoresis. These experiments employed H3-template</page><page sequence="42">262 AMERICAN SCIENTIST and the synthesized product was labeled with P32, permitting a simul taneous examination of the behavior of both. The data obtained are best summarized as follows: (a) All of the first product is found complexed to H3-template possessing the properties of Hofschneider (Francke and Hofschneider, '66a, b) Structures (HS); (6) Subsequently Franklin (Franklin, '66) Structures (FS); (c) Soon after the formation of FS, mature Q?-RNA appears. The temporal se quence is consistent with a mechanism involving the following series of events template HS FS Q?-RNA. The system described provided an opportunity for studying the evo lution of a self-replicating nucleic acid molecule outside a living cell. In particular, experiments were performed to explore the consequences of selection for fast growth. As the experiment progressed, the rate of RNA synthesis increased and the product became smaller. By the 74th transfer the replicating molecule had eliminated 83% of its original genome, at present the smallest known self-duplicating entity. Aside from their intrinsic interest, such studies can provide insight into a number of central issues. Thus, they can tell us the smallest self duplicating entity which can be constructed by such devices and pro vide much simpler objects for analyzing the replication process. Further, the sequences involved in the recognition mechanism between template and enzyme are enriched in the smaller molecules which evolve. Finally, these abbreviated molecules have a very high affinity for the replicase but are no longer able to direct the synthesis of virus particles. This feature opens up a novel pathway towards a highly specific device for interfering with viral RNA replication. LITERATURE CITED 1. Ammann, ., H. Delius, and P. H.
