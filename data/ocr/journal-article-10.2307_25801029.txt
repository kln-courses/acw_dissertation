<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tom Herron Mayo Littoral: Michael Longley's Eco-elegies It was to the West or, to be more precise, to certain privileged parts of the West that the re-discoverers of Ireland's ancient soul looked through a haze of mys tic wonder. The western seaboard and its islands were transformed in plays, poems, and translations of songs and folk tales from a series of "powerful com pensatory counter-images" into a fully fledged national form that Eamon de Valera would later re-imagine as a "frugal" republic.1 For the Revivalists, the Irish nation would be an expanded version of this West?which was, in fact, a simulacrum, a hyper-reality, having little or nothing to do with the conditions affecting the lives of most of the inhabitants whose lives were blighted by extreme poverty and hardship, by tension between tenant and landlord's agent, by the hemorrhage of emigration, and by the lingering effects of the Famine. At the very same time as it was being appropriated by the revivalists as the nation al ideal in microcosm, the West remained on the precarious edge of subsis tence."2 As Catherine Nash notes, "another West thus shadowed the celebration of the area by cultural nationalists."3 It comes as something of a shock, therefore, to realize that the West of Ire land continues to serve as the ultimate adventure park for writers, painters, and photographers in search of authentic Irish experience. The landscapes, place names, flora and fauna, traditional culture, and?to a strikingly limited degree?the people of the West, provide a realm in which signs are taken as marvels and where the artist figure can dwell, albeit temporarily, in a satisfyingly holistic relationship to an environment supposedly distinct from all other loca tions on the island.

For in spite of the west of Ireland's sta tus as a country of myth, the actual place can still awaken an appetite for expe rience that is pristine and unconstrained.4 Far from being peripheral, the West occupies a central place in Irish writing in general, and in poetry in particular. In continuing more-or-less unscathed into contemporary writing, the West, and journeys "into" it, constitutes perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Revivalists. In imagining a nation, the Revivalists almost always set up a rigid opposition between what Joep Leerssen terms "a materialist, vulgar, modern, down-to-earth East [and] a dreamy, mystical, time less West."5 For Leerssen, representations of the Celtic West, describe, not a place, but a direction, a penetration or an approach, a movement from the east to the west... not so much an arrival but rather a constant defer ral, a quest for the Other place, each stage of the journey being only a mid-way point towards the yet more distant mirage on, or just beyond, the horizon_ The Real Celtia is always an unspecified or unspecifiable Beyond.6 But which West are we talking about? Into which West are the artists and the writers drawn? Certainly not to the cities: Limerick, Cork, or Sligo. Nor to the towns: Ennis, Letterkenny, or Bundoran. The region into which they travel is the hard West, the Wild West.7 It is a largely unpeopled landscape of "Water and ground in their extremity."8 In opposition to the urban East and North, the poets' West is populated in the main by animals; it is a place in which the silence is broken only by the wind, by the crashing of Atlantic breakers, and by birds' 4.

Most strikingly, it is a place unscarred by the divisions that marked other locations, most notably those that deformed the northern statelet from its birth in 1921, but also the class and wealth divisions across the entire island. Allured by the West's spatial, cultural, and ecological differences, it is toward Donegal, Connemara, Clare, and Mayo that the poets incline; the Rosses, the Aran Islands, Achill, and the Burren. Louis MacNeice, in his 1945 poem "Western Landscape," could distil an essential Irish westernness without naming a single place. For contemporary poets it is precisely the remote places with names that strangers find difficult to manage to which they are drawn.9 It is in such phonetically, rhythmically, and linguistically charged places as Inishmaan, Gaoth Dobhair, Gweebarra, Mweel rea, Inis Eoghain, Carrigskeewaun, Inis Oirr, and Ahascragh that the poets find their "quintessential west."10 This West becomes a realm where language attains what Heaney calls a "free state of image and allusion," where poetic language finds congruence between place and noun, between the habits and behaviors of animals and verb, between the vagaries of the weather and atmospheric condi tions and adjective.11 In short, it is the Irish poetic space par excellence. Much of this poetry finds the poet not yet in situ in the West, but on his or her way there, echoing the element of pilgrimage to the holy and mystical sites of the West to be found in much Revivalist writing. Indeed, many contemporary poems of the Irish West incorporate a car journey that takes the poet-traveler from the East to the West, and sometimes back again in possession of some thing that will be used to fortify existence back in the dreary East. This poetry shares many features of other forms of travel writing: the escape from the quo tidian, a sense of restlessness, a constant deferral of arrival, the experience of deterritorialization, the search for spectacle, the flickering vistas and occlusions offered by the automobile as "vision machine," a sense of the exotic, of anxiety, of unhomeliness.12 And also of expectation. "We travel hopefully," as the theorist of tourism Angela Mehegan said, believing deep down that something out of the ordinary will occur on our journey.13 In this poetry there is, more often than not, a ten 9.

On the one hand, the poetry of westward journeys yearns for a cratylian equivalence of place and poem, so that the latter would signify per fectly not only the essence of the former, but would also render, in suitably dra matic terms, the labor expended by the poet in arriving at that equivalence. On the other, it is a poetry that smacks of the holiday memento, of the souvenir: of, in other words, tourist kitsch. These poems of "cottage and curragh" are con stituted within what John Urry has famously termed the "tourist gaze," that form of scopophilic desire that renders everything seen on vacation into out standing experience, and transforms mere signs and sights into wonders that can be largely foreseen. Sensing the kind of mythologization at work in this westward vectorialism, John Redmond asks, "And why did we call the road west the road west / when we drove east on it as much as west?"15 But the puzzle remains: in a period of marked skepticism toward the Revivalists' fetishization of the West as an alternative to all things Anglo-Saxon, contemporary poets nonetheless appear to be in thrall to a neo-Celticism that encourages them to look to the West in ways not dissimilar to the imaginings of their Revivalist forefathers and foremothers. The West of these tourist traveller poets is by no means identical to that of the Revivalists. While thatched cottages, turf stacks, smoky fires, lonely strands, and perilous boat journeys out to the islands persist as favorite signifiers of the West, the unravelling undertaken by, in Terence Brown's phrase, the "counter revivalists" has itself fed into contemporary versions.16 If we accept Seamus Heaney's sentiment that the West of Ireland is indeed a myth, and if we factor in to our consideration Joep Leerssen's sense that writing of the West has more to do with a powerful vectorialism than with specific place, then we are led to see the West as a sort of "non-locus," in which there is little for the poets to do but gaze and then continue on their way.

Whereas Lon gley stays put, his fellow poets are constantly on the move to, through, and away from the West. In one of his earliest poems, Derek Mahon drives from Belfast to Donegal and back in a day.17 Tom Paulin drives west to Gweebarra Bay with the mantra "Gweebarra: echoing in his head.18 On an earlier occasion he looks west from the bungalow on the unapproved road to the Bluestack Mountains in southern Donegal.19 Paul Muldoon?on Good Friday, 1971?drives across Ulster to Gaoth Dobhair in Donegal, and on the way hits something on the road.20 James Simmons "reverses six times / or more up narrow lanes" seeking out an ancient cairn at Cloncha on the Inishowen peninsula.21 Seamus Heaney drives for a day around the same peninsula.22 Later, he remembers driving through "the empty amphitheatre / Of the west."23 And then, unforgettably, and more persuasively than any Discover Ireland advertisement, he urges his read er "to drive out west / Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore."24 And, of course, it is not only poets from the North who take the road West ward.

While retaining an affection for the Wests mythical properties, this poetry is unavoidably supplemented by self-consciousness, skepticism, and irony. It is also imbued with an awareness of the West's contingency to other parts of the island where such Utopian imaginings?especially during the darkest days of the Northern Ireland conflict?would have been foolhardy. It was indeed the period known as the "Troubles" that encouraged a new generation of poets to look to the West as a respite from the chaos on the streets around them. In the work of northern Catholic writers produced in this peri od there is a litany of unfairnesses, fears, insults, interrogations, surveillances, threats, and acts of state-sanctioned violence. The fact that just over the border there was a place in which such degradations of existence did not occur meant that many Catholics and nationalists did, indeed, gravitate there, both physically (particularly on holidays and frequent trips over the border during the summer months when the Orange Order and loyalist community indulged in their unpleasant annual performances of supremacy) and mythically, in a sense of projecting onto that West a sense of belonging as confirmation of a cultural identity that was ruthlessly interdicted in the north. The West-just-beyond-the-border was a tangible reminder of what had been lost through the cruel farce of Partition. As such, it was a zone imbued as much with melancholy as with a sense of imagined freedom. The reasons that so many Northern Protestant poets?MacNeice, Hewitt, Mahon, Simmons, Paulin, and, of course, Longley?shared this western vectorialism are perhaps less obvious, but not a world away, from the situation of their fellow Northern Catholic writers. Luke Gibbons suggests that the appeal of the West to Yeats and Synge "lay precisely in the fact that it offered a refuge from ... a puritan ethos, from the suffocating moral atmosphere of an Ireland dominated by the emer gent bourgeoisie, both Catholic and Protestant."29 The West may well have rep resented a similar sense of refuge for poets who, like MacNeice, had a powerfully hyphenated sense of identity, or who, like Mahon, turn away from his "native Ulster / the bigots shrieking for their beleaguered culture'."30 Other poets, like Longley, sense an affinity with the West based on a sedimentary accumulation of experience gained in a particular part of it, and on a capacious imagination that sees no insurmountable barrier between British, Irish, and European liter ary heritages. 29.

Diminutive though it is, Longleys West is a place to be mined for its marvels, to be co-opted into formal literary representation; it is a place seemingly outside history, in which nature and the natural predominate. Crucially, it is also a place from which the essence can be extracted and carried back to other locations, the North in particular. His West provides an alternative ecology to that subsisting in the North. Almost all of Longley s poetry of the West articulates a desire for eco-relationship, for equitable living with animals in a terrain in which they are at "home" and in which he is the visitor. Divisions are unknown here: instead, this is a place in which the poet figure can find respite, can turn to the flowers and the animal life alongside which he searches for an ethical way to live. During the "Troubles," it was also a place that was both contaminated by the violence occuring just a few miles to the north and east, and was nonetheless able to offer sanctuary from the worst excesses of that violence. Proffered as a linguistic-floral gift, an ecological and asyndetonic salve in the face of sectarian murder and its traumatic effects on those left behind, Longley's "The Ice-cream Man" is a case in point: I named for you all the wild flowers of the Burren I had seen in one day: thyme, valerian, loosestrife, Meadowsweet, tway blade, crowfoot, ling, angelica, Herb robert, marjoram, cow parsley, sundew, vetch, Mountain avens, wood sage, ragged robin, stitchwort, Yarrow, lady's bedstraw, bindweed, bog pimpernel.31 And in his now-famous statement that "I want the light from Carrigskeewaun to irradiate the northern darkess,"32 Longley extends the Revivalist celebration of all things western as a means of supplementing the deficits in other parts of the island. But now, rather than inventing a sovereign nation, the artists task is to carry the light from one part of the island to another degraded, damaged, broken part of the territory, as if that territory's people were incapable of deal ing?no matter how protractedly nor how messily?with the darkness that such a valorization of all things rural, beautiful, and natural implies. In accordance with the Western sublime registered by Revivalists and post Revivalists alike, the ecological relationship captured within the poetry neglects, almost entirely, local intra-human contact, as if human beings were somehow 31.

This omission leaves human agency in the actual damage and potential destruction of the environmental inter connectedness of all things?the animal and plant life, the earth and, yes, other human beings?entirely unconsidered. Also neglected are the efforts of individuals and collectives to resist such degradations. We do, of course, encounter the occasional human figure in Longley's poetry of the West?Joe O'Toole, Joseph Murphy, Paddy Morrison, and David and Penny Cabot feature significantly, but isolatedly?but we find precious little sense of community, save where members of that community have unwittingly contributed to the destruction of the supposed burial mound at Templedoomore: "Locals have driven their tractors along the strand / And tugged apart the wooden wreck for gateposts" (CP 305). It is not the place of a critic to prescribe what poets should include in their poetry, nor to bemoan the lack of certain elements. But the near absence of human beings in this poetry is striking, and demands comment. Where, in this poetry, are the libraries, the sheltered housing, the tourist information offices, and so forth? One senses that yet again we are looking at a West that maintains its mythical status?in this case, by eradicating the natives whose presence would only sully the pristine ecological experiences on offer to the visitor. With a handful of exceptions the people of the West, the people who actually live there, are nowhere to be seen in Irish poetry. Not seen and not heard. The social fabric of the towns and villages of the western parts of Ireland is almost entirely absent: a demonstrably "real" West thus continues to shadow the West of the poets. The 2006 collection of poetry and photographs assembled by Macdara Woods and Jim Vaughan, Present Tenses; Words and Pictures, functions as something of a corrective to the birdcall-punctuated silence that prevails in almost all of Longley's Mayo poetry. Alongside photgraphs of lilies, turf stacks, and famine ridges, and poems about oystercatchers at Dooega and abandoned villages, there are photographs of pensioners playing indoor bowls at St Brendan's Village, Muranny, of young men armwrestling in a pub in Geesala, of a young man wearing an "I y Techno" tee-shirt, of the Sawdoctors playing at Castlebar, and poems about the Oxfam Shop in the same town, and how the killing of John Charles de Menezes reverberated around Mayo. No poems by Michael Longley appear in this volume.33 Admittedly, the foregoing characterization of Longley's poetry of the West is too general and is overly crude. In many ways, his work departs markedly from the 33. Present Tense: Poems and Photographs from County Mayo, ed. Macdara Woods and Jim Vaughan (Castlebar: Mayo County Council, 2006). 8i</page><page sequence="9">Michael Longleys Eco-elegies neo-Celticist canon of poetry set out earlier. His poetic center of gravity is indeed Mayo, but there are few gestures toward the place as either a post Revivalist Utopia or a counter-Revivalist fallen Eden. Similarly, the poems engage only slightly with other literary or pictorial renderings of Mayo?for instance, those of Synge, Paul Henry, MacNeice, or Mahon?although the words and images of these artists are spectrally present in Longley s work. Longley is a holiday-maker in the West, spending his "fortnight among the waterbirds" (CP 323), but he is not exactly a tourist there. He stays put in one place; or rather, he ranges time and again over an actual territory thoroughly familiar to his readers. His is a low-lying world of small rivers and lakes, dry stone walls, cottages, duachs, and cairns. It is a world of animals (otters, hares, badgers, seals), and of plant life (bog myrtle, pale butterwort, silverweed, marsh marigolds, vetch, petalwort, blue perriwinkle, tansy, meadowsweet). Overwhelmingly, Longley s Mayo is a world of birds: whooper swan, mallard, kittiwake, sanderling, lapwing, golden plover, snow bunting, widgeon, peregrine, sandpiper, skylark, snipe, curlew, stonechat, lark, snow goose, heron, dipper, robin, merlin, wheatear, raven, house sparrow, wren, and many other species feature prominently. More than any other contemporary poet, Longley has embraced and extended the veritable aviary that constitutes the Irish poetic tradition. A holiday-maker he may be, but at the same time, in capturing moments of intensity in his delicately phrased lyric poems, he is also aware of the threats to the landscape to which his poetry responds: "the most urgent political problems are ecological: how we share the planet with the plants and other animals. My nature writing is my most political."34 In recent years, the political realities that have abutted against, and intruded upon this landscape have been less the killings and reprisals, followed by the maneuverings and the fragile resolution of the Northern conflict, but rather, the ecological degradations inflicted on the western seaboard of Ireland. Blasted heaths and polluted rivers are not the subject matter of these poems; yet, throughout Longley s oeuvre, we perceive an increasing sense of environmental danger. It is by means of specifically minor forms that Longley's poetry emerges as political, as, to borrow Heaney's resonant term, a steadfast form of "redress." But only within limits. Minor literature is, as Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari remind us, a form of writing that works in the margins of dominant discourse, and is of necessity, therefore, a political form.35 The elegy?the dominant mood of Longley s verse?is a countervailing conservative force that 34- Randolph, "Interview," 12. 35.

Dana Polan (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986). 82</page><page sequence="10">Michael Longley's Eco-elegies does much to neutralize minor literatures refusal of monumental statement and formal procedures. There are many reasons to term this a "minor" poetry: the slight lyric that is the poet's preferred form; its attention to low-key events; and Longley's refusal to monumentalize into symbol or allegory the creatures and the topography that surround him. It is also important to register the severely bounded nature of a territory that, prior to Longley, appears not to have featured before in writing in either Gaelic or Hiberno-English. Longley's territory encompasses a tract of land measuring no more than two kilometres square, bounded to the south by Killary Harbour, to the southwest by the Mweel Rea Mountains, to the west by sand dunes and machair that stretch from Allaran Point up to Legha Mor by Kinnadoohy, to the east by the Bunowen River, and to the north by the townlands of Roonkeel, Kinnadoohy, and, on the coast, Barnaboun Point; it seems hardly adequate nor accurate to apply the grand term "the West" or even "Western" to this territory. The poems register almost every known place designator on the map and in the territory: Dooaghtry, Roonkeel, Clew Bay, Cloonaghmanagh, Allaran Point, Tonakeera, Mweelrea, Lackakeely, the Owennadornaum, the Carricknashinnagh shoal, Templedoomore, Claggan, Corragaun Lake, Six Noggins, Thallabaun, Caher Island, Killadoon and, most often, Carrigskeewaun. Although Longley treasures these placenames, he is little inclined to delve into etymologies, philologies, and translations.36 He is still less tempted by the lure of dinnseanchas, the lore of place and placenames, or of national allegory. In fact, given the intensity with which he scrutinizes this small area, one of the most surprising aspects of Longley's Mayo poetry is that it has a remarkably deterritorialized relation to land and landscape. There is little sense of ownership or belonging, and objects that appear to him in this marvellous realm are rendered in a language and in dialects?Hiberno-English and Scots Irish?that are not only foreign to this place, but were imposed onto its and its inhabitants with a good deal of epistemological and military violence. This linguistic history?which is, of course, a history of dispossession, does not register in the work. There is no sense therefore that the poetry is attempting to shape something into definition, nor that it is producing a local mythology. On the contrary, Longley's Mayo poetry is a rhizomatic series of "takes," instances, fleetings, movements, becomings and unbecomings that, over time, build into a loosely defined map or log of moments of intense engagements with animals and the landscape. Longley's posture toward the territory is also a minor one in the sense that he professes barely no insider knowledge, no sense of mastery. A comparison with, say, Heaney's archeological excavations of what lies 36. Every placename featured in Longley's poetry of Mayo is of course an Anglicized version of the "original" Irish. 83</page><page sequence="11">Michael Longleys Eco-elegies beneath, reveals just how slight is Longleys tenure of the language and the landscape it denotes. This sense of a deterritorialized stance toward the land and its inhabitants is even more pointed if Longleys poetry is compared to Cathal 0 Searcaigh 's sense of the landscape as an intimately known text in 'Here at Caiseal na gCorr Station: This is the poem-book of my people, the manuscript they toiled at with the ink of their sweat. Here every enclosed field is like a verse in the great poem of land reclamation.37 The land of which Longley writes is decidedly not his own, and not his natal place. His poem "Heron," which is both an elegy to his friend the poet Kenneth Koch, and at the same time a beautifully handled deflation of many of those dependable features of his poetry, displays a disarmingly humorous awareness of the situation: You would have loved the sandy drive over the duach ('The what?'), over the machair ('the what?'), the drive Through the white gateposts and the galvanized gate Tied with red string, the starlings' sleeping quarters, The drive toward turf-fired hilarity and disbelief, 'Where are all those otters, Longley, and all those hares? I see only sparrows here and house sparrows at that!' (CP 323) Koch 's ghost voices both the expectations of the visitor to the West and the simultaneous disappointment with what the West yields. Mayo enjoys a fair share of bird and animal life, but it is not distinguished for its fauna; elsewhere, Longley registers "the otters we haven't seen for years" (CP 292). The poem fore grounds an ignorance within both poets. In explaining the meaning of "Car rigskeewaun" to his American friend, Longley is less than authoritative on the placename's etymology, stating that it means "so far as I know, The Rock of the Wall Fern" (CP 323). Furthermore, in needing to have explained to him the meanings of "duach" and "machair," Koch not only displays an outsider's linguistic unfamiliarity, but also reveals a lack of attention to the poetry Longley has produced since his "comeback" volume Gorse Fires (1991) a volume that was sparked into life by the poet's long sojourn in Mayo during a fallow time in his writing career. These two words have been scattered through every volume Longley has produced since Gorse Fires, and the poet has painstakingly set out a glossary of terms in 37- Cathal 0 Searcaigh, "Here at Caiseal na gCorr Station." trans.

What is at issue is the humor of Longley's self-deprecation and repartee with his dead friend. What is also powerfully evident is the way in which Longley's imaginative geography can expand to such an extent that he shares a "townland / That encloses Carrigskeewaun and Central Park."39 The placenames "unknown to most"40 are freely open to anyone and everyone. Coming to a Michael Longley poem of the West of Ireland, we tend to find him already in place, watching the birds through binoculars, lying on the machair, observing and naming its flora?sometimes swimming beyond Allaran Point, sometimes wading across the Owennadornaun. The poet, like John Clare, is often close to the ground, eye-level to flowers and small animals. But for all its apparent repetitiveness?which, in a recent poem prompts the poet to offer something of an autocritique: "I am writing too much about Carrigskeewaun" (CP 328)?Longley's western territory is in fact a changing, threatened place. In the course of the four decades in which he has attended steadfastly to the flora, fauna, and natural history to be found in and around his "home from home" (CP 69), he has been at pains to register at all times the potential damage of human intrusion into the landscape and the territory of animals. Often, it is his own presence that is a source of potential damage: one of his earliest poems of Mayo, "The Path," part of the Carrigskeewaun sequence, deflates any quasi-religious resonances that the word "path" might suggest by dramatizing the ineluctable clumsiness of human activity. Such activity leads, not to immanent communion with his fellow avian beings, but to multiple lines of flights away from the poet. The poem enacts the epistemological vio lence inflicted on any representation of animal Otherness by reverting to a weak anthropomorphism in its final line. At the same time, there is a type of knowledge uncovered on this blundering journey through a landscape of birds: With my first step I dislodge the mallards Whose necks strain over the bog to where Kittiwakes scrape the waves: then, the circle 38.

(CP 68) Indeed, any human presence is registered as a kind of violence in itself, as here in the untitled epigraph to The Echo Gate (1979): I have heard of an island With only one house on it. The gulls are at home there. Our perpetual absence Is a way of leaving All the eggs unbroken That litter the ground Right up to its doorstep. (CP 113) Yet, this awareness of the fragility of things does not particularly debilitate his imaginative rendering of bird and animal life. It does, however, introduce a cau tion into any representation of the other animal. Twenty years later the poet is still aware of the danger that he, as a representative of humanity, poses. But occa sionally, there are wonderful moments of blessedly insubstantial meeting between species, such as that captured in startling syntactical fluidity in "The Comber": A moment before the comber turns into A breaker?sea-spray, raggedy rainbows? Water and sunlight contain all the colours And suspend between Inishbofin and me The otter, and thus we meet, without my scent In her nostrils, the uproar of my presence, My unforgivable shadow on the sand? Even if this is the only sound I make. (CP 243) There has always been, in Longley's Mayo poetry, a sense of desolation bred by place itself: skulls, bones, erosion, unravelling, tidal and wind erosion, are all common designators of this territory. It is a place of dispersals and disappear ances; a place that poses a certain risk to identity, and even to survival. In some ways, it is a wonder that anyone can live there, as Longley notes in "Landscape": I am clothed, unclothed By racing cloud shadows, Or else disintegrate Like a hillside neighbour Erased by sea mist. A place of dispersals Where the wind fractures 86</page><page sequence="14">Michael Longley's Eco-elegies Flight-feathers, insect wings And rips thought to tatters Like a fuschia petal. (CP 91) Balanced against this there is plenitude and surprise; there are such marvels as the gifts flung onto the lane by the encroaching sea in "Spring Tide": The spring tide has ferried jelly fish To the end of the lane, pinks, purples, Wet flowers beside the floating cow pats. (CP 125) There is a sense, too, that this is a terrain where identity can be fashioned along lines very different to those denominational, class, and gender definitions that trammel existence elsewhere. So, as well as the tendency to disappear into this landscape?"self-effacement in sand" (CP 290) ?there is a corresponding series of "becomings" in which the poet's trains of thought, and body, and human identity are figured in commerce?sometimes conflictual, at other times har monious?with his fellow animals.41 Increasingly, however, there is a darkening of the townland's radiance, a sense not exactly of depletion, but of threat. In "Lapwing," the poet is unsettled partly by the "poisoned swan unfolding on Davids pond / like a paper flower in a saucer" (CP 243). "Flight Feathers" recalls "all of the birds that have disappeared" (CP 288). Longley has responded to this emptying of the skies and darkening of hope by suggesting that he is responding to new threats to the environment; but it is important to note that alongside his concern with ecology under threat, there is also a convolution of personal decline played out on an amenable landscape. This is an autobiographical landscape, in that the landscape is amenable to the often anguished vicissitudes of the poet's own life, among them death and grief, especially with his mourning poems for friends. This obsessive concern articulates itself most obviously in the elegy. Elegy is always a belated form. It rehearses and, to a degree, revels in the defeat of life by the overwhelming force of death's oblivion. Alchemical in nature, elegy attempts to make something, to retain something, out of nothingness. But there are questions to be asked when a particular landscape is the ground upon which the poet rehearses again and again his obsession with death. There is something troubling about a construction of the West as a screen onto which are projected the poet's fears and fantasies. This melding of melancholy and Mayo is a distinctive strand in Longley's work, amounting to a blanketing of a landscape 4i. The term "becoming" is now most commonly associated with Deleuze and Guattari and sig nifies new, provisional, mobile articulations of the multiple "self "in relation to other beings and phenomena: see, in particular, "Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible," in A Thousand Plateaus, trans.

Collection Crawford Art Gallery, Cork. with the poet's obsessions. Throughout the Mayo poems, Longley colors landscape with his seemingly inescapable and interminable mourning, which finds expression in a place that?once again?is stereotyped as a fitting place for such meditations. A fine allegory for the situation in which the visitor poet finds himself or herself once "way out west" is to be found in Gerard Dillon's 1950 painting, Island People, now held by the Crawford Municipal Gallery in Cork. Born in West Belfast, Dillon (1916-1971) turned for inspiration time and again to the West of Ireland, and to Achill Island in particular. What is most striking about many of Dillon's bold Chagall-like paintings is that, like Jack Yeats's work col lected in the 1912 volume Life in the West of Ireland, they are populated.42 These 42. Jack B. Yeats's remarkable Life in the West of Ireland (Dublin and London: Maunsel, 1912) depicts a community fully alive to modernity: for example, children play with imported Japanese toys, and crowds are entertained by traveling circuses. 88</page><page sequence="16">Michael Longley's Eco-elegies are paintings full of people doing things, making things, engaged in work and commerce. But in Dillon s Island People, the artist?head-down, back-turned, his canvas borne like a cross?seems to climb the road. An envelope or bubble of white space separates him from what a recent commentator on the painting called the "the vibrant life" and the people around him: past the slug-like curraghs and the upturned kelp cart and ruined cottage, to the sea.43 The paint ing seems a little tragic, but at the same time it is funny and knowing. Island People gives us a scene of frugal, but nonetheless productive and well-ordered rural economy in which various figures?two of them natives and one of them an outsider?share a tightly organized but unrestrictive hetereotopia. Dillon understands both the seductions and the absurdities of the West's allure. He recognizes and captures its tremendously powerful gravitational pull on the artist searching out sights but also its insistence that the artist remains an outsider, a gazer, one who essentially takes from the landscape. To be sure, poets are not at the vanguard of the industrial-political apparatus that has resulted in the degradations visited upon great swathes of the earth and on its inhabitants, human and nonhuman alike. But a sectional view can do nothing except lament what has already gone. The proper terrain of ecological concern is the world in toto and not in parvo: opting for the latter inevitably leads to nothing more than liberal lamentation for what is disappearing. Just as the Revivalists turned away from the East?and the imperial power associated with that East?to a mystical West, there is a danger in a similar latter-day vectorialism that turns its back on the actual, real, economic forces that result in the ecological emergency underway. For the contemporary Irish poet, a renovated type of turning away from political reality is that of looking to, and even elegizing, the West. Longley him self seems to understand that his elegizing has no real impact on the world, admitting in "Leopardi's Song Thrush" that his "lamentation" amounts to little more than "a batsqueak from the balcony" (CP 277). The question is whether in times of ecological emergency, the elegy?imbued as it is with belatedness, with melancholy, with the alchemical translation of deathly non-meaning into things of beauty, allied to the curious self-regarding that attends all elegizing? is a suitable form of redress against the forces acting against the well-being of all the earth s people.
