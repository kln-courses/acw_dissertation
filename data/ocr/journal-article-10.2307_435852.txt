<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE METEMPSYCHOSIS JANEL M. MUELLER For though through many streights, and lands I roame, I launch at paradise, and saile toward home.... [56-57] Although investigations of Renaissance aesthetic are currently in vogue, no one has yet tried to account for the appearance of Donne's Metempsychosis at the head of the first edition of his Poems in 1633. The fact that the poem was given the place usually assigned either to the poet's masterpiece or to his earliest production of note (Milton put the "Nativity Ode" at the head of his 1645 Poems) has remained an indifferent curiosity. Obviously a set of stanzas in- scribed "16 Augusti 1601" comes too late to qualify as the most significant of Donne's juvenilia. Equally obviously, to most twen- tieth-century eyes, the Metempsychosis has seemed no major work, undeserving of a place of recognition. But if the merits of this fragment of 520 lines have gone un- sought, its presumed defects, by contrast, have been extensively remarked in our time. Scholars and critics of Donne have been at pains to prove this work, rather than the formerly disdained Anniversaries, his principal poetic blunder. It is true that the Metempsychosis is unfinished, but Donne soon got in arrears also with the "yearly rent" of the Anniver- saries. This has never been held against him. Nor can the incompleteness of a work from the Renaissance, a heyday of over- weening projects, bar it from serious con- sideration. There is more to the critical history of the Metempsychosis. In par- ticular, it is an illustration of two truths that no honest scholar or critic would deny: first, that we tend to find in a poem only what we expect to find, and that therefore we must resist the impulse to turn working hypotheses into critical conclusions without clear warrant from the text itself; and, second, that no one (or almost no one- the exceptions are few) can be brought to admire what he does not understand. I propose to reopen judgment on Donne's Metempsychosis by way of surveying what has been concluded about it and on what grounds. Then I shall discuss the questions of poetic form and source materials (on which I find a number of new things to be said). I shall try to elucidate the artistry and contents of this poem beyond the state of understanding at present. If I do not manage to raise the esteem of the Metem- psychosis, I hope at least to make it a more intelligible-and hence more tolerable- failure. I In the critical history of the Metem- psychosis the one constant has been the difficulty of the poem. Despite its diffi- culty, in the centuries preceding ours the work received favorable if select notice. It caught the attention of two eminent seven- teenth-century poet-critics, Ben Jonson and Andrew Marvell, who in recognizing the necessity of explication paid the Metem- psychosis the tribute of a serious attempt. Jonson was confident of the importance of the themes of change and heresy, al- though his several inaccuracies about the text as we have it have caused his remarks to be undervalued. "The Conceit of Dones [Modern Philology, November 1972] 109</page><page sequence="2">110 JANEL M. MUELLER transformation or Metempsychosis," Jon- son told Drummond, "was that he sought the soule of that Aple which Eva pulled and therafter made it the soule of a Bitch, then of a shee-wolf, &amp; so of a woman. His generall purpose was to have brought in all the bodies of the Hereticks from ye soule of Cain &amp; at last left it in ye body of Calvin. Of this he never wrotte but one sheet, &amp; now since he was made Doctor repenteth highlie." 1 Marvell, along similar lines, as- sociated his own sardonic account of the shifts and temporizings of an ecclesiastical opponent with Donne's Metempsychosis. But Marvell also significantly emphasized the victimization and denigration which the soul suffered in its transmutations: Upon consideration of so various an identity, methinks, after so many years, I begin to understand Doctor Donne's Progress of the Soul, which passed through no fewer revo- lutions, and had hitherto puzzled all its readers. After this soul had passed thorow so many brutes, and been hunted from post to pillar, its last receptacle was in the human nature, and it housed itself in a female con- ception; which, after it came to years of consent, was married to Cain by the name of Themech. This was the sum of that witty fable of Doctor Donne's.2 Between Donne's century and ours, Pope commended the Metempsychosis to Spence as one of Donne's "best things." De Quincey found "the fervent and gloomy sublimity of Ezekiel and Aeschylus" in the work, and Charles Lamb remarked on "this admirable poem."'3 But the discern- ible tendency in post-seventeenth-century criticism to render judgment on the Metem- psychosis apart from explication came to a head in Grierson's pronouncements in the preface to his influential 1912 edition of Donne's poetry. Grierson's judgment is particularly revealing in its mingled expres- sions of censure and incomprehension: "The 'wit' of Donne did not apparently include invention, for many of the episodes seem pointless as well as disgusting, and indeed in no poem is the least attractive side of Donne's mind so clearly revealed, that aspect of his wit which to some readers is more repellent, more fatal to his claim to be a poet, than too subtle ingenuity or misplaced erudition-the vein of sheer ugliness which runs through his work, presenting details that seem merely and wantonly repulsive."4 Grierson was more influential, however, in setting a critical trend away from expli- cation of the Metempsychosis toward biographical and psychological surmise. That precious date, "16 Augusti 1601" (for Donne dated almost none of his poems), was six months after the execution of Essex and four months before Donne's clandes- tine marriage. Since it is a generally sound inference with Donne (more so than with Chapman, whose theory it was) that obscurity has a purpose, could the Metem- psychosis be a record of secret thoughts and feelings? Grierson decided that it was. He suggested that Essex's death motivated the poem, and that Donne, as a Roman Catho- lic, sought to take poetic revenge by expos- ing the queen as the arch-heretic of human history. M. M. Mahood elaborated on the imputed motive of vilifying Elizabeth with such thoroughness that the Metempsychosis came to seem a cryptogram: "This obscure poem probably contains many now un- intelligible covert slurs upon the Queen and her ministers." Still, the themes of the poem had an impact even in Miss Mahood's atmosphere of innuendo. She observed 1 Conversations with William Drummond of Hawthornden, in Ben Jonson, ed. C. H.

Even W. A. Murray, who alone among twentieth-century scholars has made Phi- lonic allegory his frame of reference, calls the date and personal circumstances "a fact of the first importance for our under- standing" of the Metempsychosis. For Murray, Donne's poem is ultimately to be viewed as "the result of his reactions to his own dilemma."'7 Douglas Bush, while evincing wry surprise at the "brutal sexuality we might not expect from a young man who in a few months was to lose all for love,"8 accepts Murray's allegorical con- struction as well as the notion that the poem's importance is psychological and biographical. Yet such agreement with Murray's perspectives has entailed no agreement about the value of the Metem- psychosis. Murray himself ends in qualified admiration, but Bush's judgment that this is on the whole "a rather dull extrava- ganza" expresses much more nearly the majority position. Next to Grierson's, Don Cameron Allen's censures of the Metempsychosis, as set out in a 1952 essay,9 have weighed most heavily in twentieth-century estimates of the poem. The discussion by Allen con- tains a number of important recognitions -among them, that establishing sources (which he attempts) is a crucial matter, and that the epic form (with the Spenserian overtones which he notes) was a basic part of Donne's poetic undertaking. But there is a certain unclarity at the heart of Allen's declared critical principle, and the result is an importing of psychological implica- tions into what is ostensibly a literary- that is, a formal and thematic-approach. According to Allen, "the major factor" in "the success or failure of a poem" is "the theme, by which I mean the warping or bias that a poet gives to his pre-text (the impulsion from which a poem is born)." 10 On the one hand, Allen proceeds to evalu- ate the Metempsychosis with regard to themes and form. Taking off from the extremely varied tonality of the work, he concludes successively that Donne's im- pulsion (here purely poetic) was contra- dictory: that he attempted the impossible in venturing to write epic and satire, to deal in history and myth, to treat the universal and the particular simultaneously. Allen also concludes that Donne's theme was rendered unworkable by the very mixed regard in which Pythagoras was held by Donne's classical and Renaissance predecessors. He charges Donne with an untenable point of view in the poem, one combining "patristic indignation" and "Lucianic mirth." On the other hand, when Allen's indictment is complete, implying nothing less than the total incoherence of the Metempsychosis, the ultimate cause is projected as Donne's having been at cross- purposes with himself in an immature state of mind. Thereafter Allen credits Donne with having salvaged the poetic poten- 5Poetry and Humanism (London, 1950), pp. 105-7. My objections to the tendencies of biographical criticism of the Metempsychosis have been anticipated in part by W. A. Murray in "What Was the Soul of the Apple?" Review of English Studies, n.s. 10 (1959): 143, 153-54. 6 See R. E. Bennett, "John Donne and the Earl of Essex," Modern Language Quarterly 3 (1942): 603-4; Milgate, p. xxxii. 7 "What Was the Soul of the Apple?" p. 141. The substance of Murray's interpretation is an attempted application of Philo's notion of mesi phronisis, or "middle thought," by which things of a contrary nature are distinguished from each other. The insuperable difficulty with Murray's interpretation is its irreconcilability with the emphatic determinism govern- ing the universe of the Metempsychosis.

MUELLER tialities of "the progresse of the soule" when he wrote the Second Anniversary."1 Recalling, however, Jonson's and Mar- vell's emphasis on explication of the Metempsychosis, one notes how many questions have been sidestepped or ignored in Allen's discussion. Does the Metem- psychosis belong to the genre of satire ? Is it about Pythagoras? What can be said about "the progresse of the soule" in the terms of this poem, which after all affords a treatment very different from and in- dependent of that in the Second Anniver- sary ? What kinds of connections are there between a confused state of mind and an incoherent work of art? Despite such questions, the main aspects of Allen's line of criticism have persisted in the two most recent treatments of the Metempsychosis: Wesley Milgate's in his 1967 edition, where the question of genre is decided by group- ing the poem with Donne's five satires as an abortive but forward-looking mock epic, and George Williamson's determina- tion in a 1969 article 12 that the faltering of this poem was retrieved in Donne's suc- cessful satirical handling of heresy in Ignatius His Conclave. Williamson exhibits particularly clearly the confusion of biographical and literary considerations which traces back to Allen. Williamson begins by noting pertinently that "the mood which informs Donne's Metempsychosis" is that of the memorable lines in "The Calme" on "a rotten state, and hope of gaine," "the queasie paine / Of being belov'd, and loving," and "the thirst / Of honour, or faire death." But he moves quickly to pronounce in the matter of genre: "Such a state of mind later transforms a familiar story into a satire." Or, as Williamson says more fully later: "Donne uses his Pythagorean doc- trine to justify his narrative, and.. . he translates Genesis into a satirical alle- gory."13 Williamson's analysis of the Metempsychosis is predicated on the as- sumption that it is satire, which in turn leads him to concur with Allen that the heavy complement of epic machinery is not adapted to satiric purposes and that Donne did better afterward with his mate- rials. Milgate too presupposes that the Metem- psychosis is fundamentally a satire. He infers its nature from the indisputable fact that Donne was seeking new directions in the poem, and he remarks aptly on the first occurrence in it of "neo-Platonic, cab- balistical, rabbinical, and neo-Pythagorean speculation," which makes its influence felt in Donne's verse after 1601. Milgate is also freshly appreciative of the realism of Donne's narrative and the sensory im- mediacy of his fictive universe. But in larger poetic considerations Milgate taxes Donne severely, complaining in the Metem- psychosis of a "confusion of the traditional poetic 'Kinds' such as had never before been devised"-an incompatibility, surely recognizable to any Renaissance poet, between "the epic, which elevated man's achievement in the high style" and "satire, which exposed men's folly and vice in the low style." Milgate extends the implica- tions of an inappropriate hybrid genre and an unworkable central conceit into the harsh charge that Donne gave himself over to pretense and poetic unseriousness. Milgate concludes that Donne attempted "to exploit familiar material in an unortho- dox way, to achieve an askewness, an ironic perverseness which looks more fundamental than it really is." 14 The difficulty with the above assertions is, of course, that any work can be blamed for what it is not. Twentieth-century criticism of the Metempsychosis has dealt 11 Ibid., pp. 89-93. 12 "Donne's Satirical Progresse of the Soule," ELH 36 (1969): 250-64. 13 Ibid., pp. 251,253. 14 Milgate, pp. xxv-xxxiii.</page><page sequence="5">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 113 with it primarily sui generis rather than looking for sources and analogues of what it attempts. It is important to face the questions of the form and content of the work. One place to start is the hardy as- sumption that Donne was writing satire in the Metempsychosis. If he was (but the matter requires demonstration), then he can be taken to task for not making his satiric object clear or for dragging in unsuitable epic conventions. The epic conventions are there: formal announcement of subject, invocation of Destiny, catalogs and similes, diction, and stanza form. I think it is time to retrace our steps and search in the history of epic for a possible clue to what Donne was doing in his poem. Another point of departure is the implicit suggestion in recent criticism that we already under- stand sufficiently what the Metempsychosis is about. I shall show subsequently that this notion is unfounded by discussing some hitherto unknown and unsuspected source materials for the poem. As the fore- going survey of the critical history of the Metempsychosis has made clear, the only way for me to argue that the fragment is not so bad as it is said to be is to maintain that Donne did not write the poem which the most recent critics describe. For the operative factors in understanding and esteeming a Renaissance poem in our day are, on the one hand, considerations of literary form, which involve the determin- ation of poetic genre and the decorum established by the models for it, and, on the other, considerations of materials, the extrapoetic content on which the poet draws for his themes and perhaps his point of view. II I shall take up in this section the ques- tion of the poetic genre of Donne's Metem- psychosis, not because I attribute to it any temporal priority in the process of com- position, but because the grand and solemn opening movement of the fragment makes the question of its nature as epic one of the first to arise. But before turning to this question, I should explain why I exclude the poem from consideration as a satire. By this I mean only that the Metempsycho- sis is not fundamentally and generically a satire, verse written for the purpose of attacking or exposing vice to the end of reforming or deterring it. No one would, of course, deny that there are incidental gibes in the poem, at court life especially, but these are confined to the whale and ele- phant-and-mouse episodes (301-400). In the first place, it seems to me that the unsuccess to date in identifying or at least agreeing on the larger object or objects of Donne's presumed satire ought to cause us to put the satirical hypothesis on the shelf. It has been unproductive. It has also put Donne in a perhaps unnecessarily bad light as a poet. In the second place, the prosodic, thematic, and tonal differences between the Metempsychosis and Donne's undoubted five satires have been almost entirely lost to view. The Metempsychosis confronts the scholar and critic with a number of distinc- tive characteristics-a rapid and continu- ous narrative sequence, a commitment to myth, the dominant themes of change and gradation into evil rather than achieved and assailable vice, a strong narrative presence which is subject to wide variations of tone and mood, and a full-blown epic framework. None of these can be matched, except intermittently, by Donne's satires. It is possible to find in a quarter other than satire (or mock epic) a precedent for many aspects of the Metempsychosis, a precedent which fits with more general cir- cumstances of literary history in the Eng- lish Renaissance as well as the date of the poem and its place in Donne's career. I refer to the Metamorphoses of Ovid. I wish to declare at the outset, however, that in suggesting that the Metempsychosis can</page><page sequence="6">114 JANEL M. MUELLER profitably be viewed in the light of the Metamorphoses, I am not undertaking to establish Donne's indebtedness to Ovid in any specific point. An argument of this strength has only the most limited advan- tages, anyhow, in discussing the Ovidianism of the major poets of the age-most con- spicuously Spenser and Milton lS-who found much that was useful to them in Ovid's epic, and yet produced works that are anything but imitative or simply derivative. The form and conventions of Ovidian poetic narrative constituted a genre of unusual adaptability in the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries; this fact, I think, goes far toward accounting for its phenomenal popularity among the quite diverse poets of the period. No one will doubt the initial possibility that the Metempsychosis could bear some relation to the Metamorphoses, given what we know of Ovid's omnipresence in the Renaissance as a textbook for the funda- mentals of Latin verse composition and mythological lore'6 and what has recently been shown of the pervasive Ovidianism of Donne's love poetry.'7 Nor is it prima facie implausible that Donne in 1601 should be attracted to the mode of Ovidian poetic narrative, indeed, possibly for rea- sons similar to those of Ovid himself. The many Donne critics with biographical interests would find little to fault in E. K. Rand's description of the continuity be- tween Ovid's earlier amatory verse in the elegiac mode and the epic form and subject of the Metamorphoses, if the description were applied to their own subject: The spirit of metamorphosis.. . was in- grained in his nature. He relished nothing better than to set forth a mood or a situation with utter seriousness and then blithely to present the exact opposite. Shifts, setbacks, disappointments, metamorphoses, are the essence of life in his world of amorous adven- ture. It is also a little world of myth, with Corinna at its centre. Ovid had hugely enjoyed the role of creator; he is at once properly sceptical of poets' lies and confident of his own power to turn the chaos of brute fact into the cosmos of poetic reality. He had come to his own in an epic on meta- morphosis.18 For Donne there were additional overtones to what evolved as the Ovidian mode. It was viewed as an appropriate manner for an aspirant to a career in poetry who sought to develop his powers; its prac- titioners were young Inns of Court or university men with conscious aristocratic and witty pretensions. Moreover, the frank naturalism and presentation of passion as physical appetite in Ovidian parrative poetry, often with a female figure in the role of wooer, were used as an antidote to the idealizing treatment of women re- quired by the sonnet sequences.19 For young worldly poets, an Ovidian narrative could serve as a tonic, a sort of self- administered remedia amoris. But the objection will arise that Donne's Metempsychosis is very unlike Hero and Leander, Venus and Adonis, and most of the other Elizabethan and Jacobean my- thological-erotic narrative poems. The beautiful, mainly naked and recumbent bodies and sensuous transports of deities, youths, and maidens are absent from 15 See Douglas Bush, Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition in English Poetry, rev. ed.

So are the luxuriant settings, leisurely doings, and rhetorically extrava- gant debates for and against physical union. These are, in fact, all the accoutrements that Carew had in mind in his "Elegie on Dr. Donne" when he attributed to this poet's ascendancy in verse the exile of "the goodly .. . traine / Of gods and goddesses" and "The silenc'd tales o' th' Metamor- phoses." 20 The objection can, however, be turned around. Hero and Leander, Venus and Adonis, and the rest are themselves very unlike Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the work is taken in its entirety. The other Elizabethan and Jacobean poems are vari- ations and elaborations on single episodes from the Metamorphoses (or other adapt- able sources), executed in slow motion and at close range so as to magnify the pretti- ness, languor, and verbal display far beyond the measures which Ovid set himself. Fortunately, because of the anomalous character of the Metempsychosis, there is no need to enter here upon the disputed theory and history of the so-called epyllion, or mythological-erotic narrative poem, and the always central and always problematic position of the Metamorphoses within the genre.21 For Donne appears to have taken the rare expedient (also found in the Faerie Queene and Marini's L'Adone) of evolving an epic design that reflected the larger contours and substance of Ovid's epic. I shall try to show what that design is. In the opening lines of the Metamor- phoses Ovid announces his intention of rehearsing the changes of bodies to new forms, from the beginning of the world through human history down to his own time. (In Allen's and Milgate's terms, this is an unworkable subject. Yet Ovid's pro- ject was completed.) The poet invokes the gods to whom the changes are due to inspire his "continuous song":22 In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora; di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas) adspirate meis primaque ab origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen. [Metamorphoses 1. 1-4] Similarly, embarking on an epic "dedicated to Infinity" (Infinitate Sacrum), Donne contracts to "sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule/Whom Fate... placed in most shapes" (Metempsychosis 1-3) from its embodiment in an apple on the Forbidden Tree to its sovereign manifesta- tion "here amongst us now" (61). As Ovid develops his epic subject of metamorphosis through fifteen books, it acquires a definite set of philosophical and emotional connotations which for a recent sympathetic critic constitute the under- lying unity of the epic. Remarking on the integration of "the spirit and structure of the poem," D. A. Slater describes how Ovid's "spirit was influenced by the Pythagorean doctrine of the kinship of all living creatures, while the vast structure is harmonious through all its parts because it is dominated by a single idea-'the inter- change and interplay of all life in the world.' "23 The philosophical aspects of metamorphosis are treated by Ovid primar- ily in extended sections of the first and fifteenth books, and these are also the 20 For a text of the elegy, see Grierson (n. 4 above), 1:378- 80. 21 See Carl N.

MUELLER sections to which Donne's fragment bears the greatest affinity.24 In the opening sequence of book 1 (5-451), Ovid narrates the momentous series of primordial events from the creation of the cosmos and of man, through the four ages of the world and the race of the giants, to man's primal sin (Lycaon's rebellion against the gods and his murderous blood lust), up to the sending of the retributory Flood. Ovid depicts causation in both natural and human events as a relentless fatality (con- ceived both as physical necessity and unavertable consequences) which manifests itself in a ceaseless play of energy on bodies in time and place. Sometimes this fatality, this state of things that cannot be other- wise than it is, shows itself as benign-the god, or kindlier Nature, that composed the strife from which the world emerged (1. 21)-but oftener the process seems to lead downward. Ovid reverses in the Metamorphoses (1. 89-150) the optimistic construction he had placed on the four ages of the world in the Fasti. Likewise the long speech of Ovid's Pythagoras to Numa in book 15 (75-478) spells out the doctrine of the transmigration of souls and the ceaseless change that rules life in terms of single revolutions of a cycle, from rise to fall. This is the pattern of the life of men and of civilizations (at least what can be known about them), although physical nature, and the river of time by which it is imaged, carry suggestions of renewal for Ovid's Pythagoras as well as flux. Revert- ing to historical considerations, he stresses the falling away of men from the har- monious simplicity of the golden age into a life of rapine and violence that differs little from that of the savage beasts.25 Ovid's Pythagoras cries out in a series of showy antitheses against the crime of flesh stored away in flesh, one greedy body fattening upon another, one creature living by another creature's death: heu quantum scelus est in viscera viscera condi congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto. [15. 88-90] In rising tones he apostrophizes sheep and oxen, asking them how they that serve humans deserve slaughter: quid meruistis oves, placidum pecus inque tuendos natum homines, pleno quae fertis in ubere nectar, mollia quae nobis vestras velamina lanas praebetis vetaque magis quam morte iuvatis ? quid meruere boves, animal sine fraude dolisque, innocuum, simplex, natum tolerare labores? [15. 116-21] And he evokes by contrast the earlier time when plants only served for food, and birds and the hare and fish were safe from snares and nets (96-103). Donne, in his narrative of the soul's dwelling in fish, twice uses antithesis to dramatize the devouring of one by another 24 One other section of Ovid's epic, the song of Orpheus in book 10 (148-739), evidently exercised a fascination for Donne. He parallels broadly the famous lines on cultural relativism and libertine naturalism from Mirrha's soliloquy in defense of incest (321-35) in stanzas 20-21 and 52 of the Metempsychosis; the use of Mirrha's sentiments in the elegy "Change" and in "Confined Love" is of course well known. On libertinism generally in Ovidian poems, see Bush, Mlythol- ogy and the Renaissance Tradition, pp. 132, 133, 165. Orpheus's song is, moreover, one of the most tonally heightened in the entire epic and may have caught Donne's attention for this reason. But, above all, it is difficult to imagine that Donne, with his taste for paradox, was unresponsive to the fact that Orpheus's song, which held the beasts spellbound with its harmony, contained the incidents of most extreme and un- natural lust, incidents so terrible that when the bard had con- cluded, the Maenads tore him to pieces for his impiety (9. 1-66). The poet of the Metempsychosis might have seen some- thing of himself in Ovid's Orpheus. 25 Ovid scholars are agreed only that Pythagoras's speech is eclectic in its use of sources. The echo of book 5 of De rerum natura at 1. 145 ff. is universally acknowledged. The overall cast of the speech is, however, less Epicurean than Stoic, with an admixture of Aristotelian terminology. The point of view and style are at a level with the sublime opening section of the epic, on the creation and antedeluvian stages of history.

Beginning with the exclamation, "Is any kinde subject to rape like fish?/Ill unto man, they neither doe, nor wish," he prolongs the notes of Ovid's Pythagoras through an entire stanza (281-90). But, I remind myself and the reader, precise parallels need not be sought or insisted on. What is significant is the continuing consonance of the two poets in treating their very similar themes of metamorphosis and metem- psychosis. Beyond his two principal passages of philosophical reflection, Ovid keeps in steady focus through his fifteen books the world of oppositions and conflicts which effect eternal transformation. He portrays the vulnerability of individual identity in an encounter with a superior nature mostly on what are said to be erotic terms but are seen and shown as little more than Lucretian collisions of bodies in motion. In representing amor as violent physical appetite, Ovid makes repeated use of detailed and graphic process description,27 which often conveys a sense of defeat as the lesser being submits to the greater and undergoes loss or change of form. Donne's evocation of the growth of the mandrake (121-60) is of this sort, as is the sequence-- replete with ironic inversion-on the spawning, growth, and destruction of the whale (301-60). An additional Ovidian correspondence occurs in the whale sequence. Ovid characteristically presents water as a highly dangerous and exposed situation. The vividness of his narratives of pursuits and captures in pools and waves caught the fancy and inspired the emulation of Renaissance Ovidians: Lodge on the fate of Scylla (898-968), a later poet on Salmacis and Hermaphroditus (4. 285- 388), and a whole cluster of treatments of Narcissus's fatal self-enamorment.28 Even Marlowe, one of the most original prac- titioners of the genre, has his celebrated sequence in which the love-struck Neptune detains Leander in the Hellespont. Water settings are especially noteworthy in Ovid because they are departures from his general conception (also taken over by Renaissance Ovidians) that Nature is an anthropomorphic presence, sympathetic to the human plight, as shown in drooping flowers, moaning winds, and weeping fountains. Donne, of course, has no place for the pretty side of Ovidianism; he concurs instead in the exclamatory style and tonal shifts of Ovid's storytellers, soliloquizers, and commentary figures in order to vary and develop the one voice of the Metempsychosis, the poet's own. But while Ovid has many personages and voices and Donne has simply the soul and his narrative voice, the range and intensity of tone in the Metamorphoses and the Metempsychosis are central to the particular conception and effects of epic, and indeed to the regard in which the two works are held. Although there is less of Donne than there is of Ovid in this vein, it is hard to say which poet has been more attacked for his obtrusive and shifting ton- alities, the personal epic style. Again, is it possible to borrow from L. P. Wilkinson's 26 For the history of this topos, see W. Parsons, "'Lest Men Like Fishes ...,' " Traditio 3 (1945): 382. 27 See Wilkinson, pp. 160-69, and Wilmon Brewer, Ovid's "Metamorphoses" in European Culture (Boston, 1933), 1:17, who contrasts Ovid with such predecessors as Nicander: "While telling of a metamorphosis, the Alexandrians were apt to make prominent the divine being who caused the miracle. Ovid preferred to keep the god in the background, often allowing his action to be merely implied. Thus he tended to magnify the reader's amazement at the transformation and concentrate his attention on the event itself." Among the most notable process descriptions are those of Io (1. 635-71, 737- 46), the nymph who becomes a bear (2. 477-95), Atlas (4. 657-62), and Mirrha (10. 489-514). The cosmic workings and inexorability of fate are of course everywhere, but see especi- ally the connection with Themis (1. 320-23; 7. 392; 9. 403, 419) and the sway of fate even over the will of Jupiter (9. 428-38), which determines the calamitous course of history (15. 780-815). 28 These poems, along with a sampling of others in the Ovidian mode, are collected in Elizabethan Minor Epics, ed. Elizabeth Story Donno (London, 1963) and Elizabethan Narrative Verse, ed. Nigel Alexander (London, 1967).</page><page sequence="10">118 JANEL M. MUELLER spirited defense of Ovid certain terms and insights which apply easily to Donne. Wilkinson approaches the Metamorphoses as a "baroque" work, disposing of anachronism by defining "baroque" as postclassical extravagance, whatever the era in which it develops. Its province is the grandiose, the arresting, the theatrical; "full of restless and exuberant vitality, it strives after variety, strangeness and contrast-now fantastical, now playful, now picturesque. Indifferent to truth, the baroque claims the right to exaggerate or deceive for artistic ends." Wilkinson's categorization of the Metamorphoses as "'baroque' in conception, with its huge extent of ceaseless movement,... its variety, its fantasy, its conceits and shocks, its penchant for the grotesque and its blend of humour and grandiosity" can be extended to the much smaller fragment of the Metempsychosis, as can his explanation of how such variety results. Ovid's method is to take myth, "the traditional story and 'play it straight,' to imagine what would, as a matter of fact, have happened in the circumstances.... Let us go ahead and see what happens, he seems to say. Some parts will prove pathetic, some grotesque, some stark, some comic-in fact, a great deal of the essential variety of tone will result automatically." 29 In remarking the range of tone and mood produced by Ovid's direct depiction of metamorphosis, it is equally important to perceive that he does not reach to moralizing. The emotionalism of his epic may have been part of what prompted moralizing in others, and in fact the books of the Metamorphoses abound in cases that look at least like poetic justice-- Lycaon's transformation into a wolf, for example-if not justice of a higher kind. But on closer inspection we see that all Ovid is revealing is continuity of natures, a vestige of the etiological intent in which the literature of metamorphosis had its beginning. Ovid deals in questions of fatality, of physical and causal necessity, not questions of right and wrong. These became the extensive precinct of the Ovide moralisd. To grasp the point afresh, one need only reread the Circe episode in the Metamorphoses (14. 248-307), which be- came such a central allegory for the sinking of human nature into bestiality through carnal indulgence and vice (see Milton's Comus). In Ovid, the experience with Circe is merely a travelers' mischance, though one of the more desperate ones. By the time Donne wrote, of course, it was im- possible to regain an Ovidian literalness of vision, and the subhuman forms which his soul incarnates and imbrutes are redolent of most varieties of lust. I turn now from philosophical and emotional attitudes and their poetic expres- sion in Ovid's treatment of his epic subject to focus on the avowed historical objective of the Metamorphoses, which does so much to determine the progression and scope of the epic. Ovid set himself to chronicle all the changes of form that had occurred in the realm of gods and men from the creation of the world on through Greek and Roman history to the reign of Caesar Augustus. The enormous stretch of ma- terial was chosen by Ovid as part of the epic strategy which he was deliberately devising as a challenge to Virgil.30 The outcome was, of course, well known and well regarded in European literature of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Ovid created his irresistible surge of rapid and animated narrative whose forward move- ment lay not in a single line of action but in the almost breathless serialism of a multitude of episodes, rich in concrete particulars, names and places, and as- sembled through sudden shifts in setting 29 Ovid Recalled, pp. 156, 159. 30 See Otis (n. 18 above), pp. 94-104, 286-305.</page><page sequence="11">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 119 and action as well as interpolated tales. As scholars of the English Renaissance have pointed out,31 the Ovidian epic mode was recognized by poets as an available alternative to what might be called the Aristotelian model-the description of epic plot as a unity of action in the form of a single hero's exploits. Sir John Haring- ton's "Apologie" prefaced to his transla- tion of Orlando Furioso (1591) stressed the right of later poets to differ from the epic practice of Homer, and if there had been an E. K. for the Faerie Queene, his recom- mendation, no doubt, would have taken the same lines. Partly because it allowed Renaissance poets to continue in the vein of medieval chronicle and romance and still to invoke classical precedent, Ovidian epic became the standard form for the historical and topographical subjects which appealed to the nationalistic fervor of the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. English productions include William Warner's Albion's England (1586, etc.), which began at the father of Saturn; Thomas Heywood's Troia Britanica, or Great Britaines Troy (1609), embracing the time from the Creation to the fall of Troy in 13,000 ottava rima lines; Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (1612-22), praised by William Browne of Tavistock as the work of "our second Ovid"; and Browne's own Britannia's Pastorals (1613-16).32 Certainly there are immeasurable the- matic and tonal differences between Donne's Metempsychosis and the above- mentioned Ovidian epics on a comprehen- sive historical plan, but there are also several common elements-the amplitude of subject matter, the serial structure, and even the pastoral setting. Ovidian poetic narrative, whether applied to erotic or historical materials, acquired a stable asso- ciation with pastoral poetry-one among several genres with which this fluid mode combined. In this perspective the Edenic location of Donne's epic which purports to begin with the beginning (though he does not linger there) is not hard to account for.33 Indeed, there is an equally plausible analogue in the opening section of the Metamorphoses. Although this section is composed entirely of elements of pagan philosophy and differs in a number of respects from Genesis, Ovid's narrative of the beginning proved so eminently satis- factory to Christian minds that it prompted the vast enterprise of allegorizing all fifteen books. This enterprise had been flourishing since the Middle Ages and continued unabated in Donne's time.34 Near-contemporary testimony to this re- gard for Ovid's account of creation is provided in Arthur Golding's "Epistle to Leicester," prefixed to his translation of the Metamorphoses (1567). Golding, who was unique as an allegorizer only in sub- stituting a set of self-help principles and leading examples for a mass of finished glosses, is driven by Protestant zeal to dilate on the numerous consonances between Ovid and Genesis: "What man is he but would suppose the author of this booke/The first foundation of his woorke from Moyses wryghtings tooke ?"35 The 31 Lewis F. Ball, "The Background of the Minor English Renaissance Epics," ELH 1 (1934): 63-89; Bush, Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition, p. 76. 32 Bush, Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition, pp. 65-67, 174-78, 193-95. 33 It is always assumed, from "The Baite," that Donne scorned pastoral taken straight. But "The Extasie," which only he could have written, looks among other things like his version of Ovidian erotic narrative. He answers to the genre in his setting, his detailed placing of the lovers in the landscape, in the long and ingenious speech inviting to love, and in the implied consummation. But, characteristically, there is no mythology, and a "dialogue of one" replaces actual debate. On the poem's influence, see George Williamson, "The Convention of 'The Extasie,'" in Seventeenth-Century Con- texts (Chicago, 1961). 34 See L. K. Born, "Ovid and Allegory," Speculum 9 (1934): 362-79; C. de Boer, Ovide moralist, poeme du com- mencement du 14e siecle and Ovide moralis en prose, texte du 15e si&amp;cle (Amsterdam, 1915-38); J. Engels, Etudes sur I'Ovide moralisi (Groningen, 1945); and D. P. Harding, Milton and the Renaissance Ovid (Urbana, Ill., 1946). The earliest effort at allegorizing Ovid seems to have been (pseudo-)Lactantius's commentary, which was printed in Pub. Ovidii Nasonis Sulmonensis poetae loperum (Frankfort, 1601). 35 "Epistle to Leicester," lines 342-43, in Shakespeare's Ovid, Being Arthur Golding's Translation of the "Metamor- phoses," ed. W. H. D.

MUELLER telling difference between the historical undertakings proposed in Ovid's Meta- morphoses and in Donne's Metempsychosis is not, therefore, one of substance but of ultimate direction. Donne's aim, if we can believe Jonson, was denigratory, though we cannot be sure how it would have been worked out. Ovid's aim was celebratory, and a long account of the deification of Julius Caesar-changed to a flaming star-- climaxes his last book (Metamorphoses, 15. 745-870). In the historical scope and epic structure of the Metamorphoses Ovid advanced large claims for himself and acted accord- ingly (see the sections on the line of Theseus, the travels of the Argonauts, the Trojan War, and the history of Italy down to the founding of Rome), but it is only very recently that his work has been acknowledged to have any form whatever, especially as a history.36 Under the older and still dominant view, Ovid is much to blame for his unemphatic chronology and for not putting it to more use in structural articulation. He too has been accused of fundamental unseriousness of purpose in announcing the course of world history, especially Greek and Roman, as his subject and then using it as a continual pretext to tell fascinating stories of how gods and men were compelled to assume new forms. While most readers have found the stories to be of primary interest, and no one would rank Ovid very highly as a historian, it is impossible to dismiss his claim to be surveying human history. He returns again and again to the business of correlating and interweaving his historical threads in the fifteen books of the Metamorphoses. Charges as to the formlessness of Donne's Metempsychosis seem to be of the same sort, but they have far less to go on and rely on generalizations from the fragment. It is, moreover, significant that the histories used by Donne in the Metempsychosis, the Libri antiquitatum of pseudo-Philo, the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus, and the compilations of Annius of Viterbo, have a shared though more ambitious narrative plan. These works purport variously to coordinate legends of the Jews with those of Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and Rome from the Creation to some distant terminus such as the death of Judas Maccabeus.37 Viewed within an available epic context of this sort, Donne cannot, I think, be held deficient in his sense of form. It is possible, of course, to raise the objection that he nowhere declares his poetic inten- tions in the Metempsychosis, but there are still many features of the poem that bear out my references to the broader context of Ovidian epic. Allen remarked that Donne had geared his rhetoric to a long haul by reliance on descriptio and translatio, open figures of speech, and conjectured, despite Donne's peculiar tonality, that his model was the Faerie Queene.38 Williamson, too, insisted on the Spenserian reminiscences of Donne's stanza form.39 Donne's stanza is comprised of nine lines of pentameter and a final alexandrine rhymed aabccbbddD. It is an anomalous form and not really very similar either to Spenser's ababbcbcC or to ottava rima (abababcc or ababccdd) except in its blocklike units, measured progression, and broad flow. What sets Donne's stanza off from Spenser's and Figures, ed. Karl K. Hulley and Stanley T. Vandersall [Lincoln, Neb., 1970], p. 58). 36 Walther Ludwig, Struktur und Einheit der "Metamor- phosen" Ovids (Berlin, 1965), sees a progression from Urzeit to mythische Zeit to historische Zeit in the epic, and places sub- stantial weight on Ovid's genealogies and parallel chronology. Otis, taking a more moderately revised view, sees the plan of the Metamorphoses as an attempt to combine two antithetical bodies of material-the amatory and the Roman-Augustan historical-in an emergent formal structure which makes its effect principally in the order and succession of episodes (Ovid as an Epic Poet, pp. 306-15). 37 On Donne's use of these works, see the editions of Grierson, 2:224, and Milgate, pp. 173, 174, 187, 190.

They are Ovid's in the Metamorphoses and, in much nearer view, those of Marlowe's couplets in Hero and Leander, as well as the verses of all those successive poets who could not resist such effects.41 Moreover, a subtitle may attest to authorial consciousness if not elucidate, and Donne has a subtitle: Metempsychosis: Po6ma Satyricon. As luck would have it, satyricon is a difficult term. It is most familiar as Petronius's title, and the latest determination in that quarter deserves attention here. P. G. Walsh points out the cleverness and ambivalence of Petronius's title, which denotes in the first place the derivation of the work from the tradition of Greek comic fiction: As an episodic narrative of comic adventure within the Greek tradition it bears the Greek title ",ZervpCKCV libri," "a story of lascivious behaviour." The Greek word bears the additional sense of "derisive," and the adjec- tive is so aptly descriptive of the book that Petronius may well have intended this additional overtone. Then there is a punning pointer toward Roman satire. True, the adjective satiricus is not found in extant Latin before the fourth century, and the Greek and Latin words are unconnected. But the philological distinction is not in question; rather, would the title Satyricon have im- mediately registered in a Roman ear the association with satura? There can be little doubt that it would. Petronius intended his title to convey to the alert reader that his book was a derisive account of lascivious behaviour, infused with satirical elements.42 With epic and erotic-comic connotations in the forefront, and satirical connotations as an undercurrent, we can return for a last time to Donne's Metempsychosis in the context of Ovidian poetic narrative. Douglas Bush observes, as a mark of decadence, that in the Ovidian mode "after about 1600 there is an obviously growing taste for humor or satire," which he links with "the realistic tendencies, especially conspicuous in the drama, that marked the turn of the century." 43 Certainly a contemporary association of satire and Ovidian poetic narrative is reflected in the order for confiscation and burning issued by Archbishop Whitgift and Bishop Bancroft on June 1, 1599.44 One of the poems ordered seized was John Marston's Metamorphosis of Pygmalion's Image (1598), which confusedly and con- fusingly attempts to bring lasciviousness to a reductio ad absurdum by means of a plot that implausibly grants the hero his desire. John Weever acknowledged the connection (and the order) differently in a suave piece of etiology entitled Faunus and Melliflora, or, The Origin of Our English Satyres (1600), which represented the appearance of satyrs (satires) in the world as the result of Diana's vengeance on Melliflora's broken vow of chastity by metamorphosing Melliflora's infant son. 40 R. M. Alden, English Verse (New York, 1903), pp. 108- 12, characterizes complex lyrical measures of ten lines or more as a feature of French influence in England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But in the exhaustive study by J. Schipper, Englische Metrik (Bonn, 1888), there is no pattern really resembling Donne's until Swinburne devised the meter of "A Birth-Song" (see Schipper, 2:2, 694). Nor have I found closer analogues in histories of French, Italian, or Spanish prosody. 41 With all respect to Golding's fourteeners, it is generally agreed that the best meter for rendering the Metamorphoses into English is pentameter couplets. See the admirable trans- lation by A. E. Watts (Berkeley, Calif., 1954). 42 P. G. Walsh, The Roman Novel: The "Satyricon" of Petronius and the "Metamorphoses" of Apuleius (Cambridge, 1970), p. 72. Walsh's note supplies analogous Greek titles having historical and epic connotations as well as philo- logical sources for the debate whether satyricon is a Greek genitive plural or a neuter singular. 43 Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition, p. 164. 44 For the text of this little understood order, see Edward Arber, ed., A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers ofLondon, 1554-1640 (London, 1875-94), 3:677-78.</page><page sequence="14">122 JANEL M. MUELLER The suggestion in Weever, and more than suggestion in Marston, that the intoler- ability of lust had become a dominant motif in end-of-century English poetry is significant but baffling. It somehow relates to Donne's Metempsychosis, and to Hamlet, but one hardly knows how to be more specific. At any rate, the repugnance was shortlived as a literary factor, for Salmacis and Hermaphroditus (1602) illustrates how little the combination of Ovidianism and satire would conventionally come to. The poet mingles a teasing eroticism, broken off repeatedly by new strands of narrative, with such fitful sallies as this description of Jove's arrival at Astraea's court: But there was such a busie rout before, Some serving men, and some promooters bee, That he could passe no foote without a fee; But as he goes, he reaches out his hands, And payes each one in order as he stands; And still, as he was paying those before, Some slipt againe betwixt him and the dore.45 This passage echoes Donne only in the object of disdain, for the treatment in Salmacis and Hermaphroditus is only modish and ultimately complacent. But other writers in the period of the Metem- psychosis were sounding deeper and more Donnean notes. George Chapman's two productions, Skia Nuktos, or The Shadow of Night (1594), which sought to employ significant obscurity in the service of philosophical skepticism, and Ovid's Ban- quet of Sense (1595), a wholesale inversion of the Platonic and neo-Platonic ladder of love that works itself out in its own terms without authorial intrusion, reflect very nearly on Donne's epic venture.46 So, too, in a different way does Cyril Tourneur's The Transformed Metamorphosis (1600). This work also trades in obscurity and indirection and draws on the epic con- ventions of a descent to the underworld and a heroic combat (replete with sexual antagonism) between the Hyenna and the knight Mavortio in order to convey an utter contemptus mundi and the necessity of nothing less than transformation of its evil and debased nature if the world is to be redeemed. Tourneur lards his poem with a great deal of Spenserianism, and indeed it may have been called forth by the death of Spenser.47 However that may be, Spenser himself was brooding on the supreme sway of change and decay in the world and moving toward transcendent desires ("that Sabaoths sight") in the Mutabilitie Cantos (published 1609), which he left unfinished at his death in 1599. All of these poems may be regarded as out- reachings from Ovidian epic, and as such they help to establish the poetic form and context in which Donne's Metempsychosis is to be evaluated and interpreted. III Because of the supposition that the Metempsychosis is a satire, or the fact that it is a difficult poem, sources have been an enduring matter of interest. In his useful but specialized discussion of the work from the viewpoint of art history and iconog- raphy, H. W. Janson assessed its reputa- tion and the reasons for it as follows: "The author's command of his wealth of esoteric learning is such that only a minor portion of his sources has been uncovered so far. A fuller study would undoubtedly lead to a revision of the generally un- favourable judgement pronounced upon The Progresse by students of Elizabethan poetry. Even as a fragment devoted almost entirely to the pre-human dwelling-places of the Soule, the poem must be acknowl- edged as one of Donne's most ambitious 45 Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, lines 168-74, in Donno, p. 285, and in Alexander, p. 172. 46 See J.

His claim is to "have no purpose to come into any mans debt," which he then partially retracts: "Yet, if I doe borrow any thing of Antiquitie, besides that I make account that I pay it to posterity, with as much and as good: you shall still find me to acknowledge it." However, there is at most one such acknowledgment in the Metempsychosis, the reference to the "guesse" of "devout and sharpe men" (72) that Christ's cross and the Tree of Knowledge stood in the same place. The only real clue in searching for Donne's sources has been the admoni- tion in the prefatory letter: "All which I will bid you remember, (for I would have no such Readers as I can teach) is, that the Pithagorian doctrine doth not onely carry one soule from man to man, nor man to beast, but indifferently to plants also."49 But research (mainly Allen's) into con- ceptions and traditions about Pythagoras which were available to Donne has not been very helpful. There is, of course, the perennial problem of the lack of written material and even of a close to con- temporary account of the doctrines of a sage who generated a secret and loyal group of followers. But there is also the problem of correlating the diverse mass of testimony and rumor that accumulated around the shadowy master. And finally there is the problem of relating what Pythagoras may possibly have taught about metempsychosis to the use of the notion by Donne. In all of the tradition about Pythagoras, in fact, Ovid's portrayal comes closest to being a source for the Metempsychosis, and even here the parallels are more those of tone and perspective- the sense that Destiny is supreme and that the world has fallen off from an earlier innocence and happiness-than of philo- sophical substance. But if Donne's admonition is given full force, it is possible to find his description of metempsychosis more helpful than it has actually proved to date. For it is hard to imagine why Donne was so emphatic about the passing of souls "not onely... from man to man, nor man to beast, but indifferently to plants also" unless it was to indicate that he was deviating from the standard conception of Pythagorean metempsychosis as derived from the dialogues of Plato.50 Plato makes no allowance for souls passing from men and beasts into plants. I began to inquire what kind of Pythagoreanism, exclusive of Plato, might have been known to Donne. I found a body of material that unquestion- ably served Donne in the Metempsychosis. While I am not prepared to argue, except in two cases, the question of Donne's immediate sources, I can show whence the basic themes of the poem ultimately derive. I begin, because Donne appears to have begun, with Tertullian's De anima, the fullest analytical account of theories of the soul available to him. Tertullian had nothing but scorn for theories of trans- migration, but his discussion is charac- terized by careful detail and precise terminology. He uses "metempsychosis" only with reference to the teachings of Pythagoras and of a certain Carpocrates, whose ideas he classifies as a development of Pythagoreanism. In this terminology Tertullian is unique, and Donne's usage conforms to his exactly. According to Tertullian, Carpocrates .. .,who was... a fornicator ... asserted that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the overthrow by all means 48 H. W.

The transmigration (metempsychosin) of human souls therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable (nec- essarie), whenever any depravity whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life's passage. Evil deeds... appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence,... thrust out from time to time into the prison of the body.51 Other writers from the early Christian period, church fathers with one exception, relate the little else known about Carpoc- rates. All of them, however, differ from Tertullian in treating Carpocrates not as a Pythagorean but as one of the vilest and most extreme exponents of the heretical strain of early Christianity known as Gnosticism. The identifying feature of Carpocrates' teaching was the advocacy of total immoralism as part of a world view which I shall outline presently. He and his followers also had a reputation for living by what they taught; the church fathers reprehend them in particular for their promiscuity. The basic features of Carpo- crateanism receive their earliest and most incisive account in Irenaeus's On the Detection and Refutation of Gnosis Falsely So-called (ca. 180), often referred to as Against Heresies. Irenaeus was working from a lost work of Justin Martyr; Tertullian, like all subsequent writers, got his information from Irenaeus. Irenaeus identifies Carpocrates as an Alexandrian, an Egyptian Greek, and implies a date for him in the mid-second century.52 While nearly every later account merely repeats or expands upon Irenaeus,53 there is another and independent source, not so much for Carpocrates as for Epiphanes, Carpocrates' son and a cultic figure in his own right. This source is Clement of Alexandria's Stromateis or Miscellanies, written after 160. In his third book, a work which might well have interested Donne in mid-1601 with its discussion of sexual relations and marriage, Clement, a native of Carpocrates' own city, gives excerpts from a book which Epiphanes wrote in his late teens. Its title, Concerning Righteousness, bespeaks a devastating irony which Epiphanes perhaps inherited from his father and which would not have been lost on Donne. Clement reports as follows: This is what he says, then, in his book Concerning Righteousness: "The righteous- ness of God is a kind of universal fairness and equality.... The light of the sun, which is the cause of the daytime and the father of light, God pours out from above upon the earth in equal measure on all who have power to see. For all see alike. There is no distinction between rich and poor, people and governor, stupid and clever, female and male, free men and slaves. Even the irrational animals are not accorded any different treatment; but in just the same way God pours out from above sunlight equally upon all the animals.... The sun causes food to grow for all living beings alike; the universal righteousness is given to all equally. In this respect there is no difference between the 51 De anima 35 (Migne, PL 2: 709-12); English version in The Writings of Quintius Sept. Flor. Tertullianus, trans. Peter Holmes, in Ante-Nicene Christian Library, ed.

Irenaeus's datable reference is to a certain early follower of Carpocrates, Marcellina, who came to Rome in the episcopate of Anicetus. While there is no such reference in Tertullian, Donne reveals a sense of the chronology of Carpocrateanism and its inception in the reign of Hadrian; see Metempsychosis 67-68: "this soule which oft did teare, / And mend the wracks of th'Empire, and late Rome." 53 See Hippolytus Philosophoumena 7. 20, in the mistitled Origenis Philosophumena (Oxford, 1851); Eusebius Historia ecclesiastica 4. 7 (PG 20: 317-20); Epiphanius Panarion (Adversus haereses) 27 (PG 41: 363-78); Theodoret Com- pendium haereticarum fabularum 1. 5 (PG 83: 349-52); Philastrius Liber de haeresibus (PL 12: 1151-52); Augustine De haereses 7 (PL 42: 27).</page><page sequence="17">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 125 entire species of oxen and any individual oxen, between the species of pigs and particular pigs, between the species of sheep and particular sheep, and so on with all the rest.... Furthermore all plants of whatever sort are sown equally in the earth. Common nourishment grows for all beasts which feed on the earth's produce; to all it is alike. It is regulated by no law.... "And for birth there is no written law (for otherwise it would have been transcribed). All beings beget and give birth alike, having received by God's righteousness an innate equality. The Creator and Father of all with his own righteousness appointed this.... He did not make a distinction between female and male, rational and irrational, nor between anything and anything else at all."54 Clement's hitherto calm tone, however, mounts to outrage as he copies out Epiphanes' cynical account of the origins of law and his particular inferences regard- ing sexual community: "As the laws (he says) could not punish men who were ignorant of them, they taught men that they were transgressors. But the laws, by presupposing the existence of private property, cut up and destroyed the universal equality decreed by the divine law." . . . He says that the idea of Mine and Thine came into existence through the laws so that the earth and money were no longer put to common use. And so also with marriage.... "God made all things for man to be common property. He brought female to be with male and in the same way united all animals. He thus showed righteousness to be a universal fairness and equality. But those who have been born in this way have denied the universality which is the corollary of their birth and say, 'Let him who has taken one woman keep her,' whereas all alike can have her, just as the other animals do." After this, which is quoted word for word, he again continues in the same spirit as follows: "With a view to the permanence of the race he has implanted in males a strong and ardent desire which neither law nor custom nor any other restraint is able to destroy. For it is God's decree." These, then, are the doctrines of the excellent Carpocratians. These, so they say, and certain other enthusiasts for the same wickednesses, gather together for feasts (I would not call their meeting an Agape), men and women together.... and they have intercourse where they will and with whom they will. After they have practised com- munity of use in this love-feast, they demand by daylight of whatever women they wish that they will be obedient to the law of Carpocrates-it would not be right to say the law of God. Such, I think, is the law that Carpocrates must have given for the copula- tions of dogs and pigs and goats.55 Here, in the views of Carpocrates and Epiphanes, is the nucleus of Donne's poem. Before I proceed to actual corre- spondences, it is well to say a final word about sources. There is no source for Epiphanes other than Clement, whom Donne could have known directly. In calculating the possibilities of Donne's knowledge of Clement there is no need to suppose that he read the original (Donne's Greek was always rudimentary). There were four editions of Hervetus's Greek- Latin Clement between 1556 and 1590. I am also persuaded that Donne drew on Tertullian, whose materials are not unique, but from whom Donne evidently got the "Pithagorian" association for Carpocrates as well as the title for his poem. There were no fewer than seventeen separate editions of Tertullian's works between 1521 and 1599.56 54 Clement of Alexandria Stromateis 3. 2 (PG 8: 1103-14); English version in Alexandrian Christianity, ed. and trans. J. E. L. Oulton and Henry Chadwick (London, 1954), 2: 42-43. 55 Ibid., 2:43-45. 56 Because Irenaeus's account of Carpocrateanism is the earliest, the most coherent, and the source for later writers (Tertullian makes merely a partial abstract of it), I use Irenaeus in the exposition of certain points in the following pages. It is worth remarking that Donne could easily have known Irenaeus's work, which was variously available in the sixteenth century (in Erasmus's much reprinted Latin trans- lation and in the editions of Gallasius, Grynaeus, and Feuardent); there were sixteen separate issuings between 1526 and 1596. Yet there is no textual confirmation of Donne's use ofIrenaeus.</page><page sequence="18">126 JANEL M. MUELLER To proceed, then, to the correspondences between the doctrines of Carpocrates and Epiphanes and Donne's Metempsychosis. The most sustained, of course, is the operation of metempsychosis "in all manner of forms whatever" (Carpocrates), made more graphic and debasing in the view of man as just another animal (Epiphanes). There is the evolving pre- sentation of the soul's reincarnations as an ever more conscious and consenting initiation into evil in all its manifestations. Near the end of the narrative Donne sums up in a witty variation on the basic Carpocratean premise: "... keeping some quality/Of every past shape, she knew treachery,/Rapine, deceit, and lust, and ills enow/To be a woman" (506-9). Donne also uses imagery taken over from the two sources: Epiphanes' impartial sun is invoked as the "eye of heaven" with a "male force" (11-12), and Carpocrates' metaphor of the prison of the body recurs several times: "This soule to whom Luther and Mahomet were/Prisons of flesh" (67-68); "... her firme destiny/Confin'd and enjayld her, that seemed so free,/Into a small blew shell" (176-78); and the small fish swallowed by the swan is "a prison in a prison put" (241). Most obviously, Carpocrates speaks out through the narrative voice in Donne's final stanza: "Ther's nothing simply good, nor ill alone,/Of every quality com- parison,/The onely measure is, and judge, opinion" (518-20). Likewise, Epiphanes' arguments are first put into action by the "hot cocke," and then directly stated: He asks her not, who did so tast, nor when, Nor if his sister, or his neece shee be; Nor doth she pule for his inconstancie If in her sight he change, nor doth refuse The next that calls; both liberty doe use; Where store is of both kindes, both kindes may freely chuse. Men, till they tooke laws which made freedome lesse, Their daughters, and their sisters did ingresse; Till now unlawful, therefore ill, 'twas not. [195-203] Upon ascertaining the thematic core of the Metempsychosis to be the doctrines of father and son, Carpocrates and Epiphanes, questions of interpretation can be allowed to enter. What attracted Donne in this strain of heretical Gnosticism? What did he use and not use from it? What can be concluded about the relation of his poem to its source material? While there are aspects of demonism, magic, and cultic practice which Donne ignored in Carpocrateanism,57 it is evident that he was attracted by the gnosis, or claim to special and saving knowledge, from which the term Gnosticism was derived and applied to a number of sects. Carpocrates and his followers, according to Irenaeus, insisted upon the name: "They style themselves Gnostics." The special and saving knowledge taught by Carpocrates was a world view that was absolute and all-embracing in its pessimism. (Indeed, Clement seems to imply that it was a form of Platonic idealism turned upside down, for he remarks that "the knowledge of the Monad... is the root- origin of the Carpocratians' heresy.")58 According to the account deriving from Irenaeus and transmitted by Tertullian and others, Carpocrates maintained that life in the flesh and the whole realm of nature were maliciously contrived by hostile ruling powers, whom he called archons, and whose intent was to confine and tor- ment the soul, the divine spark. The archons' will is the relentless fatality that binds everything and determines all that happens. Perhaps because of the explicit 57See Irenaeus, Writings, 1: 93-96, and Oulton and Chadwick, Alexandrian Christianity, 2: 24-26. 58 Alexandrian Christianity, 2:42.</page><page sequence="19">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 127 treatment of the body-soul relationship, the most perennial theme of Donne's work, the stark despair of this explanation of evil and change infuses the mythic universe of the Metempsychosis. While he does not link the operation of his Destiny with the "angels much inferior to the unbegotten Father" who made "the universe and its contents" in Carpocrates, Donne does imply a similar disjunction between a distant God and an immediate, other power who holds sway over nature. The poem makes constant reference to the workings of this power and its manifesta- tions, beginning with the announcement of the subject (and the irony of "progresse"): I sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule, Whom Fate, which God made, but doth not controule, Placed in most shapes.... [1-3] God in the Metempsychosis does not "controule" Fate, that is, regulate it, check it, call it to account, overmaster it (OED, s.v. "Control," 3, 4b, 5). Destiny is, in fact, "the Commissary of God,/That hast mark'd out a path and period/For every thing" (31-33). God has made it the commissioner in charge of the world, the superintendent of its operations (OED, s.v. "Commissary," 1). "Commissary," the cognate of a late Latin word, renders the Greek demiourgos almost exactly in its two senses of "administrator" and "crafts- man." The term became a Platonic (and sometimes Gnostic) denomination for the creator of the world. Donne does not go so far as assigning creative power to Destiny in the poem, although he does call it the "Knot of all causes" (35). If we cannot find an overtly Gnostic two-creator theory in the Metempsychosis,59 still the origins of the soul's life in the body are depicted with dark irony in a significantly general ascription of agency: "On that tree hung in security/This Soule, made by the Makers will from pulling free" (79-80). "Who sinn'd?" Donne asks a little later. "Yes, but who created ?" is the prior question. For the ineluctable necessity of evil in the poem binds all things in the ominous mystery of what Fate will inflict on the soul: "Fate . . bids her againe retire/T'another fish, to any new desire/ Made a new prey" (245-49). Not only is the fatality of all events and actions heavily stressed in the Metem- psychosis; there is also a constantly evoked sense of violent physical constraint, which attests the arbitrariness of the world-ruling power. "Destiny... did install" (25-26); "Her, her fate threw" (129); "Fate not affording bodies of more worth/For her as yet, bids her againe retire/T'another fish" (245-47); "Into an embrion fish, our Soule is throwne,/And in due time throwne out againe" (301-2). This presentation tallies exactly with Carpocrates' teachings as reported by Irenaeus: "No one leaves the power of those angels who made the world; souls are always made reincarnate until they have completed all sins." 60 The state of the soul in the body and the world, where it is constantly thrust into evil, is numbness, incapacity, and unawareness. Carpocrates says that the soul could become "vigorous and pure" by "annihilat- ing the passions which are attached to men and punish them," but he can instance only "the soul of Christ" as having achieved this end (although Irenaeus reports the claims of some Carpocrateans to have done so). Donne's imagination responded strongly to the conception that the body and its evil ambiance have the 59 For discussions of Gnostic doctrine and mythology, see Robert M.

MUELLER effect of overwhelming the soul's precious divine spark and bringing it to passivity and then to danger.61 Passive constructions are frequent in the poem. Donne also supplies a number of memorable images of the soul's predicament: the mandrake is "This living buried man," "A mouth but dumbe, he hath; blinde eyes, deafe eares" (151, 160); the small fish "Pace with her native streame.. . doth keepe" (251), but the seeming benignity of the natural element gives way only to illusion and deadly betrayal: ... safe the place she's come unto Where fresh, with salt waves meet, and what to doe She knowes not, but betweene both makes a boord or two. So far from hiding her guests, water is, That she showes them in bigger quantities Then they are. Thus doubtfull of her way, For game and not for hunger a sea Pie Spied through this traiterous spectacle, from high, The seely fish where it disputing lay, And t'end her doubts and her, beares her away. ... [268-77] However, it is Donne's description of the sparrow which takes the process one step further and demonstrates the con- tinuum between existing in the body and committing evil. The sparrow develops inexorably from infant innocence to harsh experience of physical growth and needs to a sudden coming of age in insatiable lustfulness. Donne's rhythms, diction, and syntax precisely render in turn the touch- ing gawkiness of the "raw armes" where "stiffe feathers now begin,/As childrens teeth through gummes, to breake with paine" and the abrupt facility of the same wings to become the instruments by which "this hot cocke, in bush and tree,/In field and tent, oreflutters his next hen" (182-83; 193-94). In all the starkness of this presentation of evil and change there was one aspect of Carpocrateanism that could be counted an advantage, at least theoreti- cally, by a troubled mind like Donne's. This was the obvious abrogation of the ortho- dox Christian notion of free will and its consequence, personal moral responsi- bility. One of the most revealing recogni- tions attendant on the discovery of sources is the extent to which Donne made the vision of the soul as a helpless and even compliant victim his own as he wrote the Metempsychosis. Yet Carpocrates did not merely main- tain the necessity of evil and mean by it that purity is all but impossible. His was the much bolder argument, given at length by Irenaeus,62 that the soul could assert and attain its own selfhood only by actively engaging in all kinds of evil: "actions such as it is not right for us to mention or to hear or even to have in mind, or to believe that any such thing is considered among men who live in the civilised world." In this way alone the soul could, so to speak, beat the archons at their own game. For by working at com- pleting its quota of earthly experience- that is, its sum of depravity-the soul could more quickly escape the body and terminate its lifespan. This is the core of Carpocrates' gnosis. But he adds a further assertion which is at once a paradox and a 61 On the foregoing notions of creation, fatality, and the powerlessness of the soul in Gnostic thought, see Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, pp. 42-44, 62-63, 241-65. As Jonas points out (p. 33), there are extensive correlations between Gnosti- cism and Jewish mystical thought at every stage of develop- ment. These hold in particular with the Hermetic writings so avidly read in the Renaissance, and especially the cosmo- gonical treatise Poimandres. It synthesizes an analogue of the Genesis creation story with repeated invocations of a very strong conception of Fate (heimarmenj, a term with prior usage in astrology and Stoic thought) and, with this, the workings of the Administrators of the world (dioiketeroi). These beings are distinct from the Creator of the world (dimiourgos), or Mind (nous). Also in the Poimandres life in the body is seen as a descent from a higher existence. Donne may well have known this work in the Latin translation of Ficino. See secs. 9-19 of the Poimandres in Hermetica, ed. and trans. Walter Scott (Oxford, 1924), 1:118-25; and Jonas's discussion of the treatise in the light of Gnosticism (The Gnostic Religion, pp. 147-73). 62 Irenaeus Adversus haereses 1. 25; Grant, Gnosticism. p. 37.</page><page sequence="21">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 129 powerful incentive to his world view. To Carpocrates moral notions are another contrivance of the archons, who intend thereby to confuse the soul and prevent it from understanding the truth. The truth is that nothing is either good or bad in itself but only in the opinion of it. In the Metempsychosis Donne appends this assertion in his last stanza, but he does not incorporate ethical relativism into the mythic universe of his plants and animals. As for immoralism, while Donne does show the soul acquiring more and more experience of evil and with this experience proficiency and awareness, he nowhere represents the soul as an immoralist by insight or persuasion as Carpocrates would have had it. One would like to know whether Donne did not do so only because this is the "First Song," con- cerned with subhuman forms of life. Would he have followed Carpocrates in this point later in the poem ? The question leads into might-have-beens. The impor- tant facts are that no more of the poem was written and that immoralism is not a tenet in what we have.63 In fact, Donne pursues the soul's "progresse" in the opposite (and much more orthodox) direction: the catastrophe, as he represents it, of the Fall. He broods on the Fall regretfully and at length. I think it likely that Donne did not go on with the Metempsychosis because he could not commit himself to further implementation of Carpocrates' world view in all its perverse and terrible consistency. But the poem as it stands is neither faulty nor incoherent in its handling of what Allen calls the "pre-text," which is this world view. For plant and animal life do not afford the degree of consciousness and self-possession required by Carpoc- rates' theory and practice of total immoralism. The stimulus which Epiphanes gave to Donne's poetic faculties was more im- mediate and intense than that of Carpoc- rates. I refer to Donne's myth of the soul's incarnations in plants and animals. This stark and sensuous animal imagery is, of course, preeminently a literal extension of Epiphanes' view of the human animal, on a par with the oxen, sheep, and goats which graze and couple under the impartial eye of the sun. Although Allen thought to preclude the possibility,64 Donne manages very well to particularize the general propositions of Concerning Righteousness and to mythologize its libertine philosophy. But the view of man within creation which Donne projects had the inevitable effect of diminishing man's dignity and stature, making him seem baser and paltrier than if viewed in separate-indeed, unique- terms. Epiphanes did not believe that his view was diminishing in the least, but he stands, perhaps, all alone. For a sense of its diminishment of man is undoubtedly what underlies the durable assumption that the Metempsychosis is a satire. Diminishment is certainly the effect of most other portrayals of the life of man in terms of the life of animals. I quote here from one such portrayal in the pseudo- Philonic Liber antiquitatum, a work which Grierson demonstrated Donne to have used in writing the Metempsychosis.65 The perspective expressed in this Jewish hag- gadic story shows the pervasiveness of Gnostic attitudes toward life in the body and the world during the first centuries of 63 As far as is now known, only one other Gnostic sect, the Cainites, joined the Carpocrateans in their philosophy of total immoralism. The Cainites, according to Irenaeus (Adversus haereses 1. 31), exalted Cain above all other men as the first murderer and so arch-enemy of the Creator of the world. This Creator is represented as being in opposition to the supreme God whose power and enlightenment motivated not only Cain but also Judas and all others who are (utterly wrongly, to the Cainites) regarded as the great sinners of human history. Donne refers to "cursed Cains race," who "blest" life with "plowing, building, ruling and the rest," and to "blest Seth," who "vext us with Astronomie" (Metem- psychosis 514-17). It is significant that this reference takes the form of moral paradox, eschewing any possible expression of immoralism.

The story is called "The Formation of the Child" (a subject also treated by Donne in his poem). It is found between pseudo- Philo's accounts of the Creation and the Fall. It begins with a description of the way in which souls are infused into bodies, and with the pleas of a particular soul to God not to be put into a body but, rather, to be left as it is in Paradise. The soul, however, is under an immutable neces- sity-which God wills but does not per- sonally execute, since the angel Lailah is charged with the work of putting souls in bodies. On the day that the soul is bound to the fertilized ovum, it is shown the Garden of Eden, where the blessed who were righteous dwell, and Gehinnom, the place of the tormented who disobeyed God. The angel Lailah also makes a daylong circuit with the soul, pointing out "every place where it is destined to tread, and the place where it will be buried." Again the soul bewails its fate and pleads to be left as it is. When at last the fetus has grown to full term, the same angel appears to com- pel it to be born. Again the soul pleads without avail. The angel Lailah causes the soul to be born into the world by striking it and extinguishing its light, so that it for- gets what it has seen. The soul enters the world weeping over its fate. The next section, where the ages of man through which the soul passes are compared in a series of images to diverse worlds and animals, may have suggested to Donne the narrative structure of the Metempsychosis. The quotation commences with the issu- ance of the crying child (a detail also found in Philo's De opificio mundi, Josephus's Jewish Antiquities, and Donne's last sermon, Death's Duel): And why does it cry ? Because of the world it has left behind. For at that moment seven new worlds are awaiting it. In the first world it is like unto a king after whose welfare all people ask; all desire to see it and embrace it, and kiss it, because it is in the first year. In the second world it is like unto a swine which wallows in mire; a child does the same until it reaches two years. In the third world it is like unto a kid that skips and gambols about on the meadows. Thus, a child skips about here and there until it is five years of age. In the fourth world it is like unto a horse which strides along haughtily. In the same way does a child walk along proud of his youth until he is eighteen years old. In the fifth world he is like unto an ass upon whose shoulders bur- dens are placed. In the same manner burdens are heaped upon man's shoulders; he is given a wife by whom he begets children. He must wander to and fro in order to obtain food for them until he is about forty years old. In the sixth stage he is like unto a dog, insolent and wandering about in all places for food: stealing and robbing in one place and en- joying it in another. In the seventh stage he is like unto an ape, whose appearance is chang- ed in every respect. All the household curse him and desire his death. Even the young children make fun of him, and even the smallest bird wakes him from his sleep. Finally the time arrives for him to quit this world. When that time arrives the same angel comes beside him and says to him, What is thy name? To which he replies "So-and-so, and why dost thou come to me today ?" "To take thee away from this world." When he hears this he weeps, and his voice reaches from one end of the world to the other, but no creature hears his voice except the cock. "Have I not already told thee," he says, "not to bring me forth from the world in which I have lived?" But the angel replies, "Have I not already told thee that against thy will thou wast created, against thy will thou wast born, against thy will thou livest, and against thy will thou shalt die, also against thy will thou art bound to render account and reckoning before Him who said, and the world was made ?" 66 66 The Chronicles ofJerahmeel, ed. and trans.

For ordinarily, if one looks at man as a beast, one views humankind as bestial. The tautology operates instinctively in the minds of men, who have their self-respect -largely dependent on their uniqueness and superiority in the creation-at stake. Thus Vives, in his Fable about Man, is care- ful to control and compress his account of men transforming themselves into animal shapes; he makes of the brief episode an illustration of human versatility, since his purpose (the opposite of Donne's) is to exalt men's capabilities, to show men as the wonder of the gods.67 If the view of man in "The Formation of the Child" diminishes human stature, Epiphanes' much more extreme and literal view of man as just another animal among animals has devastating implica- tions. For this reason, as Clement of Alexandria realized, Epiphanes' view was apt for turning around and applying to Epiphanes himself. Clement says that the philosophy of Concerning Righteousness is fit only for "the copulations of dogs and pigs and goats" (Stromateis 3. 2); later in the same work he complicates his criticism of heretical Gnosticism generally by ex- pressing the debasement worked by such doctrines in an analogy: "As if, then, one were to become a beast instead of a man, like those who were changed by Circe's drugs, so it is with him who has spurned the tradition of the Church and has suddenly taken up with the fancies of human sects; he has lost the character of a man of God" (Stromateis 7. 95).68 Donne in his metempsychosis narrative is like- wise able to utilize at one and the same time Epiphanes' view of men and Epi- phanes' (and Carpocrates') critics' view of libertine Gnosticism. The self-contained irony, while complexly redoubled, is per- fectly lucid and consistent, resulting in a poetic cosmos which is at once itself and a wry image of itself. Donne's cynical side responded to Epiphanes' brilliantly reductionist view of human nature and its linked main features of sexuality and community (Donne has a poem "Communitie"). He takes over directly Epiphanes' insistence on the free exercise of physical appetites, especially sexual desire. Some of the best passages in the Metempsychosis are in this Epiphanic vein: the sparrow sequence cited earlier, the nocturnal advances of the wolf upon Abel's bitch sheep dog, and the gamesome ape's attempted foreplay with Adam's daughter Siphatecia (408-25, 451-87). Knowledge of Epiphanes as a source helps us return to Donne's subtitle and under- stand better the connotations of the erotic action with a backlash which he indicated in calling his Podma Satyricon, not Satura. But beyond the general features of Donne's narrative, there is the matter of details-the progress of the soul from the apple to a mandrake to a sparrow to a little fish to another fish to a whale to a mouse to a wolf to a wolf-dog to an ape to Themech. I am as aware as anyone how hazardous it is to pronounce on Donnean "originality," which becomes a decreasing (or better defined) commodity as time goes on and we increase our knowledge of his work; but I do not think it likely that a source will be found for the precise stages of the soul's progress. I believe that the overtones. He also cites Gildemann's attempt to link legends of this type with the Egyptian child-god Horus (pp. lxiii- lxiv). 67 See Nancy Lenkeith's translation in The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, ed.

The trick of applying animal imagery to the Carpo- crateans seems actually to have originated with Celsus, the pagan opponent of Christianity, whose remarks in his True Doctrine (ca. 177-80) survive in Origen's quotations in Contra Celsum.

In- deed, it is very different in its realism, specificity, and this-worldly orientation from any other creation myth I have found. The closest parallel in religious literature would seem to be the Hexaemera of Basil and Ambrose. But these Fathers in their sermon series dwell raptly on the variety of living things and the inter- dependence (usually amiable) of all that moves and breathes. Their piety suffuses their vision with allegorical nuances that are usually the opposite of Donne's.69 Donne recognizes the inevitable moral allusiveness of his plants and animals for the constant in their nature that it was in his day, and he thoroughly exploits that allusiveness to show the sphere of creation as an experience of evil if not a work of evil. In doing this Donne is so graphic and anatomical that scholars have under- standably sought and found elements of his presentations in Aelian and Pliny, in the Physiologus and its successors, in Konrad Gesner's Historia animalium, and in other works of a scientific or quasi- scientific nature. I say it is unlikely that we will find a source for the myth of the Metempsychosis on the basis of findings that Donne used material peculiar to Renaissance sources, and hence could not have been relying on a single authority or on exclusively classical ones.70 We can be fairly confident that he did not "borrow anything of Antiquitie" in this regard. However, it certainly is possible to increase our understanding and appreciation of Donne's choice of images, and the intensity and coherence of the en- tire narrative sequence. Even a casual reader perceives that the succession of plants and animals conforms to evident literary specifications. Propriety of habitat is insured by the fact that every embodi- ment is named in Scripture, often in a con- text that gives the clue to its nature. Thus the mandrake has erotic connotations (Gen. 30:14-16, Song of Sol. 7:13); the sparrow images the vulnerability of the soul to ensnarement (Ps. 124:7); the whale is a great devourer (Jon. 1:17, Matt. 12:40); the ape is an item of luxury (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chron. 9:21). There also are links of various kinds-imagistic, possibly verbal, certainly hereditary-that rationalize and enforce the soul's progress. For instance, the apple on the Tree of Knowledge is genetically recessive in the apples of the mandrake, while in turn "this living buried man" adumbrates in its power of erotic stimulus the human form and character of Themech. Latin genera suggest cycles, or repetitions with varia- tions: the apple (mdlum) of evil (malum), the small fish nearly eaten by a ravenous pike (lupus) later becomes a wolf (lupus). In another way, by contrast and the motive of revenge, the whale and the elephant- and-mouse episodes form a pair. But these things are readily apparent. There is more to go on. In particular, Allen's note on the mandrake not only de- monstrates the role of the herbal lore in the Metempsychosis but also collects the Vul- gate readings that connect the plant with the apple and Garden of Eden, as well as the Physiologus disquisition on the eating of the mandrake by continent elephants, with a resultant carnal Fall that is explicitly compared with Adam and Eve's. Classical sources, too, contribute an emphasis on the erotic uses of the mandrake, which passes into language: Aphrodite acquires the epithet "the Mandragorite," and a 69 There is an English translation of Basil in A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, 2d ser., ed.

Savage, in The Fathers of the Church, vol. 42 (New York, 1961), pp. 3-283. In his treatment of marine life Donne often approximates Ambrose; see pp. 167-87. 70 Milgate has traced the destruction of the whale by the swordfish and thresher only as far back as an account of 1584, and the mouse's entering the elephant's trunk to gnaw its brain only to an account of 1563 (see "A Difficult Allusion in Donne and Spenser," Notes and Queries 211 [1966]: 12-14; John Donne: The Satires, Epigrams and Verse Letters, pp. 184-86).</page><page sequence="25">DONNE'S EPIC VENTURE IN THE "METEMPSYCHOSIS" 133 synonym for mandrake becomes circaea, "Circe's plant."" Even more mysteriously significant, in my opinion, are the associa- tions of the libidinous red ape unearthed by Janson.72 One remembers Donne's ape's "russet pawe" (478). Janson's re- search indicates that the associations of this animal with aggressive masculine sexuality are not Western in derivation (though a very few stories originating in Asia Minor filter down through Aelian, Timotheus, Peter Damian, and Cardano, until they finally make an impact in Gesner's popular and standard work). Janson is especially interested by the Re- naissance rediscovery of the "phallic ape" of ancient Egyptian art. He reprints a pro- digiously delineated Florentine engraving of a baboon from circa 1460-70 and offers this explanation of its provenance: Obviously it was not drawn from nature, nor could it have been freely invented on the basis of Aelian's remarks about the licentiousness of male cynocephali. Assuming, as we must, that our babuino derives from a visual antece- dent of some sort, the most likely prototype seems to be one of the ithyphallic cyno- cephali which occur on Greco-Egyptian Gnostic gems. In view of the well-known enthusiasm of the Quattrocento both for antique gems and for things Egyptian, we may be sure that any gem engraved with "hieroglyphics" was regarded as doubly precious. It would be hardly surprising, therefore, if the "gnostic baboon" evoked particular interest.73 The whole interest in things Egyptian, and especially in hieroglyphics as a model for the intensely emblematic visual and verbal arts of the Renaissance, is amply attested to by the popularity of the Hieroglyphicae of Horapollo Nilous and Valeriano. The former in particular, who claimed to be an Egyptian (the text is a Greek translation of a work probably written in the late fourth or early fifth century), supplies an extended and circumstantial account of the behavior of the sacred ape of Egypt."7 Since Donne's myth deals almost en- tirely with animals, and since animal worship was the most conspicuous feature of Egyptian religion, I have wondered whether he intended a definite Alexandrian allusiveness appropriate to Carpocrates and Epiphanes. I have been unable to per- ceive a pattern in the scattered materials I have found, but I summarize them briefly to show what there is. In the first place, Donne's plants and animals are as suitable to an Egyptian context as to a Scriptural (Mesopotamian) one. He chooses for his soul's embodiments a number of the sacred animals of Egypt, as they were known to Clement of Alexandria in the Roman im- perial period. In his Protreptikos (Exhorta- tion to the Heathen) Clement conducts a scathing exposure of the abominations and impostures of paganism. Having repre- hended the Greeks for worshiping gods who are patrons of sexual licence, he continues: How much better are the Egyptians, who in their towns and villages pay divine honours to the irrational creatures.... For although these are beasts, they are not adulterous or libidinous, and seek pleasure in nothing that is contrary to nature. And of what sort these deities are, what need is there further to say ...? Furthermore, the Egyptians whom I have now mentioned are divided in their objects of worship. The Syenites worship the braize-fish; and the maiotes-this is another fish-is worshipped by those who inhabit Elephantine; the Oxyrinchites likewise wor- ship a fish which takes its name from their country. Again, ... the Leucopolites worship a wolf, the Cynopolites a dog.75 7L D. C.

MUELLER The whale, sparrow, and mouse do not fall into the category of sacred animal; but, in the case of the last two at least, the Egyptian "hieroglyphic" content tallies with Donne's presentation. Horapollo re- lates of the sparrow (Hieroglyphica 2. 115): "When they [the Egyptians] wish to indi- cate a fecund man, they draw a sparrow on fire. For when the sparrow is troubled beyond measure by lust and an excess of sperm, it mates with the female seven times in an hour, ejecting all its sperm at once." Of the mouse he says (Hierogly- phica 1. 50): "To denote disappearance, they draw a mouse, since it eats all things, defiles them, and renders them useless."'76 If we are justified in discovering Egyptian associations in Donne's animals, they may be conveying extra ironies of the mis- adventures of the divine element, the soul, in the world. For in Donne's presentation of animals which other men once believed to be sacred, there is only the sense of "natural" behavior invested with human traits and vices. These animals show them- selves to be "equal" (as Epiphanes de- fined it) in nature with the rest. On the whole, however, Donne shows himself in the Metempsychosis to be no more capable of projecting Epiphanic equality or indifference than he was of pro- jecting Carpocratean relativism or im- moralism. Working with these materials in a poetic undertaking of such audacity seems finally only to have confirmed the strength of Donne's moral and religious character and to have made its expression the more imperative. Donne is ineffective only as devil's advocate in the poem; after stanza 11, which begins to probe the Fall with unanswerable queries, comes stanza 12 with its impassioned cry for release from the strain of such intellection: But snatch mee heavenly Spirit from this vaine Reckoning their vanities, lesse is the gaine Then hazard still, to meditate on ill, Though with good minde; their reasons, like those toyes Of glassie bubbles, which the gamesome boyes Stretch to so nice a thinnes through a quill That they themselves breake, doe themselves spill: Arguing is heretiques game, and Exercise As wrastlers, perfects them; Not liberties Of speech, but silence; hands, not tongues, end heresies. [111-20] Donne actually sounds like a spokesman for the Inquisition here. I do not press the point; rather, I mention it as an index to the moral seriousness that keeps coming to the fore in the Metempsychosis. The great instance is, of course, the treatment of the Fall of man, an oblique event in the poem but nonetheless its initial episode and the object of Donne's most intense and pro- tracted reflections. In this highly wrought series of stanzas (9-11), emotion and ratiocination mingle in a confused se- quence of images: the serpent as agent, woman as accomplice, man as victim, man through sexual desire as willing victim, woman as the immediate object of blame, and God (apparently, but here Donne breaks off) as the ultimate. The passage is much too unparticularized to trace to a source, but its patristic overtones have long been remarked and will be less strange now that Donne's reading in Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria has been demonstrated. IV It is evident, then, that Donne balked at continuing the Metempsychosis because of the implications of his source materials. If he could have been dispassionate, finally detached like Ovid, he would have per- publi6s par les membres de l'Institut franeais d'arch6ologie orientale du Caire, vol. 10 (Cairo, 1904). 76 The Hieroglyphics of Horapollo, trans.

But rather than take neither side, Donne found himself taking both. The Metem- psychosis as a poem is stymied in a fashion similar to the action of Hamlet-both pro- ductions of 1601-for there is no going onward when a mind is divided against itself. Donne's use of Carpocrates and Epiphanes attests the strength of the appeal exerted by antinomianism and moral nihilism, but these are not made the laws of his mythic universe. Only while he was still dealing with the soul in plants and animals was he able to forestall the in- evitable confrontation between the drift of his sources and the grain of his own nature; when the narrative reached a human consciousness it ground to a halt and reverted to Donne's own musings. For the narrative of the Metempsychosis, in contrast with its raw materials, is stubbornly and personally moral. The long early passage of autobiographical reflection (permissible, as Milton showed us, in epic) does reveal what the many critics who have focused on it claim. Donne was writing in a summer of discontent and taking stock of himself and his life. But if these were the conditions of com- position, does the poem retain its character as epic ? Or is it, after all, to be classed as satire ? The Gnostic materials are decisive, I think, in showing that the Metempsycho- sis is not a satire in the basic or usual sense: the vision is of a world so bad, and so inexorably and necessarily bad, that it is to be rejected, not reformed. There is only incidental room for satire here; it has no place in the main plan, which was to re- flect on ultimate concerns of human ex- perience in the world: the relation of soul to body, evil and change. That Donne chose epic for the treatment of such grave subjects is surely not to be wondered at, and there are, in addition, sufficient indica- tions that he was following (individualisti- cally, as always) the Ovidian model for epic. The seventeenth century, which made understanding of Donne's Metempsychosis primary and still admired Ovid as an epic poet, recognized the fundamental genre of the fragment and thus placed it at the head of the 1633 Poems. But while Ovidian epic alone afforded Donne the latitude for experiment and the tonal range he wished to apply in his portrayal of the soul's progress, even Ovid was too involved with the public forms of Roman-Augustan panegyric to constitute a complete prece- dent for Donne. By any standards, the Metempsychosis is a highly idiosyncratic epic. One of its chief idiosyncrasies is its relentlessly antiheroic bias. The fragment emanates a kind of Gnostic assurance about presenting the truth: "A worke t'outweare Seths pillars, bricke and stone, / And (holy writt excepted) made to yeeld to none" (9-10).77 Donne purports to give an account of the way the world really is-the predatory and destructive motives that govern all behavior once the agent comes to enough awareness and consent to take an active part in experience. Otherwise, the epic shows, one can only be the victim; there is no other role. The relentless realism and imaginative self-sufficiency of Donne's myth defeat, by implication, all impulses toward finding value in the world, all attempts to account for human and subhuman conduct in terms other than 77 One of the prominent features taken over in Gnosticism from heterodox Jewish thought at the turn into the Christian era was the assertion that one's own secretly received knowl- edge superseded the message of the Bible. While Donne's own claim does not go so far, he could not be unaware of the tonal similarities between it and the source materials on which he was drawing. Another conspicuous example of such Jewish and Gnostic antibiblical claims was that of the cab- balists, surely known to Donne, that the Cabbala contains the oldest and purest truths about God and the creation, as taught by sympathetic angels to the fallen Adam and Eve and transmitted orally thereafter by the patriarchs until the time of Simon ben Yochai (first century A.D.), when, to insure pre- servation of these truths, the first written account was made. On the relations between heterodox Judaism and Gnosticism, see Grant, Gnosticism and Early Christianity, pp. 1-69, and Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, pp. 33-37.</page><page sequence="28">136 JANEL M. MUELLER his. Yet here there is paradoxicality so deep that the myth could never have been carried to "Luther, and Mahomet." The force and vitality of Donne's presentation result from an absorption in the earthly (and earthy) that is maintained even as life in the body and the world emerges as something more and more to be despaired of. This is, I think, the enduring importance of Donne's flirtation with Carpocratean- ism: its ruthless logic catalyzed his moral nature and his religious proclivities. In the Metempsychosis Donne's utterance be- comes for the first time explicitly redemp- tionist, seeking and finding the hero that epic (and his heart) demanded. The Savior, the figure so prominently missing from the Third Satire, is invoked here as "That All, which alwayes was all, every where; / Which could not sinne, and yet all sinnes did beare; / Which could not die, yet could not chuse but die" (74-76). It is most interesting that Donne's whole first treatment of Christ is pervaded with those aspects of Gnostic thought which the church fathers made compatible with orthodox Christianity. One is the radical God-world duality that Donne reflects in pairing off "That All" against "this All" of the fallen world (27).78 Another is the very old idea, tracing back (like Gnosti- cism) to Jewish literature of the inter- testamental period, that a symmetry holds between the means by which man sinned and the means by which he is saved. This Donne expresses in the "guesse" of "devout and sharpe men" that the "Crosse, our joy, and griefe,... / Stood in the selfe same roome in Calvarie, / Where first grew the forbidden learned tree" (73-78). As Murray was the first to argue,79 the conjunction of Christ's cross and the Tree of Knowledge was not Donne's idea but a tradition of long standing in Christian thought and art. The stages in the development of this tradition have been documented in a num- ber of studies dealing with the legends of the Holy Rood from their barest inception down into the seventeenth century.80 The germ of the conjunction appears to be the doctrinal and homiletic reflection, found in Irenaeus and some Latin Fathers,81 that as Adam's tree brought sin and death upon man, so Christ's tree brought redemption and life. Another salient element was the tradition, which appeared among the Greek Fathers82 and became firmly estab- lished in the Greek church, that Adam was buried at Golgotha. The most interesting later elaboration of this Greek patristic line of thought (and the one most nearly resembling Donne's "guesse") occurs in the Anagogicarum contemplationum in Hexaemeron of Anastasius of Sinai (d. 700).83 This work ingeniously labors correspondences between Adam and Christ: one, which is unique as far as I have been able to determine, pairs Eden with Golgotha; another, the Tree of Life with Christ's Cross; still another, the Tree of Knowledge with the cross of the blas- pheming thief. Despite some ambiguity in Anastasius's phrasing, these links are not proposed as literal assertions of identity. They are, rather, the products of 78 See Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, p. 51, for an excellent discussion of the use of demonstrative locutions to express the essential cleavage in the Gnostic world view. 79 "What Was the Soul of the Apple?" pp. 146-48. 80 Adolpho Mussafia, "Sulla leggenda del legno della Croce," Sitzungsberichte der philosophisch-historischen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Wien) 63 (1870): 165-216; Otto Zickler, Das Kreuz Christi (Giltersloh, 1875); Wilhelm Meyer, "Die Geschichte des Kreuzholzes vor Christus," Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der K6niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissen- schaften 16(1882): 103-60; Esther Casier Quinn, The Quest of Seth (Chicago, 1962). 81 See Tertullian Adversus Judaeos 13 (PL 2:675); Julius Firmicus Maternus De errore profanarum religionum (PL 12:1037-38); Augustine, Appendix (Suppositia), Sermo 1. 4, and Sermo 84. 3 (PL 39: 1738, 1908), as cited by Quinn, p. 153, n. 35. 82 See Athanasius De passione et cruce Domini (Dubia) (PG 28: 205-8); Basil Commentarius in prophetam Isaiam 5 (PG 30: 347-48); Chrysostom Homilia LXXXV in sanctum Joannem (PG 59: 459); Epiphanius Adversus haereses 46. 5 (PG 41: 843-46).

Thus Anastasius was not a source for Donne, although he adumbrates the origin of the tradition in the eastern Mediterranean region or Asia Minor. The discrete body of Holy Rood legends is found in many works in various languages, of which the nearest to Donne in date and detail are Caxton's translation of the Legenda aurea and Tudor printed versions of Mandeville's Travels. However, no variant of the Holy Rood legends goes beyond saying that Adam was buried at Golgotha and that the Cross was made from a tree which grew on Adam's grave from a seed or a shoot of the Tree of Knowledge brought by Seth from Paradise.84 The very clear insistence on transposition shows that Golgotha and Eden were not thought of as the same place, and for this reason Donne's source must be sought elsewhere. That he had one is, I think, not to be questioned in the light of the near likenesses already apparent be- tween Donne's "guesse" and what is known of tradition. Interestingly enough, when Donne set out to write his next nonoccasional piece, La Corona, some six years later, he took over the lines on Christ from the Metem- psychosis into his Annunciation sonnet. He thereby signaled that he had abandoned his epic and had taken up a new form, devotional poetry. It appears that the un- achieved Metempsychosis had brought home to Donne the truths of his moral and religious character and, also and finally, his poetic one. He had undertaken a sub- ject invested with cosmic implications and a world historical perspective and had treated it in the most public of forms. As his subsequent work reveals, these were really not the terms in which he thought and felt. His abortive epic enforced the impossibility, for Donne, of an approach to life grounded in anything other than personal moral responsibility and an orthodox belief in salvation through Christ as the one hope of that life in the body and the world. All of Donne's work after the Metempsychosis reveals the exigencies of a personal ethic, a personal religion, and a personal mode of expres- sion. In these exigencies Donne is very much like Augustine, whose influence imbues his later work. Both men came to adopt an intensely subjective approach to experience, one which shifted emphasis from the metaphysics of the universe to the morality and spirituality of the self. In simpler words, the dilemma of the soul never ceased to preoccupy Donne, but never after the Metempsychosis did the problems of evil and change, of bodily existence, occur in his work as epic sub- jects or universalized concepts and systems. These problems were recast, in his later productions as poet and preacher, in terms of immediate psychological struggles -most often his own. As a transition piece by which Donne found his true personal and poetic direction, the Metem- psychosis is well placed at the head of his poems.
