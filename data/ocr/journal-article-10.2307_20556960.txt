<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gerard McCartney Some Considerations Concerning Computers i Computing is now an everyday term in our language. Computers are referred to in the press, on the radio and on television, and they appear in films and books ? with and without an aura of science fiction. But what do they mean to the man in the street? Some people may be exhilarated at the prospect of a computerised society, and others despondent; some may be sceptical, others indifferent to the whole subject. My purpose in this article is to show that, whatever our attitudes to computing, computers will play an increasingly central role in the ordinary events of modern life, a role that is not obvious and which must be closely monitored by those capable of controlling the effects of the new technology on society. A further point may also appear deceptively obvious: it is simply that there are important differences between the way man has always thought and the way machines and more particularly computers 'think'. ? hope to show that, however intelligent, accurate, fast and reliable computers may become, there are some acts of thought that ought to be attempted only by humans, and particularly by humans schooled in disciplines other than positive science. Much of what we regard today as good and useful, as well as much of what is called knowledge and wisdom, is owed to science. Nevertheless, beginning perhaps with Francis Bacon's misreading of the genuine promise of science,f man has been seduced into wishing and working for the establish ment of an age of rationality - but a rationality so twisted as to be equated with logicality. Thus man has all but reached the point where almost every human dilemma is seen as a temporary problem which can be untangled by judicious and appropriate applications of logical laws derived from some higher positivist standpoint. t editorial Note: The contribution and place of Francis Bacon in the development of modem science is often, it seems to me, misunderstood or misrepresented by modern scientists Benjamin Farrington sums up Bacon's position well when he writes (The Philosophy of Francis Bacon, Liverpool University Press, 1964, p. 43): 'Bacon is not . . . producing, would not have been capable of producing, a generalised expression of the mentality of the creators of modern science. He is not the spokesman of Vesiiliuv Copernicus, Galileo, Gilbert or Harvey. What he could do was something different. His dominant interest was in the conditions of human life. He had a vivid appieciation i?l the role hitherto played in history by technology, and a vivid antici pation nt die much greater effect that could be wrought on human life if technology could he made scientific. As the necessary preliminary to this change he wanted tcelmolo:'\ h&gt; he made liteiale'. M T</page><page sequence="2">18 THE MAYNOOTH REVI KW But no argument can undo the reality that science has become the major means of understanding in the modern world, the means by which other systems are to be justified. This involves the attribution of near certainty to scientific knowledge, an attribution now made so regularly that it has be come a kind of dogma of commonsense, and threatens to delegitimise all other ways of understanding. In former times man viewed the arts, especially literature, as sources of intellectual nourishment and understanding; but today the arts are perceived largely as entertainment,' and in times of economic crisis, superfluous entertainment. This rise in the credibility of science has been accompanied by a rise in the credibility of scientific apparatus. I hope to show how the tools of the scientific method have changed from being peripheral aids to man's quest to understand reality and have become central determinants of reality itself. II It is easy to understand how hand-held tools and especially hand-held weapons have direct effects on the consciousness of the individuals who use them. When hunters acquired spears, for example, they must have seen themselves in an entirely new relationship to their world: large animals which had previously raided their food-stores and which had been objects of fear now became their prey. Man's source of food grew, for now he could kill animals (including many species that had eluded him before) at a dis tance. The increased availability of food no doubt enlarged the domain over which man could range, and increased his likelihood of meeting other people. In sum, the change in man's experience of the world resulted in a corresponding change in his idea of his place in the world. Change of this kind has been particularly in evidence in modern society, and especially in the period accompanying and following the Industrial Revolution. Many machines are created specifically as functional additions to the human body. Some, like the lever and the steam shovel, extend the physical capabilities of their operators; others, like the microscope, the telescope and the radio, are extensions of man's sensory apparatus. It is not difficult to see how and why such 'prosthetic' machines enhance man's sense of power over the material world; they have the important psychological effect of per suading man that he can transcend the limitations imposed on him by the puniness of his body and senses. However, to understand the influence of 1. Bruno Walter puts this point well when he writes (Of Music and Music-Making, translated by Paul Hamburger, 1 aber and 1 aber, London, 1961, pp. 201*202): 'Materialism and intellectualism have taken hold of the present generation, and allotted to the arts a lower place in the life of society than the exalted sphere in which they have hitherto reigned. On that lower plane, however, there scarcely exists any distinction in rank between art and ordinary entertainment: they live next door to one another: and instead of festively raising themselves up to art from everyday life, or being lilted out of it by art, it is possible for people today to make a neighbourly call on it, quite at their pleasure and without any spiritual commitment or heightening of the emotions*.</page><page sequence="3">SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING COMPUTERS 19 such prosthetic machines simply in terms of the power they give to man is surely mistaken, even if we agree that man's eternal dream has been not merely the discovery of nature but its conquest; for the nature which modern man now perceives is fundamentally different from the 'reality' which man perceived before the scientific revolution. Indeed, what made possible the rise of modern science and the pre-eminence of the positive method was nothing less than a fundamental transformation of man's per ception of reality. My thesis is, therefore, that it was in man's perception of time and, consequently, in his perception of space that the fundamental change took place. From antiquity until relatively recently, the regularity of the universe had been searched for and perceived in great thematic harmonies. The idea that nature behaves systematically (as we understand it to), that is, that every part and aspect of nature can be isolated as a subsystem by laws dependent on time, could not have been understood by people who per ceived time not as a collection of abstract units (months, weeks, hours, minutes, seconds) but as a sequence of constantly recurring events. Classicly, time was a revolution of cycles and epicycles within cycles, not the linear progression of discrete instants we now 'know' it to be. The time units of this classical view, seasons and days, were cyclical and natural; and nature itself was seen to consist of phenomena which, while certainly discrete, were nonetheless constantly repeating metamorphoses of themselves, and hence permanent and implicitly eternal. Darwin, the creator of evolutionary theory, understood time in a radically different manner. He, like Marx and most other otherwise disparate Victorian thinkers, saw nature itself as a process in time and the individual phenomena of nature as irreversible metamorphoses. These Victorians were far from being the creators of the idea of progress, but they would have been unable to think in this manner had a linear conception of time not been an implicitly accepted part of the assumed knowledge of the period. And this linear conception of time had largely been caused by the arrival of a non-prosthetic machine, the clock. Lewis Mumford calls the clock, not the steam engine, M he key machine of the modern industrial age',2 and claims that the clock dissociated Time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences, the special world of science'. The im portance of the effect of the clock on man's perception of the world can hardly be exaggerated; our current view of time is so deeply ingrained in us that it is difficult for us to identify objectively the role that it plays in our thinking. The clock is mentioned here in order to show that a con ceptually simple but non-prosthetic or "autonomous'3 machine thai adds 2. Ivwis Muinl'ord Technics and Civilisation (tlaicowrl.

Nonetheless, the new reality is in effect an impoverished version of the older one, for it rests on a rejection of some of the direct experiences that formed the basis for the old reality. The feeling of hunger, for example, is no longer necessarily the stimulus for eating; instead one eats when the hands on a clock face indicate a certain time. Similar circumstances apply with regard to sleeping and rising, and to starting and finishing work. Man has his direct contact with nature reduced, and instead has reality mediated to him by a machine; he thus becomes more alienated from his environment, and ceases to be a creature in and of nature and instead becomes separate, removed, with a series of machines, both autonomous and prosthetic, regulating his contact with nature. This rejection of direct experience in favour of machine-mediated information has become one of the principal characteristics of the modern scientific age. The impetus contributed by the clock towards alienation from nature required centuries to affect man decisively; and even then theclockhad to combine with many other things to exercise real influence. Later tools, for example the telephone, the car and the radio, arrived in a culture already enthralled by the principle 'if some is good, more is better'. The hunger for more efficiency and more speed, often stimulated by the new devices them selves, enabled those devices to spread quickly through Western society, and encouraged that society's correspondingly rapid transformation under their influence. Ill The computer, originally designed as a prosthetic machine to speed mathe matical calculations, has quickly assumed a central place in the popular consciousness, and is credited by many with some form of intelligent self awareness (a belief which is grotesquely incorrect). The computer is neither merely prosthetic nor is it intelligent. The computer is a genuinely auto nomous machine operating according to its own internal system (which isa subset of the laws of human logic). The computer can manipulate these laws so rapidly that it appears, to the unschooled, to be in some way superior to its human creators. Furthermore, it appears to have made itself indispensable to the running of modern society. The computer becomes an indispensable element of a structure once it is so thoroughly enmeshed in that structure's substructures that it can no longer be eliminated without fatally impairing the whole system. Thus the introduction of computers into some complex human actions may constitute an irreversible commitment. Indeed, it can be said that though the com puter was not a prerequisite to the survival of modern society, its enthusiastic and often uncritical acceptance by the more progressive elements of Western society (in government, business and industrial circles) has quickly made il a resource essential to that society's survival.</page><page sequence="5">SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING COMPUTERS 21 As an example of this, we can consider the role of computers in the British Welfare State. It is possible that a success could have been made of administering the welfare services manually if the dispensing of these services had been organized locally and regionally. Instead, the computer was used to automate and centralise the administration of the social services.4 If automation and centralisation had not been decided upon, an entirely different system, such as negative income tax, might in due course have become a possibility. However, the establishment of a large and com plex computer-based system created self-serving interests which helped to maintain and perpetuate the welfare system itself. Such interests soon be come substantial barriers to innovation even if good reasons for innovation later accumulate: many of the organizational problems, resulting from growth, which came to the surface during the '60s and '70s could have served as incentives for real organizational change. Instead, the invention of the computer prompted those in charge to eschew all thoughts of substantive change. Initially, the computer was used mainly to do things as they had always been done, but to do them more rapidly or (as some would say) more efficiently. To say this is not to distinguish the computer from other tools: only rarely, if ever, are a tool and an altogether original job for the tool invented at the same time. Nevertheless, new tools involving new standards or methods of task performance can transform the previous situation and in turn cause the invention of hitherto unimaginable tools. In 1803, a hundred years after the first stationary steam engines had found common use in England to pump water, Trevithick put the steam engine on to a carriage and the carriage on to a horse-tramway in Wales. This imaginative placing in an entirely new context of the stationary steam engine transformed that engine into the locomotive and began the development of the horse-tramway into the modern railway. We can thus see that there are two stages in the development of a machine. First, there is the prosthetic machine which helps man with a technical problem, so that the job is now done more quickly, more easily or more efficiently. The second stage is the result o\' human creativity or imagination: man identifies an innovative use for a particular machine for which that machine had not originally been designed. This second stage may well make the machine autonomous, because the machine's modus opcrandi in its original prosthetic function may make it 'unsuitable* for the new process to which it is applied. Thus although the machine may be tech nically efficient in its new situation, it may also upset fundamentally the process to which it is now applied by imposing its own limitations on that process. For example, the computer has sometimes been used as an alter native counselling advisor for psychiatric patients, lit these cases, the com 4.

The likely explanation for this lies in the fact that it is not only what the therapist says to the patient that is therapeutic but t!u;t it is a person who is talking to the patient; when a machine replaces the person, a primary benefit of the therapy is lost. The inadequacy of the computer in this situation does not spring from any technical weakness of the computer or of its programmers but from the simple inappropriateness of applying a machine to this type of job. The error occurs because the project managers do not first analyse the important ingredients, and the parts played by them, of the process they are trying to computerise. Sometimes too the computer forces its own system in an invalid way on to the system being computerised. A computer works internally by a complicated series of 'ON' - 'OFF' switches; electric impulses follow certain paths5 through the machine before arriving at various conclusions. The main problem arises when a machine that, by its very nature, can only distinguish between 'ON' and 'OFF' is brought face to face with the concepts of doubt and probability. There must be a serious question mark over the validity of using a machine that is based on absolutes to produce answers to problems where absolute answers do not necessarily even exist. Another interesting instance of this kind of difficulty can be illustrated in the use of computers for producing translations from one language to another. A computer works within a set of clearly defined laws, whereas language often does not. It is not difficult to think of examples of every day expressions which, though perfectly clear in meaning, have broken the rules of grammar (e.g. 'Eyes right', 'Dead Slow'); by contrast, the com puter is based on a logical system, confined to logical rules. There is an amusing story about a computer project for translating Russian into English and vice versa. To test the system's effectiveness, the designers fed the translations back into the computer, setting the machine to restore the translations to the originals. In one case they went from English to com puter Russian and then from computer Russian back into computer English. The computer produced a new word, 'watergoat'. The designers knew that there had been nothing like that in the original, and on going back to the English original found the offending words: 'hydraulic ram'. Another dangerous tendency that has emerged is what might be called 'computer anthropomorphism'. It is easy to see how the comparison of man and machine has developed, and how a false image of the computer has been built up. The computer. like man. receives information from the world around it, and it is programmed to classify that information, store it and 5. It is important to realise that these paths are selected in two ways: first, by the programmers (i.e. those who create the 'operating system') who decide on the way the machine itself will operate; and, secondly, by the analyst who writes the programme tor the specific ?ob for which the computer in question is about to be used. It is un usual for the computer user himself to select the logical paths, and he will therefore usually be completely dependent on the knowledge of the Systems Analyst whose job it is to determine the correct paths for the programme.</page><page sequence="7">SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING COMPUTERS 23 then (in a programmed way) reproduce whatever elements of that informa tion are necessary in a given situation. It is easy to call the storage process 'memory', even though human memory is a far more complex affair; and the data absorption of the computer can equally easily be referred to as 'reading' or 'listening'. From these simple descriptive distortions are de veloped the concept of artificial intelligence and the other anthropomorphic terms now used to describe computer performance. But the computer, as a machine, does not understand; it cannot know or plan. Specialist computer terminology is therefore necessary to describe the new functions of com puters; it is simply inaccurate and misleading to borrow existing words from other contexts and to apply them to computers. What is needed is the creation and implementation of a new vocabulary to cover the unique world of computers and computing. Computer literacy then becomes an important subject in its own right. It is also essential to understand that improving the technical efficiency of a process by a method such as computerisation contributes nothing to the validity of that process. There are, foi example, computer programmes that carry out with great precision, far more quickly and in far greater detail than any human astrologer, all the calculations necessary to cast the horoscope of an individual. But such an improvement in technique is ir relevant if astrology is nonsense in the first place; computerised astrology is just as surely nonsense. On the other hand, where simple techniques may be insufficient because of their very simplicity, the greater detail of computer analysis may be beneficial: weather forecasting, with its dependence on de tailed statistical analysis, is a case in point. While prosthetic machines can only affect the efficiency of a process, autonomous machines can interfere with the process itself. The critical question we have to ask, therefore, is: kHow do we know whether a computer is being used prostheticaliy or autonomously?' The computer was originally designed as a prosthetic number processor; and allied tasks such as simple robotics derive easily from this original design. Robotised car assembly lines, for example, are methodologically identical to manually operated assembly lines. The difficulty and the danger of computerisation lie in the use of the computer for tasks which do not ultimately depend on number processing. It is a moot-point, for example, whether human behaviour or even animal behaviour is reducible to a series of absolute laws; and if it is not, then any attempt to use comput?is for the study of human or animal behaviour is doomed to failure. Again, we must ask whether decision-making can be reduced to a series of laws. Already many management problems are treated as information processing problems, amenable to analysis by computers; and business managers satisfy them selves with interpreting the information derived from this computer analysis. In these circumstances the illusion is maintained (and it is no more than an illusion) that man is still the decision-maker. But a computing system which accepts only certain kinds o( data, which operates within arbitrarily chosen yet distinct laws, which is applied indiscriminately, and the output of which</page><page sequence="8">24 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW is often not even in principle understood, but accepted unquestioningly as correct, by many who use it, is at best inaccurate and at worst dangerous.
