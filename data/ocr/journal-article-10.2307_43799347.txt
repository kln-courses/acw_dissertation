Influenced by both Christian and Buddhist metaphysics, he presented the world as dynamic and interrelated, with the sacred wholly immanent in phenomenal reality. He strongly criticized capitalism and the nation state, and he praised anarchists who resisted centralized power. His ideal was communitarian anarchism characterized by a feeling of unlimited responsibility for all. However, he eventually lost revolutionary hope, and his later poetry focused on mystical moments in communion with nature. Keywords Kenneth Rexroth, organic worldview, anarchism, communitarian, nature mysticism, revolution- ary hope Kenneth Rexroth (1905-82) was one of the most important American poets of the twentieth century, with a strikingly complex worldview. One reason for that richness is that two different religious traditions, Catholicism and East Asian Buddhism, shaped his views. In his earlier writings, especially before the 1950s, Catholicism was predominant. Later, especially starting in the 1950s, Buddhism became an increasingly predominant influence, as well as the Chinese and Japanese literary traditions. Adding to the complexity of Rexroths worldview is the fact that he was both a deeply spiritual nature poet and a radi- cal social critic. Nature writing is often thought of as the product of solitary experiences of the natural world unsullied by social problems, as "narratives of retreat" in Randall Roodas words (Roorda 1998). For Rexroth, however, they are closely interrelated, and at times they are fused in his writings. One way we can capture this integrated complexity is to speak of Rexroths worldview as organic. Indeed, both Rexroth and literary critics have used that term to describe his vision. But while the term is in many ways helpful in interpreting his works, there are tensions that need close analysis.

Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 associate an organic view with one that rejects a split between transcendence and imminence, yet transcendence is a prominent theme in his writings and in scholarship on Rexroth. Is Rexroth ambivalent or contradictory toward these themes? We also consider an organic view as one that eschews anthro- pocentrism, but personalism, which usually emphasizes the human, was an important theme. Does his personalism amount to an anthropocentrism that creates a rift in his organic vision? In addition, the relation between spirituality and politics changed over the decades of his writing, with an apparent split between them. Is there a fundamental shift in his view of spirituality and poli- tics? By examining these tensions in the organic nature of his worldview, we can develop a more subtle understanding of Rexroths vision and explore the possibilities for an organic spirituality. Kenneth Rexroth Since Rexroth is not as well known as he should be, it is worth making some biographical comments before examining his worldview.1 He was born in Indiana into a family with abolitionist, socialist, and feminist heritage, a pro- gressive perspective that continued throughout his life. Spirituality came early as well. In his Autobiographical Novel , he recounts several mystical experiences of "peace and well-being" (1991: 77) that he would later cultivate into an abiding religious vision. His mother died when he was eleven, his father two years later, and Rexroth lived with relatives in several Midwestern locations during his youth. In 1918, he moved to Chicago, where he attended high school and the Art Institute. He also was exposed to the wretched conditions of meatpacking workers that Upton Sinclair documents in The Jungle ,2 and he became active in bohemian culture, radical politics, and avant-garde art. In the 1920s he traveled to the East coast, West Coast, Europe, and Mexico, set- tling in San Francisco in 1927. During the 1930s he was active in radical politics of California and began writing poems of the Sierra Mountains and anarchist struggles in Europe and the U.S.3 Rexroth is still most famous as the leading figure in the San Francisco 0 For a biography rich in detail but thin in intellectual analysis, see Linda Hamaliansy4 Life of Kenneth Rexroth.

Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 3 Renaissance from the late 1940s to the early 1960s.4 With his interest in East Asian culture intensifying in the 1950s, he began to publish translations from the Japanese and Chinese,5 as well as from other languages. Starting in the late 1950s but especially in the 1960s he became what is sometimes called a public intellectual by writing essays on literature and society in journals such as the Saturday Revient* and in the popular press.7 In 1968 he moved to Santa Barbara, California, where he made his home until his death. In 1967 and 1974-75, Rexroth visited Japan and other countries in Asia. An Organic Philosophy of Nature Through six decades of writing, one of the most consistent themes is an organic worldview. In his Autobiographical Novely Rexroth credits British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, the founder of process philosophy, with giving him the foundations of "a philosophy of organic process" (392). The term process points to one way that his philosophy is organic: reality is fundamentally dynamic rather than inert. There are two main aspects to his philosophy of change. The first is a cosmology of process. Reality is ever-flowing, with all things always interacting with each other. Here Whitehead s view was particu- larly influential, but, as Rexroth stated, Daoism holds a similar view (392). 8 The other major aspect of Rexroths philosophy of change is largely Buddhist, particularly as it was developed in classical Japanese literature and aesthetics. Rather than process, the key point here is transience: all things pass away. According to traditional Buddhism, impermanence is one of the 4) For two anthologies that are representative of this movement, see Allen and Meitzer. For a study, see Davidson. Occasionally Rexroth is thought of as a Beat poet or the "father" of the Beats. The Beat movement was part of the San Francisco literary renaissance and Rexroth was influential to writers in that movement, and initially he gave public support to those writers. But Rexroth soon distanced himself from what he considered the excesses of the movement, though he continued to champion one of the great Beat poets, Allen Ginsberg. For more on his relation to the Beats, see Hamalian 1991: 238-72. 5) One Hundred Poems from the Japanese was published in 1955, followed by One Hundred Poems from the Chinese in 1956. Many other volumes of translation from the Japanese and Chinese followed. 6) Most were eventually collected in books, such as Classics Revisited ( 1 969) and The Elastic Retort (1973). 7) He was hired by the San Francisco Examiner and then the San Francisco Magazine. Many of these are available online at Ken Knabbs valuable "Kenneth Rexroth Archives". 8) Although Buddhism is the primary Asian influence on Rexroth, Daoism has been more sig- nificant to his work than most have recognized. An analysis of the nature and significance of Daoism in Rexroth would be a fruitful focus of analysis, but it cannot be attempted here. For his reflections on the Daodejingy see the Elastic Retort (1973: 7-11).</page><page sequence="4">4 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 "three characteristics of reality." Rexroths view of impermanence resonates with one of the prominent themes in traditional Japanese literature: mujõ-kan. Literally the "feeling of transience," this term refers to the bittersweet accep- tance that all things of value perish - and therefore they are experienced with acute attention and tranquil sorrow. Rexroth captures this quality beautifully when he admonishes his young daughter to "Believe in all those fugitive / Compounds of nature, all doomed / To waste away and go out" (Rexroth 2002: 538).9 A second major theme involved in his organic philosophy is immanence, as Rexroth rejects a dualistic and hierarchical view of a realm above nature. Citing Whitehead again, he affirms that spiritual reality involves an "imma- nent, rather than transcendent, deity" (1991: 392). In such a non-dualistic universe, the sacred is not located in some other realm separate from nature. Instead it is wholly within the phenomenal world, and fully available to us: "The holiness of the real / Is always there, accessible / In total immanence" (2002: 545).'° In discussing the sacrality of this world, he sometimes uses the Catholic discourse of sacramentalization. Rexroth often articulates his own views by seeing them in other writers.11 In the writings of D. H. Lawrence, for instance, he finds ". . . the newly valued world of birds, beasts, and flowers - a sacra- mentalized, objective world. 'Look, we have come through' - to a trans- formed world, with a glory around it everywhere like ground lightning" (1959: 192). Similarly he argues that "Teilhard [de Chardin] owes his power to his vision as a contemplative, to his aesthetic realization of the sacramentalization of all being, and of history as the slow divinization of man" (1973: 45). It is the poets task to embody that realization, for the poet, Rexroth claims, is "one who creates / Sacramental relationships / That last always" (2002: 293).12 Rexrotbs views recall what American theologian Sallie McFague has termed a 9) There are countless analyses of impermanence in Buddhism and Japanese literature. For a discussion of how impermanence is developed in the travel journals of the famous Japanese haiku poet Bashõ, see Barnhill 1986. For a discussion of aware in Japanese thought, see Barnhill 1988. I()) Donald Gutierrez's "The Holiness of the Real" includes an insightful analysis of the theme of immanence. M) Rexroth wrote many short articles on writers (especially those considered "classic"), starting from the origins of Western civilization and also from Europe and Asia. See Rexroth 1969, 1973, and 1989. ,2) Two significant examinations of Rexroths sacramental view are found in Robertson 1975 and Tipton 1987. Robertson argues that he can find "no evidence that Rexroth believes in the Christian God or in the efficacy of the Christian sacraments" (14). While Rexroth was certainly no orthodox Catholic, I suggest that his essays on Catholicism do show his belief</page><page sequence="5">D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 5 "revived sacramentalism," in which "We meet the world as a Thou, as the body of God where God is present to us always in all times and in all places' (McFague 1987: 77, qtd in Buell 2005: 107). In some of his writings, Rexroth describes the sacrality of this world in Buddhist terms. In Hearts Garden , Gardens Hearty a long poem he wrote in Japan in 1967, we read that "This village of stone / Carvers and woodcutters is / Its own illimitable Buddha world" (Rexroth 2002: 661-62). The title of that poem alludes to the famous Buddhist scripture the Heart Sutra in two ways. The first, of course, is the use of the term heart. The second is the chias- mic structure of the title, which echoes the most famous line of the sutra: "emptiness is form, form is emptiness". The point of these words is that true spiritual reality (emptiness) is none other than the phenomenal world (form). The phenomenal world is ultimate reality in part because - despite the disor- der and anxiety that are so apparent - it is fundamentally characterized by mystical stillness. In an earlier long poem, The Dragon and the Unicorn (1952), he depicts reality as having at its core a Buddhistic stillness of vision. And Buddha - at the center Of being is the act of Contemplation, unqualified, Unique, unpredictable (Rexroth 2002: 519). Rexroths view is organic also in the sense that the elements of reality are inter- related into a complex and infinite whole. To articulate the interconnected nature of reality, Rexroth draws in particular on Chinese Huayan Buddhism, which is famous for its image of Indras net, a web of infinitely reflective jewels in which all things appear as both distinct (individual jewels) and interpene- trating (the endless inter-reflecting of each jewel in every jewel): "Each moment of the universe / And all the universes / Are reflected in each other / And in all their parts and / Thence again in themselves" (Rexroth 2002: 337).' 3 in the efficacy of those sacraments for those in the Catholic tradition (see especially "The Evolution of Anglo-Catholicism" and "Some Notes on Newman" in Elastic Retort 207-56 and 257-68). More explicitly, in "Faith in an Age of Faithlessness" he claimed that "Men stay in the Church because they know empirically that the sacraments provide the food and drink of a life of communion and illumination. All the rest is distraction" (1970: 92). Robertson writing in 1975 would not have known that on year before his death, Rexroth would receive Roman Catholic baptism on Easter Sunday, 1981 (Gibson 1986: 30). However, Robertson is certainly correct in arguing that Rexroths complex sacramentalism was not limited to what is traditionally found in institutional Catholicism. ,3) See Gutierrez 1996a (53-93) for an analysis of the theme of interrelationship in the context of natural supernaturalism. While mirroring is a prominent image of interrelatedness, light can also serve that function. As Samuel Baity Garren notes concerning Rexroths important poem</page><page sequence="6">6 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 Rexroth often emphasizes this interrelatedness of nature along with its dynamism, as when he writes of "The continuously shifting / And flowing organism / Of relationships" (Rexroth 2002: 337), or in a later poem when he speaks of "Shifting darkness, / Strains of feeling, lines of force, / Webs of thoughts all / The webs, and nets, of relationships / Changing" (Rexroth 2002: 610). Reflecting on the view of nature presented in his Autobiographical Novel, Daniela M. Ciani has observed that "It is evident there how a loving curiosity about rivers, lakes, mountains, prairies, animals, sci- ences are one with the understanding of life itself - they stand in an organic relationship. It is from this that Rexroths whole philosophy springs" (Ciani 1980: 15). Humans are fully and organically part of this integrated whole. His poem "Toward an Organic Philosophy" (1940) ends with these words: "Thus," says Tyndall, "the concerns of this little place Are changed and fashioned by the obliquity of the earths axis, The chain of dependence which runs through creation, And links the roll of a planet alike with the interests Of marmots and of men" (Rexroth 2002: 166-167). Reflecting on his life in An Autobiographical Novel (1991: 377), he concludes that "My poetry and philosophy of life became what its now fashionable to call ecological. I came to think of myself as a microcosm in a macrocosm, related to chipmunks and bears and pine trees and stars and nebulae and rocks and fossils, as part of an infinitely interrelated complex of being". He found such a view in classical Chinese poetry, where "Man and his virtues are a part of the universe, like falling water and standing stone and drifting mist" (1959:18). Rexroth frequently emphasizes the vastness of the universe in both space and time, and he experiences his physical continuity with the cosmos. Blood flows out to the fleeing Nebulae, and flows back, red With all the worn space of space, Old with all the time of time. It is my blood. "The Signature of All Things," "Owls, Holstein heifers, decomposing wood, from the moral law within to the starry heaves without - all share the same radiance. The light that shines through- out the universe in all beings is the 'Signature of All Things'" (39).

Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 7 The personal/cosmic blood becomes a way of communing with a lover. "In the mirrors on its waves / 1 can see faces. Mostly / They are your face" (2002: 525). As Allan Johnston has noted, "This 'blood,' the substance common to both Rexroth and the universe, establishes an identity between himself and the other that is realized as the reflection of the self in nature" (2002: 90). We can refine our understanding of the organic nature of his philosophy by examining two themes in his writings that might seem to undercut the organic quality of his view of nature. The first is transcendence. As we saw earlier, Rexroth cites Whitehead as an influence of his view of an "immanent, rather than transcendent, deity". However, transcendence is a common theme throughout his writings. Does this mean that there is, for Rexroth, a transcendental realm separate from nature? If not, how can he speak of transcendence? For Rexroth there is a transcendental reality, but it is a dimension of this phenomenal world. Thus he speaks of an empirical mysticism of a transcen- dent reality that is always present to us. "Buddhism is certainly pure religious empiricism," he argues. "It has no beliefs, only the simply and purely defined religious experience which becomes for the experience« an always accessible and ever-abiding present reality. The foundation for this ... is the Noble Eightfold Path, whose culmination is the unruffledness' - Nirvana - which underlies reality" (1991: 338). Note how the common sense dualism between subjective and objective, the psychological and the ontological, is absent: the contemplatives tranquil experience and the serene quality of reality cohere. This dimension of reality is transcendent in that it requires a transcendent experience to apprehend it. Samuel Baity Garren is right in using the language of depth of immersion rather than that of going beyond. In commenting on Rexroth s "The Signature of All Things," he states that "After observing events in nature and thinking of the past, the narrator achieves a sense of release and insight. . . . This moment could be called transcendence except for the insis- tence that the liberating experience does not occur by going beyond the natu- ral world but by a deeper immersion within it" (Garren 1986: 36). Rexroth puts the seeming paradox of transcendence and presence another way. "The permanent core of thought could perhaps be called a kind of tran- scendental empiricism. . . . The real objects are their own transcendental meaning. . . . The holy is in the heap of dust - it is the heap of dust" (1968a: iii). Spiritual reality is empirical because it is found in this world, even a heap of dust. But that reality is transcendental because normal conscious- ness - common sense, reason, and science - cannot comprehend it. Moreover, there is no bifurcation of the sacred and profane, even in the sense of the sacred being in the profane. Everything in the phenomenal world is itself</page><page sequence="8">8 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 ultimate reality. As literary critic and Rexroths friend Morgan Gibson puts it, "transcendence is experienced in immanence, and immanence is transcen- dent" (Gibson 1986: 77). Rexroth captures the dialectical relation between immanence and transcendence in his analysis of the British novelist and poet D. H. Lawrence: "Reality streams through the body of Frieda, through everything she touches, every place she steps . . . everything stands out lit by a light not of this earth and at the same time completely of this earth . . (1959: 189). More than nature philosophy is involved. Rexroth also articulates a social quality in his organic philosophy. For Rexroth, "the only Absolute is the Community of Love with which Time ends" (1968a: ii). This Community of Love is the entire community of life apprehended in love.14 The mystic unifies not with a transcendental God but rather with the whole of this world throughout time and with all others who share life with him. In this sense, we can say that Rexroth articulated a communitarian mysticism. While mysticism is often thought of as a withdrawal from phenomenal reality leading to an individuals communion with a divine reality separate from this world, for Rexroth mysticism is an entrance into a contemplative community. "I believe that there is a community in the world, a community of love. It is a commu- nity of contemplators. And the only reality is a perspective, but the perspec- tives are infinite because the contemplators are infinite" (1979: 34). This social conception of spiritual reality leads us to consider the second theme that might seem to undercut an organic view of reality: personalism. This theme was common in his writings from the 1930s to the 1950s.15 Here the problematic is not transcendence but anthropocentrism. The organic char- acter of Rexroths worldview is challenged by a view that would seem to give humans a special place and value. Does Rexroths personalism detract from a truly organic philosophy? Rexroths personalism has three primary sources. The first is the Vienna- born Jewish philosopher Martin Bubers (1878-1965) notion of I-Thou rela- tionship, which had a profound influence on the poet.16 While all things are deeply interrelated and form an organic whole, still the relation between oneself and another is primary. The reality of that relationship is fulfilled only l4) For important studies of Rexroths notion of the community of love, see Bartlett 1988 and 1989. ,5) Rexroths fullest development of his personalism is found in his long poem The Dragon and the Unicorn , published in 1952 (2002: 323-522). 16) See Buber 1970. For one of many studies of Bubers I and Thou, see Kramer. For Rexroths understanding of Buber, see "The Hasidism of Martin Buber" (1959: 106-42).</page><page sequence="9">D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 9 in treating the other as a subject, one which has unqualified value. By realizing the I-Thou relationship with an individual, which he terms the dual, one can then expand ones spiritual awareness of relatedness, eventually to include the entire world. Such an intense connection is characterized not only by love but also by shared pain. The beloved, is known and Loved more and more fully, all The universe of persons Grows steadily more and more real. Eventually loss or pain To the least of these, the most Remote known person of the Other, is felt personally Through the intense reality Of the dual (2002:413). The second influence is the French Catholic Gabriel Marcels (1889-1973) philosophy of "being as interpersonal dialogue".17 The I-Thou relationship is neither abstract nor passive, but a communicative exchange among persons: "There is no reality / Except that of experience / And experience is the / Conversation of persons" (2002: 335). Such a view is directly related to Rexroths assertion that the primary nature and purpose of poetry is commu- nication. "Poetry is seen as interpersonal communication," Gibson notes, "originating in contemplation (communion, vision) and re-creating commu- nity" (1986:4). Indeed, as Luis Ellicot Yglesias states, "The final responsibility is communication" (1980: 103). The third major influence on his personalism is the British idealist John McTaggart (1866-1925), who, Rexroth recalls, "was the Western philosopher I read most extensively in the war years. . . . [H]is belief that all existences are only perspectives on persons fascinated me. . ." (1991: 51 1-1 2). 18 Reality does not consist simply of things in relationship. Reality has a quality we normally associate with consciousness: perspective. Our being is a distinctive perspective on the world we share with others, who are also perspectives. Whether we realize it or not, experience is the interaction of these perspec- tives: "a concourse of persons, all / Reflecting and self-reflecting / And the reflections and the / Reflective medium reflecting" (2002: 337). What we might call his interperspectival view resonates closely with Huayaii Buddhism l7) Rexroth mentions the influence of Marcels personalism in his Autobiographical Novel (511). Among Marcel s many important works is his two volume The Mystery of Being. I8) McTaggart s seminal work, especially concerning time, is The Nature of Existence.</page><page sequence="10">10 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 and its image of Indras net mentioned earlier. In fact, Rexroth adds that, "McTaggarts ideas - his infinite pluralism of contemplators, his atheism, his disbelief in the soul in the sense of Western philosophy - are all assimilable to Buddhism" (1991: 512). What keeps this view from being anthropocentric is that Rexroth does not confine the term person to humans. In The Dragon and the Unicorn we read: "All things, all entities of / Whatsoever nature are / Only perspectives on per- sons" (2002: 336). A "person" is anything treated as part of an I-Thou rela- tionship, anything given full reality and value and attention, anything we treat with unqualified love, without grasping. Once David Robertson asked Rexroth about his use of both Eastern and Western views of humans and nature. He replied, "The important thing is the community of love, and the community of love is all the world". In other words, he has kept the western notion of love as the supremely important element in the relationship between self and other, but has expanded the category of lover to include all things. This means, in effect, that he can relate as directly to trees and mountains and rivers as he can to a woman (25). Rexroths nature poetry is, in fact, a poetry in which birds and mountains and rivers are experienced as a person, as part of an I-Thou relation. This point is at the core of both his intense communion with nature and his passionate sense of social responsibility. Rexroths personalism does not devalue nonhu- man nature but rather treats it with the unqualified value given humans.19 So Rexroths organic philosophy includes a sense of transcendence within the immanent world and a personalism that views nature as an all-embracing communion of subjects. The relationship between these two themes is subtle. Gibson has stated that transcendence and personalism are "contradictory con- cerns that Rexroth struggled throughout his life to reconcile in his poetry: his intuitions of a transcendent metaphysical harmony on the one hand, and immanent personalism on the other; or put another way, the amorality of existence and the personal demand for justice" (1986: 62-63). I would offer a different interpretation. I see these two themes not as contradictory but as two sides of the same coin. Conventional distinctions are dissolved: transcendence/ immanence, transcendence/personalism, things in nature and persons in the social world. Transcendence refers to the mysterious depth and meaning of the immanent, phenomenal world, fathomed only by a contemplative who has gone beyond the limits of reason and acquisitiveness. Personalism is a term for ly) For an important analysis of personalism among various groups (including the Beats) in the 1960s, see Farrell 1997.

Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 1 1 how the contemplative attends to individual things in both the social and natural worlds, realizing the boundless value of each individual entity and responding to it with an interwoven sense of love and responsibility. Nature and Political Critique Rexroths philosophy is organic not simply in its interweaving of the human and more-than-human worlds, of immanence and transcendence, or transcen- dence and personalism. It also combines mystical vision with a trenchant social critique and personal resistance to the corruptions of the world. Part of the power and significance of Rexroths writings is the dialectic between mysti- cal vision and social analysis that yields an organic, communitarian politics. Reflecting on his memoir, he notes that for him, "political revolt was a quest for the largest organic community" (1991 : xvi). Rexroths Community of Love is not simply a metaphysical but also a political term. In his Preface to his Collected Longer Poems he states, The political stance of the poems never changes - the only Absolute is the Community of Love with which Time ends. Time is the nisus toward the Community of Love. One passage is a statement in philosophical terms of the IWW Preamble, another of the cash nexus passage in The Communist Manifesto. "The State is the organization of the evil instincts of mankind". "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". "Property is robbery" (1968a: ii-iii). The Community of Love is both a metaphysical absolute and the primary social context, one that entails moral and political responsibilities based on the experience of unqualified love. The fulfillment of those political responsibili- ties is co-dependent with spiritual fulfillment. "Ultimately the fulfillment / Of reality demands that / Each person in the universe / Realize every one of the / Others in the fullness of love" (2002: 140). The dialectics between mystical vision and political analysis implies that political involvement is natural in two senses. First, politics is rooted in the communitarian, ecological structure of reality. We are not autonomous indi- viduals, with social relatedness and political interests accidental to who we are. We essentially are our relationship with others, each one being a perspec- tive on all others, each one being in dialogical relation to all others. That interdependency implies moral responsibility, just as being a mother implies moral responsibility to her infant child. Thus Rexroth claims that "being is / Responsibility .../.../ Ontology is ethical" (2002: 361). One cannot sepa- rate his philosophy of nature from his ethics or politics, because ethical and political relations are part of reality itself.</page><page sequence="12">12 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 Politics is natural in another sense: it arises out of our own nature as it experiences reality in contemplation. As the essential spiritual praxis for Rexroth, contemplation is inextricably linked to love, as if the two constitute the breath of the spirit: "What is taken in / In contemplation is poured out / In love" (2002: 390). Love is the primary, spontaneous response of our inter- relatedness within the community of love. Responsibility is not based on duty or rational calculation. Out of its very nature, love spontaneously yields a profound sense of responsibility to others. And for Rexroth, responsibility is by its very nature a disposition to act for the well-being of others, which involves political critique and resistance as well the drive for a political ideal. A community of love is A community of mutual Indwelling, in which each member Realizes his total Liability for the whole. The healthy organism Itself, responds instantly, As a whole, to the injury To the slightest of its parts (2002: 481). We are all individuals within a community, and political action is the natural response of one part of that whole to harm (e.g., social injustice or environ- mental ruin) done to other parts. It is a natural response both because it is our individual nature to do so and because we are part of a whole. The individual s political action is the act of the whole responding for the sake of the harmed part and thus for the sake of the whole.20 This commitment to political involvement is directly linked to his critique: the analysis of what is wrong, why, and how bad the situation is. Despite writ- ing before the birth of the modern environmentalist movement in the 1960s, he was sensitive to the ecological degradation around him. In a collection of poetry published in 1940, In What Hour , he writes "Thirty factories empty their refuse in the creek. / The farm has given way to an impoverished suburb / On the parched lawns are starlings, alien and aggressive" (2002: 171). In the 1950s, he wrote a poem in the form of an open letter to William Carlos 20) In articulating his notion of community and wholeness, Rexroth uses two types of language: that of a community of individuals and that of a single whole. However, this rhetoric does not necessarily imply two mutually exclusive perspectives. See Barnhill 2001 for an analysis of "relational holism," a type of holism that retains the integrity of the individual and relationships.</page><page sequence="13">D.L.

"Its a wonderful quiet / You have, a way of keeping / Still about the world, and its / Dirty rivers, and gar- bage cans. . ." (2002: 292). Later in the poem he imagines a Utopian future in which a mother and her children live in "an idyllic / News from Nowhere sort of landscape". The mother informs her children about the past, now barely imaginable, when the Passaic "was filthy / With the poisonous excrements / Of sick men and factories" (2002: 293).21 Such environmental critiques by Rexroth, however, were relatively rare before the 1960s and 70s, when he began to speak out in strong support for the environmental movement. Particularly in columns written for the local press, he railed against the degradation that was becoming more extensive and more apparent. Some of his comments were remarkably prescient. In 1969, long before the debate about global warming, he proclaimed, "The carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere can no longer be kept in balance. . .". And his analysis of the loss of biodiversity - a radical statement in his time - is now an accepted view: "The things we are doing to our environment are changing it far more drastically than the changes necessary to account for the extinction of the great reptiles at the end of the Jurassic Age and incomparably more quickly" (1969). One key aspect of his environmental critique is the link with his more complex and extensive social criticism. Environmental and social problems are associated in large part because both involve a lack of true and healthy community. The present relation of man to his environment and man to man has become so unlike the optimum necessary for the evolution of the species that humanity as we know it cannot endure. In such a situation a demand for readjustment is as instinctive as the reaction of an invertebrate animal subject to electric shock. This is what all the schools and tendencies of the libertarian and communal tradition have in common, a primary emphasis on man as a member of an organic community, a biota, in creative, non-exploitative relationship with his fellows and his environment (1974: xiii). In the prefaces to two of his poetry collections, he puts his social critique starkly: we live in a time "when the world is mortally ill" (1953: n.p.) and in "a society which grows daily more depraved and destructive" (1956: n.p.). 21) Gibson notes that his nature poems (as well as his love poems) "become criticisms of dehu- manized culture based on the alienation of people from one another, from their own nature, and from the universe as a whole" (1986:36). Put differently, the organic worldview articulated in his poetry is in itself a critique of a society that fails to realize - that actively works against - an organic worldview.</page><page sequence="14">14 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 He often puts this in terms of death. A society may die but may "last, massive and sterile and affluent, like a golden mummy, for centuries. . ." (1965). More frequently, he uses the rhetoric of "the murderous dominant society" (1961: 185). His poetry is filled with references to society murdering its citizens, extinguishing human vitality and leaving people as lifeless servants of the state and economy. His fullest and most famous declaration of social murder is "Thou Shalt Not Kill," a long, enraged protest instigated by the death of poet Dylan Thomas. As Donald Gutierrez has put it, "the implication is that he, all young and creative life, is killed by the general corruption and death- orientation of modern society - the gross, accumulative misuse of power by large corporations, science put to destructive ends, universities prostituting the ideals of learning, the lies and distortions of the mass media, the selling- out of writers like Hemingway" (1996b: 36). 22 This death is characterized in part by the atomization of individuals, the antithesis of the community of love: "each person is reduced to an atomic individual in perpetual conflict with other individuals" (Gibson 1986: 71). People end up in "the isolation of / The ego, not being, hate, / Ultimate atomi- zation" (Rexroth 2002: 444). The social parallel to this is collectivity - the aggregation of isolated individuals that serve as instrumentalities of the State (2002: 462). Despite involving a social grouping, such a collectivity reinforces human alienation, "the radical divorce of man from his work, men from one another, and man from himself" (1968b) - and people from the natural world. By presenting an organic worldview in his poetry, that poetry becomes, as Gibson argues, a criticism "of a dehumanized culture based on the alienation of people from one another, from their own nature, and from the universe as a whole" (1986: 36). Rage in poetry, even in environmental critique, often makes the reader uncomfortable. But as Michael P. Branch has pointed out, "anger is a primary engine of cultural change and ... it has often proven an indispensable tool in the service of social justice," and, he continues, "there is in fact deep precedent for the importance and value of anger in American art." Branch defends anger in the nature writing of the American essayist and novelist Rick Bass, and what Branch says about the location of rage within in that writers affective complex is true of Rexroth as well: "At the heart of Basss elegiac art is advo- cacy; at the core of his advocacy, anger; at the source of his anger, grief; at the root of his grief, love" (Branch 2001: 231, 232, 242). 22) For a particularly important critical analysis of Rexroths critique of society, see Knabb 1 990, especially chapter three.</page><page sequence="15">D.I. Barnhill /Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 1 5 Why has this dystopian situation come about? Rexroth has rwo main answers. The first is capitalism, in particular the cash nexus and the commodi- fication of life. "The sudden popularity of ecology," he argues, "is not a craze. It is the response to the deadly crisis caused by a craze called the profit system" (1969). The profit system is for him inextricably tied to atomization and alien- ation: capitalism creates "the completely atomic / Individuality and the pure / Commodity relationship. . ." (2002: 258). But a critique of capitalism is by itself insufficient. For Rexroth, the second and more fundamental source of our current dystopia is the nation-state and all other authoritarian, hierarchi- cal institutions, a view that reveals his anarchist perspective.23 "The State is the organization / Of the evil instincts of mankind" (2002: 250), he asserts, and it "is ruled by venality, covetousness, fraud, vulgarity. . ." (1969: 47). It is also inherently violent and repressive, and he cites and then goes beyond Randolph Bournes (1886-1918) famous coupling of the nation-state and war: "war is the health of the state."24 War is the health of the State? Indeed! War is the State. All personal Anti-institutional values Must be burnt out of each generation (2002: 251). All of these facts are as true of state socialism as of the capitalist state. As Ken Knabb has noted, The failures of Bolshevism and reformist socialism to bring about a truly radical social change confirmed Rexroths anarchism. It had become more evident than ever that capitalism cannot be eliminated by state programs and that any state bureaucracy, no matter how supposedly radical, naturally tends to perpetuate its own power (1990: 53). But though Rexroth is quick to criticize Bolshevism, he is more concerned with the oppressive state in capitalism. "Capitalism and the / State have become identical" (2002: 446), he proclaims, and they work together like a two- headed monster that depersonalizes and quantifies individuals (2002: 444). 23 23) Anarchism here refers not to those who use violence to create chaos in society, but a sophis- ticated philosophical tradition and complex social movement over the past 200 years. For a review of the history, ideas, and values of anarchism, see Marshall 1992. 2A) Randolph Bourne was an American critic of the nation-state who opposed the entry of the United States into World War I. He died of the great Spanish influenza pandemic before the publication of his most famous essay, "The State," in which he proclaimed that "war is the health of the state." 25) Rexroths critique of both capitalism and the nation-state, combined with his intense concern with the natural world, link him to ecosocialism and in particular social ecology,</page><page sequence="16">16 D.L. Barnhill / Worläviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 Rexroths perspective will strike some readers as excessive, but it is worth keeping in mind a comment offered by ecocritic Lawrence Buell, that environ- mentalism (and I would add the struggle for social justice) "cannot hope to achieve even modest reforms unless some take extreme positions advocating genuinely alternative paths: rejection of consumer society, communitarian anti-modernism, animal liberation" (Buell 2001: 7, italics in original). Rexroths political critique is articulated powerfully in some early poems recalling activists around the world. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of these political poems is that they are also beautiful nature poems. Nature, particularly mountains, serves as a kind of pristine location that enables the sharpest re-imagining of those fighting for justice and liberty. "From the Paris Commune to the Kronstadt Rebellion" (2002: 143-44), for instance, medi- tates on the anarchists and other radicals who briefly took control of Paris in 1871, as well as the Kronstadt sailors, whose uprising for a libertarian com- munism against Lenins dictatorship was crushed in 1921. The poem begins with these lines: Remember now there were others before this; Now when the unwanted hours rise up, And the sun rises red in unknown quarters, And the constellations change places, And cloudless thunder erases the furrows, And moonlight stains and the stars grow hot. The natural world is the context for both heroic resistance and its memory. But in Rexroths organic philosophy, nature is not simply a setting for polit- ical memory, it is that within which politics ultimately resides. The sense of nature encompassing the social is intensified by his references of mountains, vast and distant from society, and the constellations, which arc in orderly pro- gression over the machinations of man. In "Requiem for the Spanish Dead" (2002: 148-49), he envisions the anarchists and other radicals who battled both the fascists and the Stalinists, and he frames them in the immense still- ness of mountains and stars. The great geometrical winter constellations Lift up over the Sierra Nevada, I walk under the stars, my feet on the known round earth. ... I see Spain which is highly influenced by the anarchist tradition. For representative studies, see Pepper 1993 and Light 1998.</page><page sequence="17">D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 1 7 Under the black windy sky, the snow stirring faintly, Glittering and moving over the pallid upland, And men waiting, clutched with cold and huddled together, As an unknown plane goes over them. It flies southeast Into the haze above the lines of the enemy, Sparks appear near the horizon under it. After they have gone out the earth quivers And the sound comes faintly. The men relax for a moment And grow tense again as their own thoughts return to them. Orion moves westward across the meridian, Rigel, Bellatrix, Betelgeuse, marching in order, The great nebula glimmering in his loins. Rexroth was particularly moved by the deaths of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, who were executed in 1927 for a murder they did not commit. In "Climbing Milestone Mountain, August 22, 1937" (2002: 151-52), their memory slowly rises while he is spending weeks with his wife in the California mountains. For a month now, wandering over the Sierras, A poem had been gathering in my mind, Details of significance and rhythm, The way poems do, but still lacking a focus. Last night I remembered the date and it all Began to grow together and take on purpose. We sat up late while Deneb moved over the zenith And I told Marie all about Boston, how it looked That last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping Impotent in the streets that last midnight. I told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands, How America was forever a different place Afterwards for many. The poem ends with Rexroth imagining a future in which politics and nature fuse with mountains named after these two victims of injustice. Rexroths combination of the strong elegiac tone of these poems with the jeremiad-like excoriations of contemporary society reflects what Branch has called "elegiad," which he sees as "central to the legitimate literary ambitions of nature writers" (2001:244). In these poems, Rexroths political reverie arises within a specific place in nature, while the reverie takes him and the reader to other places. While a "sense of place" is usually associated with one particular locale, recently critics have suggested that place can have a more complex valence. In commenting on Caribbean poet Derek Walcotts epic Omeros , Buell argues that it "bears</page><page sequence="18">18 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 out the possibility of imagining placeness in multi-scalar terms: local, national, regional, transhemispheric; topographically, historically, culturally" (Buell 2005: 96). In his political nature poems, Rexroth engages in a sense of place that focuses not only on the Sierras he knows so well but also places on the other coast of the United States and across the Atlantic ocean, and he demon- strates how a multi-scalar sense of place can be defined not only historically and culturally but politically as well. This integration of politics into nature is also seen in more general and contemporary reflections of human society and its place within the natural world. In "Night Below Zero" (2002: 211), the narrator is skiing in the Sierra Mountains deep into the night, and then casts a unifying gaze at a troubled world embraced by cosmic clarity and stillness. I stop at the canyons edge, stand looking out Over the Great Valley, over the millions - In bed, drunk, loving, tending mills, furnaces, Alone, wakeful, as the world rolls in chaos. The quarter moon rises in the black heavens - Over the sharp constellations of the cities The cold lies, crystalline and silent, Locked between the mountains. After the end of World War II, however, there were fewer overtly political poems. In fact, Rexroth admits that he lost "revolutionary hope," expressed most incisively in a 1952 poem "For Eli Jacobson" (2002: 541-42). There are few of us now, soon There will be none. We were comrades Together, we believed we Would see with our own eyes the new World where man was no longer Wolf to man, but men and women Were all brothers and lovers Together. We will not see it. After a few lines expressing faint hope of a now distant Utopian future, Rexroth concludes the poem with these lines: "If the good days never come, / We will not know. We will not care. / Our lives were the best. We were the / Happiest men alive in our day". Gutierrez perceptively notes that this political despair is linked to his ongoing vision of a natural harmony. [L]ooked at in the larger context of Rexroths political verse from the 1930s to the end of the 1 950s, the disparity between natural order and human disorder, as it increases, intimates a growing tragic irony, for modern humanity seems less and</page><page sequence="19">D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 1 9 less in control of even minimal survival. And in his prose writings from the 1960s on, the despair even in survival augments, ending in an apocalyptic vision of global doom (1996a: 164). 26 The rhetoric of apocalypse, of course, is not uncommon in environmental analyses, but Rexroth extends that to include the social dimension as well. Greg Garrard summarizes tragic apocalyptic rhetoric in a way that describes some of Rexroths passages. "The warning is presented in terms of absolute author- ity; the material threat is evil,' and so, by association, are the authors of it; the consequences of failure to heed the warning are catastrophic, and the danger is not only imminent, but already well underway" (Garrard 2004: 95). The loss of revolutionary hope resulted in part from the steady and largely successful repression of anarchism and other radical political groups in the twentieth century combined with the seemingly invincible rise of "clean and prosperous evil" of post-war America. In the Eli Jacobson poem, Rexroth laments that In our young days we believed That as we grew old and fell Out of rank, new recruits, young And with the wisdom of youth, Would take our places and they Surely would grow old in the Golden Age. They have not come. They will not come. This passage concerning the absence of new recruits is striking because four years later Rexroth would become an important figure in rise to prominence of the Beats and the counter culture. Though he was quick to criticize the indulgences of the Beats, he recognized substantial resistance in certain seg- ments of the "youth revolt" and in the civil rights and environmental move- ments that 1960s. However, as this resistance became increasingly strong, he published no poems of protest. Gibson asks why, and he cogently answers, "Perhaps rebellion could not defeat the 'Social Lie,' against which he had said all that he could say, or so he thought. Moreover, he had come to the tragic conclusion that those who rule the world would destroy it through ecological catastrophe or nuclear war" (1986: 22-23). 26) As this quotation suggests, starting in the 1960s, Rexroth increasingly articulated his political critique in his prose writings. His poetry became more focused on the spiritual realization of value, particularly in nature.</page><page sequence="20">20 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 Despite the loss of revolutionary hope, however, Rexroth saw the value of resistance to be in the virtue of the struggle itself. In the essay "The Students Take Over," he states, "Myself, past fifty, I cannot speak for the young. I am inclined to think they will fail. But that isn't the point. . . . Virtue, they say, in itself is intrinsically enjoyable. You can lose nothing, then, by striking back" (1961 : 102). And while Rexroth pulled away from direct resistance, he identi- fied other avenues of subverting the hegemonic state. One is poetry, which he considered to be the symbolic criticism of values. Putting this political func- tion of verse as blunting as he could, he asserted in the second preface to The Art of Worldly Wisdom that "My poems are acts of force and violence directed against the evil which murders us all. If you like, they are designed not just to overthrow the present State, economic systems, and Church, but all prevail- ing systems of human collectivity altogether" (1953: n.p.). But this does not mean that the poet should concern himself with detailed political analysis. As Lee Bartlett has pointed out, for Rexroth "The poet certainly has a political responsibility, but the communication poets offer which remains of interest is not programmatic. . ." (1989: 5). Rather, true art is by itself revolutionary. "If you really do the things the academic nitwits persuade others and some- times themselves they are doing, your poetry will be quite adequately revolu- tionary. If you write like the Great Dead, you will expose and destroy the pretensions of theTrivial Living. Homer is as fully revolutionary as Mayakofsky" (1953: n.p.). Rexroth's Ideal: The Integral Person and Communitarian Anarchism If we live in an organically interrelated world but in a society made of alienated individuals, what is the ideal? At the individual level, the most characteristic term Rexroth uses is the integral person. Especially in his earlier writings, he uses the term autonomy in a positive way and spoke of the "self-determining person" (2002: 266). Such language might suggest a kind of individualism that goes contrary to a communitarian perspective. But this ideal does not entail atomistic individualism, which Rexroth associates with the commodity relationship of capitalism (2002: 258). The integrity of the person is found in its organic integration with the rest of the world. Rexroth summarizes this dialectic between individuality and sociality by distinguishing it from both individualism and collectivism: "Individualism understands only a part of man, collectivism understands man only as a part" (1959: 131). Put in more positive terms, the ideal is a "high degree of both autonomy and community" (1991: 525).</page><page sequence="21">D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 21 There is a dialectic also in the process of achieving true personhood: this ultimate achievement is done by what is paradoxically "the simplest act" which is "the self unselfing itself, the only act that is actual act". It is an unselfing in that the person transcends the limits of the atomistic, individual self by achiev- ing "the supernatural identification of the self with the tragic unity of creative process" and assuming unlimited liability for the entire world. This ideal is an unselfing also in how it is accomplished. "I hope I have made it clear that the self does not do this by an act of will, by sheer assertion. He who would save his life must lose it" (1968a: iii). Thus the integral self is actualized by rejecting the atomistic self and realizing ones essential relation to all: "the person is real / Only in community" (2002: 457). At the social level, this communitarian view of the self and its unlimited sense of responsibility is linked to anarchism. The ideal of classical anarchists, he states, was "not a matter of seizing power, but of doing away with power and returning society to an organic community of non-coercive human rela- tions. They believed that this was what society was naturally. . ." (1974: ix).27 Order is not created by an authoritarian, hierarchical State - indeed such a State inherently creates disorder by its oppressiveness. True order arises only when people are free - free to be responsible and to interact with mutual aid. Unlimited liability is communistic in the ideal of the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin28 (1842-1921): everyone contributes what they can and takes (only) what they need. Although as an explicit philosophy, anarchism is only around two hundred years old, Rexroth, like many other anarchist thinkers, looks to the past for examples of anarchism in action. He interprets the ideal of Socrates as reso- nant with communitarian anarchism, an "ever-expanding freedom of morally autonomous but co-operating persons, who together made up a community whose characteristic aim was an organically growing depth, breadth, intensity of experience. . . " (CR 72). He also suggests that there is a strong relation between the anarchist ideal and radical religious communities, including the 27) Actually, there has been a wide range of views in the anarchist tradition concerning commu- nity, including a highly individualistic, non-organic view first championed by Max Stirner, with the Libertarian Party in the United States one type of descendent. For a study of Stimers anar- chism, see Clark 1976. 28) Rexroth invokes Kropotkins communitarian ideal in praising Gary Snyder: "Out of the great forests of the Pacific Northwest, out of the communal tradition of the I.W.W. and Kropotkins Mutual Aid , Gary Snyder was the poetic voice of the ecological revolution twelve years before anybody else had ever heard the term" (1972 175). For a study of Kropotkins life and thought, see Woodcock and Avakumovic 1 97 1 .</page><page sequence="22">22 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 tradition of "[l]ay monasticism, a community of families holding all things in common, living a life modeled on that of the apostles. . (1974: 30). In mak- ing these links to the past, he is establishing that the anarchist ideal is part of long-standing tradition, which, he says, goes back to the Israelites in the Book of Judges and the Neolithic village (1974: 1-8, 149). In his survey of communalist societies, Rexroth is particularly apprecia- tive of Gerrard Winstanley (1609-76) and the Diggers, in part because of the significant role of nature in that social and spiritual ideal.29 "This vision came not as a command from on high," Rexroth claims, "but as a voice open- ing out of the experience of nature itself," and he quotes Winstanley s rejection of an anthropomorphic deity set over against and independent of nature. In fact, according to Winstanley, nature is where we find God: "To know the secrets of nature, is to know the works of God; and to know the works of God within the creation, is to know God himself, for God dwells in every vis- ible work or body". A society in harmony with what Winstanley called the Reason of nature would be fully communistic. Such a view, Rexroth argues, "was not an economic doctrine, but mutual aid followed from his organic philosophy as a logical consequence" (1974: 146), which is true of Rexroths view as well. Rexroth did not confine himself to summarizing the ideals of past com- munities. In some of his essays and interviews he points to the ideals of the contemporary counterculture, which Rexroth presents as surpassing tradi- tional anarchism (with its symbolic black flag) by incorporating more fully ecological concerns and insights. Out of the great forests of the Pacific Northwest, out of the communal tradition of the I.W.W. and Kropotkins Mutual Aid&gt; Gary Snyder was the poetic voice of the ecological revolution. . . . [T]he youth revolt, the alternative society, has raised the slogan, 'Down with the Red Flag! Down with the Black Flag! Up with the Green!* It is not surprising that Snyder and Whalen . . . have become, as poets, the most influential spokesmen, or even ideologists, of a new and revolutionary system of values, based on a constant, prayerful sense of the interlocking responsibilities of the community of all life on earth (1961: 175). 30 In 1649, Winstanley formed a group he called the True Levellers, but the group is also known as the Diggers. The group sought to establish small-scale egalitarian agrarian communities as the way to embody their communistic form of Christianity. For a study of Winstanley, see Shulman 1989. 30) The International Workers of the World (I.W.W.) is a radical labor organization founded in 1905. It peaked in popularity and influence in 1923, and though it has only a few thousand members today, it remains emblematic of an anarchist-informed labor movement.</page><page sequence="23">D.L Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 23 Rexroth terms this ideal a "society of ecological Bodhisattvas" characterized by mutual aid and respect for life, full awareness of ones place in the community of creatures" (1961: 185). 31 The goal is to "live a balanced life of mutual aid, of symbiosis with all the other creatures on earth. . . He concludes that "[i]f we can achieve an ecological morality we will have achieved a community based on Kropotkins Mutual Aid, and Schweitzers respect for life, and at the same time a spiritual morality and a community ethic. . (1961: 185-86). 32 Our Own Eternity Despite his communitarian perspective and political commitment, starting in the 1950s Rexroths loss of revolutionary hope led him to focus his poetry more on personal experience. For him, the United States in the 1950s, as a military superpower and the major force behind the a rapidly accelerating consumer capitalism, had created a hegemony that could not be overcome, only opted out of. In the preface to his 1950 poetry collection, The Signature of All Things , he notes that there are no long poems in the collection, and adds that, Neither are there any poems to heroes and martyrs of social conflict this time, and few direcdy socially critical or exhortative poems. These are all simple, personal poems, as close as I can make them to integral experience. Perhaps the integral person is more revolutionary than any program, party, or social conflict. At least I have come to think so. And I have little doubt but that he - the irreducible man - is the great enemy of the fools and rascals who are destroying the world (1950: 9). Rexroth comes to associate heroic resistance with youth. In "The Empty Mirror" (1952), the narrator is dwelling in a "ten foot square hut". Gazing into a fire, he muses, Once I saw fire cities, Towns, palaces, wars, Heroic adventures, In the campii res of youth. Now I see only fire (2002: 321). 31) More recently the term "ecosattva" has come into use. For studies of Buddhism and ecology, see Tucker and Williams 1998 and Kaza and Kraft 2000. 32) Rexroth held the German Nobel Peace Prize winner Schweitzer (1875-1965) in high regard for a life of compassion dedicated to serving others. He listed him along with Buber, Kropotkin, and others as representatives of the "religious anarchism" he espoused (1950 9-10).</page><page sequence="24">24 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 This is not an admission of failure but rather an assertion of achievement, the realization of what Rexroth considered a more mature and mystical vision in line with Buddhisms ideal of direct perception of reality as it is. The title of the verse alludes to the Buddhist ideal of enlightened consciousness in the selfs delusions and desires are cleared away and reality is experienced purely and directly. The poem ends with symbols of transformation: "On the table lies a cast / Snake skin and an uncut stone" (2002: 32 1).33 But while Rexroths later poetry was focused on personal spiritual cultiva- tion, his political perspective did not change. In a poem written in Venice (published in 1964), the narrator listens to monks singing vespers on May Day (associated with both pagan rituals and radical labor activism). He reflects on his close relationship with his little daughter and recalls another May Day with his daughter when overhead "dive bombers wrote / Monograms of death in the sky". In the present moment, he listens to a military jet that "breaks the sound barrier / With a shuddering belch of hate," and he declares that "shave jowled apes" in corporate board rooms "are pushing all this pretty / Planet nearer and nearer to / Total death. Nothing can stop them". But within that loss of hope and against the apocalyptic movement of history, he believes, one can work to become an integral person and cultivate a pro- found realization of an organic spirituality. The poem ends with him telling his daughter "we have our own / Eternity, so fleeting that they / Can never touch it, or even / Know that it has passed them by" (2002: 617-618). His poetry from 1967 to 1979 presents many such momentary eternities, and political references largely disappear. Care for all of life, however, remains, albeit in a different form. The Heart's Garden , The Gardens Heart evokes the Buddhist ideal of the bodhisattva, "He who hears / The crying of all the worlds" and whose vow is "I will not enter Nirvana / Until all sentient crea- tures are saved" (2002: 669). But as in traditional Buddhism, that compassion has no apparent link to the concrete, political context. With justification, Ken Knabb (1990) has criticized Rexroths decreased political involvement and the 33) In East Asian religion and aesthetics, a mirror is a symbol of the clear mind that reflects things as they are. Empty is not only a term for Buddhist ultimate reality (this world rightly seen, empty of isolated "thingness" and characterized by interpénétration) but is also a character- istic of the enlightened state of mind, empty of preconceived notions and attachments and thus able to perceive directly. Uncut stone alludes to the Oaoist ideal of the uncarved block, which is not chiseled and shaped by society or personal desires but is its natural self. Ten foot square hut is a term used in classical Japanese literature for the dwelling place of a solitary monk or poet. One of the most famous literary essays in that tradition is Hõjõki , literally "ten foot square hut".</page><page sequence="25">D. L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (201 1) 1-28 2 5 compromises and contradictions in his later political thought.34 Rexroth also failed to make the connection between Buddhism and social activism that is found in engaged Buddhism, which began to take shape in the U.S. in the 1970s (see Queen 2000 and King 2009). His late poetry also lacks the sense of a possible communitarian society, which can be found in some forms of bioregionalism, a movement that started in the 1970s.35 However, despite this shift in his poetry, it is too simplistic to claim that Rexroth became apolitical or that he lost any vision of a social ideal. There was a kind of division of labor in his writings starting in the 1960s. From 1960 to 1975, Rexroth wrote columns first for the San Francisco Examiner and then the San Francisco Magazine. While his poetry became more focused on the personal experience of his organic spirituality, he continued his social commentary (and his basic political stance) as a journalist. In addition, in 1974 he published Communalism : From Its Origins to the Twentieth Century. In this important work, he analyzes the long tradition of communitarian societies. In doing so he indirectly articulates his own communalist ideals and his general sense of what is possible and what is required in a libertarian community. Throughout his writings, Rexroths overall worldview remained organic. His vision continued to be one in which nature is a sacred community, a dynamic web of relationships of which humans are a part. The complexity of that spirituality, according to Geoffrey Gardner, is such that Rexroth was "the most accomplished and deepest religious poet to write in this country since Whitman" (1980: xi). Perhaps the most important legacy of his nature spiri- tuality was its integration with politics and ethics. Contemplation informed by both Catholicism and Buddhism was joined by his ongoing critique of an alienating society and his promotion of a communitarian ideal. Mystical vision and ethical commitment formed a unity that yielded the profoundest of fruits. [Illumination comes as the crown of a life of intense ethical activism, of honesty, loyalty, poverty, chastity, and above all charity, positive, out-going love of all creatures. The good life creates the ambience into which spiritual illumination flows like a sourceless, totally diffused light (1964). For a criticism of Knabbs critique, see Moore 1 993. ni Bioregionalism seeks to ground individual lifestyles and societies in the specific character of the local biogeographic region. For a writer who has developed both socially engaged Buddhism and bioregionalism, see the works of Gary Snyder. For overviews of bioregionalism, see Carr 2004, McGinnis 1998, and Sale 1985.</page><page sequence="26">26 D.L. Barnhill / Worldviews 15 (2011) 1-28 References Allen, Donald, ed. 1960.
