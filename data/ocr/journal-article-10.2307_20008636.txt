ISBN 0199269823. Paul Gavrilyuk (hereafter G.) is an assistant professor of historical theology at the University of St Thomas, St Paul. The present book is a modified version of his Ph.D. thesis; part of a chapter of it has been published elsewhere before. It is a well-written and tightly argued study, and it pursues a double agenda. One part of this is made explicit throughout, the other is implicit. The explicit stated agenda is to refute the notion, still widespread in modern ('Western') systematic theology, that the classic (Patristic) concept of divine impassibility, rather than being based on the biblical notion of God's transcendence, is in fact a distorting innovation influenced by 'Hellenistic philosophy', the result of a 'Hellenization process' that has alienated Christianity from its biblical roots. In chapters i and 2, G. forcefully and persuasively takes on this argument. In chapter 1 (21-46) he makes 'the case against the theory of theology's fall into Hellenistic philosophy'. He points out that there is no single 'Hellenistic philosophy', but a plural diversity of philosophies, and that Epicureanism, the only school which held a concept perhaps similar to that which modern 'passibilists' reject, namely divine impassibility as a form of disinterested detachment from human affairs, was universally rejected in antiquity. Since the Stoics were the most vociferous critics of the Epicureans, it remains an open and even today much-debated question as to what they meant by apatheia,</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 117 or by 'God' for that matter, whether they ever attributed the former to the latter, and how they perceived divine impassibility. Their concept of divine providence (pronoia) might provide an indication. If there is one concept that unites all Hellenistic philosophers (except the outlawed Epicureans) then it is that 'God cares'; and in order for God to be able to care effectively, He must not be suffering from debilitating and distracting passions and emotions. This is why Hellenistic philosophers famously either polemicized against mythical and cultic 'theologies' with their anthropomorphic, morbid, and corrupt, deities, or they allegorized. The biblical God too is, generally speaking, 'not subject to mindless and capricious rage' (37). As G. elegantly demonstrates, comparing Hebrew and Septuagint parallel passages, the biblical concept of God that lies at the basis of both Judaism and Christianity is itself Hellenistic, though at this point G. himself becomes slightly confused in his use of the term 'Hellenism'. The 'Hellenistic influence on the development of pre-Christian Judaism' of which G. speaks (41) is not entirely 'external', as G. states, but largely identical with that development. The Septuagint, the Bible of Greek Christianity, is a Hellenistic achievement. At this crucial point (at the end of chapter i) G.'s more implicit agenda comes to the fore. Chapter 2 (47-63) is entitled 'The Christian God vs passionate pagan deities'. In it G. develops the concept of 'impassibility as an apophatic qualifier of divine emotions'. He now switches from a comparative 'history of ideas' to a 'systematic theology' mode. This has severe implications for his treatment of the Patristic material with which he works. 'Hellenistic' is not what G. would want to call either Judaism or Christianity, despite the overwhelming evidence presented in chapter i. He reserves the term for the philosophies and religions of 'pagan' antiquity. Christianity, in his view so it seems, works with entirely new concepts, or should one say it operates in a completely new paradigm. But it is, of course, G. himself who, in his interpretation of the phenomenon, constructs the latter. Judaism, by the way, does not enter into G.'s equation. This naturally affects his discussion of first- and second-century Christianity, which as a consequence is rather sketchy. G. presents the early Christian concept of 'divine impassibility' as 'an apophatic qualifier of divine emotions' (60). 'Apophatic' here seems to stand for the idea that anything said about God on the level of creation refers to God inadequately rather than adequately, but not because God is inadequate in relation to creation, but because creation is inadequate in relation to God. Within this framework, the purpose of the concept of divine impassibility is not to forestall 'any meaningful discourse about divine emotions' (62), but to put such a discourse in perspective. For G. to talk of divine emotions is precisely not to equate divine suffering with human suffering, as if the notion that God is equally miserable in His suffering as human beings are could be of any consolation to suffering human beings. Rather, divine suffering must be seen</page><page sequence="3">18 Book reviews in the context of the economy of salvation. Faith in God, hope in victory, and love that overcomes suffering - such attitudes only make sense if it is the omnipotent, transcendent, impassible God who suffers, in such a way that suffering (like evil itself) has no chance of succeeding. This approach is obviously systematic, as is G.'s account of 'the dialectics of Patristic thought' indicated in the subtitle. G. does not account for this approach. Rather he seems to assume that his readers should take it for granted. He does not account for the fact that, like Hellenistic thought, Patristic thought is extremely diverse and cannot be reduced to a hailstorm of -isms (Docetism, Patripassianism, Arianism, Nestorianism, and many others in between) each rejected and refuted in some detail until pure orthodoxy finds itself in the thought of Cyril of Alexandria (151-175). No doubt Cyril's theology is admirable for its elegance and coherence. In fact, G. might have done it more justice had he given it more space and studied it more in its own right, rather than as part of an a-historical, 'dialectic', history of the concept of divine impassibility in Patristic thought. The problem is not that G. refutes the 'theory of theology's fall into Hellenistic philosophy' (172). He does so quite rightly, though it has been done before (e.g. by Charles Stead, of whose work in this area G. could have taken more notice). The problem is that G. does so with systematic preconceptions that generate an image of 'the gradual development of the doctrine of the incarnation in the Patristic period' of such 'remarkable logical elegance' (172) that it would have impressed Hegel. Once, when challenged that his philosophy bears little resem blance to historical reality, Hegel is supposed to have retorted, 'too bad for reality'. G.'s account too is a pleasure to read as long as one does not look too closely at historical and philological details. This begins with bibliographical references. The reviewer apologises for being so nit-picking, but this seems symptomatic. Several modern authors are listed under the 'ancient authors' section (180-182), most prominently Luise Abramowski (between Pierre Abelard and Aeschylus). Translations and editions of ancient works are randomly thrown together. Some references are incomplete and consequently quite useless, others misleading in the sense that they refer to outdated editions or translations, or simply to volume numbers of Migne's Patrologiae. In the 'modern authors' section (183-196) the use of initials alter nates with that of full first names, and many surnames are misspelled: Crouzel, De Labriolle, Jouassard, Heschel (176), Pierre Nautin (191). These are just minutiae picked up by browsing through the pages. What would someone find who went looking for it? The problem is, of course, more profound. In its pursuit of a systematic point this study lacks concern for historical context or philological accuracy. From time to time G. does acknowledge that. Thus, after having used the term 'Docetism' for several pages and vaguely defined it in systematic terms,</page><page sequence="4">Book reviews 119 G. comes to admit: 'The origins of Docetic beliefs in Christianity are obscure' (80). He then vaguely hints at 'early Christian Gnostics', 'Graeco-Oriental speculation' and 'heterodox Jewish sectarian thought', but fails to admit who precisely held 'Docetic' views and above all, why (apart from the external and not quite convincing argument that Docetists may have tried to please or appease pagan sensibilites). In G.'s view such details depend 'upon the ingenuity of a given Docetic group' (80-81). The 'Gnostics' are treated in a similar manner. They are defined from the perspective of anti-Gnostic writers (81 n.63), though they are treated sympath etically: They 'left us the most daring flights of speculative fancy' and 'tested the logical limits of the language of negative theology' (83). But their concept of divine impassibility (implicating Christ) was rejected by the Church Fathers (84), and that is what matters. G. also has doubts about 'Patripassianism'. Citing Harnack he asks 'whether the formula Pater passus est was ever deployed by any Patripassian' (93). He then cites as an example Noetus, as cited in Hippolytus' Contra Noetum, 2.3, who indeed seems to have used the phrase, but with the qualification that 'Christ is the Father'. Is this a 'straightforward affirmation of the point that the Father, who is truly God, was the subject of the sufferings of Christ' (93), or does it not rather raise the question, as G. himself admits only a page further on, of how Noetus thought of the relationship between Father and Son? Significantly, as again G. himself points out, Hippolytus nowhere explicitly attacks Noetus' claim that God suffered' (94). The pattern is repeated in chapter 5 on 'Arianism'. G. deals with five in terpretations of how and why it may have originated (105-114), but not with the questions of what it is and how it compares with Arius' own teaching (106), the Homoean position (1og), or Eunomius' teaching (117-121), three quite different phenomena. G. reduces them roughly to the position that they were against the homoousios because for them it had a materialist (116) and Patripassianist (123-124) ring. Yet again, this was how their opponents defined them, e.g. Gregory of Nyssa in his Contra Eunomium. G. cites him at length to underline his point. But Gregory responds to a very specific position and he points out in his opening remark that his opponent does not deny 'the economy of the passion', but only argues that the impassibility of the Father does not admit the Father's involvement in the Son's passion (131). Prima facie quite a sensible anti-patripassian argument which, with some subtle distinctions, might even be sustained in an orthodox context. Finally, on Nestorianism and Cyril of Alexandria, G. rightly rejects approaches which are overly focused on the alleged ambiguities of Cyril's character, or on deep-running differences between the theological traditions (often referred to as schools) of Alexandria and Antioch. 'Schools', G. thinks, is perhaps not the right word here, especially for Antioch (although John McGuckin has recently revived the term 'school' in a slightly different context, referring to all those</page><page sequence="5">120 Book reviews thinkers who, in the wake of Origen and depending upon each other, formed what emerged as the Greek Orthodox theological tradition. This includes thinkers like the Cappadocians and Cyril of Alexandria, and excludes not just those linked to positions considered heretical by those included, but also those not directly or immediately relevant for the emergence of the tradition in question, like Irenaeus or Hippolytus. G. seems to edge towards a similar kind of approach, but he is not explicit, and perhaps also not entirely aware of it). At any rate, G.'s presen tation of 'Nestorian' positions, be it Nestorius' own position or that of Theodore of Mopsuestia, suffers from the same lack of differentiation as those of earlier positions. For G., as far as divine impassibility is concerned, Arianism and Nestorianism are quite similar (141-144): They carry impassibilism too far. Is it disingenuous to say that it almost seems as if, for G., they are not Patripassian enough, or that they are even anti-Patripassian, as is shown by the Oriental churches' charge against Cyril of defending theopatheia (144-151)? True, Cyril's own approach is genial and true; it cannot be reduced to the wrongheaded 'theory of theology's fall into Hellenistic philosophy' (149). But is Theodore's and Nestorius' position on balance any less genial, or, for that matter, any more reducible to the same wrongheaded theory, or any more right or wrong than Cyril's? Both sides had carefully qualified opinions regarding divine impassibility. Both sides admitted to the suffering of the human nature. Both sides had found a way to describe the link, or unity, between divine and human nature. One preferred a more divine perspective, emphasizing unity and kenosis; the other a more human perspective, emphasizing distinction (but not separation) between divine and human nature, and the fact that ultimately anything that human beings can say of God, or do to meet their purpose as creatures, is subject to their being part of God's creation. The apophatic principle can be applied to both sides. It may well be that 'it was God's kenosis that secured humanity's theosis' (171), but it is only in the process of the latter that the former can be stated. While Cyril stressed the former, the Antiochenes emphasized the latter. Whatever this has to say about the difficulty of modern theologians with divine impassibility remains to be asked. One might even conclude that it was Cyril's thought and its success and persuasiveness that made such a development possible at all. Are theologians like Moltmann, Juingel, Bauckham, Temple, Soelle, Lee, and many others perhaps too Cyrillian in their outlook? In that case, might not a good measure of Nestorian (or Arian) awe help them to understand a little bit better the importance of divine impassibility within any coherent and convincing Christian soteriology? To them, as well as to all who enjoy engaging with a well-written and tightly argued, albeit at times a bit lop sided, theological argument, G.'s book is warmly recommended, though its constant use of stereotype in its presentation of historical developments and,</page><page sequence="6">Book reviews 121 in connection with this, the lack of care in handling philological and historical material (including passages in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew), generally classical, biblical, and Patristic references, and even references to secondary literature, also deserves criticism.
