<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER TWO HISTORICAL CONTEXTS FOR THE EMERGENCE AND  TRANSMISSION OF BUDDHISM WITHIN SOUTH ASIA Interpreting the past is a critical concern for Buddhist communities,  despite stereotypes that associate mystical disregard of history with  Buddhism and other South Asian religious traditons. Flexible nar- ratives about the past have shaped Buddhist identities by providing  models of meritorious action and have contributed to expansion  beyond northeastern India by establishing locative links to the Bud- dha’s presence. Stories about the Buddha’s life and the formation of  the san֛gha connect his birth, awakening, teachings, miraculous perfor- mances, and recruitment of followers to specific places and temporal  frameworks. Hagiographical accounts of the rediscovery of the “True  Dharma” (saddharma) taught by previous Buddhas in earlier ages and  the turning of the “Wheel of Dharma” (dharmacakra) in the present  auspicious age (bhadrakalpa) may seem ahistorical, since the accom- plishments attributed to Śākyamuni Buddha are not particular to his  own historical circumstances.1 Although restrictive views of history as  an objective chronicle of past events would deny any value to traditional  identifications of links between causes in past lives and consequences  in present or future lifetimes in Buddhist literary sources, maximalist  conceptions of history as an effort to understand “how human actions  are significant and have a notable impact on our world” (Nattier 1991:  139) provide more scope for understanding why interpretation of past  actions was important for present concerns. The aim of this chapter is to clarify geographical and chronological  contexts for patterns and processes in the formation of Buddhism in  ancient and early medieval South Asia and its transregional expansion  1 For literary traditions about Buddhas of the past, auspicious present aeon (bhadra- kalpa), and the future, see Nattier, Jan. 1991.

Beginning  with the period of the historical Buddha’s lifetime in the fifth century  BCE, the chronological range of this overview extends to the late first  millennium CE. A detailed macrohistory of South Asian Buddhism is  beyond the intended scope, but significant junctures between politi- cal, economic, and social networks for Buddhist mobility are empha- sized in an effort to identify factors and catalysts for cross-cultural  transmission. An historical-critical approach to literary, epigraphical,  numismatic, and archaeological sources elucidates regional variation  and different actors, features, stages, and levels of Buddhist movement,  which fluctuated considerably with shifting political and commercial  alignments. This effort to investigate the role of trade exchanges, inter- cultural encounters, and inter- and intrareligious relationships in the  establishment, expansion, and decline of Buddhist institutions spurs  several questions, which are addressed throughout the chapter. What  was at stake for Buddhist communities in formulating stories about  the Buddha’s present and past lives, describing the formation of the  san֛gha, and locating events in regional settings? How did interactions  with other groups, including competing renouncer movements, Brah- mins, and exogenous migrants, shape Buddhist perspectives and prac- tices? What do available sources from within and outside of Buddhist  traditions reveal about the impact of social and economic changes on  Buddhist institutions? Which roles did Buddhist models of exchange,  patronage, and supramundane power play in commerce and socio- political legitimation? In the following subsections, which are structured diachronically  and regionally, I explore the formation and transmission of Buddhist  ideologies and institutions in changing historical and cultural environ- ments, since Buddhist traditions did not originate autonomously or  remain static.

Cross-Cultural Transmission between South Asia and Central Asia,  ca. 500–100 CE Initial Phases of the Establishment of Buddhist Communities in  Early India Hagiographic accounts of the Buddha’s religious biography combine  legendary narratives with information about the religious, social, eco- nomic, and political climate of his time, as viewed through later liter- ary lenses.2 Rather than separating historical fact from literary fiction  in order to demythologize the life story of the Buddha, the analysis of  Buddhist literary sources postdating the lifetime of the Buddha and  archaeological findings presented here is intended to establish basic  chronological and geographical parameters and to undertand the con- texts in which he and his followers flourished. Although the historical  Buddha’s precise dates are difficult to pinpoint, situating his lifetime  in the fifth century BCE has widespread implications for South Asian  history as well as religious and intellectual traditions during a period  of dynamic social and cultural change. Scholarly consensus on Śākyamuni Buddha’s date, which is in fact  the earliest historical date for building a relative chronology of late  Vedic religions and ancient Indian political dynasties, has recently  shifted in favor of a “short chronology” from a “long chronology” in  response to a 1988 symposium in Göttingen and the multivolume pub- lication of proceedings edited by Heinz Bechert.3 Although a “Nirvānsa  era” beginning with Śākyamuni’s parinirvānsa in 543 BCE is attested  2 Strong 2001 provides a useful overview of hagiographical traditions for the life  (and previous lives) of the Buddha according to various literary sources. Strong’s  stated goal is to portray the “Buddha of story” rather than the “Buddha of history”  since traditional legends “. . . are certainly more plentiful, more interesting, and more  revelatory of the ongoing concerns of Buddhists” (2001: 2). Historicist approaches  privileging Pāli and Sanskrit literary sources over vernacular biographies of the Bud- dha are criticized by Hallisey, Charles. 1995. “Roads Taken and Not Taken in the  Study of Theravāda Buddhism.” In Lopez 1995b: 31–61 (reprinted in Derris, Karen,  and Natalie Gummer, eds. 2007.

Lamotte (1988  [1958]: 13) discusses internal contradictions within the Pāli chronicles (Dīpavamssa  6.1.19–20, Mahāvamssa 5.21) and commentaries (Samantapāsādikā, Atthasālinī). 5 As detailed in the following subsection of this chapter, Aśoka’s 13th Major Rock  Edict provides a firm synchronism between the reign of Aśoka and five contemporary  Hellenistic rulers in ca. 255 BCE. 6 Evidence for a “short chronology” of the Buddha’s parinirvānsā 100 years before  Aśoka’s consecration in Dīpavamssa 1.24–26 and 5.55–59 supports Bechert’s hypothesis  that the long chronology” of 218 years was a later development (1989: 104 ff., 1991:  329–343). The earliest attested link between the Buddha’s parinirvānsa and Aśoka’s  reign a century later occurs in an avadāna set during the time of Aśoka “a century after  the Blessed Buddha achieved parinirvāna” (vasasśada parinsurvude budhe bhagavade) in  a first century CE Kharostshsī manuscript (British Library fragment 4.6 recto). 7 Prebish, Charles. 2008. “Cooking the Buddhist Books: The implications of the new  dating of the Buddha for the history of early Indian Buddhism.” Journal of Buddhist  Ethics 15 observes that “. . . most participants [in the Göttingen symposium] suggested  that the Buddha died within approximately a few decades on either side of 400 BCE”  (1).  8 Prebish examines implications of the “short chronology” for the dating of early  councils at Rājagrʕha, Vaiśālī, and Pātasliputra, concluding that the Vaiśālī council  occured 37 years before Aśoka’s coronation in 268 BCE, followed shortly by a “non- canonical” council at Pātasliputra marking the beginning of Buddhist sectarianism and  another “canonical” council in Pātasliputra (attested only in Pāli sources) 18 years later  (ca. 250 BCE). Prebish’s argument that “. . . we should use all the sources available to  us, and not just those that affirm a hypothesis that is convenient to our suppositions  and anticipated expectations” (2008: 14–15) implies that conflicting sources should  be accepted in order to construct a hybrid chronology for the date of the Buddha’s  parinirvānsa.  </page> <page sequence="5">  historical contexts 69 Buddha is also intertwined with traditional Jain dates for the nirvānsa  of Mahāvīra (alleged to be a Jain contemporary of Śākyamuni) in 528  or 510 BCE. 9 If we follow a short chronology for the historical Bud- dha’s parinirvānsa between ca. 400 and ca. 370 BCE, his lifespan of 80  years began in the early-mid fifth century BCE.   1011 Table 2.1: Proposed dates for the Historical Buddha Birth Parinirvānsa Long Chronology 623 543 BCE (Nirvānsa Era) Corrected Long Chronology 566 486 BCE10 Adjusted Short Chronology ca. 480 400 BCE Short Chronology ca. 450 370 BCE11 In addition to situating the historical Buddha’s lifetime in a relatively  specific time-frame between the middle of the fifth century and the  beginning of the fourth century BCE, it is also possible to locate hagio- graphical events memorialized in Buddhist literature, inscriptions,  monuments, and art in a geographical network of sacred sites. For  example, an inscription of Aśoka marks the location where Māyā gave  birth to Siddhārtha Gautama in a forest near the village of Lumbinī in  southern Nepal: The King, Beloved of the gods, of Loving Regard, when he had been  anointed twenty years, came in person and worshiped, because the Bud- dha Śākyamuni was born here. He had constructed walls inlaid with  stone (?) and had erected [this] stone pillar, because [i.e., to proclaim  that] the Lord was born here. The village of Lummini was made exempt  from taxation and [subject to paying only] one-eighth share [of its  produce].12  9 Śvetāmbara and Digambara dates for Mahāvīra’s nirvānsa conflict with Hema- candra’s report of a time-span of 155 years before the reign of Candragupta, who  began ruling after the Indian expedition of Alexander of Macedon between 327–5  BCE (Bechert 1989: 98–101). 10 218 years before Aśoka’s coronation in ca. 370–368 BCE. 11 100 years before Aśoka’s coronation. 12 Translated by Salomon 1998a: 264 (Appendix, selection 1: Rummindeī Minor  Pillar Edict of Aśoka; see Falk 2006: 177–180 for further references and a discussion  of silavagadsabhīcā or –ca, which he translates as “stone railing” instead of “walls inlaid  with stone”).  </page> <page sequence="6"> 70 chapter two The epigraphic evidence of Aśoka’s commemoration of a visit to the  Buddha’s birthplace at Lumbinī confirms the localization of pilgrimage  practices connected with this event by the middle of the third cen- tury BCE. The location of Kapilavastu, where Siddhārtha was raised  by his aunt Mahāprajāpatī as the son of Śuddhodana, a chief of the  Śākya clan, remains controversial.13 An early set of four sites plac- ing the awakening at Bodh Gaya, initial teaching at Sarnath, and  parinirvānsa at Kuśinagara were later expanded to a list of eight sites,  each with their own narrative cycles.14 Noting that the hagiography  of the Buddha grew in tandem with the proliferation of Buddhist pil- grimage places, John Strong remarks: “. . . ‘where’ something happened  is as significant as ‘what’ happened there” (2001: 5). Locative connec- tions reinforce claims to antiquity of oral discourses said to have been  spoken by the Buddha, doctrinal principles and monastic rules linked  with early recitations, and pilgrimage and ritual centers. While Jona- than Z. Smith identifies the promotion of a “locative, imperial world- view” with “scribal elites who had a deep vested interest in restricting  mobility and valuing place” (1978: 293),15 Buddhist efforts to local- ize hagiographic events in northeastern India and the Terai region of  modern Nepal did not inhibit or restrict mobility. Having situated the historical Buddha in northeastern India, what  can be said about the society in which he lived and taught? Portrayals  of Siddhārtha as a royal prince indicate that he was to be viewed as an  archetypal Ksastriya scion in the traditional socio-religious hierarchy.  However, fifth-fourth century BCE social contexts are difficult to recon- struct because Buddhist textual sources from periods later than the  time of the historical Buddha tend to reflect their own contemporary  social mores.16 Non-Buddhist traditions prescribing rigid stratification  13 The sites of Gotihawa and Pipri near Lumbinī have been excavated and the sur- rounding area has been surveyed by Verardi, Giovanni. 2007.

Upanisasds. Oxford: Oxford University Press, xxiv–xxix) are directly  relevant to Śākyamuni Buddha’s context. However, Dharmasūtras, which are more  concerned with maintaining separate varnsas, belong to periods later than the middle  of the third century BCE, according to Olivelle (1999.

(Chapter 9: The Dhammapada and the images  of the Bhikkhu). 21 It is interesting to note that the Brāhmansa Varga is the first chapter of the Khotan  Gāndhārī Dharmapada (Brough 1962: 119–125), but the final chapter of the Sanskrit  Udānavarga (Bernhard, Franz, ed. 1965. Udānavarga. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp;  Ruprecht., 1.460–509) and the Pāli Dhammapada (Norman, K. R., trans. 1997a. The  word of the doctrine (Dhammapada). Oxford: The Pali Text Society, 55–59). The first  Gāndhārī verse (Brough 1962: 119, 178, pl. I) corresponds partially to Pāli Dhamma- pada 393, 265, 267 and Sanskrit Udānavarga 33.8 (Bernhard 1965: 462).  </page> <page sequence="8"> 72 chapter two Although the Buddha is sometimes portrayed in modern accounts as a  social reformer or revolutionary through selective citation of passages  critical of Brahmins,22 social contexts reflected in Buddhist literature  are probably best understood against a background of dynamic social  change rather than reactions against stagnant social hierarchies. Buddhist hagiographic traditions clearly acknowledge that Ājīvikas  and Jain śramansa movements competed for religious and intellectual  eminence in northern India when Siddhārtha renounced his duties to  become a wandering mendicant. In accounts of the six years prior to  his awakening in Bodh Gaya, Siddhārtha encountered other śramansa  proponents of heterodox viewpoints and ascetic practices.23 Johannes  Bronkhorst provocatively argues that a “fundamental spiritual ideol- ogy” shared in common by Buddhism, Jainism, and Ājīvikism was “a  product of the spiritual culture of Greater Magadha” (2007: 28), which  had “. . . a culture of its own which was different from the culture of the  authors of Vedic and early post-Vedic literature” (2007: 9).24 Although  Bronkhorst’s attempt to localize shared assumptions about rebirth  and karmic retribution in Magadha is not ultimately convincing, his  point that early Buddhist doctrines were formulated in the context of  debates between different śramansa communities rather than in reac- tion to “Hindu” religious ideas and norms resonates with Louis de la  Vallée Poussin’s opinion that “the Brāhmanism from which Buddhism  sprang is not the Brāhmanism of the Brāhmansa and the Upanisasd,  but represents, even better than the latter, the ancient Indian yoga”  (quoted by Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 7). 22 Remarking that “To present him as a sort of socialist is a serious anachronism”  (2006: 30), Richard Gombrich rejects attempts to portray the Buddha as a social revo- lutionary (Gombrich, Richard F. 2006. Theravāda Buddhism: A social history from  ancient Benares to modern Colombo. 2nd rev. ed. London: Routledge [1st ed. 1988]). 23 Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan versions of the Śrāmansyaphala-sūtra (Mac- Queen, Graeme. 1988. A study of the Śrāmansyaphala-sūtra. Wiesbaden: O. Harras- sowitz) may now be compared with a partial Gāndhārī manuscript version in the  second scroll of the Senior collection (Allon, Mark. 2007. “Introduction: The Senior  Manuscripts.” In Glass 2007a: 8; Salomon 2003c: 79–80). 24 Bronkhorst, Johannes. 2007. Greater Magadha: Studies in the Culture of Early  India. Leiden/Boston: Brill. Also see Bronkhorst, Johannes. 2004. “Hinduism and Bud- dhism.” In Buswell 2004: 1.329. In my review of Bronkhorst 2007 (Journal of the Royal  Asiatic Society 18.3 [2008], 381–3), I do not accept Bronkhorst’s localization of a single  underlying “spiritual ideology” exclusively in Magadha (however broadly he intends  to define the cultural region as wherever the historical Buddha lived) because the  origins of basic ideas about rebirth, karmic retribution, the self, and ascetic practices  probably belonged to a more extensive geographical and cultural milieu.  </page> <page sequence="9">  historical contexts 73 What is at issue is the extent to which basic theories of a self  (ātman) that transmigrates through the cycle of continuous rebirth  (the samssāra paradigm) originated internally from the Vedic back- ground or were introduced through processes of inter-religious con- tact, structural developments of rebirth eschatologies, or other external  possibilities.25 While certain Vedic ideas and practices (such as ani- mal sacrifice and Brahminical authority) are clearly rejected by Jains  and Buddhists, the composers of the early Upanisasds (particularly the  Brʕhadāransyaka Upanisasd and Chāndogya Upanisasd) were also ques- tioning, challenging, and reformulating Vedic rituals, cosmologies, and  established mores. Since śramansa traditions and the early Upanisasds  belong to a similar climate of intellectual ferment in northern India  during a period of significant social and religious change, scholars  have attempted to establish relative chronological relationships and  to identify directional influences. In contrast to the consensus view  that Buddhism and Jainism “emerged not long after the composition  of the early Upanisasds” (Olivelle 1996: xxiii), Bronkhorst argues that  “at least some portions of the early Upanisasds—perhaps precisely the  portions that introduce the belief in rebirth and karmic retribution  into the Veda—were composed more or less at the time of the Bud- dha, or later” (2007: 258). Although K.R. Norman finds “. . . echoes of  Upanisasdic statements in the Buddha’s sermons” (1997b: 33), especially  in the opposition between the Buddhist doctrine of “no self ” (Sanskrit  anātman / Pāli anattā) and the equivalence between the individual self  (ātman) and universal self (brahman) in the Chāndogya Upanisasd, it is  not clear that Buddhists were responding to specific passages in early  Upanisasds.26 Instead of postulating that Buddhist ideas developed in  reaction to prior speculations in the early Upanisasds, it seems quite  likely that they emerged from a shared nexus of intense intellectual  25 Obeyesekere, Gananath. 2002. Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in  Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth. Berkeley: University of California Press  describes this theory as a “karmic eschatology” and proposes structural parallels with  theories of rebirth in other cultures. 26 Although he acknowledges possible similarities in thought and language, Bronk- horst rejects Norman’s arguments for a specific link between the Buddhist doctrine of  anattā as expressed in in the Alagaddūpama Sutta (Majjhima Nikāya I 136) and the  equation of ātman and brahman attributed to Śānsdsilya in the Chāndogya Upanisasd  by pointing out that the Pāli sutta does not mention the concept of brahman and the  notion of a permanent “immutable” self is “largely absent from the early Upanisasds”  (2007: 217). Bronkorst dismisses other “superficial similarities” (2007: 218) proposed  by Richard Gombrich as evidence for early Buddhist familiarity with Upanisasds.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 74 chapter two and philosophical debate and competition with other śramansas and  Brahmins in the middle of the first millennium BCE. Economic conditions of rural prosperity, urban growth, politi- cal consolidation, and expanding trade networks contributed to the  institutional organization of the Buddhist san֛gha, which emerged in  an environment of material prosperity rather than hardship. While  agricultural surplus was not the only causal factor of a “second urban- ization” in the Ganga-Yamuna doāb following a long hiatus of about  a millennium from the “mature phase” of the Indus Valley civiliza- tion (ca. 2300–1800 BCE), urban centers remained “predator[s] on  the countryside” (Erdösy 1987: 17).27 Although the presence of North- ern Black Polished (NBP) ware beginning ca. 550 BCE in the eastern  Ganges plain is a sign of “incipient urbanism” (Thapar 2003: 140),28  archaeological evidence does not display traits of “thriving urbanisa- tion” (Erdösy 1987: 14) until the third century BCE. Buddhist literary  references to large cities at the time of the Buddha have led many inter- preters, including Max Weber, to posit causal relationships between  the growth of cities and the emergence of Buddhism.29 However, Greg- ory Bailey and Ian Mabbett criticize the “urbanization hypothesis” as a  “post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy” of “treating effects as causes” (2003:  34). They acknowledge that the Pāli canonical texts on which they  depend to support their argument that Buddhism arose after a period  of rapid urbanization belong to later periods (2003: 4), but neverthe- less base their analysis of economic and social contexts from the fifth  century BCE down to the time of Aśoka almost exclusively on this  problematic textual tradition, which “does not coincide with the earli- est phase of urbanization, but with the more mature period” (Thapar  27 Erdösy, George. 1987. “Early Historic Cities of Northern India.” South Asian  Studies 3, 1–23. 28 Thapar, Romila. 2003.

Thus, many features reflected in archaeological and tex- tual sources from this general period in the late first millennium CE,  including the expansion of local, regional, and long-distance trade net- works, must instead be seen as concurrent with rather than prior or  posterior to the formation of early Buddhism.      30 Later Buddhist, Jain and purānsic sources refer back to sixteen “great  countries” (mahājanapadas) of ancient India which competed for  political and economic preeminence in the mid-late first millennium  BCE.31 Rather than designating states with fixed boundaries, the term  30 Adopted from Allchin 1995: 116, fig. 7.4. 31 Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra. 1923.

Thus, the major janapadas are closely linked with the emergence of  urban administrative capitals. The geographical distribution of these  territories extended from the Northwest (Gandhāra and Kamboja)  to central and southern India (Avanti, Cedi, and Asmaka), with the  heaviest concentration in the Ganges basin (including Magadha and  Anga at the eastern extreme). This range was much broader than the  Brahmanical limits of the “Land of the Āryas” (Āryāvarta), which is  defined in the Dharmasūtras and the Mahābhāsysa of Patañjali (prob- ably second century BCE) as “The region to the east of where the  Sarasvatī disappears, west of Kālaka forest, south of the Himalayas,  and north of the Pāriyātra mountains” (Olivelle 2005: 36).32 The exclu- sion of Magadhans and other easterners from the Brahminical heart- land of Āryāvarta may suggest that they were “still not completely  brahmanized” (Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 7). Romila Thapar observes that  the widening of geographical horizons in Jain and Buddhist traditions  parallels an eastward shift in the religious “epicentre” (2003: 138) from  Vedic centers in the west to the northeastern regions where śramansa  movements originated and flourished. 7–8 lists the 16 great countries with their capitals based on Mahābhārata 8.40.29–8- .45.14–16, 28, 34, 40, Mahāvastu 1.34, and Dīgha Nikāya III, p. 200.

In Mānavadharmaśāstra  2.21–22 (maybe second century CE), virtually identical boundaries (“The land between  the Himalaya and Vindhya ranges, to the east of Vinaśana and west of Prayāga”)  correspond to the “Middle Region” (madhyadeśa), while Āryāvarta more broadly  includes areas “from the eastern to the western sea” (Olivelle, Patrick, trans. 2004.

During Śākyamuni’s lifetime, the kingdom of  Magadha vied with Kosala for control of northern India.33 Since the  Buddha stayed in Śrāvastī, the capital of Kosala, during many rainy  seasons (varsasvāsa), King Prasenajit is depicted as a prominent patron,  along with his chief queen Mallikā and other local donors, especially  the wealthy merchant Anāthapinsdsada.34 For example, a story about the  Buddha’s acceptance of an invitation from Anāthapinsdsada’s female  servant Puniga (Sanskrit: Pūrnsikā; Pāli: Punsnsikā or Punsnsā) is briefly  summarized in an avadāna in a first century Kharostshsī manuscript: Puniga was the (*maid) of the householder Anasa˟pidsiga (Anāthapinsdsada).  The Bhagavat was addressed by King Prase˟niga (Prasenajit). The Buddha  did not agree [to his request] . . . and he did not agree [to the request] of  all the householders.35 This narrative exemplifies the role of female patrons, including indi- viduals like the maidservant Punniga, whose offer to the Buddha to  stay in Śrāvastī is deemed more sincere than invitations from Prasena- jit, Anāthapinsdsada and other wealthy male householders. However,  the localization of Buddhist literary narratives in Kosala is a common  archetype, since Śrāvastī during the reign of Prasenajit is the formulaic  setting for numerous discourses attributed to the Buddha.36 Under King Bimbisāra, a brother-in-law of Prasenajit who was  also lauded as a patron of the early Buddhist community, Magadha  became the most powerful kingdom in northern India, with the capital  at Rājagrsha regarded as a wealthy center and major site for the early  33 Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 10–12, Raychaudhuri 1923: 199–209, and Tripathi 1942:  89 describe relationships between the four major kingdoms of Vatsa ruled by Udena,  Avanti ruled by Pradyota, Kosala ruled by Prasenajit, and Magadha ruled by Bimbisāra,  while Thapar lists the “four rival states” (2003: 151) as Kāśī, Kośala, Magadha, and the  the Vrijji oligarchy.  34 Malalasekera 1937: s.v.

Despite his connection with a failed attempt by Deva- datta to assassinate the Buddha, Ajātaśatru later hosted the Buddha  and his entourage in Rājagrsha before his final journey to Kuśinagara.  Ajātaśatru and his ministers play major roles in the events preceding  and following the Buddha’s Mahāparinirvānsa. Ajātaśatru continued to  rule for another 24 years, followed by five successive parricides, rule  by the minister Siśunāga, and the rise and fall of the Nanda dynasty.38  Although the historical memory of these figures preserved in religious  and literary sources can not be corroborated by coins, inscriptions, or  reliable historiographical traditions from outside of South Asia, the  emergence of the Mauryan empire based in Magadha coheres well  with archaeological evidence for the growth of powerful cities in the  prior period. Legacy of the Mauryans: Aśoka as Dharmarāja Mauryan control of important nodes along overland routes in the  Indian subcontinent significantly influenced early patterns for the  growth and expansion of the Buddhist san֛gha. While the san֛gha’s  37 Chronological details connected with Bimbisāra’s genealogy and reign remain  unclear. Raychaudhuri acknowledges that “There is considerable disagreement between  the Purānsas and the Ceylonese Chronicles regarding the chronology of the kings of  the Bimbisārian (or Nāga) and Saiśunāga dynasties” (1923: 116). Magadhan dynas- tic genealogies in Buddhist and Jain sources are compiled by Lamotte 1988 [1958]:  87–104 and Tripathi 1942: 113–114, who gives a separate table following purānsic  chronologies, which limit his reign to 28 rather than 52 years (Tripathi 1942: 94, fn.  1). According to Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 4, Magadha was organized as a kingdom only  during the Buddha’s time.Tripathi 1942: 104–108 comments on economic conditions  and Thapar 2003: 152–155 discusses administration. The total of 200 years for the total  length of the reign of Bimbisāra, Ajātaśatru, and their successors until the time of the  first Nanda ruler in chronologies reported by Pāli vamssas is very suspicious, while  purānsic alternatives transpose numerous figures.  38 If a short chronology for the Buddha’s parinirvānsa around 370 BCE is adopted,  only about 30 years is allowed between the end of Ajātaśatru’s reign and Candragupta  Maurya’s accession. Pāli chronologies limit the “9 Nandas” to 22 years, but the reigns  of Śiśunāga (Susunāga), and Kālāśoka and his ten sons would have to be telescoped  from 68 years to less than 10 years. Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 89 doubts the existence of  Kālāśoka, thus shortening the chronology.  </page> <page sequence="15">  historical contexts 79 horizons were initially limited to the Ganges River basin in northern  India during the time of the Buddha, the initial extension of Buddhist  establishments throughout South Asia was greatly accelerated by high  level support from the Mauryan emperor Aśoka, who is portrayed as  an ideal patron in Buddhist literature. In comparison to what can only  be vaguely known about conditions in the period of the historical Bud- dha, a wider variety of contemporary sources provide more reliable  evidence of religious and political life during the Mauryan period from  about the last quarter of the fourth century BCE to the beginning of  the second century BCE. As the earliest written evidence for the study  of ancient South Asia, Aśokan inscriptions directly indicate condi- tions in which Buddhist institutions began to flourish by the middle  of the third century BCE.39 The fragmentary reports of Megasthenes,  a Seleukid ambassador to the Mauryan court at Pātasliputra under  Aśoka’s grandfather Candragupta, preserve an outsider’s cross-cul- tural perspective on India seen through Greek lenses.40 Candragupta  and Aśoka are primarily remembered in Jain and Buddhist literature,  but the literary images of these Mauryan rulers as exclusive patrons  39 In addition to Hultszch 1925 and Falk 2006 cited in the first chapter (p. 52, fn.  147), also see translations by Bloch, Jules. 1950.

Candragupta Maurya, the founder of the dynasty, seized control of  Magadha after rising to power from obscure origins. Candragupta can  be identified with Sandrokottos, an Indian ruler who may have encoun- tered Alexander of Macedon during his expedition to Gandhāra, Pun- jab, and the lower Indus valley between 327–325 BCE.43 Based on a  reported meeting between Candragupta and Alexander, historians pro- pose that Candragupta probably began to rule between 324–313 BCE.44  41 Buddhist literary sources on Aśoka are examined by Strong, John. 1983.

As discussed in the previous section, dates for the historical Buddha  hinge upon Aśoka’s consecration in the middle of the third century  BCE. Aśokan inscriptions are not dated in a continuous era that can be  correlated with the Common Era, but references to five contemporary  Hellenistic rulers in the 13th Major Rock Edict issued after the 13th  year of his reign serve as “the bedrock of the chronology of Indian  history, interlocking the date of the Mauryas with Hellenistic kings”  (Thapar 2003: 182).52 The synchronism between the dates for these  rulers and the internal chronology of Aśoka’s regnal years establishes  almost certain dates for the beginning of his rule between 274–268  BCE, making a consecration around 270 BCE (or slightly later) fairly  49 Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 249 refers to Dīpavamssa VI, 21–2, Mahāvamssa V, 20–21,  39–40, 189, Samantapāsādikā p. 41, and Mahābodhivamssa pp. 98–99.

Patterns of distribution of Aśokan inscriptions indicate the geograph- ical extent of the Mauryan empire at its peak (Map 2.2: Distribution  of Aśoka’s Inscriptions). Major Rock Edicts located in the Mauryan  borderlands demonstrate that Aśoka’s domain eventually extended to  ancient Kaling֛a (modern Orissa) in eastern India, the western coast of  India (Girnar in Gujarat and Sopara in Maharashtra), southern India (as  far as Suvarnsagiri in Karnataka), and the northwestern frontiers in mod- ern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. While most of Aśoka’s inscrip- tions are written in Middle-Indo-Aryan Prakrit vernacular languages  using the Brāhmī script (which was probably developed for this purpose  during the Mauryan period), Major Rock Edicts written in Kharostshsī  at Mansehra and Shahbaz garhi (in northwestern Pakistan) reflect lin- guistic and cultural differences within the Mauryan realm.54 Greek and  Aramaic versions of Aśokan inscriptions from Kandahar (southeastern  Afghanistan) show that Mauryan officials also used non-Indic adminis- trative languages and scripts for transmitting imperial messages.55 In addition to supplying concrete evidence for the dates of his reign  and the territorial boundaries of his empire, inscriptions issued by  Aśoka refer to administrative policies, patronage of various religious  communities, and the application of his principles of Dharma. Aśoka  addressed his orders to various officials who were responsible for writ- ing and transmitting his instructions. For example, the Rājukas (rural  53 Bongard-Levin 1998: 68 proposes an absolute date of 268 BCE for Aśoka’s con- secration based on an astronomical calculations of a solar eclipse in 249 BCE, which  he proposes to link with Aśoka’s pilgrimage to Lumbini in his twentieth regnal year  based on literary references to a solar eclipse during his tour of Buddhist sites. Some  additional time may be allowed for communications about contemporary rulers to  filter through the ancient world to Aśoka’s court (Karttunen 1997a: 266). 54 Salomon 1998a: 73–75. 55 Pugliese Carratelli, Giovanni and Giovanni Garbini. 1964.

He encouraged his  subjects to perform Dharma ceremonies which promote “regard for  slaves and servants, respect for teachers, restrained behavior towards  living beings, and donations to śramansas and Brahmins”57 and defined  the “gift of Dharma” (Dhamsmadāna / Dhramadane) as “good behav- ior towards slaves and servants, obedience to mother and father,  generosity towards friends, acquaintances, and relatives and towards  śramansas and Brahmans.”58 Other passages called for generous dona- tions to both Brahmans and śramansas and expressed a tolerant atti- tude towards “all sects” (Bloch 1950: 121) or “religious communities”  (Sircar 1967b: 55): King Priyadarśin, Beloved of the Gods, honors all religious groups  (pāsamsda, prasamsdsa), both ascetics and householders, with various  gifts and honors. But the Beloved of the Gods does not consider gifts or  honors to be as valuable as increasing what is essential for all religious  groups. This increase in what is essential is manifold, but its basis is  restraint of speech, so as not to extol one’s own religious group or deni- grate others’ at improper occasions, or only do so mildly on appropriate  occasions.59 Although Aśoka promoted “restraint of speech” (vacigutti), the  admonition against sectarian polemics reflects intensive competition  between groups of Brahmans and śramansas for imperial patronage.  Inscriptions lauding generosity to Brahmans and recording donations  of caves to the Ājīvikas at Barabar indicate that Aśoka’s patronage  56 Translation of in the 4th Pillar Edict issued in his 26th regnal year follows Thapar  1961: 263, who also discusses this pillar edict in more detail (1961: 103–108).

Before addressing this issue directly, it  is necessary to recognize that Aśoka interpreted Dharma broadly as  religious piety, personal morality, and social ethics applicable to his  entire realm rather than adopting a specifically Buddhist sense of the  term. The governing principles of Dharma are succinctly defined in  the 2nd Pillar Edict: Dharma is good. And what is Dharma? (It is) few faults, abundant vir- tues, compassion, generosity, truthfulness, and purity.61 Aśoka’s view of Dharma encompasses ideals of nonviolence, tolerance,  moderation, and respect for parents, teachers, and elders, which are  drawn from a wide variety of orthodox Brahmanical perspectives and  heterodox Buddhist, Jain, and probably Ājīvika values. Since Buddhist  doctrines of the Four Truths, Eightfold Path, “no self ” (anātman), or  release from rebirth through the attainment of nirvānsa are not men- tioned in non-Buddhist inscriptions, scholars have debated the extent  to which Aśoka intended to implement Buddhist principles or appro- priated certain elements to formulate official propaganda to unify dis- parate religious groups within the Mauryan empire with an acceptable  ideology. Although Richard Gombrich and Romila Thapar, for exam- ple, hold that Buddhist ideas inspired Aśoka’s formulation of Dharma,  K.R. Norman regards his Dharma policy as “exclusively a moral one”  with “no hint of anything exclusively Buddhist” (1997b: 117).62 In sets  60 Falk 2006: 258–269 re-examines the architecture and inscriptions of the Barabar  caves, and presents a new reading and translation of three donations by Aśoka in his  12th and 19th regnal years. The excavation of caves in the Nāgārjuni hills (nearby  Barabar) donated to the Ājīvikas by Daśaratha, one of Aśoka’s descendants, may have  begun while Aśoka was ruling (Falk 2006: 257, 276). 61 Bloch 1950: 162; Hultzsch 1925: 120–121; Sircar 1967b: 71; Thapar 1961: 262.  It is interesting to note that dharma is translated as eusebeia (“piety”) in a bilingual  Greek-Aramic inscription and in partial Greek translations of the 12th-13th major  rock edicts in Kandahar (Falk 2006: 242–245; Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 714–715; Pugliese  Carratelli and Garbini 1964: 33). Bongard-Levin observes that the Greek term “con- veys the idea of righteousness, not religious belief ” and explains that Aśoka’s moral  precepts were “traditional ethical principles easily comprehended by various strata of  the population regardless of their ethnic origin or religious allegiance” (1998: 79). 62 Gombrich attempts to identify “distinctively Buddhist values” (2006: 131) in  Aśokan inscriptions by pointing out similarities with prescriptions for Buddhist lay  </page> <page sequence="23">  historical contexts 87 of major rock edicts and pillar edicts inscribed throughout the Mau- ryan domain, Aśoka appears to have maintained a distinction between  the official Dharma and his own commitment as a Buddhist devotee,  which he clearly expressed in other inscriptions discussed below. The violent conquest of Kalin֛ga was a pivotal turning point that  caused Aśoka to express deep remorse and to adopt “Victory of  Dharma” (dharmavijaya) as the goal of his rule.63 In the 13th Major  Rock Edict, Aśoka declared that the impetus for him to practice, desire,  and teach Dharma was the mass deportation of 150,000 people, killing  of 100,000, and the subsequent loss of life of many more resulting from  the subjugation of Kalin֛ga during the eighth year of his reign.64 In this  singular epigraphic record, Aśoka juxtaposes military conquests to the  “Victory of Dharma” by proclaiming: This Dharma inscription has been written so that my sons and grand- sons would not pursue new conquests. They should delight their own  minds, regarding real victory (won by) patience and leniency. They must  realize Victory of Dharma is the real conquest.65 The bloodshed in Kalin֛ga may have prompted Aśoka to embrace Jain  and Buddhist principles of nonviolence (ahimssā), but the application  of this ideal was tempered by the need to suppress rebellions and pun- ish criminals. In the same inscription, a threat to punish forest tribes  makes it very clear that Aśoka was not willing to relinquish the use  of violence if his power was threatened.66 Thus, Aśoka’s admonitions  morality in Pāli texts such as the Sīgālovāda sutta and the Kūtasdanta sutta. According  to Thapar, “. . . much of the ideology of Dhamma which he enunciated was inspired  by Buddhism. But to equate it totally with Buddhism and to suggest that Aśoka was  propagating Buddhism as a state religion is to read more into the edicts than was  intended by the monarch” (1975: 42). Thapar believes that Aśoka’s Dhamma served  as a “group of unifying principles” (2003: 201) rather than a narrow sense of religious  piety. Lamotte asserted that “Aśoka himself makes a clear distinction between his  personal Dharma . . . and the Buddhist Law” (1988 [1958]: 228). 63 Norman 1997b: 114–115 attributes Aśoka’s Buddhist conversion to remorse for  carnage in a war with Kalin֛ga, but the chronology of the undated Minor Rock Edicts  (which Norman believes were issued in his 11th regnal year) does not necessarily  indicate that he became a Buddhist upāsaka after the Kalin֛ga war. 64 Norman’s view that “. . . Aśoka expanded his empire by force, but thereafter  devised the principle of victory by morality [Dharma] and commended it to his  successors” (1997b: 118) seems apparent from the evidence of the 13th Major Rock  Edict. 65 Bloch 1950: 132; Sircar 1967b: 59; Thapar 1961: 256–257. 66 Fussman’s comments on this passage in the 13th Major Rock Edict help to clarify  the apparent contrast between the ideal of nonviolence and its application: “. . . the  </page> <page sequence="24"> 88 chapter two against violence coupled with threats against resistance argue strongly  against over-idealizing his image as a ruler who governed according  to nonviolent principles, since it was still necessary for him to enforce  Mauryan power. Aśoka’s inscriptions recording visits to Buddhist sites and addressed  directly to the Buddhist san֛gha deserve particular attention for illumi- nating early pilgrimage practices, tensions within monastic cummuni- ties, and the circulation of orally transmitted texts. Aśoka explicitly  identifies himself as a Buddhist lay follower in fourteen versions of his  Minor Rock Edicts composed in his tenth regnal year and distributed  widely throughout the Mauryan empire: Thus speaks the Beloved of the Gods. More than two and a half years  have passed since I became a Buddhist layman (upāsake), but I was not  zealous. Now more than a year has passed since I approached the san֛gha  and have become more zealous.67 His visits to the site of the Buddha’s awakening (samsbodhi),  Siddhārtha’s birthplace at Lumbinī and the stūpa of the previous Bud- dha Konākamana at Nigāli Sāgar indicate a strong proclivity to Bud- dhist devotional practices.68 These epigraphic records show that his  literary reputation as “the stūpa builder par excellence” (Strong 1983:  109) had some basis, although no Aśokan inscriptions discovered to  king’s orders should be applied everywhere, even among the populations who live on  the fringe of the Empire, under the threat of violent repression” (1987b: 51). More  bluntly, “If persuasion did not succeed, there was always force” (ibid., 53). 67 Andersen, Paul Kent. 1990. Studies in the Minor Rock Edicts of Aśoka.

Konākamana, who precedes the previ- ous Buddha Kāśyapa in the present Bhadrakalpa, is known elsewhere as Konāgamena  (Bhārhut inscription B 16, Lüders 1963: 85–86), Konagamuni (Library of Congress  *Bahubuddha-sūtra Kharostshsī scroll, Salomon, forthcoming), Konsāgamana (Pāli,  Malalasekera 1937: 1.681–2), and Konsākamuni/Kanakamuni (Edgerton 1953 [BHSD]:  167).

Three versions of the so-called “Schism edict” written on pillars at  Sarnath, Sāñcī, and Kauśāmbī seem to indicate that Aśoka ordered  his administrators to intervene directly in the affairs of the Buddhist  san֛gha. Common to all three versions is an admonition against caus- ing a split in the community: “Whoever creates a schism in the san֛gha,  whether monk or nun, is to be dressed in white garments, and to be  put in an uninhabited place.”69 Although their interpretation remains  disputed, the inscriptions refer to problems of division in the com- munity (san֛ghabheda), which Aśoka may have been called upon to  police.70 K.R. Norman (1997b: 122–129) compares the anti-schism  edicts to different Pāli versions of a third communal recitation believed  by the Theravāda tradition to have been held at Pātasliputra during the  time of Aśoka. Norman concludes that the Aśokan inscriptions and  Pāli accounts of a third council do not necessarily refer to the same  event, but suggests that Aśoka may have indirectly intervened to evict  infiltrators who were not Buddhist monks or nuns from a royally sup- ported monastery or monasteries. A separate Aśokan edict found at Bairat in Rajasthan but brought to  the Asiatic Society in Calcutta after its discovery recommends particular  texts to Buddhist monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.71 While some  identifications remain uncertain, the seven “discourses on dharma”  (Prakrit: dhamsma-paliyāyāni / Sanskrit: dharma-paryāyāhs) referred  to in this inscription provide a valuable glimpse of the types of texts  that were being circulated through oral transmission in the middle  of the third century BCE.72 As K.R. Norman observes, “. . . we can say  69 Bloch 1950: 152–153; Hultzsch 1925: 159–164; Mookerji 1928: 193–200, 243–244;  Sircar 1967b: 66–67; Thapar 1961: 262. Lamotte interprets this passage to mean that  “The king’s intention was to reduce dissidents to lay status, by forcing them to return  to the white robe of householders” (1988 [1958]: 238). 70 Sasaki, Shizuka. 1989–1999. “Buddhist Sects in the Aśoka Period” (1–8).

The short individual verse texts selected  by Aśoka belong to a very early stratum of Buddhist literature, prob- ably before they were classified into fixed textual categories of nikāyas,  āgamas, and pitaskas. The significance of Aśoka’s recommendation of  these texts extends beyond issues of textual classifications and relative  chronology, since he explained that his motive for addressing the lay  and monastic community was to ensure the durability of the “True  Dharma” (Prakrit: sadhamsma / Sanskrit: saddharma). His concern  about the vulnerability of the Buddha’s teachings to decline or dis- appearance was probably not merely formulaic, but grounded in the  turbulent political and religious realities of his age. Buddhist traditions claim that Aśoka played an active role in the  transmission of Buddhism by sending missionaries beyond Mauryan  India, but his inscriptions do not provide corroboration. In the 13th  Major Rock Edict, Aśoka lists realms of contemporary Hellenistic rul- ers, neighboring kingdoms, and imperial territories where his pre- scriptions for Dharma are followed, and grandiloquently claims that  his instructions are followed even in places not visited by his envoys.73  Even if such exaggerated proclamations were believable at some level  (if Aśoka’s envoys did reach distant lands), the Dharma that was trans- mitted would not have been the Dharma taught by Buddhist monks  and nuns, but the more general imperial ideology brought by royal  Mauryan messengers. Similar reservations apply to another passage in  the 5th Major Rock Edict in which Aśoka refers to the appointment  of “Dharma Ministers” (dharma-mahāmātras): They are busy in all sects, establishing Dhamma, increasing the interest  in Dhamma, and attending to the welfare and happiness of those who  are devoted to Dhamma among the Greeks (Yonas), the Kambojas, the  Gandhārans, the Ristshsikas, the Pitinikas, and the other peoples of the  west.74 References to the borderland inhabitants of the northwestern frontiers  of the Mauryan empire suggest that the Dharma-mahāmātras were  and Upatisa-pasine with Suttanipāta vv. 955–975) are uncertainly agreed upon  (Schopen 1997a [1985a]: 24–5). 73 Thapar 1961: 256. 74 Translation according to Thapar 1961: 252 (see pp. 156–158 for additional com- mentary on mahāmātras, although viewing these officials as social welfare agents is  probably anachronistic).  </page> <page sequence="27">  historical contexts 91 Mauryan imperial agents rather than Buddhist missionaries. While  it is possible that Buddhist monks and nuns may have accompanied  diplomatic missions, the strongest support for such an interaction is  not from inscriptions, but from much later accounts in Pāli chronicles  attributing the conversion of Sri Lanka to Aśoka’s son Mahinda and  daughter San֛ghamittā.75 Although Aśokan Buddhist inscriptions and  the remains of Mauryan period stūpas and monasteries generally sup- port his portrayal as an ardent patron of the san֛gha, the expansion of  Buddhism during this period should be attributed to relatively stable  political and economic conditions rather than state patronage.76 A virtual silence in Brahmanical Sanskrit sources with regard to  Aśoka’s legacy contrasts sharply with his legendary status in Buddhist  literature. Despite Aśoka’s undoubtable historical achievements, charac- ters with the name of Aśoka are rarely mentioned in the Mahābhārata,  perhaps in oblique association with demonic asuras.77 Although “Bud- dhism was in the air for the poets of the Mahābhārata” (Hiltbeitel  2005: 129), there is not a single explicit reference to the Buddha or  to the Buddhist tradition. Such omissions of important historical fig- ures and religious ideologies suggest that Aśoka’s role was deliberately  downplayed because of his support for the Buddhist san֛gha in the  post-Mauryan period, when the core of the Mahābhārata may have  been composed.78 75 Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 297 does not regard Pāli accounts of the initial transmis- sion of Buddhism to Sri Lanka as reliable, but Gombrich 2006: 135–136 believes the  accounts of Aśokan missions are more credible. According to Kevin Trainor, there is  “solid historical evidence that the basic facts of the mission to Sri Lanka are trustwor- thy” (1997: 86), but the primary evidence is a Brāhmī inscription marking a stūpa of  the Idsika (Ittshsiya) and Mahinda, a common name that is not clearly preserved.  76 Following Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 215 and Norman 1997b: 129 rather than Gom- brich 2006: 136.

James Fitzgerald agrees that a  “Double Crisis of Dharma” was precipitated by Aśoka and other rulers  who “elevated the world-denying, brahmin criticizing movements to  positions of imperial honor equal to or superior to that of the Vedas”  (2004: 115). However, Fitzgerald views Yudhistshsira not as a represen- tation of Aśoka but as a rebuttal or refutation of his “blithe embrace”  (137) of nonviolence, since Yudhistshsira and his Pānsdsava brothers and  allies justify violent actions to restore Dharma. Thus, the compos- ers of the Mahābhārata in the centuries following Aśoka consciously  juxtaposed Yudhistshsira, the ideal Ksastriya ruler who “stands steady  in battle,” to the Buddhist emperor (cakravartin) and Dharmarāja  Aśoka. Alf Hiltbeitel accepts the possibility of polysemic juxtapositions  between Yudhistshsira and Aśoka, suggests parallels between the Brah- later additions, which continued at least until the Gupta period. Fitzgerald 2004: xvi,  n. 2 argues that the “written Sanskrit text” provoked by Aśoka’s “dharma-campaign”  was substantially completed during or shortly after the time of the Śun ֛gas and Kānsvas  (between the middle of the 2nd century BCE and the end of the 1st century BCE,  although 1st century CE is also possible), with systematic expansions continuing until  ca. 400 CE. Hiltbeitel 2005: 113 opts for a more constricted period of composition  from about 150 BCE to 0 CE. While earlier scholars proposed more cautious estimates  between ca. 400 BCE–400 CE, specialists are attempting to define phases of composi- tion in the last two centuries BCE followed by significant interpolations in the 1st–3rd  centuries CE, with a final form as late as ca. 500 CE.  79 Hiltbeitel comments that questions about relationships between the Mahābhārata  and Buddhism were raised by Adolf Holtzmann, whose ‘inversion theory’ linked  Aśoka with a foreign Buddhist Duryodhana, and, as he puts it, “certain authors are  still playing with the same gamepieces” (2005: 108). Biardeau 2002 proposed that the  “initial shock” (l’ébranlement initial, 1.103) of Aśoka’s embrace of Buddhism led to a  Brahmanical reaction (1.113), resulting in an epic “riposte to the Buddhist menace”  (1.136). Biardeau elaborated on this hypothesis in her conclusion: “Épopée et Boud- dhisme” (2.747–782).  80 Sutton, Nick. 1997. “Aśoka and Yudhistshsira: A Historical Setting for the Ideo- logical Tensions of the Mahābhārata?” Religion 27, 333–341. </page> <page sequence="29">  historical contexts 93 min general Dronsa and the historical figure of Pusysamitra Śun֛ga, and  notices similarities between the denigration of stūpa (edsūka) worship  in Mārkansdseya’s ex eventu prophecies of barbarization and criticisms  of religious festivals in Aśokan inscripions.81 However, he cautions  that “one-to-one readings [such as Yudhistshsira as a representation  or refutation of Aśoka] may have something persuasive about them  without being as singly correct as their proposers propound” (2005:  129). While juxtapositions between Aśoka’s interpretation of Dharma  and Yudhistshsira’s reconfiguration of Ksastriya identity have stimulated  scholarly interpretations, reading the Mahābhārata as a response to  issues of religious patronage and rivalry during the Mauryan period  may circumscribe this complex text too neatly and narrowly. The  Mahābhārata may just as likely belong to chronological and histori- cal contexts from the second century BCE through third century CE  when Indo-Greek, Saka, and Kusāsnsa rulers established dominion over  northern India and Buddhist institutions expanded beyond central  nodes and main routes formerly controlled by the Mauryans. The historical memory of Aśoka as a model royal Buddhist patron  persisted far beyond South Asia, but his impact on ancient Indian  political history and non-Buddhist religious traditions is difficult to  assess. The dynastic succession after Aśoka is vague, and the Mauryan  empire disintegrated within fifty years of his death in ca. 230 BCE.82  Daśaratha, who may have directly followed Aśoka, donated caves to  the Ājīvikas at Nāgārjunī Hill near Barabar and is known in some  purānsic genealogies, but is not mentioned in Buddhist or Jain sources.83  In the Divyāvadāna, Asoka’s successor Kunsāla was sent to subdue a  revolt in Taxila, where he was blinded as a result of an order issued  by Tisysaraksistā, the chief queen.84 According to this account, Kunsāla’s  son Samprati (who is known in Jain literature as a great patron) then  became emperor after Aśoka exhausted the empire’s resources by  81 Hiltbeitel 2005: 113, 126. According to Hiltbeitel, “further reminders of an inter- face with a Buddhism compounded by mlecchification” (2005: 127) reflect a basic  antipathy between Brahmins and heterodox Buddhists. His decoding (following  Biardeau 2002: 2.753–758) of Jarāsamsdha as a representation of Māra (or Aśoka) in  juxaposition to Krssnssa as a figure of Bhakti devotionalism associated with Mathura is  less convincing.  82 Thapar 1961: 182–196. 83 Falk 2006: 270 ff.; Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 259; Thapar 1961: 186–187. 84 Lamotte 1988 [1958]: 246–248; Strong 1983: 268–286; Thapar 1961: 185. </page> <page sequence="30"> 94 chapter two making donations to the Buddhist san֛gha.85 The last Mauryan ruler,  according to purānsic sources, was Brshadratha, who was overthrown  by his Brahmin general Pusysamitra, the founder of the Śun֛ga dynasty,  around 185 BCE.86 Historians have attributed the rapid decline of  the Mauryas within a span of less than fifty years after Aśoka’s death  to the impossibility of administering such an immense territitory, a  cumbersome bureaucracy, an economic crisis marked my devaluation  of Mauryan coinage, Brahmanical reaction to official patronage of  Buddhists and other śramansas, and the failure of Aśoka’s nonviolent  Dharma policy to meet the needs of governance or to fufill Ksastriya  norms. While a completely satisfying explanation can not be offered  here, the salient point to note is that political and religious dynamics  of the Mauryan period provided a crucial impetus for the expansion  of Buddhist institutions, which survived the downfall of the dynasty of  the Buddhist tradition’s most famous patron. Migrations, Material Exchanges, and Cross-Cultural Transmission in  Northwestern Contact Zones Movements of people, materials, languages, symbols, and religious  ideas and rituals have had numerous impacts on the northwestern  frontier of South Asia, which was never an isolated or static enclave.  Multiple itineraries used by exogenous migrants for crossing rivers  (particularly the Indus and its tributaries in the Punjab), mountain  ranges (such as the Hindu Kush, Pamirs, and Karakorum), and des- erts demonstrate that permeable geographical boundaries did not hin- der mobility. A brief treatment of much earlier material exchanges  and migrations introduces themes of contact and mobility, thus set- ting the stage for the arrival of various groups in the northwestern  borderlands after the collapse of the Mauryans in the early second  century BCE.

Old Persian inscriptions  of Darius I (522–486 BCE) and Xerxes (486–465 BCE) indicate that  Gandhāra (Gadāra) and Sindh (Hiduš) in present-day northwestern  and southern Pakistan were the easternmost Achaemenid provinces.91  Relying on the account of Scylax of Caryanda, the Greek historian  Herodotus (4.44) briefly refers to an expedition sent by Darius I to  explore the Indus River around 518–519 BCE.92 This account seems  to confirm that the lower Indus valley was included in the domain of  Darius I, who received 360 talents of powdered gold in tribute from  this province, thus exceeding the amount of revenue from any other  province.93 Despite these epigraphic and literary references to Achae- menid tributary provinces in India, it is important to acknowledge  significant differences between official images and the difficult reality  of administering an empire extending from the Mediterranean to the  Indus. Pierre Briant wisely cautions: 91 For editions and translations of Old Persian inscriptions, see Kent, Roland. 1953.  Old Persian: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon. 2nd rev. ed.

References by  Herodotus (3.91–94) to the tribute received by Darius from Asia and his account  of the expansion of the Achaemenid empire to the east are discussed by Karttunen  1989: 32–38, Parker 2008: 21–28, and Vogelsang 1992: 200–207. Fleming, David. 1993.  “Where was Achaemenid India?” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 7, 67–72, suggests that  Taxila may have been the capital of the “Indian” satrapy. 92 Briant 2002 [1996]: 140, 904; Karttunen 1989: 40–48, 65–68; Parker 2008:  14–18. 93 Herodotus (3.94–95) calculates that 360 talents of gold-dust annually received  by Darius from the twentieth satrapy of India (the lower Indus) is equivalent to 4680  silver talents, since gold is worth thirteen times the value of silver. The story relayed by  Herodotus (3.98, 102–105) of how the Indians acquired such a large supply of gold by  using great ants “in size somewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes” (Rawlinson,  George, trans. 1942. The Persian Wars. New York: Random House, 262) raises suspi- cions about the credibility of this figure. Tarn 1985 [1951]: 108 dismisses the story, but  Karttunen 1989: 37–38, 171–176 discusses possible sources for the story of the gold- digging ants and points out that the source of the gold was not the lower Indus.  </page> <page sequence="33">  historical contexts 97 It appears clear that neither the country lists nor the depictions of peo- ples are intended to give a realistic picture of the administration or the  geography of the Empire. Instead, the lists and depictions are primarily  the vehicles of the very idea of royal and imperial power. (Briant 2002  [1996]: 183) The extent of direct Achaemenid control over the northwestern Indian  subcontinent remains unclear, especially in regard to Taxila and areas  east of the Indus River. Fragmentary accounts of the Persika and Indika attributed to Cte- sias of Knidos, a Greek physician who served in the Achaemenid  court for sixteen or seventeen years until 398/7 BCE, illustrate how  fantastic and factual information about India was filtered to a Greek  audience through Iran.94 Unfortunately, Ctesias’ account of the Achae- menid network of routes across the Iranian plateau and western Cen- tral Asia to the Indian subcontinent has not survived, since the ‘Royal  Road’ between Sardis and Susa described by Herodotus (5.52–4) was  “just one royal road among many others” (Briant 2002 [1996]: 357).95  As Pierre Briant comments, “. . . many other itineraries, often much  shorter and often following mountain or desert routes, are left out”  and “It was in fact impossible to travel by such routes without local  guides” (2002 [1996]: 360). While official documents indicate that the  main roads primarily served political and military purposes, Briant  observes that “information on customs and tolls seems to confirm the  breadth and density of trade” (387). Cross-cultural borrowings from Achaemenid Iran were certainly  possible, but Indian sources do not explicitly refer to transmission  94 Karttunen 1989: 80–85 discuses the “bad reputation” (80) of Ctesias among clas- sical authors and modern scholars, but cautions that “we cannot always use modern  criteria when judging ancient authors” (81). Karttunen’s observation that authors like  Herodotus and Megasthenes who are viewed as (relatively) more trustworthy were  also “fond of marvels” (82) is contested by Parker, who argues that “The marvel, so  important to Ctesias’ ethnography with its tendencies towards natural history, became  an embarrassment to the development of a new kind of historiography that was begin- ning to emerge” (30–31). Parker reviews current scholarship, including a commen- tary on fragments attributed to Ctesias by Lenfant, Dominique. 2004. La Perse; l’Inde;  autres fragments.

The derivation of the Kharostshsī script from Ara- maic, which was used throughout the Achaemenid realm, is relatively  straightforward, but the development of Brāhmī as a chancellery script  for writing Aśokan inscriptions may have also been related to an effort  to emulate the royal inscriptions of Achaemenid or later Seleukid rul- ers.96 Achaemenid influences on Mauryan art and architecture have  also been suggested, but the evidence for this period of Indian art is  very limited.97 The possibility of Iranian influences on later layers of  rock art in the Upper Indus valley is stronger, but Achaemenid sources  seem unlikely. Nevertheless, the long period of Achaemenid control  (however nominal) of the northwestern borderlands prior to the con- quests of Alexander of Macedon is likely to have enhanced its already  hybrid Indo-Iranian culture by opening additional channels of trade,  travel and communication. Hellenistic Interactions Alexander’s attempt to invade India initiated cross-cultural interac- tions between Hellenistic and South Asian civilizations in the contact  zones between the Indus and Oxus rivers. After conquering the Achae- menid heartland of ancient Iran following the battle of Gaugamela  in 331 BCE, Alexander of Macedon led a large military expedition  to Central Asia (Bactria and Sogdia) and the northwestern regions of  South Asia (Gandhāra, Punjab, and the lower Indus) between 330–325  BCE.98 Since he retreated down the Indus River following a difficult  expedition rather than pursing further conquests in the Indian sub- continent, the question of whether he intended to subdue only the  eastern borderlands of the Achaemenid empire or to complete a world  96 Falk 1993: 92–104, 337–340; Salomon 1998a: 28–30, 51–54; Salomon 2003a: 88,  92–93. 97 Thapar 1961: 129, 266–270. 98 Alexander’s campaigns in Central Asia and South Asia have received consider- able attention.

I, unfortunate Sophytos,  scion of the family of Naratos, quite young and deprived of the wealth  of my family, who had cultivated the arts of Apollo the archer and the  Muses together with the virtue of wisdom, considered how to restore my  ancestors’ house to a new grandeur. Having borrowed money to make  it fructify, I left my country, determined not to return before amassing  a great fortune. Therefore, I took up commerce in many cities. I accu- mulated great wealth without suffering any harm. Here I am, having  returned after innumerable years to my fatherland, with much praise  and amidst my friends’ rejoicing. And at one and the same time, I have  reconsctructed and beautified my ancestors’ house, which was dilapi- dated, and since the family tomb had fallen to the ground, I rebuilt a new  one. And I had this stele erected next to the road so that it will speak  thus: look at my accomplishements. Well worthy to be imitated. May my  sons and grandsons preserve the house which they owe to me.102  99 In assessing the legacy of Alexander in Asia, Holt emphasizes that “We might  avoid preconceptions about Alexander’s personality and impact by asking what the  king did rather than dreamt . . .” (1989: 8).

Excavations by the French  Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan between 1965–1978 revealed  Greek and Iranian temples, a gymnasium, a theatre, an arsenal, and a  palace, as well as Greek dedicatory and funerary inscriptions and cop- ies of Delphic maxims set up by Clearchus of Soli.104 Archaeological,  epigraphic, and numismatic evidence for the presence of Greek colo- nists and Hellenized local inhabitants at Ai Khanum (until its aban- donment around 145 BCE) demonstrates that long-distance contacts  and exchanges between the Mediterranean, Iranian, and Indian worlds  continued long after the period of Alexander’s expedition. Although  Alexander was not remembered in ancient South Asian sources, recent  discoveries associated with his successors who adapted to dynamic  political, economic, and religious conditions in borderland outposts  challenge the earlier assessments of W.W. Tarn and A.K. Narain, who  juxtaposed imperialistic Greeks to proto-nationalistic Indians.105 arachchi and Boussac 2005: 127–136.

According to Rougemont (2004: 240–241, 2005: 131), the phrase “I took up commerce  in many cities” recalls the 3rd verse of Homer’s Odyssey, reflecting a widely invoked  topos of the itinerant life in funerary poems across the Hellenistic world. 104 Bernard, Paul et al. 1973–1992.

A.K. Narain, held that the impact of Alexander’s  successors was very limited: “Their history is part of the history of India and not of the  Hellenistic states; they came, they saw, but India conquered” (1957: 11). 106 Holt, Frank. 1999.

Although his predecessor  Demetrius is usually regarded as the first Greek ruler to have made  conquests south of the Hindu Kush,109 on the basis of a recent dis- covery of a Kharostshsī inscription dated in year 201 “of the Greeks”  ( yonsansa) and year 73 of the Azes era beginning in 58/7 BCE, Richard  Salomon argues that Agathokles may have been responsible for initiat- ing an “Indo-Greek era” in 186/5 BCE.110 In addition to instituting the  first continuous historical era, the Indo-Greek rulers also left imprints  in the form of military and political titles, Macedonian month names  used in epigraphical dating formulae, and the use of the Greek alpha- bet for writing the Bactrian language. Contact and exchange was gen- erally limited to the northwestern frontiers, where layers of Hellenistic  influence persisted after the last Indo-Greek rulers disappeared from  the political scene in the first century BCE. The presence of Indo-Greeks in the Northwest during the last two  centuries BCE has stimulated debates about their responses to reli- gious and cultural features of the Indo-Iranian borderland environ- ment. Although many deities depicted on their coins belonged to the  Hellenistic pantheon, Indo-Greek rulers from Agathokles onwards (as  well as Sakas, Parthians, and Kusāsnsas) adopted a wide range of Ira- nian and Indian deities, Buddhist symbols, and South Asian titles and  109 Karttunen 1997a: 273–4 discusses the extent of the Indian domains of Demetrius  based on literary references, which also associate Greek conquests of India after Alex- ander with Apollodotus and Menander. A recently discovered Greek inscription of  Heliodotus (Bernard, et al. 2004: 333 ff.; Rougemont 2005: 133–4, fig. 2) from Kuliab  in Tajikistan recording a dedication to Hestia refers to Demetrius as a “glorious vic- tor” (kallinikos is a laudative epithet) and to his father Euthydemos as “the greatest of  all kings” but does not indicate that their dominion extended beyond ancient Bactria.  MacDowall, David. 2005. “The Role of Demetrius in Arachosia and the Kabul Valley.”  In Bopearachchi and Boussac 2005: 197–206 focuses on the silver and copper coins of  Demetrius (also see MacDowall 2007: 99).  110 Salomon, Richard. 2005a. “The Indo-Greek Era of 186/5 BC in a Buddhist Reli- quary Inscription.” In Bopearachchi and Boussac 2005: 359–401 (CKI 405: http:// www.ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0405). Salomon discusses other Brāhmī,  Kharostshsī, and Bactrian inscriptions that may be dated in this era, which is explicitly  attested in a Brāhmī inscription in year 116 “of the reign of the Yavanas” ( yavanara- jyasya), which would correspond to ca. 70 BCE. Jakobsson, Jens. 2009. “Who Founded  the Indo-Greek Era of 186/5 BCE?” Classical Quarterly 59.2, 505–510 speculates that  the era may have been promoted by Menander and Antimachus II.

Tarn attempted to explain Indo-Greek patronage of  Buddhism as a strategy to gain local support against Indian rulers such  as Pusysamitra, who seized power after the collapse of the Mauryans  and restored Brahmanical institutions, according to Sanskrit purānsic  traditions.112 Such a juxtaposition between foreign Greek supporters of  Buddhism in the Northwest and traditional Indian kings who main- tained “Hindu” orthodoxy oversimplifies more complex patterns of  religious patronage of multiple South Asian religious traditions. Greek patronage of Buddhism is most clearly associated with  Menander, a powerful Indo-Greek ruler of the Punjab and northwest- ern India around 150 BCE who issued numerous coins and is known  in both Buddhist and western classical literary traditions.113 However,  Menander’s silver coins showing Athena in various martial poses do  not indicate a Buddhist affiliation and his bronze coins depict an eclec- 111 Karttunen 1997a: 309–315 discusses the representation and localization of Greek  gods and the representation of local gods in Greek form. In “The Greek Kingdoms of  Central Asia” (in Harmatta 1994: 98–129), Paul Bernard observes that “With very few  exceptions, the official state pantheon was entirely Greek” (1994b: 114), but temples  dedicated to local and Iranian deities at Ai Khanum “owed nothing to Greek tradi- tion” (ibid., 115). Bernard ameliorates this apparent discrepancy between numismatic  iconography and religious architecture, archaeology and art by commenting that “the  Greeks themselves had probably never, except in their own official state religion, put  up any barriers between their own gods and those of their subjects, and so had paved  the way to their progressive assimilation” (127).

In adopting South Asian models of religious patronage, the dis- tinctive identity of the Indo-Greeks eventually disappeared as they  became fully Indianized. While King Menander is praised as a Bud- dhist patron (if not a convert), a Greek ambassador ( yonadūta) named  Hēliodōros sent from Taxila to Vidiśā in central India by the Indo- Greek king Antialkidas, refers to himself as a devotee (bhāgavata)  of Visnssu in a late second century BCE Brāhmī inscription (fig. 2.1:  Heliodoros Pillar).118 Hēliodōros donated a pillar of Garudsa, the eagle  who serves as Visnssu’s animal emblem, during his visit to the court  of Kāśīputra Bhāgabhadra, whom historians have attempted to iden- tify with Śun֛ga kings listed in purānsic genealogies such as Bhadraka/ Odraka or Bhāga(-vata).119 Some Greek names and titles also appear  in Buddhist inscriptions from the Northwest and in Buddhist cave  inscriptions from western India.120 However, references to Yavana (or  Press, “A hero cult involves setting apart one particular grave, known as a heroon,  from other burials by marking off a special precinct, by bringing sacrifices and votive  gifts, and occasionally by building a special grave monument” (1985: 203). Burkert’s  comments about connections between the rise and popularity of hero cults during  Hellenistic times and the establishment of “effectice presence” in a “specific locality”  suggest structural resonances with Buddhist relic cults that may have appealed to a  Greek audience in the Northwest. 118 Salomon 1998a: 265–267 (Appendix 2: Besnagar Pillar Inscription of Hēliodōros,  fig. 12, with further references on p. 266). 119 Sircar, Dineschandra. 1965.

However, this identification is dismissed by Narain 1957: 119, who instead identifies  Bhāgabhadra with the ninth Śun֛ga king known as Bhāga or Bhāgavata. A Śun ֛ga con- netion remains hypothetical, since Kāśiputra Bhāgabhadra may have been a local or  regional ruler of Vidiśā. 120 Fussman 1994a: 26 points out that only the Kharostshsī inscription of the Meri- darch Theodoros may belong to the period of the Indo-Greek rulers in the Northwest,  although other Greek names appear in later inscriptions. Since very few Kharostshsī  inscriptions (with the exception of the Aśokan edicts) can be dated before ca. 50 BCE,  it would be misleading to conclude that “This lack of information on the Greeks in the  inscriptions of Gandhāra and Panjab seems to indicate that there was no noticeable  Greek influence on Buddhism . . .” (Dietz, Siglinde. 2007. “Buddhism in Gandhāra.” In  Heirman and Bumbacher 2007: 56).

Alfred Foucher strongly advocated for the importance of an amal- gamation of Hellenistic models with Indian and Iranian traditions  in the Buddhist art of Gandhāra.121 However, Foucher’s theory of a  “Graeco-Buddhist” school of art and his arguments for a Greek ori- gin of anthropomorphic images of the Buddha remain controversial.122  Foucher and other proponents of Hellenistic influences in Gandhāran  Buddhist art have struggled to explain a chronological gap between  the heyday of Indo-Greek rule in the Northwest in the second cen- tury BCE and the first appearance of identifiable Hellenistic features  in Buddhist art of Gandhāra only in the first century CE.123 Lamotte,  for example, acknowledged that “. . . this influence took a long time to  become apparent and that although it was implanted during the Indo- Greek occupation, it did not bear fruit until first the Śaka-Pahlava  period, and then the Kusāsnsa” (1988 [1958]: 429). This problematic  lag between the hypothetical ‘implantation’ and concrete ‘manifes- tation’ of a proposed Hellenistic ‘synthesis’ in Gandhāran Buddhist  art raises questions about the impetus, extent, and significance of  the long survival of Greek stylistic features, which were transmitted  through numerous intermediaries and are more related to technical  Culture 1, 343–357 (= Stein, Otto. 1985.

Relationships between Iranian and Hellenistic cultures and the  Buddhist traditions of Gandhāra and Central Asia are addressed fur- ther in Old Roads in the Northwestern Borderlands (Chapter 4) and  Long-Distance Transmission to Central Asian Silk Routes and China  (Chapter 6). A tendency of many earlier scholars such as Foucher  and Lamotte to overemphasize the impact of the Achaemenids and  Indo-Greeks on the history of Buddhism has been counterbalanced  by efforts to downplay ‘foreign’ influence. Interactions between Brah- mins who were already well established in the region since vedic times,  Buddhist newcomers, socially assimilated exogenous migrant groups,  and local intermediaries (like Sophytos) who appropriated Iranian and  Greek languages, writing systems, titles, customs, and ideas for their  own political and economic benefit contributed to dynamic hybridity.127  124 Fussman, while accepting the possibility of a “synthèse hellénico-Bouddhique”  (1994a: 27) long after the end of Indo-Greek political domination, argues that the  artistic traditions of Gandhāran Buddhism are ideologically identical to those of  Mathura and Amarāvatī.  125 Taddei, Maurizio. 2003.

Saka Migrants and Mediators between Central Asia and South Asia As Indo-Greek power waned, various groups of Sakas established con- trol of important nodes on networks of long-distance routes used for  migrations, trade, and cultural transmission between Central Asia,  the Iranian borderlands, and the northwestern Indian subcontinent.128  Their domination of overland routes corresponds to a critical period  of heightened patronage and growth of Buddhist institutions in the  first century BCE and first century CE. The profound impact of the  Sakas in South Asia is gaining greater recognition, although many  previous scholars regarded the Sakas (sometimes called Indo-Scythi- ans) as mere imitators of their Indo-Greek predecessors. For example,  W.W. Tarn opined that the “Sacas simply stepped into the shoes of  the Greeks” (1984 [1951]: 323). Subsequent Kusāsnsa dominion over a  more extensive empire extending from Bactria to northeastern India  has overshadowed Saka precedents. Finally, the conflation of Sakas  (Śakas) with other immigrant goups (including the Indo-Greek yava- nas and Iranian pahlavas) has obscured their position.

In addition to linguistic borrowings of Iranian loanwords into Sanskrit  and Prakrit languages, the initial use of Sanskrit in official inscrip- tions and the adoption of poetic conventions (kāvya) in epigraphic  eulogies (praśastis) are connected with Saka centers in Mathura and  Gujarat during the first two centuries CE.130 The active role of Sakas  as patrons of Buddhist literature, art and archeology is apparent in  early Buddhist manuscripts from Gandhāra, pre-Kusāsnsa sculptures  from Mathura, and Kharostshsī and Brāhmī inscriptions from north- western and western regions of South Asia, but they also supported  other religious groups as well.131 Sakas and other Iranian and Central  Asian immigrants were not merely passive converts to Buddhism, but  played active roles as mediators for the trans-cultural flow of Bud- dhism beyond India. Saka migrations to South Asia Saka immigrants, who began to arrive in South Asia around the  beginning of the first century BCE, belonged to separate branches of  nomadic and sedentary groups that inhabited areas of Central Asia  extending from the Pontic steppes north of the Black Sea to western  Mongolia. Peoples known as Sakas in Iranian and Kharostshsī inscrip- tions, Śakas in Sanskrit, and Scythians in western classical sources are  broadly associated with material cultures and artistic styles classified  as the “Scythian triad” (consisting of bronze and iron weapons, horse- 130 Damsteegt 1978: 204–216; Sheldon Pollock comments: “The radical reinvention  of Sanskrit culture seems to have occurred—at least, it is here that we can actually  watch it occurring—precisely where one might expect it, in a social world where the  presuppositions and conventions of the vaidika culture were weakest: among newly  immigrant peoples from the far northwest of the subcontinent (and ultimately from  Iran and Central Asia), most importantly the Śakas (the so-called Indo-Scythians),  especially a branch of the Śakas known as the Western Ksastrapas, and the Kusāsnsas”  (2006: 67).

Before the period of migration to South Asia, three distinct groups of  Sakas appear in Achaemenid monumental art and Old Persian inscrip- tions issued during the reign of Darius I (522–486 BCE): 1) Sakas “who are across the sea” (paradraya) in areas north of the  Black Sea are mentioned only in the Naqš-i Rustam inscription,  but Herodotus (4.1–162) provides many details about this group of  Scythians in his account of the Darius I’s campaign against them  (ca. 513 BCE).133 2) Sakas “wearing the pointed cap” (tigraxauda) correspond with the  Sakas or Scythians with “pointed helmets” (Greek: orthokoryban- tioi) listed by Herodotus (3.92) in the tenth satrapy of Media. In  addition to the Naqš-i Rustam inscription, an inscription of Darius  at Susa and an inscription of Xerxes from Persepolis refer to this  group of Sakas.134 3) “Hauma-drinking” (haumavarga) Sakas appear together with the  previous group in Old Persian inscriptions and are referred to as  Amyrgian Scythians by Herodotus (7.64).135 They originally inhab- ited regions around the Syr Darya (Jaxartes River) in the Ferghana  and Alai valleys of western Central Asia, but also settled in the  Helmand valley and southeastern Iran (Seistan).136 Since this region  around the Hamun Lake “is a land where the steppe and the sown  are intermingled and nomads are on all sides of the lake which is  large in winter while almost vanishing in the late summer” (Frye  132 The Scythian triad and Central Asian burial practices are discussed by Di Cosmo  2002: 32–42, Jettmar, Karl. 1967.

Vogelsang (1992: 304–315)  argues that the Sakas who infiltrated eastern Iran from areas to the  north during the first half of the first millennium BCE played major  roles in the establishement and maintenance of Achaemenid power.  According to Vogelsang, Saka migrations to the Iranian plateau and  onwards to the Near East or to the Indian subcontinent can be viewed  as a recurring pattern in which nomadic migrants from Central Asia  initially disrupted settled life, but eventually “. . . were adopted within  local structures, and either disappeared from view as a distinct eth- nic unity, or turned into the new ruling class of the sedentary people,  often mingling with the old group of the autochthonous population”  (1992: 305). This characterization aids in understanding patterns of  migration of exogenous Sakas to northwestern India towards the end  of the first millennium BCE, although it is not necessarily the case that  all of these groups came to South Asia from eastern Iran.

While the Chinese character transliterated as Sai or Se (pro- nounced *sәk/sәg/seg) corresponds closely enough to Iranian Saka,  Gāndhārī Saga, and Sanskrit Śaka, distinctions between the Sakas  and other groups are not always clear (as is also the case with Ira- nian and western classical sources describing Central Asian nomadic  movements).140 Geographical details about Saka migrations beyond the  Western Region (Xiyu) are somewhat vague, but the Chinese sources  nevertheless indicate that at least one branch of Sakas began to move  into the northwestern Indian subcontinent without passing through  the Iranian plateau. A passage in the Han shu (96B.1b) specifies that  the Sai crossed the “hanging passage” (xuan du), located between  Shatial and Swat in the gorges of the upper Indus River in modern  Pakistan.141 Han shu (96A.10b) also indicates that the Sakas eventu- ally conquered Jibin, a territory commonly associated with Kashmir  or Kapiśa (Begram in Afghanistan), but here perhaps referring to  Gandhāra.142 During the final two centuries BCE, three separate groups of Sakas  migrated to South Asia via overland routes from southeastern Iran,  Bactria, and the Tarim Basin.143 Despite topographical difficulties  of the proposed routes from eastern Central Asia across the Pamir  and Karakorum mountains to Swat and Gandhāra, artifacts from  the Pamir region and bronze objects with Scythian stylistic affinities  from mountain valleys in northern Pakistan and the late survival of  140 Hulsewé (1979: 104, fn. 210) transliterates Sai while Thierry (2005: 451, fn. 39)  uses Se.

Since Indo-Greek kings appear to have remained  in control of Kapiśa during the second century BCE, a Saka military  conquest does not appear to have been likely, but a series of nomadic  movements may have been partially responsible for the displacement  of Greek rulers first from Bactria and again from Gandhāra, Taxila and  the Punjab in the middle of the first century BCE.147 A third wave of  Sakas migrated to the western borderlands of South Asia from Seistan  in southeastern Iran and Arachosia in southern Afghanistan after a  series of conflicts with the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia between 130–80  144 Dani, Ahmad Hasan. 1989.

Saka Rulers in the Northwest Numismatic sequences and dated inscriptions are the primary sources  for reconstructing chronological frameworks for the dynastic history  of Saka rulers in the northwestern and western Indian subcontinent in  the first century BCE and eary centuries CE. Greek and Kharostshsī coin  legends indicate that Maues (or Moa in Kharostshsī) was the first Śaka  ruler to declare himself “king of kings” (Greek: ƅƄƕƌƎƈƛƕ ƅƄƕƌƎƈƛΝ/ Kharostshsī: rajatiraja) in areas of Gandhāra, Swat, and Taxila in the  early first century BCE.149 Since his coins are more commonly found  in areas of northwestern Pakistan rather than in regions around Kabul  or in southeastern Afghanistan, he and his predescessors probably fol- lowed routes from the north across the Hindu Kush, Pamir, or possibly  the Karakorum mountains rather than migrating from southeastern  Iran, Afghanistan, and the lower Indus, as sometimes suggested.150  148 Justin (42.1–2) provides an account of relationships with the Sakas during the  reigns of Phraates II (who died in 138 BCE during a campaign against the Sakas) and  Mithridates II (123–88 BCE), who reached an accommodation with the Sakas (Konow  1929: xxxvii–xxxix; Lamotte 1988: 451–2, Narain 1957: 140–141, Senior 2001: 11–12,  Tarn 1984 [1951]: 320). 149 Maues’ coinage is treated by Bopearachchi, Osmund. 1999. “Recent Coin Hoard  Evidence on Pre-Kushana Chronology.” In Alram and Klimburg-Salter 1999: 124– 126; Jenkins, G.K. 1955. “Indo-Scythic mints.” Journal of the Numismatic Society of  India 17, 1–26; Konow 1929: xxix–xxxi; Rapson, E.J. 1922. “The Scythian and Parthian  Invaders.” In Cambridge History of India, vol. 1, ed.

In contrast, the hypothesis of Bivar, A.D.H. 1984. “Maues at Taxila:  Problems of his Arrival-Route and Political Allegiance.” Journal of Central Asia 7.1,  14 that Maues or his predecessors migrated from areas in the north (Hazara and  Kashmir) to Gandhara and Taxila in the south is also supported by Narain 1957: 145  ff., and Senior 2001: 29–34.  </page> <page sequence="52"> 116 chapter two In addition to issues of coins that reflect his major position as a pow- erful regional ruler in the Northwest, a Kharostshsī inscription record- ing the establishment of Buddhist relics in Taxila dated in year 78 “of  Mahārāja Moga the Great” (maharayasa mahamstasa mogasa) indicates  that Saka ksastrapas (“Satraps”) acknowedged his importance by using  a continuous era named after him, although this inscription is the sin- gle attestation of such a reckoning system.151 While Maues himself is  not directly connected with material evidence of Buddhist patronage,  he appears to have initiated a decentralized administrative network of  Saka mahāksastrapas, ksastrapas and loosely affiliated subordinates who  were avid Buddhist donors.152 The most prominent successor of Maues was Azes (Aya in Kharostshsī),  who also declared himself “King of Kings” on widespread and volu- minous issues of coins following the decline of Indo-Greek rulers,  from whom he adopted depictions of Hellenistic deities.153 Since Azes  initially issued coins jointly with Spalirises, an Indo-Parthian official,  he appears to have expanded his dominion to Taxila and other areas  of northwestern Pakistan from a base in the region of Arachosia in  southeastern Afghanistan rather than directly inheriting the regions  previously ruled by Maues.154 Azes’ likely successors (Azilises and  151 The copper plate Kharostshsī inscription of Patika is edited by Konow 1929: 23–29,  no. 13, pl. 5.1 (= CKI 46: http://www.ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0046),  but an identification of the era of year 78 remains disputed.

However, as observed by Glass, Andrew. 2007b. “The Chronology of  Kharostshsī Inscriptions: A reassessment in light of recent discoveries.” Gandhāran  Studies 1, 61–76, these solutions result in dates for Patika and his father, ksastrapa  Liaka Kusulaka, that are too early for them to also appear in Kharostshsī inscriptions  on the Mathura lion capital.  152 Salomon, Richard. 1974. “The Ksastrapas and Mahāksastrapas of India.” Wiener  Zeitschrift für die Kunde Südasiens 18, 5–25 concludes that these titles attested in  Indian coins and inscriptions denote regional subordinates and semi-independent or  independent rulers depending on the political context. 153 Mitchener 1976: vol. 6 (Dynasty of Azes), 481–504; Rosenfield, John M. 1967.

Robert Senior links Azes with “uni- fication of the Punjab and a great increase of wealth, evidenced by  his huge output of coinage” as well as “a revolution in religious ideas  brought about by the cultural mix resultant from his sitting at the hub  of the Silk route” (2001: 65). Such an assessment of Azes’ legacy may  be exaggerated by a narrow emphasis on numismatic sources, since  Azes, like Maues, is not directly connected to patronage of religious  institutions and is not mentioned in literary sources. Nevertheless, the  consolidation of Saka power after Azes began to rule in 58 BCE by  a confederation of regional rulers who established control of major  routes connecting Gandhāra to Mathura had significant implications  for political, economic, and religious history. Buddhist Patronage by the Apracas and Odsis Regional Saka subordinates, allies, and officials supported Buddhist  institutions by donating relics, building stūpas, and giving donations  to monastic communities in their domains. Members of the Apraca  155 Although most other numismatic specialists maintain that the “spear versus  whip” criterion for distinguishing coins of Azes I from those of Azes II “holds reason- ably well for separating earlier and later Azes’ coins” (Mitchener 1976: 6.481), Senior  2001: 63, 71, 83 argues that Azilises’ coins follow those of Maues and precede issues  of Azes and dismisses the distinction between Azes I and II by regarding later coins  of Azes as posthumous issues. While the relative chronological sequence remains dis- puted (and it is beyond my scope to resolve numismatic debates), it is interesting to  note that horseriders with whips also appear in petroglyphs from various sites (Hodar,  Gichi Nala, Chilas, Thalpan, and Hunza-Haldeikish) in northern Pakistan, but it is not  very clear that Azes’ coinage was the source of this imagery.  156 Salomon 1998: 182 briefly explains the use of the Azes/Vikrama era in Indian  inscriptions. Falk 2002: 85–87 observes that this era first attested 63 years after Azes  began to reign in the Indravarman casket corresponding to 5/6 CE may have been  a “creation in hindsight” (Schöpfung im Nachhinein).

A silver drinking vessel with an animal-style ibex  figure formerly belonging to the “Yagu king” ( yaguraño) Kharayosta  (or Kharaosta) that was rededicated as a Buddhist reliquary by Indra- varman (Aśpavarman’s father) may indicate that this object was  given to the Apracas as a gift in exchange for some form of tribute  or assistance.162 The Apracas were also connected by marital alliance  with the Odsi kings in the Swat valley, since a royal relative and officer  named Suhasoma in a Budddhist reliquary inscription of Senavarman  (Fig. 2.2: Reliquary Stūpa of Senavarman, the King of Odsi) was  married to Vasavadattā, according to a Kharostshsī inscription record- ing her donation of a waterpot.163 Vasavadattā, the donor of the water- pot, may be identified with the sister of the Apraca prince Indravarma,  since she is mentioned in a Kharostshsī reliquary casket inscription.164  Since Senavarman’s inscription mentioning Suhasoma also refers to  Sadasksansa, a son of the first Kusāsnsa ruler Kujula Kadphises, the role of  the Apracas and Odsi rulers as powerful regional Buddhist patrons can  be synchronized with the early Kusāsnsas during a period of dynamic  religious activity and political fluctuations at the beginning of the first  century CE.165 161 Senior 2001: 92–94.  162 This interpretation of CKI 21 (http://www.ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid= CKI0241) is suggested by Salomon 1996b: 442–443.  163 Salomon 1999a: 152–155, 198–199 (British Library pot A, inscription 2 = CKI  369: http://www.ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0369); Salomon 2007: 276– 277.

A relatively long  passage written on top and on back of a rectangular block joining the  adorsed lions commemorates the installation of Buddhist relics and  donation of a stūpa and monastery to a Sarvāstivādin monastic com- munity by the “Chief Queen” (agramahesis) of Mahāksastrapa Rajula.  Although the phrasing is ambiguous, her name may be understood as  a compound, Ayasia Kamuia, or as Ayasia, the daughter (dhitra) of  the Kamu[ia]. She was apparently the daughter of Kharaosta, whose  name appears twice in the Mathura lion capital inscriptions with the  title of “heir apparent” ( yuvaraña and yuvaraya in Gāndhārī corre- spond to Sanskrit yuvarāja). Since Kharayosta (a variant of Kharaosta)  is identified as a Mahāksastrapa’s son in a Kharostshsī inscription on the  silver goblet rededicated as a Buddhist reliquary by the Apraca prince  Indravarman, the Mathura lion capital inscriptions indicate kinship  connections between the family of Mathura Ksastrapas and Saka lin- eages in the Northwest.167 Another Mathura lion capital inscription refers to Mahāksastrapa  Kusula Patika, who can be identified with the donor (mahādānapati)  of Buddhist relics named Patika, the son of Liaka Kusulaka, the  Ksastrapa of Cukhsa, according to a Kharostshsī inscription from  166 Konow 1929: 30–49, no. 15, pls.

Although Konow attempts to read and interpret the haphazardly written inscriptions  on the lion capital as a single epigraphic record, Sircar and Thomas split the inscrip- tions into separate groups. The Kharostshsī characters vary in size, but do not appear  to have been written by separate hands at different times. John Rosenfield suggested  that “. . . a ceremonial gathering at Mathurā of a large number of Śaka princes” (1967:  134) may have served as a context for writing these records, which resemble informal  graffiti. 167 Salomon 1996b: 424 (Inscription II: mahaksastrapa-putrasa [ya]guramsña khara- [yosta]sa . . .

Since Kharayosta has the title of Yabgu-king ( yaguramsña) in this inscription and the  title of heir-apparent ( yuvaraya) in the Mathura lion capital inscriptions, it is likely  that the Mathura inscriptions were written before he was elevated to the position of  Yabgu-king. Yabgu, a Central Asian title corresponding to Chinese xihou, was adopted  in Kusāsnsa coin legends (Hulsewé 1979: 121–123, Rosenfield 1967: 11, Thierry 2005:  462–469, 498).

Kharostshsī inscriptions  written on the bottom surface of the Mathura lion capital call for the  honor (puyae for Sanskrit pūjāyai) of the donation to extend to “all  Buddhas, the Dharma, and the Sangha” and to “all of Sakastan.” The  somewhat unusual use of the formula with Sakastana may reflect some  conception of a Saka domain in the northwestern Indian subconti- nent. By establishing themselves as powerful rulers and administrators  in Mathura, Taxila, and the Punjab, the Sakas controlled a network  of routes that connected the northwestern frontiers with the Indian  heartland. Indo-Parthians: Mahārāja Gondophares or the Gondopharids? By the middle of the first century CE, Saka Ksastrapas and Mahāksastrapas  in the Northwest evidently served under the nominal authority of  Indo-Parthian rulers related to Mahārāja Gondophares. However, the  interpretation of numismatic and epigraphic sources for the reign of  Gondophares is complicated by the “homonymy problem” (Alram 1999,  37, fn. 123) of several kings with this name or title meaning ‘winner  of glory’ during the late first century BCE and early first century CE.170  168 Konow 1929: 23–29, no. 13, pl.

However, Senior’s challenge to the general consensus for dating  Gondophares I from c. 19–46+ CE has not received much support (Srivastava 2007:  85–92).  171 According to Fussman, Gérard. 1998.

Although chronological details remain disputed and the role of  the Gondopharid dynasty in political history before the advent of the  Kusāsnsas is still not clearly understood, Indo-Parthian hegemony in  the Northwest in the middle of the first century CE corresponded with  “a period of great prosperity and cultural achievement” (Rosenfield  1967: 129). that an Indo-Parthian ruler with this name was still known in Syria after c. 250 CE,  but do not provide evidence that St. Thomas actually met him or that he controlled  Taxila. 172 Alram 1999, 37–44; Bopearachchi, 1993, 59–60; Bopearachchi and Pieper 1998,  219–223; Bopearachchi 1999, 135–136; Mitchener 1976, 5.393–394, 8.697–719; Senior  2001, 1.108–128, 2.148–158.  173 Konow 1929: 57–62, no. 20, pl.

Fynes, R.C.C. 1995. “Religious Patronage of the Sātavāhana Dynasty.” South  Asian Studies 11, 43–50 supports an identification with regnal years of Nahapāna,  corresponding to a period between 66—71 CE. Senior 2001: 132 reckons the years  according to the Azes/Vikrama era of 58/7 BCE, resulting in c. 17–12/11 BCE, but  placing Nahapāna before the Common Era creates insurmountable problems of rela- tive chronology. </page> <page sequence="63">  historical contexts 127 to c. 40–70 CE.181 While secure dates for Nahapāna’s period are elu- sive, overstrikes of his coins by the Sātavāhana ruler Gautamīputra  Sātakarnsi, who is praised for destroying the Śakas, Yavanas, and Pahla- vas and for “exterminating the race of the Ksasharātas” in an inscription  of his descendant Vāsistshsīputra Pulumāvi, indicate that the Ksasharāta  Ksastrapas in western India were defeated by the Sātavāhanas.182 Jain  commentaries referring to a conflict between Nahavāna of Bharukac- cha (Broach) and the Śālavāhana (Sātavāhana) rulers of Paithsāna (the  Sātavāhana capital at Pratistshsāna) lend support to the numismatic and  epigraphic evidence.183 Quasi-historical memories of ongoing conflicts  between the Sakas and Sātavāhanas in western India are also reflected  in the Kālakācāryakathānaka, a medieval Jain hagiographic narrative  which connects the origins of the Azes/Vikrama era of 57/8 BCE and  the Śaka era of 78 CE with the arrival of Sakas in Ujjayinī after they  crossed the Indus and conquered Saurāstsrsa.184 The struggle between  the Sātavāhanas and the Sakas for control of seaports and routes across  the Western Ghats to the Indian hinterland was likely to have been  motivated by the lucrative trade in a variety of commodities that cir- culated in maritime commerce between India and Egypt during this  period.185 A separate branch of Western Ksastrapas apparently called  Kārdamakas succeeded the Ksasharāta Ksastrapas and continued to  rule in Gujarat, Ujjayinī, and parts of western India until 415 CE. The  origins of this family are uncertain, but a reference to a Kardamaga  king who was reborn as a pig as a result of selfishness in Kharostshsī  manuscript fragments suggests links with Sakas in the Northwest.186  181 Casson, Lionel. 1989.

While D.C. Sircar and V.V. Mirashi  maintain that Castsasna was appointed Kusāsnsa viceroy after Nahapāna’s  death “with instructions to recover the lost areas of the satrapy from  the Sātavāhanas” (Sircar 1969: 86), this reconstruction is largely based  on the identity of the Śaka era with a later era initiated by Kanisksa and  the possibility that an image of Castsasna appears in a Kusāsnsa dynas- tic shrine outside of Mathura.188 The expansion of the dominion of  Castsasna and his descendants to Ujjayinī and other areas of western  India does not indicate that they served as Kusāsnsa subordinates, but  instead acted as independent regional rulers who filled a void after the  downfall of the Ksasharātas and a temporary decline of the Sātavāhanas  in the middle of the second century CE.189 analyzes Indian literary references that suggest connections to a Karddama River in  Persia (commentary on Arthaśāstra 2.11) or to a royal lineage of Ksastriyas traced back  to Kārddameya (Rāmāyansa, Uttarakānsdsa, 100.19–20), but Shrava 1947: 68 contends  that Kardamaka refers to the Kardama area near modern Siddhapur in Gujarat. 187 Mirashi 1981, 2.115–9, nos. 45–9, 153–6, no. 63 and Sircar 1965, 173–175, nos.  63–66. Mirashi, Sircar, and Raychaudhuri 1923: 266 deny that the Śaka era of 78 was  initiated by Castsasna, while Fynes claims that Castsasna’s accession date “is almost cer- tainly marked by the commencement of the Śaka era in AD 78” (1995: 44). Falk 2002:  94 suggests that the beginning of the Śaka era may reflect the beginning of Castsasna’s  rule of Ujjayinī on an auspicious date, since the first day of Caitra (April ), 78 CE cor- responds with the conjunction of the sun, moon, and Jupiter in Ares. The longevity of  this era may be linked to its usefulness in casting horoscopes. 188 Falk, Harry. 2001. “The yuga of Sphujiddhvaja and the era of the Kusâsnsas.”  Silk Road Art and Archaeology 7, 121–136; 2002: 91–95, has called attention to the  fact that the Śaka and Kanisksa eras are treated as separate reckoning systems in the  Yavanajātaka. Rosenfield 1967: 145–146 (fig. 3) provisionally labels an image from  the Māt s devakula as “the Caśtasna statue” but acknowledges that Lüders (1961: 145– 147, §100) reads mastana rather than sasstana, which is very difficult to reconcile with  Castsasna’s name in Brāhmī inscriptions and coins of the Western Ksastrapas.

The inscription dated in 150 CE (Śaka year 72) com- memorate repairs to an embankment on Lake Sudarśana at Junagadh,  where the Girnar version of Aśoka’s Major Rock Edicts was inscribed  approximately four centuries earlier.190 The composition of this eulogy  (praśasti) of Rudradāman’s exploits in ornate classical Sanskrit rather  than Prakrit was a significant innovation in Indian cultural history.191  Mahāksastrapa Rudradāman is praised as a skilled and learned over- lord of territories extending from the lower Indus (Sindhu-Sauvīra)  to coastal areas just to the north of modern Mumbai (Aparānta, with  its capital at Sopāra). According to the claims in the inscription, he  twice conquered the Sātavāhana ruler (Sātakarnsi), who is described as  “Master of the Southern Route” (daksisnāpatha-pati). Despite the ago- nistic relationship with the Sātavāhanas, a Sanskrit inscription record- ing a donation of a water cistern in a Buddhist cave at Kanheri (within  the urban area of Mumbai) refers to a marriage alliance between the  Kārdamakas and the Sātavāhanas.192 A Sātavāhana queen who donated  the water cistern was a Kārdamaka descendant and the daughter of  Mahāksastrapa Ru-, probably to be identified with Rudradāman or  another Western Ksastrapa.193 The Kārdamakas consolidated their  190 Kielhorn, Franz. 1905. “Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman; the Year  72.” Epigraphia Indica 8, 36–49; Mirashi 1981: 2. 121–130 (no. 51); Sircar 1965:  175–80 (no. 67).

A later inscription issued during  the time of Skandagupta is discussed later in this chapter under Shifting Networks of  Political Power and Institutional Patronage during the Gupta Period, p. 155. 191 Comments on the Junagadh inscription of Rudradāman by Pollock 2006: 67–73  highlight its significance as a turning point in Sanskrit literary culture, but his con- tention that a “desacralization of Sanskrit” (70) was intitiated by the Sakas “in the  interests of a new cultural politics” (73) seems hyperbolic, since earlier trends towards  Sanskritization are evident in religious donations from Mathura.  192 James Burgess and Bühler, Georg. 1883.

The Kārdamaka lineage of Western Ksastrapas continued to rule  areas of western India from their bases in Ujjayinī and the Kathiawar  peninsula until the end of the fourth century CE.194 In addition to  the marriage between the Kārdamaka princess and the Sātavāhanas  discussed in the previous paragraph, the Western Ksastrapas also estab- lished marital alliances with the Licchavīs of Vaiśālī in the Buddhist  heartland and the Iksvsākus in the Krishna-Godāvarī delta in the east- ern Deccan, where the queens belonging to this dynasty made Buddhist  donations at Nāgārjunakonsdsa.195 This regional dynasty of Kārdamakas  issued inscriptions, coins, and seals (including a monastic sealing of  the “Mahārāja Rudrasena vihāra”)196 until the period of the impe- 194 Mirashi 1981: 1.68–86; Raychaudhuri 1923: 266–270; Sircar, Dineshchandra.  1968. “The Śaka Satraps of Western India.” Chapter 13 in The Age of Imperial Unity.

Saka Summary By establishing themselves as powerful sovereigns at critical nodes in  western and northwestern India, the Sakas of Ujjayinī, Mathura, and  Taxila controlled important routes belonging to overland and maritime  trade networks. Although their role in social, religious, and cultural  transformations in this dynamic period of South Asian history has  not (until recently) received as much attention as earlier Hellenistic  or later Kusāsnsa impacts, various donors connected with Saka courts  directly contributed to the growth of Buddhist religious institutions.  The establishment of relics in stūpas and gifts to Buddhist monas- teries by Mahāksastrapa Patika in Taxila, the Apraca Prince Indra- varman and his wife Uttarā, King Senavarman in Odsi, Queen Ayasia in  Mathura, and the Western Ksastrapas are widely attested in Kharostshsī  and Brāhmī inscriptions. References to Mahāksastrapa Jihonika, Strat- ega Aśpavarman, the Kardamaga King, and other Sakas in Gāndhārī  avadānas acknowledges and reflects their supporting roles in “the great  flowering of Gandhāran Buddhism” (Salomon 1999a: 180). The Sakas,  like the Sātavāhanas and other dynasties with whom they competed,  conformed to the traditional role of Indian rulers as donors to multiple  groups without necessarily adopting an exclusive religious identity.198  Perhaps their adoption of Indian patterns of rulership, appropriation  of South Asian religious symbolism on issues of coins, and use of  Gāndhārī, other regional Prakrit languages, and Sanskrit in inscrip- tions facilitated their gradual acceptance as Ksastriya rulers. However,  a distinctively Saka cultural identity is difficult to recognize in literary  sources that tend to reflect the ideological values and anachronistic  197 Mitchener 1976, 9.827–829; Rosenfield 1967: 133; Sircar 1969: 87–105; Tripathi  1942: 218–219. 198 Fynes 1991; Marshall 1951: 1.57–58. </page> <page sequence="68"> 132 chapter two historical memories of much later periods. Nevertheless, recent dis- coveries of manuscripts and inscriptions support Sten Konow’s char- acterization of the Sakas as “the great intermediators” (1929: xxvi) who  imported Iranian, Hellenistic, and Central Asian elements into South  Asia and exported Indian religious and cultural ideals to Central Asia  with the transmission of Buddhism. Dynamics of Mobility during the Kusāsnsa Period Kusāsnsa control of a network of routes between western Central  Asia and the northern Indian subcontinent accelerated patterns of  cross-cultural exchange, long-distance trade, and religious transmis- sion from the first to third centuries CE. The Kusāsnsas belonged to  a branch of the Yuezhi (as their ancestors are known in Chinese  sources), which had migrated from eastern Central Asia to Bactria  under pressure from other nomadic groups during the second century  BCE.199 The early Kusāsnsas followed similar routes as the Indo-Greeks  and Sakas into the northwestern borderlands of South Asia.200 Kujūla  Kadphises, who established the Kusāsnsa line of emperors, expanded  his domain across the Hindu Kush to Swat, Gandhāra, and Taxila by  the middle of the first century CE, apparently overlapping with con- temporary Gondopharid rulers (discussed previously). By the time  of his grandson Kanisksa (whose second century CE date is discussed  below), the Kusāsnsa realm extended beyond the northwestern urban  centers of Taxila and Mathura to the traditional capitals of the ‘great  countries’ (mahājanapadas) of Kosala, Vatsa, Magadha, and An ֛ga in  northeastern India, according to a Bactrian inscription from Rabatak  in northeastern Afghanistan.201 The list of of these four cities was prob- 199 Annotated translations of primary Chinese historical sources (Han Shu 96A and  Shi ji 123) by Hill 2009, Hulsewé 1979, Thierry 2005, and Zürcher 1968 are referred  to in note 139.

By administering a network from the Oxus basin to the  Ganges delta, the Kusāsnsas effectively unified major nodes of the north- ern routes known as the Uttarāpatha.202 Kusāsnsa administration of this  artery of commercial and cultural exchanges facilitated long-distance  movement of merchants and missionaries between South Asia, Cen- tral Asia, and East Asia. Early Kusāsnsa Genealogy and Chronology Recent scholarly advances have helped to resolve (or at least clarify)  longstanding disputes about early Kusāsnsa history, genealogy and chro- nology. Chinese historical annals indicate that the Yuezhi predeces- sors of the Kusāsnsas originally inhabited the region between the Qilian  and Tien Shan mountains before conflicts with the Xiongnu forced  them to gradually migrate westwards across the Tarim Basin to the Ili  River Basin at the beginning of the Han period from c. 207–162 BCE.203  By c. 128 BCE (after the downfall of Bactrian Greek kingdoms), Yue- zhi migrants were settled north of the Oxus River on the border of  Road Art and Archaeology 4, 75–142.

The Bactrian inscription at a sanctuary (bagolaggo) in Rabatak  (northern Afghanistan) with images of Iranian gods and goddesses  constructed during the first year of the reign of Kanisksa has clarified  the genealogical succession of three generations of Kusāsnsa rulers fol- lowing Kujūla Kadphises.212 In the passage: “for King Kujula Kadphises  (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather,  and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and also for himself, King  Kanishka” (Cribb and Sims-Williams 1995/6: 80), Joe Cribb identifies  Vima Taktu with a Kusāsnsa ruler who issued numerous coins with the  title of ‘Soter Megas’ (“Great Savior”).213 Extensive distribution of this  ruler’s coins reflects an extension of Kusāsna hegemony from northern  210 See Buddhist Patronage by the Apracas and Odsis (pp. 117–120) for a discussion  of the synchronism proposed by Salomon (1999a: 141–149; 2007: 276–277) based on  the marital link between the Apraca princess Vasavadattā and the Odsī courtier Suha- soma attested in Kharostshsī inscriptions (CKI nos. 242, 249, and 369).  211 The chronology of Gondophares based on references in Christian apocryphal lit- erature and a Kharostshsī inscription reportedly from Takht-i Bahi (CKI 53) is detailed  in Indo-Parthians: Mahārāja Gondophares or the Gondopharids?

According to Sims-Williams, Vima Takto’s  name is legible in the opening lines of the Bactrian version of the Dasht-i Nawur  inscriptions, and “Vima Taktu is the only reading which fits the traces of the king’s  name in both the Rabatak and Dasht-i Nawur inscriptions” (2004 [2008]: 65).

Vima Kadphises, who is clearly identi- fied as Kanisksa’s father in the Rabatak inscription but whose name is  not really legible in other epigraphic sources,214 issued the first Kusāsnsa  gold coins and adopted grandiloquent titles such as “King of Kings”  in Greek coin legends, and “Great King, King of Kings, Lord (King)  of All the World, Great Lord (King), Savior” in Kharostshsī.215 The style  of depicting Vima Kadphises in a standing pose making an offering at  a small altar mostly found on his copper coins is adopted in images  on coins of later Kusāsnsa emperors as well as royal statues in shrines  at Surkh Kotal in Afghanistan and Māt sacross the Yamuna River from  Mathura and in petroglyphs from Shatial and Khalatse on the upper  Indus River.216 An absolute date for the beginning of a continuous era initiated by  Kanisksa is disputed, but recent findings have raised significant doubts  about an identification of the Kanisksa era with the Śaka era of 78 CE.217  A formula for calculating the difference between the Śaka and “Kosāsnsa”  eras in the Yavanajātaka (79.15), an astronomical treatise written by  Sphujidhvaja in 269 CE, clearly distinguishes between “the number  of years that have passed of the Kosāsnsas” (kosāsnsagatābdasamskhyā)  and the “the time of the Śakas (i.e., the year in the Śaka era)” (kālahs  śakānāms).218 The formula apparently indicates that 149 years sepa- 214 Konow (1929, 79–81, no.

Fussman 1998: 641 and Senior 2001: 1.130 still favor an initial date for  the Kanisksa era in 78 CE, maintaining the hypothesis that the Western Ksastrapas were  subordinate to the Kusāsnsas and adopted the reckoning system from their overlords. 218 The interpretation of verse 79.15 in the last chapter of the text by Pingree, David.  1978.

Falk’s proposal that one hundred years must be omitted from  the formula seems likely, since there are very strong arguments for the  omission of numerals for hundreds in inscribed sculptures and other  inscriptions with dates in the Kanisksa era.219 Although Sphujidhvaja  and other astrologers were not aware that 127 CE (rather than 227  CE) was the initial date of the historical Kosāsnsa/Kanisksa era, Falk’s  proposed resolution to longstanding debates over a separate Kanisksa  era coheres quite well with current understanding of early Kusāsnsa  dynastic history. However, the solution remains hypothetical until an  inscription dated in both the Śaka and Kanisksa eras confirms Falk’s  interpretation of the formula in the Yavanajātaka. Paradigms of Patronage under Kanisksa and Huvisksa Buddhist literary traditions liken the Kusāsna emperor Kanisksa to a  second Aśoka, but epigraphic and numismatic evidence indicates that  he probably supported multiple religious communities. Evidence for  Kanisksa’s patronage of Buddhist institutions is primarily based on  accounts of Chinese Buddhist visitors as well as Sarvāstivādin and  of the Kusâsnsas in combination with 149 (change into) the time of the Śakas. Subtract- ing from this (Śaka time [plus 56]) the elapsed (yuga, i.e. 165 years) (produces) the  elapsed years of the second yuga” (2001: 127). Depending on Utpala’s commentary on  Brshajjātaka 7.9, Pingree translates: “(If one takes) the number of years of the Kosāsnsas  which have passed and adds 149, then, subtracting from this number the year in the  Śaka era, (one obtains a year in which) another yuga ended” (Falk 2001: 122). Both  Pingree and Falk regard the Śaka and Kosāsnsa (Kusāsnsa) eras as separate reckoning  systems, but Falk proposes that the purpose of the formula is to synchronize the two  reckoning systems in order to calculate the number of years that had elapsed since an  astronomical yuga of 165 years began when the sun and moon enter Ares in conjunc- tion at sunrise on mesassamskrānti (in 22 and 187 CE). 219 Lohuizen De Leeuw, Johanna E.

The Buddha is just one of a wide range of dei- ties, from the pantheons of Iran, the Hellenistic world, Rome, and India,  selected to express the king’s concern for material abundance and pros- perity of his realm, military triumph, legitimacy of his rule, and divine  sanction for his kingship.223 Buddhist narratives with Kanisksa as a prominent figure have been  composed in or translated into Chinese, Tibetan, Central Asian, and  Iranian languages, but he is not mentioned in Pāli literature or in San- skrit purānsas.224 A connection between Kanisksa and the convening of a  220 Kuwayama, Shoshin. 1997.

As concrete evidence does not confirm that Kanisksa was a Buddhist  convert like Aśoka, historians of this period theorize that his suport of  Buddhism was due to a political need to promote his status as a cakra- vartin by making donations to diverse groups in the expanding Kusāsnsa  domain.226 Although he acknowledges that Kusāsnsā rulers and officials  under Kanisksa sponsored a variety of religious institutions (including  Buddhist stūpas), Xavier Tremblay contends that the Kusāsnsas were  Marc Aurel, trans. 1900.

However, as Gérard  Fussman (among others) has pointed out, acceptance of the Buddha’s  teachings (Dharma) did not require lay devotees to give up their own  Hindu, Iranian, indigenous, or other religious beliefs and practices.228  Although he did not necessarily favor Buddhists over other Indian or  Iranian religious groups, under his aegis conditions of material pros- perity fostered an increase in the production of Buddhist art and lit- erature, and it is not accidental that the Senior collection of Kharostshsī  manuscripts was deposited in a stūpa inside a pot inscribed with a date  in the twelfth year of his reign (ca. 140 CE).229 Buddhist inscriptions, manuscripts and archaeological remains  clearly indicate significant growth of monastic institutions and attest  the emergence of the Mahāyāna movement during the long reign of  Huvisksa. Since the dated inscriptions of Kanisksa end in year 23 of his  era (corresponding to ca. 150–151 CE if the era began in 127 CE) and  the dated inscriptions of Huvisksa begin in year 26 (ca. 153–154 CE),  Huvisksa’s immediate succession is somewhat uncertain. The tremen- dous output of gold coins and inscriptions dated between years 26  and 64 (until ca. 191 CE) indicate that Huvisksa ruled for at least 35  years during a prosperous phase of South Asian cultural and economic  history.230 A Mathura Brāhmī inscription from the time of Huvisksa’s  227 Tremblay, Xavier. “The Spread of Buddhism in Serindia-Buddhism among Ira- nians, Tocharians, and Turks before the 13th century.” In Heirman and Bumbacher  2007: 75–129, esp. 82–88. 228 Fussman 1994a: 25, 42. 229 Allon 2007 in Glass 2007a: 3–4; Salomon 2003c: 74–77, figs. 1–2.  230 Rosenfield observes that “The numismatic and epigraphic traces [of Huvisksa’s  rule] are the most copious of any Kushan prince” (1967: 59) and calls the gold coins  issued by Huvisksa a “veritable shower of gold” (1967: 60). His suggestion (based on  the predominance of Iranian deities represented on Huvisksa’s coins) that “the tastes  and interests of the Kushan princes were somewhat at variance with that of their  subjects, as might be expected in a feudal social order imposed by foreign invad- ers” (1967: 73) neglects an “in-built conservatism” (Errington and Cribb 1992: 51) in  numismatic designs, which do not necessarily reflect personal convictions or religious  identities of rulers. </page> <page sequence="77">  historical contexts 141 successor Vāsudeva (dated in year 77, corresponding to ca. 204 CE)  refers to “the monastery of the mahārāja rājātirāja devaputra Hūvīsksa”  (Lüders 1961: 68, § 31). This epigraphic evidence to Huvisksa’s monas- tery at Jamalpur mound in Mathura parallels epigraphic and literary  references to Kanisksa’s monastery in Peshawar. As during the time  of Kanisksa, Kusāsnsa subordinate officials who recorded donations to  numerous religious groups in inscriptions sometimes shared their reli- gious merit with their overlord, Huvisksa. For example, the “principal  lot” (agrabhaga) of merit is assigned to Mahārāja Rājātirāja Huvisksa  in a reliquary vase inscription from Wardak in central Afghanistan  dated in year 51 (ca. 178 CE).231 Nascent Indian Mahāyāna traditions  are attested in a Mathura Brāhmī inscription on the pedestal of “an  image of the Blessed One, the Buddha Amitābha” (Schopen 1987b:  111) dated at or near the beginning of Huvisksa’s reign (year 26).232  Huvisksa was portrayed as a Mahāyāna follower “who has set forth on  the (Great) Vehicle” (Salomon 2002b: 256) in a version of an avadāna  narrative preserved in fourth century Buddhist Sanskrit manuscript  fragments in the Schøyen collection.233 A literary parallel to a similar  story set in Huvisksa’s court is preserved in the Chinese translation  of the Kalpanāmansdsitikā or Sutrālan֛kāra (Dazhuanyan lun jing).234  However, Prasenajit of Kosala rather than Huvisksa is the king in a  shorter version in the *Samsyuktaratnapitaskasūtra or *Ksusdrakapitaska  (Za bao zang jing).235 The Mathura inscription and the narrative with  231 CKI 159 (http://www.ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0159); Errington  and Cribb 1992: 174–175; Konow 1929: 165–170.

Vicissitudes of the Later Kusāsnsas Following the period of Huvisksa, the dynastic fortunes of the Kusāsnsas  gradually declined during the reign of Vāsudeva and his successors in  the third century CE. Brāhmī inscriptions dated in Kanisksa era years  from 64 or 67 (ca. 191–194 CE) to 98 (ca. 225–6 CE) demonstrate  that Vāsudeva ruled for at least thirty years. His apparently Vaisnssava  proper name and his coins with images of Śiva (Ooesho) standing  in front of Nandin (his bull vāhana) reflect a trend towards greater  Indianization.236 The territory controlled by Vāsudeva may have been  reduced to regions of North India and parts of the Punjab, since he  is not mentioned in inscriptions from the Northwest, and the burial  of his coins around Taxila suggests a crisis.237 According to Rosen- field (1967: 104–105), at least two other Kusāsnsa rulers were named  Vāsudeva, but it is not necessary to add more Vāsudevas to the Kusāsnsa  genealogy if the Kanisksa era begins in 127 CE rather than 78 CE.  A later Kusāsnsa ruler named Kanisksa (II) who copied Vāsudeva’s coin  types appears to have directly succeeded Vāsudeva after the first cen- tury of the Kanisksa era (ca. 227 CE). Brāhmī inscriptions from Mathura and Sāñcī dated in years 24 and  28 during the reign of an otherwise unknown Kusāsnsa ruler named  Vāsisksa probably belong to the second century of the Kanisksa era  (with corresponding dates in 251–2 and 255–6 CE).238 A Kharostshsī  236 Rosenfield 1967: 104; Sircar, Dineschandra. 1971c. “Vāsudeva-Krssnssa and  Nārāyansa in Early Vaisnssavism.” In Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval  India. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 16–38, states that Vāsudeva’s name “. . . indicates the  Bhāgavata leanings of the later Kusāsnsas who had an important gubernatorial centre at  Mathurā” (22). However, the Śiva and Bull motif on his coins (which appeared earlier  on the coins of Wima Kadphises) indicates that Vāsudeva’s religious identity was not  exclusively Vaisnssava. 237 Rosenfield 1967: 105. 238 A Brāhmī inscription on an inscribed pillar ( yūpa) from Iśapur near Mathura  is dated in the 24th year “of the reign of mahārāja rājātirāja devaputra sāshi Vāsisksa”  (Lüders 1961: 125–6 [§94]), and another Brāhmī inscription on a fragment of a seated  Buddha probably from Jamalpur mound in Mathura is dated in year 28, but the reading  of Vāsisksa’s name is uncertain (Lüders 1961: 63 [§28]). A Brāhmī inscription on the  </page> <page sequence="79">  historical contexts 143 inscription found at Ārā near Attock on the Indus River in north- west Pakistan refers to a son of Vāsisksa (Vazesksa) named Kanisksa (III)  ruling with full imperial titles in year 41 (ca. 268 CE), which seems  to indicate that the Kusāsnsas were still acknowledged as powerful rul- ers in this region.239 While scholars have suggested that Vāsisksa and  a nephew named Kanisksa vied with Huvisksa, it seems more likely  that the numerals for hundreds have been omitted from the Kanisksa  era dates in inscriptions of Vāsisksa and his son named Kanisksa (III),  whose reigns fall in middle to end of the third century CE.240 Thus,  they probably came into conflict with Shapur I, the Sasanian ruler of  Iran from 241–271 CE, who claimed to have conquered part of the  Kusāsnsa realm possibly as far as Peshawar by ca. 260 CE.241 Kusha- no-Sasanian rulers continued to produce Kusāsnsa-type coins until the  fourth century period of the Sasanian ruler Shapur II (309–379 CE).  The political history of the former territories of the Kusāsnsas in the  northwestern borderlands from the late third to early fourth century  CE is almost as opaque as the end of Kusāsnsa rule in Mathura and the  Ganga-Yamuna doāb, which is likewise “lost in the general obscurity  which hovers over North Indian history in the later third century”  (Rosenfield 1967: 115). base of a Bodhisattva image donated to a shrine at Sāñcī commemorating Siddhārtha’s  first meditation under the Jambu-tree is is also dated in the 28th year of (*mahārāja)  rājātirāja (*deva)putra sāshi Vās(*i)sksa (Lüders 1912: no. 161; Majumdar 1940: 1.385;  Sircar 1965: 150, no. 48; Willis, Michael. 1999/2000. “The Sānchī Bodhisattva dated  Kusāsnsa year 28.” Silk Road Art and Archaeology 6, 269–273).

A chain of cit- ies from Termez in the Oxus valley to Begram in the Hindu Kush,  Peshawar in Gandhāra, Taxila in the Potwar plateau of the Punjab,  and Mathura on the Yamuna River linked the multicultural empire  of the Kusāsnsas to the Northern Route (uttarāpatha). Although the  Kusāsnsas did not directly administer western Indian ports ruled by the  Western Ksastrapas or the so-called silk routes in the Tarim Basin, it is  likely that alliances with regional rulers allowed the Kusāsnsas to act as  intermediaries between trans-Asian overland and maritime networks.242  Kusāsnsa power was linked to long-distance trade in luxury items such  as silk from China, jade from Khotan, lapis lazuli from northeastern  Afghanistan, and other precious commodities which appear in lists  of the “seven jewels” (saptaratna) in Buddhist texts.243 The stability of  overland commercial routes controlled by the Kusāsnsas helped to gen- erate material surpluses used to support religious institutions, which  received ample donations recorded in Kharostshsī, Brāhmī, and Bac- trian inscriptions. Kusāsnsa emperors such as Kanisksa and Huvisksa are  credited with the construction of stūpas and monasteries in Peshawar  and Mathura and appear in narratives as exemplary rulers comparable  to Aśoka and Prasenajit, but their direct role in the growth of Buddhist  monasticism was probably less significant than local officials and lay  donors whose offerings of relics, images, and other meritorious gifts  helped to establish and maintain residential communities of monks  and nuns.

Shifting Networks of Political Power and Institutional Patronage  during the Gupta Period Following the Kusāsnsa period, Buddhist institutions successfully  adapted to economic and political transitions, despite commonplace  assertions that “Buddhism in Gupta India was losing out to Brahman- ism” (Liu 1988: 128). A brief interlude of perhaps less than 50 years,  sometimes referred to as a “Dark Interval” (Tripathi 1942: 234–236),  between the post-Kusāsnsa phase in the late third century and the begin- ning of the Gupta period in 319 CE was marked by the ascendance  of various regional powers, such as the Western Ksastrapas, Iksvsākus,  and Vākātaskas.244 Epigraphic records of permanent endowments  (aksasyanīvī), gifts of landed property, and interest-earning donations  that enabled monasteries to reduce thier dependence on individual  donations attest to the persisting strength and accelerating growth of  Buddhist institutions.245 Buddhist art and architecture at Bodh Gaya,  244 The cultural impact and patronage patterns of the Western Ksastrapas and  Iksvsākus are discussed earlier in this chapter (Ksasharāta and Kārdamaka Ksastrapas  in Western India, note 195 for the Iksvsākus), and the Vākātaska patterns of institu- tional support are treated in the following subchapter (Vākātaska Networks of Religious  Patronage).  245 Schopen 1994c (“Doing Business for the Lord”): 533–534 (= 2004: 52–53) points  out that aksasyanīvī grants dating from as early as the 1st–2nd centuries CE before  the Gupta period in Andhra, Kānheri, and Mathura were widespread instruments for  </page> <page sequence="82"> 146 chapter two flourishing Buddhist and Jain ateliers at Mathura, and numerous high  quality Buddhist sculptures with Gupta period inscriptions from Sar- nath reflect an acceleration rather than slackening of artistic produc- tion at Buddhist shrines in north India.246 Although it is beyond the  scope of the overview in this chapter to address internal developments  within Buddhist traditions, Gregory Schopen has persuasively demon- strated that epigraphic formulae referring to monks as Śākyabhiksuss,  textual production of Mahāyāna sūtras, and doctrinal elaborations  associated with prominent figures mark the institutionalization of  Mahāyāna during the Gupta period.247 Historians such as Ramashan- kar Tripathi argue that the “catholicity of the age” (1942: 274) and  the “beneficient rule of Gupta emperors who were men of catholic  culture” (277) was responsible for the vitality of Buddhist literary  and visual culture. While some Gupta subordinates acted as Buddhist  donors, the Guptas themselves generally drew on Vaisnssava imagery  and language to portray themselves as “supreme devotees” (parama- bhāgavatas), perhaps in a conscious effort to legitimate themselves  as supreme rulers.248 The impact of this official propaganda appears  to have been limited to dynastic temples, such as those at Udayagiri,  and does not seem to have adversely affected Buddhist communities,  since Buddhist monuments located within walking distance at Sāñcī  continued to prosper. Therefore, the pattern is one of increased Bud- dhist artistic and literary output, which was probably stimulated by a  competitive religious atmosphere. supporting a variety of religious institutions.

Following her husband’s death in 405 CE, Prabhāvatī  Guptā reigned as a powerful dowager queen and continued to exercise  significant influence over her sons Dāmodarasena (reigning ca. 415– 422) and Pravaresena II (422–457), who shifted his royal residence to  Pravarapura (modern Mansar) and constructed an impressive temple  to Śiva named Pravareśvara.253 In apparent contrast to the Eastern Vākātaskas, who depicted them- selves as devotees of Visnssu and Śiva in their inscriptions and estab- lished a network of Hindu temples and shrines around Rāmagiri, the  Western Vākātaskas are directly linked with elaborate Buddhist cave  complexes at Ajanstās and Ghatostkaca during the reign of Harisesnsa at  the end of the fifth century (ca. 460–478).254 While some caves at Ajanstās  were excavated as early as the first or second centuries BCE (nos. 9, 10,  12), praśasti inscriptions indicate that Harisesnsa’s minister Varāhadeva  was the donor of the Ghatostkaca cave and Ajanstās cave 16, while a  local ruler who was subservient to Harisesnsa donated Ajanstās caves 17  and 19.255 Buddhist paintings and architecture in the Ajanstās caves not  only serve as valuable art historical evidence, but also reflect the cir- other in different periods, Kulke, Hermann. 2004. “Some Thoughts on State and State  Formation under the Eastern Vākātaskas.” In Bakker 2004: 1–9 comments on Vākātaska  historiography and argues that “The inscriptions of both so-called branches of the  Vākātaskas thus neither contain any hint at a united dynasty nor at the quest for some  kind of superiority by one of the two branches” (2004:3).  253 Prabhāvatī Guptā’s role as a patroness of royal Vaisnssava ideology and symbol- ism is emphasized by Bakker, Hans. 1992. “Memorials, Temples, Gods, and Kings:  An attempt to unravel the symbolic texture of Vākātaska kingship.” In Ritual, State  and History in South Asia: Essays in Honour of J.C.

Bakker 1997: 41 points out that the Buddhist caves were not dedicated  by Harisesnsa himself, and probably continued to be excavated after the Aśmakas had  gained control of the area from the Western Vākātaskas.  255 Mirashi 1963: 103–129 (nos. 25–27).

Gupta ‘Golden Age’ Reappraised A persistent historiographical dichotomy between the ‘Golden Age’  of imperial Gupta rulers who are portrayed as quasi-nationalist sup- porters of “vigorous Brahmanic revival and restoration” (Bhandarkar  1920: 51) and a decline of Buddhist institutions with the withdrawal of  Story and Homology.” In Bakker 2004: 109–132 and Cohen, Richard. 2006. “Ajanta’s  Inscriptions.” Appendix to Spink 2005: vol. 2, 273–339. 256 Relationships between textual sources and Buddhist narratives depicted in  Ajanstās paintings have been masterfully treated by Dieter Schlingloff and Monika Zin  in numerous articles collected (in English translation) in Schlingloff 1987.

According to Bakker 2004: v, one main north-south  itinerary from Prayāga (Allahabad) at the Ganga-Yamuna confluence to Pratistshsāna  (Paithan) on the upper Godavari River passed through the Western Vākātaska king- dom, while another north-south route from Kauśāmbī to the lower Krishna-Godavari  delta (formerly the domain of the Iksvsākus) passed through the capital of the East- ern Vākātaskas. East-west routes through the territories of the Eastern and Western  Vākātaskas from Daksisnsa Kośala (modern Chattisgarh) to western coastal ports at  Sopara and Kalyan bisected the north-south arteries.  258 Routes and nodes of this network are investigated in more detail in the subchap- ter on the Southern Route (Daksisnsāpatha) in Chapter 3 (pp. 205–217). </page> <page sequence="86"> 150 chapter two foreign support does not withstand scrutiny.259 Claims that “Brahmani- cal Hinduism became dominant all over India, and other religious sys- tems were more or less neglected” (Chatterjee 2005: 199) are typically  followed by retractions (“. . . but Buddhism retained its hold in many  centres”), since Buddhist material and cultural contributions as well  as internal developments during this period are difficult to overlook.260  Michael Willis traces the modern construction of a Gupta ‘Golden  Age’ to Vincent Smith, for whom “. . . the reign of a great monarch  in a golden age would have to have been long, happy and glorious”  (2005: 142–143).261 Romila Thapar has questioned “. . . the notion of a  uniformly Golden Age that encompasses an entire society” (2003: 280)  and argues that “the Gupta period is the threshold to a marked muta- tion of north Indian society during the late-first millennium AD rather  than a revival or renaissance” (2003: 282).262 The Guptas appropriated  precedents set by earlier Indian rulers by revising and reinventing the  past, so that their dynastic names, titles, inscriptions, and dating sys- tems can seem like “a historical palimpsest” (Thapar 2003: 283). 259 Bhandarkar, Ramkrishna Gopal. 1920 [1897].

The Guptas emu- lated the Kusāsnsas by giving the imperial title of Mahārājādhirāja to  Candragupta and successive Gupta rulers and by striking coins based  on Kusāsnsa models.264 The Guptas continued to use the Kanisksa era  (with hundreds omitted) in inscriptions dated “in the continuous  year” (kālānuvartamāna-samsvatsare) along with a “victorious royal  year” (vijayarājya-samsvatsare) of the Gupta era beginning in 319 CE.265  Since the Gupta era was not used until the time of Candragupta II,  who began ruling sometime before 388 CE, Candragupta I and his  successor Samudragupta are somewhat arbitrarily assigned reigns of  20 to 25 years.266 263 Bhandarkar et al. 1981 suggests that since Kumāradevī was apparently the  Licchavī ruler’s only child, “she naturally succeeded him to his kingdom and admin- istered it along with her husband” (1981: 6). A link with the Licchavīs is clear from  the Allahabad pillar inscription, which indicates that Samudragupta was the ‘daugh- ter’s son of the Licchavi, born from mahādevī Kumāradevī’ (l. 29: licchavi-dauhitrasya  mahādevyāms Kumāradevyām=utphannasya).  264 Candragupta is titled Mahārājādhirāja in Samudragupta’s Allahabad pillar  inscription (Fleet 1888: 16), but in the Gupta genealogy of Prabhāvatī Guptā’s Poona  and Rʕddhapur copper-plate inscriptions (Mirashi 1963: 7–8 (no. 2), 36–37 (No. 8))  Candragupta has the same title of Mahārāja as Ghatostkaca, the “first king of the  Guptas” (Guptādirāja/ Guptānam=ādirājo).

Schmiedchen and Virkus  point out that the initial use of the newly created Gupta era in Mathura during the  reign of Candragupta II was an aspect of self-representation that helped to intensify  their imperial image in an impotant metropolitan area formerly dominated by the  Kusāsnsas and Śakas (2002: 111). 266 Following Falk 2004: 169–172, the date of the Mathura pillar inscription of year  61 “in the continuous year” is calculated from 327 CE rather than 319 CE.  </page> <page sequence="88"> 152 chapter two The commemoration of Samudragupta’s exploits in a classical San- skrit inscription written on an Aśokan pillar at the confluence of the  Ganga and Yamuna rivers marks an important juncture in South Asian  political and cultural history.267 Thapar remarks that “It is curious that  he should have chosen this pillar, carrying the pillar edicts of Ashoka,  suggesting either that he was claiming some historical continuity or, if  the earlier inscriptions could stil be read, that he was taking a contrary  stand to the views of Ashoka” (2003: 283). Although the first four lines  (two verses) of the inscription are damaged, the genealogy of early  Gupta rulers near the end of the inscription specifies that Mahārājas  (Śrī)Gupta and Ghatostkaca and Mahārājādhirāja Candragupta pre- ceded Samudragupta. The epigraphic eulogy (praśasti) in praise of  Samudragupta’s military expeditions and personal qualities was com- posed by a court poet named Harisesnsa.268 This ornate composition of  mixed prose and verse is regarded as an impressive example of the  campū style of Sanskrit poetry (kāvya) and represents a significant  transition from Prakrit to Sanskrit in royal inscriptions, since “From  this point on, all the inscriptions of the Guptas and their neighbors an  feudatories in northern India were written in correct classical Sanskrit”  (Salomon 1998a: 92).269 Daud Ali (2004: 83) argues that ubiquitous  references to ‘fame’ (kīrti, yaśas) in this inscription of Samudragupta  and thousands of other praśastis show that building a reputation was  probably an important motivating factor. Caution is necessary in interpreting the claims of conquest attrib- uted to Samudragupta, however, since the “the conventional bombast  and rhetorical exaggeration of the praśasti style” (Salomon 1998a: 229)  was not intended to serve as an objective account of historically veri- fiable events. Thus, Harisesnsa’s claims that Samudragupta increased  his glory by “capturing and then liberating” twelve southern kings of  Daksisnsāpatha and “violently exterminating” eight kings of Āryāvarta  in a ‘conquest of the directions’ (digvijaya) can not be accepted at  face value, since his military expeditions were probably limited to  267 Fleet 1888: 1–17 (no. 1); Sircar 1965: 262–268 (no. 2). 268 Ali 2004: 46 comments that Harisesnsa was awarded the titles of ‘officer for peace  and war’ (sandhivigrahika), ‘princely counselor’ (kumārāmātya), and ‘great leader of  the forces’ (mahādansdsanāyaka) for assuming various service functions in the royal  household, and was probably treated on a level similar to military retainers and vassals  (2004: 46). Richard Salomon remarks that “. . . the composition of such panegyrics was  perhaps more a labor of daily bread than of love” (1998a: 236).  269 See also Salomon 1998: 110–113 for further discussion of epigraphic praśastis. </page> <page sequence="89">  historical contexts 153 regions directly to the south and east of the Narmada River valley not  controlled by the Vākātaskas and to territories adjacent to the Ganga- Yamuna doāb.270 References to Kusāsnsa successors in the Northwest as  Daivaputra-Sāshi-Sāshānu-Sāshis and to the Western Ksastrapas (prob- ably) as Śaka-Murunsdsas together with the Simhalas “and all the other  island-dwellers” (sarvva-dvīpa-vāsibhir-) more likely reflects a vague  awareness of distant rulers and peoples than submission to Sam- udragupta. Samudragupta issued a series of gold coins with the emblem  of Garudsa (the mount, or vāhana, of Visnssu) and another series of  coins and seals commemorating the performance of a horse sacrifice  (aśvamedha).271 Later Gupta inscriptions of Kumāragupta issued in  year 96 (415/6 CE) and of Skandagupta (reigning ca. 456–467) refer  to Samudragupta as “the restorer of the Aśvamedha sacrifice that had  long been in abeyance” (Fleet 1888: 44, 51).272 While numismatic and  epigraphic evidence reflects the religious proclivities of Samudragupta  and the Gupta dynasty, R.C. Majumdar’s statement that “there can be  hardly any doubt that his reign marked a distinct revival of the old  glory and influence of the Brahmanical religion which had suffered  decline since Aśoka made Buddhism the dominant religion of India”  (1954: 15) pushes this evidence too far, since his impact on religious  beliefs and practices beyond the royal court was relatively limited. After Samudragupta’s reign, there was a succession dispute  between Rāmagupta and Candragupta II, who eventually consoli- dated Gupta dominion.

Following La Vallée Poussin 1935: 45, it is necessary to read between the lines  of fantastic formulae which “give an aspect of vassality to their diplomatic relations,”  since the foreign countries were completely independent. 271 Raven 1994 thoroughly examines Gupta gold goins with the “Garudsa-Banner”  issued by rulers form the Samudragupta to Skandagupta and discusses epigraphic ref- erences and images on royal seals and Gupta period art, concluding that “. . . the valiant  king of birds, Garudsa Vainateya, is the perfect representative of Gupta kingship, might  and glory” (1994: 196), and symbolizes a bond between Gupta kings and Vāsudeva/ Visnssu. Lindquist, Steven. 2003. “Enigmatic Numismatics: Kings, Horses, and the  Aśvamedha Coin-type.” South Asian Studies 19, 105–112 argues that the images of  the horse and Śrī on the Aśvamedha coins of Kumāragupta I and Samudragupta ful- fill narrative and representational purposes, since the king can be identified with the  horse and the queen with Śrī. 272 Bhandarkar, Chhabra and Gai 1981:35–42, Sircar 1965: 275. </page> <page sequence="90"> 154 chapter two (probably identical to Rāmagupta) lend credence to Sanskrit and Ara- bic literary references to a struggle between Rāmagupta (Rawwāl in  Arabic) and Candragupta (Barkamāris) in which Candragupta killed  Rāmagupta and took his wife Dhruvadevī after Rāmagupta was defeated  by the Śakas (Western Ksastrapas).273 As Michael Willis remarks, rivalry  for the Gupta throne was fiercely contested: Each king was forced to engage in a vigorous struggle for political, mili- tary and ritual supremacy. The system was sufficiently precarious and  predatory that the king’s attempt to create a working circle of power  could come unraveled at any moment (2005: 144). Rāmagupta’s “circle of power” appears to have been restricted to the  Mālava region around Vidiśā and it is uncertain that he ruled for very  long (ca. 375–380 is a very rough estimate). Candragupta II succeeded in expanding the Gupta domain during  a long reign of over thirty years (ca. 380–415). His own marriage with  Kuberanāgā, a Bhāraśiva Nāga princess, and the marriage between  their daughter Prabhāvatī Guptā and the Eastern Vākātaska ruler  Rudrasena II cemented alliances with important allies in northern and  central India.274 His conquest of the Western Ksastrapas in Ujjayinī and  Gujarat at the beginning of the fifth century (ca. 409/10 CE) was a  signal event, since the Guptas now controlled important links between  overland networks and ports in western India.275 Legends associating  Vikramāditya (an epithet of Candragupta II) with the establishment  of the Azes (so-called “Vikrama”) era of 58 BCE anachronistically  recall his campaigns against the Western Ksastrapas.276 By building  monuments for worshipping Visnssu in the form of Nārāyansa, Varāha  273 Bhandarkar et al. 1981: 46–52 provide a detailed account of the inscriptions,  coins, and versions in literary sources, including Viśākhadatta’s Devīcandraguptam  (lost but fragments preserved in Nātysadarpansa), Bānsa’s Harsascarita, Bhoja’s  Śrsn֛gāraprakāśa, Rājaśekhara’s Kāvyamimāmssā, and the Majmālut-Tawārikh.

Kumāragupta I, a son of Candragupta  II and Dhruvadevī, ruled for at least thirty years from ca. 415–447.279  Inscriptions issued during his reign are mostly Brahmanical dona- tions, although a few Jain and Buddhist inscriptions are attested.280  After Kumāragupta, there was another succession dispute between his  brother Ghatostkacagupta and his bastard son, Skandagupta.281 At Jun- agadh, on the same rock inscribed with the Girnar version of Aśoka’s  major rock edicts and Rudradāman’s praśasti inscription of 150 CE,  an elaborate Sanskrit inscription records the construction of a temple  to Visnssu and repairs to the dam on Sudarśana lake between 455–458  CE by a local subordinate of Skandagupta named Cakrapālita, whose  father Parnsadatta had been appointed governor of Saurāstsrsa.282 Another  private donor of five Jain images at the village of Kakubha (modern  Kahāum in Gorakhpur district in northeastern Uttar Pradesh) in 460  CE effusively praised Skandagupta: Lord over a hundred kings, who is like Śakra (Indra), whose audience  hall is fanned by the breeze from the bowing of the heads of hundreds of  kings, who was born in the lineage of the Guptas, whose glory has spread  afar, and who prospers above all others.283 277 Williams 1982: 40–55; Willis 2009. 278 Fleet 1888: 29–34 (no. 5); Williams 1982: 37. 279 Dates for Kumāragupta I are fixed by the Bilsad pillar inscription of Gupta year  96 (415–416 CE) and the Dāmodarpur copper-plates of Gupta year 128 (447 CE)  (Willis 2005: 136). 280 Fleet 1888: 39–47 (nos. 8–11); Sircar 1965: 285–295; Bhandarkar et al. 1981:  77–78 refer to Buddhist and Jain donations. 281 Bakker 1997: 25–29; Bakker 2006: 178–179; Willis 2005: 136.

The Guptas relied on  a network of allies to establish and maintain control of critical regions,  but their former regional subordinates asserted themselves and groups  of outsiders, particularly the Hūnsas, filled the void as Gupta power  declined.     288289290 Table 2.4: Vākātaska-Gupta Genealogy and Chronology288 Eastern Vākātaskas Western Vākātaskas Guptas Vindhyaśakti (c. 250) Ghatostkaca (c. 300–319) Pravarasena I (c. 275–335) Candragupta I Gautamīputra290 (c. 319–350)289 Rudrasena I Sarvasena I (c. 330–355) Samudragupta  (c. 335–360) (c. 350–375) 284 Fleet 1988: 52–56, no. 13; Sircar 1965: 321–324.

Ronald Davidson links  the “early medieval vitality” of Indian religions, literature, and art  to “the valorization of regional identity” and a “discourse of divine  power” whereby “the gods became kings even as the kings became  gods” (2003: 74).296 The systematic use of imperial metaphors of divine  apotheosis in public inscriptions and literary texts composed in the  courts of rulers who aspired to fulfill the cakravartin ideal of universal  overlordship provides a political-historical context for the develop- ment of a “mature synthesis of esoteric Buddhism” (Davidson 2002:  114) and the monastic institutionalization of Śaiva Tantrism, both  of which provided rival rituals of consecration (abhiseska), powerful  texts and formulas (mantras), and religious ideologies to confer royal  legitimacy.297 Volatile political alliances, changing military alignments,  and fluctuating migration patterns did not result in insular stagna- tion, but often caused shifts in transregional routes for commercial  exchanges and religious transmission. Contemporary sources from  this period, including the accounts of Chinese travelers, inscriptions  of visitors to Indian Buddhist centers, and material artifacts found far  way from their original contexts, attest significant mobility via over- land and maritime itineraries. The emergence of new trade networks  and merchant communities (such as the Sogdians in Central Asia)  and macroregional conflicts between Indian, Chinese, Central Asian,  Tibetan, and Arab forces had major impacts on cultural transmission,  sometimes prompting the creation of new ties and in other cases con- straining access. The re-emergence of the northwestern borderlands as  a contact zone between South Asia and Central Asia deserves special  emphasis, since Buddhist literary and material cultures flourished at  nodes for long-distance trade and political administration loosely con- 296 Davidson, Ronald M. 2002.

Kidāras and Huns in the Northwestern Indian Subcontinent Like their Saka and Kusāsnsa predecessors, the Kidāra and Alchon Huns  migrated to the Indo-Iranian borderlands from Central Asia as a result  of Xiongnu nomadic expansion. Although relationships between Hun- nic groups known as the Hūnsas in Indian sources (and Chionites  or Hephthalites in western sources) remain unclear due to conflict- ing reports about their origins and identities, they filled a significant  gap by asserting control of areas between the eastern frontier of the  Sasanians and the northwestern borderlands of the Guptas and their  allies beginning in the fifth century CE.298 Based primarily on analy- sis of coins and seals, a group identified as the Kidāras emerged as  autonomous rulers of large areas between Gandhāra and western Cen- tral Asia in the fifth century (ca. 430–477).299 Chinese sources based  on the report of Dong Wan’s mission to the Western Regions in 437  CE affiliate the Kidāras (Juduoluo) with the Yuezhi (rather than the  Xiongnu), but the testimony attributed to him may have been copied  from or harmonized with later historical texts.300 The Kidāras por- tray themselves as “restorers of the previous order” (Grenet 2002:  298 La Vaissière, Étienne de. 2003 (2007). “Is There a ‘Nationality of the Hephtalites’?”  Bulletin of the Asia Institute 17, 119–132. 299 Grenet, Frantz. 2002. “Regional Interaction in Central Asia and Northwest India  in the Kidarite and Hephthalite periods.” Proceedings of the British Academy 116, 203– 224. Grenet’s dates are adopted, although the chronological range for the Kidāras is  highly uncertain, since the Chionites with whom they are sometimes identified are  assigned to a period beginning in the fourth century immediately after the Sasanians  lost control of Bactria in the mid-370’s during the rule of Shapur II (Grenet 2002:  206). La Vaissière’s hypothesis that “. . . all the nomadic kingdoms that flourished in  Bactria between the middle of the fourth century and the middle of the sixth century  can trace their origin back to a single episode of massive migration in the second half  of the fourth century (circa 350–370), and not to a whole set of successive migra- tions” (2003 [2007]: 122) alleviates problematic associations between the Chionites  and Kidāras, while leaving a significant lag before the Kidāras emerged as regional  political power. 300 Passages referring to the Yuezhi affiliation of the Kidāras and Hephtalites in Wei  shu (“History of the Wei”) chapter 102,8b (p. 2278), Bei shi (“History of the Northern  Dynasties”) chapter 97.11b (pp. 3230–31), Zhoushou chapter 50 (p. 918), and Suishu  chapter 83 (p. 1854) indicate that in the sixth century when the textual passages were  redacted, the origins of the groups which occupied the former territory of the Kusāsnsas  were no longer clearly understood (La Vaissière 2003 [2007]: 120).  </page> <page sequence="96"> 160 chapter two 206–7) of the Kusāsnsas or Kushano-Sassanians by adopting the title  of Kidāra kusāsna sāshi on Brāhmī coin legends. However, the title of  Kidāra kusāsna sāshi does not necessarily indicate that the Kidāras were  related to the Kusāsnsas, but ruled the former Kusāsnsa territory.301 Keep- ing these caveats in mind, Shōshin Kuwayama reconstructs a scenario  in which the Kidāras migrated to northwestern Pakistan after gaining  control of five kingdoms north of Gandhāra and established a capital  at Purusaspura (moden Peshawar) based on passages in the Weishu: The king of Da Yuezhi called Jiduoluo (Kidara), brave and fierce, even- tually dispatched his troops southward and invaded North India (pres- ent-day Pakistan), crossing the great mountains to subjugate the five  kingdoms which were located to the north of Gandhāra.302 Brief Chinese references to Kidāra rulers coupled with distribution  of their coin-types on both sides of the Hindu Kush from northern  Gandhāra, Swat and Bannu (in present-day Northwest Pakistan) to  Samarkand in ancient Sogdia have resulted in different interpretations  of their relationships with regional contemporaries. Since Kidāra coins  fit into a continuous series with those issued by their Kushano-Sasa- nian predecessors, Robert Göbl (1967) views the Kidāras as erstwhile  regional allies of the Sasanians against the Alchon Huns. Adopting  the perspective of the Chinese accounts, Kuwayama (1989, 1992)  also holds that the Kidāras were opponents of a subsequent ‘wave’ of  Xiongnu invaders who drove them out of Bactria (which Kuwayama  refers to as Tokharistan) and into the northwestern frontiers of South  Asia. Frantz Grenet (2002) questions the loyalty of the Kidāras to the  Sasanians, since they “cashed in on the military threat they exercised  against Iran” (2002: 209) by exacting tribute from Sasanian rulers  such as Yazdigird II.

According to Kuwayama, the five  kingdoms to the north of Gandhāra included Yarkand, Tashkurgan, Wakhan, Chitral,  and possibly Swat, although Grenet (2002: 207, n. 6) suggests that Kapisa should be  added to the list.

Grenet surmises that the Kidāras (and  the Alchon Huns who later supplanted them) “. . . sought to control the  mountainous nexus of trade routes linking Bactria, India, China, and  Sogdiana” (2002: 207). The expansion of the Kidāra and Hephthalite  Huns to Sogdia entailed a process of “Bactrianisation” (Grenet 2002:  208) whereby Indian cultural elements (including Buddhist elements)  were introduced to some areas of western Central Asia which had not  been exposed to the initial phases of long-distance transmission in ear- lier periods. By acting as political and cultural mediators between India, Iran,  and Central Asia, the Alchon Huns (identifiable with the Indian  Hūnsas, Chinese Yida or Yada, and Hephthalites in Western historical  sources) aided the development of overland trade and expansion of  Buddhist networks in the fifth and sixth centuries, despite their exag- gerated reputation as oppressive barbarians in Chinese and Sanskrit  literary sources. While the Alchon Huns had much in common with  the Kidāras (including similar origins in mass migrations from Central  Asia to Bactria in the fourth century), they consciously distinguished  themselves by abandoning Kusāsnsa titles, using Bactrian and Brāhmī  instead of Pahlavi on coin and seal legends, and developing distinctive  styles of ornamentation and portraiture (particularly their artificially  deformed craniums or “steeple heads”).303 They played a prominent  role in Central Asian geopolitics in the fifth and sixth centuries by  engaging in conflicts and enacting alliances with a series of Sasanian  rulers (helping Peroz rise to power between 459–484 and sheltering  Kawad I between 484–488), and expanding their dominion west to  the Merv oasis (probably during the reign of Kavad I) and north to  303 Alram, Michael. 2003 (2007). “Three Hunnic Bullae from Northwest India.”  Bulletin of the Asia Institute 17, 179; Göbl 1967: 2.232 ff.; Grenet 2002: 210; Callieri,  Pierfrancisco. 1997.

The recent publication of a  Sanskrit inscription on a thin copper scroll belonging to the Schøyen  collection provides valuable information about the identities of Alchon  Huns who are named in a list of secondary donors who received credit  for the erection of a relic stūpa.306 If Gudrun Melzer’s identification of  year 68 as a Laukika era date corresponding to 492/3 CE is correct,  this inscription supplies a fixed point in the chronology of the Alchon  304 Bivar, ADH. 2004. “Hephthalites.” In Encyclopedia Iranica Online, available at  http://www.iranica.com/newsite/; Grenet 2002: 212–213, 220–221; Kuwayama 1992:  3 (part 2); La Vaissière, Étienne de. 2005 [2002].

Melzer (2006: 252) suggests that these cita- tion may indicate the use of Pratītyasamutpāda texts in consecration  rituals. The invocation of passages from Mahāyāna sūtras and the con- cluding seven verses composed in classical Sanskrit meters show that  monasteries supported by the Alchon Huns in a region “adorned with  stūpas resembling a multitude of autumn clouds” (Melzer 2006: 277)  were linked to Buddhist scholastic and literary networks. The Alchon Hun rulers Toramānsa and Javūkha are also associated  with the donation of a monastery in another Buddhist inscription  from Kura in the Salt Range in the western Punjab.310 The primary  307 Melzer 2006: 263–4 considers other possibilities, including the Gupta era of  319/20 CE, the Kanisksa era (with hundreds omitted) beginning in 127/8 CE, and the  era of the Tochi Valley inscriptions of 223 CE, but her arguments in favor of the  Laukika/Saptarsis era (later used by the Palola Sāshis of Gilgit, as discussed in the fol- lowing subchapter) are convincing.  308 Melzer 2006: 257–262 discusses the historical context of these rulers, whose  names and titles are attested in lines 37–39 of the inscription’s donative formula  (274).  309 Melzer 2006: 256; Grenet 2002: 210 suggests that eastern Bactria may have been  the original base of the Hephthalites, and argues that the later Hephthalites continued  to control the area around Surkh Kotal in the Surkh-ab valley on the route between  Kunduz and Kabul. 310 Bühler, Georg. 1892. “The New Inscription of Toramana Shaha.” Epigraphia  Indica 1, 238–241; Sircar 1965: 422–424 (no. 56); Tsukamoto 1996: 976–978.  </page> <page sequence="100"> 164 chapter two donor named Rotas-siddhavrdsdhi, a ‘master of the monastery’ who was  the son of Rotas-jayavrdsdhi, a ‘master of many monasteries’ (aneka- vihārasvāmino), extended the merit of the donation to his own broth- ers, wives, sisters, sons, and daughters and to all of the queens, princes,  and princesses of Mahārāja Toramānsa and Sāsha Javūkha (written  Jaūvkha), and expressed the wish that his religious offering (deyad- harma) be used for the “attainment of supreme knowledge by all  beings.”311 The names and titles of the Masters of the Monastery, whose  “special prosperity” (viśesas-vrsddhi) was “praised and honored by the  lord of Naścīra” (Bühler 1892: 241), corroborates Gregory Schopen’s  hypothesis that some Buddhist monasteries were privately owned and  inherited by prosperous families responsible for their maintenance  and supervision.312 The last line of the inscription seems to have been  intentionally defaced, and the designation of the Mahīśāsakas (ācārya  mahīś[āsakānāms]) as recipients of the donation may have been forged.313  Although this area has not been carefully surveyed for Buddhist and  other archaeological remains, the significance of a monastery located  at Kura is probably related to efforts by Hun rulers such as Toramānsa  (and his son Mihirakula) to maintain access to the “salt road” between  Kashmir and the Salt Range.314 311 Since the copper scroll inscription (Melzer 2006) clearly differentiates Toramānsa  from Javūkha, earlier interpretations of Jaūvkha or Jaūvla (as read by Bühler in line  10) as an epithet of Toramānsa should be discarded, although the relationship between  Javūkha and Toramānsa remains unclear. Epigraphic parallels for this donative for- mula are compiled by Schopen 1979: 5–9 (-2005: 227–231), who argues that this stan- dardized formula does not necessarily indicate Mahāyāna affiliation. 312 Schopen, Gregory. 1996b. “The lay ownership of monasteries and the role of the  monk in Mūlasarvāstivādin monasticism.” Journal of the International Association of  Buddhist Studies 19.1, 81–126 (= Schopen 2004: 219–259) provides other epigraphic  references to the possession of monasteries by lay donors, including vihārasvāmins. 313 Salomon, Richard. 2009. “The Fine Art of Forgery in India.” In Écrire et trans- mettre en Inde Classique.

An inscription  written on a colossal red sandstone sculpture of the boar avatāra of  Visnssu as Varāha at Eran (ancient Airikinsa) in western Madhya Pradesh  clearly indicates that a family of local Brahmin Mahārājas who had  ruled under the Guptas until at least 484–5 CE switched their alle- giance to Mahārājādhirāja Toramānsa within the first year of his Indian  conquests.315 This expression of obeisance by a local feudatory named  Dhanyavisnssu who had a Vaisnssava temple constructed at this site shows  that the Hūnsa domain extended deep into the former territory of the  Guptas, but does not really support Upendra Thakur’s Hinduization  argument that the “culturally weak” victors (the Hūnsas) “succumbed  to the overwhelming cultural superiority of the vanquished and gradu- ally forgot all about their earlier faiths and beliefs” (1967: 260). The  adoption of Vaisnsava symbols such as the conch and the appearance of  Laksmsī on some coins issued by Toramānsa hardly “point to his strong  leanings to the Brāhmansic religion” or “mark his emergence as a con- vert to Hinduism” (Thakur 167: 261), since other issues with fire altars  and polyvalent disks (cakras) circulated more widely. A copper-plate inscription dated in the third year of Toramānsa’s  reign found near Sañjeli in Gujarat records donations of commodities  by local and long-distance merchants to a Vaisnssava temple of the deity  Jayasvāmin.316 The temple was built by Virādshyika, the queen-mother  of Mahārāja Bhūta, a regional overlord (visasyapati) subservient to  Toramānsa, who is given Gupta imperial titles (Paramabhattsāsraka  Mahārājādhirāja).

The construction  and repair of a sun temple not very far way at Mandasor (Daśapura)  in the neighboring region of Mālava by a guild of silk weavers demon- strates that commercial patronage of non-Buddhist temples sustained  religious establishments during a period of considerable dynastic flux  in the fifth and sixth centuries as the Hūnsas contended with Guptas  and emergent regional rulers for control of pivotal links between the  Indian hinterland and the western coast.317 Literary traditions associate Toramānsa’s son Mihirakula with reli- gious oppression and the downfall of Hūnsa power in India, but the  evidence from epigraphy and archaeology is ambiguous. In an inscrip- tion dated in Mihirakula’s fifteenth regnal year, a local donor of a  sun temple in Gwalior praises Toramānsa and Mihirakula as power- ful sovereigns, indicating that the hegemony of the Hūnsas continued  to be acknowledged in areas of north-central India during the early- mid sixth century.318 However, the Aulikara rulers of Daśapura in the  Mālava region resisted Hūnsa domination, according to the Rīsthal  inscription of Prakāśadharman, who made grandiose claims of defeat- ing Toramānsa in battle, using the tusks of his vanquished elephants  to make ivory seats for ascetics and dedicating the females of his  harem to the temple of Lord Vrssasbhadhvaja (Śiva).319 In two sand- 317 Fleet 1888: 79–88, no. 18, pl. 11; Sircar 1965: 299–304, no. 24. 318 Fleet 1888: 161–164, no. 37, pl. 22B; Sircar 1965: 424–426, no. 57.

The  Rīsthal inscription is dated in 515 CE (Mālava year 572). Salomon points out that  this date does not mark a terminus ante quem for the reign of Toramānsā, since “the  rhetorical claim of his submission to the Aulikara king proves nothing more than  that the two came into conflict, and that Prakāśadharman was not conquered by the  Hun” (1989: 27). </page> <page sequence="103">  historical contexts 167 stone pillar inscriptions,320 Yaśodharman, who apparently succeeded  Prakāśadharman, also claims to have subjugated Mihirakula, “whose  forehead was pained through being bent low down by the strength of  [Yaśodharman’s] arm in obeisance” (Fleet 1888: 148). In this praśasti to  Yaśodharman’s superiority over Mihirakula, the poet Vāsula remarks  that Mihirakula did not render homage to anyone else except Śiva  (Sthānsu), which leads some historians (such as D.C. Sircar) to suggest  that Mihirakula was indeed a Śaiva ruler,321 although it seems more  likely that this convention is more directly related to the importance of  Śiva as the family deity (istsasdevatā) of this branch of the Aulikaras. Mihirakula is depicted as a violent tyrant and as a persecutor of  Buddhists in the accounts of Chinese visitors to South Asia, but his  rule in Gandhāra, the Punjab, and Kashmir does not appear to have  had a negative impact on the growth of Buddhist monasteries. Song  Yun, an official Wei envoy, visited the court of the Hephthalite (Heda)  ruler in eastern Afghanistan in 519 CE with Huisheng and continued  traveling to Swat and Gandhāra in 520 CE.322 In contrast to the ruler  of Swat, who is depicted as a diligent Buddhist vegetarian, Song Yun  described the Hephthalite ruler of Gandhāra as a bloodthirsty enemy  of Buddhists: The nature of the king is violent and cruel, very often conducting mas- sacres. He does not believe in the Buddhist faith, but well worships their  own heathen gods. As all the inhabitants in the country are Brahmans  who respect Buddhism by much reading the sutras, so it is deeply against  their wishes that they suddenly have such a king.323 In contrast to John Marshall (1951: 1.76–7) and other historians (cited  by Kuwayama 2002: 108) who claim that the Hephthalites destroyed  Buddhist monasteries in Taxila and elsewhere, Kuwayama empha- sizes that “no statement is made in any paragraph proving that the  320 Fleet 1888: 142–150, nos. 33–34, pl. 26B–C; Sircar 1965: 418–420, no. 54. 321 Sircar 1965: 419, n. 4 states unequivocally that Mihirakula was a devotee of Śiva.  From a numismatic perspective, Grenet observes, “This ruler’s own religious sympa- thies are expressed by the Shivaite trident and bull symbols prominently displayed on  his coins” (2002: 211). 322 There is no specific reference to Mihirakula in Song Yun’s Luoyang Qielan ji  (translated by Beal 1884: c; Chavannes, Édouard. 1903. “Voyage de Song Yun dans  l’Udyāna et le Gandhara (518–522 p.C).” Bulletin de l’École française d’Extrême-Orient  3, 379–440; and Jenner, W.J.F. 1981.

He cautions that Chinese Buddhist  monks were especially concerned with “extinction of the True Law”  and attributed persecution of Buddhism in Gandhāra to Mihirakula  because he was a known historical figure associated with cruelty.324  Kuwayama’s criticism may be applied to Xuanzang’s recapitulation  of Mihirakula’s attempt to persecute Buddhists when he ruled Śākala  (modern Sialkot in the Punjab) “several hundred years ago” (Li 1996:  114). Xuanzang described Mihirakula as “a man of talent and intelli- gence with a bold and furious nature” (Li 1996: 114) who ordered the  destruction of Buddhism and expulsion of monks after a royal servant  (rather than a learned monk) was appointed as his Buddhist precep- tor. The narrative of Mihirakula’s alleged persecution of Buddhism is  linked with a story of his capture by King Balāditya of Magadha, whose  mother spared Mihirakula from capital punishment. While it is tempt- ing to identify Balāditya with a later Gupta ruler (such as Narasimsha  Balāditya), Balāditya was a common epithet and the story as well as  Mihirakula’s subsequent campaigns against Gandhāra from a base in  Kashmir appear to be anachronistic. Although Mihirakula is described  in the Rājataran֛ginsī as a “royal Vetāla (vampire) day and night sur- rounded by thousands of murdered human beings” (Stein 1900: i.291),  a major Buddhist shrine at Harwan was built during this period of  Hephthalite rule.325 Despite a reputation for cruelty in several literary  sources, Mihirakula and his Hūnsa predecessors may be compared to  other “foreign successors [who] legitimated their presence in the same  way that the new Indian dynasties clung to some Gupta formulae”  (Williams 1982: 102). The Hūnsas were probably expelled from central  India by the middle of the sixth century, but continued to be perceived  as foreign threats to north India from the Punjab, Kashmir and the  northwestern frontiers.326 324 Kuwayama 2002: 109. 325 Stein remarks that the “legendary anecdotes . . . reproduce faithfully the popular  tradition regarding the king such as had developed in Kaśmīr within a century of  his death” (1900: 1.78).

Frantz Grenet argues that “a second Buddhist conquest of  Central Asia” during the Hephthalite period was “more far-reaching  than the first one in the Kushan period” (2002: 213). In support of  this assertion, he refers to Pierfrancisco Callieri’s identification of  an early sixth-century soapstone statuette of a female playing a harp  imported from Gandhara or Kashmir to Merv, where it was deposited  in a stūpa with a reliquary, Brāhmī manuscript fragments, and other  small figurines.327 Although an earlier stūpa may have been established  in Merv sometime prior to this period, material evidence of contact  between Buddhist cultures in northwestern India and western Cen- tral Asia supports Callieri’s hypothesis that “the westward expansion  of Budhism may therefore have profited from the temporary political  subjugation of Margiana” (1996: 399) by the Hephthalites in the fifth  and sixth centuries. The Hephthalites also had an impact on the establishment of a tri- angular network for long-distance trade dominated by Sogdian mer- chants.328 Over 600 Sogdian graffiti and Bactrian inscriptions in the  530 CE. Schwartzberg, Joseph. 1992 [1978]. Historical Atlas of South Asia. Chicago:  University of Chicago Press proposes that the Hūnsas were assimilated into Indian  society while continuing to wage wars against the Maukharis and other post-Gupta  rulers of north India. The Hūnsas were stereotyped as enemies to be conquered in the  northern direction in epigraphic praśastis and Sanskrit literary epitomes of heroic  conquests, according to Pollock 2006: 244 (referring to an inscription written during  the reign of Nārāyansapāla, 875–932 CE, extolling anachronistic conquests of Hūnsas  by his Pāla predecessors).  327 Pierfrancisco Callieri. 1996. “Hephthalites in Margiana?

Whitfield, ed. London: British Library, states: “the Huns’ invasions in Central Asia  gave way to the sole domination of the Sogdians on the caravan routes of Central  Asia” (23). 329 Sims-Williams, Nicholas. 1989–1992. Sogdian and other Inscriptions of the Upper  Indus I, II. Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum v. 3, part 2. London: SOAS; Bandini- König and Fussman 1997 [MANP 2]. 330 “Hun” (Sogdian xwn) is well attested as a component of names in at least 15  Sogdian inscriptions from the Upper Indus (Sims-Williams 1989–92: 2.80 [glossary]).  La Vaissière 2005: 82–83, 87, 108 proposes that an absence of Hun patronyms may  indicate that Sogdian merchants ceased to use routes through the Upper Indus when  the Hephthalites split the Kidāra kingdom in the first half of the 5th century, but such  a short chronology for the Sogdian presence in the Upper Indus region is unlikely.  331 Kuwayama ties a “drastic change” (2002: 149, 194) in the itineraries of Chinese  pilgrims and Indian monks from earlier routes through the Karakorum and eastern  Hindu Kush to later patterns of travel through the western Hindu Kush (particularly  Bamiyan) to the decline of the Hephthalites around 550 CE. However, Brāhmī and  Proto-Śāradā inscriptions from the Upper Indus demonstrate continuous movement  through the 7th century instead of a disruption in the 6th century. The epigraphic  evidence from northern Pakistan is treated in greater detail in Chapter 5: Capillary  Routes in the Upper Indus. 332 Grenet 2002: 213, 221; Kuwayama 2002: 210. 333 Grenet 2002: 214–218; Kuwayama 2002: 194–199, 211–221. </page> <page sequence="107">  historical contexts 171 Palola Sāshis of Gilgit: Élite Patrons in a Buddhist Enclave The Palola Sāshis, a local dynasty of rulers in Gilgit from the late sixth  to early eighth century CE, supported the production of Buddhist San- skrit manuscripts and bronze sculptures at an important administra- tive and cultural hub in a network of deep valleys in the Karakorum  mountains. Manuscript colophons, stone inscriptions, and inscribed  bronze sculptures serve as primary sources for Oskar von Hinüber’s  reconstruction of the chronology and genealogy of this family of Bud- dhist patrons.334 A collection of manuscripts discovered in 1931 west  of Gilgit near the village of Naupur in the Kargah valley clearly dem- onstrates that local Buddhist literary culture flourished during this  period. The extensive range of Buddhists texts, including 532 folios  of the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya, represented in the Gilgit manuscripts  seems likely to have belonged to a monastic library, despite arguments  to the contrary by Gérard Fussman and Gregory Schopen based on an  absence of architectural evidence of monastic structures.335 Although  absolute dates for the manuscripts can not be determined, Hinüber  proposes a terminus ante quem around 630 CE based on the use of  the so-called Round Brāhmī script before its replacement by Proto- Śāradā.336 334 Hinüber, Oskar von. 2004.

Navasurendra has full imperial titles in a Sanskrit stone inscription  at Hatun in the Ishkoman valley written in the Proto-Śāradā script  and dated in year 47 of the Laukika era, corresponding to 671 CE.340  would correspond to 627/8 CE if calculated according to the same century of the  Laukika era as the Hatun inscription of year 47 (671 CE) and the Dainyor inscrip- tion of year 62 (687 CE).

In the second  image, the ruler himself holds a manuscript, perhaps reflecting the role  of his family in Buddhist literary production.

These sculptures now in the Jhokang Palace  in Lhasa and Tsaparang were probably brought to Tibet following the downfall of  the Palola Sāshis during the period when Gilgit and surrounding valleys in northern  Pakistan were occupied by a Tibetan military force between 720–745 CE. 348 Fussman 1993b: 40–43, pl. 30; Hinüber 2004: 38–42, nos. 14, 16, pls. 5, 7; Paul  1986: 202–218. 349 Fussman 1993b: 43–7, pl. 31; Hinüber 2004: 39–40, no. 15, pl. 6; Paul 1986:  219–243. </page> <page sequence="112"> 176 chapter two Shortly after the heyday of Buddhist patronage by the Palola Sāshis in  the beginning of the eighth century, their realm became a key battle- ground in the struggle between the Tibetan and Chinese empires for  control of long-distance routes through the high mountain border- lands. After Little Bolor (presumably controlled by the Palola Sāshis)  made an alliance with Tang China in 717 CE to deter growing Tibetan  influence in the Karakorum and Pamir mountains, Tibetan forces  occupied the region in 722 and 737.350 Huizhao (Hye Ch’o), a Korean  monk who traveled from Kashmir to Bolor, reported that Greater  Bolor was controlled by Tibetans and Lesser Bolor was under Chinese  dominion before 727 CE: Greater Bolor was originally the place where the king of Lesser Bolor  resided. It was because the Tibetans have come that he fled and shifted  his residence to Lesser Bolor. The chiefs and common people remained  and did not come.351 In 747 CE a Chinese expedition of 10,000 men led by the Korean gen- eral Gao Xianzhi crossed the Pamirs and defeated a Tibetan garri- son in the Wakhan valley of present-day northeastern Afghanistan.352  The Chinese force reached Gilgit through the Yasin valley and sub- sequently conquered the capital of Baltistan (Great Bolor), located at  present-day Katsura near Skardu, in 753.353 As a result of the intense  conflict between Tibet and China for control of this strategic region in  the middle of the eighth century, the Palola Sāshi dynasty disappeared,  but religious and cultural exchanges between this region, Central Asia,  and the Tibetan plateau are likely to have intensified.354 350 Beckwith, Chistopher. 1987.

The singular patronage of Buddhist literature and art by the Palola  Sāshis in Gilgit contrasts with complex patterns of support for religious  institutions affiliated with multiple traditions by their northwestern  neighbors and North Indian contemporaries. The survival of at least  eight Buddhist monasteries in Gilgit long after the period of the Palola  Sāshis is attested in a Khotanese Śaka account of an itinerary from the  Tarim Basin (via Gilgit) to Kashmir during the reign of Abhiman- yugupta (958–972 CE).356 However, the number of small monasteries  in Gilgit and other places along the route through the Upper Indus  region pales in comparison to countless small monasteries and a large  monastery with a dharmarāja stūpa and five hundred rock cells in  Kashmir. While overlapping with the period of the Palola Sāshis, the  Kārkotass (ca. 625–855/6 CE) ruling in Kashmir identified themselves  as Vaisnssavas, but continued to establish and support numerous Bud- dhist establishments against the backdrop of a flourishing Śaiva literary  culture.357 For example, in the Rājataran֛ginsī, Kalhansa refers to King  Bon’s foreign origins, which it locates to the south-west of Tibet where India meets the  fringes of Iran” (1972: [2]35). 355 Adapted from Hinüber 2004: 99. 356 Bailey, Harold W. 1936. “An Itinerary in Khotanese Śaka.” Acta Orientalia 14,  261–262; Hinüber 2004: 74–76; Skjærvø, Prods O. 2002.

Inscriptions issued  by the Maitrakas of Valabhī, who succeeded the Guptas and Hūnsas  in Gujarat from the sixth to the eighth century, demonstrate com- plex patterns of religious patronage. The Maitrakas typically referred  to themselves as Śaivas (parama-māheśvaras), but approximately a  quarter of their inscriptions record donations to Buddhists (including  a famous monasic center at Valabhī).361 In the account of his visit to  Buddhist sites in North India, Xuanzang portrays King Harsasvardhana  of Kanyākubjā (Kanauj) as a major Buddhist patron and convert  who was targeted by “heretics” in a failed assassination attempt, but  Harsasvardhana’s own inscriptions and Bāna’s poetic account of his  deeds in the Harsascarita depict him as a Śaiva.362 After his death in  647/8 CE, the Pālas of Bihar and Bengal (ca. 750–1200), who struggled  with the Pratihāras of western India and the Rāstsrsakūtass of the Dec- can for control of the Ganga-Yamuna heartland, explicitly identified  themselves as Buddhists (parama-saugata) and were responsible for  constructing and expanding many of the great Buddhist monasteries  in eastern India.363 However, their support for Buddhist institutions  hardly precluded patronage of Śaiva temples and monasteries, which  flourished in a competitive religio- political environment of appropria- tion and mutual exchange of rituals, iconography, and esoteric ideolo- gies. The Bhaumak aras in Orissa (ca. 736–950) and the Candras in  southeast Bengal (ca. 850–1050) followed the Pāla lead in adopting  Buddhist epithets while supporting a variety of religious institutions.  Buddhist institutions continued to feature prominently in South Asian  intellectual and cultural life, particularly in northwestern and north- eastern borderland areas which served as bases for expansion across  the Himalayas to Tibet and via maritime networks to Southeast Asia. 361 Sanderson 2009: 72–73; Schmiedchen, Annette. 1993. “Einige Besonderheiten der  buddhistischen Schenkungsinschriften unter den Maitrakas.” Beiträge des Südasien- Instituts der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin 1 (“Maitraka-Studien”), 83–108. 362 Li, Rongxi (trans.). 1996: 141–150. 363 Davidson 2002: 51–62; Sanderson 2009: 80–117; Thapar 2003: 409–411; Tripathi  1942: 354–363.  </page> <page sequence="116"> 180 chapter two Conclusions This overview of ancient and early medieval South Asian historical  contexts provides a framework for understanding diachronic pro- cesses in the formation and expansion of the early Buddhist san֛gha  across regional and cultural horizons, with a general emphasis on the  northwestern frontiers of the Indian subcontinent from the time of  Aśoka to ca. 750 CE. Having completed a whirlwind tour of over a  thousand years of South Asian Buddhist history, a pause to reconsider  the questions posed at the beginning of this chapter highlights signifi- cant patterns. Passages from inscriptions and texts reveal that much was at stake  in shaping Buddhist religious identities through the development of  narratives about the historical Buddha (whose parinirvānsa probably  dates between 400–370 BCE), previous Buddhas, their prior lifetimes,  and early followers. By drawing connections between these figures  and places in particular chronological frameworks of the past, pres- ent and future, hagiographical narratives illustrate core doctrinal  beliefs, situate authoritative discourses understood as buddhavacana,  establish institutional precedents, justify ritual practices, and promote  exchanges of material donations for religious merit. These versions of  Buddhist history had important ramifications for building networks of  patrons (including but not restricted to powerful rulers and wealthy  merchants) and transferring real and imagined religious topologies  linked with the Buddha to locations outside of his original homeland,  particularly to prosperous cities and agricultural areas. Interreligious contacts, intrareligious debates, and encounters with  exogenous groups played significant roles in shaping and changing  Buddhist practices and ideologies. The emergence of Buddhist tra- ditions of renunciation and the elaboration of doctrines of karmic  retribution resulted from competitive dialogues with other śramansa  movements (such as the Jains and Ājīvikas) and later Vedic tradi- tions undergoing processes of reformulation. Internal contestation  of monastic vinaya regulations and disputed interpretations of which  teachings to attribute to the Buddha caused divisions in the san֛gha  (san֛ghabheda). Alternative goals and practices sytematized (to vary- ing extents) in texts and images associated with “vehicles” (Mahāyāna  and Vajrayāna) developed in response to internal and external chal- lenges. Intercultural exchanges with migrating groups, especially in  </page> <page sequence="117">  historical contexts 181 the borderland regions of the northwestern Indian subcontinent, had  definite impacts on Buddhist material culture, as reflected in synthe- ses of Indian, Iranian, Hellenistic, and local features in art and archi- tecture. Indo-Iranians, Indo-Greeks, Sakas, Kusāsnsas, and Huns who  established various degrees of control over routes connecting Central  Asia to South Asia greatly enhanced patterns of cross-cultural contact.  Inscriptions recording donations by rulers, family members, and offi- cials associated with these social outsiders demonstrate that their con- tributions to the expansion and consolidation of Buddhist institutions  also aided their assimilation by providing cultural legitimation. Poli- tial and religious dynamics were closely intertwined with social and  economic changes, since Buddhist monasteries were often clustered  near hubs of commerce and administration on long-distance regional  routes which Indian and non-Indian rulers vied to dominate. Religious economies of exchange based on the awarding of merit for  material support of Buddhist monks and nuns had important histori- cal ramifications within and outside of South Asia. The literary legacy  of the Mauryan emperor Aśoka as a cakravartin who donated gener- ously and exclusively to the san֛gha provided an exemplary model for  later Buddhist rulers. However, his edicts endorsing (mostly) nonvio- lent victory by imperial dharma and promoting donations to other  śramansas and brahmins were less univalent. Whether or not the Bud- dhist model of Aśoka was in fact emulated by later rulers (such as  Menander and Kanisksa), the normative ideal of generous patronage  to Buddhist and other religious institutions required basic conditions  of commercial or agricultural prosperity, which in turn depended on  local, regional, and long-distance economic networks. Changing pat- terns of patronage and exchange affected the religious economy, since  dynastic turmoil, abandonment of old routes and the development of  new networks, and a general shift toward permanent endowments by  merchant guilds and land grants by rulers had significant implications  for the fortunes of Buddhist monasteries. Thus, paths for Buddhist  transmission did not remain stable or fixed, but adapted to fluctuating  economic and political conditions. </page> <page sequence="118">  </page> </plain_text>
