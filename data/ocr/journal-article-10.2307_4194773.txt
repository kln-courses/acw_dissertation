Analytically, however, the structural bases of conflict are triangular: in politics, moving among the poles of centralization, mass participation, and a decentralized balance of powers; in religion, the corresponding poles are church hierarchy, sect enthusiasm, and spiritual elites. Rebellion against authority and tradition can take place from any pole toward any other. During the Reformation and the religious wars, neither Protestantism nor Catholicism could be arrayed along the modernist dimension of liberals and conservatives; in many respects, the social organization of the Catholic church made it more anti-traditional than Protestantism. It is the period of struggle for secularization and religious toleration which crystalized in the liberal/conservative polarization of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. This binary dimension has broken down again in the late 20th century, giving rise to the self-doubts manifested in the ideology of 'postmodernism'.

For several hundred years, the West has shown the propensity to categorize both its social con- fficts and its trajectories of historical change in terms of a single continuum. In politics we attempt to array our factions along the spectrum from 'Right' to 'Left'; in religion we label 'traditionalists' and 'liberal reformers', just as in arguments over cul- tural styles we generally distinguish 'con- servatives' and 'progressives'. Such factional labels carry with them an implicit theory of historical change. The conjure up an axis along which it is taken for granted that societies will eventually move 'forward'. Opposition can sometimes reverse the direction and attempt to move a society 'backward', but there is no such thing as 'sidewards' movement because we are tacitly assumed to be locked on a single track. This assumption of a bipolar continuum is itself the main characteristic of 'modem' culture. The very notion first became popu- lar in the conflict between proponents of the 'ancients' against the 'moderns' in literature, which broke out in France and England in the late 1600s. The lines of conflict were soon generalized. The various components of what came to be regarded as 'modernity', or alternatively as 'liber- alism' or 'progress', in religion as in politics, came together in the 1700s, and their 'con- servative' counterparts came together as an explicit ideology and an explicit political/ religious faction soon after. In what follows I will develop two themes. One is that the bipolar distinction with which we are familiar arises from an historically specific combination of ingredi- ents. The political and religious confficts during the period of the Reformation and the rise of the bureaucratic state were at first far too multi-sided for their con- temporaries to press them into a simple mold of moving 'forward' or 'backward' in history. I will attempt to show that it has been later thinkers, operating under the assumptions of a 'modernist' ideology, who ? Scandinavian Sociological Association, 1992 171</page><page sequence="2">have retrospectively imposed a 'progress- ive' vs. 'reactionary' character upon the contending groups of that period. The most famous argument about those times, Max Weber's analysis of Protestantism, suffers from just this ideological bias. I will attempt to show how the modem polarization into 'left' and 'right' within both religion and politics is a product of the period of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and to suggest that this polarization reached its peak in the early 20th century. We must now ask ourselves whether this lineup is breaking down in the late 20th century; whether the period of 'progressives' vs. 'conservatives', having lasted for about 200-250 years, is now disappearing and being replaced by something else. The second theme is an analytical one. The 'progressive/conservative' distinction causes trouble because it is a unidi- mensional distinction imposed upon a mul- tidimensional reality. To develop a more realistic theory we must separate out the different dimensions. I will start with the latter point first. In my discussion I will typically use the terms 'liberal', 'progressive', 'leftist' and 'modernist' as labels for the same large ideological- camp; and the terms 'con- servative', 'traditionalist', 'rightist' and 'anti-modernist' for the opposition camp. It should be apparent that my usage carries a certain amount of irony, since my argument will attempt to show that such camps are ideological myths imposed upon a more complex organizational reality. The term 'liberal' poses particular problems, since there are sharp internecine conflicts between '19th century Liberals', who are legal libertarians and advocates of unfet- tered markets (and whose terminology con- tinues among 20th century European political parties), and 'liberals' in the 20th century Anglo-American sense, who are advocates of welfare state socialism. I will use the term 'liberal' in the more generic sense, as a social identity within the grand coalition of self-styled 'modernists' that emerged in the Enlightenment. The very fact that 'liberalism' broke into warring fac- tions in the 20th century is part of the historical dissolution of this coalition whose lifespan is narrated here. 2. The triangle of organizational conflicts The simple opposition between 'progress- ives' and 'traditionalists', 'liberals' and 'conservatives' is inadequate because social conflicts do not merely boil down to who is on top and who is fighting from below for change. Political organization more resembles a triangle (see Figure 1); and thus any conflict can mobilize change in two directions. At the apex we can put centralized authority. Here there is unity of command; orders are given at the top and are carried down through a hierarchy. One typical form of 'liberal' movement is the opposition to centralized power in the name 'the people' or 'democracy'. Organiza- tionally, what is being demanded here is mass participation. But mass participation is not always liberal. It can easily go in the direction of exalting the authority of the community, the control of the group over the individual. A powerful community is often traditionalistic; and mobilized masses are often particularistic, for instance defending the primacy of their ethnic iden- tity against others. There is another way that centralized authority can be opposed. That is by decen- tralization, limiting the power of the center. This is the model of the republic, the assembly of equals who decide together as a body, while guarding their own rights and spheres of action. In European history, this decentralized rule has its origins in the aris- tocracy; the late medieval version was the Standestaat, the balance of power by the estates, from which modem parliaments and independent judiciaries derived. Democratization via the route of mass par- ticipation and limitation on central auth- ority via the route of decentralization are two quite different things; they occupy dif- ferent poles at the base of the triangle, and often were in opposition to each other. The mass community sweeps everything from its path, including the rights and privileges of individuals; the decentralized balance of powers is anchored on autonomous centers of power, and tends towards aristocracy. Any of the three points of the triangle can represent either liberalism or conservatism, depending on which form has previously 172</page><page sequence="3">Centralization - bureaucracy mnass \ decentralization, participation, balance of powers, demoracy aristocracy/republic Figure 1. Triangle of political structures. had the greatest power and where oppo- sition to it is mobilized. Whenever oppo- sition comes, it always sets forth the abuses of its enemies and casts itself in the light of the bringer of benevolence and reforms. The centralized state can cast itself as the liberator from bigoted local communities and from the selfish authority of the barons; this was the claim of the early 'modernizing' state. Mass participation flies the banner of democracy when it fights to widen the franchise against the aristocrats or to over- throw the despotism of the center. Decen- tralizers claim to uphold freedom against both the regimentation of the center and the leveling of the crowd. The same triangle maps out the rival forms of religious organization (See Figure 2). At the apex we can put the centralized church, with its ecclesiastical hierarchy, its codified liturgy and doctrine. At the corner of mass participation is the sect, the com- munity of enthusiasts, drawn actively together in the spirit. At the other corner, decentralization, are the mystics, exalting the rights of. private spiritual experience; like political aristocrats, mystics are an elite, and monastic religions based on mys- ticism set off an aristocracy of the spirit. Religious reforms, like political ones, have gone around the triangle in every direction. Luther destroyed the monks as a lazy and privileged class; the medieval papacy often struggled against the superstitious excesses of the enthusiasts; the mystics fought for spiritual freedom against the hierocratic dognatists. The three points of the triangle do not usually exist in pure form. Alliances are possible among adjacent sides (see Figure 3). Soviet communism arose as an alliance of mass participation with a centralized administration. Anarchism, on the other hand, proposes to combine decentralization of power to the local level with mass par- ticipation in the collective unit. The cen- tralized authoritarian state in alliance with the privileged aristocracy produced the period of Absolutism in early modem Europe. One might even see a grand three- way alliance as the basis of Anglo-US lib- eral democracy: a centralized rule of law, balanced by independent centers of auth- ority, with leaders elected through mass participation. With the use of this triangle, we can see why the liberal/conservative dichotomy is so hard to apply consistently outside of a particular period in modem history. In ancient Greece, was Plato a liberal or a conservative? By modem standards, he appears as an authoritarian conservative in politics, though he claims a meritocratic and altruistic justification for his dic- tatorship of the philosopher-kings. In religion, on the other hand, Plato is a 173</page><page sequence="4">church!W hiechy, caSd docrn sect \YSd scs pietists, enthusasn itul eite Figure 2.

The strutural compromises of liberal democracy. liberal, opposed to the traditional com- munity practices for whose violation Soc- rates was executed. Similarly in China, it is hard to decide whether the Confucians were liberals or conservatives. They favour a benevolent rule and restrictions on the arbi- trary authority of the despot; at the same time they are reactionaries in upholding the ancient religious ceremonial, and, when political and economic reformers appeared during the Sung dynasty (llth and 12th centuries), the neo-Confucians staunchly opposed them in the name of tradition. If we are to continue to use the ter- minology of 'liberal' and 'conservative', we need to be aware that these have no fixed points on the structural triangle, in either politics or religion. We can continue to mean by 'liberal' the fighter against auth- oritarianism, the defender of the underdog, In religion, the 'liberal' position can be described as that which is anti-dogmatic, 174</page><page sequence="5">favorable to spiritual freedom and inno- vation. By extension, secularism can be put into the array of religious stances; secu- larism is the version of anti-dogmatism that stresses intellectual flexibility and discovery in realms that had previously been deter- iined by religious doctrine. But we cannot prejudge from which point of the triangle of religious organization a 'secular' move may be made. 'Secularism' in belief, like 'liberalism' in politics, is essentially oppo- sitional; it is a movement against one of.the points of the triangle. But just as 'liberation' can come by moving in any direction away from an established lineup of power, any move towards another corner of the triangle has the prospects of setting up a new auth- ority. Every revolt paves the way for a new orthodoxy, and hence for future revolt in a different direction. In the interest of showing how we have arrived at our own situation in the late 20th century, I will confine the rest of the illustrations to the Christian context. I will sample three periods in modern history. 3. From the Reformation to religious tolerance Our conventional view of the 1500s and 1600s is that this was a time when liberalism surged forward both in religion and in politics.' The Protestants, especially in England and Holland, are the heroes, fighting for religious and political liberty; the Catholics are cast as authoritarians and dogmatists, epitomized by the Spanish Inquisition and the condemnation of Galileo. We ought to recognize this as Prot- estant ideology. It has penetrated deeply into Anglophone, Germanic and Scandi- navian scholarship, where most of the clas- sic historical authorities have been Protestants. What this picture misses is the auth- oritarianism and intolerance found on the Protestant side as well. Insofar as the Ref- ormation was a revolt against the cen- tralized power of the Papacy, it moved the center of religious authority either to the local community or to the national state. In either case new forms of authoritarian coercion were applied. Calvinists favored very strong community control over the individual; Calvin's Geneva became a kind of early totalitarian state, and the Calvinist communities in the Netherlands were coercive to local nonconformists. Our image is of the Dutch fighting heroically for freedom against the Spanish Habsburg empire; but domestically they were viol- ently intolerant of opposition. The leader of the Arminian party was executed in 1618 by the Calvanists, and his supporter, Grot- ius, was sentenced to life imprisonment; when Grotius escaped he fled not to another Protestant country but to France and the protection of Cardinal Richelieu. The Protestant national churches were more efficient and better controlled than the old international Papacy; they were also more authoritarian. Thus we find, some- what to our surprise, that it was the Catholic theologians, especially in Spain and Italy, who opposed the Divine Right of Kings; the Jesuits Francisco Suarez and Cardinal Bellarmine argue for the limitation of the state, while it is the English theologians who support the religious claims of King James I. As the absolutism of the state grew, it was the Spanish Catholics who were among the first to put forth a claim for inalienable human rights; it was by the extension of the Thomist doctrine of natural law that the concept of international law was formulated by Cisneros, Las Casas, and Vitoria. It is these who articulated the rights of the Amerindians against the conquista- dors, just as they claimed limits on the power of the state to go to war. These are the leading Spanish theologians of the 1500s, contemporaries of the Reformation. Catholicism played the role of universalism because organizationally it was the more centralized and less parochial. The Prot- estants, mobilizing their local communities, were more caught up in local interests; at the extreme, community enthusiasm trans- lated into dogmatic intolerance. Formally, the Catholic church repre- sented the apex of the triangle, the centralized organization with the fixed doc- trine. But it was also the weaker organ- ization, and the more complex one. The Papacy was a sprawling international organ- ization, riven with internal conflicts. The Papal chancery and the legates sent as papal representatives throughout Europe repre- 175</page><page sequence="6">sented central authority. At the same time, a good deal of church property was locally held, and de facto accommodations had been reached by the 1300s with powerful kings (as in France, England and Spain) over lay power to tax church property. Cen- tral control of appointments had been expanding since the anti-simony reforms of the High Middle Ages, but de facto regional powers held sway here too. The monastic and mendicant orders provided another element of decentralization. They elected their own generals, held their own counsels, and managed their own property. The Orders thus operated within the church as the counterpart of the aristocracy and its parliamentary structures in the state, pro- viding a balance of power in clerical politics. During the early 1400s, there had been an explicit move to turn the entire church into a kind of republic, governed by regularly convening councils. But the counciliar movement failed, after the great Councils at Constance (1415-17) and Basle (1431- 49); liberal reformers like Cusanus, Bessa- rion and Piccolomini went over to the side of Papal centralization, because the coun- cils of prelates were deadlocked in factional bickering. At this point the decentralizing option appeared under the aspect of cor- ruption, and centralization looked to be the wave of reform. By most modern criteria, the Catholic church was more liberal than the Prot- estants until nearly 1700. This is not to deny that Catholics could also be extremely authoritarian. The Inquisition, the forced conversion and execution of Jews in Spain, the torture and burning of heretics were features of this period as well as earlier. But such practices were notspecific to Cath- olicism. The Protestants too burned their heretics; the execution of Servetus by Cal- vin at Geneva in 1553 set the stage for the burning of Bruno at Rome in 1600. Judicial torture was used on both sides. Witch-burn- ing blazed up during the conflicts of the religious wars, most luridly in Germany during the 1500s, but such executions con- tinued to be common in England until the late 1600s (Thomas 1971;451-456). By modern standards of individual rights, the entire period would be considered horrible; there was little to choose between Catholics and Protestants in this respect. If one were to stop the clock around the year 1520, which side would an impartial observer say looked more modem? If one means by this which side was reducing the authoritarianism of the state and the com- pulsory traditionalism of belief, the answer would almost certainly be the Catholic world. The Renaissance Popes were notable for supporting the humanist revival of classical learning, and sponsored neo- paganism in art and Platonist philosophy in the late 1400s. Leonardo da Vinci worked for Cesare Borgia, the military adventurer who was son of Pope Alexander VI (1492- 1503). The infamous Pope Julius II (1503- 13) was the patron of Raphael and Mich- elangelo; Copernicus lectured on astro- nomy in Rome in 1500, and later dedicated his new system to Pope Paul III (1534- 49).2 The Popes during the outburst of the Reformation (Leo X, 1513-21, and Clem- ent VII, 1523-34) are Medicis, from the Florentine family most strongly identified with patronage of the secular arts and paganizing philosophies. It was just this wordly munificence of the Papal court that aroused the Protestants and motivated Luther to call the Pope the 'Antichrist'.3 The Jesuits, founded in the 1530s, con- tinue just those themes which raised the ire of the Protestants. By the 1600s, English- speaking Protestants regarded the Jesuits in approximately the same way that their 20th century descendants regarded the KGB. In fact the Jesuits were rationalistic, innovative, and flexible. The Jesuits were anti-traditionalistic reformers, criticizing magic, legends and the worship of saints. They carried out a drastic reform of mon- astic life, abolishing choir, prayers, seclu- sion and distinctive uniforms, in favor of activism to transform the world. They con- structed a modem education system, estab- lishing free secondary schools open to all social classes, and teaching the latest cur- riculum including science. It is just these 'modernist' qualities that made them so suspect by the Protestants, who were advo- cating scriptural dogmatism and enthusi- astic faith. In politics, too, the Jesuits were at the liberal edge of their period. The Spanish 176</page><page sequence="7">Jesuit theologian Molina in the 1580s for- mulated an ethics of probabilism: cog- nitions are less true, the more general they are; concrete activity in the world always involves choices among mixed con- sequences of greater or lesser evil. This implied a politics of moderation; crusades and holy wars could not be justified, since no convictions could be certain enough to support a no-holds-barred conflict. The Jes- uits thereby became critics of the Divine Right of Kings and of the absolute authority of the state. By contrast, the doctrine cuius regio, eius religio that ended with the Ger- man religious wars in 1555 was an explicit denial of the separation of church and state; Calvinist theocracy was even more extreme in fusing both spheres into a single com- munity of faith and compulsion. Through the early 1500s and even later, it is the Catholics who are the liberalizers and secularizers; the Protestants are the reactionaries in most spheres. One is tempted to speculate that the West would have modernized more rapidly if the Prot- estant Reformation had not occurred. This is no doubt a shocking judgement, since we have been brought up on a social science formulated by Protestant and. Jewish scholars, both with a strong anti-Catholic tradition. This includes Max Weber, who inherited much of the viewpoint of German pietism. If by modernity we mean the com- plex of formalized bureaucracy in organ- ization, market capitalism in economy, parliamentary democracy in politics, and scientific secularism in culture, one can make out a case that these had more roots in Catholicism than in Protestantism.4 The bureaucratization of the West begins with the Papal bureaucracy of the Middle Ages; the church's universities are the base from which educated officials, originally clerics, spill over into administration. Market capi- talism, especially in its rationalized forms, has its first big upsurge again within the Middle Ages, and within a sector of the church: the round of expansion of the mon- asteries from 1050 to the 1200s was the cutting edge of economic development in Europe, setting off the first wave of agri- cultural capitalism as well as the first wave of mills and foundries; again in its later phase the market economy outgrows its church origins and expands into the secular sphere.5 The Protestants are not especially anti- modernist on these dimensions, but they are not very pro-modernist either. The Protestant shift towards mass community participation in the church is a de- bureaucratizing move, which had relatively little effect on the main trend toward bureaucratizing secular organization. The old Weberian issue of whether the Prot- estant theology gave impetus to entre- preneurial motivation has now been largely transformed by the recognition that capi- talist market structures existed very widely by the 1600s, and that the expansion of capitalism was especially in agriculture and in rural industries; capitalist participants in these were as likely to be aristocrats as bourgeois, and to belong to various religious faiths (Goldstone 1991:78-79, 141; Wallerstein 1989:3-53). There is no reason to believe that Protestantism was an essential ingredient either in the devel- opment of modern capitalism, or in any of the other features of modernity.6 Historical thought experiments are rather hard to make, insofar as our conception of past history is filled up with what actually hap- pened; nevertheless one can imagine that something like modern social and economic structures could have come about by the continuation of Renaissance Catholicism, minus the detour of the Reformation. But what about modern science? Our prevailing conception, again under the influence of Protestant historiography, is that science comes from the Protestant world and was opposed by the Catholic conservatives. Here we have another ver- sion of the simple imagery of Protestants as liberals in the realm of thought, opening the way for freedom of injury and breaking down traditionalism. Nevertheless there is plenty of Protestant opposition to scientific innovation; Copernicus was not very widely accepted by anyone, Protestant or Catholic, until well into the 1600s (Westman 1980); and the Protestant leaders were more con- cerned with returning to Biblical origins than with scientific innovations. The wave of enthusiasm for scientific discovery which begins around the 1590s is largely centered in the Catholic world, although it picks 177</page><page sequence="8">up supporters among the Protestants fairly rapidly too. Since Copericus (himself canon of a Catholic cathedral) was largely ipored for 60 years, the initial takeoff of sustained discovery in science comes pri- marily in mathematics; and here the leading innovators- Cardano and Tartaglia (1540s, Italy), ViOta (1590s, France), Descartes and Fermat (1630s/40s, France) - are all Cath- olics. Galileo, who popularizes new research methods in physics, gets in trouble with his church patrons in 1616 and again in the 1630s; nevertheless his own work originates in Catholic networks, and especially under the influence of pre- decessors in the Jesuit college at Rome. The Jesuits are active in the forefront of investigation from Clavius (1570s) to Cava- lieri (1630s), and Galileo's main disciples, Torricelli and Viviani (1640s/50s), like Des- cartes, are Jesuit pupils. As counterpoint to this movement of Catholic scientists we can muster Protestant names as well: Tycho Brahe and Kepler at Prague, Napier, Gilbert and Harvey in Britain, Stevin and Snel in Holland. But the Catholic world was the center of the scientific revolution, at least in its early phase. The social networks which make up the movement come together in Paris in the 1630s, around two priests, Mersenne and Gassendi; they establish a circle of cor- respondence that becomes the basis for the first system of scientific publications, and propagandize the works of Galileo, Des- cartes and their followers. The famous 'Invisible College' which formed in England during the Commonwealth in the 1650s was an offshoot of this Parisian network. Our Protestant-centered image emerges only if we focus on the late 1600s, when the Invis- ible College becomes the Royal Society, and Boyle and Newton become the famous Protestant scientists. But to project this picture backwards is an anachronism. I am not proposing the influence of a Weberian cultural ethos in favour of science but reversing its source to the Catholic side. I am not suggesting there was a 'Catholic ethic' that favored science, to substitute for the Mertonian Puritan ethos. The key features of the Catholic world were not ideological but structural. In the triangle of organizational forms, the Catholics are the cosmopolitans; I have suggested that they balance between the centralizing and rationalized doctrines of the Papacy and the aristocratic decentralization of the Orders. The Protestants rebel in the direction of mass participation by the local community; this tends to make them more emotional and also more traditionalistic; in addition, the Protestant tendency to fuse with the political organization of the state eliminates another space for freedom of intellectual action. The Catholic world was more open to science not as a matter of official policy, but because it was the more complicated organizational structure. It had more internal contradictions and conflicts. Wield- ing long-established administrative powers, the Catholic leaders tended to be more worldly, less dogmatic, more flexible. In the eyes of emotionally aroused opponents, this smacked of cynicism. Thus Cardinal Richelieu, virtual ruler of France during the years 1624-42 when he served as prime minister to a weak king, appeared in Anglo- Protestant eyes as a diabolical figure. For reasons of state, Richelieu could oppress the French Protestant minority while sur- reptitiously giving military aid to the Prot- estant armies who fought his own enemy, Catholic Spain. Richelieu is a patron of the avant-garde intellectuals; he supports the Descartes circle, and his personal employees (including his librarian, Naude) belong to a circle called the 'Libertins trud- its' consisting of skeptical freethinkers. Richelieu makes Paris the home for refu- gees evading religious persecution; Grotius escaping from the life sentence of the Cal- vinists in Holland is given aid by Richelieu; so is Campanella escaping from a Spanish prison in Naples. Richelieu is a liberal in religion as far as doctrinal matters go; he opposed the Huguenots because they are an organizational enemy of the centralized control of the Church as well as trouble- makers for the secular state. In politics, one would be tempted to label Richelieu a conservative, since he is the main architect of the centralizing French monarchy against the decentralizing opposition of the nobles; our judgement comes from the tradition of French aristocrats like Montesquieu and 178</page><page sequence="9">Tocqueville that saw centralized control as a threat to liberty. What we have come to think of as the modem connotation of 'liberal' and 'con- servative' was established only at the end of the 1600s. Richelieu seems to be a con- servative in politics and a liberal in religion; the great English propagandist of science, Francis Bacon, is another Machiavellian state minister, supporter of royal absolut- ism. The coalition of parliamentarist lib- erals in politics with secularizers in religion emerges around the 1690s. Now the center of 'modernization' shifts to England; the great figure is John Locke. The reason this comes about in a Protestant country, how- ever, is not because the intrinsic trajectory of the religion is towards tolerance, sep- aration of church and state, and political democracy. England was no center of tol- eration early in the century. Queen Eliz- abeth's physician, the Portuguese Dr Lopez, was tortured, castrated, disem- boweled and quartered in the year 1594, the standard punishment of the time, for alleged conspiracy with the Spaniards (Stra- chey 1928/1971:48-62). Bacon imagined science not as freedom of inquiry but as a centralized state directory of knowledge, and sent opponents like Sir Walter Raleigh to be beheaded at the Tower of London. Nor were the Puritans much better. Their dominance in the Commonwealth of the 1640s and 1650s was not a democracy but a military dictatorship. TQleration came when the religious wars were over; not because either side has wil- led it, but because none is able to force their doctrine on the others. It was the exhaustion of religious conflict that became institutionalized in British toleration; secu- larization triumphed because religious com- pulsion was stalemated. This took place in Britain not because it was a Protestant country, but because it was the site where struggles over religious organization hap- pened to become stalemated first. Organ- izationally, this meant that none of the three vertices of the triangle was able to destroy the others; we get instead a grand compromise among elements of each. Out of this compromise the modern conception of political/religious liberalism was born. 4. The Enlightenment and modem liberal/conservative polarization When we reached the 1700s we are on familiar terrain. In the French Enlight- enment we meet the 'modern' coalition. The philosophes and their supporters are liberals in politics, critiquing the Old Regime and preparing the way for the French revolution. In religion they are sec- ularizers, often materialists and atheists, or at least Deists, rejecting scriptural tradition and substituting a Supreme Being of reason. Even here there is some ambiguity in the meaning of political liberalism. That is because the Old Regime was a mixture of organizational forms, aristocratic plus monarchical; oppositional reform could push towards any of the points of the triangle. We can see this by looking briefly at several key figures. Montesquieu is the great advocate of con- stitutional government and the enemy of monarchical despotism. His doctrine of the separation of powers had great influence on Jefferson and on the formulation of the US constitution. But Montesquieu is not a democrat in the sense of mass participation. His base is the aristocracy, and it is the independent centers of power in the form of aristocratic privileges that provide his model for the ideal state. Montesquieu combines this decentralizing liberalism with a universalistic rationalism in the sphere of religion. He relativizes Christianity by writing from the point of view of a Persian visitor to the West, and simultaneously rela- tivizes Islam by exposing the arbitrary dif- ferences in customs. His religious message is implicitly towards secularization, or at least simplification of religion down to its transcultural essentials. Voltaire holds a similar attitude about religion. He satirizes the anthropomorph- ism-and the arbitrary customs of the Chris- tian scriptures, and battles against religious persecution. Voltaire's purified religion is Deism, the worship of Reason. In politics, Voltaire is a reformer, but his ideal is the enlightened monarch. Voltaire regards the aristocracy as upholders of unjust privilege 179</page><page sequence="10">and traditional prejudice. Often in exile from Paris, Voltaire found patronage from Frederick the Great. As a Deist, the Prus- sian king supported not only Voltaire but more extreme materialists such as La Mettrie. Frederick was struggling to bring his Prussian aristocracy under the control of the central state; his efforts to build a rationalized bureaucracy involved pressing the Lutheran clergy into government ser- vice as local records-keepers and school- masters. All this epitomized Voltaire's ideal of rationalized Absolutism, reform by cen- tralization under the rule of law. Montesquieu and Voltaire, despite their common 'liberalism', are at opposite cor- ners of the triangle in the organizational structure which they expected to be the vehicle for reform. Not surprisingly, they fell into conflict: Voltaire accused Mon- tesquieu of being a mouthpiece for the privileges of the aristocracy, and Mon- tesquieu regarded Voltaire as a facile court- ier. The third pole of the triangle was also represented, although it received less atten- tion. Jean Meslier, a country priest, ful- minated against the privileges of all hier- archies, ecclesiastical, aristocratic and mon- archical alike. He regarded scriptural religion as a tool invented to oppress the poor, and hoped for a revolution in which 'all the great ones of the earth, all the nobles, should be hanged and strangled in the entrails of the priests' (Hazard 1963:55). The revolution of 1789 brought together the critiques emanating from all three points of the triangle. Aristocrats revolted against the king, then lost their heads on the guillotine when power shifted to the crowd. The moment of revolt was organ- izationally unstable: the leaders of the crowd could not maintain power; Napoleon established a centralizing dictatorship, which in turn was followed by restoration of king and aristocracy. Christianity was abolished and then reestablished. The main political legacy of this period was that it established the ideal of the Left as a com- bination of all three lines of critique. Liberte, egalit, fraternit combined respectively the slogans of aristocratic decentralizers (liberty of individual rights), Centralizing absolutists (equality under the law), and mass participation (fraternity of the entire community). The French Revolution also marks the emergence of conservatism in the modern sense. Aristocratic opponents of the rev- olution like Chateaubriand and de Maistre are traditionalists in every dimension. The are authoritarians in politics, not in order to impose a uniformity of law, but because they advocate tradition for its own sake. Conservatism goes romanticist, opposed to the rationalism of the liberals; the con- servatives now uphold variety, arbitrari- ness, conventionality as it exists with all its historical peculiarities. They are similarly conservative in religion, upholding pre- cisely its mysteriousness, its opposition to rational understanding. The French con- servatives support the Pope, not because the Papacy is a center of universalism and codified doctrine, as a medieval reformer like Nicholas Cusanus had done, but because the Pope represents authority and tradition. One might ask how modern conservatism stands with respect to the triangles of pol- itical and religious organization. The answer, peculiarly, is that it has no obvious home base from which to implement its stance. Modern conservatism is romanti- cist, not least because it is an anti-rationalist opposition to all existing conditions; it likes neither the greater participation of the masses, the uniformity imposed by the cen- tral state, nor the autonomous rights of the individual. It is not surprising that modern conservative movements have temporarily embraced each organizational alternative: the authoritarian state, the fascist mass movement, the disdainful aristocrat. Mod- ern conservatism exists in purity only in the realm of ideology; its anchor is not an organizational structure but rather the existence of liberal opponents. Modern conservatism crystalizes later than modern liberalism, because it is a reaction against liberalism. And since modern liberalism consists in the omni-alliance of all three points of the triangle - centralized rule of law, decentralized autonomous rights, mass participation - modern conservatism has nowhere to go except to be a pure oppo- sition, negating wherever it can, while in 180</page><page sequence="11">practice it is forced to use the organizational weapons of its opponents. 5. Liberalism and conservatism at the turn of the 20th century Let us skip ahead another 100 years. In the late 1800s and early 1900s the liberal/ conservative dimension is congruent between religion and politics. Moderate religous reformers become welfare state activists. In England the proponents of Idealist philosophy turn religion into a gen- eralized spirituality and moral activism; T. H. Green, Bosanquet, and Toynbee become spearheads of the welfare mission to the poor. Those further left in politics are also further left in religion. The Marx- ists are militant opponents of class privilege and militant atheists. The same is true of left intellecuals short of the revolutionary extreme. Bertrand Russell is a famous athe- ist and a famous liberal. This package holds together through the 1930s and 1940s. The Vienna Circle of logical positivists are mili- tant critics of everything that smacks of religion; they aim their weapons of purified reason against the vestiges of faith still found in the halfway house of Idealist phil- osophy. The logical positivists are perhaps the apex in Western history of militant secu- larism; their reform in the realm of belief is to replace every vestige of God with the methods of science. In politics, the logical positivists are far to the left. The Vienna Circle leader, Neurath, was an active social- ist. With the rise of the Nazis, the oppo- sition was made even more explicit: on one side militant conservatism in politics and anti-rationalism in belief; on the other side, militant liberalism in politics and a militant attack on non-rational belief. With Karl Popper, writing explicitly with the Nazis in mind, non-scientific thinking is equated with the road to fascism. The conservatism of this penod tends to shadow the liberals at every point. In the 19th century, as philosophical idealists were turning religion into moral activism, Kier- kegaard reacted by stressing the arbitrary and miraculous in religion. In keeping with the symmetry of political and religious posi- tions, Kierkegaard was a reactionary in politics (Eagleton 1990:191-192). He writes just at the time that Denmark has adopted a liberal constitution allowing male suffrage, freedom of speech and religious tolerance. Kierkegaard took his stand against these concessions to 'the mob', extolling cen- sorship, monarchy and the established church. Kierkegaard was adopted as pre- cursor by the 20th century existentialists, particularly in their conservative branch. Here the leading figure was Heidegger, who writes at just the time of the Vienna Circle and was a prime object of their attacks. Heidegger is a former Catholic seminarian who adopts modem philosophical tools of phenomenology to produce a philosophy of genuine human existence. Heidegger regards science and technology as a mech- anical surface which hides the authenticity of existential experience; the core of that experience is profoundly anti-rational, a negation of reason for itself to exist, sheer arbitrary thrownness in the world. Hei- degger is a political conservative, who dal- lies with the Nazis and entertains the belief that their anti-rationalism represents a breaking through of modem inauthenticity. Heidegger is saved from all-out fascism by his pessimism; no mere social movement satisfies the deep incompleteness that con- servatives now see as the human condition. Another branch of the existentialists, the group around Sartre, Camus and de Beau- vior, maintains the classic combination of liberalism in both politics and religion. The existentialists are militant atheists, deter- mined that the human individual must cre- ate his or her own meaning of life. In effect they fuse religious and political action; the existentially authentic way of creating one- self is by making choices, and these are the choices for political combat. This Parisian existentialist circle is at its height during the Nazi occupation, and this setting shapes their position. Now the Left no longer has to depend upon science or reason; these are limited, unable to arrive at real human existence. Sartre recognizes that reason can give no grounds for itself, nor can reason answer Heidegger's question why anything should exist at all in the first place. But the upshot is to go back to neither political nor religious tradition. Instead the trajectory of 181</page><page sequence="12">opposition becomes a value in itself. Sartre and Camus organize the anti-Nazi under- ground; after the war Sartre throws his political energy into building a revol- utionary Left, de Beauvoir into creating a feminist movement. Camus makes oppo- sition into a self-grounding Cartesian for- mula: I rebel, therefore we exist. His work The Rebel became one of the favorite books of the American civil rights workers in the early 1960s. 6. And now what? In the 1980s and 1990s, the 'modem' liberal/conservative dimension that was created in the Enlightenment is in disarray. Avant-garde intellectuals consider them- selves 'postmodernists'. There is no basis of reason, no foundation for thought or action. 'Postpositivism' is in vogue. Logical positivists in the style of the Vienna Circle are now considered to be authoritarians of the mind; their leftist position in politics is forgotten, and they are lumped with their enemies as statist totalitarians. In their crit- ique of modem omni-commercialism, the postmodernists maintain some continuity with the themes of the Left, which is not surprising since the movement originated among disillusioned Parisian ex-Marxists. But the main oppositional dynamic is to repudiate the 'grand narratives' such as the political eschatology of Marxism; what is put in their place is a generalized dis- satisfaction with contemporary society in which everything is regarded as false. Such a stance would seem to continue at least an agnostic attitude towards religion. But the major theme of today's intellectuals is to prove that one is not intolerant of other positions; the positivist critique of religion is undermined, and faith is extolled as an authentic mode of life. The post- modernist intellectual is by no means a fundamentalist, but s/he is determined to offend no one's right to be fundamentalist in religion or chauvinistic in ethnicity, pro- vided that the religion or the ethnicity is not a dominant Western one. The correct Western intellectual today believes in noth- ing so strongly as the critique of Western rationality. The inteilectuals of the most popular left-oppositional movement, fem- inism, tend to adopt an essentialist stance that explicitly condemns moral univer- salism (e.g. Gilligan 1982). In the long run, we are apparently seeing a swing of the intellectuals away from their 'modernist' opposition to religious traditionalism. Late 20th century intellectuals have come around to the arguments put forward by conservative inteilectuals since the time of the French Revolution. It is not surprising that philosophical admiration has turned to those existentialists who were most pol- itically conservative and most anti-mod- ernist, Nietzsche and Heidegger. This swing of the intellectuals goes along with a general shift to the right. The politics of the 1980s saw the dominance of aggress- ively market-oriented regimes in the US, Britain, Japan and Germany and the fall of the welfare-state socialists from power in Sweden. With the collapse of the socialist regimes of the Soviet bloc, the Left is on the defensive everywhere. The underlying structural issue is not merely that capitalism rules the roost unabashedly, but that no alternatives are seriously envisioned to the dominance of private wealth in the market. There is a collapse of faith in the govern- ment to take effective action for the well- being of the people. Government is widely regarded as a clumsy, self-interested bureaucracy that strangles initiative; we have come almost to the complete negation of the views of Voltaire, aiming to use the laws of the enlightened state to defend all citizens against the inequalities of private privilege. In terms of the triangle (see Figure 4), the centralization point represents the state- administered economy; this is the socialist or welfare state conception which has become delegitimated today. Mass par- ticipation represents the ideal of local self- sufficient economic communities; today this alternative is little more than a romanticist image of the family farm or premodern village, although some utopian communes have attempted precariously to put it into practice from time to time. What remains is the decentralized economy of multiple centers; as in the political version, this arrangement is highly stratified, an econ- omic aristocracy rather than a feudal/ military one. The rights and privileges 182</page><page sequence="13">ecoy Figure 4. Triangk of economic structsres. which are guarded against centralizing con- trol are those of the business corporation; claiming autonomy from outside interference, today's corporation attempts to exert unrestricted authority over its sub- ordinates within. The world of corporations as a plurality of independent despotisms is an ideal type, not yet the dominant reality. It remains limited, partly because the laws of the cen- tral state still intrude, less and less to sup- port the rights of workers, but still in the form of regulation to protect ethnic min- orities and women, and to some extent consumers and the environment. The con- servative mood at the end of the 20th cen- tury idealizes private business, in large part because the alternative forms have been tried and failed to deliver on their ideo- logical promises. No doubt there will be a further wave of disillusionment in the future as the privileges of the new business aris- tocracy attract enemies, and their efficiency turns out to be no greater than that of other organizational forms. In the religious realm, the one organ- izational form that is thriving is the com- munity of mass participation. The activist period of the 1960s among leftist youth left its heritage primarily to the religious right. The participatory style includes the adop- tion of popular music, an anti-hierarchic liturgy, the emotional emphasis of devotion, even the deliberate use of psy- chological group dynamics techniques. The structures that have lost ground are the centralized churches, with their more pro- fessionalized staffs and more rationalized theologies. The third point of the religious triangle, the spiritual aristocracy of mystics, survives only marginally. Although there was an upsurge of interest in Hindu and Buddhist mysticism during the period of 'counterculture' mobilization in the 1960s, religious mysticism is hard to institutionalize without a monastic base; and modem Western society is structurally inhospitable to monasticism. Thus it appears that one point alone of the religious triangle is becoming dominant: the enthusi- astic community of mass participation. The thrust of such communities is towards con- servatism in the realm of doctrine, even if they are anti-traditionalist in liturgy; and they ally with conservatives in politics. This appears to be the pattern not only in Christianity but in the other thriving religions of the world - Islam and fun- damentalist Hinduism. Islam has always been a religion without a centralized hier- archy, even without a consecrated priest- hood; it is based on the community participation of all (male) believers, led by the most learned, pious, and enthusiastic. The local community authoritarianism of Islam exemplifies the ambiguities of the 183</page><page sequence="14">religious democracy of mass mobilization, unmitigated by the centralizing rule of law or autonomous rights anchored in decen- tralizing balance of powers. Because of this structural democracy of believers, Islam has one aspect that looks liberal in terms of Western traditions, while at the same time it reinforces extremely conservative posi- tions in terms of individual rights and cul- tural freedom. The structural mixture in Islam is quite different from the classic lib- eralism and conservatism of Europe since the Enlightenment. The religious future of the world seems to be a contest between rival conservatisms. The flourishing parts of both Islam and Christianity uphold scriptural par- ticularism, and thus seem destined to fuel mutually hostile nationalisms. The major structural difference is that fundamentalist Islam fuses religion with politics, whereas participatory communities in Christianity, despite their tendency to conservative poli- tics, tend to remain enclaves in the private sphere. Given the organizational structures of the Westem state and economy, this privatized religion seems likely to continue. The bureaucratic state, for all its unpopu- larity, is not easily penetrated by religious enthusiasm; any political gains for the religious right in enforcing their doctrines by govemment action are likely to under- mine religious faith through administrative banalities. In addition, there is a mismatch between the prevailing organizational forms of conservative religion - localized mass participation committees - and those of conservative economy - the dominance of the autonomous, hierarchic corporation. Structurally, contemporary conservatism is split among incompatible organizational forms. The history of liberalism has been the history of opposition by the underdogs, the unprivileged, against established power. Modern conservatism emerged as the oppo- sition to that opposition. Conservatism became popular in modern times because of the structural domination by the liberals. All three poles of the triangle have been tried as vehicles for overcoming domin- ation; all three turn into modes of dom- ination in their own right (see Figure 5). Have we now learned the lesson of history, that liberal reforms never deliver what they promise? But the victories of conservatives do not wipe the slate clean of problems; they just set up the next round of the fight. Liberalism, despite its tend- encies to self-destruct, also undermines its own self-destruction. Essentialist feminists nevertheless have to appeal to the universal rule of law for protection of women's opportunities; despite the rejection of alleged white male rationality and abstract rights, the interests of feminists put them in opposition to religious conservatives over issues like abortion and new reproductive technologies. In another area in which the liberal tradition has caught itself in con- tradictions, 'affirmative action' tracks appear to be permanently institutionalizing segregated career channels at the same time that they lessen inequalities. The liberal device for expanding minority educational opportunities, culturally specific tracks such as ethnic studies programs, promotes another version of separatism, along with ideologies of ethnic particularism and anti- Westernism. But although late 20th century liberalism undermines its own universalism in contents, the structures through which it operates are the classic liberal ones. It is through the rule of law, enforced by the centralized state, that these programs are put into effect. Moreover, conservatism, despite widespread popular agreement with its dislike of bureaucracy and centraliz- ation, seems to be making few inroads against just these kinds of laws and programs. Surprisingly, liberals and con- servatives are less far apart than they have been for centuries. Liberals have lost their faith in a superior rationality and in a reforming path to put it into effect; they keep on using the old liberal organizational techniques but their hearts are not in it. Conservatives seem to have won the philo- sophical battle but they have no organ- izational device for putting their beliefs into practice. The inertia and inevitability of bureaucratic structures seem destined to dominate the public realm, entangling the ascendency of the capitalist corporation. The utopia of mass participation is viable only in the intennittent assemblies of pri- 184</page><page sequence="15">equality regimentation OR comrnunity liberty ethnocentrism elite Figure 5. Triangles of rebellion and domination. vate life, where this structure supports the prevalence of religious conservatism. Lib- eralism and conservatism alike appear to be becoming little more than romanticist sentiments, moods of sporadic opposition without realistic hopes of being able to embody their aims in. a social form. This disillusioned feeling of deadlock is what appears to be distinctive to the ideo- logical situation of the late 20th century. This is what gives the sense that we are at the end of the 'modem' epoch. Received March 1992 Final version accepted May 1992 Notes ' Documentation for what follows comes largely from a chapter on 'The Secularization of the Intellectual Base' from my work in progress, The Causes of Philosophies: a Sociological The- ory of Intellectual Change. 2 By the time this appeared in 1543, the Ref- ormation had intervened, making it much more dangerous to be a scientific innovator; Catholic reactionary traditionalism grew in response to Protestant neo-traditionalism. 3 There were of course many other factors involved in the Reformation (Cameron 1991; Wuthnow 1989). The Papacy was constantly in financial difficulties, both because of its military efforts as a political power in Italy, and to some extent because of the artistic patronage at the Papal Court, which kept Michelangelo constantly in arrears of his pay. Luther mobilized resistance in Germany to the fund-raising campaigns of the sale of indulgences. This kind of financial crisis at the center and resistance to any further financial impositions by the oppositional centers is a typi- cal catalyst of state breakdown and political rev- olution, as Goldstone (1991) shows; the same holds in catalyzing religious revolutions. 4 To forestall questions of personal bias, let me go on record to say that I am not a Catholic, and was raised in the Presbyterian church. The foregoing analysis gradually dawned on me in recent years while researching the medieval and early modern period. The following argument is. documented in my 'The Weberian Revolution of the High Middle Ages' in Collins (1986) and in my work in progress, The Causes of Philosophies. In the political dimension, Catholicism has little to do with the triumph of parliamentary democracy, but neither has Protestantism. As indicated in previous paragraphs, the Catholics tended to be more concerned to limit the power of the state, while the Protestants tended to support it. But the main dynamics here are the clash of king against aristocracy and the ability of each to raise revenues from the rest of the population; the effect of the church on this aspect of modernization is rather peripheral. 6 For an attempt to demonstrate this by a comparison with the Buddhist impact on the economy of medieval China, see Collins (1990).
