<plain_text><page sequence="1">GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE' By A. N. NEWELL BETWEEN Celtic and Graeco-Roman art there existed an irrecon- cilable antagonism. Celtic art, the art of pre-Roman Gaul, was essen- tially decorative and abstract, loving geometric motifs and the stylization of living forms for purposes of ornamentation; whereas Graeco-Roman art favoured naturalism and anthropomorphism. No real synthesis of these two opposed artistic doctrines was possible; so that Gallo-Roman art, the result of an attempt at an impossible synthesis, forced upon the Celtic artist by his Roman conqueror, is, judged by a purely aesthetic criterion, a very mediocre product. Its interest, therefore, is not pri- marily aesthetic, but historically its importance is paramount; for the extant sculptures, in all their diversity and extent, throw a flood of light on the religious cults, social customs, and economic conditions of Roman Gaul. Confining ourselves to Gallo-Roman religious sculpture, our object here is to give a general survey of the iconography of peculiarly Celtic deities which survived in the Roman province, as represented in sculptures of stone and bronze. Our concern, then, is not with Celtic religion as a whole, but only with its artistic aspect in the Roman era; but even so, literary and epigraphical evidence will frequently prove illuminating in the interpretation of the works of art. We must, clearly, exclude from our scope all purely Graeco-Roman divinities imported into Gaul, together with the Oriental and Egyptian deities of the second and third centuries A.D., and the later Christian monuments. Out of this sentina numinum, this kitchen-midden of all sorts of cults, we select for discussion here only the religious imagery of Celtic divinities which sur- vived the Roman domination. But, before embarking on this venture, a brief sketch of the salient features of Celtic religion will be relevant. The religion of the Celts was a fervent nature-worship. Mountains, forests, rivers, and springs were peopled with gods and goddesses; the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Day, and Night were powerful divinities. This primitive Celtic religion, in fact, was very similar to that of the Germans who, in the time of Caesar, 'deorum numero eos solum ducunt quos cernunt et quorum aperte opibus iuvantur; Solem et Vulcanum et I The following acknowledgements are due for permission to reproduce illustrations.

But in this phase of animism and polydaemonism all these Celtic deities were anonymous and aniconic. The priesthood of the Druids alone possessed a knowledge of the gods, as Lucan expressly says: Solis nosse deos et caeli numina vobis Aut solis nescire datum, (i. 452-3.) while their ban on the anthropomorphic representation of the gods deprived the latter of plastic expression in pre-Roman Gaul. Such a prohibition is comparable with the similar phenomenon existing among the Hebrews, Persians, Moslems, and the Germans described by Tacitus; they, we are told, 'nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrantur' (Germ. ix). [Thus, pre-Roman Celtic sculpture is extremely rare in Gaul, extant examples chiefly occurring in the south of France, where the Druidic influence was counterbalanced by the influences of Graeco- Roman civilization, although the arresting Celtic relief-sculpture from Saint-Goar on the Middle Rhine is a notable exception.' Pre-Roman sculptures which have been discovered in the sanctuary of La Roqueper- tuse near VWlaux (B. du R.) include figures, squatting in a Buddhic fashion, which, as they probably represent deities, have a peculiar impor- tance for our study.] An entirely new phase, however, opened with the Roman conquest of Gaul, which was begun and completed at different periods: in I 8 B.C. the Provincia Gallia Narbonensis was formed, giving its modern name to Provence, the province par excellence; and this new territory, the semita Galliae, securing the land-route between Italy and Spain, became, as we realize from Cicero's speech Pro Fonteio, so rapidly Romanized that the elder Pliny could describe it as Italia verius quam provincia; later, between 58 and 50 B.C., the rest of Gaul was added by the dramatic conquest of Caesar. In the succeeding reorganization, the Tres Galliae of Aquitania, Lugdunensis, and Belgica were created (the Aquitania of Caesar, between the Pyrenees and Garonne, being extended under Augustus to the Loire); and by 50 A.D. Romanization was com- plete throughout the country-at least in the external aspects of its civilization. But what were the effects of the conquest on the Celtic religion? In the first place, the Druidic priesthood was suppressed as being a dangerous anti-Roman organization: and with its abolition dis- appeared the Druidic ban on religious imagery. The way was now open for the visible and material representation of the previously unsculptured deities. They became anthropomorphic, after the manner of the Graeco- I E. (= Esperandieu) viii. 6170.</page><page sequence="3">76 GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE Roman gods. Moreover, they no longer remained anonymous; inscribed dedications and ex-votos were set up in their honour, throughout Gaul, in such abundance that volumes xii (Narbonensis) and xiii (Tres Galliae) of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum have yielded the names of some one hundred and eighty Celtic divinities. But perhaps the most impor- tant result of the conquest on the religion of the Gauls was the assimila- tion of Celtic to Graeco-Roman deities both in name and in form. In name, this was achieved by appending the Celtic name of the god to that of a corresponding Roman deity, so that the Celtic became an epithet, as it were, of the Roman god, e.g. Mercurius Dumias; Apollo Grannus; Mars Leherennus, &amp;c. In form, the Celtic god assumed the outward and visible shape of his Graeco-Roman counterpart, although he frequently retained certain Celtic traits and characteristics. Assimila- tion in name had clearly already started in the time of Caesar, who had identified the principal Celtic gods with Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Assimilation inform soon followed, an early and admirable example of this process being the famous Mercury of Lezoux (Fig. i), where the Celtic god identified with Mercury has largely assumed classical form, but still retains Celtic characteristics, to which we shall return later. Thus the Romanization of Celtic religion motivated the material em- bodiment of Celtic deities; introduced inscribed dedications; and assimi- lated Celtic to Roman gods. But certain Celtic deities could not be assimilated; their counterparts were not to be found in the Graeco- Roman Pantheon. And these-the most fascinating of all-preserved intact the pristine purity of their barbaric identity, unaffected by Graeco- Roman naturalism and realism. There are, thus, two classes of Celtic deities to be considered: those, namely, who were (i) assimilated to Graeco-Roman deities, and those who remained (2) unassimilated; and in this brief survey it is possible to select only the more prominent. Let us first consider the iconography of the assimilated Celtic deities (of necessity excluding those numerous gods who, although assimilated in nomenclature, yet remained aniconic). In his excursus on Gaul (B.G. vi. 17 and 18) Caesar, after telling us (in words similar to those of Herodotus describing the Egyptians- ii. 37: OEO(UTEPES 2E TrEP1iCCO&amp;S II6vrEs lTra TrwVTrc)V v0pc'rrcov) that natio est omnis Gallorum admodum dedita religionibus, describes the Gallic religion in the following terms: Deum maxime Mercurium colunt. Huius sunt plurima simulacra, hunc omnium inventorem artium ferunt, hunc viarum atque itinerum ducem, hunc ad quaestus pecuniae mercaturasque habere vim maximam arbitrantur.

Galli se omnes ab Dite patre prognatos praedicant, idque ab Druidibus proditum dicunt. Caesar here tells us that the five principal Celtic deities were Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, Minerva; and that the divine ancestor of the Celts was Dis Pater; but it is clear that he has merely assimilated and identified with these Roman deities those gods of the Gauls whose func- tions corresponded with theirs: we have here, in fact, an excellent example of interpretatio Romana (Tac. Germ. 43)- We might add, in confirmation of the importance of these deities in Gaul, that an interesting inscription from Rome records the names of Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, together with Diana and Hercules as the Dei sancti Patrienses ex provincia Belgica (Ann. dpigr. 1894, No. 18). Of these five national, or Pan-Celtic, deities, who were thus assimilated to Roman gods, the repre- sentations of Apollo, Mars, Minerva exhibit nothing peculiarly Celtic, but let us study the iconography of the Celtic Mercury and Jupiter, and observe the Celtic characteristics they retain in their new guise. Mercury, according to Caesar, was the greatest of the Celtic gods: deum maxime Mercurium colunt, as, so Tacitus tells us in identical words, he was also the greatest of the gods worshipped by the Germans (Germ. ix); and of him there existed the greatest number of images-plurima simulacra. But in pre-Roman Gaul these simulacra were only rough- hewn pillars, analogous to the primitive 06cxvca of the Greeks, like those in the sacred grove of Massilia, described by Lucan (iii. 412-13): simulacraque maesta deorum Arte carent, caesisque extant informia truncis. This predominance of Mercury in Gaul has been confirmed by archaeo- logy: the Gallo-Roman images of this deity abound. The non-classical traits, apart from Celtic epithets, which betray the indigenous deity in his new guise, are the following: (i) He is bearded; e.g. the Mercury of Lezoux (Fig. i). This statue, 4? ft. high, now at St. Germain-en-Laye, shows the Celtic Mercury crude, stiff, ugly, old, and bearded, clad in tunic and breeches, wearing the petasos, carrying the purse and caduceus, and accompanied by a cock and goat. A very different being from the young, naked, swift messenger of the Olympians! The bearded Mercury, still holding his symbolical purse, is again seen in the splendid sculptured group from N6ris (Fig. 2), which introduces us to still further characteristics of the Celtic god: (2) He is accompanied by the nymph Rosmerta or by some other Celtic</page><page sequence="6">78 GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE goddess (e.g. Fig. 2; and cf. the Romano-British bas-relief at Gloucester, illustrated by Haverfield, Romanization of Roman Britain, Fig. 27). (3) He holds the ram-headed serpent 'le serpent " tate de bdlier' (Fig. 2). (4) He is seated (Fig. 2) (perhaps in imitation of the colossal bronze statue of Mercurius Dumias or Arvernus made for the temple of Mercury on the Puy-de-D6me by Zenodorus in the time of Nero (Pliny, N.H. xxxiv. 45). The bearded Mercury, again accompanied by the 'serpent a tete de bdlier'-one of the most curious beings in the Celtic Pantheon, to which we shall revert later, is also seen on the altar of Beauvais (E. v. 3919). Lastly, it is possible that the Celtic Mercury was represented with wings, if the interpretation given by the late Salomon Reinach of the celebrated Altar of Mavilly in the C6te-d'Or is justified. The Mavilly altar (E. iii. 2067) presents twelve figures sculptured in relief on its two blocks. The interpretation of four at least of these figures-Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan, Mars-is certain, but the rest remain obscure. Are they the twelve Di Consentes' represented in an archaic style, and is Mercury seen here with wings? (S. Reinach, Cultes, mythes, et religions, iii, pp. 191-222). Of the Celtic Jupiter there exist two types, both extremely interesting. There is first the 'Dieu " la roue', an admirable example being the bronze statuette (Fig. 3) found in 1774 at Le Chitelet (Haute-Marne), and now at St. Germain-en-Laye. The god stands holding the thunderbolt in his raised right hand, in his lowered left a six-spoked wheel, while over his right shoulder is suspended a brass ring holding nine S-shaped spirals of bronze. The wheel is a solar symbol, and the S-spirals, clearly emblematic of some divine power, possibly are also of solar significance, as W. Deonna holds. The statuette, in fact, represents the Celtic solar Jupiter, an identification which is confirmed by another bronze statuette of the 'Dieu ' la roue' at St. Germain which bears the inscription I(ovi) O(ptimo) M(aximo). The solar wheel is also carried occasionally by the other Celtic em- bodiment of the Sky-god, the 'Dieu-Cavalier a l'anguipede'. It is now generally agreed that the groups, which are so prevalent in the east of Gaul and the Rhineland, of a rider mounted on a horse, and either trampling underfoot or, borne aloft by a snake-limbed giant (e.g. Portieux, Fig. 4), represent not a Roman Emperor triumphing over barbarians, symbolized by a gigantomachy, but rather the Celtic solar Jupiter, the god of Light, victorious over the powers of Darkness personified in the serpentine I Juno Vesta Minerva Ceres Diana Venus Mars Mercurius Jovis Neptunus Vulcanus Apollo.

These groups, alternating with statues of Jupiter seated or stand- ing, surmounted the 'Jupiter and Giant Columns' of east Gaul and the Rhineland, which were erected, after the reign of Marcus Aurelius, during the revival, in eastern Gaul and the Germanies, of pre-existing solar and astral cults-a revival due to the influence of Oriental religions. The cosmogonical significance of these columns, descendants of the primitive solis columna (Festus Avienus 646), is further attested by the presence, on the octagonal base, of the planetary deities of the Week- Apollo, Diana, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn. These deities of the Week recur on the terra-cotta vases made in Belgium at this time, but no longer in classical guise; on these vases they are purely indigenous gods, whom we shall meet again. The iconography, then, of the Celtic Mercury and the Celtic Jupiter makes it clear that they were conceived of differently from their Graeco- Roman equivalents. Whether the Dis Pater of Caesar, the divine ancestor of the Celts, is represented in the numerous bronzes and bas-reliefs that portray, e.g. at Premeaux (C6te-d'Or) (Fig. 5), a bearded god, standing clad in a close-fitting star-spangled jerkin, perhaps the Gallic caracalla, and breeches, holding in his right hand an olla and in his left a long-handled mallet, cannot here be discussed. But whether he be Dis Pater or not, the 'Dieu au Maillet' was certainly assimilated to Silvanus in the valley of the Rh6ne, although, in Belgica and the Two Germanies, we find him represented with his own indigenous title, appearing as Sucellus 'le bon frappeur' together with his charming consort Nantosvelta. Lastly, it should be added that in the British Museum are to be seen four bronze statuettes of the Gallo-Roman 'Dieu au Maillet'.1 Of the deities mentioned by Caesar we have discussed the artistic aspect of the Celtic Mercury, Jupiter, and Dis Pater, but before entering upon the subject of the even more fascinating Celtic gods who remained barbarously unassimilated, let us briefly notice the Celtic Diana and Hercules. One of the most delightful bronze statuettes at St. Germain- en-Laye is that of the Celtic goddess, perhaps Arduinna, 'deesse fores- tibre des Ardennes', assimilated to Diana. She is seen seated to the right on a running boar in the attitude customary, not only to the horse- goddess Epona, but to all mortal ladies of antiquity. The Celtic Hercules was called Ogmios, and in the description of him by Lucian (Hercules) we see the image of an old man in the last infirmity of age, completely bald except for a few white hairs, wrinkled and sun- I The unique bronze Sucellus of Visp (Geneva Museum) is illustrated in F.

From his tongue proceed chains of gold which are attached to the ears of a crowd of followers, for Hercules- Ogmios was the god of eloquence, and conquered men, not by physical force, but by reason. He is very probably represented in a bronze statuette at St. Germain.' Thus the Celtic Hercules, like the Egyptian Hercules described by Herodotus (ii. 43), is a very different conception from the Hercules of Greece and Rome. The second type of Celtic deities in Roman Gaul, those, namely, who remained unassimilated to Graeco-Roman gods, and preserved intact their Gallic individuality, cannot perhaps be more significantly intro- duced than by recalling the pre-Roman Celtic sculpture found in Provence, showing a figure, possibly divine, squatting in Buddhic fashion (E. i. I31). For one of the most curious of all Celtic deities is the 'Dieu accroupi', seated cross-legged like the Buddha. He is seen, in intimate association with Mercury and Apollo, on the famous Altar of Reims (Fig. 6), a monument which admirably symbolizes the harmonious co- existence of the Celtic and Classical Pantheons. This cross-legged god, moreover, is very frequently represented with horns-or rather, with antlers-branching from his head (see traces, Fig. 6), to which char- acteristic the inscription CERNUNNOS ('the horned one') above his head on an altar in Paris clearly alludes (E. iv. 3133). Horns or antlers are also given to the celebrated three-headed or three-faced god of Gaul-the 'Dieu triciphale' (missing at Condat, Fig. 7)-as on the Gallo-Belgic vase in the Cabinet des Medailles, Paris. On this famous vase, found at Bavai or Mons, are represented the seven indigenous deities of the Week, whom we mentioned above in connexion with the 'Dieu-cavalier a l'anguip de', and amongst them is the tricephalic god, horned. The tricephal is found also in Roman Britain, and may be seen on a sculp- tured and inscribed monument found at Risingham, north of Hadrian's Wall, and now preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.z This monument, however, was erected by the 'cohors quarta Gallorum equitata' and therefore probably represents not a Romano-British but a Gallo-Roman cult. We have so far observed that both the cross-legged and the three-headed deity are represented with horns, but we have not as yet encountered a combination of tricephaly with Buddhic posture. One example exists (Fig. 8). The absence of this combination elsewhere is almost certainly due to the mutilated and incomplete state of many of these monuments, sometimes the one trait, sometimes only the other being distinguishable; but frequently, as we have seen, the combination I S.

Bronze statuette of Autun</page><page sequence="11">GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE 81 was clearly never intended. The one example extant is the famous bronze statuette (Fig. 8) found near Autun in I840, and now at St. Germain-en-Laye, which not only combines these three characteristics -Buddhic attitude, tricephaly, and horns-but manifests additional peculiarities. We see (Fig. 8) a bearded god seated 'les jambes croisdes' on a chequered cushion, reposing on a pedestal. His attitude is one of rigid hieratic frontality. He holds before him on his knees two ram- headed serpents which encircle his waist and are fish-tailed. On his neck he wears a torque, and a bracelet on his right hand. Another torque, placed between the heads of the two serpents, has the appearance of a sacred object. On either side of the head of the god are attached two much smaller heads, just above his ears (not evident in the illustration), thus creating a tricephal, while on the back of his head are two small holes into which the horns of the god, which have disappeared, were inserted. We have, therefore, united in this one deity characteristics and attributes which appear elsewhere separately, or in partial combination. From this representation, then, it is clear that all the cross-legged and tricephalic images of Gaul manifest not different deities, but one and the same deity; that while they are only partial manifestations of the god- head, his supreme avatar is embodied in the statuette of Autun. Such a very complex deity has given rise to considerable discussion, especially after the monograph of Alexandre Bertrand, 'L'Autel de Saintes et les triades gauloises' (Revue archdologique, I88o), and perhaps a brief elucidation of his various characteristics may here be profitably attempted. In the first place, what is the origin of the cross-legged posture? Is it indeed 'Buddhic' ? Or Egyptian; in imitation of Imhotep? Or is it peculiarly Celtic? Strabo (iv. 3) and Diodorus (v. 28) both tell us that the Gauls used no chairs, but sat on the ground, a custom which almost enforces a squatting attitude; let us then conclude that our tri- cephal adopted a custom that was Celtic, and did not borrow from foreign deities. The torque need not detain us long; it was, according to Salo- mon Reinach, exclusively an attribute of deities in Roman Gaul. The antlers, however, of the tricephal raise a fundamental issue, and deserve fuller treatment. They are a relic of the time when the god was himself worshipped under the form of a deer, and are a witness to the fact that zoolatry, or animal-worship, was a notable feature of primitive Celtic religion. Gallic deities in Roman Gaul were in various stages of transi- tion from purely theriomorphic to fully anthropomorphic gods; some, like the tricephal, never achieved full anthropomorphism, and were unable to discard completely all traces of their previous zoomorphic phase; and hence the stag's antlers which survive as attributes. Similarly, G</page><page sequence="12">82 GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE on the Altar of Reims (Fig. 6), the bull and deer in the front of the god also betray the primitive animal cult: they, too, have descended to the level of mere attributes. That the bull was worshipped in Gaul is attested, moreover, by the existence of bronze statuettes of a bull with three horns (a distinctive trait which is eloquent evidence of its divine character),' and by the famous Paris altar showing a bull carrying three cranes on its back, with the inscription TARVOS TRIGARANUS-the bull with the three cranes (E. iv. 3134). Further survivals of the primitive worship of animals in Gaul are to be seen in the bear-goddess, Artio; the boar-goddess, Arduinna; and the horse-goddess, Epona.z The fundamental question, 'Does zoolatry imply totemism (with its peculiar forms of social organization)?' is thus answered by Salomon Reinach: 'On se persuade facilement que la zool^itrie, sous quelque forme qu'elle se presente, n'est intelligible qu'en tant que survivance d'un tot6misme primitif et qu'il est l6gitime de conclure de l'une a l'autre'; a thesis which is contested by J. Toutain in his tbtudes de mythologie. To return to the tricephal of Autun: he holds between his arms two ram-headed serpents. The bearded Mercury of Ndris (Fig. 2) holds another; the phenomenon appears again with the bearded Mercury of Beauvais (E. v. 3919); and again in company with the Di Consentes (?) of the altar of Mavilly (E. iii. 2067). Who or what is this extraordinary being? While no conclusive answer can be given, the conjecture that the 'serpent ' tate de belier' is a personification of chthonian fecundity, a symbol of the creative power of the earth, can be strongly supported and is widely entertained. We know that the ram and serpents (twined round the caduceus) are constant attributes of the classical Mercury, and in connexion with this it is interesting to note the deduction to be drawn from the following facts: (i) The Autun tricephal (Fig. 8) holds a ram- headed serpent. (2) The Ndris Mercury (Fig. 2) also holds a ram- headed serpent. (3) The tricephal of the Musee Carnavalet, Paris (E. iv. 3137), is represented with the attributes of Mercury: he holds in his left hand a ram's head and is accompanied by a goat to the right. (4) The bronze statuette of Touget (S. Reinach, R'p. Stat. ii, p. 171) shows Mercury seated cross-legged on a chequered cushion in the attitude of the Autun tricephal. Such a mutual exchange of attributes between Mercury and the tricephal points only to one conclusion: the close con- nexion, if not indeed the identification, of the tricephal with Mercury. I Cf. the excellent Romano-British bronze statuette of a three-horned bull found at Stoke Abbot (S. Reinach, Rep. Stat. iii, p. 214). 2 See the bronze group of Epona with two foals (found in Wiltshire) now in the British Museum (Room of Roman Britain).</page><page sequence="13">GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE 83 The nature of this relation is somewhat clarified, first, when we realize that the purse is one of the most distinctive attributes of Mercury, and secondly, that the cross-legged and horned god (i.e. the same god as the tricephal) is represented on the Altar of Reims (Fig. 6) seated, between Mercury and Apollo, holding a large sack on his left arm, and with his right drawing from it grains or nuts which pour down in a stream for the bull and deer below to consume. The significance of the sack is similar to that of the cornucopia; it is a symbol of abundance: and on the well-known altar of Saintes (E. ii. 1319) the cross-legged deity, holding a purse, is accompanied by a goddess who carries a cornucopia. The statue of Sommerecourt (E. vi. 4831) shows us the same goddess of abundance seated with a cornucopia, and, encircling her body, the beneficent chthonian ram-headed serpent, the attribute of the tricephal. Thus, there can be no uncertainty about the character of the tricephal or cross-legged deity: he is a god of prosperity, abundance, and richness, just as Mercury (inventorem omnium artium) is a deity of material well-being. On the altar of Reims (Fig. 6) he appears as a protector of both wild and domestic animals and a guardian of crops, a role which is confirmed by the presence of Apollo; for here this deity, as the field-mouse in the pedi- ment clearly indicates, is none other than Apollo Smintheus, 'destroyer of field-mice' (aliveos = field-mouse) and so preserver of crops; possibly he is also Apollo AnKaos, guardian of flocks and herds. Finally, the very interesting reliefs from Santosse (E. iii. 2043) and Titelberg (E. v. 4195) may be said to confirm this benevolent aspect of the Celtic deity. Alexandre Bertrand regarded the tricephal as a 'modification abregde des triades', a symbolic simplification of a divine trinity, a theory accepted by J. Toutain. In these triads or trinities, of which the best example is certainly that now at Reims (Fig. 6), the tricephal or cross- legged deity is found associated with two other gods, where the ideas symbolized by the group are generally an elaboration of the character of the 'Dieu accroupi tricephale', i.e. material prosperity and richness. The existence of these divine triads recalls to mind the well-known verses of Lucan referring to Teutates, Esus, Taranis: Et quibus immitis placatur sanguine diro Teutates, horrensque feris altaribus Esus, Et Taranis Scythicae non mitior ara Dianae. (i. 444-6.) The questions raised by these lines are manifold: are Teutates, Esus, and Taranis the national deities of the Celts-a Pan-Celtic Trinity? Or are they merely local gods ? Are they three gods or three aspects of one god? Is Teutates, as the etymology of his name suggests (Teut = national), the sovereign god of Gaul ? Was he identified with Mercury</page><page sequence="14">84 GALLO-ROMAN RELIGIOUS SCULPTURE or with Mars? Or with both, in his cultural and bellicose aspect re- spectively? And lastly, is he the same as the Dis Pater of Caesar? But such problems can only be stated; they are too complex for solution here. As Celtic gods were very frequently accompanied by companion- goddesses, e.g. at N6ris (Fig. 2), it is not surprising to discover that the complex deity we have just been considering is likewise gladdened by a divine consort. She too is a goddess of abundance, as is clear from a rare and delightful bronze statuette in the Room of Roman Britain at the British Museum which presents the goddess antlered and seated cross-legged bear- ing a patera and cornucopia (S. Reinach, Rdp. Stat. iii, p. 79); the bronze of C6bazat (Puy-de-D6me) (Courcelle-Seneuil, Les Dieux gaulois, pl. X) shows her as a tricephal; while in the statue of Sommerecourt at Iepinal (E. vi. 4831) we see her holding a ram-headed serpent. She is thus an exact feminine counterpart of the many-sided deity of Autun (Fig. 8). In this essay we have now discussed briefly the two types of Celtic deities represented in Gallo-Roman religious sculpture, namely (i) those assimi- lated to Graeco-Roman gods, e.g. the Celtic Mercury, Jupiter, and Dis Pater, who, however, preserved certain characteristics betraying their in- digenous nature, and (2) those who, remaining unassimilated, retained their Celtic individuality unimpaired, e.g. the complex deity of Autun (Fig. 8). In drawing this survey to a conclusion there can be no more effective climax than a consideration, however brief, of the wonderful silver vase or cauldron of Gundestrup, which was found in 1891 in a peat-bog in the north of Jutland; is now in the Museum of Copenhagen; and may be seen together with the vase in the Cabinet des Medailles, mentioned previously, fully illustrated in the Revue des ttudes anciennes, vol. x (19o8). The silver vase of Gundestrup is a r6sume of practically the whole range of Celtic mythology. It may, from one aspect, be compared with the vase just referred to, as it, also, shows on its seven exterior plaques the planetary deities of the Week, while prominent among its numerous and fabulous animals, accompanied by his sacred stag, we observe the cross-legged divinity, antlered, holding a ram-headed ser- pent, and wearing and carrying a torque (Fig. 9).
