<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID GOLDBLATT The Dislocation of the Architectural Self Work in philosophy-as often in architecture-is in reality rather work on oneself. -Wittgenstein They often call me Speedo, But my real name is Mr. Earl. -From Speedo by the Cadillacs The child when it appears is a countless crowd, which life reduces soon enough to a single individual. -From Eupalinos, or the Architect, Paul Valery Enjoying a mild rejuvenation on the contempo- rary American drug scene, our word 'ecstacy,' like the English words 'derange' and 'delirium,' has its history in spatial terms. The Greek ec- stasis meaning to put outside, to put out of place, led to the notion of being besides oneself, of being transported. i In moral theory (I have Kant in mind) the idea of acting against ourselves is often seen as imperative and the problem of dis- tancing, if not removing ourselves from our pas- sions and other inclinations, is compounded by our own questionable ability to recognize just when we have succeeded. In art, too, ecstasis has had its own place, especially as the self encoun- ters itself as quotidian being. In this paper I will discuss what I believe is the role of ecstasis in recent architectural practice, specifically in the work of the American architect Peter Eisenman. Peter Eisenman's architecture recognizes and reflects a paradox regarding the architectural self: that the architect creates institutions-e.g., the home, the city, but as an inventive force- must also resist the very process of institution- alizing these very commissioned projects. As Eisenman puts it, "In order to be, it must always resist being. ... This is the paradox of architec- ture. Thus, in order to reinvent a site ... the idea of site must be freed from its traditional places, histories, and systems of meaning. This involves the dislocation of the traditional interpretation of its elements."2 Eisenman's work constitutes an architecture that is somehow removed from an unreinvented architectural milieu, one requiring an architect who will break with architecture's own hierarchical presuppositions. Under these provisional assumptions rests a deeper difficulty: breaking with such presup- positions cannot simply be a matter of the archi- tect's choosing to do so. The architect is coimpli- cated in the tradition of architecture, through schooling, apprenticeship and professional re- ward as well as by the usual devices of encultura- tion. The architect comes to understand and to re- spect architecture as traditionally conceived. And since architecture qua artform is also inextricably meshed with everyday life, the impact of culture is also an everyday, ingraining phenomenon. Some, like Alan Colquhoun, appreciate at least part of the negotiated condition of architecture, if only as a matter of degrees of distinction from other arts: "With architecture so bound to the sources of finance and power, it is much more difficult for the architect than for other artists to operate within an apparently autonomous sub- culture or to retain independence from bourgeois taste that has been the ambition of art since the early nineteenth century."3 To name oneself as architect is to pose within the context of a tradi- tion, one constituted by expectations, privileges and obligations. I am calling the self that works within the context of a traditional architecture, an architecture of everyday practice, "the architec- tural self." By definition, the architectural self does not feel the force of Eisenman's paradox. Eisenman's concern is not so much about whether good or interesting work can be produced within architecture's traditional presuppositions; rather, he is skeptical about whether a more "specula- tive," exploratory architecture, an architecture that investigates it own assumptions, can be de- signed by a self whose work is an expression of traditional tastes, beliefs and principles. On the basis of Eisenman's understanding of the architects' situation, the architect ought to attempt to employ a strategy that removes that aspect of the coimplicated self from their The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 49:4 Fall 1991</page><page sequence="2">338 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism architecture. It is a matter of the self's not being able to trust the self, in the manner of Kant's heteronymous will being an unreliable trustee for the moral restraint upon desire. Part of the problem, Eisenman has come to suspect, is that there may be "a powerful anthropomorphism operating at the level of the unconscious wish " in entrenched architectural practice. As Jeffrey Kipnis has put it, "Architecture in the service of institution is architecture in the service of man as he wants to see himself and to continue seeing himself. As such, it is a denial of architecture as a, perhaps the, vehicle of becoming."4 An archi- tectural process that does not privilege those features that assume "man" as the measure of all things architectural may be a way of revealing what the architecture of tradition and the tra- ditional self have repressed, it may be a way, in Derrida's phrase, of "letting other voices speak. "5 A strategy is needed to remove the architect as a source of resistance to non-tradi- tional architecture so that design can begin from a dislocated vantage point. I would like to con- sider one strategy Eisenman employs to achieve this dislocation-the use of a series of architec- tural moves that center on the notion of "arbi- trary text." Eisenman uses the arbitrary text in order to initiate design subsequent to the inter- ruption of the self's usual propensities while doing architecture. In the course of analyzing what ought to hap- pen to the self of the architect in the context of this strategy, I will also look at the Nietzsche of The Birth of Tragedy and some neglected but provocative ideas from the final chapter of Arthur Danto's The Transfiguration of the Common- place. Danto, Nietzsche and Eisenman discuss the dislocation of some version of a common- place self uprooted by a mechanism analytically related to art, with the result in each case being some extraordinary self-situation. For Danto and Eisenman the dislocation takes place by means of an "outside" text and can be attributed to some metaphorical aspect of it. Although Danto gives the commonplace/extraordinary di- chotomy a central place in his analysis, I want to show that that distinction only instantiates selves that are substantially different from each other. Danto's dislocation is the result of an arbitrary intersection of one "life" metaphorically brought to bear upon some status quo self, e.g., a reader of texts, ordinary or not. Peter Eisenman, on the other hand, seeks the arbitrary in his architec- ture in order to dislocate the coimplicated self of the traditional architect by virtue of the kind of metaphorical structure recognized by Danto, a metaphorical structure which, in its limiting and most arbitrary case, is catachresis. The early Nietzsche, like Eisenman, is interested in shak- ing off the anthrocentric in order to latch onto a power repressed by an externalized quotidian life, a power, according to Nietzsche, internally related to the self of the artist. But first some background and a characterization of the prob- lem at hand must be given. In the summer of 1988 New York's Museum of Modern Art hosted an exhibit called, "Decon- structivist Architecture." "Deconstructivist Ar- chitecture" was curated by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley in Johnson's first major museum project since his 1932 landmark show that intro- duced the International Style to America. The new exhibit intended to group together seven important architects that by some stretch of the imagination could be called "deconstructivists." (Not merely a variation of "deconstructionist," the term indicates the art born in pre-revolution- ary Russia, since they commonly challenged some of the more central traditional aspects of architecture like unity, stability, harmony, com- fort and function.) Deconstruction in architec- ture has come to be seen as a vital response to the historically necessary, but much more facile, architectural postmodernism as well as to a broadly construed notion of classical/modern architecture. But it must be kept in mind that far from being the name of an architectural move- ment or school, 'deconstructivism' refers at best to the practices of a loose set of diverse members many of whom would justifiably resist that or any other label. Peter Eisenman, one of two Americans in the MOMA show (the other was Frank Gehry), is no exception. As an example of an attempt to deny the priv- ileging of one or more of the traditional aspects of architecture consider an Eisenman project, his award-winning Guardiola House. Proposed for a site high above the Atlantic on the Spanish Costa de la Luz near Cadiz, it is a startling but also beautiful weekend residence for a single father and his grown son. It has windows in the floor</page><page sequence="3">Goldblatt The Dislocation of the Architectural Self 339 and floors that are unlevel. It is sometimes neces- sary to go outside to get into another room and the house itself is split by an exterior stairway rising from the sea. The Guardiola House appears frag- mented, if not tortured and shaky. According to Eisenman, the Guardiola design researches the meaning of place or topos as part of "the breakdown of the traditional forms of place," and results in something "between place and object, between container and contained." This "simultaneity of two traditionally contra- dictory states" is to be found in the Timaeus in Plato's definition of the receptacle (chora), which is, roughly, like a holding place for office (as in political office) but does not exist as a sensible or even intelligible thing itself. Derrida has recently written an essay entitled "Chora," and Eisenman's "research" here exemplifies the usual Derridian breakdown of binary opposi- tions which Eisenman sometimes expresses as betweeness. Working between can be charac- terized as suspending the privilege of one mem- ber of a binary opposition at the expense or the devaluation of another. (Eisenman, whose archi- tecture has put into use a network of concepts taken from the writings of Jacques Derrida, has collaborated with Derrida on the design of a garden in Bernard Tschumi's Parc de la Villette in Paris, 1985.) The contemporary philosoph- ical critique of foundational binary oppositions by postmodern thinkers following the lead of Heidegger or Derrida has been given an archi- tectural context by Eisenman: "Traditional op- position between structure and decoration, ab- straction and figuration, figure and ground, form and function could be dissolved. Architecture could begin an exploration of the 'between' with- in these categories."6 Eisenman's Wexner Cen- ter for the Visual Arts at the Ohio State Univer- sity in Columbus, explores the betweeness of architectural binary opposition. For example, the 516 foot-long, white, uncovered, three-di- mensional grid, running almost the entire length of the site, at full-building scale, as "scaffold- ing" (the temporary, tentative construction ap- paratus) that remains prominently and perma- nently there after the structure is completed, falls somewhere between process and product, past and present, shelter and non-shelter, struc- ture and form, structure and ornament, building and non-building, exterior and interior. (More on Wexner later.) Although Eisenman's projects tend to look significantly different from other architectures, Eisenman neither aims at avant-gardism nor di- rects his projects towards the manipulation of forms or towards works that please aesthetically. Architecture, according to Eisenman, has the potential to join other artists in a deep explora- tion of meaning. In the unconcealing or opening of meanings that are often hidden beneath a commonplace traditional surface or among the relationships between traditional objects, that which is not laid bare is often if not always that which is repressed by traditional forms of mean- ing. An architecture that is not merely emblem- atic of status quo interests or desires, one that can "let other voices speak," is as capable of engaging in the same tensions between tradition and innovation as painting or literature. A non- traditional architecture can "surgically open up the Classical and the Modern to find what is repressed."7 Indeed for Eisenman the differences between classical and modern architecture are insignifi- cant; in fact, Eisenman often thinks of modern- ism as merely another form of classicism. Tradi- tional architecture, then, will include the work of modernists such as Mies, Corbusier and Loos, despite their reputation to the contrary. Eisen- man is clear on the reduction of the modern to the classical tradition: In trying to reduce architectural form to its essence, to a pure reality, the moderns assumed they were transforming the field of referential figuration to that of non-referential 'objectivity.' In reality, however, their 'objective' forms never left the classical tradi- tion. They were simply stripped down classical forms, or forms referring to a new set of givens (function, technology). Thus Corbusier's houses that look like modern steamships or biplanes exhibit the same refer- ential attitude toward representation as a Renaissance or "classical" building.8 Eisenman's dislocation from the traditional ar- chitectural self in such projects as the Wexner Center, includes dislocation from the self that works in the mode of modern architecture which Eisenman sees as significantly classical even in the period of its inception. On his view, dif- ferences between the classic and the modern do not run deep. According to Eisenman, then, the metaphysical presuppositions of architecture,</page><page sequence="4">340 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism architectural essence as traditionally conceived, are the same for modernism as they are for classicism. The Wexner Center and the Guardiola House instantiate one general problem facing Eisen- man: how to make architecture that is unhier- archical, that avoids the "powerful anthrocen- trism" mentioned above. Such an architecture would refuse to acknowledge the stability of the concept of architecture which is buttressed by a grounding metaphysics of essentiality and which, in turn, allows for the appearance of the timeless self-evidence of architecture's "essential" fea- tures. "Deconstruction," Derrida has said, "is first and foremost a suspicion directed against just that kind of thinking-'what is ... ?' 'what is the essence of?' "9 The seeming self-evidence of such features constitute what Kipnis has called, "a resistance, a received value-structure by which architecture is repressed."' 0 Eisenman's aim is to refuse the privileged status of these anthrocentric features-to deny their centrality, their favored position in the praxis of design. But this task is only compounded by the situa- tion of the self when the self is making architec- ture. The traditional architectural self is inclined not only to celebrate and express the anthro- centric essentials of traditional architecture but also to make architecture that looks and feels like traditional architecture, i.e., to be pleased and feel perceptually and emotionally satisfied by what is "designed." The problem at hand is not to be underestimated. If the quotidian architectural self is itself sus- pect, it will not do to express that self that makes design merely a matter of taste or preference. "A major displacement," Eisenman says, "concerns the role of the architect/designer and the design process. Something may be designed which can be called displacing, but it may be only an ex- pressionism, a mannerist distortion of an essen- tially stable language. It may not displace the stable language, but on the contrary further sta- bilize its normative condition. This can be seen in many examples of current architectural fash- ion. There is a need for process other than an intuition- 'I like this,' or 'I like that.' When the process is intuitive it will already be known, and therefore complicit with the repressions inherent in architectural 'knowledge.' "1 1 Architects, then, like to "design," to make buildings that are visually pleasing, to join and further entrench the history of architecture: to make "architec- ture." Derrida says, "Let us never forget that there is an architecture of architecture. Down even to its archaic foundation, the most funda- mental concept of architecture has been con- structed. " He continues: This architecture of architecture has a history, it is historical through and through. Its heritage inaugu- rates the intimacy of our economy, the law of our hearth (oikos), our familial, religious and political 'oikonomy,' all the places of birth and death, temple, school, stadium, agora, square, sepulchre. It goes right through us (nous transit) to the point that we forget its very historicity: we take it for nature. It is common sense itself. 12 According to Derrida then, the commonsensi- cality of a certain metaphysics of architecture has come to present itself as architecture itself masking the correct view that the concept of architecture is itself a construct. Once this is understood it is possible, if not yet practical, for the architect to question stability and to explore and initiate other architectures. But practical autonomy in architecture requires something else. "Autonomy ... depends," Eisenman says in his Houses of Cards, "on distancing both the architect from the design process and the object from a traditional history." 13 But since the archi- tect is already co-implicated, perhaps as an un- witting party to the process of design, it cannot simply be a matter of choosing to do so. The issue of distancing oneself from the process of architecture is the problem of distancing oneself from oneself, the issue of ecstasis. II It is part of my purpose in presenting ecstatic themes in Nietzsche and Danto to undercut re- sistance to utilizing so dramatic a concept as ecstasis by citing precedents in aesthetical- theoretical contexts other than the one I am ren- dering for Eisenman. Although I hope to iden- tify certain similarities among these views I am in no way claiming that ecstasis functions identi- cally in each different circumstance in which it is invoked. Indeed, I have hoped to emphasize just how differently ecstasis is used by Nietz- sche and Danto and how Peter Eisenman's use of</page><page sequence="5">Goldblatt The Dislocation of the Architectural Self 341 this notion is distinct from either of them. (I have summarized some of these differences above.) In what follows I would like to emphasize that the role of ecstasis in Nietzsche's Birth of Trag- edy has been correctly understood as a critical response to the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- tury construct "Classical Greece" in which the Greek character is represented as one of noble simplicity and serene greatness. There, accord- ing to Winckelmann, "the expression in Greek figures reveals greatness and composure of soul in the throes of whatever passions." By contrast Nietzsche's first book emphasizes the centrality of the Dionysian in Greek life, manifested para- digmatically in Bacchian ritual, and character- ized by the kind of frenzy and intoxication that the Germanic Greece sought to repress. Out of such rites came "a complete sexual promiscuity overriding every form of established tribal law; (where) all the savage urges of the mind were unleashed." Nietzsche locates precedents of dramatic tragedy in what he calls "the Diony- sian ecstatic artist." 14 Architecture is an unlikely candidate for the Dionysian "vortex." Greek architecture, for Nietzsche, especially the Doric, stood in the foreground of the Apollonian representation of austerity and control, which Nietzsche saw as necessary but far from sufficient for tragedy, that dramatic form which takes as its theme the ultimate destruction of an individual. "The only way I am able to view Doric art and the Doric state is as a perpetual military encampment of the Apollonian forces. An art so defiantly aus- tere, so ringed about with fortifications-an ed- ucation so military and exacting-a polity so ruthlessly cruel-could endure only in a con- tinual state of resistance against the titanic and barbaric menace of Dionysos." 15 E.R. Dodds, in a passage cited by Silk and Stern, describes the ecstatic role of a decidedly democratic Dionysos: "Apollo moved only in the best society, aristocratic athletes; but Dio- nysus was at all periods demotikos, a god of the people ... Dionysus ... is Lusios, 'the Liber- ator'-the god who enables you for a short time to stop being yourself, and thereby sets you free. "6 This is the very advice Nietzsche offers the dramatist: "To be a dramatist all one needs is the urge to transform oneself and speak out of strange bodies and souls." 17 During the Diony- sian excitation of the Bacchic rituals, when the principium individuationis is dropped, this is precisely what happens in the dramatic chorus and constitutes for Nietzsche "the primary dra- matic phenomenon" namely, "projecting one- self outside the self and then acting as though one had really entered another body, another character ... what we have here is the individual effacing himself through entering a strange being. " 18 As anamnesis or recollection played its role for Socrates in the recapturing of knowledge, forgetting is the mechanism at work for Nietz- sche in the self's abrogation. What is negated by virtue of forgetting is "one's civic past and so- cial rank," one's everyday or commonplace self. And since in Nietzsche's unreified notion of Will, it is analytic that willing is willing towards an end, "our personal interest in purposes, " the dropping of such civil or social ends is also the negation of the will. The artist of The Birth of Tragedy is without will, replaced perhaps by impulse, in unmediated contact with some kind of primordial being or "original Oneness" and becomes identified with it. The artist becomes "exempt from the embarrassing task of copying reality." 19 "He ... strides with the same elation and ecstasy as the gods he has seen in his dreams. No longer the artist, he has himself become a work of art: the productive power of the whole universe is now manifested in his transport."20 Nothing much in this paper turns on this early romantic notion of being in direct touch with some thing-in-itself, a view Nietzsche was later to reject. Rather, the point to be emphasized here is that some self, in some manner or other, has been dislocated from the ordinary self by art. Not entirely arbitrary "this mystical un-selv- ing" is "a world sanctioned by myth and ritual" and stands in definite contrast with the com- monplace. For Nietzsche the "receptacle" in early tragedy for the intersection of artist, art- work and audience was the chorus, the chora within which those divisions were dropped. For Nietzsche, "the subjective artist is simply the bad artist ... since we demand above all, in every genre and range of art, a triumph over subjec- tivity, deliverance from the self, the silencing of every personal will and desire."'21 Art, on this early Nietzschean account, is not a matter of the expression of the traditional self, but of its re- moval.</page><page sequence="6">342 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism In this Nietzschean scenario, the emptied, formerly commonplace self becomes a recepta- cle, a placeholder, (like the chora) neither in order to enhance the will nor replace one will with another, but rather to negate it and to fill its place with former repressions. What the ecstatic self experiences is often unpalatable to the for- merly repressed civic self: the violent, the ugly, the "unnatural." Analogously, Peter Eisenman claims that in striving for the conventionally beautiful, architecture also represses the gro- tesque or confines it to the peripheries: "the grotesque was acceptable as long as it was as decoration; in the form of gargoyles, and fres- coes. This is because the grotesque introduces the idea of the ugly, the deformed, the sup- posedly unnatural as something always present in the beautiful. It is this condition of the always present or the already within, that the beautiful in architecture attempts to repress."22 The re- turn of the will following the Bacchic ritual, is the return of civic and social interests from Dionysian to quotidian reality. "But," says Nietzsche, "as soon as that quotidian reality enters consciousness once more it is viewed with loathing, and the consequence is an ascetic, abulic state of mind. "23 In broader terms, this early Nietzschean ac- count minimally recognizes that the everyday, reasonable self is significantly incomplete, and that the perfecting of the quotidian "artistic" self through traditional forms of practice only leads one further from an authentic pursuit of art. In the words of Habermas, The critique of the Western emphasis on logos in- spired by Nietzsche proceeds in a destructive manner. It demonstrates that the embodied, speaking and acting subject is not master in its own house; it draws from this the conclusion that the subject positing itself in knowledge is in fact dependent upon something prior, anonymous, and transsubjective. ... Once the defenses of subject-centered reason are razed, logos, which for so long had held together an interiority protected by power, hollow within and aggressive without, will collapse into itself. It has to be delivered over to its other, whatever that may be.24 For Nietzsche this "other" constitutes an un- qualified original, precisely the sort of entity that Derrida and Eisenman deny. But on the need for the dislocation of the traditional self in order to dissolve repressions of that traditional self they agree. III At this point I would like to consider some of Arthur Danto's ideas on the relationship be- tween the self and art, particularly good if not great art. Although Danto is concerned with the self as auditor rather than as artist, his ideas about self-identity in his chapter on "Metaphor, Expression and Style" are pertinent to what I am calling the dislocation of the self, what Danto refers to as "being taken out of oneself by art." Much has been written about Danto's consid- eration of art objects: how objects with certain well-entrenched ontologies take on new, addi- tional ontologies and correspondingly, how ob- jects with predicates of certain sorts take on new and different sets of predicates without neces- sarily abandoning the old ones. Not only Du- champian readymades have this "double citizen- ship" but all artworks which are grounded in so much "materiality," e.g., paint on canvas on frame. Indeed, more broadly, all representations are (at least) dually ontologized in this way. And lest one think that Danto's ontological consid- erations regarding perceptual indiscernibles ap- ply to artworld concerns alone, one need but think of the grand pairs of look-the-sames per- vading the history of philosophy: the waking experience and the dream, a deterministic world and a world of accidents, a world in which God exists and one in which God is absent, language and scribble, persons and bodies. For Danto, the initial task of philosophy has been to explain such differences if differences do not lie in per- ception alone. Towards the end of The Transfiguration of the Commonplace Danto turns his attention away from the transfiguration of objects to the trans- figuration of selves. Here he presents a pro- vocative thesis about what happens to auditors and spectators of artworks in the course of being engaged with them. Parallel to his account of transfigured objects, Danto's account is an ex- planation of how selves take on new art-relevant identities, while somehow retaining their old ones, in a way that is both temporary and un- commonplace. The "spectator," Danto says, "identifies himself with the represented char- acter: and sees his or her life in terms of the</page><page sequence="7">Goldblatt The Dislocation of the Architectural Self 343 depicted: it is oneself as Anna Karenina, or Isabelle Archer, or Elizabeth Bennett, or 0: one- self sipping limetea; in the Marabar Caves; in the waters off East Egg; in the Red Chamber ... where the artwork becomes a metaphor for life and life is transfigured."25 Here, the possibili- ties for the transfiguration of the self are closely tied to the notion of what the self believes the self to be, if only for a temporary period of time: You cannot altogether separate from your identity your beliefs about what that identity is: to believe yourself to be Anna is to be Anna for the time you believe it, to see your life as a sexual trap and yourself as a victim of duty and passion. Art, if a metaphor at times on life, entails that the not unfamiliar experi- ence of being taken out of oneself by art-the familiar artistic illusion-is virtually the enactment of a meta- phoric transformation with oneself as subject: you are what the work is ultimately about, a commonplace person transfigured into an amazing woman.26 Thus, according to Danto: If a reader R, is metaphorically transformed (transfigured) by (reading about) C, where C is a fictional char- acter, then there is a metaphor CM whose rele- vant analogical features are also features that are part of the life of C, and that by virtue of CM, R sees her life a new way, at least for the time that she "believes" those relevant analogical features to be part of her own life. On some accounts of metaphor, C just is CM, and on some accounts of belief, R's belief includes a suspending of disbelief. For Danto, the removal of self from self hap- pens by virtue of metaphor (whose Greek root, it is worth recalling, means 'to transport') with the Aristotelian notions of analogy and new per- spective (which includes belief) as part of the means. I think it is important to note, for my purposes here and in order to properly under- stand Danto's position, that the notion of "being commonplace" is logically independent of the notion of "being a candidate for transfigura- tion," although the transfiguration of a common- place object into one that is somehow uncom- monplace may be his most striking example. But there is nothing in Danto's notion of transfigura- tion that precludes the ontological transition from objects already interpreted (a necessary condition for artworks according to him) to those that also require new ones. Even inter- preted objects can be takeover targets. And for Danto, it is part of the logic of transfiguration (as opposed to transformation) that earlier iden- tities remain intact. Whether commonplace objects are really interpreted objects but so fa- miliar that we do not notice the interpretation, is another matter and one that will not concern me here. That the self transfigured through art- works is a commonplace self, humble with re- spect to the extraordinary personal circumstance waiting in artworks for the interpreter/self to pay respects, is merely a working assumption and not a necessary condition. What is relevant to Danto's scheme for the dislocation of self is difference-difference of sufficient significance that ontological identities change during the course of the reader's meta- phorical confrontation with the network of prop- erties and relationships that constitute fictional characters. The commonplace/extraordinary di- chotomy, while it brings for some a kind of worthwhileness to the enterprise of reading, is only an instantiation of this ontological differ- ential. Although Danto's own examples for an artis- tically transfigured self come from the fictional portrayal of persons, there is no difficulty in imagining that sort of transfiguration taking place by virtue of architecture-the self trans- figured by powerful buildings. For example, it is easy to imagine the native Indian transfigured into a member of the British Empire, or the private bourgeois into the patriot/citizen, or the indifferent believer into the awestruck theist and so forth, each transfiguration respectively initi- ated by the self's presence to a meaningful struc- ture. For the time being, I would like to note only that at least in the kind of literary examples Danto uses, there is a certain degree of unpre- dictability about the self's new location-that in the course of reading a novel there is a certain arbitrary abandonment of oneself to the text's protagonist in an accidental intersection and super-imposition of lives. It also seems arbitrary that at the outset of a novel, the reader is un- aware of the full future consequences of seeing the world from another perspective, even if those consequences are innocent and short-lived. IV In the wake of two decades or so of literature on the subject, Eisenman views architecture as</page><page sequence="8">344 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism textual and his own architectural strategies as textual strategies. Traditional architecture, in Eisenman's view, begins with certain traditional texts. One might say, for example, that a typical program (an account of client requirements) is a determining or relevant architectural text. So too a specific site can be "read" with respect to access to surrounding buildings or opportunity of view. The history of architecture is also a text replete with meanings. For example, what a church, home, or stadium means includes what it has looked like through the ages until the present. In addition, formal typologies, simple abstract geometrical configurations, which according to Rafael Moneo, allow for "the possibility of grouping objects by certain inherent structural similarities,' are architectural instruments that are available as architectural texts.27 The in- stantiations of formal types on actual sites in real architectural practice are usually distorted or otherwise modified so that architecture can ad- dress "both their singleness and their shared features."28 It is not obvious that there is any- thing inherently architectural in the abstracted geometricality of formal typologies. But the use of simple types of geometrical forms in the process of design has incorporated those forms textually into the history of architecture. Eisen- man sees these texts as part of traditional or, as he sometimes call it, "classical" architecture, architecture that accepts the anthropological metaphysics of architecture. The kind of "sin- gleness" or newness mentioned by Moneo, for example, leaves unscathed the foundational as- sumptions of architecture including the tradi- tional essence/accident opposition. The dislocation of the architectural self re- quires a strategy, and one such strategy includes positing a text that will bring into question those architectural assumptions. But such a text can- not be one of the traditional texts of architecture. Instead, Eisenman reaches for an outside text that, relative to some particular current project, is accidental or arbitrary. V The history of the meaning of the word 'arbi- trary' seems to have undergone a reversal of sorts with respect to the idea of the will. Once meaning 'that which was a result of the prefer- ence or will of an arbiter in contrast to being governed or determined by rule or law alone,' 'arbitrary' now seems to designate, at least in some domains, the quality of being selected by preference or impulse only but not really cho- sen, i.e., not a product of the will. The notion of an arbitrary text continues to include the idea of being generated by an arbiter, a textual arbiter which, like a law, stands outside its object of application. Such a textual arbiter may even be selected more or less at random and not itself really the product of the will of the selector. This needs certain qualification, but means that al- though the selector does not know the full conse- quences of the text for the architectural project beforehand, he or she is nevertheless willing to accept those consequences even if they violate the architect's good, traditional sense: his or her tastes or preferences or those characteristics such as function or harmony, which are tradi- tionally understood to constitute essential archi- tectural conditions. Wittgenstein said in 1931 that, "'Arbitrary' as we normally use it always has reference to some practical end: e.g. if I want to make an efficient boiler I must fulfil certain specifica- tions, but it is quite arbitrary what colour I paint it."29 Since willing in traditional architecture tends to be willing toward the constructed meta- physical essentials of entrenched architectural practice, it is possible to say that, by virtue of the arbitrary text, Eisenman, for a specified period during an architectural project, reverses the usual opposition between essence and acci- dent. A reversal of the relationship between tra- ditional architectural essence and accident does not necessarily result in the absence of a tradi- tionally essential quality, say shelter, from an architectural project any more than Wittgen- stein's boiler is uncolored. Accidents (in a dou- ble sense of that word) are incorporated into the project as practical ends, and traditional es- sences now become accidents of the project. Acting as the result of some arbitrary text helps remove the architect as a source of resistance toward establishing essential/traditional ends as privileged architectural goals including one of a pair of the sets of binary oppositions now held in suspension. The idea behind an arbitrary text in the con- text of the dislocation of the self is to remove the hands from the hands of the architect, to elimi-</page><page sequence="9">Goldblatt The Dislocation of the Architectural Self 345 nate a major motivation from a highly motivated self in order to place the self in a new position regarding its own work. By removing an ini- tiating constituent in the traditional design pro- cess the outside text diminishes, but does not eliminate, the architect's role overall in making well-entrenched architecture. The arbitrary text is a text lifted from its own home, its own context, rationale and motivation, its own tradi- tional place and utilized in some materially ap- plicable respect. In a certain sense then, the ar- bitrary text is context-free, i.e., it is free of the context of the project at hand. Eisenman has used the Derridian notion of grafting to express the transplanting of this "other" text onto a particular architectural project. It seems to me that there are at least two relevant senses in which a text can be context- free. First, a text can be free of or outside ar- chitecture as traditionally understood, i.e., a non-architectural text; and second, it can stand outside the traditional subject matter of the proj- ect at hand. Eisenman's use of DNA in his Bio- Centrum research laboratories at the J.W Goethe University, Frankfurt-am-Main is an example of the former, while his use of scaffolding for the Columbus city grid in the design for the Wexner Center comes at least close to being an example of the latter. Let me call a text that is arbitrary in both of the above senses a strongly arbitrary text and a text that is arbitrary in only one of those senses arbitrary in the weak sense. It must be said that to the best of my knowledge, Eisenman has never made use of an arbitrary text in the strong sense outside of studio exercises. 30 The arbitrary text works by the architect's choosing some materially applicable aspect of that text, by juxtaposing it to the usual texts of architecture and assigning it more or less equal influence in the final design. In a theoretically limiting case neither will dominate, and the re- sult will be the betweeness mentioned earlier. Those aspects then make their appearance in the design as "traces," fragmented signs that indi- cate but do not image the arbitrary text.3' The "architect" will also be between in a sense: between the architect coimplicated in the institu- tional history of architecture and an other if non- characterized self, dislocated but ready to work with design possibilities that intersect the imme- diate project but are accidental relative to it. The arbitrary text functions analogically, which implies that only certain of its aspects are contextually transplanted by the architect. The applied aspects of the arbitrary text may surface in the architectural project more or less obvi- ously but in any case are themselves chosen from the text by the architect. There is, then, by virtue of certain shared features, an analogical relationship between the project and the arbi- trary text. But the analogy is a peculiar one since the consequences of its use are not entirely worked out. It works, for a time at least, like a metaphor postponed. Since the analogous fea- tures of the arbitrary text, now analogue, have not yet been considered, the new insight or vi- sion essential to metaphor is incomplete or open. In the case of the strongly arbitrary text the relationship between new architectural text and arbitrary text may be uninterpretable, the con- nection not or not yet bearing the metaphorical fruit of novelty or insight. If it does not, cata- chresis takes place, i.e., an abuse of words, a misuse of words, a "forced metaphor" with the structure of metaphor but lacking in metaphor- ical illustrativeness. As the result of the imposition of a meta- phorical structure on a traditional project by virtue of an arbitrary text, catachresis generates what is traditionally inappropriate. In the prac- tice of architecture it holds before the architect a new value, a polar absence whose possibility of meaning must fall between the initial and the catachretic. Forced metaphor provides a greater "hang time" (to borrow from the sporting life) than ordinary metaphor, where familiarity and propriety lubricate the closure of the activity (the energeia) initiated by metaphoric introduc- tion. It is the tension and the possibility for play, along this detour towards and away from mean- ing, that prompt Derrida to think of catachreses as "revelation, unveiling, bringing to light, truth," and why its role is so central for philos- ophy.32 In the case of the strongly arbitrary text there is no guarantee that interesting connections or meaningful relationships will result between new architecture and outside text, although configu- rational similarities in the form of traces might prevail. Whether these similarities are mean- ingful at the time of application is out of the control of the no-longer-designing architectural self. But it is precisely this juxtaposition of en- tities that creates a tension outside the traditional</page><page sequence="10">346 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism limitations of meaning channeling thought some- where between the two. Not unlike the Apollo- nian imposition upon the Dionysian, it is in the words of Eisenman, "a controlled accident." It is metaphor without an end or goal produced by removing the self from its original pursuit of meaning and purpose. While the architect chooses the arbitrary text, the choice is made without deliberation and with- out knowingly exploiting its potentially meta- phorical features for the project. It is an act of conscious disavowal on the part of the self. So that even if the architect chooses the text by the aforementioned tastes and preferences, the arbi- trary text replaces the architect in the role of arbiter (worker). In the Wexner Center, for ex- ample, which is in part determined by two dif- ferent sets of intersecting axes (city and campus grids at 12'1/4 degree angles) a column is allowed to fall on the steps of a major stairway and a dominant enclosed form determined in part by those axes in conjunction with the three-dimen- sional use of Eisenman's permanent "scaffold- ing," has no practical function whatsoever, i.e., it is not a space in which anything happens. (Campus lingo has dubbed it "student hous- ing. ") A commitment to the arbitrary text on the part of the architect assures that traditional texts are violated. It will sometimes call for compro- mises with those traditionally essential features of architecture, such as function or shelter, even if the result will be inconvenience or discomfort (or the appearance or representation of such) to the inhabitants of the dwelling. The employment of the arbitrary text is part of a strategy to undermine the search for origin, to work with "starting points without value," as Eisenman puts it. "'Not-classical' origins," he says, "can be strictly arbitrary." Once the self-evident characteristic of architecture is dis- missed, "architecture is seen as having no a priori origins-whether functional, divine or na- tural-alternative fictions for the origin can be proposed: for example, one that is arbitrary, one that has no external values derived from mean- ing, truth or timelessness."33 When Eisenman says that the arbitrary is that without origin or value, he has not lost the strong connection with the arbitrary as accidental or unwilled. It is the traditional text that has a place or origin, a mean- ing that is presupposed by the willer who must know that use or meaning in its proper context. But the unwilled, arbitrary text is outside the tradition, is outside the language-game in which it gains its home or original use. Outside of that, it no longer has its original value, carrying only traces of its "original" or traditional meaning, its function as a sign. With apologies to Aristotle, we see, outside these points of traditional obli- gation, there is nothing but gods and beasts. And they are untrustworthy and unpredictable. With respect to the Wexner Center, the com- pleted project is itself what Eisenman calls "a non-building-an archaeological earthwork whose essential elements are scaffolding and landscaping." It instantiates his concept of be- tweeness. Fractured and looking incomplete, the project neverthelessfunctions, shelters etc., but unlike "modern" architecture, neither rep- resents, celebrates nor monumentalizes, func- tion or shelter. 34 It is a Center without a center or an obvious front or back and without some sin- gle White House-like gestalt. From one look we have no idea what the rest of it is like.35 Eisenman is perfectly comfortable with the idea that he would never want to live in one of his own houses. He is after all, a commonplace dweller, a self replete with resistance and repres- sion, a self seeking traditional comforts. But the issue here is no more one about satisfying hu- man comfort than Kant's concern about morality was the fulfillment of human desire. And while the categorical imperative is anything but arbi- trary in that it is a paradigm of logocentric enlightened thinking, it, like the arbitrary text, is outside of but applicable within the anthro- centric sphere. In any case, Eisenman's didactic place in contemporary culture should not be evaluated by what I am calling the "manifesto mentality, " a belief that in the best of all possible worlds a given kind of art would replace all other artworks. Fortunately for Eisenman there are those persons and institutions who are interested in consuming an architecture that grows out of a suspicion of Enlightenment values. For Eisen- man it is an architecture of betweeness; one that refuses to accept the "self-evidence" of the con- cept of architecture and one that explores ex- tended modes of architectural meaning. As explained at the outset, I consider this paper an outline that mentions numerous issues without always fully recognizing the problem- atic nature of those raised. Nevertheless, I hope that the breadth achieved here in drawing to-</page><page sequence="11">Goldblatt The Dislocation of the Architectural Self 347 gether a range of architecturally related items will compensate for this unavoidable omission. VI Architecture is usually not the paradigm used by philosophers when dealing with artworks. As was the case for Kant, Ruskin and Loos among others, this probably stems from architecture's role in commonplace life, its questionable status as a pure artwork, its position as hybrid. Unlike the Bacchic festivals or the novels and paintings of contemporary life, architecture in a sense is not merely aberration, a deviance from the every- day that we visit but from which we easily ex- tract ourselves. Wherever architecture is it is en- meshed in forms of life rather than juxtaposed to it. Such a condition simultaneously makes resistance to the hierarchical values of architec- ture all the more difficult and its overcoming all the more important. Where we no longer ask for feelings of comfort and soothing ideas in other artworks, it still seems reasonable to question the need for an architecture that may leave our daily satisfactions shaken or disoriented. But there is also, I suspect, a feeling that architec- ture lacks a certain philosophical depth that paint- ings and novels do not. Some recent, important work in architecture, Eisenman's among it, should change all that. In any case, Eisenman's architecture is inseparable from philosophical thinking, for example, thinking about the pos- sibilities of self.36 DAVID GOLDBLATT Department of Philosophy Denison University Granville, OH 43023 1. The notion of ecstasis has played a certain role in a good deal of philosophy from Pythagoras and Plato to Kierkegaard and Heidegger and so my concerns here are limited. 2.

The Birth of Tragedy, "brimming with artist's secrets," as he says later in his famous preface "Self-Criticism,' was of- fered as advice to artists contemporary to Nietzsche himself. On the other hand, the Bacchic experience was not de facto available for those artists acting alone. In the festival for Dionysus the commonplace self joins a transfiguring com- munity in a well-entrenched ritual where the raison d'etre was to dissolve, through orgiastic amnesia, a communion experienced en masse culminating in the appearance of Dionysus himself. Leaving the commonplace meant joining a common throng, the participants together acting in an uncommon way, sharing an experience that with respect to the everyday self was radically dislocating. But for Nietz- sche, it was only by virtue of stepping outside the self-in- everyday activity, that art could happen. For Nietzsche, one's own will needed to be exteriorized in order to inter- nalize art since the artistic self was not located in the trans- parent, "common sense" world. 24.

For example, one of the major visual elements, the so- called scaffolding, is actually non-sheltering, an outside passage unscaled to human proportions. 35. It is an irony for Eisenman, who intended to distance his self from the aesthetic, that the arbitrary text will have powerful aesthetic implications for any architectural project and that, given his anti-avant-garde position, his projects are exciting from an aesthetic point of view. Furthermore, there is no question that Eisenman's work, especially his more recent work, is not perceptually indiscernible from tradi- tional architecture. 36.
