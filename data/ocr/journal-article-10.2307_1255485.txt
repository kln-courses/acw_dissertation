<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ETHNOLOGICAL SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO EASTER ISLAND, OR RAPANUI. BY HENRY BALFOUR, I HAVE been invited to contribute as a supplement to Mrs. Routledge's most interesting paper on Easter Island the gist of certain suggestions which I have recently made concerning the ethnology of the island. I have great pleasures in so doing, although my ideas have as yet had but little chance of maturing and are still in a somewhat embryonic state. My spare time has been given up to war-work abroad, and I have in consequence been unable to refer to much of the material contained in museums and in the literature. The following notes I offer as a tentative sketch only, with the idea of suggesting what may prove a fruitful line of enquiry. The solution of the ethnological problem of Easter Islard culture has always presented the greatest difficulty, and it still remains one of the most baffling of puzzles. One is glad that the case has been re-opened for discussion by the enterprising and remark- able expedition which was undertaken by Mr. and Mrs. Routledge and has been so happily brought to a successful conclusion. There are certain prominent features in the culture of the Easter Islanders with which especially I wish to deal, in the hopes that I may be able to suggest certain lines of enquiry which may prove of value to those who propose to pursue researches in this subject, and who aim at diag- nosing the complex cultural elements which are so striking a feature of this remote volcanic island. These are (I) the</page><page sequence="2">Some Ethnological Suggestions mataa, or implements of obsidian, (2) the carved wooden figures representing the human form, (3) the huge mono- lithic statues, (4) certain rock-sculptures in relief, engravings and paintings representing birds and bird-headed human figures, (5) the very remarkable ideographic script, (6) the elaborate bird-cult. These I will deal with briefly seriatim. I. The mataa, or obsidian implements, which have been found in great abundance over the island. These are for the most part roughly made from flakes (often very large and thick) struck from the blocks of volcanic glass. In the more characteristic examples, the butts are more or less carefully trimmed down by flaking so as to form peduncles or tangs for hafting on the ends of wooden handles. The broad blade is usually left unaltered, and as the shape depends upon that assumed by the flake when struck off the block, many of the implements are very irregular and unsymmetrical in outline. Some examples show a slight trimming of the edges to improve the form of the blade, but these are exceptional. The more typical and perfect specimens in their outline resemble the " ace of spades" (Fig. I). Now this implement is not only characteristic of but almost peculiar to Easter Island, and parallels to it are by no means easy to find. An interesting analogy is seen in a fine obsidian blade with hafting tang which was found below the surface of the ground in a creek draining into the Yodda Valley in the Northern Division of British New Guinea. It is in the possession of Mr. D. Ballantine. This specimen has been described and figured by Dr. C. G. Seligmann,1 who draws attention to the striking resemblance to the mataa of Easter Island. It is, however, of better workmanship than the latter, the tanged butt is more carefully flaked to the desired form; also the shoulders are steeply and symmetrically sloped in a manner which is l Man, Nov. 1915, No. 9I, pi. M.; also in Anthrop. Essays presented to E. B. Tylor, I907, pl. viii. fig. 2, and p. 327. 357</page><page sequence="3">Some Ethnological Suggestions not characteristic of the mataa. Obsidian implements, other than flakes; are extremely rare in British New Guinea and very few specimens have been procured. It is of interest to note that the above mentioned example comes from a part of New Guinea which is within the area influenced by Melanesian culture. Among the stone implements of the Chatham Islands are recorded a number of pedunculated blades of flint, chert and schist, to which Giglioli 1 gives the native name mata (a name also given to them by von Haast) and which he says resemble exactly the mataa of Easter Island, al- though they are not of obsidian. I have not had access to these Chatham Islands examples, nor have I seen many illustrations of them, so that I cannot tell how far the resemblance holds good. The culture of the Moriori, in the main linked with that of the Maori, suggests traces of a Melanesian element, just as in the culture of the Maori of New Zeala d evidence of early Melanesian influence is noticeable, and is supported by the native traditions of an early, pre-Maori, population-a tall, slim, dark-skinned, flat-faced, flat-nosed and furtive and treacherous people, with projecting eye-brows and with hair which was often bushy or frizzly, who were known to the Maori as Maruiwi.2 These may have been responsible, in part at any rate, for the several Melanesian characteristics observable in Maori art, industries and customs. Many of the Maruiwi event- ually found their way to the Chatham Islands, to escape from their Maori oppressors, who nearly exterminated them. It is at least possible that the mata of the Chatham Islands may be of Melanesian origin, but this cannot be proved at present with any degree of certainty. I make the suggestion for the sake of its possible bearing upon the Easter Island problem in general. 1 Materiali, I901, p. 38, and La Collezione Elnografica, I9II, pt. i. p. 105. Elsdon Best, Trans.

The only other part of the world which, as far as I can recollect at the moment, offers parallels to the Easter Island mataa, is Japan, where tanged or pedunculated blades of stone, frequently of obsidian, occur which cer- tainly recall to some extent the form and technique of the mataa. The parallel is not a very close one, however, and the resemblance may, perhaps, be fortuitous. II. The carved figures of toromiro wood representing the human form. These are too well known to need detailed description. Numerous examples have been brought from Easter Island and may be seen in museums, and many have been figured and described. These in their most typical form exhibit a type of conventionalized render- ing of the human form which is peculiar to Rapanui and finds no near parallel elsewhere. The nose is often very strongly aquiline, even to a highly exaggerated degree. The brows are exceedingly prominent and over- hanging. The staring eyes are of obsidian set in bone. The ears are distended, the lobes being greatly elongated, indicating the custom of wearing large plugs or rings as ?ornaments. Many of the figures have a very pronounced " goatee " beard, though no other facial hair is indicated. Many also are represented as greatly emaciated, the ribs and vertebral column being strongly indicated, the abdomen deeply sunken, and the orbits of the eyes hollow and with prominent lower margins. It is clear that the actual native type is not here represented and that a conven- tional rendering has been arrived at, just as in the Mar- quisas group, Hawaiian Islands and many other Pacific groups one finds local schools of art producing their own fanciful anthropomorphic types. The markedly aquiline nose reminds one of a Papuan type in New Guinea, rather than of a Polynesian or Melanesian type; but since the nasal convexity appears, as far as I can see without further reference, to be especially exaggerated in the emaciated figures, it is just possible that it may originally have been 359</page><page sequence="5">Some Ethnological Suggestions suggested by the retrocession of the cartilaginous extremity of the nose, due to shrinkage of the tissues either post mortem or as a result of hunger-emaciation. If this be so, this feature would be pathological rather than normal and to be accounted for on other than ethnological lines. These emaciated figures call to mind certain rude carvings in wood or pumice-stone from the Chatham Islands, in which the ribs and backbone are very strongly indicated.1 The same peculiarity appears in some of the tree carvings. in the same islands, 'representing skeleton-like figures cut in the bark of the kopi or karaka 'tree, as described by Dr. A. Denby,2 who supports the theory of an early Mela- nesian occupation of the Chatham Islands. The prominent brow-ridges seem to suggest a Melanesian or a Papuan type, while the elongated ear-lobes are decidedly Melanesian, the practice of distending the lobes with large disks or rings being, in the Pacific, specially associated with the Melanesian area and but rarely seen in Polynesia. In the Marquisas group, it is true, this practice obtains as a prominent feature, but here too it is linked with other unmistakably Melanesian culture-elements. In the pic- ture of a typical Easter Islander published in De Reis van Mr. Jacob Roggeveen (Mulert edition, I9II), the man appears wearing a "goatee" beard without other facial hair, and it is possible that a native fashion may be indicated in the beards of the wooden figures. But the beard in this photograph is far less crisply defined than are the " imperials " of the carvings, and it may be that this feature may have been suggested by some of the early European voyagers, who were looked upon as gods and may have been perpetuated as such in sculpture. That por- traiture was to some extent practised in connection with these wooden figures is borne out by a small example 1Cf. Partington's Album of the Pacific, iii. pl. 223, fig. I. Also a specimen in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford. 2 T.N.Z. Inst. 19o1, xxxiv. p. 130, and pl. v. 360</page><page sequence="6">in regard to Easter Island. given by George Griffiths in I859 to the Ashmolean Museum, and now in the Pitt Rivers Museum. This was stated to be a portrait of Captain Cook. This example, as one would expect, has no beard and the ears are represented of the normal shape, in contrast with the greatly distended ears which usually prevail in these figures. It is always possible that this latter Melanesian attribute may have been grafted upon features suggested by a different people. There were " long-eared" people still living upon Easter Island at the time of its discovery by Roggeveen in 1722, and also when Captain Cook visited the island in I774, though whether these were the remnant of a Melanesian stock or Polynesians who had adopted from Melanesians the practice of distending the ear-lobe, is not clear. The native traditional history leads us to suppose that when the " short-eared " Polynesians arrived, they found the island already inhabited by a "long-eared" people (pre- sumably of Melanesian origin), who were almost or quite exterminated by the new-comers. Another noteworthy feature of the wooden statuettes of Easter Island is the mouth. In most of the sculptures the lips are straight and thin; in others, especially the emaciated ones, the mouth is almost dumb-bell shaped, recalling a type very prevalent in the conventional carvings of the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand. III. The monolithic statues. Perhaps the most striking feature in Easter Island culture is the very numerous huge monolithic effigies, hewn from the solid volcanic rock in the crater of Rano Roraku and erected often upon stone platforms or terraces, ahu, in various parts of the island. These have received special attention from Mr. and Mrs. Routledge, and will no doubt be fully described by them. Suffice it for me to draw attention to certain special points in regard to them, which have a bearing upon the suggestion which I wish to offer. In facial form they differ from any normal native type either Polynesian or Melanesian, nor 36i</page><page sequence="7">362 Some Ethnological Suggestions DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIONS. FIG. I.

In order to find possible affinities, we must, I think, seek them outside the Polynesian area. Certain well-marked and prevalent peculiarities may be noted as characteristic of these remarkable statues (Figs. 2 and 3) : (I) the prominent, overhanging brow; (2) the absence of any indication of the eyes, which are sufficiently suggested by the hard, dark shadows cast by the overhanging brow- ridges; (3) the very long, concave nose (differing markedly from the arched noses of the wooden figures); (4) the pro- truding or "pouting" lips; (5) the prominent, pointed chin; (6) the greatly distended ear-lobes (Fig. 3a); and, lastly, (7) the cylindrical so-called "hats " or " crowns" of red volcanic tufa, which originally surmounted the heads of many of the statues. Now, there is only one region in the Pacific in which I have been able to find representations of human form in which the above-mentioned characteristics appear associated together in such a manner as to suggest an affinity with the Easter Island statues, and this is the Solomon Island group in the Melanesian area. Some years ago I made a study of the so-called " canoe- prow gods " and other representations of human form from New Georgia, San Cristoval and other parts of the Solomon Islands 1 (Figs. 4 and 5). My then object was to account, if possible, for the very excessive prognathism which is so pronounced a conventional feature of these figures. The slight prognathic tendency of the native type is not sufficient to explain this grotesque exaggeration. I dis- covered an apparent solution in the influence of another totally distinct design, that of the Frigate-bird, the explana- tion being that the conventional result was arrived at by hybridization of two designs. The human form and the frigate-bird are very constantly associated together in close 1.Man, June, 1905, No. 50, and pl. F. 366</page><page sequence="12">in regard to Easter Island. juxtaposition in the art of the Solomon Islands, and are moreover closely related by the fact that the frigate-bird, Daula, is the central figure of a wide-spread Melanesian bird-cult. It is a kind of super-bird possessed of a tindalo, or spirit, endowing it with human or superhuman powers. In representations of the frigate-bird we frequently see human attributes grafted upon the bird figure. For instance, in the carved wooden Solomon Island bowl (Fig. 6) representing a frigate-bird holding a large fish, a pair of human arms and hands are seen issuing from the bird's breast just below the neck and grasping the body of the fish. Similarly, in a figure of the same bird with outstretched wings, represented upon the blade of a canoe-paddle (Fig. 7), an unmistakably human arm is shown arising from a kind of shoulder, in defiance of anatomical difficulties. Even bracelets are indicated upon this arm. Again, composite forms in which the bird- and human- form are variously combined are seen in numerous instances of figures having the body of a bird combined with human head (Fig. 8), or, conversely, human body with bird's head (Fig. 9). This particular figure is said to represent Kesoko, half man half frigate-bird; the hooked beak of this bird is well indicated. In the British Museum there are two carved canoe-charms from Rubiana which are almost identical, except for the fact that whereas in the one (Fig. Io) the bird's body is surmounted by a frigate- bird's head with the gular pouch indicated; in the other (Fig. I I) the bird's head is replaced by a semi-human head, of the type familiar in the "canoe-prow gods," showing greatly exaggerated prognathism. This beak-like protrusion of the lower facial region seems clearly to have been suggested by the form of the bird's beak which it replaces, Two other examples of human-headed birds, in the Pitt Rivers Museum, emphasize this hybridization of bird- 367</page><page sequence="13">Some Ethnological Suggestions and human-form. In the one (Fig. I2) the head is still clearly recognizable as human, in spite of its very pro- longed beak-like snout. In the other (Fig. 13) it is only saved from being non-human by the presence of a well- defined nose lying along the ridge of the " beak." Without multiplying instances, I think it is fair to recog- nize as evident that the excessive prognathism which characterizes so many of the representations of human form in Solomon Island art, is due to fusion of bird and human motifs, and that the composite conventional result is intimately associated with and, indeed, a product of a cult of the frigate-bird. The cult itself, no doubt, is concerned with the problem either of securing safety at sea, or of promoting good luck in fishing, or, more pro- bably, both. In the paper above referred to, I carried the point further, and showed that the conventional highly progna- thous type so arrived at has tended to dominate the would- be realistic art in the Solomon Islands. In very many of the carvings and drawings 6f the human head which are intended to be realistic, we can recognize to a greater or lesser extent the " canoe-prow god" type, and it would appear that the Solomon Island artists have been obsessed by this traditional modified type and that their would-be realistic renderings of the human form are largely dominated by it. One of the instances which I figured in support of this view is an actual portrait-study of one native of New Georgia by another. To return to Easter Island. In this conventionalized rendering of the human form in the Solomon Islands, we find all the characteristics above enumerated in describing the monolithic statues of Rapanui. They are not all necessarily associated together in any one specimen, but they are all sufficiently frequently present in the Solomon Island figures to suggest the probability of the resemblance observable in the art-products of these two widely separated 368</page><page sequence="14">in regard to Easter Island. regions being other than merely fortuitous. The heavy, overhanging brow, the long, upward-curving nose, the protruding lips and prominent chin of the Rapanui statues all find a parallel in the figures from the Solomon Islands. The distended ear-lobe is usually very marked in the more strictly human figures from the latter group. It is true that the eyes are nearly always indicated in the Solomon Islands (usually by inset pieces of pearl-shell), but occasion- ally they are omitted and are merely suggested by the shadows cast by the overhanging brow, as, for instance, in the specimen shown in Fig. 14, which in this respect adds another point of similarity to the Easter Island statues, which are eyeless. Lastly, in connection with these statues, I have a sug- gestion to make in regard to the so-called " hats," or ' crowns." These, as I have already mentioned, are huge cylinders of red volcanic ash or tufa, which were placed on the tops of the heads of some of the effigies. Now, if these merely represented hats or other head-gear, it is difficult to see why the natives did not carve them out of the rock in one piece with the statues. That would have been an easy and obvious method of arriving at an adequate result where only a hat was intended. Why, then, did they take the trouble to go nearly across the island to another crater in the Teraai Hills (some 7 miles or so from Rano Roraku, where the statues themselves were hewn out), in order to employ as material for the "hats" a special kind of very rough rock, a vesicular red tufa ? I wish to urge as a tentative and heterodox suggestion, that the reason was that these red cylinders were not intended to represent hats at all, but hair. The selection of a particularly rough, vesicular rock for such a purpose would be natural enough; but I may be asked, why should a red material be specially used, when the normal native hair-colour would be black or very dark. To find an explanation of this, we may again turn to the 2A 369</page><page sequence="15">Some Ethnolog-ical Suggestions Solomon Islands. In this group (though not exclusively, as the fashion is followed elsewhere, e.g. in Samoa) it is locally a common practice to bleach the hair by using lime, with the result that the normally dark hair acquires a light-brown, reddish or yellowish colour. In the northern islands of the group the hair is sometimes coated with red ochreous earth. Throughout the group much attention is given to hair-dressing, which forms an important occupation of daily life. Most of the carved wooden human figures from the Solomon Islands, to which I have referred, have the hair indicated of a light colour, sometimes by leaving the light wood unstained, sometimes by colouring the top of the head red. In the more realistic examples the hair is represented by a number of minute vegetable burrs, crowded closely together over the head, so as to give the desired effect of a rough surface, and stained a red colour. In others, again, a light brown or yellowish tow is used. My suggestion, then, is that the cylindrical accessories which were placed upon the heads of the Rapanui statues were intended to represent the hair mass, that the natives specially selected a rough, vesicular tufaceous rock as material, in order to give the effect of hair which was not straight or but slightly waving, like the hair of Polynesians, but rather curly or frizzly, like the prevailing Melanesian hair-type. Further, that a red tufa was selected in order to conform with the practice, common enough in Melanesia, of bleaching the hair to a reddish colour with lime, or of coating it with red ochre. It still remains to account for the cylindrical shape given to these tufaceous masses. Why, if they represent hair, were they not hemispherical like the hair mass as usually represented in the wooden carvings, as is seen, for instance, in the Solomon Island figures? This shape was, I think, mainly imposed by necessity. The red tufa " crowns " were made on one spot in the island, and had to be transported often many miles to the places where were erected the statues which they 370</page><page sequence="16">in regard to Easter Island. were destined to embellish. They could not be carried, since some of them measured as much as IO or 12 feet in diameter, and their weight ran into tons, They could only be moved by rolling, and for this the cylindrical form was obviously most effective, in fact imperative. On arrival at the site of the statue the "crown" appears to have been completed by slightly hollowing the base to fit the top of the head, and by cutting a boss or knob on the upper end. This boss may, possibly, represent a com- promise between the desired rounded upper surface of the block representing hair, and the imposed cylindrical form, which had to be retained until the " crown " was actually in its place on the head of the statue, since, in order to get it there, it was necessary to erect in each case a long, inclined causeway up which the " crown " could be rolled to the requisite height. The fact that these " crowns" were not exactly centred upon the top of the head, but were arranged to project more in front than at the back, may be due to a desire to combine with the representation of the hair mass, the effect of the forward-projecting palm-leaf eye-shade, which is so very commonly worn in Melanesia to protect the eyes from the sun's glare. These consist of broad flaps pro- jecting over the forehead only and kept in position by a narrow band passing round the head. An interesting point to note in connection with the probable affinity which is suggested by a comparison of the Easter Island statues with the Solomon Islands carvings, is that just as the latter are intimately connected with a sea-bird cult (frigate-bird), so too are the former also connected with elaborate ceremonial observances associated with sea-birds, to which reference must now be made. IV. The Bird-cult and certain rock-sculptures, paintings and engravings in Easter Island. The ornithology of the bird-cult in Easter Island is somewhat confused by the fact that whereas, in later times at any rate, the bird, 37:I</page><page sequence="17">Some Ethnological Suggestions Manu tara, which dominated the cult was a tern (the Sooty tern, sterna fuliginosa, known to sailors as the "Wide-awake," or "Egg-bird") and not a frigate-bird, there is, none the less, abundant evidence that the remains or reminiscence of a cult having the frigate-bird as central figure, existed, or, should I say, persisted in Easter Island, as I hope to prove. The Terns and the Frigate-birds are, of course, very distinct one from the other. The former are classed with the Gaviae, the latter with the Steganopodes. Both, it is true, are web-footed sea-birds, and both possess forked tails; but a point of difference which I must especially emphasize now, lies in the form of the beak. The tern's beak is nearly straight and sharply pointed, that of the frigate-bird is strongly hooked at the end of the upper mandible. I would also note the presence in the latter bird of a well-defined gular pouch, which is entirely absent in the terns. The Sooty Tern breeds often in great colonies on rocky islands and reefs (the so-called "Wide-awake Fairs" on Ascension Islands are especially famous). One of its regular breeding-places is the small rocky island of Moto Nui, lying off the S.W. end of Easter Island close to the crater of Rano Kao. Mrs. Routledge has described the great annual ceremony which was observed by the Easter Islanders, in which the main feature was a competition to secure the first egg of the season after the arrival of the terns at their nesting site; and how the lucky winner in the race became the Bird-man of the year, enjoyed certain privileges combined with some discomfort due to his being placed under a rigid tabu. The sacred egg was preserved in his house until the next season. Now, many of the rock-sculptures in relief, engravings and paintings found at Orongo on the lip of the crater of Rano Kao, are evidently connected directly with this cult. Some of the engravings clearly represent the Manu 372</page><page sequence="18">in regard to Easter Island. tara (Sooty tern) itself (Fig. 15), the strazght, pointed beak andforked tail pointing to this bird. But many of the other representations equally clearly represent the frigate- bird, with hooked beak and forked tail, or in several instances portray an anthropomorphized bird having frigate-bird attributes. I shall refer to many of these designs later when dealing with the hieroglyphic symbols on the inscribed tablets, but I would specially draw attention here to some examples of the designs representing half-bird half-man figures, of which more than Ioo were seen by Mr. and Mrs. Routledge carved in relief on the rocks at Orongo, the centre of the annual ceremony, which are believed to represent the Bird-men, or winners in the successive annual races for the sacred egg. One of the illustrations which I give (Fig. 16) represents a bird-headed human figure grotesquely rendered, and another (Fig. 17) shows a similar figure which has a special interest, inasmuch as it is represented as carrying the sacred egg in its hand. Presumably, both these designs are concerned with the cult of Manu tara, and the second example certainly seems to represent the Bird-man carrying his trophy. At the same time, it cannot be said that the sharp, straight beak of the tern is at all clearly indicated, the beaks are in fact thick and heavy- looking. Moreover, the suggestion (especially pronounced in Fig. 17) of a gular pouch, seems to point to contamination with older designs representing the frigate-bird. That these designs were modified from an original representing the anthropomorphized frigate-bird is practically proved by three examples collected during the visit of the German cruiser " Hyane," which are figured by Geiseler.1 In each instance two identical figures having human bodies and birds' heads are shown seated opposite to one another with hands joined. In two of the designs which are bas-reliefs on stone-slabs, the birds' beaks curve strongly downward at the tips, while in the third, of which I give a copy (Fig. 1 ster Insel, I883, plates 15, 17 and 18. 373</page><page sequence="19">Some Ethnological Suggestions 18),1 the beaks are very decidedly hooked at the extremity, betraying the frigate-bird prototype clearly. These figures, according to Geiseler, represent Make-make, the god of the sea-bird's egg (i.e. of the tern's egg). It is remarkable, therefore, that he should be represented with the head of a frigate-bird. This mystery is, however, partly solved if we regard these representations as derived from an older cult of the frigate-bird, whose symbolism was retained even after a new cult-bird had replaced it. A comparison of Fig. I8 with Fig. 9 in my illustrations brings out the remarkable apparent fact that Make-make, represented in this guise, is identical with Kesoko of New Georgia in the Solomon Islands! This seems to point to a recollection retained by the immigrants into Easter Island of a former cult of the frigate-bird which was practised in a region where this bird was a familiar feature, and which was gradually given up in the new environment where this bird, though probably not unknown, was certainly not abundant. The frigate-bird does not appear to breed on Easter Island; ndeed, the island offers little attraction as a nesting site to a bird which usually nests in trees. It appears probable that the older (Melanesian) cult was superseded by a new cult, of which the locally abundant sooty tern became the object. The evidence derived from comparative technology suggests very forcibly that the Melanesian area, and more particularly the Solomon Islands group, was the original home of the prototype of the frigate-bird cult which became decadent and finally obsolete after immigration into Easter Island. V. The script engraved on zeooden tablets. The most remarkable and puzzling element in the art of the Easter Islanders is undoubtedly the elaborate form of ideographic " boustrophedon " script, which has proved so insoluble an ethnological enigma. The inscribed tablets are too well known to need general description here, and many repro- 1 One only of the paired figures is represented here. 374</page><page sequence="20">in regard to Easier Island. ductions of them are accessible. In spite of numerous attempts to decipher the ideographic pictographs, the efforts have as yet been almost unavailing. No other similar form of script is known from the Pacific Islands, unless we admit some analogy in the hieroglyphs of the Chatham Islands, referred to by Dr. H. O. Forbes,' or in the geographically still more remote script described by Mr. J. M. Brown 2 from the island of Uleai in the Western Caroline Islands. This latter script is syllabic, whereas that of Easter Island is ideographic, and, moreover, the signs employed in the former do not suggest any near relationship to the latter. My object now is to call attention to the fact that many of the ideographic signs in the Rapanuian script find striking counterparts in designs still employed in the Solomon Islands. Additional evidence is thus forthcoming of a culture-link between this Melanesian group and Easter Island. I have not had time to examine critically all the signs used in the Easter Island script, but I select a few which appear to me to be significant. One thing is very noticeable. Of all the bird-symbols which are so very abundantly represented in the script under a variety of fornis, by far the greater proportion clearly represent thefrigate-bird (as indicated by the strongly hooked beak) and not the Manu tara, or sacred tern. The birds are variously depicted, some more or less realistically, others conventionally and often with human attributes, and I give the following characteristic examples, together with analogous (perhaps homologous) designs from the Solomon Islands.

Similar design engraved on a lime gourd, New Georgia. FIG. 21. Pictograph of double-headed frigate-bird, Easter Island,1 for comparison with FIG. 2Ia. Pearl-shell pendant in form of double-headed frigate-bird from New Georgia. FIG. 22. Pictograph of frigate-bird depicted with one fore-limb represented as a normal wing and the other as a human arm holding up a fish, Easter Island, for comparison with FIG. 22a. Design of frigate-bird similarly represented with one normal wing and the other converted into a human arm and hand holding a fish; carved on a dancing paddle from the Solomon Islands. This is, I think, a most striking instance of exact paral- lelism. The symbolism in the two designs must surely be identical! From the frequency with which the frigate-bird appears in the Easter Island script, it seems probable that the script itself originated in the Melanesian area and was perfected in Easter Island while the memory of this bird and of its cult-associations still persisted. The newer bird-cult connected with the tern seems to have had but little influence upon the script. Bird-headed human figures abound in the Easter Island script, as, for instance, Fig. 23, Pictograph of very progna- thous human being, in profile, seated and with hand raised, for comparison with Fig. 23a. Similar design but repre- sented with frigate-bird's head (Kesoko), cut upon bamboo, from Mungeri district, New Georgia (cf. Fig. 9). Figures 24 Compare rock-sculpture figured by W. J. Thomson, Rep.

Lastly, I give a striking parallel derived from figures of the human form without avian attributes. Fig. 34, Picto- graph of a man seated in a peculiar, conventional manner, with legs wide apart, " spread-eagle " fashion. The hands are raised and one is holding a fish. The head is repre- sented with lateral appendages indicating, no doubt, the largely distended ears already referred to-Easter Island ; for comparison with Fig. 34a, Design of human figure represented rather more realistically in an identical attitude, with wide-spread legs, upraised hands and dilated ear- lobes indicated by large lateral appendages. The figure is not shown holding up a fish as in the pictograph, but on either side of it a fish is represented. Again, I think, a very striking parallel. CONCLUSION. What are we to infer from the ethnological parallels to which I have drawn attention ? Many of the coincidences revealed by a comparative study of the culture of Easter Island and of the Western Pacific, may appear to be of trivial importance if taken singly; but many, on the other hand, are sufficiently striking in them- selves, and when all are taken together, the cumulative effect of the evidence is far too important to be overlooked and lightly set aside. I venture to think that the following points arise from the evidence available. (I) That the culture of Easter Island is definitely com- posite and exhibits traces of fusion of at least two distinct culture-stocks. (2) That a Melanesian migration at one time, or inter- mittently, ranged eastwards over the Pacific, and that these people reached Rapanui, amongst other islands, and took root there. That typical elements of Melanesian culture were thus introduced into the island, including the practice of distending the ear-lobe, characteristic 377</page><page sequence="23">Some Ethnological Sugg-estions style in art, certain types of implements, and the well-established cult of the frigate-bird, which was probably connected with rites aiming at increasing the fish-supply. (3) That at a later time, a wave of Polynesian immigrants arrived and eventually conquered, partly exterminated and partly absorbed the " long-eared" Melanesians, though they retained, and continued to perpetuate in their art, many of the features of Melanesian culture. (4) That in the new environment a new bird-cult, aiming at promoting another important source of food-supply (viz. birds and bird's eggs), was initiated and gradually supplanted the older cult. This new cult may have been started and developed either by the Melanesians, who no longer found the frigate-bird a dominant feature in their new surroundings, and who may thus have been led to adopt the sooty tern, which was locally very prominent and abundant and afforded a valuable supply of food-or, possibly, it may have been initiated by the Polynesian invaders. Anyway, the cult of the Sooty tern, while practi- cally ousting the cult of the Frigate-bird, did not entirely obliterate the latter, of which very many traces persisted in the art of the island, in the motifs expressed in sculpture, engraving and painting, and particularly in the ideographic script. It is possible, even, in view of the great importance of the fish-supply, that the frigate-bird may have been long retained in high esteem, and that its cult persisted concurrently with that of the tern. (5) That, in seeking in the Melanesian area for possible clues to the origin of certain non-Polynesian elements in the culture of Easter Island, the group of islands which has special claim to consideration and further investigation, is that of the Solomon Islands. Amongst other things, it seems likely that the symbolism of many of the ideographic signs employed in the Easter Island script, may be explained by a study on the spot of the closely similar designs still 378</page><page sequence="24">in regard to Easter Island. used in the Solomon Islands, the symbolic significance of which might be ascertained before it is too late. Certain affinities suggested by the implements and art, etc., of the Chatham Islands, of New Zealand and of British New Guinea, also merit attention and call for fur- ther research. I have already referred to certain points of resemblance, and I would suggest further that a com- parative study of the manaia design in New Zealand art, might lead to an elucidation of certain conventional signs frequently occurring in the Easter Island script. The problem of Easter Island seems to involve incidentally a fresh discussion upon the possible or probable Melanesian element in New Zealand and the Chatham Islands. That well-defined traces of this non-Polynesian element are to be distinguished in the culture of these islands, has been questioned by several able observers, but to others, with whom I find myself in agreement, it is difficult to explain certain " Maori " and '' Moriori " culture-phenomena unless we recognize that there has been influence from Melanesia. As to the spread of Melanesianism, if I may use the term, over the Polynesian area, much might be said, but space does not admit of my entering upon so wide a subject. I will merely recall Mr. Basil Thomson's statement that in the Island of Niue he found evidence of Melanesian and Polynesian admixture, and also refer to the fact that in the far-easterly and very-Polynesian Marquisas Islands, there is very striking evidence pointing unmistakably to culture-contact with the Melanesian area. I may conclude my remarks with a reference to another source of evidence which testifies to the presence of a Melanesian element in Easter Island, and which bears out not only the technological evidence which I have offered, but also the native traditions. I cannot do better than quote a passage from some remarks made by Mr. T. A. Joyce during the discussion of Mrs. Routledge's paper on Easter Island read before the Royal Geographical 379</page><page sequence="25">Some Ethnological Suggestions Society on 20th November, 1916. He said,' "There is just one other point which adds to the problems of the island. A few years ago, when Lord Crawford made his voyage, he brought back a lot of skulls which were deposited in the Natural History Museum, whither I went to measure them. I then wrote a paper which I never published; it remained both literally and metaphorically a skeleton in my anthropological cupboard. because I could not get away from the conclusion that in their measurements and general appearance these skulls were far more Melanesian than Polynesian. And I do not think I should have been bold enough to say this now if it had not been that quite recently Mr. Pycraft has been going over the material and studying the matter, and he, without knowing anything of my results, which I had carefully hidden, came to the same conclusion." I believe that Dr. Keith has quite recently arrived at a similar opinion after examining the physical characters of the osteological remains of Easter Islanders. Dr. Hamy, some thirty years ago, suggested a Papuan affinity for skulls found in Easter Island, which were said to differ in no essential feature from those obtained in New Guinea. The theory of a strong Melanesian element in Easter Island is, therefore, supported by native traditional history, by the arts, industries and cults of the natives, and, lastly, by the physical characters of the islanders. It is greatly to be hoped that under the fresh impulse afforded by the results of the Routledge expedition, the whole time-honoured problem of Easter Island may be reopened for discussion, and it is with much pleasure that I contribute these notes, sketchy and imperfect though they be. Not only is the problem one of the highest ethnological interest, but its attempted solution with the aid of material and information so zealously collected by 1 GeographicalJournal, xlix. p. 342. 380</page><page sequence="26">in regard to Easter Island. 381 Mr. and Mrs. Routledge, is the most effective return which can be made to them for their highly meritorious and successful undertaking.
