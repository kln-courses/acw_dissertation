<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION attack on the money-changers in the temple as basically an attack upon a mistaken idea of God.- FRANKLIN D. ELMER, JR. MORAN, JOHN W. Catholic Faith and Modern Theologies: The Theology of Emil Brunner. Worcester, Mass.: Hefferman Press, I948. Introd.+98 pages. $2.0o. Dr. Brunner's views on certain important doc- trines are set forth in eight brief chapters, mainly by means of excerpts from The Mediator, God and Man, The Philosophy of Religion, and The Divine Impera- tive. A parallel series of chapters sets forth Roman Catholic positions on the same points, together with arguments against Brunner's deviations from these. Dr. Brunner is acknowledged to be a "sin- cere and devout Christian" (p. 57), who holds orthodox views on many important subjects. (Introd.) But on some issues of major significance his judgment is woefully wrong. While Dr. Moran compares and contrasts clearly what Dr. Brunner believes and what Roman Catho- lics believe, he never comes clear on the major issue between them, namely, what it means to believe, to have faith. For this reason Dr. Moran talks past Dr. Brunner rather than argues with him. He argues on scriptural grounds-because Dr. Brunner may on his own testimony be expected to accept such argument (p. 27)-without coming to terms with Brunner's scripturalism. And he argues from reason without understanding the basis of Brunner's estimate of reason (p. 8). Actually, Dr. Brunner's dependence on both Scripture and reason is greater in some respects and less in others than is Dr. Moran's. To have indicated why this is so should have been a major task of such a book as this. The criticism of Dr. Brunner suggested by Dr. Moran's treatment is that he has not made himself clear to a careful reader. When, however, Dr. Moran moves from Scripture and reason to the consideration of the church, he shows his strength. Here he raises points which might well lead Dr. Brunner to consider some of his own utterances. Here Dr. Moran sees-if he does not clarify-the main issue, the issue of the nature of faith (p. 62).- GEORGE GORDH. NEWMAN, JOHN HENRY. Essays and Sketches. Edited with introductions by CHARLES FRED- ERICK HARROLD. 3 vols. New York: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., I948. Each vol., $3.50. This marks the appearance of three additional volumes of the new Newman edition. The essays in these volumes are selected from Newman's His- torical Sketches, Essays Critical and Historical, and Discussions and Arguments. On the whole, the editor has made a wise selection of materials that exhibits the wide range of Newman's early interests, his thoughts while the leader of the Tractarian movement, and his movement into the Roman church. It is to be regretted that additional inter- pretive material was not supplied in the intro- ductions. Also, it is most unfortunate that Professor Harrold's labor of love was cut short by death last autumn. The publishers have decided to complete the edition, but they have not yet selected a new editor.-JERALD C. BRAUER. PHILLIPS, HAROLD COOKE. Bearing Witness to the Truth. Nashville: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1949. 219 pages. $2.50. To choose a subject for the annual Yale Lectures which will not be a repetition is no easy task. Dr. Phillips has met that problem not by trying to squeeze into some restricted untouched area but rather by going deeper into the timeless fundamen- tals underlying the specifics of the preacher's mes- sage and work. Actually the six chapters could be divided into two main headings. The first three and the last deal with the nature of truth and our ways of knowing it. At the outset, Phillips makes clear that "our primary interest is not philosophic but religious." Central to the Christian faith is the belief in revelation, "that truth by its very nature is communicative." The point is made that in the discovery of all truth there is a moral requirement. In religious truth, however, this requirement becomes prior and imperative. "The preparation required for the apprehension of spiritual truth is not technical, else God could speak only to the learned; rather it is the kind of prepara- tion open to all. The requirements are mental and spiritual-singleness of heart and purpose." These Christian truths, when firmly grasped, fundamentally change man's common life. "They work renaissances, reforms and revolutions," as C. E. Jefferson put it. The final chapter on "Christ the Truth" affirms the central discovery of the Christian community that the supreme truth is a "life rather than a law . .. because in personality God speaks more clearly and convincingly to man than through any other medium." Chapters iv and v deal with ways of bearing wit- ness to this truth through preaching. With a skilful use of Father Mapple's sermon in Moby Dick, Phil- lips illustrates the qualities of the effective sermon, suggesting that it is biblical, relevant, vivid, and has good terminal facilities! The structure of the book is clear and the writing throughout has the imagery and terseness of phrase which characterizes Phillips' preaching. In describ- ing the difference between Jesus and the Pharisees, for example, he says that "to them the past was a hitching post; to him a guidepost." The personal reaction of the reader, if he is re- sponsible for preaching today, is likely to be one of contrition. He will come to his pulpit realizing again that he is confronted by a task which, paradoxically, is impossible yet necessary. He will feel the compul- 328</page><page sequence="2">BOOK sion from which he cannot escape, though there will be many times when he may wish he were free from a task of so great magnitude. And, above all, he will know tht he needs courage-simple, rugged, God- given courage-if he really is to bear witness to the truth.-GENE E. BARTLETT. ROBINSON, H. WHEELER. The Cross of Hosea. Edited by ERNEST A. PAYNE. Philadelphia: Westmin- ster Press, 1949. 64 pages. $I.5o. A year ago Ernest A. Payne of Regent's Park Col- lege, Oxford, edited for posthumous publication H. Wheeler Robinson's Two Hebrew Prophets: Studies in Hosea and Ezekiel. The Cross of Hosea is an American issue of the first half of that volume. Both the title and the concern of the little book make it an addition to the author's well-known trilogy on the cross in the Old Testament. The author's point of departure in the interpre- tation of the prophet is the story of Hosea's mar- riage, which he accepts as a historical experience. He does not feel that Hosea married a woman known to be a harlot; rather the prophet describes her as such after her unfaithfulness. He treats the first and third chapters as accounts of one and the same event. That is, the third chapter is neither prelude nor se- quel to the first. The first he considers a biographer's report, the third an autobiographical fragment. But the little book is definitely not an essay in literary criticism. It serves rather to illustrate Pro- fessor Robinson's frequently published view on the character of biblical religion as a "theology of ex- perience." That there is no "otherness" in revela- tion, that human experience reveals God, and that the individualization of such experience is the apex of biblical development are pivotal points in his posi- tion. The Bible, he asserts, does not superimpose a theological structure upon the events of history; it goes deeper into them to discover their intrinsic na- ture and cosmic significance. But in this book one feels that the author's emphasis is psychological rather than historical. The Bible is a unity because, throughout, it finds "God in man." The truth about God is discovered by projecting the inner experience of men-finally, by the individual projection of per- sonal experiences. Robinson suggests that the Bible rejected material images of deity in favor of the "higher anthropomorphism" in which the human medium provides revelation with an instrument that is dynamic and ever moving forward. One wonders whether this immanentist view of revelation would really have been as great a bulwark against idolatry as the author thinks and whether Israel did not, in- deed, actually have a more substantial one. It is this reader's impression that the author's own carefully worked-out theological framework has not really been exhaustively illustrated in this little volume on Hosea. There is, after all, a difference between say- ing that "human experience can reveal God" and saying that the revealing activity of God is revealed in human experience.-J. COERT RYLAARSDAM. NOTES 329 SANGSTER, W. E. Let Me Commend. Nashville: Abington-Cokesbury Press, I948. I50 pages. $I.75. The title of this book on realistic evangelism is taken from Charles Wesley's plea, "O let me com- mend my Saviour to you." Dr. Sangster uses direct and understandable language in showing Christians how to do this effectively in our time. The author defines evangelism as "going to people outside" the church with the gospel. He contends that "the gospel is relevant" to our day and "has proved itself in age after age of crisis . . to be matched to world need." He feels that "our business is to proclaim" this gospel. The forms of evangelistic effort, including public platform approaches, teamwork, and personal witness, are dealt with in simple language and clear detail. Such a method is commendable for many church members, and certainly for a great majority of Americans. While most people in this country have at least a high-school education of a secular nature, few have more than a third-grade training in religious matters. Surely a very simple approach in telling of Jesus and his message for his day and ours is best suited for the needs of most of us. An understanding of what evangelism is and how it can be made to work is the double aim of the writer. He defines evangelism as "the good news of God" and contends that, while all Chris- tians are called to be evangelists, not all can be public preachers of the Word. Yet all can bring others to Christ through personal testimony and witness. Let Me Commend is a refreshing book. While the stress on practical methods is helpful, one feels at least a tendency toward oversimplification. Useful insights in dealing with individuals are evidenced, but would it not be better to offer these as "sug- gestions" than as "rules" for proceeding? Dr. Sangster recognizes the need for a complete gospel of both individual salvation and social re- demption. Yet his chief emphasis is on the former. His strategy for achieving social redemption solely through the work of the redeemed individual might be said to be lacking in method. Theologically, the book takes the Arminian position for granted, exalting man's ability to right his own wrongs by seriously limiting the ultimate power of God. To many who search for real answers to difficult prob- lems these days, this theology is inconclusive and incomplete. Yet, in spite of these criticisms, the reviewer has been helped by the realistically practical and constructive discussion of the subject of evangelism. Many of our ministers are afraid of evangelism, trying to forget or evade Charles Wesley's central theme. Surely, our chief business is to lead men and women to take a stand for Christ, committing their lives to his plan and purpose.-RAY FREEMAN JENNEY.</page></plain_text>
