Price: $40.00 During the dark hours of the night of December 9, 1960, tragedy struck the community of San Pedro Xo- lotla in rural Tlaxcala, Mexico. In the morning seven infants, all under the age of one year, were discovered dead, apparent victims of the bloodsucking witch known as tlahuelpuchi. Tlahuelpuchi is a dangerous, inherently evil and malevolent being, usually an unnatural female with power of animal transformation, who requires a meal of blood at least once a month, preferably though not exclusively from infants, and seeks out her small victims accordingly. She kills while in animal form by sucking blood from an infant at night, leaving char- acteristic telltale bruises on the small body which is discovered lifeless by the shocked household in the morning, sometimes lying on the floor near the door that the witch has left open. On this occasion Hugo Nutini was in the munic√≠pio and, being immediately alerted by a very upset resident, rushed to the scene. During the next five days Nutini, in conjunction with a state medical officer, conducted intensive investigations in the community detailing the ideological, physical, social, and psychological context of the event and its aftermath. This volume is the out- come of those investigations augmented by additional fieldwork regarding sucked infants, resulting in infor- mation on a total of 47 cases, and by exhaustive ex- plorations into the scholarly understanding of witchcraft phenomena in general. The result is a unique study of witchcraft, unusual in that it thoroughly explores both the empirical evidence and the indigenous interpreta- tion accorded evidence associated with events that, at the time, were understood and accepted by the people involved as due to supernatural causes. Nutini and Roberts' study goes well beyond the events of December 1960 in San Pedro Xolotla to ful- ly consider, in addition to the actual epidemic, a) the distribution of various forms of witchcraft beliefs in the ideological system of Mesoamerica, compounded as it is of pre-Hispanic, Hispanic Catholic, and African components; b) the nature of folk systems of witch- craft in contrast especially to the more traditional an- thropological interpretations of tribal witchcraft; c) the social and especially psychological components of the folk system as evidenced by reactions of the families and neighbors in San Pedro Xolotla affected by the epidemic; d) the changes in Tlaxcala in beliefs about bloodsucking witches during the last hundred years and especially from the late 1960s to the present; e) a general theory of culture change that focuses on the shift from belief in a sacralized cosmos to a secularized world as modernization invades a traditional community. The book, though lengthy, is generally well-written. Fre- quent summarization along the way also greatly assist the reader's progress through sometimes highly formal discussions of the many aspects and ramifications of this witchcraft event. There is a considerable amount of comparative critiquing of the scholarly literature on witchcraft which will be of interest to readers other than Mesoamerican specialists. Nutini and Roberts' comparison of folk systems of witchcraft with tribal witchcraft belief systems is one of the most engrossing elements of the study. The authors regard folk systems, as evidenced by the conduct and interpretation of the infant deaths in Tlaxcala, essentially as marginalized explanations of last resort. As such this type of belief system contrasts significantly with tribal uses of witchcraft and is far closer to the witchcraft sys- tems of sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe. Nuti- ni and Roberts' discussion of the psychological reactions of family and villagers to the bloodsucking incidents is also intriguing, especially for readers whose imago mundi does not admit of supernatural witchcraft and who therefore would not (could not) find the same measure of social-psychological explanation, catharsis, and healing in the personal and community procedures (particularly the intense introspection) employed by Tlaxcalans as they related the physical evidence of what had happened to the supernatural causes accepted for such events. Operationally for the villagers the work of the tla- huelpuchi was thought to be a form of punishment visited upon parents for some omission of ritual or ceremony, such that they failed to obtain the protective goodwill of spirits, thereby leaving their children open to attack by evil.

Psychologically Tlaxcalans used witchcraft to explain and validate how or why some infants died so young. Deaths before the age of one were regarded as unnatural deaths in this society where the usual high rate of infant mortality was greatest between one and five years. In this context belief in the tlahuelpuchi was not merely projective but lay in the realm of basic causality. It was further validated by particular details and sets of events traditionally associated with sucked infants. The pres- ence of such supportive details were vital as evidence of witchcraft and, in fact, were sometimes achieved by conscious or unconscious tampering and manipulation of events by actors. Even in strictly secular terms it is easy to be sympa- thetic towards most of the persons involved in such im- pression management. The tragic physical circumstances in which infants died are just as compelling as the man- ner in which those persons involved or responsible were exonerated and to some extent comforted by the belief that it was really a witch, not a true human, who took a baby's life. Nutini found that, in actuality, most of the infant deaths attributed to tlahuelpuchi were the result of accidental asphyxiation of the infant by the mother while nursing at night or accidental smothering by blankets or bedding during the cold, damp rainy months, always the preferred seasons (June-August, December-February) for tlahuelpuchi attacks. A few infant deaths were due to choking since babies were not burped after night feeding, and a few seem to have been deliberate cases of infanticide. These last may have been the tragic outcome of persistent high tensions between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in a strongly patrilocal society where some mothers-in-law become tyrannical and daughters- in-law, whose associations with their own families are irrevocably ended on the day of their marriages, have neither respite or escape from the incessant subordina- tion of their position nor means to express their grow- ing hostility and frustrations. In such cases deliberately taking the life of the child became a desperate act of retaliation either by mother-in-law or daughter-in-law. Fortunately, since the late 1960s both infant deaths and belief in bloodsucking witchcraft have declined rap- idly. The former has been due to better child-rearing practices as improved housing, more balanced diets, modern education, and improved medical practices have become available especially to women. The latter can be attributed both to the decline in the need for a caus- al mechanism as infant mortality dropped and to the increased secularization of belief systems as modern- ization has continued. Factory work, jobs in big cities, television, labor migration to the United States, access to modern education have irrevocably changed life in rural Tlaxcala. While tlahuelpuchi still exists to some extent as a loathsome figure in storytelling she is no longer needed as a causative element and has been effectively defanged. Those infant deaths that still occur are now understood in strictly naturalistic terms to be purely human events. Mary W. Helms</page></plain_text>
