<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRAISE POEMS The Katherine C. White Collection Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington March 8-May 27, 1984 The Seattle Art Museum recently opened its door into one of the most renowned, most es- teemed, and perhaps for some, most controv- ersial exhibitions of African art: a selection of objects from the Katherine C. White collec- tion, which the museum had been the some- what reluctant recipient of several years ago. The show consisted of over one hundred artifacts-only a small fraction of the over two thousand pieces bequeathed. Out of this select group, only fifty-three, documented in a forthcoming catalogue by Pam McClusky, Associate Curator at the Seattle Art Museum, will travel to other sites. The exhibition was the realization of an unfulfilled dream that Kat White herself had harbored in the months be- fore her death, and the selection of the pieces for the show, interspersed with photographs that she, a fine photographer in her own right, had taken in the field as well as with her commentary on some of the pieces, was in great measure an attempt to honor that dream. Many of the pieces had been previously exhibited; many were familiar from these shows and the publications that accompanied them. "Praise Poems," a retrospective exhibi- tion, carried special meaning to the many Af- ricanists whose paths had crossed Kat White's during the twenty years over which she had built the collection. It was in this particular setting and its circumstances that the pieces attracted new interest. Curators make choices differentially, based on their own perceptions, predilections, and interpretations. In this case, the choice was in part made by Kat her- self. The curator, who worked with her in the last weeks, tried with great dedication to honor that choice and to convey Kat's percep- tion of her collection through the accompany- ing poetry and verse. Thus, while the exhibi- tion selection may have appeared of uneven quality to the connoisseur, its evenness lay in the overall unity of one collector's perception of her own aesthetic preferences. While I walked through the show, flashes of the past returned to mind, as they undoubt- edly did for others who knew Kat even better than I, in closer working relationships. I re- called once asking her how she ever got into collecting ethnographic art. She replied sim- ply, "Well, I always liked collecting things. And some people collect one kind of thing, some another." We all collect material things. For some of us, the the artifacts we have ac- quired over time are the end product of years of experience in and affinity with a particular milieu. For others, art and artifact evoke a more distant, subliminal reaction or rationale. Whatever the reason for our choice, each ob- ject we choose to structure our immediate en- vironment with is like a memory container that, like Simonide's treatises or Camillo's Renaissance theater, becomes an actor on the stage of human existence. Memory containers capture and communi- cate. Thus, they are not only a mnemonic of experience per se, but a mnemonic of a par- ticular value system. In cultures where liter- acy is minimal, where oral traditions and the visual image are the primary systems of human communication, the aesthetic inher- ent in the value system is forcefully communi- cated through the eyes and the ears; it is ar- ticulated through motion in space. I recollected a visit with Kat White a few days before she died, shortly after I had re- turned from Guinea. Knowing that there wasn't much time left, I tried to imagine what could be the most meaningful experience for her, given the circumstances, and in the end, I brought over some tapes and slides from my own most recent African experience. One last time perhaps, by saturating the environment with sound and visual imagery, one could bring to life again the host of anthropomor- phic objects that surrounded her; one could evoke them to perform, in one last journey, within the context that had originally given birth to them. 84</page><page sequence="2">Oddly enough, we never, or rarely, talked about African art or about her collection, de- spite the fact that it was all around us in her house. We talked about our children and their futures, about our various experiences as women, about our concerns with the world we live in and the people we encounter. Here- in lies, I believe, the key to understanding Kat's choice of artifacts, both for the exhibi- tion and in her collection as a whole. Out of the vastness of African art creativity, it was her concern for human beings that structured her choices, and it was the interpretation of their essence that fascinated her the most. Ulti- mately, this concern for people translated it- self into an introspective concern with self. The pieces she collected were, for her, "inter- sections of form and time." She brought her- self to a work of art "with all the known and unknown qualities" of herself. "What it is in terms of who I want to be, what I am in terms of what I will be after a lifetime of watching." For those of us fortunate enough to have been witness to Kat White's collection in her home environment, this presentation of self was very clear. The tumultuous joie de vivre, the spontaneity, the humor, the verve and color, the human condition both frail and heroic merged in a grand symphony of movement and vitality. Such was her own personal space, and, as we all do, she personalized her own space with the force of motion and per- formance to which she was content to be a spectator. Those of us who have had the fortune to partake of day-to-day life in Africa will, in the privacy of our own domains, tend to do the same. We surround ourselves, in a face-to- face dialogue, with the memory containers of past experience; African art being what is, there is always a particular vibrancy in the at- mosphere. Within the intimacy of personal, private space, one can return to touch and gaze on, again and again, the art stimulus. Kat said that her "house is a solid volume of space saturated with art. Like a presence thick as concrete are the humming and whining and singing of pictures, sculpture: standing room only." This interpretation of a personal envi- ronment honors the life within the art object itself. "Standing room only" evokes associa- tion with the theater: we participate, albeit vicariously, in the drama itself. My own review of and response to this par- ticular retrospective exhibition cannot be any- thing but subjective, colored not only by my own perspective of the African art world, by my own years of involvement with the Afri- can scene, but also by a particular kind of commitment to the nature of its presentation and by my own particular relationship with Kat White. By the same token, those inti- mately familiar with the African milieu by vir- tue of having lived in it for a short or longer time will respond quite differently from those who approach its material expression with the cool, objective perspective of the art connois- seur. And those whose focus has been on the setting within which the art form performs and unfolds, whose perspective derives from an emphasis on the experience of space, will respond more strongly and react more sensi- tively than others to a travesty of presentation out of its environmental context. The controversy over the presentation of the arts of cultures unfamiliar to the Western eye is familiar to many readers of African Arts. It has long been a subject of dispute and in- terpretation by museum directors, curators, and designers, and in"Praise Poems," the same concerns were voiced by both curator and museum designer. To be sure, much of African art is created to be viewed: its very im- agery is a language of communication. The difficulty, aside from the question of perfor- mance and kinetic quality itself, is that the spatial order and structure within which the dialogue between the art form and its viewer unfolds are not necessarily of the Western construct. Symmetry, lighting, balance and the proportions of space defined by light and shadow in the indigenous environment vary greatly from our Renaissance-based percep- tion of space. The solution for the museum's dilemma continues to elude us. In retrospect, however, it is also relevant to recall other exhibitions of the Katherine White collection, those in which she played a critical role, and to compare them with the very personal, private environment of her own museum-house. In her introduction to African Art in Motion, curated by Robert Farris Thompson at the Wight Gallery, UCLA, she wrote: "Africa is a verb to me./The vitality that comes from the ground is an awakening./The sunlight is special./These objects are alive./ They pour energy into the air./(It is) why I stay in their fallout." In staging that exhibition, Thompson attempted to honor the inherent action that a verb implies by introducing a new dimension into exhibition theory, one that brought into play the kinetic quality of the African environment and its aesthetic expression--in face of the fact that, as Pam McClusky acknowleged in curating "Praise Poems," "performances are the artistic arena most removed from the museum context." The Herculean attempt to overcome this di- lemma brings to mind a recent collection of essays by Clifford Geertz, in which he suggests that art cannot be understood by an approach that locates "aesthetic power" in "formal relations among sounds, images, volumes, themes and gestures." To study an art form (and presumably that is what mu- seum exhibitions are at least partly about) is to study a collective formation that makes con- crete "a way of experiencing" and brings "a particular cast of mind out into the world of objects, where men can look at it." To under- stand art works we must place them among the products of other modes of social activity, incorporate them into "the texture of a par- ticular pattern of life." No matter how univer- sal (and one could question this universality) the intrinsic qualities that actualize its emo- tional power may be, art is just not the same thing in different parts of Africa or the north- west coast of the United States. What Geertz suggests is not far from what Kat White her- self believed, and what she tried to express KATHERINE WHITE'S HOME, 1979. "PRAISE POEMS," SEATTLE ART MUSEUM, 1984. 85</page><page sequence="3">through her own poetry and verse about many of the pieces in the Seattle exhibition. While many of her writings may be less suc- cessful as poetry, they do convey, if nothing else, her own very intimate, subjective dialogue with the pieces. Her poetry docu- ments the process of gradual involvement with them, the process of personalization of another world. Recently a graduate student approached me about the possibility of a master's thesis that would explore the relationship between architecture and dance. Architecture, she suggested, is not "frozen music" as was once suggested, but rather frozen dance--frozen at a point in time. Just as we cannot escape our environment, so too we cannot exist without movement. In point of fact, it is motion that makes the built environment alive. Just as ar- chitectural design concepts should be gener- ated by human behavior in space, so should museum design concepts be staged to ac- commodate the motion context that honors the anthropomorphic quality of ethnographic arts. The great paradox is that the museum context itself runs counter to the essence of an art born of the marriage between ideokinesics and environmental context. In contrast to "African Art in Motion," "Praise Poems"was a connoisseur's show. Each piece, each individual work of art, sat or stood in grand isolation, visible from all sides, breathtaking to the connoisseur, the scholar, the novice, and the uninitiated alike. We all can react, albeit in different ways and along varied wave lengths-whether it be to the sheer beauty of craftsmanship, to the striking power of form, to the charming whimsy of humor, or to the richness of the impenetrable. One could argue, with equal persuasion, an approach to museum exhibition design that allows, as in this instance, each individual piece to speak for itself by creating a tabula rasa of off-white surfaces in which total contrast can create the kinetic tension for the viewer-- in which, as Pam McClusky pointed out, "the intimacy and profusion of a collector's cabinet of curios is replaced by an insistence on the visual challenge offered by each individual work of art." This visual challenge, however, is itself a Western construct. The problems attendant upon it are not un- like those a teacher faces in presenting un- familiar forms in art or architecture to a fledgl- ing student. In the study of Western art or ar- chitecture, a familiar image, firsthand experi- ence, or the collective memory supplies the background to the learning experience. In recognition of the limitations attendant upon communicating unfamiliar forms to the view- ing audience, the exhibition was organized into "galleries" or arenas, into contexts or viewing situations. With the help of two- dimensional images, in many instances photo montages taken by Kat White herself, these galleries were intellectually structured into public arenas and household courtyards, pub- lic shrines, public performances, private shrines, royal courts, and restricted perfor- mances. Unfortunately, this organization was so subtle and unobtrusive that even the most seasoned, knowledgeable visitor may have failed to get the message, despite the abun- dance of documentation accompanying each piece. Roger Downey, the art critic for Seattle Week- ly, succinctly summarized the unresolved yet critical question by headlining his review with a caption that heralded the "triumph of art over anthropology." One might paraphrase him by referring to the exhibit as the triumph of form over function, despite the structured viewing situations-the triumph of the inert setting over the volatile contents. If only the pieces stood still for us, but they did not. Indi- vidually and collectively, they seemed to burst forth through their cages of glass and plexi- glass, struggling to assert their vibrancy through distancing prison walls that subdued and restrained them. Their animation could only be an expression of the intense commit- ment to the continuity of life that underlies the African ethos, and the unfamiliar, hostile environment itself endowed them with re- newed power to continue the dialogue of in- timacy that art in context evokes for the viewer. Creating a kind of environmental dialectic of opposities in which the elegant re- straint, cool objectivity and Western, intellec- tual rationale evoked the essence of strength in African art by its very contrast may indeed have been a most fortuitous, albeit unfore- seen coup de maitre, an uriexpected providen- tial stroke.
