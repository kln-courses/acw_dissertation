<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME: GENESIS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF A POLITICO-RELIGIOUS IDEA By Cyril Toumanoff* By the end of the fifteenth century, a door was shut upon the past when Constantinople fell, and others opened on to the future with the discovery of America and the rise of Muscovite Russia. On her way toward becoming a great power, Muscovy evolved a politico religious ideology of her own which marked her coming of age and her emancipation from foreign tutelage. This ideology was grounded in the claim that Moscow was the "Third Rome" and, as such, a successor to the political and religious position both of Constantinople, the "Second Rome," and of true Rome. The literature dealing with the exposition of this idea, especially by the monk Philotheus, its literary and textual filiation, and its connection with the political realities of rising Muscovy is quite considerable.1 The purpose of this study is to trace the genealogy of the idea itself, rather than of its * The author is assistant professor of history in Georgetown University.

The third unit of any real or spurious series offers something aesthetically satisfying and dialectically final, as well as partaking of religious symbolism?something which has appealed to some con temporaries of Abbot Joachim no less than to those of Adolf Hitler. There were, however, other reasons, more particular and more pro found, why the idea that the capital of Muscovite Russia was the "Third Rome" fired the imagination of the Russians. To begin with, this theory asserted Russia's independence of Constantinople ; it, then, brought to a logical conclusion and into context with historical events the several traditions which Constantinople had transmitted to Russia ; finally, it proved a potent anodyne for her humiliations of the past. Russia, indeed, had heretofore been a spiritual client of Byzantium and?more humiliating still?a subject of the Mongol Golden Horde. But in the fifteenth century she overthrew Mongol overlordship and achieved her spiritual independence of Byzantium. The one liberation was wrought by force of arms ; the other, through the birth of an idea. The material success gave substance to the spiritual presumption, and the latter served to assuage the memory of past subjections. The potency of this ideology derived from its affirmation. Instead of denying the past, it incorporated it with the present. Exactly as the overthrow of Mongol suzerainty did not mean the end of Mongol influence in Russia, but rather signified the continuation of the Golden Horde in Muscovy with the czar as the successor to the Mongol imperial idea, so also the theory of Moscow the Third Rome was a fabric woven with Byzantine threads, and it only denied Constan tinople's supremacy by asserting Moscow's succession to it. Forming part of the Byzantine religious complex, these threads reach far back into history. It is through them that pre-Petrine Russia, informed by that complex, could claim a contact with classical antiquity?a contact that is often overlooked. The idea of Moscow the Third Rome was, indeed, a Roman heritage. Byzantium was the mediaeval survival of the eastern half of the pax romana, of the cultural syncretism of the Mediterranean world within the framework of the Roman polity. And, as Hegel noted, while in the empire's western half the barbarian invasions helped to obliterate pagan Roman traditions and to replace them with new, Christian, conceptions, the</page><page sequence="3">CYRIL T0UMAN0FF 413 Eastern Empire retained unimpaired those pre-Christian traditions.2 These, along with their ideological progeny, were subsequently trans mitted by Byzantium to its spiritual dependency of Russia. Christianity introduced in the world wholly novel principles. Obey ing the words of Our Lord "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:21 and parallel texts) and in context with His universal message, it postu lated a correlation of the spiritual and the temporal power on the basis of the primacy, independence, and universality of the spiritual. Man, according to the Christian view, belongs to two distinct societies which exist for his welfare : the spiritual society of the Church, which is of its nature one and universal, and the temporal society of the State, which may assume a variety of forms. All this makes for what can be termed Christian "societal dualism."3 This new conception did not fail to clash with the "societal monism" implied in the pagan Roman State. Found in all non-Christian com munities?and subsequently among some Christian groups as well? societal monism admits of but one society, in which the polity is the raison d'?tre of both religion and man. If unchecked, societal monism conduces to the absolute State, and, further still, to the fusion of the spiritual and the temporal and to the divinization of the latter power. As the Roman emperors between Augustus and Diocletian tended to transform their position of chief magistrates into that of Hellenistic monarchs, the local Roman aspect of this extreme monism, that of the deifying State, was enhanced by the corresponding Hellenistic aspect of the divine king. Thus the Roman Empire presumed to subordinate to the temporal, not only the spiritual, but also?no matter how diluted the notion of it?the divine.4 2Philosophy of History, Part III, Chap, iii, Sec. 3, trans.

When it flared up, it took the form, inevitable in the circumstances, of the persecutions to which, between Nero and Licinius, the Church was sporadically subjected.5 In the face of such trials, however, the Church refused to accept a simpliste solution. Her attitude was marked by a polarity born of the distinction drawn between the "Babylonian" iniquity of monism (Apoc; cf. i" Peter 5:13) and the lawfulness and dignity of civil authority as derived from God (Rom. 13:1-17 ; / Tim. 2:2 ; Titus 3 :l-2 ; / Peter 2:13-17 ; stemming, of course, from John 19:11 and Matt. 22:21).6 Conn., 1931) ; U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, Staat und Gesellschaft der Griechen (Leipzig, 1923) ; G.

The Christian objection to monism is double: (1) because it denies the primacy of the spiritual, determining the greater by the less, and (2) because it denies societal dualism and, in its extreme form, destroys it. Most usu ally monism implies that in the one society the spiritual is subordinate to the temporal. Its converse is genuine theocracy (cf. infra, n. 14), such as is found in Tibet; the supremacy of the spiritual in it is, however, only apparent: not being universal, the spiritual-temporal complex is determined by national political factors. 5 For the Persecutions see, e.g., J. Zeiller, in A. Fliehe and V. Martin, Histoire de l'Eglise, I (Paris, 1946), 289-297, 299-320; II (Paris, 1948), 113-122, 145-160, 457-479.?Christian religious exclusiveness (and consequent refusal to participate in the Emperor-worship) was the more apparent reason for the Persecutions; but, then, Jewish exclusiveness (and refusal) was tol erated. Judaism, too, was monistic: a religion confined to, i.e., determinable by, a nation, in which the spiritual and the temporal were often nearly fused in a theocracy. By its very nature, however, Jewish monism was precluded from attaining the extreme form of the divinized State. 0 Thus, St. Paul shows a certain pride in being a Roman citizen (Acts, 22:25-27) and a respect for the Empire's law and order (Acts, 16:37, 38 ; 25:16). The Church refused to compromise with the Emperor-worship, but she prayed for the Emperors, as she has since done for any lawful civil authority; cf. Leclerq, art. cit., col. 2753-2755 ; G. Tellenbach, R?mischer und christlicher Reichsgedanke in der Liturgie des fr?hen Mittelalters (Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philos.-hist. Kl. [1934-1935], i) ;</page><page sequence="5">CYRIL T0UMAN0FF 415 Then?we know?the situation changed abruptly. Constantine granted toleration to Christianity ; later, Theodosius made Catholicism the established religion of the State. The Roman State, the persecutor of yesterday, was thrust into its former victim's fold. To many Christians it seemed that the empire had been predestined to pave the way for the Church and now to become her temporal protector? Babylon in the service of Sion.7 Yet abrupt changes are seldom thor ough changes. The conversion of individuals, imperfect in many cases?and of this the clinic case of the "Thirteenth Apostle" himself is almost an archetype?did not transform the pagan essence of that State. And that essence still commanded the adherence of the great numbers of the imperfectly Christianized. This continuance of societal monism in the Christianized empire shattered the roseate dream of a harmonious, dualistic, co-existence of Church and State. So, after a moment of the Church's stunned and hopeful silence under the first Christian emperor, the old struggle of Christian dualism and pagan monism was resumed.8 L.

Ver?ffentlichungen d. Sektion f?r Rechts- u. Sozialwiss., LXXV [Paderborn, 1937]). The Church's injunc tion to pray for and to obey lawful civil authority begins with Sts. Peter, Paul, and Clement I (Ep. ad Corinth., 61: 1 ). The hope of transforming the pax romana into a pax Christiana was, no doubt, the reason why some ante Nicene Fathers interpreted the Adversary's "withholder" (Tb Kariyov, o KaT x&lt;ov) of 77 Thess. 2:6-7 as the Roman Empire (cf. O. Buzy and A. Brunot, "Thessaloniciens (Epitres aux)," Dictionnaire de th?ologie catholique, XV [1946], 600-607.?There is no opposition between the above two attitudes of the Church (so Str?mooukhofr, Moscow the Third Rome, p. 84), but merely a fine distinction (for which see also C. Dawson, in A Monument to Saint Augustine [New York, 1930], pp. 24-25) between Rome's two faces: the "Beast" and the pax romana. 7 Cf. E. Gilson's Foreword to Saint Augustine: The City of God, trans.

One was the old repulsion of the Christian and the pagan tradition ; the other, the novel attempt to conciliate them. This trend of appeasement (as we may call it) accepted the pagan imperial inheritance and strove to veneer it with a Christian coating.10 These pathetic attempts to conciliate the irreconcilable make us realize, not without an admixture of pity, to what an extent the Byzantines found themselves helpless before the temptation of choosing the road of wiliness" (Setton, p. 54) must have contributed to the Church's?New Israel's? momentary silence at the time when the failure of the expected harmonious symbiosis of Babylon and Jerusalem was beginning to be obvious. The Church's awakening to the dangers of the imperfectly-converted imperium can hardly be taken to signify that "the sacerdotium was elevated to a higher dignity than the imperium towards the last quarter of the fourth century" (Setton, p. 108). This hierarchy of values stems from that implied in the juxtaposition of "God" and "Caesar" in Matt. 22:21. 9 For this survival see N. H. Baynes, The Hellenistic Civilization and East Rome (London, 1946) ; "Eusebius and the Christian Empire," Annuaire de l'Institut de philologie et d'histoire orientales, II (M?langes Bidez), 1934, 13-18; L.

Stein, "Introduction ? l'histoire et aux institutions byzantines," Traditio, VII (1949-1951), 96, 97, 138-139. 10 The manifestations of the two opposite currents in Byzantine Christianity will be found in M. Jugie, Le schisme byzantin (Paris, 1941), Chaps. I and II, pp. 3-100. The difference between them was symptomized by the contrast between St. Augustine and Eusebius of Caesarea; cf. F. E. Cranz, "De Civitate Dei, XV, 2, and Augustine's Idea of the Christian Society," Speculum, XXV (1950), esp. p. 221. To the appeasement trend the fiasco of the attempted Babylon-Jerusalem symbiosis was inadmissible; to them, in fact, surviving Babylon was New Israel.

Grabar, "L'art religieux et l'empire byzantin ? l'?poque des Mac?doniens," Annuaire de VEcole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, 1939-1940, p. 35; cf. the so-called "Letter of Photius to Zacharias of Armenia," ed.

The Roman imperial inheritance of societal monism, when projected into a Christian society, affected the correlation of the spiritual and the temporal in a way utterly at variance with Christian principles. Of this anomalous correlation, "caesaropapism" is still the best descrip tion. The term has been defined as the tendency to determine the spiritual by the temporal j11 thus understood, it can successfully with stand the recent attempts to dismiss it.12 At all events, few will deny that the tendency denoted by that term was endemic in Byzantine society; and that the emperors, who embodied the monistic temporal power, acted, de facto if not always de jure, as heads of the Church in their realm. Byzantine religious history is replete with incessant imperial exercise of the purely papal functions of the supreme ruler, teacher, and center of unity in Byzantine Christianity.13 In a word, Caesar, once the pontijex maximus, now would be pope. The fusion of the two powers was thus the logical culmination of the tendency to determine the spiritual by the temporal; in recent literature it has been rather euphemistically designated as "theoc 11 Toumanoff, Caesar o papism, pp. 213-215. 12 The problem of caesaropapism and of its negation is dealt with in some detail in my Christian Caucasia, ? 6-7. 13 The recent literature on this subject is discussed in F.

This is a distinction seldom made in the literature of the subject.</page><page sequence="8">418 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME racy."14 Another extreme form of societal monism, the divinization of the State, also formed part of the Romano-Hellenistic tradition received by the Byzantines. Quite obviously, the Christianized temporal power could no longer openly assert its divinity, yet it did so covertly, under claims to an especially sacred character; to base, however, such claims on the Christian teaching regarding the origin and dignity of all civil authority was a flagrant non sequitur.15 Like wise, the brief apparent co-extension of empire and Christendom 14 Cf., e.g., Medlin, Moscow and East Rome, esp. pp. 24, 30 ("theocracy, in which the secular authority remained [rests] supreme") ; A. Schmemann, "La th?ocratie byzantine et l'Eglise orthodoxe," Dieu Vivant, XXV (1953), 35-53, where "theocracy," conceived as the monistic fusion of Church and Empire, is distinguished from "caesaropapism," taken to imply Caesar's absolute rule of the spiritual. As has been seen, the fact of his determining that monistic whole is enough. All things considered, it is a sign of caesaropapism's extraordinary vitality that a surrender of God's things to Caesar should in our own days be called "theocracy." 15 The non sequitur of the Byzantine appeasement current has survived to this day in much modern scholarship. It consists basically in a failure to make the necessary distinction between the Christian and the monistic point of view and in the consequent endeavor to represent the Fathers of the Church as Byzantine monists. It manifests itself in several ways: (1) Grounding monistic conclusions in the above Christian doctrine of political authority as derived ultimately from God (cf., e.g., Rommen, The State in Catholic Thought, pp. 220-222, 225-228, 372-373, 421-427, 428-429, etc.) or in that of the Catholic State's duty to aid and defend religion (cf. ibid., pp. 366-368). A classic example of this in the past is the Constantinopolitan patriarch Anthony IV's teaching, on the basis of / Peter 2:17, that the unique and "cosmocratic" Byzantine Emperor was as necessary for the Christians as the Church (infra, n. 34). In the same strain, today, it is, for instance, surely forcing to a rather ludicrous degree the words attributed to Chrysostom, commenting on, and in the tradition of, the above and similar scriptural texts, to hold them "to justify the Byzantine imperial government as a part of the divine plan for the universe" (M. Anastos, "Political Theory in the Lives of the Slavic Saints Constantine and Methodius," Harvard Slavic Studies, II [1954], 35-36). Anthony IV, to be sure, was aided by a meso-Byzantine titulary evolution in his interpretation of the Prima Petri's Tov ?amkia as referring exclusively to the Roman Emperors and their Byzan tine successors. But it is somewhat astonishing that this Byzantine play on words should have retained its attraction to our own day. Thus, we find the kingly dignity, in terms of which the Fathers explained God or referred to Him, treated as specifically imperial dignity, and have definite conclusions drawn therefrom (as, e.g., in Setton, Christian Attitude) ; else we find it regarded as implying a special relationship between God and the Roman Emperor (as, e.g., in Anastos, pp. 31-32). What is overlooked here is (a) that in the Gospels</page><page sequence="9">CYRIL TOUMANOFF 419 and ecclesiastical reliance on imperial support were exploited for regarding the empire as the necessary shell of the Church. At the same time, the quite orthodox theory of the predestined role the empire might have played in preparing the advent of Christianity was understood to imply its divinely instituted position of a coequal and God is constantly compared to a king and Our Lord admits His own royal dignity in Luke 23:2-3; John 18:37 (the word is ?cunkeo? etc.) without thereby suggesting any connection, special or other, with the Roman Empire (the Emperor?ironically?is always Ka?aap, not ?amkevs'&gt; Matt. 22:17, 21; Mark 12:14, 16, 17; Luke 2:1; 3:1; 20:22, 24, 25; 23:2; John 19:12, 15), and (b) that, prior to the Emperor Heraclius (A.D. 629), the word ?ooxAcvc regularly signified "king" and was, thus, used of various monarchs, as well as, unofficially in the Hellenistic East, of the Emperor; in the fifth century the former use indeed tended to become restricted (so far as barbarians were concerned: Proco pius, e.g., uses it reluctantly for the Goth kings or replaces it by ?y?; Hist, of the Wars, V, 1.26; VI, 14.38; but not with regard to kings of ancient civilized States, like Armenia or Iberia, still always ?amXets) and in the seventh century came to an end, ?aaiXev's becoming, instead of avTOKparmp, the official trans lation of imperator; cf. G. Ostrogorsky, Geschichte des byzantinischen Staates (Munich, 1952), p. 86; Br?hier, Institutions, pp. 48-50; Treitinger, Kaiser u.Reichsidee, p. 186; Leclercq, art. cit., col. 2757-2764. It is, therefore, rather difficult to suppose the apostolic and patristic use of the word to have been primarily inspired, not by its scriptural associations and indeed its normal use, but by a titular tendency within the Byzantine State which reached its full development only in the seventh century.?(2) Postulating equal evidence value, so far as the inherence of the monistic ideology is concerned, both for unmistakable statements of that ideology, such as pass like a red thread through Byzantine history from Eusebius of Caesarea to Anthony IV (cf. infra, n. 16), and for isolated words: official terms which may or may not have been used with that ideology in view: meaningfully by its adherents or as a mere form by its opponents. Official terms, like divus, were indeed becoming empty formulae of respectful mention (Leclercq, "Adoration," Dict.d'Arch.chr?t.et de Lit., I [1924], 541) ; and a list of them taken out of context (as, e.g., of those used in councils, cf. Anastos, p. 29, nn. 40, 41) is hardly as significant as the one expression: 0c?? cy/c?a/uos, used of the Emperor by Theophylact of Achrida (f c. 1108) in a private letter (Patr. Graeca, CXXVI, 516) or the doctrine of Macarius of Ancyra (XVth c.) that Our Lord placed His Church in the Emperor's keeping (On the Errors of the Latins, ed. Dositheus in T?jxos KaraWayrj? [Jassy, 1692] pp. 194-195).?(3) Overlooking or minimizing (thanks to the above) the struggle between Christianity and monism that went on?the very dynamic of Byzantinism?while, prior to becoming an overtly monistic, temporally-determined body, Byzantine Christianity was in formal and organic union with the supra-temporal and dualistic body of the Catholic Church; cf. my review of Medlin, Journ. Mod. Hist., XXV, 419-420; Christian Caucasia, ? 6.</page><page sequence="10">420 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME coeval partner of the Church, a theophanic States?Babylon camou flaged as Jerusalem.16 Finally, even the pagan cult of Caesar, sancti 16 Br?hier, Institutions, Bk.

Baynes, Eusebius and the Christian Empire; Peterson, Monotheis mus, pp. 49-147; H. G. Opitz, "Euseb von C?sarea als Theologe," Zeitschrift f?r NTliche Wissenschaft, XXXIV (1935) ; H.

Dei, XV, 2; "Kingdom and Polity in Eusebius of Caesarea," Harvard Theological Review, XLV (1952) ; Setton, Christian Attitude, pp. 40-56. Constantine VII's Ceremonial Book and like documents showed the manifestations of this ideology; in its context the meaningfulness of various ceremonial formulae can be determined (cf. supra, n. 15). It was, at bottom, an expression of the Greek, and in fact of the all too human, tendency to determine the greater by the less?be it anthropomorphism or caesaropapism? to consider the Kingdom of God as circumscribed by the microcosm of the "unique" Roman Empire (which, by the way, was, even before Constantine, outspread, in fact no less than in intention, by the Church). It was, too, the road of least resistance to ignore the failure of the Israel-Babylon symbiosis, to consider Babylon Jerusalem, and to overlook what Origen had foreseen, namely, that "la relation de l'Eglise et de la Cit? temporelle ne peut jamais ?tre con?ue comme l'harmonie de deux soci?t?s juxtapos?es... mais comme la tension dramatique de deux ?poques successives de l'histoire totale" (J. Dani?lou, Essai sur le myst?re de l'histoire [Paris, 1953], p. 23). This harmony ought to be striven for, but it cannot be taken for granted. Finally, in justifying monotheism before the pagans by an argument from monarchy, Eusebius failed to see that a complete unity of the world can be achieved only eschatologically and that, until then, it is only within the Church, spiritually, that the world can be one (ibid., pp. 57-58). History proved him wrong. Borrowing Fr. Dani?lou's language (cf. pp. 49-60; Salvation of the Nations, trans. A. Bouchard [New York, 1950], chap. IV), it can be said that in attaching Christianity to a polity Eusebius and the Byzantine monists, whom he provided with a formu lated ideology, caused a reversal to the divisive "economy of the angels" away from the catholic reign of Christ, to Babel away from Pentecost, and that they did not complete the spirituality of the Incarnation by accepting it as a way to the Transfiguration. The fruit of this, suggesting an oblivion of Original Sin, was the Byzantine theophanic complacency, glimpses of which can now be caught in the Russian attitude to the "outside" (cf., e.g., the late Prince N. Trubetzkoy's generalizations in comparing Catholic and Byzantine Christianity ; "Introduction to the History of Old Russian Literature," Harvard Slavic Studies, II, 95-98, where we are told, inter alia, that "while Occidental Christianity became an international or, rather, supranational organization, Eastern Christianity always remained national" [italics mine]?and this in the face of Matt. 28:19; Mark 13:10; Luke 24:47; Gal. 3:28 etc.!).</page><page sequence="11">CYRIL TOUMANOFF 421 palatii ritus, was retained continuing?a veritable liturgy of the palace ?parallel with Christian worship.17 Still another pre-Christian heritage came to play a part in the psychology of the Byzantines. It was their conception of universality. Now, the universality of the Catholic Church is objective: the uni versal?cosmic?character of Christianity concerns the entire world, "all nations." On the other hand, the universality of the Roman Empire can be described as subjective.18 The historical myopy of the classical world has been pointed out by Spengler.19 The same myopy, or subjectivism, marked also the classical concept of the universe. The Hellenistic oikoumene tended to designate solely the world of Hellenism; likewise, the Roman Empire was thought of by its denizens as containing the world, to be the orbis terrarum, although the existence of polities and peoples outside it was well known to them.20 While for a brief moment the empire and Christendom seemed co-extensive, the difference between the two conceptions was not apparent. But soon both coincidences ceased.21 The Church centered at Rome kept the Christian objective idea; the empire centered at Constantinople retained the pre-Christian, subjective one. Conse quently, for the Byzantines their empire was the universe : oikoumene or ta oikoumena, all outside being the desert of barbarism.22 With the 17 Br?hier, Institutions, pp. 53-88 ; Treitinger, Kaiser- u.

It was probably in connection with this Byzantine microcosmic psychology that the word katholikos tended to mean, in Byzantine society, also that which is part of a whole.23 From the meeting of all this pagan heritage with the tension between the two imperial cities sprang the theory of "Neo-Romism." Long after Constantinople had become the seat of Caesar, Rome still enjoyed the prestige of the matrix of the empire. Yet Constantinople, the basilis polis, claimed to be the image and successor of the older city?a new or Second Rome.24 But Rome had two different aspects : the older center of the imperium was at the same time the See of Peter and the only center of the sacerdotium. Constantinople was envious of both aspects, and, true to her inherent caesaropapism, con fused them. Accordingly, the Byzantines never tired of insinuating that, because it was the seat of Caesar, the see of the "New Rome" ought to rank next to papal Rome, or?this was the next step?even to supersede her in the headship of the Church.25 The spiritual, thus, was fully determined by the temporal. 23 Cf. Br?hier, La civilisation byzantine (Paris, 1950), p. 421. To state with C. Swietlinski (La conception sociologique de Voecum?nicit? dans la pens?e religieuse russe contemporaine [Paris, 1938], p. 38, cited by B. Tatakis, La philosophie byzantine, in E.

Thus, e.g., one should be able to distinguish between Eusebius' description of the Emperor in terms of Godhead (Setton, p. 48) and his and Athanasius' explaining God in terms of kingship (ibid., pp. 47, 71-73). The non sequitur of deducing attitude 3 from 1 and 2 has been com mented upon (supra, n. 15). It is, also, decidedly seeing things out of their historical context to treat the above formulae as instances of obsequiousness (cf.

In the course of it, Caesar, aided by the appeasement cur rent in Byzantine Christianity, caused many a breach between his subjects and the Apostolic See which, save for a century and a half between Justinian I and Justinian II, was increasingly independent of the imperial control. Always healed at first, and always on the Roman terms, these periods of separation from the Catholic com munion, nevertheless, ultimately bore their fruit. After the Icono clastic epoch, Byzantine Christianity was being noticeably de-Cathol icized. While the appeasement party (we may call them the Politiques) remained unchanged, the Catholic party, the current from Athanasius to Theodore of Studion, was degenerating into a merely clericalist one, represented by men like Ignatius or Cerularius.27 The de-Catholicizing of Byzantine Christianity under the impact of the pre-Christian monistic traditions is, perhaps, best exemplified by the formation of a new ecclesiological conception, which was utterly at variance with that previously held by all Christians, and to which now all the Byzantines had come to adhere. The belief in the Catholic Church gave way, among them, to one in the Imperial Church, that is to say, the empire-determined?Caesar-determined?Church, cir cumscribed by the microcosm of the Byzantine subjective universe. Within that body, the will of Caesar, rather than the voice of Peter, had become the touchstone of orthodoxy. This conception, always, though at first vaguely, present in the caesaropapist circles, ripened and gained in general acceptance between Photius and Cerularius.28 27 Cf. Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 1-186 ; Bardy, in Fliche-Martin, III, 97-176; J.-R. Palanque, ibid., pp. 237-296; Bardy, in Fliche-Martin, IV, 163 240, 271-320; L.

Dvornik, The Photian Schism: History and Legend (Cam bridge, 1948) is the best known work, see D?lger-Schneider, Byzans, pp. 134 138. A discussion in connection with the "parties" in Byzantine Christianity will be found in my Christian Caucasia, n. 27.?Byzantine history is often written nowadays as though its Catholic phase had never existed and societal monism had, without a struggle, been triumphant from the start. The non sequitur noted supra, nn. 15, 26, has helped considerably to create this impression. 28 To this ripening, the Iconoclastic controversy undoubtedly contributed. It has been shown by G. Ladner in his admirable article "Origin and Significance of the Byzantine Iconoclastic Controversy," Mediaeval Studies, II (1940), 127</page><page sequence="15">CYRIL T0UMAN0FF 425 Simultaneously, the Byzantine concept of Catholicity was gradually impaired by "microcosmism" ; and the doctrine of papal authority obscured by the newly risen Byzantine theory of the divinely instituted patriarchal pentarchy as the government of the Church.29 The so called Cerularian Schism of 1054 was, consequently, not so much a rupture as a preclusion of further reunions between what had now definitely assumed the shape of an Imperial Church, on the one hand, and the Church Universal on the other. The fruit was ripe, Cerularius merely shook the tree.30 To this final separation various other factors, psychological, cultural, political, human, had also contributed; this study is concerned solely with the role of the pre-Christian imperial tradition of societal monism. With the formation of the Byzantine establishment, a new phase was opened in the history of the Eastern Empire. The Catholic phase was over, the "Greek-Orthodox" one w7as ushered in. It signified the end of the age-old struggle between the cosmic and dualistic Christian tradition and the microcosmic and monistic one, retained from pre-Christian times.31 The raison d'?tre of Greek-Orthodoxy was the repudiation of the papacy as a safeguard of the primacy, inde 149, that the exaggerations of the Byzantine Iconodules were no less divergent from the Catholic position than the negations of the Iconoclasts. These exag gerations made it easy to conceive of the Byzantine microcosm?in the truly Eusebian tradition?as the necessary image, or icon, of Heaven, and one rela tively identical with it. Obviously, in this "living icon" of Byzantinism there was no place for the Papacy and Catholicity: both were relegated to the eprjfios or ao?K7)To&lt;? of those "outside." 29Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 32-39; T.

The mediaeval unity was not one of a Church circumscribed by a subjectively oecumenical empire, but one of an empire (co-existing with a number of theoretically vassal States), called into being by the Church as a counterpoise to Byzantium, because</page><page sequence="16">426 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME pendence, and true universality of the spiritual. The bishop of the "New Rome" might, in the new conditions, congratulate himself with having superseded the pope in his own microcosmic oikoumeneB2 and with being occasionally treated as a diarch by Caesar,33 but it seemingly free from the "Babylonian" heritage, and invited by her to share her objective universality. Whatever the opinions of the monistic and Byzan tinesque "fringe" of Catholic Christianity (ranging from the Norman Anonymous or the Tractatus Eboricenses, a Frederick II or a Marsilius of Padua to milder Imperialists and Regalists), historically, the "sacredness" of the Holy Roman Empire and other Catholic monarchies owed its raison d'?tre to their associa tion with the Church (though it was occasionally argued in monistic terms), and not to an uninterrupted pre-Christian tradition (occasionally cast in Christian terms). In any case, this resurgence of "Babylon" was never accepted by the Church, the existence of whose Center, the Papacy, constituted a guarantee of the primacy, independence, and universality of the spiritual and an obstacle to all attempts to reduce her to a temporally-determined body. As for some of the "extreme" Papalist writers (always to be distinguished from the magisterium of the Church), such as Aegidius Romanus or Alvarus Pelagius, while advocating a universal "meta-political" overlordship, a super-eminent dominium, of the Roman Pontiff?and of this the doctrine of the primacy of the spiritual can admit, as it cannot of caesaropapism (cf. supra, n. 4)?they did not, it seems, in any sense depart from dualism towards a monistic solution by suggesting, e.g., the replacement of temporal rulers by ecclesiastics. This problem has been recently treated in The Review of Politics, IX (1947) : G. Ladner, "Aspects of Mediaeval Thought on Church and State," pp. 403-422, esp. 406-410; A.-H. Chroust, "The Corporate Idea and the Body Politic in the Middle Ages," pp. 423-452, esp. 433-436. 32 Weakened by Monophysitism and Islam, the remaining Catholic patriarch ates of the Byzantine world?Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem?gradually fell under the sway of Constantinople and ultimately, though (it seems) not immediately, followed the Cerularian separation from Rome. In the last phase of the Empire's existence, Constantinople indeed lost control over certain newly formed phyletk independencies (infra, n. 42), but she became, in the thirteenth century, the unquestioned mistress of the older patriarchates of the East, to the point of replacing their ancient liturgies (Alexandrian and Antiochene) by the Byzantine rite; cf. Br?hier, Institutions, pp. 456-460, 461-476; and, for the recent literature, D?lger-Schneider, Byzanz, pp. 127-130. 33 This "diarchy," postulated in the Basilid documents stemming from the Epanagoge (V. Sokol'skij, "O xaraktere i znacenii Epanagogi," Vizantijskij Vremennik, I [1894] ; G. Vernadsky, "Vizantijskie ucenija o vlasti car ja i patriarxa," Recueil Kondakov [1926] ; "Die kirchlich-politische Lehre der Epanagoge und ihr Einfluss auf das russische Leben im XVIIJahrhundert," Byzantinisch-neugriechische Jahrb?cher, VI [1928] ; Mediin, Moscow and East Rome, pp. 25-28) is vitiated by the subsequent Byzantine doctrine on the subject, as revealed in canon law and imperial practice (infra, n. 34, Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 413-416, 403-406). The "diarchy" was a theoretical recompense for a very real subjection.</page><page sequence="17">CYRIL TOUMANOFF 427 was Caesar who had acquired, de jure now, most of the papal func tions. The duties of ruling, teaching, and unifying were officially rendered to Caesar by the empire-determined Church, as witness the concord between the doctrines of great Byzantine canonists and imperial claims and practice.34 For obvious technical reasons, how ever, the duty of sanctifying remained within the clergy's competence.35 Church and State formed now one corpus politicum mysticum,SQ a "theocracy" of which the temporal power was the determining factor and in which the monistic surrender to it of the spiritual was graced with the euphemism of symphonia?1 This continuation of imperial 34 The Emperor was placed above all canons and laws and held the supreme power of jurisdiction in the Greek Orthodox Church (Balsamon, In can. 16 Carth., Patr.Graeca, CXXXVIII, 93; In can. 38 Trull., ib. CXXXVIII, 644) ; he was greater than the Patriarch, being in charge of both men's souls and bodies and not, like the latter, of their souls only (idem, Med?tala sive responsa de pair. Privil., ibid., col. 1017) ; he was held to possess the supreme teaching authority, being the Supreme Doctor of the Church, and he united in his person all the privileges of the pontificate, save Holy Orders (Chomatenus [Chomatianus], Resp. ad Const. Cabasilam, in J. Leunclavius, Jus graeco-rom. [Frankfort, 1596], V, 317) ; he was, finally, declared to be as essential for the Christians as the Church herself (Anthony IV of Constantinople to Basil I of Muscovy, in Mikloschich and M?ller, Acta et dipl. gr. medii aevi, II [Vienna, 1862], 191). Cf. Br?hier, Institutions, pp. 430-442; Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 403-406; also supra, n. 13. All this, it must be owned, reduced the ecclesiastical "diarch" to the position of a mere secretary for sacramental affairs. Thus Byzantine canon law rendered de jure to Caesar, after the final break with Rome, those of God's things which he had from the start endeavored to make de facto his own. It is symptomatic of the difference observed supra, n. 31, that in Byzantium it was the canonists and the Church leaders who propounded the high "Imperialist" doctrines. 35 Cf. L. Br?hier, 'Icpcv? /cat ?aaikevs, M?morial L. Petit (= Archives de l'Orient chr?tien, I [1948]), pp. 4-45. 36 This phrase is used here not in the Suarezian sense indicative of an analogy between the temporal and the spiritual society, but as an indication of the fact that the Empire arrogated to itself the spiritual, and indeed supernatural, character of the Church; for this, see Treitinger, Kaiser- u. Reichsidee, pp. 158 160 ; Br?hier, Institutions, p. 431. 37 The denial of the inherence of caesaropapism in Byzantium, at any rate in the "mediaeval," i.e., post-Iconoclastic, period, a protagonist of which has been G. Ostrogorsky ("Otnosenie cerkvi i gosudarstva v Vizantii," Seminarium Kondakovianum, IV [1931] ; Gesch.d.byz.Staates, p. 192, n.2), is based on several misconceptions which I took the liberty of pointing out in Caesaropapism, pp. 230-222. How the ovfi&lt;f&gt;o&gt;via postulated by the "diarchy" corresponded to reality has already been seen. The cessation of strife was due to the surrender of the spiritual to the temporal in Byzantine society, a triumph of caesaropapism ; cf. my Christian Caucasia, ? 7.</page><page sequence="18">428 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME Rome was, whatever its protestations, in no sense Christian Rome's successor.38 Before the fall of the Eastern Empire, its societal monism showed a change of emphasis. The once multi-national policy was in its final phase dwindling till it became a Greek city-state, and, with the imperial structure on the verge of destruction, Greek nationality appeared to be the only vital element in it.39 Accordingly, the temporal element, which continued monistically to control the spiritual, did so less in its political aspect now, and increasingly more in its ethnic, its phyletic, aspect. In other words, the local Imperial Church, which had been formed through a secession from the Church Universal, now become a local national Church. This is the reason why all the attempts of the Palaeologan emperors and of the intellectual ?lite supporting them to effect a reunion with the Apostolic See were met with the nation's rejection.40 Monistic Byzantine Orthodoxy was no longer the emperor's thing : it was a phyletic thing. One secession, however, had in the meantime begotten others. The Byzantine subjec tive notion of universality, "microcosmism," was heavy with frag mentation, since every geo-political unit might conceive of itself as a microcosmic universe. In conjunction with caesaropapism, each such unit might regard itself as a church-embracing polity. The emphasis on the phyletic aspect of societal monism and nationalization of the Imperial Church, when meeting with the separatist tendencies of the rapidly dwindling empire's "pneumatic" children,41 further con 38 A curious deviation from the persistent Byzantine claims to Roman con tinuity (imperial and Christian) is found in the tradition represented by Andrew of Caesarea, in the sixth-seventh century, and by Arethas of Caesarea and the Slavic biographer of St. Cyril (Constantine), in the ninth, stressing the differ ence between the pagan Empire and the Christian one of Constantine which succeeded it ; cf. Anastos, Political Theory, p. 18. 39 For the rise of Hellenic nationalism in the Balkanized "New Rome" see A. Vasiliev, History of the Byzantine Empire (Madison, 1953), pp. 582, 687; for its connection with the intellectual development culminating in the neo paganism of Pletho, Tatakis, Philosophie byzantine, pp. 228-306. In this context, the adjective "Hellene" tended to replace the imperial one of "Roman"; for an early instance (during the Nicaean interlude), cf. D. Geanakoplos, in Traditio, IX (1953), 422 n. 13; also Tatakis, p. 230; Br?hier, Civilisation byz., p. 329. 40 These attempts are discussed in Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 247-270. 41 Attempts to reconcile the Byzantine transcription of monotheism in terms of the unique Empire (cf. supra, nn. 15, 16) with the existence of other Christian States, after the brief?and apparent?coextension of Empire and</page><page sequence="19">CYRIL TOUMANOFF 429 tributed to the splitting of imperial Christendom into a number of phyletic churches.42 These, then, were the threads of pagan Romano-Hellenistic tradition which Byzantium handed down to Russia. It remains to examine the fabric which Russia wove with them. Byzantium was the dominant cultural, political, and economic factor on the horizon of the proto Christendom had ceased, resulted in emphasizing the legal fiction of the Emperor as father or eldest brother in the spiritual, "pneumatic," family of Christian princes : D?lger, "Die 'Familie der K?nige' im Mittelalter," "Die mittelalterliche 'Familie der F?rsten und V?lker' und der Bulgarenherrscher," Byzanz u. die europ. Staatenwelt, pp. 34-69, 159-182; A. Grabar, "God and the 'Family of Princes' presided over by the Byzantine Emperor," Harvard Slavic Studies, II, 117-123. 42 All this was, at bottom, a reversal from the psychology of pagan Rome's state religion, which had informed Byzantine Christianity, back to the anterior one of tribal cults. Even before this phyletism affected the Empire itself, it had, in conjunction with "microcosmism" and caesaropapism, caused the separa tion from it of some dependencies ; cf. the Bulgarian venture in the ninth century (cf. infra, n. 56), and, earlier still, in connection with dogmas at variance with the faith of the then Catholic Emperor, the Monophysite secession (the role of this combined Byzantine inheritance in the formation of the Armenian Church is analyzed in my Christian Caucasia). Now, with the Church of the shrinking Empire becoming a Greek Church, or even occasionally several Greek Churches (Constantinople-Nicaea, Trebizond, Epirus), the Georgian, Balkan, and Russian ecclesiastical formations gradually, and in varying degrees, tended away from Byzantine allegiance; cf. Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, pp. 271-273; Br?hier, Institutions, pp. 470-472. Constantinople, however, was recompensed somewhat by her increased control over the Melkites (cf. supra, n. 32). Several factors remained, nevertheless, to hold together the various fragments of the Imperial Church within what may be regarded as its new manifestation: the Greek Orthodox communion. These were (1) the common Byzantine cultural tradition (including the Byzantine rite) ; (2) the common monistic raison d'?tre (imply ing a rejection of the primacy of the spiritual) ; and (3) "microcosmism" expressed, in space, by a rejection of Catholicity and, in time, by a negation of further development (arrested development). The Greek-Orthodox attitude towards the question of authority in the Church is a good illustration of the largely negative character of this unity. In the Imperial Church, the Papal powers were transferred to the Emperor (supra, n. 34) ; but between the rise of phyletism and the fall of the Empire, the doctrine of Pontifical Caesar as the seat of authority was wrecked. Under the Turks, the Constantinopolitan patriarch indeed attempted to gather Caesar's inheritance, but his claims could be enforced only by the might of Ottoman arms (Jugie, pp. 272-273). Outside the Sultan's realm (except, at first, in Russia), he was allowed merely a vague primacy among the heads of the other phyletic Churches.

When Kievan Russia emerged out of the chaos of Slavic tribes, Ural-Altaic conquerors, and Scandinavian adventurers, her religion and culture were received from the Byzantines.43 True enough, the conversion of the Russians took place prior to Constanti nople's definitive separation from the See of Peter?and history has preserved traces of early-Russian Catholicism?but that link had become, we have seen, increasingly tenuous long before 1054?merely a formal bridge over the material chasm.44 The Russian polity, however, was founded by Norsemen. And so, in the Kievan period, Byzantine elements among the Russians were counterbalanced by western European. The Rurikid dynasty, reign ing in the princedoms into which the Russian territory was then divided, was a part of the western family of ruling houses. This fact, no occasional Byzantine matrimonial alliance could, for all its prestige, outweigh. A monarch like Vladimir II Monomakh (1113-1125) suffice it to recall here the Libellus of St. Hormisdas, of 519), Greek-Orthodoxy can offer no official and generally received doctrine on authority in the Church ; Spacil, Conceptus et doctrina de Ecclesia; cf. Dom F. Mercenier's review in Stoudion, II, 4 (1925), 121-125; Jugie, pp. 325-398.?The term "phyletism" is due to Constantinople herself, when, in 1872, she, together with Alexandria, Antioch, and Cyprus, condemned the Bulgarian Church for the very thing which had contributed to her own separation from Rome (cf. Jugie, pp. 290 292). With "Caesar" taken to signify the State, and not the temporal element in general, phyletic caesaropapism has recently been aptly termed "ethno papism"; cf. S. Tyszkiewicz, S.J., "Le visage de l'orthodoxie," Nouvelle revue th?ologique, LXXVI, 6, 613-614. 43 The most recent treatment of Russian pre-history and early history will be found in G. Vernadsky, Ancient Russia (G. Vernadsky and M. Karpovich, A History of Russia, I [New Haven, 1946] ) and Kievan Russia (ibid., II [New Haven, 1948]). In the latter work, the treatment of the conversion of Russia (pp. 48-70, esp. 61-62) stands in need of revision: there is hardly any reason for attempting to justify the apocryphal story of St. Vladimir's "choosing of the faith" interpolated into the narrative of the Primary Chronicle; for this, see E.

On the other hand, the Church was in Russia the center of Byzan tine cultural and political influence. Whatever its original juridical status?there are at least five different theories about this?the Kievan Church became, despite occasional recalcitrance, a dependency of the Constantinopolitan patriarchate.45 That, from the Byzantine point of view, entailed Russian political subjection to the empire.46 And, from that of the Rurikids, even if it be difficult to assert unequivocally their acceptance of the emperor's political control, there did obtain a certain "meta-political," "pneumatic," ascendancy which they, together with the other members of Byzantine Christendom, conceded to the imperial pontifex maximus of the "New Rome."47 However, when the Imperial Church definitively broke with the Catholic communion, the Russian Church did not immediately follow its example. The close family ties binding the Rurikids to the West, the existence of an anti-Byzantine faction among the Russian clergy, and, finally, the fruition of Russia's own "microcosmism" constituted obstacles to the immediate success of the Cerularian secession in the Rurikid dominions.

From the facts at our disposal regarding the pre-Mongol history of the Russian Church it appears certain that during that period that religious body did not follow, officially at least, the Cerularian break with Rome. Among these facts, we find, e.g., that down to the end of the thirteenth century no question of a difference in religion was ever raised in connection with the numerous marriages of Rurikids with Catholics (Leib, pp. 143-178), and that Izjaslav I of Kiev (1054-1078), a friend of the monks of the Crypt Monastery, a leading center of Russia's religious life, placed his country under the protection of the Holy See, to which he expressed his fidelity, in 1075, while his son Jaropolk mani fested his devotion to St. Peter the Apostle (Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, n. 238; text ad ann. 1086 [p. 169] and n. 245 [p. 271]). Vernadsky, therefore, rather begs the question when stating (Kievan Russia, p. 344) that the wives of the two princes "must have become, officially, members of the Greek Orthodox Church" though "it seems that neither broke with Roman Catholicism in her heart" (cf. also the explanations in connection with Anna Jaroslavna, Queen of France, pp. 342-343, and the reference to the legendary episode of Roman of Galicia-Volynia, pp. 345, 230 and n. 12 : possibly this son of a Polish princess was falling under the influence of his Byzantine wife; cf. his genealogy in Baumgarten, G?n?alogies, pp. 23, 26, 47). It is to be remembered that even in Byzantium the immensity of the Cerularian secession was not realized at the time and that, whatever the attitude of the hierarchs, the simple faithful con tinued, for a half-century or so, to entertain friendly relations with the Catholics ; cf. E. Card. Tisserant, "The Holy See and the Byzantine Church and Empire," The Review of Politics, IX (1947), p. 279. 49 A.

Thus, the Byzantine spiritual contacts were not interrupted, and, in fact, the Russian Church rose in importance as a doubly privileged body and the sole unifying factor in the country. The Mongol temporal "Iron Curtain" completed the Byzantine spiritual one; and the seeds of Byzantine religious isolation sown in the eleventh century came to full fruition in the thirteenth.52 Meantime, the hegemony among the Rurikid princes, which the southern State of Kiev had lost even before the Mongol onslaught, was taken up, in the northeastern regions, by the Princes of Moscow.53 This junior branch of the Rurikid house, supported to the hilt by the Russian Church, slowly began converting that hegemony of East Russia into a unitary sovereignty. The Muscovite princes successfully curried favor with their Mongol masters, who connived at their climb ing,54 and?also successfully?strove to Mongolize their own expand ing State. The influence of the essentially monistic Mongol imperial ideology, changing Russia's socio-political aspect, served to enhance, and was in turn enhanced by, the monistic Byzantine tradition which had molded Russia's politico-religious Weltanschauung.55 Thus, 5&lt;) The most recent treatment of the Mongol domination of Russia and of the rise of the Muscovite State is in Vernadsky, The Mongols and Russia. 61 So Spengler, Decline of the West, II, chap. VII, ii (p. 192), chap. X, ii (p. 335, n.l). 52 Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 152-153: "Russia's political dependence on the Mongols made her church safe from the pope's pressure [sic]." 53 But not without opposition from some other princes, such as those of Tver', who strove to play the same role as Moscow ; Vernadsky, op. cit., chap. IV. 54 Some attempts, however, were made by the Golden Horde to impede the rise of Moscow. Though the latter princedom had come to monopolize the grand ducal dignity, which implied overlordship vis-?-vis the other princes, the Khan exempted from it, raising to the same status of grand dukes, the Princes of Rjazan', Suzdal', and Tver'; Vernadsky, op. cit., pp. 199, 201, 206, 255, 350. 55 Mongol societal monism, inspired (not unlike Eusebius of Caesarea's) by a kind of monotheism, was utterly devoid of all "microcosmism" and conjoined with an objective concept of universality; cf.

Voegelin, "The Mongol Orders of Submission to European Powers, 1245-1255," Byzantion, XV (1941), 378</page><page sequence="24">434 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME Muscovy was clasped within the embrace of two foster-parents, the empires of the "New Rome" and of the Golden Horde. Within two centuries the balance shifted. The two imperial over lords were growing senile and Muscovy was coming of age. Soon, she set herself free from their tutelage. Muscovite rejection of the temporal suzerainty of the Horde was preceded and complemented by a spiritual emancipation. Precisely as the psychological separation of Byzantium from Rome had preceded the formal break, so now Moscow's emancipation from Constantinople was first psychologically achieved and then formally argued. The psychological separation sprang from the progressive fragmentation implied, as has been seen, in the conjunction of Byzantine "microcosmism," caesaropapism, and phyletism. The latter element, in particular, was suggestive of trans lating the Byzantine corpus politicum mysticum into the custody of a more vigorous race. The notion of a translatio imperii to one of Byzantium's "pneumatic" dependencies had thus been in the air for some time; it spawned the Bulgarian and Serbian "empires," with Caesar and Patriarch each, that troubled the sunset of Constanti nople.56 Since, however, the Imperial City was to them the matrix of the empire, these microcosmic empires strove further to strengthen their pretensions by attempting to conquer it. Only when these efforts failed did another solution present itself. The fourteenth-century Bulgarian translator of the chronicle of Constantine Manasses voiced it, when in rendering the Greek passage suggestive of the supersedure of Rome by Constantinople, he replaced the latter by "our new Imperial City (= Cargrad)" i.e., Trnovo, the Bulgarian capital.57 Translatio imperii involved translatio urbis. Thus, Byzantine lessons worked in the end against the teachers. The fragmentation and sep aration contained within some of them have just been mentioned. Likewise, the idea of the renovatio implied in "Second-Romism" involved the possibility of a still "newer" city. 413; Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 92-99, 102-103, 121-130; and chap. V.

In 1439 the reunion of various Eastern Christian bodies with the Catholic Church was promulgated at the Council of Florence. But though accepted by both the Emperor and Patriarch of Constantinople and by Russia's primate, Cardinal Isidore, the Union of Florence was rejected by the Mongolizing60 Grand Duke Basil II of Muscovy.61 Byzantine instruction had not been lost upon Russia and proved once again detrimental to the teacher. Russia's faith in the "orthodoxy" of the "New Rome" was shaken. Following Florence, the Muscovites tended to regard Byzantium with the same mixture of emulation and disdain as the Byzantines had evinced toward Rome; the Kievan polarity of attitude had reappeared in Muscovy. The second event was the fall of Constantinople in 1453? a fitting punishment, in the Muscovite eyes, for the "defection" at Florence.62 58 The latest discussion of this process is found in Medlin, Moscow and East Rome, pp. 62-124; cf. Str?mooukhoff, Moscow the Third Rome. 59 Supra, n. 34 ; cf. Medlin, op. cit., pp. 69-71 ; Olsr, Gli ultimi Rurikidi, pp. 326. co For Basil's Mongolizing and its connection with his sobriquet Temnyj, see Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 320-322, 327-328, 383. 61 Ammann, Abriss d.ostlawKirchengesch., pp. 137-147; Th.

Pierling, La Russie et le Saint-Si?ge, Etudes diplomatiques, I (Paris, 1906), 1-59, 60-105.?By ousting the Cardinal-Metropolitan Isidore in 1441 and by having the Russian bishops elect Jonas of Rjazan' in his place in 1448, Basil II placed the Church of his realm in a state of virtual, though not official, schism from Constantinople, which had officially accepted the Union and on which the appointment of the heads of the Russian Church depended. 62 Typical of this attitude are the anti-Florentine and, consequently, also anti-Byzantine pamphlets ascribed to that doubtful cleric, Simeon the Suzdalian, who hails Basil as a "defender of the faith" (in Malinin, Siarec Eleazarova monastyrja, pp. 99-100), and also?very properly?the opinion of Jonas, who replaced Isidore, as to the well-merited fate of the Imperial City (Pamjatniki drevne-russkago kanoniceskago prava, in Russkaja Istoriceskaja Biblioteka, VI</page><page sequence="26">436 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME The ideological argument was a thing of great simplicity. The Byzantine tradition received by Russia contained two cardinal doc trines: first, that the Roman Empire was a theophanic and divinely instituted polity which was coincident, coequal, and coeval with the Church and, therefore, like her imperishable ; second, that orthodoxy was Caesar's?political or phyletic Caesar's?thing and, thus, insep arable from the empire. In this way, the Byzantine "betrayal" at Florence, on the one hand, and the downfall of Constantinople and of the South Slavic would-be empires, on the other, left Muscovy the sole Greek Orthodox polity practically, and soon completely, independent of Muslim rule and, consequently, alone capable and worthy of receiving the translatio imperii. Russia was of necessity the stage for the third act of the divine drama as manifested in Roman imperial history. "Second-Romism" had given birth to "Third Romism" : Moscow was the Third Rome.63 Already in 1451, between Florence and the fall of the imperial city, a Muscovite divine foreshadowed the idea of the "Third Rome."64 In 1470, resuming the earlier trend of recalcitrance and continuing Basil II, the Grand Duke John III declared the Patriarch of Constan tinople to be "deprived of any right over our Church."65 In 1492, [St. Petersburg, 1908], 623). Cf. Medlin, Moscow and East Rome, pp. 66-76. The polarity of Russian attitude towards Byzantium is well illustrated in the case of John IV, who, on the one hand, sought the Constantinopolitan patriarch's recognition of his title (infra, n. 92) and, on the other, declared to Possevino that his religion was not that of the Greeks; cf. Pierling, Papes et Tsars (1547-1597), d' apr?s des documents nouveaux (Paris, 1890), p. 312. 63 For this argument see the bibliography, supra, n. 1 ; to this may be added : P.

Philotheus declared68 that: in his stead (1441-1448; supra n. 61) ; the negation of the Constantinopolitan patriarch's jurisdiction in Muscovy (1470), even though the pretext for the previous step?the reunion of Constantinople with Rome had been removed by the Ottoman conquest, constitute the milestones on the road of the Muscovite Church's progress towards "autocephaly" ; cf.

It is possible, of course, that Constantinople is still meant here instead of Moscow (cf. Str?mooukhof?, Moscoiu the Third Rome, p. 86, n. 13), but this seems somewhat less probable in view of the historical context. The 1512 redaction of the Chronography has been supposed to have Philotheus of Pskov for the author (cf. Str?mooukhof?, p. 96-97). 68Malinin, Starec Eleazarova monastyrja, pp. 50-55; also "Poslanie starca Pskovskago Eleazarova monastyrja Filofeja k velikomu knjazju Vasiliju Ivanovicu," Pravoslavnyj Sobesednik, I (Kazan, 1863), 343-344.? Philotheus' other epistles contain fragments of the same theory; the work purporting to be his epistle to John IV (Malinin, pp. 57-66) further elaborates it by comparing the Church to the Woman clothed in the sun of the Apocalypse, and the wilderness into which she fled (Apoc. 12:6) to Russia, which there upon became her sole abode. The same idea is expressed allegorically in the Novgordian legend of the White Klobuk (ecclesiastical headgear), whose authorship and exact date are still a matter of dispute, but which seems to have some connection with the pro-Muscovite Archbishop of Novgorod, Gen nadius (1485-1504). It is concerned with the transmission of a piece of Byzan tine ecclesiastical insignia from Rome to Constantinople, and thence to the "Third Rome" : "for in the Third Rome, which is in the Russian land, the grace of the Holy Ghost shone forth" (Pamjatniki starinnoj russkoj literatury, ed. G. Kuselev-Bezborodko, I [St. Petersburg, 1860], 296; cf.

The literary sources of Philotheus are re-examined by Str?mooukhof?, esp. pp. 96-101 ; the contemporaneous influence of the caesaropapist Deacon Agapetus's Exposition of the duties of princes (A.D. 527) is dealt with in S?vcenko, Neglected Byz.Source of MuscovJPol.Ideology. 69 The puerile argument of the followers of Cerularius against the Latin use of unleavened bread in the liturgy was that, whereas the leavened bread of the Byzantine rite was (symbolically speaking) "animated," that of the Latins was "dead" (cf. Nicetas Stethatus, in Michel, Humbert und Kerullarios, II, 321 322). From this accusation stemmed another: that the use of unleavened bread implied the Catholic Church's profession of the heresy of Apollinaris of Laodicea; Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, p. 207, n. 4, 373-376. For the Byzantine attacks on the Catholic Church in general see A. Palmieri, "De Orientalium in schismate defendendo peccatis," Acta Academiae Velehradensis, I-III (1912) ; for Apollinarism and its negation of the human soul of Our Lord see the most recent study by A. Grillmeier, S.J., "Die theologische und sprachliche Vorbereit ung der christologischen Formel von Chalkedon," in Grillmeier-Bacht, Das Konzil von Chalkedon, I (W?rzburg, 1951), 5-202, esp. 102-120. 70 The Russian word is sobornaja, translating, from about the fourteenth century, KaOoXucrj, in lieu of the old kafoliceskaja (cf., e.g., A. Gezen, Istorija slavjanskago perevoda Simvola Very [St. Petersburg, 1884]). The adjective sobomyj (from sobiraf, "to gather together") is an ambiguous one, for besides translating "catholic" (an obsolete use now, save in the Creed) it denotes also that which pertains to a council (sobor). Since the days of Xomjakov, and under Western influences, much has been said in Russia, especially by the Slavophiles, on the sobornosf of the Church; in our own day, S. Bulgakov and N. Berdjaev have expounded this ultra-spiritualist and yet chauvinist tran scription in ecclesiological terms of the doctrine of popular sovereignty. How ever interesting this idea may be, it is grounded in a rather humorless play on words resulting from the comparative poverty of early-Slavic terminology. It is curious that the above adjective should have been transcribed as "synodal" in Medlin, Moscow and East Rome, p. 93 etc.</page><page sequence="29">CYRIL T0UMAN0FF 439 For reasons to be examined later, the official attitude of the last Muscovite Rurikids (1462-1598) fell short of such contemporaneous proclamations of the translatio as came from the ecclesiastical quarters. It was also less "historiosophic." The official ideology that can be elicited from state documents and state ceremonies merely asserted an imperial status as inherent in the Rurikid sovereignty of "All Russia" and as only remotely derived from the "Second Rome" through the fictitious transfer of imperial regalia to Vladimir II Monomakh.71 Yet in context with another series of events this official ideology of the statesmen can be shown to contain hidden within itself claims to no less, but actually to even more than did its unofficial counterpart of the ecclesiastics : not the "Byzantine inheritance" only, but that of the two former imperial overlords of Muscovy, the Golden Horde as well as the "New Rome." The first event was, of course, the marriage in 1472 of John III, Grand Duke of Muscovy, to Zoe-Sophia Palaeologina, a niece of the last Eastern Emperor,72 who with a fine disregard for the Roman constitutional theory73 and for her genealogical position74 71 The "lay" Muscovite political doctrine has been analyzed in Olsr, Gli ultimi Rurikidi.

Kluchevsky, A History of Russia, trans. C. J. Hogarth, II (London/New York, 1912), 20.?Fr. Olsr has shown that, until John IV at least, the title of Czar (car') was used unofficially and vaguely, chiefly for the benefit of foreigners ("Grand Prince" or "Grand Duke" being capable of imply ing a vassalage vis-?-vis the Western Emperor), and (he argues) without the definite implications of the Byzantine unique cosmocrator; op. cit., pp. 327-329, 334, 340-342. The really significant title was that of Velikij Gosuda/ ("Great Sovereign"), which signified that Muscovy was a great Power; ibid., pp. 330-334. Yet, though vague and unofficial, "Czar" did translate ?amkevs (infra, n. 77), and in the official acts, such as the coronation ceremony of 1498 (infra, n. 79), the references to the Muscovite sovereign's position as Czar [= basileus] of Greek Orthodox Christendom [= oikoumene] can only be construed, as Medlin indicates (pp. 79, 104), as implying the Byzantine suc cession?let alone the fact that, beginning with that of 1498, all the Muscovite coronation ceremonies were borrowed from Byzantium. That John III sought the Western Emperor's recognition of equality need not militate against that implication. After all, subjective universality had made the Byzantine cosmoc racy a mere "microcosmocracy" ; and the Basilid Emperors, while claiming to be the "pneumatic" fathers of the other monarchs of their oikoumene, did recog nize some of the greater among those of the "outside" as their "pneumatic" brothers; cf. supra, n. 41. 77 East-Slavic and South-Slavic car' is the equivalent of ?amkevs ; its generally accepted derivation from "Caesar" through the Bulg. cesar has been somewhat put in question by Vernadsky who would suggest for it an Iranian origin; Ancient Russia, pp. 253-254. As ?. had become for the Byzantines primarily the imperial title, so car' was for the Russians Kar i?oxr?v the title of the Byzantine and Mongol emperors; cf. Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 385, 153. Nevertheless, car' continued to be used for kings of biblical and classical asso ciations (such, e.g., as those of Egypt or Georgia), for they were felt to be a part of the Byzantine microcosmic oikoumene ; Western kings, who were "out side," were given the title of koroV (derived from Charlemagne and a functional equivalent of the Byz. pn?), while the Western Emperor was styled cesar'.

John IV had him self officially crowned czar in 154782 and then proclaimed his succession to the Golden Horde through the conquest of two of its successor states, Kazan (in 1552) and Astrakhan (in 1556) ,83 Under Theodore, the Primate of Russia was elevated in 1589 to the rank of a patriarch, replacing the "fallen" Patriarch of Rome.84 All the imperial inher with ecclesiastical writers, that the monk Thomas addressed Boris, Grand Duke of Tver' (f 1461), rival of Moscow, as car'; on the other hand, Tver' may have been regarded by her children as the natural destination of the translatio imperii, instead of Trnovo or Moscow; cf.

The reasons for the official reticence about the "Byzantine inher itance" on the part of the Muscovite government are not far to seek. They were both political and psychological. Politically, that inheritance had become a slogan with which the West, with its perennial lack of insight into the Russian realities, endeavored to draw Muscovy into an anti-Ottoman?anti-Muslim?crusade. But Muscovy had her own Muslim policy?one of a diametrically opposite orientation, and had no intention of quarrelling with Islam.85 First of all, prior to 1480, she was still?albeit in pure theory?a Muslim sovereign's vassal and had become his hopeful heir.86 She, moreover, greatly benefited by her alliance with another Muslim State, the Crimea, enemy alike of Lithuania, Muscovy's rival in the gathering of "All Russia," and of the Golden Horde. Then, in 1478, the Khan of the Crimea became a vassal of the Ottoman Sultan. With the newly risen Ottoman Empire, Muscovy had no desire to be at odds ; in fact, she sought, and in 1492 obtained, through the mediation of the Crimean ally, an inauguration of friendly relations with the Porte.87 In this connection, Muscovite Russia was not averse to posing as something of a "Muslim Power."88 This political system of collaboration with Islam might have been upset by any overt reference to the "Byzantine inheritance" with all its implications. When, finally, after the conquest of Kazan and Astrakhan, the Crimean alliance was ended, the Khanate long remained a serious menace to Muscovy from the south, which would only have been enhanced by additional Ottoman hostility.89 85 Cf. Pierling, Russie et l'Orient, pp. 133-158; Papes et Tsars, pp. 1-26; La Russie et le Saint-Si?ge, pp. 311-315. 86 Already prior to the formal overthrow of the Horde's suzerainty, Basil II of Muscovy set up in 1452/3 a Tatar khanate (carstvo=zkmg?om, "empire") of Gorodec or Kasimov under a Genghisid prince (Qasim ibn Muhammad) and vassal to himself; Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 331-332. 87 A good outline of these relations will be found in O. Halecki, Borderlands of Western Civilization (New York, 1952), pp. 142-146; cf. Pierling, Russie et l'Orient, pp. 135-140; Vernadsky, op. cit., pp. 314-332. 88 In 1570, John IV's envoy to Constantinople, Novosil'cov, assured the Sultan that the Czar was not an enemy of Islam ; and John the Terrible wrote to Selim II the Sot that the Muslims enjoyed a perfect liberty in Muscovy; cf.

The fiction of an inherent imperial quality of the Rurikid dynasty, as "by ancient law estab lished," was, evidently, more satisfying; but since some legal basis still had to be given for it, the translatio was, indeed, admitted, but at the same time pushed into a remote past.92 Quite obviously, official statements cannot be taken as the sole data for the ideological development of a nation, especially when there "The authority of the Rurikid princes was greatly limited by Mongol suzerainty; it was, moreover, entirely dependent on the Khan's appointment (jarlyq) and revocable at will. The suzerain of the Rurikids, the Khan of the Golden Horde (more properly: "White Horde"; cf. Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 138-140), or in Russian: car1 Ordynskij, was himself a vassal of the Great Khan. The princes were obliged to present themselves before their overlord and to proffer signs of submission which included the kotow; Vernadsky, pp. 144 145, 214-232, 344, 354-355, 357-358. 91 Already Fr. Antonio Possevino, S.J., so analyzed Muscovite hauteur ; cf. Vernadsky, op. cit., p. 385. 92 Muscovy's newly achieved position of a great Power was thus projected into the past, to the very foundations of Rurikid Russia. We have already seen the claim that the translatio occurred under Vladimir II (supra, at n. 71) : this was referred to in the coronation ceremonies of 1547, 1584, and 1613 ; Sobranie gos.gramot i dogov., II, Nos. 33, 51; I (1813), No. 203; Dopolnenija k aktam istoriceskim, I (St. Petersburg, 1846), No. 39; Polnoe Sobranie Russk.L?top., XIII, 1 (1904), 450-451; cf. Medlin, Moscow and East Rome, pp. 101-102, 114, 134. On this basis the crown of Muscovy (apparently a gift of a Khan of the Golden Horde) came to be known as sapka Monomaxova; Vernadsky, op. cit., p. 386. Another legend pushed the translatio farther back to St. Vladimir I, the first Christian prince (f 1015) and husband of the Porphyrogenita Anna; thus, the charter of the Constantinopolitan patriarch Joasaph II, of 1561, recognizing John IV's title of Czar, made mention of his descent from the Blood Imperial (Russkaja Istoriceskaja Biblioteka, XXII, 2 [St. Petersburg, 1908], 67-75), and the Apostolic Vladimir was referred to in coronation cere monies; Dopolnenia k akt.ist., I, No. 145 (1598) ; Sobranie gos.gramot i dogov., I, No. 203; cf. Medlin, pp. 118-119, 134. Fr. Olsr (Gli ultimi Rurikidi, pp. 342-348) minimizes perhaps too much (in the face of Mme. Schaeder and Malinin) the element of the "Byzantine inheritance" in these two legends. This projection back of the translatio indeed conferred upon the Rurikids an imperial status as "from of old" ; yet in both cases the Byzantine basis of that status is inescapable. It may be noted in passing that the genealogical argument of both</page><page sequence="34">444 MOSCOW THE THIRD ROME are reasons to suspect these statements of having been deliberately watered down. So, undeterred by official reserve, the ideology of "Third-Romism" continued to mold the Weltanschauung of the Muscovites. And, later on, under the upstarts, the Godunovs and the Romanovs, who followed the Rurikids on the throne, but who could not lay claims to any such dynastic self-sufficiency as the latter had evinced, and in whose day the Tatar yoke was long past and the Crimean and Ottoman menace less formidable, the basic ideology of the "Third Rome" threw off its official veils.93 There was, in this ideology, a slight inconsistency, given the prem ises?one of having the translatio imperii to Moscow and still admitting the ecclesiastical primacy of Constantinople, even after the creation of the Muscovite patriarchate. It implied the co-existence of two sub jective and microcosmic oikoumenai: the purely Muscovite of the "oecumenical" czar and the pan-Greek-Orthodox of the "Oecumenical Patriarch."94 But in the excitement of the discovery of the new idea, its inner contradiction was not perceived by the Russians of the sixteenth century. To them, "Holy Russia" was indeed the oikoumene, with its own Caesar and Patriarch and matrix of empire?Moscow the "Third Rome." This subjectively-oecumenical, national-Orthodox corpus politicum mysticum was in the eyes of its denizens the only legends is unfounded. The Rurikids did not descend from St. Vladimir's Byzantine marriage (cf. Baumgarten, G?n?alogies, p. 7 )and the connection of Vladimir II's mother with Constantine IX Monomachus (whose surname he assumed) is undeterminable (Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, Primary Chronicle, n. 192 [p. 263]). It is interesting to see to what an extent the formulators of these high claims?beginning with John III who refused the royal crown offered by the Western Emperor and asserted that his predecessors had lived on terms of brotherhood and amity with the Eastern Emperors (Pamjatniki diplomaticeskix snosenij drevnej Rusi s derzavami inostrannymi, I [St. Peters burg, 1851], 17)?appeared oblivious of the Rurikids' recent abject position vis-?-vis not only the Mongols (cf. supra, n. 90), but also the Byzantines, in whose eyes their head, the Grand Duke, had not rated as more than a mere Master of the Table at the imperial Court ; cf. Vasiliev, Was Old Russia a Vassal State of Byzantium?, pp. 353-354; Olsr, pp. 331-333. 93 For this increase of Byzantinism see Medlin, op. cit., pp. 113-121, 133-134, 145, 148. It was only under the first Romanovs that Muscovy entered into a military conflict with the Ottomans and that it began seriously to speak of a crusade and?an integral part of the "Byzantine inheritance"?the drive towards Constantinople; cf. C. de Grunwald, Trois si?cles de diplomatie russe (Paris, 1945), pp. 17-22. ?4 Cf. Medlin, op. cit., pp. 117-118.</page><page sequence="35">CYRIL T0UMAN0FF 445 microcosm of the universe. The inherent caesaropapism of this world was intensified by the writings and activities of the "Josephian" party of churchmen.95 Several other fictions were used to enhance and embellish this "Russian Idea." Among them was the legend of the apostolate in Russia of St. Andrew the "First-Called";96 and the equally telling claim of the Rurikid house to be descended from an imaginary brother of Caesar Augustus.97 More revealing still, though not to the Mus covites themselves, were the two "historiosophic" Tales of the King dom of Babylon demonstrating Moscow's position at the summit of the drama of history by tracing, in the spirit of Daniel's visions, the imperial power of her predecessor Byzantium, beyond Rome, back to Babylon.98 To the early Church?the new Israel?pagan and monistic 9r?

Medlin, pp. 114-115 ; and supra, n. 28. For Muscovite caesaropapism, see Medlin, esp. pp. 104-124, 147-148, etc. 96 The false apostolicity of the see of Constantinople reposed on the legend of its founding by St. Andrew, which appeared in the sixth century (cf., e.g., Jugie, Le schisme byzantin, p. 22). He was also claimed by mediaeval Georgia as her first illuminator (cf. my Christian Caucasia, ? 11) ; finally, in the eleventh century, he was believed to have journeyed in what was to be Russia (this legend was incorporated into the Primary Chronicle, cf. trans, and ed. Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, pp. 53-54 and n. 39 [pp. 223-224]), and, in the sixteenth (Chronography of 1512, pp. 346 f.), he was said to have preached there; cf. Ammann, Abriss d.ostslaw.Kirchengesch., pp. 10-11. 97 The Account of the Princes of Vladimir (Skazanie o knjaz'jax Vladi mirskix), composed under South Slavic influences c. 1480/1523, contains for the first time (1) the above claim, and (2) the story of the transmission of the imperial regalia from Constantine IX Monomachus (1042-1055) to Vladimir II (1113-1125 ; the anachronism did not at first embarrass the Muscovite politico religious theorists, but later Constantine was replaced by Alexius I ; for the transmission, cf. supra, nn. 71, 92). The first claim was much used by John IV and referred to in the coronation ceremonies of the first Romanov, in 1613 (Sobranie gos.gramot i dogov., I, No. 203, 599) ; the story of the transmission inspired, c. 1523, the monk Spiridon-Sabbas to compose an Epistle on the sub ject; cf. I. Zdanov, Russkij bylevoj epos (St. Petersburg, 1895), pp. 1-151 (con tains an edition of the Skazanie) ; N.

Of this Babylonian aspect of imperial Rome, Constantinople was the indisputable heir ; thus Moscow earned the appellation, given her in our own day, of the "Fourth Babylon."99 It is of the nature of the dynamic of "Neo-Romism," both Byzantine and Muscovite, to attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable inheritances of Babylon and of Jerusalem,100 of imperialism and of messianism. Muscovy, accordingly, was now invested with the awesome and messianic duty of the sole dispenser of orthodoxy in the world. And, just as the subjective universality of the Roman Empire did not deter it from expanding over that which lay outside its boundaries, so now the co-extension of Greek Orthodoxy with the Muscovite world signi fied the latter's expansionist outburst, directed in the first place toward all the lands of the Greek Orthodox microcosm. Thus, exactly as Constantinople had endeavored to bring within her sphere her envied prototype, so now to inherit the "Second Rome" was not the least of the duties of the Third. Soon, however, the seemingly harmonious dream of the Muscovite divines and statesmen was subjected to two rude shocks, before being completely transformed in the Petersburgian period. One shock came in connection with the ecclesiastical reforms of the Patriarch Nicon. They caused, in the seventeenth century, the above-mentioned con tradiction implied in that dream to manifest itself in an internecine strife. It was the struggle of those who, taking au pied de la lettre the dream of the "Third Rome," believed in the perfection of their Muscovite oikoumene, and those who, failing to find that perfection in the dreary and squalid realities of Muscovite Russia, sought to Babylon. They appear to be of Byzantine origin, whereas the Account of the Princes of Vladimir (supra, n. 97) is their Muscovite continuation and con clusion. Cf. Zdanov, loc. cit. (contains also an edition of the Tales) ; Gudzij, ?oc. cit. For the Muscovite preoccupation with what was deemed to be scriptural evidence for imperial history (especially Daniel and the Apocalypse), see Str?mooukhof?, Moscozv the Third Rome; Schaeder, Moskau das dritte Rom. 99 A.

Armstrong, "The Fourth Babylon," The Tablet (London), 25 August 1945. 100 In addition to claiming the Babylonian-Byzantine inheritance, the Rurikids and their Muscovite successors insisted?like any other Christian kings, as a matter of fact?on their spiritual succession to the Kings of Israel. References to this "Israelite succession" are found, e.g., in the coronation ceremonies of 1498, 1547, 1584, 1598, 1613; cf.

It was, to a certain extent, the old polarity of urges, to and away from Byzantium, come to the fore. With the crown's support, the broader conception was victorious. Without it, Nicon's attempt also to revive somewhat the long-lost notion of the primacy of the spiritual proved an utter failure.101 The second blow was dealt by the iconoclastic westernization insti tuted by Peter the Great, which seemed to shatter the Muscovite dreams.102 Yet Peter's activity did not destroy the old idea ; it merely transcribed it in secularist terms. Exactly in the same way, the conversion of Constantine had merely veneered, without altering, the inherent societal monism of the Roman State. The irrational current which any impartial historian can detect in the foreign policy of the Russian Empire after Peter the Great, imperialism for its own sake, Greek projects, the drive to the Balkans and on to Constantinople? all this can be regarded as a manifestation of the permanence of the idea of Moscow the Third Rome. To be sure, the "brother-Orthodox" came to be spoken of as "brother-Slavs" with Russian imperialist messianism undergoing a transcription into the racist terms of Pan slavism, and, instead of the co-extension of Russia with Greek Orthodoxy, a co-extension of Russia with Slavdom was sought. But it was the same old idea that gave all its vigor to what has been called Russia's "permanent mission."103 With it survived, too, the inner contradiction of claiming the succession both of Babylon and of Sion, as that dialectic of aggression and of persecution complex which characterizes Russia's attitude toward the "outside." Even today, the dominant Marxist ideology of Russia has not destroyed the ancient tradition. It has merely merged its own antag onism to religion and its expansionist materialistic millennarianism with the hatred of the True Rome and messianic expansionism inherent in the "Third Rome."
