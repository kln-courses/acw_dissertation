<plain_text><page sequence="1">Th ore au* s Flute, or, &lt;(the Moose, the Fine Tree, &lt;&amp; the Indian " Kathleen Coyne Kelly Henry's favorite instrument was the flute, which his father had played before him... the best place for hearing its pastoral note was on some hillside, or the edge of the wood or stream; and Emerson took pleasure in its strains upon those excursions to the Cliffs, or Waiden. -Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, The Personality ofThoreau Writers stamp themselves upon their possessions more indelibly than other people. . .they seem to possess... a faculty for housing themselves appropriately, for making the table, the chair, the curtain, the carpet into their own image. -Virginia Woolf, "Great Men's Houses" I began thinking about how to approach Henry David Thoreau's flute as a thing in itself by reading everything that I could about it. I learned about its parts and manufacture and gathered together what Thoreau and his friends had to say about it. I looked at photographs of the flute and visited it in the Concord Museum.1 I brought to bear my experience in and with close reading, historical criticism, new historicism, and post-structuralist theory. However, the flute repeatedly disappeared into symbol, eluding my attempts to get at (its) materiality. Ralph Waldo Emerson, in a flight of metaphor, describes this predicament thusly: "An innavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with" (29). 2 I was finding it almost impossible to see the flute other than as an idea, something merely to think through. How might I apprehend Thoreau's flute as lively and agential without reproducing it as a personification - as one actant among many, as Bruno Latour says, in a complex assemblage of things? How could I avoid sounding a little dotty as I attempted to attend to its autonomous materiality - to what Jane Bennett calls "thing-power"?3 I found a solution in Vladimir Nabokov's Transparent Things: start fresh. Serendipitously for Thoreauvians, the novel opens as The Concord S aunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies , N.S. Vol. 22, 2014</page><page sequence="2">100 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies Nabokov's hero Hugh Person contemplates a pencil, both its thinginess and its history. As I read the passage, Nabokov/the narrator seems to praise the "novice," the you/person for whom matter is not yet opaque, inert, closed off from buzzy experience.4 Amateurs (in the most engaging sense as lovers of) are able to "fall through the surface" of things, "humming happily to themselves, and are soon reveling with childish abandon" in stories in and of things. "Transparent things, through which the past shines!" (I).5 In what follows, mindful of the elusive nature of matter (what Emerson calls its "evanescence and lubricity" [29]), I relate, with abandon, five narratives about Thoreau's flute. Attending to the thing qua thing can be exhilarating, liberatingly de familiarizing, and dangerous: every once in a while, when the sardine can looks back (as W.J.T. Mitchell puts it), one can feel the universe rearrange itself. I can't induce this uncanny feeling in my reader because experiencing a moment when the non-human world announces itself is unique to each individual and, as Thoreau often knew, impossible to convey in words. I can only attempt to chronicle my own "sinking" into the matter of Thoreau's flute. If we can accept the objectness of objects (that is, that objects exist not as immanences of the mind but in and of themselves), perhaps we can then inquire into their agency. * Tale one. Earlier this year, it was reported that Prince William told Jane Goodall that he'd like to see the entire royal ivory collection - 1,200 pieces - destroyed, including fans, miniatures, furniture, and, most spectacular, an ivory throne that an Indian maharajah gave to Queen Victoria. Up for often-bitter debate is whether destroying collections of ivory would discourage the indescribably horrific elephant poaching trade or actually increase poaching as ivory becomes scarcer and therefore more precious (Morrison). Figures 1- 3 offer a glimpse into the world of ivory trade and production in the U.S. and Africa at the end of the nineteenth century. Intending to send a signal to poachers, China and France recendy destroyed tons of their contraband ivory. In November 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crushed into powder six tons of illegal elephant ivory worth ten billion dollars ("A Look Back"). And in late 2013, a Presidential Advisory Committee voted to recommend a total ban on ivory sales within the U.S. This recommendation would not only apply to new ivory, but to all ivory</page><page sequence="3">Kathleen Coyne Kelly 101 in any form.6 Thoreau's flute is made of brass, of boxwood (. Buxus ) perhaps imported from Turkey, and ivory - most likely elephant ivory (Wood). Imagine a future in which museums decide to do something about their ivory holdings. Thoreau's flute might be ground to dust. How, and why, would this matter? In this opening narrative, the flute is a material witness to the ivory and slave trade. Fig. 1: Catalogue cover for Julius Pratt &amp; Co. goods, c. 1865 (Courtesy of Ivoryton Library Association, Ivoryton, CT; Deep River Historical Society); Fig. 2: Zanzibari Hunters, Tusks, and American Buyers, c. 1890-1910 (Courtesy of Ivoryton Library Association; Archives Collection); Fig. 3: Ivory Hunter's "Caravan" of Slaves, Congo, c. 1908 (Courtesy of Ivoryton Library Association; Zanzibar Book) Tale two. That flute was once carried around by a very flesh-and- blood Henry David in his pack or in his pocket; it absorbed the oil from his fingers and was moistened by his breath and saliva. After Thoreau's death - and perhaps at the very moment Louisa May Alcott's poem, "Thoreau's Flute," was published in The Atlantic in</page><page sequence="4">102 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies 1863 - the value of the flute changed quite radically, migrating from the personal to the public realm. Since I am a medievalist, one of the ways that I encounter the flute is as a relic, that something left behind, entombed in its case behind glass inside a museum with a highly sophisticated alarm system. It's a small shift to then think about the flute as a totem or a fetish, perhaps quite literally in the anthropological and Marxist senses, but certainly figuratively. Relics and fetishes, it should be noted, do not call us to contemplate objects; instead, we are asked to pay attention to subjects and their relations with and to objects. Moreover, our attempts to preserve relics and fetishes (in the locked cabinet in the study, in the museum) dramatize the temporality, or polytemporality, of matter: it is, as Nabokov recognizes, here and now , but also there and then ? Our collusion with things organizes our experience of the world both temporally and spatially: things beckon, are small wormholes connecting us to other things in other places and times. I would furthermore suggest that Alfred Winslow Hosmer's famous photographic tableau, his arrangement of drapery, flute, book, and telescope, is an example of this kind of organizing and ordering while it fetishizes Thoreau's flute (see Figure 4). Fig. 4: Alfred Winslow Hosmer. Photograph of Thoreau's flute, spyglass, and bird book (189-). Courtesy Concord Free Public Library. Moreover, Hosmer's manipulation of light and shadow seems to render quite vividly what Walter Benjamin calls the "aura" of a unique cultural artifact: "The genuineness of a thing," says Benjamin, "is the quintessence of everything about it since its creation that can</page><page sequence="5">Kathleen Coýne Kelly 103 be handed down, from its material duration to the historical witness that it bears" (7). Tale three. Alcott opens her elegiac poem this way: "We, sighing, said, "Our Pan is dead; / His pipe hangs mute beside the river" (1-2). She continues: "Then from the flute, untouched by hands, / There came a low, harmonious breath" (9-10). Annie Russell Marble, in Thoreau : His Home, Fńends, and Books , says that these latter lines "refer to a strange incident told by the family, that, after Thoreau's death, a passing breeze over his flute, as it hung upon the wall, brought forth a plaintive note, as if a message from its master" (315). My concern is not with the "fact" of that breath; rather, I am more interested in that "as if' as a fine bit of exegesis. The bereaved family misreads, projecting their very understandable human desires upon a combination of wind and woodwind, both of which were just going about their own business. In this third narrative, Thoreau's flute is deprived of its own bodiliness; it is re-embodied but de-materialized, troped as the sign of the poet, making Thoreau a Pan, an Orpheus, a Dionysus.8 Personification illustrates even for the most literal-minded that words are multivalent, point elsewhere, off the page, into the wild. However, personification in nature writing is too often the result of a human need, and when that need distorts our perceptions of the natural world, it becomes an ethical matter - a point, perhaps, that we don't make often enough. I just committed a pathetic fallacy (in its post-Ruskin sense) by saying that relics call and words point. Yet I want to resist the verb commit , regularly used in common collocation with crìme. I would prefer to recuperate anthropomorphism, so often described as naïve, and to rehabilitate personification and prosopopoeia, so often dismissed as sentimental.9 Imagine instead personification as the discursive trace of the matterliness of things, a strategy by which the more-than- human world announces itself across the divide that we have constructed between culture and nature. In such a context, the flute in Alcott's poem sounds quite different/ly. Left to its own devices, the flute tells its own story. Tale four. So far, I have been musing on an assemblage, a tangle of nodes and knots, that includes, but is not limited to, the Thoreau family, Alcott, Emerson, Sanborn, the Ricketsons, the makers of the flute, sheets of music and music itself, the copper and zinc alloyed to</page><page sequence="6">104 The Concord S aunterer: A. Journal ofThoreau Studies make brass, the mines and the miners who dug out the copper and zinc; the boxwood and those who cut it down, seasoned it, and hollowed it out; the elephant, those who hunted it, shot it, and sawed off its tusks; those who bought the tusks and carved them up and sent the bits to market not only as caps for flutes but as buttons, combs, piano keys, and billiard balls. I now want to insert another actant into the story: a moose- cow, and one that the reader may know from The Maine Woods .10 Thoreau, recall, finds himself assenting to a moose hunt. At the beginning of this messy adventure, Thoreau looks for "moose signs"(109) - though what he longs to read is profoundly different from what his hunting companions are after. He writes of finally seeing two moose standing on the riverbank, an experience that, he says, "fillļed] a vacuum which now first I discovered had not been filled for me" (110). Thoreau was unaware of a lack in himself: a moose-desire , perhaps a more manageable version of that earlier moment of "Contact! Contact!" An excursus into the meaning of "moose" as "wood-eaters" leads him to see " Moose men... clad in a sort of Vermont gray," the "true denizens of the forest" (110). Here, the moose looks back, in propńa persona. The moose leads Thoreau into a kind of network-think: Can he who has discovered only some of the values of whalebone and whale oil be said to have discovered the true use of the whale? Can he who slays the elephant for his ivory be said to have "seen the elephant"? These are petty and accidental uses; just as if a stronger race were to kill us in order to make buttons and flageolets of our bones; for everything may serve a lower as well as a higher use. (121) Full of what John Kucich calls an "aesthetic revulsion," Thoreau turns his thoughts to the nature of natural things - complete in themselves, "perfect," he says, in their "success" (121); unmediated, outside human purpose and immune to commodity fetishism, representing nothing, symbolizing nothing. The moose, the pine, the whale, and the elephant stand solitary in their thinginess, not yet reduced to moccasins or boards or lamp oil or caps for flutes. For a moment, suspended in time, Thoreau fronts the pine itself.11 But the balance, inevitably, tips into language: Thoreau goes</page><page sequence="7">Kathleen Coyne Kelly 105 on to say that only the poet can "make the truest use of the pine" (121). But to "use" the pine in a poem is yet another way that we draw natural things into the human orbit, turning the thing that has no need of us into an object in the marketplace - as much as lumber, or shoes, or musical instruments. This fourth narrative, then, is again not about the flute but about narrative - human narratives. Tale five . I emailed David Wood, Curator at the Concord Museum, with several questions about the flute, and more than once. I first asked him about the ivory in Thoreau's flute. Then, thinking about the flutes made by Meacham and Pond that I have seen on eBay for about $400, and also about Eric Clapton's guitar, Blackie, which in 2004 sold for almost $1,000,000, I asked Wood what the flute was insured for and what he thought it might be worth. He put me off; I did not expect otherwise. I also asked Wood if he knew anything about the last time someone played the flute. There is a story about Walton Ricketson playing the flue at a gathering at the Concord Town Hall in the early twentieth century.12 We have another story - undocumented, thus making it all the more compelling - about someone playing the flute in the 1960s, the perfect decade for freeing the flute from its box.13 I thought of writing one last email to Wood: could I play Thoreau's flute? This is an idea almost as shocking as contemplating its destruction. And it would make a fine tale - but not, of course, about the flute. * Those with an object-oriented or new-materialist bent are notorious for making use of long lists of disparate objects, yet they seldom fix on a single object on which to try out their theories. And perhaps the least interesting thing to do, or the finally-impossible thing to do, is to attempt to confront and apprehend any thing-in-itself. We can never address a thing directly, but we can speculate. Telling tales about Thoreau's flute has its pleasures - even uncomfortable pleasures - but there's also much at stake. The history of literary theory demonstrates that taking a particular approach to a text (historicist, new critical, feminist, etc.) precludes alternative readings; at the same time, a given approach deploys (and often invents) a vocabulary that allows us to see what was hitherto occluded, even repressed (to borrow a word from a psychoanalytic approach). We</page><page sequence="8">106 The Concord S aunterer: A. Journal ofThoreau Studies hear quite often these days that the "materialist turn" is replacing the "linguistic turn" - and while for some, such "turns" have meant and will mean nothing to their practice, for others, it's good riddance to poststructuralism. In my case, working through the often- conflicting - and combative - theories that underpin the new materialism and/or object-oriented ontology has convinced me to see a focus on representationalism at the expense of materialism as a problem. I do not reject representationalism (though some new materialists and OOO theorists do); rather, and along with Timothy Morton and Jane Bennett,14 I would argue that representations matter: they are phenomena with effects. Bennett would like to negotiate a via media between those who argue for the sovereignty of autonomous objects and those who argue that the relations between and among objects are paramount - that is, between, on one side, thinkers like Harman and Morton, invested in the unapproachable, unknowable object, and, on the other, thinkers like Latour, and Karen Barad, who argue that things (including persons) don't have agency; agency arises out of relations , between and among: agency is (and extrapolating from Judith Butler) a performance. Persons and things are "intra-active"; they constitute each other, and it is in their intra-actions that agency resides.15 Bennett argues, Since everyday, earthly experience routinely identifies some effects as coming from individual objects and some from larger systems (or, better put, from individuations within material configurations and from the complex assemblages in which they participate), why not aim for a theory that toggles between both kinds of magnitudes of "unit"? ("Systems" 227) For Bennett, as for Barad and others, to acknowledge the lively agency of the nonhuman is a pressing eco-ethical question - "to make room," as Bennett says, "for the outlooks, rhythms, and trajectories of a greater number of actants" in order to "disrupt the political parsing that yields only active (American, manly) subjects and passive objects" (229). Bennett and others engaged in questioning the traditional humanist split between nature and culture furnish opportunities for literary scholars to think beyond representationalism: that is, they</page><page sequence="9">Kathleen Coyne Kelly 107 offer various positions from which to attend to things on their own terms (whether withdrawn or assemblaged) rather than as part of a signifier/ signified cultural loop in which a text is a mirror for some, a mediator for others, and all that we can know for still others. So, rather than approaching representationality and materiality as mutually exclusive or opposed, I would prefer to explore how we have historically ¿/tientangled representations and things and then stand back and see what happens when they are ^-entangled. In longing for novel relations with objects, I by no means want to give up my previous affiliations; I want to explore new affinities that might not only yield new pleasures but new ethical relations with the world. It is indisputably true that scientific insights into anthropogenic effects on ecosystems worldwide are needed if we are to devise a principled, responsible, and effective response to such changes. And the humanities, particularly the study of literature and the arts, have much to offer in this respect but are too often shut out of the conversation in academia and the public sphere.16 William Cronon says: "Nature alone cannot explain [a] landscape. You need history too." And, I would add, imaginative literature. "Poetry," says Bennett, "can help us feel more of the liveliness hidden in such things [what Bennett wants to call bodies] and reveal more of the threads of connection binding our fate to theirs" ("Systems" 232). Yes. A coda. Imagine a quiet night at the Concord Museum, a security guard on her rounds. She unlocks a certain display case, lifts Thoreau's flute out of its silk-lined box, and, elbows perpendicular to her body, brings it to her lips. Who is playing whom? NOTES My subtitle is taken from Thoreau's summary of "Chesuncook" in a letter to James Russell Lowell (504). I thank Kristen Case, Cristin Ellis, James Finley, and Michelle Neeley for their comments on an early draft. 1. See David F. Wood's An Observant Ey e , 66-7. 2. See Stanley Cavell, "Finding as Founding" on the passage in Emerson's essay, "Experience," from which this quotation is drawn.</page><page sequence="10">108 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies 3. W.J.T. Mitchell makes a useful distinction between objects and things: "Objects are the way things appear to a subject - that is, with a name, an identity, a gestalt or stereotypical template.... Things, on the other hand. .. [signal] the moment when the object becomes the Other, when the sardine can looks back, when the mute idol speaks, when the subject experiences the object as uncanny" (156). 4. See Williams and Overbey's inspiring Transparent Things : A Cabinet. Graham Harman says: "The only way to do justice to objects is to consider that their reality is free of all relation, deeper than all reciprocity. The object is a dark crystal veiled in a private vacuum: irreducible to its own pieces, and equally irreducible to its outward relations with other things" (47). This statement, typical of Harman's style and line of argument, is intended in part to get us to experience what Harman calls the "weirdness" of objects. 5. This passage is tricky, for Nabokov valorizes both surface and depth, opacity and transparency (which seems to invite depth and a plunge into history). In doing so, Nabokov enacts the problems inherent in attempting to approach things in themselves. What is particularly difficult to untangle here is whose past (or history) is singing through transparent objects - ours, or theirs? Nabokov seems to mean both, but I'm emphasizing the latter. 6. Director's Order No. 210. Also see Rob Mitchell, "Summary." 7. See Michel Serres, Conversations on Science , Culture, and Time. 8. Alcott's poem and my discussion might lead one to Thoreau's comments on the Aeolian harp in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. This would be a particularly fruitful line of thought, given Shelley's comparison of humans to Aeolian harps in A Defence of Poety and Tim Morton's strategic use of Shelley's analogy in "An Object-Oriented Defense of Poetry." I thank James Finley for pointing me to the harp. 9. Morton says: "I can't help anthropomorphizing everything I handle.... It is impossible for me to peel myself away from the totality of my phenomenological being. Just as I fail to avoid anthropomorphizing everything, so all entities whatsoever constantly translate other objects into their own terms.... The strings of the wind harp stringpomorphize the wind" ("Defense" 207). Here, anthropomorphosis is not an ecological faux pas (or worse) or a literary device but an ontological fact. For a wide-</page><page sequence="11">Kathleen Coyne Kelly 109 ranging and essential discussion of ecocentrism and literary tropes and genres (and more), see Laurence Buell, The Environmental Imagination , especially chapter six, "Nature's Personhood." 10. The Maine Woods is receiving more attention than heretofore. Two recent essays are standouts: John J. Kucich's "Lost in the Maine Woods: Henry David Thoreau, Joseph Nicolar, and the Penobscot World," and James S. Finley, c"Who are We? Where are We?': Contact and Literary Navigation in The Maine Woods ." 11. Morton offers his own account of such fronting: "Encounters with nonhuman beings are saturated with anxiety because I can't check in advance who these guys are. I just have to allow them to exist, which means that in the end, one of the people that I have to allow to exist is me, funnily enough, because I'm also one of these nonhumans" (Interview). Anxiety is an understandable response, to be sure: one has more in common with the sardine can than one would like to know. But wonder is another response, and Thoreau experiences both anxiety, as in his "Contact!" passage in "Ktaadn," and wonder, as in his account of his experience of phosphorescent wood in "Allegash and East Branch": "It suggested to me that there was something to be seen if one had eyes. It made a believer of me more than before. I believed that the woods were not tenantless, but choke- full of honest spirits as good as myself any day, - not an empty chamber, in which chemistry was left to work alone, but an inhabited house, - and for a few moments I enjoyed fellowship with them" (181). 12. According to Elizabeth D. Babcock. 13. Parkman Howe tells this story. 14. Morton says: "A poem is not simply a representation, but rather a nonhuman agent. . .poetry tampers directly with causality" ("Defense" 215, 216), and Bennett, in response, extends this idea: "the effectivity of a text-body, including its ability to gesture toward a something more than itself, is a function of a distrìbutive network of bodies: words on the page, words in the reader's imagination. . .etc." ("Systems" 232). 15.
