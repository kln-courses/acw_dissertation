PRELIMINARY About three-quarters of the items discussed here have appeared in the last decade, and all but a handful date to 1944 or later. Professional attention to the area, spurred by declining numbers of Latin students and by classics teachers' growing sensitivity to a mass audience, has never been greater. At the same time there appears to be developing a readiness on the part of classicists to participate in cross-disciplinary ventures with nonclassicists, a phenomenon adding to the need for in-translation materials. We are beyond the stage, in most places, of debating whether to teach in- translation courses or not, and are creating a more substantial body of inquiries into the matter of how to do it. There are gaps to be filled, it is clear; but a beginning has been made, and technological innovations will render future materials more ac- cessible than ever. I have concentrated on the major sources in English, and have drawn frequently on articles which, although not primarily concerned with teaching CIT, contain worth- while ideas applicable or adaptable to it. While my principal aim is to provide a practical guide, I have in some measure compromised this aim for the sake of completeness. In only a very few cases did I omit a relevant item as completely useless. Many works listed are not, strictly speaking, periodical articles; these were included either because of their extraordinary importance (e.g. PERADOTTO's APA pam- phlet on Mythology, 149), or because of their scattered locations (notably materials here and there in the ERIC/MLA documents collection). The reader will find most descriptions of specific courses in Section VI. But an attempt to organize the bulk of the bibliography by course-title or course-type would have been less useful for two reasons: 1 )The distribution of material among course- types is uneven; there is much specifically on mythology and on Greek literature in translation (see VI.C and D), but almost nothing on Latin literature in translation as such; 2) often the best ideas in the articles do not occur in discussions of specific courses, and will have value for a much broader variety of circumstances than one course would represent. This is true, for example, of the articles under the subhead "Techniques in Literary Criticism" in Section VII. The new The Teaching of Classical Subjects in English (see III, below) has several chapters dealing each with a course- type. Special thanks are due to my wife, Cecilia, for her help in canvassing the journals, and to Mrs. Anne Vanderhoof of the University of Texas at Austin Classics Library for aiding me in tracking things down. Mr. Bobby W. LaBouve, of the Texas Education Agency, provided valuable assistance in pointing out and making available sources of material. The Texas Tech University Graduate School generously provided funds to enable publication. N.B. Abbreviations: CIT = Classics in Translation. LI1T= Literature in Translation. IT = In Translation.

Association oflDepartments oflForeign Languages Bulletin (ADFLB): carries regular contributions from classicists; CIT courses are now unavoidable in discussions of classics in college curricula. Center/lor the Coordination of Ancient and Modern Studies Newsletter: available free from CCAMS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. The CCAMS is a clearinghouse of information regarding ongoing studies of antiquity and modern civilization. The newsletter includes bibliographical notes, remarks on past and future conferences, and brief substantive items. Classical Bulletini (CB): contains articles on classical literature and civilization with classroom applicability, and occasional articles on pedagogy. Classical Journal (CJ): includes regular coverage of developments in pedagogy. The "From Other Journals" department often calls attention to useful but out-of-the- way material. Classical News and Views/Echos du monde classique (CNV): journal of the Classical Association of Canada. Articles on pedagogy as well as on ancient civilization and literature. Classical Outlook (CO): journal of the American Classical League. Heavy emphasis on pedagogy, with frequent articles from high school teachers. Classical World (CW): important for its regular bibliographies of recent scholarship in various areas of classical studies (earlier bibliographies in this series are indexed in CW 67 (1974) 221-24. Also summaries of historical fiction for juveniles and annual listings of audio-visuals in classics (cf. Section VII, under RIDINGTON and SEITTELMAN respectively). Didaskailos: published by the British Joint Association of Classical Teachers. Deeply involved with documenting, and airing ideas about, teaching the classics. Regular articles on the state of the classics in other countries; regular presentation of English national school syllabuses and examinations in classics (cf. Section VII. C). Worth special note are issues 2.3 (1968) on "studying classical civilization in the vernacular," and 4.1 (1972) with emphasis on the teaching of classics in a changing situation. The JAC'I' and London Association of Classical Teachers collaborate to produce "Lactors," "cheaply produced translations of sources for the study of Ancient History." The first nine, in pamphlet form, include The Old Oligarch, Sallust anld' P.seudo-Sallust, Inscri/)iolns of the Roman Empire A.D. 14-117.

It publicizes and makes available documents ranging from brief articles to book-length materials on the teaching of foreign languages; many items are relevant to teaching CIT. See further under Foreign Language Annals, below. Foreign Language Annals (FLA): journal of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. Its occasional articles about language and culture are often relevant, mutatis nmutandis, to teaching CIT. It carries an Annual Bibliography, including sections on classical languages, and regular lists of ERIC (see above) acquisitions available in microfiche or hard copy. Every issue of FLA outlines the procedure for ordering ERIC-published materials. Greece and Ronme (G&amp;R): has not dealt specifically in its articles with the pedagogy of CIT, but many of its articles on literature and civilization are useful in CIT teaching. III.

Its non- descriptive 100 entries include several found here, plus other pieces such as T.S. Eliot's The Classics and the Mant of Letters, and emphasizes work from the sixties. MORAIN (27) provides a brief (12 items) collection of background materials in cross- cultural understanding. B. THE VALUE OF THE CLASSICS (WITH REFERENCE TO CIT)(1-3, 7-9, 12, 15. 19-2b, 28-30, 31a, 33, 34. 40,42. 59, 75, 77. 80, 82. 97. 105, 152) The publication in 1924 of the extensive ClassicalIInvestigation (Princeton), though ainmed principally at secondary-school Latin, had an important indirect influence on the teaching of CIT. It called attention to the preoccupation of classics teachers generally with grammatical, linguistic, philological competence to the detriment of a broad understanding of Greco-Roman civilization as a whole. CARR (7, 8) sum- marizes events leading up to the Investigation and its principal recommendations, and provides (8) a retrospective look at the report. Modern classicists, observes MONTGOMERY (26) in a still valuable article, betrayed the classics by insisting on the law.that the study of grammar must accompany the study of classical authors. He mentions the importance of translations and adaptations in the development of French, Italian, English, and German national literature, and says of the present: There has been a demand for the study of antiquity in the tields ot literature, history, philosophy, and art, in nonlinguistic courses. But, since the trained classicists were unwilling or unable to take over the work in these fields, other departments cheerfully accepted the responsibility. Classicists might well have grasped the opportunity. MONTGOMERY's indictment is sad, succinct, and accurate. MORTON (28) strikes similar notes. It is methods, not content, he says, that have disaffected the professional classicist from the public: "the classics have all too often been sidetracked into an area where they were limited to matters of linguistic structure." Likewise, LIEBERMAN (21) complains that the human aims and ideals of teaching classical humanities have been lost sight of, especially in the U.S., over the past half- century. LATIMER (19) presents a valuable description of classics in twentieth century American schools, relating it to ancient, medieval, and renaissance educational backgrounds. He touches on the Classical Investigation, the Airlie House Conference (for which see also CW 58 [19651 271-77 and CW 59 [1966] 185-86), and other land-</page><page sequence="7">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 167 marks. "Most of the young student's knowledge," he recognizes, "of the materials by which he is initiated into the study of Roman literature, culture, and civilization naturally comes from readings in English." He proceeds to illustrate the importance of at least some Latin language study as a complement to work in English. The Great Books Program identified with Mortimer Adler, Robert Hutchins, and the University of Chicago, depends heavily upon study of CIT. In a fascinating analogy, McLUHAN (24) compares the quarrel over the program (based on the concept of encyclopedic education which leads to eloquence and political prudence) to the historic tension between Isocrateans and Ciceronians on one hand, and Platonists and Aristotelians (for whom the center of education was - and is - dialectic and scientific method) on the other. McLUHAN concludes that there is room for both approaches in modern education, provided the Ciceronian spirit is dominant in undergraduate study and "intimate association with the scientific spirit, whether inculcated by logic and by dialectics or by the physical sciences," reserved for gr-aduate school. Is the study of Greece and Rome for the classes or the masses? The broadening of the student audience in educational institutions since 1924 has made this an inevitable question. JOHNSON (15) distinguishes between general education, as suitable for men with conventional lives and careers, and a liberal education, required by those aspiring "to blast away the outmoded and build the new." Classics is relevant to general education, though; through Cicero, Plato, Aristotle and Lucretius, JOHNSON says, it contributes to a "philosophy of practical idealism," and "since psychology and anthropology are infant industries, our best sources of knowledge concerning man are still literature and art. We need to know the two aspects of man: the timely and the universal - man of our day and man of all the centuries." ALEXANDER (42) also distinguishes between a class education and a mass education while finding room for the study of classics (including CIT) in both, although "classical studies, as we should properly think of them, never were fitted for mass production and never can be..." KELLEY (16) characterizes the realization that classical studies are for everyone as one mark of what he calls a "revolution" in classics, and notes the respectability of translations. Quintilian's "teleological orientation" is cited as a salutary model for how we should be ready to relate classics to modern events, and to use a knowledge of the past to "assist us in leading a truly human life." ERICKSON (11), like KELLEY, proposes a broad goal for the classics directed to the modern audience: "to assist in the demystification of the relationship of society to technology and pseudo- technology." Classicists, as language students diminish in number, must become more keenly aware that theirs is an interdisciplinary undertaking, and they must be "prepared to offer without condescension a wide variety of encounters with classical civilization - largely in the vernacular." Why study the classics? Many viewpoints on this question bear on the related niatter of what is the value of CIT. CASKEY (59) sees a chief mission of education as "to implant in the mind of the student solider and more nearly universal standards than those which his own fortuitous experience can have set up for him." He at- tributes this mission by implication to the classics. MORTON's (28) idea is not far froni CASKEY's: we keep coming back to the classics, he says, because of the eternal values reflected there. The importance of historical continuity between us and the ancients is stressed by several. BOLGAR (3) comments on the classics as a "fund of human experience;" DEWITT (9) replaces the word "influence" in speaking of the classics' impact with the word "stimulus," implying that what follows is a response. And LIEBERMAN (22) fixes part of the background of our "ideas, ideals, and in- stitutions" in Greco-Roman civilization. PECKETT(105) will have junior high school humanities programs concentrating on the "parts of Greek and Roman culture which became the bases of Western Christian civilization."</page><page sequence="8">168 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 Which is more important in comparing ancients and moderns: the similarities or the differences? Opinions vary. MACLEAN (23) puts the case strongly for stressing "the similarity of today's problems to those of the past." AGARD (2) urges us to look for models and guides for the future in such phenomena as "the broad-gauged, well- balanced citizen of fifth-century Greece and Augustan Rome - jack of all trades, if you will, master of none, but ... master of something infinitely more important - himself." BOLGAR (3), DORSEY (152), FINLEY (12), and ADKINS (1) emphasize the broadening effect of studying classical civilization as one different from our own; especially, adds ADKINS, since Greek culture is widely believed to be similar to modern. MILLER (25) recommends proceeding from the similar to the different, to obtain the advantages of going from the known to the unknown. WELCH (40), reviewing Snowden's The Blacks in Antiquity, praises the book for illustrating the value of comparing past and present. In view of Snowden's conclusion that "later Greco-Roman views ... rejected color as a criterion for evaluating human beings," says WELCH, we are made aware that "not all of man's change in interpersonal relationships has been in the direction of progress." DORSEY (152) sees as necessary the drawing of the contrast between ancient culture and the American value system. (See further under VI. B, below.) LIEBERMAN (20) cautions against the classicist's special temptation to stress similarities, in view of his special need to prove the contemporary worth of looking at an ancient culture. He sketches his interpretation of some of the main ancient-modern cultural differences, and adds a bibliography, mostly of secondary sources. The most sensible, comprehensive, and carefully-plotted statement on the matter is PLEKET's (33); in teaching the classics, he says, we must show as clearly as we can that the ancients, while using the same faculties as we do, such as reason, emotion, analysis, etc., sometimes found solutions for or approaches toward problems which we still may accept as wise lessons or salutary warnings, whereas in other respects their answers are in good part alien to us. Understanding in this area will doubtless develop in the near future; the Center for the Coordination of Ancient and Modern Studies, whose origin MOTTO and CLARK (29) describe, will surely foster it. Our obligation, says MOTTO (30), is not only to "transmit a seminal body of culture, so vital to the intellectual growth and development of the Western World"; further, "Our courses must .. . energize substance, 'impart wisdom,' and seek 'the good life.' " Classicists, in formulating their own purposes, need not feel themselves entirely antagonistic to the social sciences, as PLEKET (33) demonstrates: "the supposed novelty of our own world," he observes, can hardly be brought out better than by comparing it to a society with a different structure ... Though technology dominates our world and is an integral part of our culture it may be useful to be confronted with thinkers who rejected technology in any form as not being conducive to mankind's spiritual well-being. PLEKET adds that this does not mean we need to appeal to the ancients as in any way omniscient. Speaking of the problem of transmitting the classics in an individuality-conscious age of diminishing respect for authority, ELSE (75) asserts: "The classics have four things to offer to modern man which are appropriate to his need, pertinence and passion, form and freedom: pertinence to genuine problems, passion to break through the deadly pressure of abstraction on our lives, form to neutralize the fear of chaos, freedom to nurture the spirit on its own terms."</page><page sequence="9">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 169 The classics should, in the hands of teachers, have the power to move the whole man, to lead to action as well as intellectual or esthetic delight, perhaps even to provide grist for revolution. DORSEY (152), DEWITT (9), ELSE (77) and ERICKSON (80) pursue these ideas. ELSE, contrasting present-day humanistic education with "the old humanities" (i.e. the humanities of the time when that label equaled the Greek and Roman classics), reflects: "the focus of the old humanities was upon action - moral and political action - while that in the modern humanities tends to be upon certain quasi-passive modes of feeling and understanding." (Does not GOOLD, speaking as the avowed representative of the current classics-teaching tradition, confirm ELSE's estimate of the "modern humanities?" Says GOOLD (82): "The real reason we study classics is its value: and that value is quite simply the pleasure it gives us.") Contemporary humanists, continues ELSE (77), profess the old aims while working toward the new ones; theory and practice have drifted apart and must somehow be brought closer together. ERICKSON (80) suggests that current social and political awarenesses can open the way for classics professors to become "revolutionary" provided they turn to the real concerns of the people, "chuck . . . German scientism," and look for new and different questions to ask of the classical corpus. DORSEY (152) is the most blunt of the writers on this topic: in-translation courses, in his view, must reveal conceptual, esthetic, and especially ethical alternatives to the American value system or, as it is usually called, the American way of life. At a time when that value system is displaying ... its antihumanistic and inhuman effects, we must offer to students ... some of the means for developing autonomous norms instead of anomie. For this purpose the studied culture must be contrasted with our own - starkly, subtly, suavely, or shockingly. NORTON (31a) exhorts classics teachers to work with "broadened objectives." Finally, DEWITT (9) recalls that the connection between classics and revolution is not brand new. Citing Hobbes' dismay that readers of Greek and Latin authors "have gotten a habit, under a false show of liberty, of favoring tumults, and of licentious controlling the actions of their sovereigns," and adding Douglas Bush's observation that "for Milton, the classics were a trumpet and a sword," he concludes: In our own intellectually decorous field, I suppose that most of us will feel that Milton was an over-achiever. With his trumpet and his sword, he would be a problem in any seminar. John was assuredly over- stimulated by reading of these Greek and Latin authors. But I sometimes think that it would be fun if Milton were living at this hour, if reading of these Greek and Latin authors could result in an occasional tumult in higher education. Things are dull all over. The latest word in higher education appears to be that progress henceforth will consist in doing what we are doing now, only better. I am not convinced that things need be dull, by reading of these Greek and Latin authors. DEWITT also shares ELSE's worry about aims and results in humanistic education. Is "classical civilization," he asks, an impressive label that only masks a confusion of ethics with esthetics and represents "a sort of sentimental sociology or esthetic an- thropology?" As for what the classics in translation specifically will do, beyond what is implied in the already-cited statements on the value of the classics generally, FINLEY (12) notes that even seventeenth-and eighteenth- century Englishmen relied on something other than the original languages for much of what they knew of Greece and Rome, while</page><page sequence="10">170 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 PRENTICE (34) and McCRUM (97) emphasize the advantages of covering far greater quanitities of ancient literature in translation than in the original. C. OBJECTIONS TO TEACHING CIT(10, 13, 17, 35, 38, 39, 41, 57, 58) Takinig these chronologically: HALL (13) denies that translations are adequate, and warns that classicists will fall into deserved reDroach if they cannot get people to read the original. RIESS (35), in abjuring the usefulness of IT courses. appears to feel that properly-done elementary language courses will solve (in 1936) the problem of rising percentages of Latinless students. TAYLOR (38), preferring "a thorough knowledge of the lowly gerund or ablative" to a "glib faculty for repeating predigested opinions" on various topics, scorns translations accordingly. DOW (10) asks what a college student can get fronm CIT and concludes that the answer is nothing. TONSOR (39) calls reading translations a derivative experience, and therefore considers it of little value. WRIGHT (41) leaves no room for CIT in his Doctor of Liberal Arts degree proposal. KIMMICH (17) warns against LIT as a language-requirement substitute, since such a replacement "implies that in literature one language is as good as another." CARNE-ROSS cautions (57) that college IT courses, in which What a writer says must be emphasized rather than how he says it, foster "a kind of'metalinguistic' approach to literature which, paradoxically (since it began with close reading, an ear alert for verbal nuance), works hand in glove with the devaluation of the Word in modern society." The caution is expanded on by CARNE-ROSS (58). D. GENERAL OBJECTIVES: TEACHING ANCIENT CULTURE (4-6, 1 la, 14, 18, 25,27,32,33,36,37,64,80) There is a quality of mutual exclusiveness between an ancient civilization course that concentrates on presenting the best of that civilization's monuments, literary or otherwise, and one that surveys Greek or Roman life comprehensively in order to study and to generalize about characteristic underlying values and assumptions behind Greek and Roman behavior patterns. Each of these two courses may be called a course in "culture," but only if different definitions of "culture" are used. For the first we can turn to Matthew Arnold's definition, quoted by BROOKS (5); culture is "acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known or said in the world." For the second we need something like the use of the word by anthropologists, for whom culture is "the sum of attainnients and the learned behavior patterns of any specific period, race, or people" (BROOKS. 5). After contrasting these two definitions BROOKS continues: "No little confusion has resulted from the use of the same word to mean both 'best' and 'all,' for the very concept of 'best' implies that a great deal of the 'all' has been eliminated.' In order to avoid the confusion of which BROOKS speaks, and in order to have clearly-defined and sensible objectives, the teacher of an IT course must be aware of which kind of "culture" he is choosing to deal with, or just how he is combining the two. This is especially important now, when not only is there growth in the audience of students who are pursuing an acquaintance with the Greeks and Romans, but concurrently, the Greeks and Romans themselves in mass are conling into focus as subiects of inquiry. CONNOR (64) recognizes this in his remarks otn the cur-rency of the topic of "public man." Aspects of ordinary Greek and Roman lite that are covered in studies of our own era by sciences such as sociology, psychology, anid economics are receiving increased attention. A comment by ERICKSON illustrates this trend; classicists, in his view, must turn in their teaching towards "the re-al concer-ns of the [Greek and Roman] people in their struggle to find a gratitying nmode of life and solutions to their problems," while turning away from "the endless parade of generals, kings, queens, consuls, and tigureheads." The future eflectiveniess of in-translation courses depends heavily on how well teachers of such</page><page sequence="11">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 171 courses appreciate the contrast between the two meanings of "culture," and on the choices and compromises they make between Arnoldian "culture" and the an- thropologists' "culture." The loss of either of these two approaches in the range of in- translation courses available, at all levels of education, will represent a great mistortune. It is to be hoped that BROOKS' analyses of the teaching of culture, formulated primarily for use in language-teaching, will be absorbed and used by in-translation teachers as well. BROOKS (5) expands on the two versions of culture discussed above, labeling the first "formal culture" and the second "deep culture," and detailing areas which comprise each. Formal culture, for instance, includes not only great literary achievements, but also organized politics, national shrines, holidays, the contents of museums, and diplomatic civil service. Under deep culture come such matters as family ties, friendships, childhood and adulthood, expressions of masculinity or femininity, ambition, self-respect, dictates of conscience. BROOKS' remark that "culture in terms of the 'best' and culture in terms of the 'all,' though decidedly different, are at bottom closely interrelated," is amplified and qualified in a later article (6): Both the creation and appreciation of literature rest upon esthetic values which have at their very core patterns of preferment and rejection that are at marked variance with the totality of experience in which culture has its roots. A literary work presents a personal perspective on the predicaments of human life, upon which is superimposed - if it really is literature - a floodlight of intent, effect, and affect that is the very essence of fine art. Some of our most incisive penetrations into the ethos of a given culture come to us through the efforts of the literary artist. Yet in the nature of things, literature can supply us with but a part - though clearly a most valuable part - of what needs to be taught under the heading of culture. BROOKS (6) goes on to select a working definition of culture which has formal and deep aspects, and which stresses the centrality of the concrete individual person as the object of cultural study. Modifying Edward Hall, he proposes a "list of ten focal points of critical importance in . . . a culture's makeup . . . symbolism, value, authority, order, ceremony, love, honor, humor, beauty, spirit." All in all, BROOKS in these two articles and a later one (4) provides a wealth of suggestions for categories, areas of investigation, and approaches that a teacher of any in-translation course will tind enlightening and stimulating. LADU (18) and NOSTRAND (32) pursue many matters BROOKS has taken up. Both studies emphasize the fact that understanding a particular instance of behavior makes limited sense except when this instance is comparable with recognized patterns of the culture surrounding it. LADU surveys French and Hispanic cultures, using thematic categories ("le r6alisme," "T'amitie," "la liberte," "dignidad," "regionalismo,' etc.) to organize her descriptions of the French and Hispanic value systems. The French half of this same survey occurs in NOSTRAND, who stresses that "the essentials [in teaching culture] must by nature be generalizations which confer significance upon concrete facts," but also that "we must . . . live with the tentativeness of [those generalizations which] are explanations or interpretations (rather than empirical facts)." What he finds useful in teaching culture is "the sort of generalization that helps one to explain, interpret, and predict within a wide range of behavior." Values and fact assumptions - the areas in which such generalizations can be formulated - taken together make up the culture's ground of meaning: the habitual behavior patterns which very nearly determine what the bearer of the culture will perceive,</page><page sequence="12">172 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 how he will classify and structure his perceptions, and to a lesser but still significant extent, his thought processes and emotional reactions. The theories of BROOKS can contribute to the teaching of CIT. Buit for this puiripose they require careftil use, for at least three reasons: The often fragmentary niature of the evidence for Greco-Roman society; the absence of living representatives of Greco-Romilatn culture; and the prominience of "the best" as a large proportion of ouir easily accessible SOUrices for the Greeks and Romans. Can the great works of their literatuile be scaiined and organized and integrated with other sources so as to illuminiiiate areas that BROOKS classifies under "deep culture?" One thinks of Ar istoplianes. Plauitus. and Petronius (to name three) as authors who nmight be used in this way. Themilatic sourlce collections such as PLEKET proposes (33), would provide background against which students might better understand specific behavior descriibed in liter-ary works such as Plato's dialogues. Such collections might also help onle appreciate (to cite another example) the way in which Euripides' artistically- expressed viewpoints clashed with those of much of his society. We can hope for the appearance of mater-ials in this area, and we may be confident that such materials will add quality to the work of both the "Arnoldians" and the "anthropologists" among us. There are other examinations of the teaching of culture. MILLER (25) urges the teacher to proceed from similarities to differences between the target culture and that of the students; to teach both the pleasant and the unpleasant aspects of culture; and to balance the exotic with the ordinary. SEELYE (37), speaking of secondary-school instruction, advises the teacher to identify his "basic cultural purposes," pick student activities that his purposes justify, and specify circumstances of student performance and evaluation of criteria. Since SEELYE's article was written for language-class use, it will apply to CIT courses only in part. JENKS (14) combines a plea for attention to deep culture in classics teaching with a swipe at some "Humanists:" ". . . the notion that the human being can develop through study of the classics into a creature who is more human than others is pure folly." MORAIN's bibliography (27) and SEELYE's survey (36), the latter attesting to the strength of BROOKS' influence among modern language teachers, will provide the reader with a wealth of leads for further study, as will several items listed by LADU (18).

His operating premises and his proposals for action should for the most part compel assent: we must respond to the rising interest in classics as Latin loses appeal by creating new curriculum and new courses. Granted that study of the original languages is the best way of studying the ancient world, classicists have gotten themselves into deep trouble by often insisting that it is the only way. "The teacher of Classics in the future must not consider himself . . . as primarily a teacher of language, or even . . . of literature, but instead as the chief representative of the Graeco-Roman tradition in his school . . ." Good teachers at all levels can excite students with thematic coverage of the classical world: archaeology, everyday ancient life, ancient attitudes toward technology, relative vs. absolute ethical standards - the list is potentially endless. Curriculum reform ought to be in the hands of practicing teachers. BODOH (53), speaking of college, outlines three purposes of classical study: to provide "an understanding of the fundamental influence of classical civilization upon our own . . . To provide a basis of comparison and contrast" between ancient and modern civilization, and to afford the individual "an extension of his esthetic ex- perience." Other pieces range from bald pragmatism to the enunciation of the loftiest ideals. Among the most realistic are URWIN (128), MORFORD (104), DONLAN (71), ALEXANDER (42), WHITCOMB (130), and BRADLEY (56). Facing the problem of getting (English) national acceptance for classical studies as "a separate main academic course in colleges" URWIN (128) lays out realities of academic politics and human resources that transcend oceans. To wit: How can a new classics course be introduced into "a contracting or stable position" without appearing to professors in other disciplines as a threat? How to combat suspicion of classics teaching as irrelevant and outmoded? Where will overworked classicists find the energy to add new courses to existing commitments? And so on. Among his solutions is a proposal for an ancient history course "with a recognition that social and cultural history should be included as well as political," in the already-existing history department. MORFORD (104) urges that we can expand our offerings if we "exploit the vast range of interfaces which the classical subjects potentially enjoy" with various disciplines. He defines Classical Humanities as "the study of the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome in every aspect in which they affected men's lives," and takes this definition to cover classical influence up to the present. He envisions "self-contained and entirely classical" courses accompanied by a range of "those courses [that] extend beyond the limits of the Classics, and in which the classical component may be quite small." We must, he advises, seek the larger audience that this mix of courses gives us access to; and he assures us that "more students are better informed and more ar- ticulate than in earlier generations . . . " In high school, our best access route is mythology: so DONLAN (71). It is flexible enough to fit either full courses or single units; it touches the whole Greco-Roman heritage; it offers unique opportunities for comparative cultural analysis; and it is convenientlv introducible into English courses. ALEXANDER's counsel of quasi-resignation (42,43) sounds curious now; classicists, he says, should accommodate to IT courses as a compromise for survival in this uncomfortable and presumably temporary period in education, and should await patiently "a return to reason. Dabit deus his quoquefinem" (43). Finally, among the most explicitly pragmatic studies, WHITCOMB (130) proposes IT courses as one of a range of ways of reversing college language teachers' enrollment totals. Among the articles focusing on the ideals that must motivate us to welcome IT courses are two by ELSE (75, 77) and one by ERICKSON (80), mentioned previously (IV. B). GANSS (81) describes as follows the phenomenon of fading Latin in the company of rising interest in the classics: in the four centuries since Latin was pur- sued for its functional purposes in higher studies and later life, the chief objective in</page><page sequence="17">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 177 Latin courses has become "communication of knowledge about the language and culture of the Romans rather than the art of using Latin with ease." The article calls attention to how the lateness of the shift to IT courses bespeaks a lag in un- derstanding how the objectives in study of classics have (or should have) evolved. HALLORAN (85) encourages introductory and other IT courses taught by language teachers, on the grounds that the absence of a thorough student knowledge of foreign languages should not become "a barrier between our students and the availability to them of great works of literature in ... any. ., language." A similar theme appears in REXINE (115): " . . . the classics in the right form can be a positive part of a student's program but language study by itself has failed and will continue to fail to attract large numbers of students unless it is placed in its proper cultural and educational framework." To KUSTAS (93) the study of the ancient world should be conceived of as an "area study"; cf. LAMBERT (95). KELLY (89), MIEROW (100), and SPRINGER (122) encourage qualified teachers not to shrink from IT courses. MILHAM's "decalogue" (102) includes rules that recall the IT courses' place in the curriculum; note the admonitions to be aware that IT teaching involves a mix of disciplines, and to use as one's own guide the needs of student and college rather than one's own interests or the shape of the traditional curriculum. A survey of Great Books program-sponsors by SNOWDEN (120) is a reminder that in this era of longer life-spans and greater leisure, CIT have a place in adult education. SHATTUCK's essay (118), although primarily on the place of foreign language studies in interdisciplinary programs, is nevertheless of use here for its emphasis on the importance of the wholeness of the higher education experience, and on what interdisciplinary work contributes to this wholeness. His advocacy of "a stringently narrowed and deepened subject, the thorough study of a confined period of time or multiple readings of a single book in different contexts" in interdisciplinary work is also adaptable to CIT teaching. The needs of an audience that includes students with no Latin or Greek are stressed in several places, such as in ALEXANDER's atypical plea (42, 43). According to BRADLEY (56), who advocates Greek literature and Roman history, the salvation" of classical culture in the modern world "depends upon the isolation, in our minds and in our practice, of linguistic values from historico-literary-cultural values." CASKEY (59) questions our right to punish the student who will not consider Greek bv separatinig him from the Greeks. He sees great books IT as an only solution for many. ELSE (76) echoes the sentiment, and adds: "I believe . . . that to study the language and neglect the ideas they carry is a greater sin against the spirit of the Classics than to study the ideas and neglect the language." The resolutions of the Pennsylvania colloquium (78) include this: "Given the difficulties of Greek and Latin texts and the relatively short time available for their study, we recommend the judicious use of translations, both as an aid in interpreting texts and as an in- dispensable means for covering a wider range of classical literature." The colloquium discussion on teaching the classical literatures also provides a summary of the values of translations; included are their contributions to critical ability, their usefulness in enlightening the student quickly in cloudy areas, the ease with which the teacher can focus on content in using them, and the opening up of new ways of teaching that they make possible. GREIG (158) surveys critically syllabuses and examinations designed for British secondary schoolers taking a less specialized "Certificate of Secondary Education" (CSE) program. He is especially hard on minutiae of Roman and Athenian politics that are over the heads of sixteen-year-olds; lumping the Greeks and Romans together; overinsistence on relevance; and resonances of the "glory that was Greece" mentality. To HADAS (84) it is "selfish to deny knowledge of the classics [one] possesses to those who cannot read them in the original." HADAS questions "whether the ability to creep through a few hundred lines haltingly [in the original] is</page><page sequence="18">178 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 worth the strenuous effort it costs." This despite his conviction that IT work is "no substitute for language study." JAFFEE (86) calls for pursuit of both esoteric and exoteric areas in college courses, and suggests three directions in which IT courses might go; general humanities, Greco-Roman literature surveys, and limited topics (e.g. drama, philosophy). JAFFEE appends a short, useful bibliography. MILHAM (101) urges classicists not to despise "service" courses that professionals in other disciplines might require. REINHOLD and ROWLAND (114) call for "an integrated major in classical civilization," since many students "are attached to the classics because of a great interest in the cultures of the ancient world rather than primarily in the languages." SNOWDEN (121) calls survey courses a challenge that we should welcome. A college administrator (in WHITE, 131) pleads with classicists to get into the IT business for the students who will meet the classics either IT or not at all. YOUNG (136) proposes a required college survey course in Greek and Roman life and literature. Convergence with sociology is a matter touched upon earlier. Two careful statements suggest how this convergence may be effected in IT teaching. We cannot get away with sociologizing classics, says CONNOR (64), since we cannot quantify most of our information; "But if we cannot use the techniques of sociology, we cannot entirely neglect the questions it raises." "The concerns of the public man," focused upon by sociology, are topical today; and "It is precisely when we recognize the concerns of the public man that we can discover the full power of many ancient writers." PETERS (112) cautions against too close a merging of classics with sociology; classicists can use the latter to illuminate the former, but are less qualified "to treat the ancient world as providing data for the development of sociological understanding." "Neither is the sociologist's approach, on its own, likely to develop a student's outlook in an all-round way, which, it has been argued, is one of the main virtues of a classical education." Secondary school programs in humanities and introductory Greek and Roman civilization have received attention. Here I list items useful for general comments on the area; section V. D, below has articles on specific situations. KELLY (90) covers the subject best. He moves from Latin teachers' frustrations at being almost exclusively language teachers, and suggests that one area into which they can move is that of humanities or humanistic studies, an area now frequently covered by English teachers. Classicists' concern with language, asserts KELLY, is not properly an end in itself, for "As classicists we are by definition humanists," and languages should for us be "tools necessary for an encounter with the ideas and ideals of the ancient world." KELLY expands excellently on the connection between classical studies and the concept of humanitas: A humanistic education - one based on the classical maxim that the proper study of mankind is man himself- must perforce break through the walls of Lasch's "windowless room (of the current event)" liberating us from the ahistorical solipsism of an existence limited to a vision of contemporaneity. ADKINS (137) foresees a coming demand for "background courses" in Greek and Roman civilization for pupils 11 to 16, and sketches for them a suitable course. ANTCZAK (47) proposes a freshman high school course in Classical Culture. BORDEN's 50-year-old suggestions (145) regarding introduction of students to the Greeks and Romans (start with students' first-hand knowledge; begin with myths) are still sound in principle. Some articles contain cautions applicable, if not always directly addressed, to those moving into IT-course teaching. WILKINS (134), in a spirit of helpful polemic,</page><page sequence="19">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 179 concludes froml a brief analysis of literary translation that "reading the original is still the only means of studying it." ROBERTS and MORTIMER (116) print a correspondence; MORTIMER is an unabashed "antediluvian." Classics' value, he believes, is in the study of the languages, not of "people, politics, or pots"; its end- product is an ability to say what one means and understand what one hears ... And to this end any study, however diverting, of the subject mtiatter and baickgrouniid of Classical Literature, and of the Classical World in general, contributes nothing except as sugar on the intellectual pill, rendering it more palatable to the majority of students whose interests are not, or not exclusively, linguistic. ROBERTS' attempts to convert MORTIMER are presumably futile. KORF- MACHER, in supporting IT study, makes a well-intentioned but provincial suggestion: ". . . let us accept and promote 'courses in translation' as long as we ourselves are the teachers of them." Those whom the crisis in the classics depresses unduly may turn for relief to "YARRINGTON's" light series (135). DEWITT (69) offers a goal for classics and liberal arts in the post-World War 11 era: "Education for citizenship in the great world - of yesterday - today - and tomorrow." He discusses the impact exercised by changing times upon the classics and vice-versa. "The Department of Classics has an obligation to make its facilities available to as wide a range of students as possible." JOHNSON (88) cautions that unless classicists accept the invitation to teach IT courses, such offerings will fall into incompetent hands, a sentiment often expressed elsewhere as well. MURPHY (107) echoes it, with details of how the Princeton Classics Department coped in the late '40's. NELSON (108) claims IT courses as the responsibility of language departments, for it is the faculties of those departments that are best equipped, on the whole, to convey an integral understanding of various foreign cultures which the languages represent. TONGUE (127) catalogues areas where the classics department can contribute to a Liberal Arts program. CARNE-ROSS (57, 58) warns that IT work is liable to contribute to intellectual and esthetic corruption. CONNOR (66a) begins his tale with the opulent early sixties, passes on to the discovery that IT courses do not altogether drive out original language instruction, and asserts that the future of classics in the U. S. depends upon classicists' readiness to cooperate across disciplines and to master "the methods of other related fields, such as anthropology, philosophy, generative grammar, etc." GORDON (82a) proposes bridging the gap separating classicists from scientists and technologists by exploiting areas of mutual interest, with reference to his experiences at the University of Reading, England. B. RESULTS OF INQUIRIES (49, 51, 60, 62, 65, 72, 74, 79, 87, 96, 103, 113, 119, 120, 124a, 177) BABCOCK et al. (49), constituting an American Philological Association sub- commliittee, canvassedl to determiinie "how! [college] people felt about various types of cooperation [between classics and other disciplines] and what was being tried." Conclusioni: classics is doing well in some places, and the mechanics of the status quo ofteni hinder cross-disciplinary aspirations. Some correspondents saw cooperation not as a merely practical emergency measure, "but rather as a way of pumping fresh</page><page sequence="20">180 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 energy into the tradition of a liberal education with the Classics as a central, though not the only, ingredient." COLLINS (62) surveys IT courses in 286 four-year liberal arts colleges. 166 of the schools had such courses; 48 of those had taken on this type of course within the previous decade. DRAKE (74) comments on American secondary- school classics for an English readership. She notes the growing consciousness of a need for flexibility. ERICKSON (79) reports on the recent growth of classical humanities and other IT courses. JEFFREY (87) examines students' knowledge of mythology in North Texas. LATIMER (96), also known as the Airlie House Blue Book, sketches historically how the primacy of grammatical interest in nineteenth- century classical studies has contributed to the diminished role of classics in modern American education. MORFORD (103) gives a comparative overview of English and American school systems at the start of a report on classics in the U.S.A. for English readers. PRATT et al. (113) present the results of a four-year American Classical League study of the classics in humanities curricula. They note the small participation of classicists in expanding humanities programs, and cite the "Wisconsin Plan" (un- dergraduate Classical Culture courses with concentration on limited time-periods) and Great Books courses taught by interdepartmental staffs as approaches to the problem. Insofar as such courses "spread some understanding of the vitality and inmportance of the field lof classics]," the report states, they improve the campus climate for classical studies; but with few exceptions they are not known to have boosted classical language enrollments. SHERO (119) describes the rising and falling fortunes of classics in American educational history, putting the importance of currently growing numbers of IT publications in context. BARRETT (51) reports the Classical Association of Canada recommendations in the wake of a national classics enrollment plunge;. the Association "support in principle the provision in secondary schools of non-linguistic courses in Classical Studies." A closely-watched result of the recommendation, says BARRETT, is the creation of a non-linguistic secondary-level classical civilization program under the direction of LAMBERT (cf 95) at the University of Western Ontario. SWAN (124a) shows that enrollments in all classics courses in Canada climbed 25 per-cent in 1968- 73 despite sharp drops in Latin and Greek; the implication is that Canadian classicists are showing adaptability. SNOWDEN (120) describes the enthusiastic response to a survey of Great Books program directors in adult education. MASCIANTONIO and WEISLOGEL (177), after covering the rationale and im- plications of new curricular approaches, survey relevant programs, notably in Washington and Philadelphia elementary and secondary schools. This article is a handy introduction to some of the most successful experiments in classics and curricular development that are occurring anywhere. CONNOR (65) reports a two- year (1968-70) 43 per-cent jump in the number of college students taking CIT courses. "Surely," he says, "one of the most remarkable expansions in the recent history of American higher education." CLAY (60) surveys small (under 2,000 students) non-state-supported liberal arts colleges: in them, "there are only exceptionally departments of Humanities or General Civilization, and Classics represents the humanistic descipline par ex- c'llence." No one such institution stands out "as a ... guide to classicists elsewhere." CLAY approves the general view of IT courses as "bread and butter" offerings (as opposed to the "cheese and wine" of original-language courses). Programs at Reed and Dartmouth are looked at more closely. DOUGLAS MARSHALL (72), in an all-too-rare type of venture, interviews ten American school administrators, mostly from the Northeast. One of them advises the Latin teacher to "have more than one arrow in his quiver." Anthropology, history and literature are "frequently mentioned as areas through which Latin teachers might oevelop programs in western civilization." The author concludes, inter alia, that "we</page><page sequence="21">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 181 are at our strongest when justifying the study of Latin at the secondary school level as an end in itself - a unique means of introducing a student to a culture . . . " A corollary to his remarks might be that Latin as a means is supplementable by other means, such as IT courses, to achieve the cultural goal he alludes to. C. TRAINING OF CIT TEACHERS (48,49, 53, 54, 61, 65-67, 70, 73, 82, 95, 113) In the course of the 1971 APA Doctoral Program panel discussion (CONNOR, 67), the participants touch on the importance of IT courses to the college teacher. CONNOR's survey (66) of recent Classics PhD's discloses that many of them feel their own graduate programs did not do enough to prepare them for teaching un- dergraduates. BODOH (54) says that PhD programs include too little direct study of ancienit sociology, politics, economics, etc. DOLIN (70) urges graduate program directors to provide encouragement for students who wish to push out froll classics into conltiguous disciplines; even in cases where this means "a classicist lost," there is "a professor of anthropology, or English, or philosophy guinied for classics." CLEARY (61) proposes a remedy; a teaching internship for graduate students, with "teaching seminars" in the "three main areas of the Classical discipline:" original laniguage, original literature, and IT courses. The internship, adds CLEARY should in some cases be acceptable in lieu of a dissertation. In response to the above-mentioned panelists, GOOLD (82) confesses discomfort at preoccupation with "professionalism." He tells DOLIN, BODOH, and CLEARY that once we "recognize that ouI- study of classics springs purely and directly from the most divine, though deep-seated, of all human drives, the drive to gratify the self with knowledge," teacher-training proposals will be exposed as useless. One surely hopes that classicists are under the divine stimulus that GOOLD describes. At the sam2 time, we have a right to expect that a person so conlscious as GOOLD of the need for r igorous attention to method and technique in the pursuit of truth should tell us why simiilar meticulous rigor is not required in the business of learning how to com- municate the truth to others. Elsewhere, REINHOLD and ROWLAND ( 113) discuss how, for mnany prospective teachers, progranms of greater breadth must replace orthodox PhD degrees, and LAMBERT (95) sketches his own plans for establishing curriculum-and-methods coursework for secondary school teachers. CONNOR (65) describes the emergence of a "new profession:" The classicist has become the interpreter of English versions of the Classics to large numbers of students rather than a philologist whose only or greatest duty is to teach the gramnmar and style of the Latin or Greek languages. BODOH (53) reports on a recently-approved Master of Arts degree in Classical Humianities at Texas Tech University, including graduate courses both in the original anid IT, designed to equip high school and junior college teachers to offer a range of Latin anid classical civilization courses. ATKINS (48) sketches, in an annex to an APA comnmittee report, desirable characteristics of a scholar-teacher: The classicist must strive for a comprehensive view of his subject as a scientist, as a social scientist, and as a humanist. . . . at least one of his pursuits . . . is the quest for a comprehension of man, his setting, his activities, particularly his moral conduct. ATKINS pr)oposes broadening of subject matter, limiiiting of specialization, and provision for courses in areas other than classics in graduate training. Readers who</page><page sequence="22">182 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 enjoy sarcastic invective should see DOW's reply (73) to ATKINS. While CIT is not dealt with directly in this mid-fifties exchange, there is much discussion of the virtues (or vices) that have since been identified with a sympathetic attitude toward CIT teaching. D. CIT AND CURRICULA: SPECIFIC SITUATIONS (44,46,50-52,55,63, 80a, 83, 88a, 91, 94, 98, 99, 105, 106, 111, 125, 126, 129, 132, 133, 142, 177, 196) (Note: The appearance of some articles here rather than in VI, below, may seem arbitrary. I have attempted to gather here items in which the shape of the curriculum, or the relationship of a specific course to a curriculum, was a greater concern than the description of a single course in se. The line was not always easy to draw.) Elenmentanr atid secondary school: The Philadelphia Foreign Language in Elementary School (FLES) program, in Latin and Greek, reported on in MASCIANTONIO and WEISLOGEL (177) includes a series of cultural goals: awareness of the classical impact in art, archaeology, government, law and other areas; an understanding of diversities within a society; an awareness of the differences between classical and nmodern civilization; an understanding of the evolution of our culture; and interest in the study of classics and the humanities. At the same time the Philadelphia school district has initiated curricular development of a comprehensive interdisciplinary classical humanities program, involving a series of courses and mini-courses on various topics, such as Africa in Classical Antiquity, ethnomusicology, socio-political problems in classical antiquity, and the classical heritage in America. (The program is also described in 45.) They also discuss curriculum developments elsewhere. An English pamphlet (46) focuses on one- or two- year foundation classics courses for all classics secondary (ages 1 1 to 16) students, to be followed by branching off into original language courses for some and more IT work for others. The pamphlet recommends that the foundation course be calculated to stimulate, and recommends less emphasis on examinations as a means to greater flexibility. It then briefly describes the Cambridge School Classics Project (CSCP), begun in early 1966 and designed both to improve Latin teaching and to introduce students to the classical heritage. It also speaks well of comparative ancient-modern and classical influences courses for non-advanced level sixth form work. MORTON (106) provides further historical background to the CSCP. LAMBERT (94) gives an introduction to the CSCP. To the question where the classics belong in a secondary school now, LAM- BERT says that the Project has a reply; the classicist is to get involved in general education, not just in exchange with an elite. In a survey of classics' role in reorganized English secondary education, THOMPSON (126) suggests a two-year "Classical Knowledge" course in junior high school, PECKETT (1I 1) wishes junior high school humanities courses to cover the aspects of Greco-Roman culture which "became the bases of Western Christian civilization, and MORTON (105) tells how classics was overlooked in the developing Certificate of Secondary Education program (for students of modeh ate ability) everywhere except in the East Midlands, whose syllabuses in Latin and in Greek and Roman life and literature he describes. BARRETT (51) relates plans for classical civilization curriculum development as a response to Canada's falling classics enrollments. MAURER (99) reports oli a large new federal grant to the National Humanities Faculty to "assist schools in making substantive changes and improvements in humanities instruction." The NHF makes literature and personnel available to high schools for consultation. The Ontario Classical Association Committee (63) reports a government-directed project for publishing guidelines for Greek and Roman civilization in English "in</page><page sequence="23">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 183 response to the growing popularity and evident value of units and courses that can collectively be called Classical Humanities." The article alludes also to the CSCP, and laments the damage done by past elitism. SWITALA (125) gives an all-too-short description of the broad use of classics outside the Latin program in Bethel Park (Pa.) Senior High School. A follow-up article, with more details on the strengths, weaknesses, successes, and failures of this varied program, is merited. Junior college: "Regrettably, no 'model' programs in junior colleges have come to our attention" (MASCIANTONIO and WEISLOGEL, 177). References to IT activity in this area are indeed sparse. ANDERSON (44) advocates IT "foreign study" courses to replace languages for those in two-year schools who will not benefit from languages, and notes that his school (Montgomery City Community College, Pa.) hopes to launch such courses soon. BENEDICT (142) recounts teaching, in a college of mining and technology, a course called "Problems and Ideas in Literature," which was "originally planned to provide an opportunity for students to develop some facility, and hence sonie confidence, in handling verbal abstractions. . . " It came to have as its objective "through the reading of classical and modern authors, to demonstrate the non- conteniporaneous nature of the particular problem or idea considered" (out of a series of problems).FISCHER (80a) applies to junior college education Einstein's warning that science cannot furnish aims. Humanities has a place in junior college since there, as everywhere, "education cannot be merely an accretion of knowledge nor a pursuit of formalistic program patterns, but must be an activity geared to exploration and intellectual creativity." This means not bodily transplanting university-style humanities courses, but "a humanistic approach to all the disciplines," including even drafting and design, business and marketing. Yet FISCHER also sees room for CIT and "courses dealing with, e.g., myth, fantasy, and science fiction and myth, folklore and literature." College and university: See also V.A., above. Several course- and curriculum- descriptions focus on the place of classics in curricula. Two, WHITE (132) and BOWLING (55), are of interest for their early date. WHITE mentions a series of Ancient World IT courses developed in response to a Yale committee report asserting that the college's classics requirement "should help to provide, among other things, the historical perspective which is the enemy of temporal provincialism," and leaving roonm for fulfillment of this objective through IT courses. BOWLING tells of an in- coming BA basic requirement of six hours in "classical culture" (Latin and Greek optional) at Washington University, Saint Louis: ... it was the point of view of [the courses and curricula committee] that college students had a considerable interest in the civilization of Greece and Rome but that this interest had not always been satisfied by the conventional approach to the study of Greek and Latin. In a new full degree course in Classical Studies at University College, Cardiff, Wales, a student will devote half his work to languages and half "to a non-linguistic study of antiquity" (WALCOT, 129). WALCOT's 'escription of the program concludes with a conscious non-apology: lt one ot our main aims is to persuade others to think effectively, there is no doubt that Classical Studies stimulates thought, and that it does this no less successfully than any other subject ... [Classical Studies] must be accepted for what it is and not as . . . an inferior substitute . . . for Classics. BARRETT's short but useful article (52) aims "to indicate some of the main ways in which teachers are working to ensure [the classics'] survival." He mentions the</page><page sequence="24">184 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 "modern classicist's" abandonment of mental discipline and transfer-of-training objectives, and his concern to disclose the sources of modern culture which are to be found in the classical world. His picture of the rising role of CIT courses in the University of Sussex' flexible new "Schools of Studies" structure is worth looking at. BARRETT mentions events in Cardiff, New Zealand, and Denmark, as well as providing comments and references for other places on the map. MARTYN (98) calls all IT course at Melbourne University a "striking innovation." WIGHT (133) expands on classics work at Sussex (cf. notes on 52, above), which is divided between major study and CIT taught as part of a "broad background to (students') particular discipline, organized by the school they have chosen to belong to." Appropriate great books, read in translation, are part of the prescribed study in each of the Schools. WIGHT commends the system for its "advantages for the ordinary mediocre student," in a rare bow to that segment of the audience. BALDWIN (50) reports on a 16-fold increase in classics students at Calgary. "Trendiness tor its own sake" is resisted. Staple offerings are Classical Mythology and Ancient Technology. "There is no 'sacrifice of standards,' merely the following of limited and realistic goals." KIEFFER (91) describes the Great Books Program at St. John's College, Annapolis. Acknowledging that "the specialized aims of the modern departnment of Classics are alien to the St. John's concept of liberal education," he describes the broad IT reading of Latin and Greek authors in the first year-plus of the program: We do not read them as in an historical setting or as representative of Greek culture, but as possessions of the contemporary world, com- menting on questions that are contemporary because they do not change. His reply to the charge of superficiality: ". . . among the marks of a classic are the quality of its surface and the organic relation between surface and depth." It should be noted that all students have a year each of Greek and Latin. GRANT and RIESMAN's critical appraisal (83) shows how little the St. John's program has chaniged in the 25 years since KIEFFER's remarks. GRANT and RIESMAN note, inter alia, the failure "to discuss the social context of the Great Books." The school is blanmed for "oppressive ... dogmatism" and praised for having "kept alive an ideal of the liber-al arts and a concern for the wholeness of the intellectual experience in a pure form.'" ULLMAN (196), laying upon college faculty and administrators the "duty to see to it that a large part of their student body come into contact with ancient civilizationi," tells of programs at Princeton, Yale, Columbia and elsewhere designed to meet said responsibility in the pre-World War I1 era. JOHNSTON (88a) calls at- tention to classics courses as overlooked opportunities in adult education, where he sees a varied and potentially large audience. VI.

GENERAL COURSES (137, 140, 145, 151, 157, 158, 161, 168, 171, 178, 180, 191, 192,192a, 196, 199) High school: ADKINS (137) sketches "a course which will communicate to the pupils [age 11 and up] who do not know the languages the maximum benefit ... they are capable of deriving." Proceed, he advises, from the concrete and the tangible; e.g. fronm Greek geography io the political realities arising therefrom. Do not assume that such an introductory course is necessarily related to a "next" course; it can be self- contained, meaningful whole. Civilization courses, well taught, "combine familiarity with strangeness, remoteness with transnmitted historical effect." ASHBRIDGE (140) describes an introduction to the Greco-Roman world through projects, translations, and visuals for children age 13 to 14, some (but not all) of whom will go on to Latin. Presentationi is not strictly chronological; 432 B.C. is an "anchor," and the Greek way of life of that time is studied "from as many points of view as possible." Detailed descriptions of method are provided. BORDEN's suggestions (145) include two worth noting; direct students to con- temporary examples of classical architecture, and study classical myths in an in- troductory course. GRAY (157), doubting (in 1925) whether high school Greek courses can provide the broad cultural values claimed for them, describes a one- semester Greek culture course preparatory to study of the language. Geography and myvth are the startinig points. GREIG (158). pondering the future of the (English) Certificate of Secondary Education in Classics, examines critically CSE classics syllabuses and papers, 1965-73. He objects to abstruse questions, to lumping "Greeks and Romans" together, to overinsistence on relevance, and to the "glory that was Greece" approach. One misses a proposal of positive alternatives after these valid complaints. HOETKER (161) urges analysis of classroom practice to determine whether we are fostering behavior of the kind expected of a "liberally educated man." In suggesting the behavioral-objective approach for humanists, he recommends: 1) avoidance of specifics related to what the student can do at once as a result of com- pleting a unit; 2) caution against defining behavior too narrowly. The article is a sensible approach to the difficult problem whether and to what degree the results of humanities courses are measurable and describable. KOVACH (168) describes Latin /- humanities courses taught in Detroit and Washington high schools, and suggests a two-semester Classical Heritage course for Latinless 11th and 12th grade students. SCHORK (191) reports on a semester-long, ten-lecture spare time course offered to Washington, D.C., high school students. He adds much practical advice; e.g. present detailed lecture outlines, and "be willing, occasionally, to sacrifice textual accuracy to emotive impact," in which connection Logue's Homer is approved. SCHUMACHER (192) assesses confidently the potential for comparative ancient-modern study in high school classics courses. Language teachers are urged to become "interpreters of Greco-Roman culture," and to deal with issues such as bribery, ecology, ghettoes, famine. SHARP (192a) pleads for first- form instructors to ask themselves not, " 'How can I best get over to my pupils the achievements of Greece and Rome,' but 'What are the educational needs of children in the eleven-to-thirteen age group' and 'How can I, who happen to have a classical training, play a part in meeting those needs?' " His comments on his own course</page><page sequence="28">188 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 emphasize play-acting techniques, and include a valuable sample reading- comprehension exam. WEDDERSPOON (199) presents a detailed Classical Civilization course outline for eleventh graders, starting commendably with an examination of the nature of the sources. Juniior college: LUEKER (171) deals with "one" rather broad objective in teaching classics: "the comprehension of thoughts and ideas and the perception of esthetic values." Despite occasional vagueness he grapples with the real problems, and is bold enough to envision (or to admit he envisions) courses that involve reading both in the original and IT. He agrees with ADKINS (137) that courses should be independently valuable. College and University: DARBY (151) describes a ten-week elective called Classical Studies, for College of Education students; a three-year Classical Studies course as a qualifying sequence for the (English) Certificate in Education; and an extended (7pp.) outline of the latter course. MILHAM (178) describes a University of Neweu Brunswick course with three purposes: to complement both classical and modern studies, to integrate classical with medieval and modern history and literature and with history of science courses, and to compensate for deficiencies in the University in comparative literature. She outlines a two-term humanities course from Hellenistic Thought to Christian Literature and Philosophy. MONTGOMERY (180) describes a post-World War II semester comparison of Greek culture (550-350 B.C.) with Rome (50 B.C.-A.D. 50), built on the premise that "College education should provide [core courses] that teach how to understand the present in terms of the past." ULLMAN (196) describes large-audience courses at Princeton, Yale, Columbia and elsewhere. B. LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION (134, 139, 152, 155, 163, 172, 194, 197) ALLEN's advice to the college LIT teacher (139) must be read with discretion. IT courses both reach the Latinless student and help create a favorable campus climate for classics. Division of material by genre is preferred to separation of Latin from Greek sources, and careful coverage of limited material is better than extensive reading for its own sake. As a confirmed specialist, ALLEN dislikes excursions into "modern economics, politics, and sociology" as out of his area of competence; he cautions, "Be sparing of comparisons with the modern world." Yet, he admits reluctantly, "it will be necessary to dabble in literary criticism" since a student has a right to ask a teacher why a classic is good. He gives examples of use of current criticism from journals. One's impression from the article is that the classicist's professional conscientiousness should hinder him from presenting ancient LIT as integratable with students' other experiences. ALLEN considers the modernness of translations unimportant, since "the older translations may actually be easier to understand." A fervent piece by DORSEY (152) presents a polar opposite to ALLEN's careful drawing of disciplinary boundaries: l he greatest use for courses in literature in translation at this juncture in our history (1969) must be to reveal conceptual, aesthetic, and especially ethical alternatives to the . . . American way of life . . . For this purpose, the studied culture must be contrasted with our own - starkly, subtly, suavely, or shockingly . . . I am arguing for . . . a course which, while helping to introduce the student to the process of literary analysis, will concentrate on revealing the variety, complexity, and beauty of man's response to the human condition.</page><page sequence="29">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 189 FISCHER's exhortationi against gloom (155), though short on detail regarding his enithLusiastically r eceived LIT course, is of significance as one of the few junior-college- related itemiis founld. JACOBSEN (163) describes a three-year, once-weekly, com- pulsory COUrse for non-classics specialists in Danish gymnasia (ages 16 to 19). JOHNSON (134) writes of his own "Great Books of Greece and Rome" course at 1 LiftS, in which only three classics are read in concentration per semester. TARRANT'S (194) valuable pamphlet criticizes only translations with a claim to literary merit"; hence he excludes all prose renderings. He also omits Pound-type "imilitationis" of ancient poetry. "The editions have been evaluated from only one stanidpoiilt, their suitability as texts for the study of ancient poetry." ULLMAN and ALLEN (197) emphasize that LIT is best with a "highly individualized" style of teachinig, anid with an awareness that the student "sees the material through the mind ot the teachier." MARGON (172) calls attention to, and provides pointers on, the problemils posed by using a translation; and he urges interest in current literary ci-iticislis, providing bibliography. C. GREEK LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION (138, 146, 169, 170) AGARD (138), onl the premise that "The classics have always been of most value when they have been used to guide the present," sets out ideas for treating three themes in Greek literature: avoidance of hvbris, sophrosyne, and freedom. BOWEN (146) deals with Greek LIT at Hockaday Junior College, Dallas. She recommends The Odi'ssev' as a character-builder; Connelly's 7he Greeni Pastures as "a modern illustrationi of Homeric anthropomorphism"; and Millay, Wilder, Eugene O'Neill, Gertrude Stein and others as contemporary artists comparable to ancient writers. Her instinct for emphasizing literary continuity is still imitable. LEINIEKS (169), replying to DORSEY (152; cf. above, VI. B), prefers to organize a Greek LIT course around "the comimiloIn stock of ideas which were used in literary composition from Homer to the end of the fifth century B.C." such as "the idea of a hero's specific character," manl-god relationships, the danger ot ambition. Nor, adds LEINIEKS, "is it necessary to go into political or cultural history beyond what is found in the works themselves." In (1 70) LEINIEKS re-emphasizes the study of Greek ideas as central. He suggests divisioni of the course by works, confines himself to epic, lyric, and drama, and adds a short bibliogr-aplhy. D. MYTHOLOGY (144, 147, 148, 166, 173-175, 181, 186, 190) PERADOTTO (185) is now indispensable. He has "placed priniary importance on listing titles which would carry the instructor and student of classical mythology, on the subject matter's own inevitable momentum, beyond the boundary lines which have traditionally defined it into areas of interest not always the wonted haunt of classicists." Thuis the section-headings include "Myth and Psychology." "Myth and Anthropology," "The Structural Study of Myth," etc. BONNER (144) cites advances in anthropology and archaeology as capable of adding interest to the myths, and uses the mlyth course as an introduction to the understanciing of myth generally and of folklore. BROEGE (147) categorizes by sub-type classical myths involving women and brietly menitions modertn creative works, especially novels, which exhibit the same sub-types. Her article will be valuable for opening doors to comparative material, rather than foI careful analysis of just how parallels between ancient and modern works are to be used. The same may be said of BROEGE's 148. KENNA (166) cites the importance of Dumezil, Malinowski, Leach and others in the study of myth, and emphasizes the anthropologist's instinct to look at the parts of a culture as inteirelated. She notes some classical applicabilities of Levi-Strauss' ideas, atid preters the study of "what myth does and what nmyth says" over treatment</page><page sequence="30">190 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 of myth as evidence of "primitive, irrational and prelogical mentality" in people of "previous stages in social evolution." This bibliography-strewn article will be of use to any reader. The same may be said of MARSHAK's series of pieces (173, 174, 175): In (173) she summarizes: the general theory of the Jungian archetypes will be presented . . . [in] barest outline . . . In the second . .. I will try to illustrate Jung's view that myths represent psychological facts, using some of the Classical myths. In the third . . ., I will discuss mythology and the theory of archetypes in relation to children's development and thereby their relevance to the educational process. Myth, says MARSHAK (175) has among its aims to carry man across thresholds among the stages of life; the "experience of separation and division is the major ingredient all along the continuance of psychological growth," and is represented in myth. This eminently readable and richly suggestive series is concerned with theory rather than technique. MOORE (181) aims "to stimulate an appreciation of the importance of the Myth of the Archetypal Hero with its especial application to primary school drama." There follows an engaging description of a mime-and- movement classroom portrayal of events in Perseus' career, of which exercise MOORE says, "I believe . . . I intuitively activated an archetypal group experience and, from further research [I believe] that primary-school children are at an age when they are most susceptible to the influence of psychic evolution." More study is needed, MOORE acknowledges. His experience suggests that more study is certainly merited. PIANT's approach (186) to an introductory high school mythology course involves eight to ten introductory lessons on "meaning, sources, and objectives" of mythology to overcome initial "ridicule" and "bewilderment," during which students read about Homer, Aeschylus, Vergil, etc. One might wish the same objectives were achievable by proceeding more directly to the primary sources. PIANT gives further details on subjects covered and work assigned. SCHORK (190) assesses myth as representing "creative imagination," dis- tinguished from "discursive logic," and identifies characteristics of myth which "can provide a valuable critical context for an academic investigation of the literary products of the ancient world which has as its prime emphasis their mythical (as opposed to, for example, their tragic) dimensions." After discussing the advantages of presenting mythology "from the perspective of its function as a highly idiomatic language," he concludes with a description of the type of mythology survey he en- dorses, with plenty of bibliography, in which Grant's Myths of the Greeks and Romans gets pride of place. E. ANCIENT HISTORY (128, 141, 149, 154, 159, 160, 182, 187, 200; cf. 209, 255, cited in VII. B. See also the "Lactor" Pamphlet Series cited in II, under Didaskalos) BALCER (141) provides detailed discussion of problems of substance. He notes progress in the appreciation of Greek history as a phenomenon continuous both with earlier history and with events in areas surrounding the Greek peninsula, notably Anatolia. He includes a course outline titled "The Nature of the Athenian Polis." CHAMBERS (149) presents an interpretive study of Greek history (Minoans to Alexander), with a following five-page bibliography. GRUEN's pamphlet (159) does the same for the Roman Republic, with ten pages of bibliography. FINLEY's com- ments (154), though not aimed at the IT teacher, will help him get a perspective; the study of ancient history, FINLEY emphasizes,</page><page sequence="31">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 191 should serve to enrich the student's understanding of society, politics, and culture in terms of and in the interests of, their own experience and ultimately of the situations they will face in our society. HAWORTH (160) provides a Greek history syllabus with bibliography and specimen test. MURPHY (182) provides a superficial narrative of what he teaches in the Roman Politics course he describes. (A characteristic example: "With the rise of Marius, I stress the importance of the army in Roman politics.") A series of topic-headings, with source readings related to them point by point (for an example, see BERMAN, 143), would have been better than the narrative. There are no comments on technique. The audience POHLSANDER (187) has in mind is not clear. His text includes many substantive observations of the obvious, along with comments that rather presume close acquaintance with the facts. The teacher, he states, must observe Bengtson's remark that "chronology has been called the eye of history"; POHLSANDER then proceeds as though unaware that he has opened a problem. (How are chronological and topical approaches to be reconciled?) URWIN (128) suggests a course in Ancient and Classical History, with emphasis on society, culture, and politics. (See also comments on 128, above). YEO (200) gives a thumbnail coverage of salient facts and dates, but does not have the scope afforded GRUEN (159) for describing problems in the use of sources, nor for annotations to the bibliography such as GRUEN provides. F. MISCELLANEOUS CLASSICS COURSES (143, 146a, 148, 150, 153, 156, 162a, 167, 176, 179. 188, 189, 194a, 195, 198, 201) High school and earlier: BRADSHAW (146a) describes, inter alia, a successful weekly mythology-teaching visit by his Latin IV students to a nearby junior high school. In the course of describing her own program, CHAMPLIN (150) strews noteworthy remarks on what has worked for her, for example staging of Antigone and Amphitryo (she had creative writing students fill in the Act IV lacuna of the latter play), a "seminar" on the life and times of Socrates involving papers on various aspects of Athenian life, and a contemplated re-trial of Socrates. KNIGHT (167) describes an unusual two-hour-daily Humanities course for "academically able" seventh-graders, involving "literature, English, and Latin," whose unifying theme is "a search for the hero. Who is he? What is his culture? His ethic? How does he relate to a twelve-year- old student living in California today?" MASCIANTONIO (176) notes briefly "Africa in Classical Antiquity," a syllabus designed for the Philadelphia schools. (See also V. D, above, on 177.) YEOMANS (201), in "immersing" his eighth-grade social studies class in Athenian life and thought, aims to have his students "become Athenians," and thereby become better acquainted with their own society. Anicient philosophy: FARRINGTON (153) provides a substantive chronological- development survey with bibliography. MINAR (179) notes with approval how the study of Greek and Roman philosophy has been affected by the "modern trend in classical studies . . . to try to see ancient culture as a unity." His comments on how to teach the course admirably emphasize that one should prefer the stimulation of critical thought to the accumulation of factual knowledge. Anicienit techhnology: See also BROEGE 148 (cited above, VI.D). WALBANK and HUMPHREY (198) focus on selected Mesolithic through Bronze Age sites, assign essays among which the topic "survival" is notably popular, and draw liberal arts, social science, and education students as well as the engineers for whom the course was created. Classical archaeology: THOMPSON (195) discusses archaeology both as a separate</page><page sequence="32">192 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 course and, in a particularly valuable sequence, as a supplement to history and civilization courses, with efficient application of the bibliography to all the details suggested. Drama: See also VII.E, below. SCHLESINGER (189) encourages the study of ancient plays in their own contemporary context rather than as "timeless master- pieces": "The ultimate value of such study of 'content' results from discovering and testing one's own presuppositions by comparison." There are specific and sensible comments on problems of substance in presenting plays. Latinz literature in translation: GEORGE (156) stresses the importance of distinguishing aspects of literature that are easily teachable in LIT courses from those that are not, recommends an attempt to cover all periods of Latin literature through the Medieval, and includes an author-by-author bibliography. Women in antiquity: BERMAN's description of her course (143), coordinating topic- headings with source-readings, is a methodological model for articles of this type. Her outline, called "merely a rough guide," is both topical and chronological; her key to success, she notes, is reliance on class discussion and informality of presentation; and her bibliography is short and good. Arethusa 6.1 (Spring 1973) is an issue on Women in Antiquity. In addition to POMEROY (188), there are articles on Women in Early Greece, Greek attitudes to sexual behavior, Plato and women, Etruscan women, counter-cultural feminism in Roman elegy, and abortion in antiquity. Other courses: HOUSTON (162a) focuses on four brief periods of Rome's history, using the topic as a microcosmic introduction to the study of Europe and as a vehicle for student experience in analysis and expression of reactions. Four weeks of HOUSTON's syllabus are presented in great detail. TEBBEN (194a) describes the efficiency and flexibility of an Ohio State University course for students in health- related fields. G. OTHER RELEVANT ARTICLES (148a, 162, 162b, 165, 166a, 183, 183a, 184, 184a, 193) KLEIN (166a) offers a thumbnail description of Freud's theories and terminology, citing some samples of psychoanalytic literature on the classics; cf. also GLENN (222). CALDWELL (148a) intends "a representative and fairly inclusive list of books and articles which apply psychoanalytic theory to classical studies," with the assumption that "inclusion is more important than cursory evaluation." Still his article is liberal with critical notes, and more comprehensive and systematic than KLEIN's. HOLSINGER (162) details a successful classics radio series, which drew for par- ticipants upon a variety of Ohio State University departments. A brief notice cannot do justice to HUMPHREY (162b), who follows a pithy history of anthropologist- classicist relationships with three suggested areas of potential cooperation between the disciplines: the "effort to tighten up our reasoning about numbers and economic/ecological data," "reasoning about institutions" as practiced by M. I. Finley and others, and "the structuralist analysis of myth and ritual." The ap- proaches here represented assume "that the datum [the researcher] is considering can only be defined and understood in terms of the relationships which link it to other data." KALBOUSS' description (165) of an introductory Russian culture course may help classicists methodologically; the course explores how Russia's most creative novelists, poets, painters, architects, and composers expressed their experiences in the context of their en-</page><page sequence="33">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 193 vironment. Rather than tackle the monumental and absurd task of fusing all the disciplines involved in Russian studies, this course has set out to provide models in the form of lectures and presentations of how one would go about understanding the relationship between the arts and the social environment in which they were conceived. MURPHY (183) details a two-semester elective course, a cooperative product of four departments, on the theme of freedom, relying on Arnold's Hebraism /Hellenism polarity. The list of constantly reappearing discussion ideas (fate and providence, evil and suffering, etc.) and other observations make the article worth consulting. MURRAY (183a) suggests a study of the Ancient-Modern quarrel as a way to help "explain the division of our cultural life into the separate disciplines, scientific and humanistic." NATUNEWICZ (184), describing a series of five-minute programs done for a commercial Maryland radio station, sets out a motley list of engaging topics (Apollo 1 1 and Lucian's True History; Theophrastean antecedents of the Kindhearted Prostitute; and on) and reminds the reader of the value of contact with the general public. PADGUG (184a) covers works written in (or translated into) Western European languages "which demonstrate the value of a specifically Marxist ap- proach." Thus "works of an historical, social or economic character have received far greater attention than those which are literary or artistic in approach, although ex- cellent work has been done in the latter area." PADGUG disclaims "universal ex- pertise." STRAY (193) treats the "theoretical foundations and practical details of a thematically organized education syllabus" based on Greek, Roman, and Victorian English societies, for use with adult classes.

D) NORTON (236) comments on what is available as reflected in SCHOENHEIM'S Booklist and lists desiderata: anthologies fusing disciplines (e.g. sociology-and-the- classics); collections by genre in satire, biography and other areas comparable to those available in epic, drama, and lyric; and more source-books gathered by discipline. She remarks further (237) on scarcities among IT course materials. REXINE (245) provides a "representative" list of recent mythology books (see now PERADOTTO, 185); Grant's Myths of'the Greeks and Romans is again singled out. McGUIRE (231) includes bibliographies on selected aspects of Roman civilization. COLEBOURNE and CLEEVE (213) are especially useful on the history and criticism of literature. Since they write for a British audience, some handy American titles are missing. In historical fiction, HERBERT (223) reviews eight "representative" (1957) novels, BEALL (208) provides several hundred titles with one- to six-word descriptions of their suitability for ninth graders, and RIDINGTON (246, 247) continues to keep readers up to date with reviews that are both descriptive and critical. McCARTNEY (230), supplemented by CRUM (214), provides titles in superstition, magic, and other avenues to Greek and Roman folklore, which will be of special interest in teaching "deep culture." B. TECHNIQUES AND METHODS, MISCELLANEOUS (202, 209, 210, 215, 220, 220a, 221, 224, 226-229, 232, 232a, 238-240, 248, 251a, 253-258) ALLEN (202) proposes to remedy the vagueness of articles on teaching CIT, provides summary outlines for a half-dozen IT courses (e.g. Greek and Latin epic, Greek and Roman historians), and adds suggestions on exams, audiovisuals, and types of course the starting teacher should attempt. CARLSON (210), offering to "clarify and enlighten" rather than enshrine a method, discusses, with mixed results, three approaches to teaching the classics; the historical, the new critical, and the comparative. Writing on the presentation of Ancient History, BRYANT (209) affirms the greater relevance of an "emphasis . .. on narrative history" (e.g. what Luther did, how Napoleon rose and fell) "rather than the analysis of the historical process," and notes that "history is an enquiry into what each age sees as the significant past." VON LEYDEN (255) on the other hand, believes that the historical process "may be said to become known in its depth or 'spread' only if viewed imaginatively from standpoints outside the actual present." He advises that there are ways in which the notion of historical progress is unsatisfactory, and urges study of individual cases rather than a</page><page sequence="36">196 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 search for an overall upward or downward movement in history. KILGOUR (226), in one of the best introductions to IT courses reviewed here, begins by acknowledging the coming importance of classical civilization study both in language courses and "in general or common courses in the early stages of secondary school." He deals with "problems associated with content and method" and follows with a wealth of ideas, among which are these: ... the method ... of giving the pupils some guidance and allowing them thereafter to develop the topic by their own efforts is the basic procedure for the teaching of civilization. Oral exposition is "the least profitable way" to teach ancient history. "Intensive study of short periods" with "line of development" studies, the latter centered around such topics as "political and military matters . . . dress, houses, education, entertainments ... in short, the social life of the period" should be pursued. Study of a "patch," an area approached from several disciplinary directions (an actual "Mediterranean patch" uniting English, History, and Geography and coupled with a study of the city of Aberdeen is described) receives approval. Though KILGOUR aims principally at high school teachers, he appears to have the college-teaching audience in mind as well. LAWTON (228), discussing possible forms of team-teaching that may be applied to Foundations Courses in Classical Studies, concludes that flexibility - both in the size of groups and in the length of tasks - is the greatest advantage of this approach. PORTER (239), in a stimulating and solid article, describes a Socratic approach to teaching LIT: 1) the instructor poses a problem but resolutely refuses to give an answer to it; 2) he provides the student with materials and tools by which he can find his own answer; 3) he encourages or requires the student to come up with his own solution. He then details technically some ways of applying the principle. Among the techniques is one in which the instructor "urges the students to adopt toward the classics the stance of the artist rather than that of the critic," and directs them to creative responses. WATTS' experience (256) with five-student groups of mixed ability (ages II to 15) suggests that beneficial cooperation experiences can replace competition, provided there is careful teacher management. The article does not point directly to classics, buLt the applications are obvious. TAYLOR's critical reply (253) concentrates on a listing of problems connected with group-learning, and is unfortunately short on practical suggestions for solutions. LONG (229) suggests materials and procedures for use in secondary school projects generally. There are specific suggestions for high school IT teachers. GAY (221) proposes a classical museum in a high school, composed of both genuine antiquities and student creations. FRIES (220) tells why Ovid should be prominent in a classical humanities curriculum: he is a source for the courtly love tradition; he "was the first love poet to treat woman as an equal"; he is responsible for the Don Juan theme in Western literature. PERRY (238) compares the form and content of ancient tragedy and grand opera. SAYLOR (248), in an article whose technique is suggestive, finds thematic parallels between Buck, the co-hero of "Midnight Cowboy," and Seneca's Hippolytus. Two articles discuss the use of original Greek in the IT course. PORTER (240) expounds on terms (e.g. ionios, ate), comments on the possibilities open to the user of a highly inflected language but not to his translator, and essays to convey the "beauty of sound" of Greek poetry and a sense of the characteristic effects of different metres. lHis experiment in teaching a little Greek (30-40 nouns and adjectives, 10 verbs, Iliad</page><page sequence="37">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 197 1.1-7 with elaborate commentary) merits attention. WILSON (257) holds that the sound of the original can aid the student in understanding its intended effect. TODD (254) attends to the classics as taught to children under eleven. He lists suitable stories (Horatius, Atalanta), urges attention to persons and tales rather than "An age, a period, a movement, an institution," and suggests workable themes (e.g. slavery, the sea). Vergil is the center of several applicable articles. WORKMAN (258) details, in a short but well-done piece, a freshman-sophomore college course titled "Human Destiny in Vergil's Aeneid." Vergil's works were read thoroughly, his ideas separated from those of other ancients, and the ideas handled were then criticized in the light of the students' own experience. The intensive study of one work, as opposed to a survey course, represents to WORKMAN "a return to the type of education prevalent in the Renaissance, when one or another central classic out of classical antiquity came in for intensive and vigorous study . . . " MENCH (233) offers a provocative series of illustrations that Vergil's visual techniques in epic resemble those of cinema. MANDL's suggestions (232) of background music for high school study of the Aeneid range from Schubert to the Ben-Hur soundtrack. KURZ (227) uses a range of CIT readings to supplement work on the Aeneid by his high school seniors. Degree or type of relationship between the works chosen and the Aeneid is apparently unimportant. FROHNE (220a) discusses a six-day, all-day series of activities, some of them unusual (Vitruvius on frescoes; Goethe's Italienische Reise) centering on Pompeii. MASSEY (232a) offers some practical suggestions for handling special projects. SMITH (251a) considers the use of writing with students age 11-13 not merely as a final product of activity, but also as "a way of shaping both present and prior experience so that they fit more comfortably together." Finally DOW (215) has suggestions for coordinating speech and visual effects in a multi-projector slide presentation, and JEFFREY (224) cites Homer, Lucian, and linguistic history among sources for humorous material. C. EXAMINATIONS WITH SYLLABUSES (202 through 207) The Didaskalos series titles, numbered above, are mostly self-explanatory; "0- Level" means "ordinary," "A-Level" "advanced." D. TECHNIQUES IN LITERARY CRITICISM (225, 235, 241, 242, 249) See COLEBOURNE and CLEEVE (213, cited in VII. A) and MARGON (172, cited in VI. B). MUIR (235) lists some useful recent works, centering on Latin more than Greek, and with articles from Greece and Rome and Arion. KAES and OFFSTEIN (225) report an unusual college experiment in teaching Brecht IT, in which the students made their own collection of philosophical, literary, and historical background to the playwright. CARNEY (211) outlines a technique for "objectively and systematically making inferences from communications." FORREST (219), writing in 1955, essays "to chart the way for the classicist not familiar with the [New Criticism] movement," which he calls a middle ground between positivism and im- pressionism. Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry heads his booklist. QUINN (241, 242) urges a focus on the right questions to ask of a text, primarily: What does the author say? Why? How? He counsels (242) "responsive interrogation of the text, guided by a study of the political, sociological, literary and intellectual circumstances," and insists that "The unimaginative interpretation of a letter, a treaty, or a poem isn't just a more limited interpretation; it is usually ... historically wrong ... Psychoanalytic and structuralist approaches will deal with aspects of literature that are accessible in IT courses. GLENN's bibliography (222) on the former topic has 65</page><page sequence="38">198 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1975 annotated items. SEGAL's study (250) shows the working of a structuralist approach in one instance. E. TECHNIQUES IN DRAMA (212, 217, 218, 243, 244) CLAY (212) outlines an approach to staging the Anitigone which emphasizes the political background. RAEBURN, in a carefully-considered study (243, 244), provides an excellent guide to issues a schoolteacher faces in arranging a two-hour student drama production. Effect, he recommends (243), a synthesis between extremes of reconstructing conditions of the time of the original and adopting modern theatrical conditions as far as possible. Phases in the stereotyped structure of tragedy should be thought of much as musical movements. And more; unity and simplicity mark RAEBURN's idea of a successful amateur tragedy production. FAY (217, 218) is concerned with original-language production of comedy, but does cover technical problems such as staging and rehearsal routines. SMITH's brief note (252) on one experience gives little help in understanding problems or reaching solutions. F. AUDIO-VISUALS: PRONUNCIATION OF CLASSICAL NAMES (216, 234, 249, 251) SCHMALZ (249) reports evaluations of 21 widely-varying films meant for background use in secondary-school classical study. She gives no information on whether or where the films are available. SEITTELMAN's lists (251 is the most recent) are the standard source on audiovisuals in classics; sellers' addresses are included. SEITTELMAN is more descriptive than critical. ELSE (216) and MILLER (234) provide pronunciation guides. VIII. EVALUATING TRANSLATIONS 259. Alexander, W.

Zuther, G., "Theories of Translation," C! 58 (1962) 19-22 See, generally, Arion, and TARRANT (194). Expectations of what a translation should do vary. ALEXANDER (259) argues vigorously for a translation that is "spiritually" faithful to the original and that has intrinsic interest to the age for which it was written. Such worthy goals would be better served than by the instance ALEXANDER himself provides, an adaptation of Catullus 9 in which the "in- tolerable business of men kissing each other" is suppressed. Should "adaptive translations" protect the reader so? ANGEL (260), using as criteria the translator's faithfulness to the word-meanings, symbols, and mood of the original, chooses Lewis' Aenieid over four others. CARNE-ROSS, with others, provides (261) a useful survey of Penguin translations. CHAMBERLIN (262) discusses his personal preferences (heroic couplets over English hexameters, etc.). ELSE (264) cites the need for a cooperative</page><page sequence="39">NOVEMBER 1975 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 199 effort to rate translations and define what should be done with them. GOLD- HURST's richly suggestive article (265) distinguishes the "mechanical" from the "lyrical" elements of a translation, comments on the translator's need to know "in what way to understand" the language of the original, and concludes: "A translator interested in Horace will accomplish not half so much as a translator interested in poetry." LIND (267) compares the current age with other great eras of translation (the Middle Ages, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), noting that "This is a great age of translation not because of its literary qualities," but because "the sense of continuity with the past in humanistic education" is liable to be "completely lost" if translations do not bring the classics to Greekless and Latinless readers. MARGON (172) views a translation as "a pane of glass," whose success depends upon how in- visible the medium can become in the presence of the original. He elaborates on his opposition to "structural translation" as represented by Logue. ZUTHER (269) surveys several writers (Alexander Tyler, Dryden, Schleiermacher, Pope) who con- sidered the degree of latitude that a translator should allow himself. DEWITT (263) commends the publication of small, single-work volumes rather than anthologies of IT material; the former, he observes, give the teacher more freedom in choosing materials. LEFKOWITZ (266) studies examples from Pindar and Bacchylides of Greek lyric vocabulary susceptible to "conventionalizing" distortion in modern translations, a tauWlt she sees as common. Her bibliographical notes and her perspective will both be Lseful in developing a greater awareness of pitfalls inherent in translating. ADDENDUM A new periodical. Helios (Journal of the Classical Association of the Southwest United States), deals with "new ways in which Classical Studies can be presented to students." Articles from N.S. Vol. 2 (1975): Barthelniess, J. A., "Classics in Translation: Narrowing the Gap" (23-30). The author describes in useful detail his strategies for keeping students aware that the Greek or Latin original always holds possibilities and nuances no translation can convey. Chief among these strategies are his use of drama-study groups and of brief lessons in Latin and Greek within the LIT course. Fredericks. S. C., "Science Fiction and the World of Greek Myth" (1-22). A survey of some light and serious uses of Greek myth in modern science fiction. with a 23-item bibliography. The field is untapped, and Fredericks demonstrates that it is a promising resource in aiding students to think creatively about ancient myth. Texas Tech University Edward V. George</page></plain_text>
