HEWITT AND RANDALL STOKES University of Massachusetts, Amherst American Sociological Review 1975, Vol. 40 (February): 1-1 1 This paper introduces, defines, and discusses a new concept, the disclaimer. The disclaimer is an interactional tactic employed by actors faced with upcoming events or acts which threaten to disrupt emergent meanings or discredit cathected situational identities. Its function is to predefine such problematic events for others in a manner which reduces their salience as interactional cues. Like "accounts" and "quasi-theories," the disclaimer belongs to a class of events, here called "aligning actions," which routinely serve to preserve situational definitions in the face of disruptive lines of conduct. At a broader level, it is suggested that cultural continuity rests in large part upon such aligning actions. INTRODUCTION roblematic events of varying seriousness occur in the concrete situations of everyday life: people are embarrassed by their own and others' faux pas; serious and trivial departures from role obligations are noticed; rules are broken (or, more properly, certain actions are treated as rule violations); extraordinary, disturbing, or seemingly inex- plicable behavior is observed in self or others. Such problematic events are important for two reasons. First, they affect the course and outcome of social interaction. People gear their words and deeds to the restoration and maintenance of situated and cherished identi- ties. When the violation of rules fractures the context of interaction, or when the emergent meaning of a situation is disrupted, people endeavor to repair the breaks and restore meaning. Thus, if the direction of social interaction in a given situation is to be well understood, adequate concepts for handling such events are necessary. Second, a conceptual grasp of the problematic features of identity, social inter- action and emergent meaning is crucial to an understanding of the classic problem of social order and cultural continuity. While the sociological treatment of the problem is conventionally anchored in socialization and the internalization of culture, there are several difficulties with such a formulation, most notably that little routine action appears guided by deeply internalized norms. A discussion of problematic events aids in the reformulation of the link between culture and behavior, for it is in relation to such problematic occasions that culture most clearly enters the consciousness of actors, shapes the meaning of their conduct, becomes fundamental to their identities, and is thus made visible and re-affirmed. Several concepts have been developed to deal with the problem of how actors restore disrupted meaning, repair fractured social interaction, and re-negotiate damaged identi- ties. C. Wright Mills' (1940) conception of "vocabularies of motive"; Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman's (1968) "accounts"; and John Hewitt and Peter Hall's (1970, 1973) *We are indebted to Rob Faulkner for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW "quasi-theories" each comes to grips with an important aspect of the dual problem of social interaction and culture in problematic situa- tions. For Mills, the most important feature of motives is that they arise in talk, whether as states of mind the person imputes to others or avows for himself. "As a word, a motive tends to be one which is to the actor and to the other members of a situation an unquestioned answer to questions concerning social and lingual conduct" (Mills, 1940:906). Motive talk is thus important to the ongoing construction of meaning in social interaction, since the continuity of both is sustained (in part) by people's ability to attribute their own and others' acts to "reasons" or "motives." While Mills addresses himself to the issue of how disrupted meaning is restored, his discussion lacks generality, since motive talk, while central to social interaction, is not the only means of dealing with disrupted meaning. The concepts of accounts and quasi- theories are also addressed, each in a particular way, to problematic meaning. Accounts are the justifications and excuses people offer when the course of interaction has been disrupted by an act or word. Quasi-theories are explanations people con- struct in social interaction to account for various kinds of problematic situations. Both concepts point to observable features of social interaction in which meaning is restored by efforts undertaken for that purpose. But these concepts are limited because their view of meaning and its reconstruction is largely retrospective-they deal with the definition of the past in the present. Neither deals adequately, nor is it intended to do so, with the anticipation of events, with the prospec- tive construction of meaning for words and deeds that may be problematic. This paper introduces, defines and dis- cusses a new concept, the "disclaimer." Its level is that of the account and the quasi-theory: a process that occurs in social interaction in which problematic events that may disrupt emergent meaning are defined and dealt with. Unlike accounts and quasi- theories, which are retrospective in their effect, disclaimers are prospective, defining the future in the present, creating interpreta- tions of potentially problematic events in- tended to make them unproblematic when they occur. The Disclaimer In order to define the disclaimer and describe its forms we must first attend to some major features of problematic meaning. As individuals in social interaction form their conduct in response to one another, meaning in their situation is created and maintained. The individual organizes meaning themati- cally: as behavior in the situation emerges he seeks to "fit" events to "theme" (McHugh, 1968). The relationship between the theme that organizes meaning and the specific acts or events that fit the theme is a reflexive one: events take on meaning when pattern is imputed to them; pattern is visible only in the concrete events it is used to interpret. When events or acts no longer seem understandable in terms of the patterns imputed to them, individuals examine discrepant events with some care, seeking to determine what has gone wrong with their understanding of the situation. Central to the themes used to organize meaning are identities. Whether defined on the basis of conventional, named social roles (father, policeman, teacher) or interpersonal roles established by specific individuals over time in relation to one another (friend, follower, enemy), situated identities are established and known to interactants. In- deed, the thematic organization of meaning by interactants usually depends upon their ability to interpret each others' actions as manifestations of particular identities. It follows that when events fail to fit themes in interaction, identities may come into focus as problematic: if the acts of another fail to appear sensible in light of his identity in the situation, perhaps he is not who he appears to be. The crucial place of identities in the organization of meaning points more generally to the importance of the process of typifying and the fact of typification in social interaction (Schutz, 1964). In their relations with one another, people search for and make use of specific cues from others as a means of typifying them, i.e., of treating them as kinds of persons. Socialized individuals carry with them a vast store of information as to how</page><page sequence="3">DISCLAIMERS 3 various types of persons will behave, what they are like, their typical motives and values, how to deal with them, etc. In concrete situations they search for cues from others, invoke a typification that appears relevant to those cues and rely upon the store of information organized by the typification in their subsequent interaction with the other, filling in the "gaps" in the other's self-pre- sentation with the typification. Some typifica- tions are essentially identical in content to conventional and interpersonal roles (thus we carry typifications of fathers, enemies, police- men), while others cut across the grain of roles, pointing to other "types" that may, in given cases, be important, even controlling in social interaction (so, for example, we carry typifications of the prejudiced, stupid, incom- petent, mentally ill, etc.). Crucial to the concept of the disclaimer is the fact that individuals know their own acts serve as the basis for typifying them; they know that specific acts they undertake will be treated by others as cues for typification. They know this, in the simplest sense, because they do it themselves, seeking in others' acts the "keys" that will unlock the secrets of their behavior. Moreover, with varying degrees of awareness, individuals seek to present others with cues that will lead to desired typifications of them - to present themselves in ways that will lead others to grant their situated identity claims. This awareness of typification (in general, if not in specific cases) plays an important role in the imaginative reconstructions of conduct that go on continuously in the mental life of the individual. As individuals construct their acts in imagination, they anticipate the responses of others, including the typificatory uses to which their acts will be put. For the individual, any given act is potentially a basis on which others can typify him. Put another way, as the individual anticipates the response to his conduct, he may see it either as in line with an established identity or as somehow discrepant, in which case it may be taken as a cue for some new typification, possibly a negative one, possibly a more favorable one. Individuals' anticipation of others' typifi- cations of them are not governed, however, by any simple principle of seeking positive and avoiding negative typifications. Life is filled with occasions on which individuals find it necessary to engage in acts that undermine the emergent meaning of situations and make probable the destruction of their identities in them. Even if they do not feel constrained to act in such ways, individuals may perceive opportunities - even legitimate ones - in lines of action they know others will take exception to. And on some occasions, individuals may sense the possibility of being typified in ways they would like to avoid, but find themselves without any certain way of anticipating the response. Under such circum- stances as these and others, disclaimers are invoked. A disclaimer is a verbal device employed to ward off and defeat in advance doubts and negative typifications which may result from intended conduct. Disclaimers seek to define forthcoming conduct as not relevant to the kind of identity-challenge or re-typification for which it might ordinarily serve as the basis. Examples abound and serve to make the abstract concrete: "I know this sounds stupid, but. . ."; "I'm not prejudiced, because some of my best friends are Jews, but. . ."; "This is just off the top of my head, so... ."; "What I'm going to do may seem strange, so bear with me." "This may make you unhappy, but.. ."; "I real- ize I'm being anthropomorphic...." In each of the foregoing examples, individuals display in their speech the expectation of possible responses of others to their impending conduct. In each example, a specific utterance calls the other's attention to a possible undesired typification and asks forbearance. Each phrase, in effect, disclaims that the word or deed to follow should be used as a basis for identity challenge and re-typification. The user's clear hope is that his intended act will not disrupt the current relationship, nor undesirably shift the emer- gent definition of the situation. Each disclaimer is thus a device used to sustain interaction, to manage the flow of meaning in situations, to negotiate a social order in which people can treat one another's acts with discretion, with good judgment, and with deserved good will. -Types of Disclaimers The examples cited above, as well as others, can best be analyzed by sorting</page><page sequence="4">4 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW disclaimers into several types, each of which reflects a different set of conditions of use. Hedging. There are countless situations in which individuals preface statements of fact or opinion, positions in arguments or expressions of belief with disclaimers of the following kind: "I'm no expert, of course, but. . ."; "I could be wrong on my facts, but I think. . ."; "I really haven't thought this through very well, but. . ."; "I'm not sure this is going to work, but let's give it a try"; "Let me play devil's advocate here...." What does the use of disclaimers of this type indicate about the individual's conduct and his expectations about others' responses? First, each expression is an intentional signal of minimal commitment to the impending line of conduct, an indication of willingness to receive discrepant information, change opin- ions, be persuaded otherwise or be better informed. Put otherwise, such an expression indicates the tentative nature of forthcoming action. Second, the tentative or negotiable coloration given subsequent conduct indicates a measure of uncertainty about the likely response to the act. From the standpoint of the individual constructing his act, what he is about to say may be taken seriously and importantly by others, thus confirming his identity; or it may be taken by others as damaging to his identity, even as the basis for some new, controlling typification of him. He does not know. Third, the re-typification that may occur is at least potentially serious. While the individual may suspect that the worst that can happen is that he will be thought ill-informed or wrong-headed, he faces the possibility that his act may fundamentally transform him in the eyes of the other. Minimal commitment and uncertain re- sponse are the defining conditions under which hedging takes place. Where an individ- ual does not know how his act will be received and simultaneously does not think a positive response to his act is essential to his identity or his ends, he will hedge by disclaiming in advance the importance of the act to his identity. "I'm no expert" is a phrase that conveys to others the idea that no expert identity is being claimed; if no expertise is, in fact, shown, no claim needs to be defended. The phrase signals to hearers that they should treat factually faulty statements or deeds that have the wrong effects as the normal prerogative of people who are not and do not claim to be expert in what they are doing. At the same time, variability in feared seriousness of response makes for variability within the category of hedging. At one extreme, a person may fear his words or deeds will drastically re-cast him in the eyes of others, and thus make attainment of his ends difficult. Persons who are expert, therefore, will often appeal to faulty memory, possible misunderstanding or over-specialization if they fear an impending act will lead to their re-typification as incompetent. Persons who occupy central, leadership positions in admin- istrative organizations often adopt the prac- tice of playing devil's advocate of positions they genuinely support, since they fear open and committed advocacy of position might erode their power and authority. At the other extreme, where people feel they have little to fear in the way of drastic re-typification, hedging is more like insurance, and often more like ritual; a way of reminding people that no great emphasis should be put on their success or failure, accuracy or error, in what they are about to say or do. Credentialing. Expressions of a different sort are employed when the individual knows the outcome of his act will be discrediting, but is nevertheless strongly committed to the act. Credentialing encompasses a group of expressions of this kind exemplified by the following: "I know what I'm going to say seems anthropomorphic, but. . ."; "I'm not prejudiced - some of my best friends are Jews, but. . ."; "Don't get me wrong, I like you work, but...." In credentialing individuals seek to avoid an undesired typification they are certain will follow from an intended act. The expressions of credentialing try to accomplish this by establishing for the actor special qualifications or credentials that, he implies, permit him to engage in the act without having it treated in the usual way as a cue for typification. In the classic "some of my best friends" example, the speaker acknowledges that someone who says what he is about to say might be typified as a prejudiced person, but implies his friendships put him in a protected category of people who cannot be so typified. The man who sees human qualities in his dogs knows that speaking of them in an anthropomorphic way will make him seem foolish, and so seeks</page><page sequence="5">DISCLAIMERS 5 to avoid the typification by announcing he knows it could be made. In this second example, knowledge of the negative aspects of an act is central to the establishment of a right to engage in the act anyway. Knowledge is a credential because it establishes the actor as one who may have purpose in what he is doing, so that others cannot easily regard him as an unknowing representative of a particular negative type. One who has purpose may have good purpose, whereas one who acts in blind ignorance of the implications of his act is presumed not to. Sin licenses. Another category of expres- sions is employed when the actor is committed to a line of conduct and is certain of a negative response, but does not fear some specific undesired typification. In some instances of social interaction, actors antici- pate that their acts will be treated as rule violations. Instead of a specific typification (e.g., racist, fool), the actor fears destruction of his identity as a "responsible member" of the encounter and the substitution of a "rule breaker" or "irresponsible member" typifica- tion of him. The focus of his talk and his concern is upon the rule which he fears will be invoked as a rebuke to his action. Hence the following examples: "I realize you might think this is the wrong thing to do, but .."; 'I know this is against the rules, but. . "Wat I'm going to do is contrary to the letter of the law but not its spirit...." Invoking the sin licensing disclaimer is equivalent to stipulating in advance that an act to follow might ordinarily be deemed a violation of a rule, and thus disruptive of the interaction that is taking place. The disclaimer is an effort to invoke in a specific situation the more general and commonly recognized principle that there are occasions on which rules may legitimately be violated without questioning the status of those who violate them. Just as accounts are invoked retrospec- tively as a way of placing rule violations in such a category, sin licensing DJisclaimers are invoked prospectively as a way of defining the conduct in advance. (But clearly there is less flexibility in the disclaimer - some excuses are good retrospectively but not prospective- ly.) In many instances the sin licensing disclaimer is invoked seriously; that is, its user genuinely fears typification as a rule breaker. In other cases, however, where rules are routinely broken and participants aware of this fact, licenses to sin are requested and granted on a pro forma basis. In either case, the license to sin pays due respect to the rules even while establishing the conditions 'under which they may be broken. Cognitive disclaimers. In routine social interaction, participants seldom have occasion to question one another's empirical grasp of the situation in which they are present. Participants generally assume substantive congruency between their own and others' grasp of the situation. Yet underlying any situation-Is the possibility that -the words or deeds of one participant will be construed by others as lacking sense, as out of touch with empirical reality, as somehow indicating the individual's failure to perceive the situation adequately and correctly. While individuals generally assume that others will assume their acts make empirical sense, they know that some acts may be misconstrued, and that this misconstrual may lead to their own re-typifica- tion as lacking sense, as out of touch, as disengaged when they should be engaged, as irrational. Under conditions where they think their acts may be so questioned, individuals use cognitive disclaimers such as the follow- ing: "This may seem strange to you. . "Don't react right away to what I'm going to do." "I know this sounds crazy, but I think I saw...." Cognitive disclaimers anticipate doubts that may be expressed concerning the speaker's capacity to recognize adequately the empirical facts of the situation in which he finds himself. By anticipating doubt, the disclaimer seeks to reassure others that there is no loss of cognitive capacity, that there is still agreement on the facts of the situation. In this form of disclaiming, as in the others, knowledge is a key element: by demonstrating in advance knowledge of a possible basis for re-typification, the individual establishes pur- pose for acts that might otherwise be taken as having no purpose, as reflecting a loss of cognitive control. Appeals for the suspension of judgment. If much social interaction is pursued in situa- tions in which people have common ends and work to achieve consensus on them and the means of attaining them, still in such interaction individuals recognize that on</page><page sequence="6">6 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW occasion their acts may offend even their friends. That is, people are aware that what they say and do may be offensive, angering or dismaying to those with whom they interact, unless and until they can place the act in a proper context, give it the "correct" meaning so far as the exchange is concerned. Under such circumstances, individuals appeal to their fellows to suspend judgment until the full meaning of the act can be made known. "I don't want to make you angry by saying this, but.. ."; "Don't get me wrong, but. . ."; "Hear me out before you explode." are illustrative of appeals individuals make for the suspension of judgment. Frequently such appeals take the form of appeals for the suspension of affect, in effect asking the other to hold back on what the actor fears will be a powerful affective response until full meaning can be trans- mitted. In other cases (e.g., "Don't react until I get this all out") the appeal is not to suspend specific affect, but merely to await full meaning. In either case, the disclaiming individual realizes that what he is about to do may disrupt the social situation, partly because the assumption of common purpose may be questioned, partly because it may promote his own re-typification as an "en- emy" or "turncoat" and not a comrade, friend or colleague. Responses to Disclaimers The discussion has so far emphasized users' perspectives, grounding its classification in the intentions and expectations of those who disclaim. But the picture is incomplete until we grasp how it is that others respond to disclaimers and how their responses affect the course of social interaction. From the user's standpoint, the disclaimer is an effort to dissociate his identity from the specific content of his words or deeds. Take, for example, the following use of credential- ing: "I'm no racist, because I have a lot of black friends and associates, but I think black people want too much, too soon." In this and similar instances, two fundamental claims are made: first, there is an identity claim-speci- fically, a negative typification as a racist is disclaimed, and so the opposite, valued identity is claimed; second, there is a substantive claim-specifically, an expressed belief that blacks want improvements more quickly than they can or should be provided. People use disclaimers in order to secure the success of substantive claims, but without the possible negative implications for their iden- tity claims. By the phrase substantive claim we refer to the fact that every word or deed has implications for the emerging definition of a situation and the joint action it contains. In the above illustration the substantive claim is a factual claim, that is, a statement that certain conditions are true of blacks. In other instances, substantive claims have to do with morality (e.g., "It is right to do what I am urging we do."), technical efficiency (e.g., "This is an appropriate way of doing things.") and the like. Every word or deed operates, in effect, as a claim that the situation should be defined in a certain way, or that it can be best defined in that way or that for all practical purposes that is the way to define it. While claims are not always (nor, perhaps, often) expressed in so many words, they operate to the same effect. This distinction is crucial to our discussion of responses, for both uses of and responses to disclaimers proceed on these parallel levels of identity and substance. On one hand, others may either accept or reject the identity portion of the disclaimer, either attributing to the user the identity he seeks to avoid or supporting his existing identity in the situation. On the other hand (and somewhat independently of their response on the issue of identity), others may accept or reject the user's substantive claims, agreeing or disagree- ing with his statements, regarding his actions as useful or dangerous, morally acceptable or prohibited. From the user's point of view, a disclaimer is fully successful if it allows both types of claim to be accepted; the other concedes the substantive import of the user's actions or expressions and makes no undesired re-typifi- cation of him. In the example cited above, factual claims about blacks would be granted and no re-typification as a racist would take place. Under such a condition of "full success," we may assume, interaction pro- ceeds on its course-a potential disturbance has been successfully skirted. Less desirable, but still to be counted a partial success, is the condition where a</page><page sequence="7">DISCLAIMERS 7 substantive claim is rejected, but where a possible re-typification is not made. Following the same example, a result such as the following illustrates partial success: "I think you're wrong about the pace of black progress but, of course, I know you are not a racist." In this condition, while the user has failed to define the situation in the hoped-for manner, he has at least succeeded in preserving his identity in the situation and avoiding re-typification. In either of the above conditions, we can speak of the acceptance of a disclaimer in the sense that the user's identity is preserved intact. A disclaimer is said to be rejected when its user is typified by another in a negative way, whatever his response to the substantive claim. On one hand, it seems likely that most rejected disclaimers involve a rejection of both claims: the use of credentialing, as in the above example, would lead both to a denial of the factual claim being made and to the re-typification of the user as a racist. On the other hand, there is at least the logical possibility that a substantive claim will be granted, but that simultaneously the user will be re-typified. "Being right for the wrong reasons" is an illustration of a condition where factual claims are granted in the very process of altering a user's identity. The acceptance or rejection of disclaimers is, however, a more complex and uncertain process than our eliptical discussion indicates. We have glossed over, thus far, the process of inference and signaling that is crucial to the outcome of a given disclaimer. The appropri- ate questions are the following: How is it that users infer acceptance or rejection of their claims? How is it that others signal acceptance or rejection of users' claims? The questions of inference and signaling are, in the course of real social interaction, bound closely together; indeed, there is much reflexivity between the two. Whether a signal is, in fact, a signal is not concretely a matter of fact, but depends upon the interplay between the user's inference and the other's intent. What is intended to be a signal may be falsely construed or not construed at all, and what is not intended as a signal may be so construed, either favorably or unfavorably to the user's hopes. And part of the making of an inference involves its being made known to the other that an inference has been made, a linkage that is always subject to possible slippage. For analytical purposes, however, we must separate inference and signaling. The former can be discussed by paying attention to the rules or procedures invoked by the user, whether inwardly or overtly, in an effort to determine the success of his disclaimer. In the most elementary sense prima facie evidence of a disclaimer's success is to be sought in the other's overt response: if the response the user hoped to avoid is not forthcoming, he has evidence that his tactic has succeeded. If an interactant credentials his prejudicial statement, he may infer the success of his credentlaling if no charge of prejudice is forthcoming. This will be so at the level of his identity claim, whatever the response given the substance of his action. The possibility always exists, of course, that others will withhold cues that would enable the interactant to judge the success of his disclaimer. While much of our imagery of role playing and role taking suggests that actors are always forthcoming about their true judgments, there is no reason to assume that awareness contexts are typically open. Closed, pretense or suspicion awareness contexts may characterize the use and response to disclaim- ers as much as any other form of interaction. Thus, we must observe, inferences about success based on prima facie evidence must always be, for the actors who make them, somewhat tentative. Every use of a disclaimer risks the possibility that a user's identity may be damaged without his immediately discover- ing the damage. More positively, users may infer acceptance or rejection from cues provided by others. Such cues, insofar as they are meant to signal acceptance, may take a variety of forms. The other may, for example, address himself explicitly to the issue raised by the disclaimer: "I realize you are no expert."; "I know you aren't prejudiced."; "I understand what you mean." These examples suggest responses that more or less explicitly signal the legitimacy of the disclaimer in the situation at hand. Sometimes the positive response may include the sharing of the disclaimer, which entails the other using an expression that indicates that he, also, shares the point of view of the user, that he too might, in similar circumstances, use the same disclaimer. We may assume that</page><page sequence="8">8 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW when others provide users with positive cues, inferences are made with more confidence and interaction continues on its course. Even here, however, there is slippage between intent and inference, and a nod of the head that signifies to the user the acceptance of his viewpoint may be to the other a means of giving the user more rope with which to hang himself. The question of inference and signaling also turns on the degree to which those who use disclaimers provide an opportunity for response. Social interaction is not always conducted with full attention to the etiquette of turn-taking; indeed, users of disclaimers may intentionally "rush" their interaction sequences in such a way that others are "left behind" and, having had no opportunity to object, are in the position of having agreed by default. An interaction sequence may be rushed by a refusal to yield the floor to another for a response or a refusal to "see" that the floor is wanted by another. A sequence may also be rushed where deeds follow so quickly upon words that commit- ments are made that cannot subsequently be escaped. Opportunities for negative responses to disclaimers may also be limited if users are able to "finesse" interaction sequences. On the one hand, actors can "get away with" words and deeds that are gross threats to their identities if they undertake them in small steps, invoking seemingly minor disclaimers along the way. That is, small disclaimers are honored more readily, we may suggest, than large ones, but a series of small disclaimers may result in a major behavioral cue being treated as irrelevant to the actor's identity. On the other hand, it is not unreasonable to suppose that actors may on occasion make a disclaimer of far greater magnitude than their impending act calls for, knowing the other may thus be more likely to accept it. On any occasion where a disclaimer might be used, the user has some discretion in terms of associating his impending act with a possible negative typification of him. By exaggerating the possibly negative typification, and then proceeding with his word or deed, he hopes to secure acceptance by virtue of contrast. The net outcome of successful disclaimers, whether the acceptance is voluntary or reflects the user's successful rushing or finessing of the interaction sequence, is that the user's identity in the situation is at least temporarily sustained. No re-typification in negative terms takes place, no disruption in the emergence of meaning occurs. Not only this, acceptance of a disclaimer, and particu- larly the acceptance of a series of disclaimers, commits both participants to the reciprocal identities being built up. As a situation proceeds and as disclaimers are employed successfully, we can hypothesize that it becomes more difficult for participants to reject subsequent disclaimers-the progressive solidification of identities lays the groundwork for easier disclaiming and, at some stage, makes it possible for actors to assume disclaimers and acceptances of one another rather than having to make each one explicitly. How, then, are disclaimers rejected? What cues are sought or provided? What procedures are used to make inferences about accep- tance? Again, in the simplest sense, prima facie evidence of rejection is to be found if the other explicitly avows what the disclaimer had sought to avoid. Rejection is certain if the other affirms that the very re-typification that the user feared is, in fact, to be made of him. "You should be an expert in this area!" "You've had plenty of time to work on a proposal." "If you know it's anthropomor- phic, why are you saying it?" Expressions such as these are used as counters to disclaimers, indicating to the user in direct terms that his tactic has not worked, that he will' be re-typified unless he can adduce evidence to show why he should not be. The failure of a disclaimer makes its user subject to re-typification in the very terms his disclaimer provided to the other. This fact is both a weakness and a strength. It is a weakness, of course, because the use of a given disclaimer provides other interactants with a ready-made issue in terms of which the now-disrupted meaning of the context can be managed. Where hedging has been used, the issue is the identity of the user: thus, for example, a disclaimer of devil's advocacy may be met with a denial that only devil's advocacy is meant, that, in fact, the user is concealing his true purpose or goals, i.e., his true identity. Where credentialing has been employed, the issue becomes one of purpose</page><page sequence="9">DISCLAIMERS 9 or intent, specifically of good or bad intent, since the use of credentialing rests largely upon the implication that since the user knows the possibly evil connotations of what he is about to do or say, he may have other than evil intent. Thus charges of evil purpose and identity concealment may also be made. Where sin licensing has been invoked, the issue turns on the applicability of a given rule to the act in question. Where cognitive disclaim- ers are used, the issue becomes one of fact and its interpretation. Where the appeal is to suspend judgment, the issue is whether, in the end, meaning was in fact clarified during the suspension. To say that "the issue" turns upon this or that point is to say that the focus of interaction itself turns upon the disclaimer, its user's identity and the associated act. Since the user has, via his disclaimer, announced the problematic quality of his words or deeds, he has placed ready-made weapons at the disposal of the other. The question that arises at this point, therefore, is how interaction progresses when it focuses upon the disclaim- er. It is worth noting that up to this point, the user has sought to manage his own identity in the eyes of the other, whatever the outcome with respect to substantive claims. Now the issue is, basically, his identity, and what is important to the user is how that identity may be sustained. While the tactics of identity maintenance in such circumstances is a matter of empirical discovery, it seems likely that altercasting will play an important role in the proceedings. Altercasting (Weinstein and Deutschberger, 1963) is a process in which actors endeavor to regulate the identities of others: going on the offensive in an argument, treating a particular child as the "baby of the family," creating a "straw man" and identifying an opponent with it are illustrations of the technique of altercasting. In each case, an other's identity is governed, or an effort is made to have it be governed, by an actor's actions. (Altercasting is to be understood in contrast with identity as a phenomenon an actor manages for himself.) The significance of altercasting in the disclaiming process lies in the fact that an identity established for another has implica- tions for the identity of the altercaster. Identities are reciprocal, which is to say that participants in social interaction establish identities for themselves and each other in a mutually related texture where the position of one has implications for the position of another. In the disclaiming process, altercast- ing would appear to be significant because it offers the user a "last chance" to salvage his own identity by trying to establish for the rejecting other an identity that will reflect favorably on the rejected user. Having failed to disclaim an identity implied in his actions and utterances, the user may attempt to salvage his identity by more or less forcibly working on the identity of the other, seeking to portray the other in a light that makes his own discredit less serious, or even makes it disappear. Thus, to illustrate, the user may act towards the other as if the latter, too, shared in the discredit: following our example of the credentialing racist, the user may seek to apply the label racist to the other, perhaps by citing or alleging more serious violations on the part of the latter. In addition to altercasting, the user may turn to various accounts (Scott and Lyman, 1968) as a way of extracting himself from his predicament. As a disclaimer is used and meets a negative response, it passes into the immediate past, and so becomes a proper object of an account. The user may excuse his conduct, thus defusing its relevance to his identity by accepting its undesirable nature by denying responsibility. Or he may attempt a justification, accepting responsibility but arguing for the irrelevance of his act to his identity. The possible outcomes of rejected disclaim- ers, in terms of the course of the interaction and the identities of participants, are many, and difficult to summarize or generalize. Underlying all outcomes, however, is the basic fact that issues of substance have become transformed into issues of participants' identities. In effect, when disclaimers are rejected, a situation is transformed, with possibly unpleasant short and long-term consequences for the actor whose identity claims have been destroyed. That a rejected disclaimer does not inevitably imply the loss of a desirable situated identity, and may in fact be a strength to the user, turns on the fact that a user may under some conditions seek to have</page><page sequence="10">10 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW his disclaimer rejected. If some actors are genuinely concerned with their identities in the eyes of others, others may be cynical in the use of disclaimers. Just as an individual may use a disclaimer that is far out of proportion to the "real" implications of his conduct in the hopes that it will be more easily accepted, he may look ahead, construct alternative scenarios of the conversation on which he is embarked and choose disclaimers in such a way that discussion turns on issues he can best argue. If his disclaimer is accepted, he is able to pursue the line of conduct he had in mind. If it is rejected, he is in a relatively strong position to argue his case, to portray his partner's characterization of him as a "straw man," even though he is himself the source of the characterization. CONCLUSION: THE DISCLAIMER AND SOCIAL THEORY The disclaimer and the broader current of thought of which it is a part have significance for a long-standing problem in social theory. This is the question of how culture enters individual action or, more broadly, how social order and continuity are maintained. Culture, in most formulations, is the root of continuity. Parsons, (1966:5-7) for example, visualizes culture as akin to the genetic code of physical organisms. Just as the genetic pool of a species provides the parameters for individual phenotypes, so does culture provide the persisting identity for individual actions and interaction. Yet, the crucial question of how culture enters individual action has not been satisfactorily answered. The most important link between culture and action is generally seen to be the socialization process. Following Mead's sem- inal account of the generalized other, and de-emphasizing his concern for emergence, heaviest stress has been placed on internaliza- tion as the means by which culture is transmitted and becomes influential upon action. From this perspective, internalization constitutes a functional equivalent to instinct in other animal species; the bee's dance is guided by a genetic template and man's by a deeply internalized normative structure. Al- though the origins of control are different, the consequences are the same. In both cases, the direction and substance of action are provided by a precognitive and involuntary hierarchy of preferences. In those (relatively rare) situa- tions where deviance does occur, the reason is seen to be incomplete or faulty socialization and the link of culture to behavior is then maintained by mechanisms of external control in the form of sanctions. The perspective sketched, or perhaps caricatured, above has been seriously ques- tioned in recent years. The fundamental root of such questioning is empirical. While it is clear that certain cultural elements are deeply internalized, particularly language-based logi- cal and inferential canons, primal esthetic preferences and so on, relatively little of routine social action appears to be guided by deeply internalized normative structures. Man does not act like a well-programmed social robot; indeed, in much of everyday social action, variation from normatively prescribed behavior is statistically "normal." This point has been made from a number of different theoretical perspectives. Dennis Wrong (1961) has argued from a psycho- analytical perspective that sociologists typi- cally err by viewing man as "over-socialized." Sociology, he claims, has historically failed to take account of residual and unsocialized libidinal energy, which continues to exert a dynamic and "unsocial" influence on individ- ual action. David Riesman (1950) and Allen Wheelis (1958), while they don't dispute that traditional views of the link between action and culture may have fitted some earlier time, contend that such models are increasingly inappropriate for contemporary society. Modern man, they argue, is given by his socialization a diffuse capacity to read social cues and to make situationally appropriate responses, rather than any deeply internalized normative set. A third important critique of internaliza- tion as the link between action and culture has emerged from the interactionist and neo-phenomenological traditions. In radical contrast to structural theorists who tend to view culture as given, interactionist and neo-phenomenological theorists are most concerned with the creative and problematic aspects of the relationship between action and culture. Erving Goffman's (1959) vision of the presentation of self as an often laborious and conscious "fitting" of one's line of conduct to cultural norms, Ralph Turner's (1962) substi-</page><page sequence="11">DISCLAIMERS 11 tution of "role-making" for "role-playing," and the ethnomethodological explications of the et cetera rule and similar subroutines (cf. Cicourel, 1970) all convey the same essential point: culture is largely exterior to the person and often problematic. The foregoing questions and reconceptuali- zations have made the issue of cultural, and thus social, continuity particularly pressing. If indeed there is minimal deep internalization of culture, at least in contemporary society, how do we account for social order? How is it, faced with the ambiguities and contradic- tions of a complex society, that normative continuity and meaning are sustained in the actions of diverse and individualistic actors? For a start, it would be well to view culture as learned, and only approximately so; instead of as internalized. Rather than being somehow akin to instinct, culture is. best seen as a kind of shifting cognitive map of the social order and largely within the awareness of the actor. From this point of view, culture is environ- mental to action. It constitutes one of several sets of parameters within which action is framed. Although there is considerable open- ness to action, culture, meaning here situa- tionally appropriate norms, meanings and judgmental standards, must be taken into account as the actor constructs his line of conduct. The disclaimer, along with accounts and vocabularies of motives, are among the means by which actors "take account" of culture. In the interests of preserving cath- ected identies, of making situations sensible, and of facilitating interaction, actors explicit- ly define the relation between their question- able conduct and prevailing norms. Collective- ly these might be called "aligning actions" in the sense that they are intended to serve as means of bringing problematic conduct into line with cultural constraints. The net consequence of aligning actions is to perpetu- ate normative order and meaning in the face of lines of conduct which are objectively at variance with situational norms and under- standings.
