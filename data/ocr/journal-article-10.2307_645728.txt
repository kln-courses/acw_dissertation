In part 2, Willis attributes male-female commen- sality among the Fipa of Tanzania to transforma- tions in relations of production in the late precolon- ial period and shows why the arts of rhetoric and persuasion integrate political and domestic affairs. Engard examines the role of dance in constituting chiefship among the Bafut of Cameroon, viewing it as a strategy for converting material wealth into symbolic capital. Middleton locates the rituals used by the Lugbara of Uganda to resolve conflict along a continuum of divine power; in doing so, he de- scribes the social and symbolic burdens of using power to replace ambiguity with order. Southall deals with the interplay between the social and ma- terial worlds of western Nilotic peoples; he shows how identity, power, and sanctity are sources of au- thority and means of social reproduction. Part 3 begins with Bauer's description of the so- cial implications of competing explanations of mis- fortune among the Tigray of Ethiopia; he shows how priests and diviners draw on similar sources of knowledge, but use their powers for different pur- poses. Gottlieb's intriguing material on the Beng of Ivory Coast deals with the linkages among kingship, kinship, and witchcraft; she argues persuasively that kings, like witches, acquire their power by will- fully sacrificing an aspect of their own socio-sym- bolic identity, but that in contrast to the insatiable greed of a witch, a king's killing of his matrikin is controlled and selective, thereby legitimizing his rule. Ebin explores the redistribution of power in a Ghanaian Akan community faced with crisis; she shows how, in a society that stresses the centrali- zation of religious and political authority, a men's secret society becomes incorporated into its arsenal against witches. Fairley also examines competing power centers; she describes the ways in which the Ben'Ekie bukishi secret society coexisted with and preserved the kingship in precolonial Zaire. Viewed collectively, these fine-grained analyses of the imagery, uses, and ramifications of power in sub-Saharan African societies present a unified ap- proach to a concept that occupies a pivotal but troublesome place in social science discourse. They do not, however, point to a unified definition of power, except on a very broad level: power as transformative capacity used by people to act in and on their worlds. While all the essays confront Western with non-Western notions of power, albeit often indirectly, they imply that reconciling dispar- ate cultural conceptions is less fruitful than explor- ing the nuances and contradictions of the social worlds these different conceptions animate. Foreheads of the Dead: An Anthropological View of Kalabari Ancestral Screens. NIGEL BARLEY. Washington, DC, and London: Smithsonian Institution Press for the National Museum of African Art, 1988. 88 pp., photo- graphs, notes, bibliography. $15.95 (paper). PHILIP M. PEEK Drew University Themes and arguments of broad application are often best developed in the tightly focused study of a single cultural complex. This is certainly true of Nigel Barley's concise monograph which accom- panied a recent exhibition at the National Museum of African Art, Washington, DC: "Kalabari Ances- tral Screens: Levels of Meaning." These unique ob- jects consist of palm rib screens (averaging three and one-half feet high by two and one-half feet wide) on which carved and decorated human fig- ures are attached; the larger central figure, usually wearing a masquerade headdress, depicts the ancestor being honored. Used by the Kalabari Ijo of the eastern Niger Delta to venerate the founders of their trading houses, these specific pieces were originally given to a British colonial government of- ficial, P. A. Talbot, between 1914 and 1916 to pro- tect the screens from local fundamentalist Chris- tians. Talbot donated them to the British Museum and other museums in England where they have been stored ever since. The catalog includes an extensive essay on the ancestral screens, placing them in historical, cul- tural, and aesthetic contexts, and a catalogue rai- sonne with full-page illustrations of the exhibited objects. Valuable field and archival photographs accompany the text. This work can be approached from several directions, but because its value to scholars interested in the Niger Delta is most ob- vious, I will attempt to address the larger themes in the anthropology of art which Barley develops. Re- lying on his own brief field experience in this area as well as earlier anthropological research and trav- elers' accounts, Barley uses the ancestral screens as means to reveal the economic and political history of the Kalabari Ijo trading houses, the relationship of these institutions to masquerade traditions, Kal- abari worldview and concepts of selfhood, Kalabari aesthetics, and the complex cultural interaction of European and Kalabari traders. From the late 15th century to the mid-i 9th cen- tury, Kalabari traders, organized in corporate canoe houses, were key middlemen for the trade (includ- ing slaves and palm oil) between inland southeast- ern Nigerian peoples and European traders. Both in the essay and notes for the individual screens we come to understand the complexities of the Kala- bari trading house system, for in many ways the screens serve to complement oral traditions about the founders of the houses and their accomplish- ments. The location of the screens as well as the in- dividuals depicted on them provide a record of eco- nomic and political development. In addition to ac- quiring status and power through the trading houses, Kalabari men used membership in the Ek- ine Society, a secret men's masquerade society which honors only the water spirits, to enhance their positions. The tensions between these two in- stitutions are reflected in the ancestral screens' "public" depiction of "secret" masquerades in that each screen carefully presents the masquerade headdress which the screen's honoree was permit- ted to wear. The Kalabari term for these objects, duein fubara (literally, "foreheads of the dead") identifies a key component of personhood. Each individual's teme, "fixed spirit" (which controls one's behavior in a complex relationship with other elements within 810 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">the individual), resides in the living person's fore- head; thus, each duein fubara serves to locate this power of the honored ancestor. The Kalabari world is one of continual interaction of the living, the ancestors, the heroes, and the water spirits with carved and constructed images providing critical points of contact among these realms. As well as providing an avenue to Kalabari worldview, the duein fubara permit comment on Kalabari aesthet- ics which find application primarily in public dis- plays of dancing and costume rather than in ob- jects, which are secreted in sacred shrine areas as are the screens. At several points in the work, Barley discusses cross-cultural aesthetics and the difficul- ties in approaching Kalabari art. While the impor- tance of visual appearance which Westerners usu- ally associate with aesthetics may not be totally ap- plicable to these pieces, they do illustrate the "art of assemblage" which reflects a larger theme in Kal- abari culture, a culture which easily assimilates "foreign" elements. Barley suggests that the form and content of the screens may have been influenced by European photography (in contrast to an older suggestion of origin in the extraordinary bronze plaques which decorated the king's palace of the powerful Benin empire to the northeast). Although the screens seem to predate the introduction of photography to the Niger Delta, the relationship of such aspects of Eu- ropean cultures and indigenous cultures encoun- tered by European travelers, missionaries, and trad- ers surely needs to be better understood. The Kala- bari do view the screens' central figures as portraits of specific ancestors despite their highly stylized form. Although a somewhat specialized volume, this work serves as an excellent case study of how an artistic tradition reflects its culture and thereby pro- vides an excellent example of the value, to both his- torian and ethnologist, of considering a full cultural complex diachronically in order to understand a people and a process of acculturation. While Bar- ley's specific conclusions may be debated, his dis- cussion of the multifaceted interaction of European and Kalabari cultures is highly informative. This volume certainly belongs in any library serving pro- grams in art and anthropology as well as African studies. As we learn more about individual African cultures, I hope there will be more such tightly fo- cused studies. Sayings of the Ancestors: The Spiritual Life of the Sibundoy Indians. JOHN HOLMES MCDOWELL. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1989. x + 206 pp., photographs, ap- pendix, references, index. $21.00 (cloth). RAQUEL ACKERMAN California State University, Los Angeles The Ingano people in the Sibundoy valley of southwestern Colombia are at the juncture of three major cultural traditions: native Amazonian sha- manism, Inca Quechua, and Spanish Catholicism. Contemporary migration to large South and Central American cities has added to the array of cultural influences. Despite the syncretic nature of their cul- ture, their everyday life is guided by a vast corpus of proverblike sayings attributed to the first Ingano. These sayings in the Inga language-a dialect re- lated to Imperial Cuzco Quechua-have remained unchanged through the centuries, we are told. They provide key insights into the Ingano culture. Their first function is that of omens. They are used to foretell the future by helping in the interpretation of dreams and signs. In their second function, John McDowell regards the sayings as linking the present with the "ever-present ancestral past." The sayings bring an atemporal wisdom into the particular cir- cumstances of individuals' lives. Their third func- tion is that of accessing the otherwise obscure and hard to reach spiritual world. The spiritual world has a direct effect on the health of people. It is con- stituted by anthropomorphic, animal, natural, and fantastic characters. Close adherence to the moral principles of the sayings assures "spiritual health." Spirits share the ancestors' temporal sphere. It is through their ability to connect individuals with their ancestors in the past that the sayings serve as a means of making contact with the more inacces- sible spiritual realm. If the ancestors give advice as to how to behave in the world and interpret its signs, it is the spiritual realm that is responsible for the health and destiny of the Ingano. The sayings are just one door to the spiritual realm. Other insights are provided by the Ingano mythic corpus and by visions obtained through a variety of Amazonian hallucinogenic drugs. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to the compi- lation of 203 sayings and several myths. The sayings are grouped into two general categories-those that refer to dreams and those that refer to signs. Each of these categories is further subdivided into sets that share some element mentioned in the sayings. Each saying is presented in the Ingano language with a textual English translation. Some have an additional commentary made by Ingano informants, and oth- ers have comments made by John McDowell. McDowell claims that the sayings have "a logic and a frame of reference all their own, external to the human dramas to which they are applied" (p. 154), while at the same time "the spiritual life of the Si- bundoy natives [is seen] as a rational and coherent system" (p. vii). Regretfully, neither the "logic" of the sayings nor the "coherence" of the system un- derlying Sibundoy spiritual life becomes apparent at any point in the book. Rather these "logics" re- main opaque to the reader, probably due to the book's organization and the arguments advanced by the author. Moreover, insufficient cross-refer- ences among the sayings and poor indexing at the end of the book compound the problems. The data in this book are abundant. It has, how- ever, two serious flaws. Most of the sayings are de- contextualized from their conversational setting. The data lack a systematic presentation, and one is often puzzled by the purpose of specific informa- tion. These two flaws detract greatly from the use- fulness of the data. Livelihood and Resistance: Peasants and the Politics of Land in Peru. GAVIN SMITH.
