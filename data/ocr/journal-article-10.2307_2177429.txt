Interest is the fundamental organizing factor in the life of action and of appreciation. Interests are at once the results and the representations of the organization of affective and conative tendencies. The generality of the factor of interest is conditioned by its lack of a common objective reference and its consequent limitation to the conformity of the acts and tendencies of a single person with the general type. This affective generalization is teleological in character, but it has not the determinateness or the fixity of cognitive gen- eralization. Corresponding to a similar distinction in the cognitive realm, we note in affective generalization a distinction between mere customary, 'syndoxical' conformity and real, 'synnomical' agreement or practical uni- versality. While conformity in the cognitive sphere is attained by means of the logical principles of limitation, exhaustion, etc., it is secured in the prac- tical sphere through the transference by ejection of 'blocks' of interest. This process of affective conversion is verified by the substantial realization of our expectations in regard to one another's actions. That this sort of conformity is 'syndoxical' rather than 'synnomical' is made manifest by its opposite, non-conformity in the practical life, which arises, not so much through ignorance or lack of conscientiousness, as through the inner organiza- tion of interest on the part of different individuals. We thus see that per- sonal coherence or conformity may, to a great extent, demand social non- conformity. As opposed to the distinctions, limitations, etc., of logical inference, affective assertion and negation are immediate, active, and ap- preciative reactions. The chief difference between cognitive and affective generalization rests upon community of interest or action. Since this com- munity is limited to the organization of the individual's interests and since he can only transfer his own feelings and interests to others by a process of interpretation, we have not yet discovered the 'synnomical' element which 455</page><page sequence="2">456 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. gives normative force to the general principles of individual conduct. This task remains over for a later article in the present series. J. R. TUTTLE. Schopenhauer's Type of Idealism. WILLIAM MACKINTIRE SALTER. Monist, XXI, I, pp. i-i8. Idealism says that objects do not exist outside our minds, that our own bodies exist only in our own minds or in the mind of someone else. To Schopenhauer this view seems simply a matter of clear thinking. Furthermore, no definite line, he says, can be drawn between life and dreams. The world of perception, to use a Hindu expression, is a "veil of Maja" (that is, illusion). But this language is literary and emotional, and must be taken with circumspection. Elsewhere Schopenhauer argues that, if the world were only a dream, it would not be worthy of our serious attention. His conception of the world as ultimately will implies that objects are not merely complexes of sensation, but have an inner being of a quite different character. And he also says that a perceived object must have some manner of existence in itself, else we should have ab- solute idealism ending in solipsism, and the theoretic egoist is a fit subject for a madhouse. The empirical character and the unfathomability of the world are evidence that it is more than phenomenon. Ueberweg, Volkelt, and others assert that Schopenhauer contradicts himself. "No object without a sub- ject," he first affirms; and then, "There are things independent of a subject." The apparent inconsistency, however, is due to a double use of the term "ob- ject. " When he says, " No object without a subject," he means no object that is distinct. In this sense he chides Kant for speaking of things-in-themselves as "objects." The desk, the stars, as groups of sensible qualities would not exist if not perceived. But something lying back of these qualities may exist independently of the perceiving subject. Our world of phenomena may be a dream and have no self-existence, but it is a dream that means something, and that is not a dream. An idealist then as to the world of our knowledge; but a realist in the sense of holding to a sphere of existence beyond the bounds of positive knowledge-that is what Schopenhauer seems to be. J. REESE LIN. The Idea of Feeling in Rousseau's Religious Philosophy. A. C. ARMSTRONG. Ar. f. G. Ph., XXIV, 2, pp. 242-260. Sentimental deism is the established form of Rousseau's religious philosophy. His is the religion of the inner light, founded on the sentiment interieur. The advent of the new religion of feeling was announced by the religious experience of Julie in the Nouvelle Heloise; the fourth part of Emile gave sentimental deism its classical expression; and the eighth chapter of the fourth book added the principle of the religion civile. Inward conviction is worthy of authority because the self is a judging, active being. Diverging from the free-thinkers, Rousseau denied the Helvetian identification of judgment and sensation, and</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 457 refused that doctrine as materialistic. The competence of philosophy to decide ultimate questions is denied because its answers conflict. Yet Rousseau mixes much philosophy with the appeal to sentiment. Man forms a unity in his religious functioning as well as in his non-religious life. Theories of the world and the demands of the heart inevitably interact. Nevertheless the final decision is not made by the intellect. The ultimate test is always the inward experience. The primary characteristic of the inner feeling is its subjectivity. This is both individual and inward. In matters of faith the individual atti- tude is always inculcated, except in the doctrine of the religion civile where Rousseau fixes a minimum of belief as necessary for the preservation of the state. Ideas come from without; sentiments, the final arbiters of belief, spring up within the soul. The disjunction between these is not complete, yet sen- timents have the title to authority because they primarily refer to self. More- over, they give subjective certainty, to which Rousseau attaches much impor- tance. The operations of the discursive reason are prolonged and their issue doubtful, while the revelations of the inner light are direct and their issue clear. The inner light, however, applied in specific ways, contains definite cognitive elements, inner sentiment being equivalent to self-conscious awareness of the facts of mental life. Expositors of Rousseau often overlook the fact that as his deism advanced to its final stage, the inner sentiment became an appreci- ation of values. In contrast to many other writers Rousseau applies the cri- terion of worth directly to religious questions. Much more than Kant and the post-Kantians he makes the religious factor substantive and of inherent in- terest. Faith is the groundwork of morals; religion supports conduct. But there are motives to religious practice other than the purely moral motive, and it is possible for moral theology to sacrifice elements which religion cannot properly leave out. J. REESE LIN. D4personnalisation et emotion. L. DuGAs et F. MOUTIER. Rev. Ph., XXXV, II, Pp. 44I-460. Depersonalization is an intellectual trouble, frequently the reaction from a strong emotion, which passes over into a moral debility. From observation of many cases, Janet concluded that strong emotion often has a dissolving effect on the mind, lessening the power of synthesis, inhibiting attention and will, and causing a feeling of unreality. The most acute form of depersonalization consists in being unable to experience emotion. Alexandrine, a typical sub- ject, lamented her lack of love for her husband and children, and finally marveled at her indifference to her own condition. Sometimes a violent emotion raises the level of consciousness, instead of lowering it, and so breaks up this indifference. Both the malady and the recovery have species and de- grees. The inability to participate in certain mental states may be because those states impose on the subject too great an effort of attention, of mental synthesis, and, on the contrary, because they do not arouse sufficient interest to hold the attention. The subject is often apathetic toward other things, but</page><page sequence="4">458 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. takes strong interest in her malady. The emotional paralysis is sometimes due to autosuggestion. A sudden emotion causes the patient to forget that she cannot feel, and she is cured. The loss of the emotional tone peculiar to a man causes him to feel depersonalized. The subject madly seeks the emotion which he no longer experiences, hoping that, if he can recover that particular one, he will recover with it the sense of reality which he has lost. We dis- tinguish the constitutional cases in which emotion is always below the normal level from the case in which a shock temporarily lowers the level. In the one, called impersonalization, the subject does not identify as his own the emotions he feels; in the other, which is depersonalization, only the warmth and color of the emotions is lost. Impersonalization brings no feeling of strangeness; depersonalization does. In the latter we find three elements: (I) the emotion which determines the crisis, (2) the absence of emotion which marks the state, and (3) the sense of strangeness which arises. The evidence shows that the emotions are on the same footing with the other psychic states. The subject attends without distinction to his emotions, his perceptions, and his memories, wondering why he experiences them. The malady is the rupture of the bond which attaches consciousness of self to the mental states of the subject. J. REESE LIN. The Psychological Explanation of the Development of the Perception of External Objects (II.). H. W. B. JOSEPH. Mind, No. 76, pp. 457-469. This article is a criticism of the second part of Professor Stout's account of the genesis of the perception of external objects, this part dealing with the external reality of objects. Statement of Professor Stout's position: The recognition of the external reality of object arises from (I) motor adaptations, (2) projection of the self. (I) The particular motor adaptations concerned are those voluntary activities by which we bring into the field of consciousness sense-presentations which as to their own character are independent of us. For instance, we can open or close our eyes and thereby see or refuse to see the house and trees about us, but having opened our eyes and directed them to a particular point we have no power over what shall be the substance of our visual perceptions. This contrast of what I can and cannot do in the case of motor adaptation supplies an experiential element to attribute to external reality. (2) But the idea of the something to which this element is attributed is gained through the projection of the self. The not-self is constructed on the analogy of the self in this wise: we see and at the same time feel as our own the movements of our body. So when we see other similar movements which we do not feel to be ours, we assign them to some other self. Criticism: (I) If we suppose, as is desired, a being who knows nothing but a succession of con- scious states, he would not arrive at a knowledge of externality through the sequence of not-self-initiated presentations upon self-initiated ones. The only inference conceivable on the part of such a being would be that some power like Berkeley's God forced upon us certain sensations while we ourselves brought about the others. (2) The discussion of the projection of the self</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 459 implies a knowledge of the relation of his mind and body on the part of the subject, which was, by hypothesis, excluded. The subject's body has been mysteriously transferred in the argument from a relation to the subject similar to that of other presented objects to a particularly intimate and well-under. stood relation to the self. If you start with separate sense-presentations and them alone, you must, like Hume, always keep to them and their combinations. The fundamental fallacy in such an explanation of the consciousness of exter- nality is that it takes for granted a primary human consciousness of sense- presentations as distinct from things presented. KATHERINE EVERETT. Hellenistic Philosophy. GILBERT MURRAY. Hibbert Journal, IX, I, pp. i5-36. The decadence of the traditional Greek religion might seem at first sight to have left a clear field for the propagation of a new and vigorous philosophy. But a hankering after the old superstitions remained and vitiated the new intellectual growth. Thus, when chance or fate supplanted the Olympian gods and goddesses as the ultimate source of human weal or woe, these too before long became persons and divinities. Men fell to worshipping and placating Fortuna. This is what happened to the religion of those who, when the Olympian system fell, rejected all belief in gods. But on the other hand, there was at this period a two-fold constructive attitude toward religion: first, a worship of the heavenly bodies, and second, a recognition of the divine ele- ment in man. From wonder at the orderly movements of sun, moon, and planets, the Greeks passed to an adoration of them as divinities. But this worship became anthropomorphic. Not the sun, but Mithra; not the planet Mercury, but the spirit Hermes, was god. Such a religion readily assimilated the allegory and mysticism of the astrology of Eastern religions; by its aid men were taught how to escape the malignant influence of the planets, through mystic union with a god who lives in a region beyond the sun. But in the other phase of their religious thought, these Greeks found God in the divine element in man. In some men this divine element seemed to loom large. The cruder minds hailed their conquerors, their kings, and prosperous men as gods who controlled the fortunes of men and were to be worshipped. But the more thoughtful people sought a god in a man who ministered to the higher nature, who initiated them into the mystic rites, or in some way helped them spiritually. The essential characteristic of this whole Hellenistic spirit was allegorical interpretation. The world, they were sure, must be other and bet- ter than it seemed. Thus, often by a sickly artificiality and by symbolism, did they build up in a decaying age an idealistic interpretation of the world. KATHERINE EVERETT. La matiere du devoir. ADRIEN NAVILLE. Rev. Ph., XXXII, pp. II3-I27. The excellence of S. S. Laurie's book, Ethics, or the Ethic of Reason, lies in his attempt to provide duly in a system of morality for both reason and feeling,</page><page sequence="6">460 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. for the truths of rationalism and of hedonism. But in spite of his liberal intention his system is too narrow. He admits as moral only the rational feelings, the feelings that indicate organization and harmony in the inner -being. A perfectly fair view of morality would not neglect the true value in the pleasures of sense and in egoistic pleasures of every sort; but, on the other hand, it would insist that there is an end distinct from pleasure,-truth. -There are two kinds of truth, the truth of scientific laws and facts, and the truth of value. Scientific truth, the satisfaction of pure intellectual curiosity, is an absolute end for the moral being, binding whether it bring pleasure or grief. The truth of value Is the organization of goods on rational principles. Feeling, through its experience of pleasure, informs us of the content of the good; reason, in the construction of a truth of value, shows us the relation between present and future, the individual and the social good. Morality is the practice of the truth of values. KATHERINE EVERETT. -Critique des methodes de l'esthetique. CHARLES LALo. Rev. Ph., XXXV, 12, pp. 600-624. Certain mystically-minded people deny the possibility of method in aesthet- ics. To them the beautiful is the ineffable, to be reached by intuition, not understood by intelligence. Pascal believed that in aesthetics all method was a sacrilege. This attitude is justifiable only in so far as it is a protest against -an artificial methodology which proposes to create artists out of nothing but method. But these are not the only alternatives. It is not the ambition of a scientific Lesthetics to make the unartistic, artistic, or the unappreciative, appreciative, but its true purpose is to understand and criticise artistic pro- ductions and the enjoyment of art as they really exist. Next to the absolute denial of all method, the greatest obstacle to a science of Lesthetics has been the false problems set for it to solve. These problems are: Is aesthetics deductive or inductive, metaphysical or positivistic, integral or partial? This very manner of statement betrays a lack of understanding of method in general. eFsthetics like any other science must be all of these things in due measure. It must be inductive in that it gathers suggestions from experience, deductive in that it constructs hypotheses on the basis of the suggestions, and inductive again in that it carries the hypotheses to experience for verification. The metaphysical element in aesthetics is its technique, i. e., the dominating ideal of the art and the forms appropriate for the realization of the ideal. The matter in Lesthetics is empirical or positivistic. iEsthetics must be partial in that investigation by particular people is of necessity limited and special, but it is integral in that its ideal is a systematic whole. Thus aesthetic method is not defined by any of these terms to the exclusion of others. There are, however, three important problems which a true critique must solve: Does the aesthetic value exist as value or as fact? Can it be generalized? Is it autonomous or heteronomous? Answers to these questions would properly limit the conception of aesthetic method. KATHERINE EVERETT.</page><page sequence="7">NO. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 46i- The Moral Argument of Theism. GEORGE A, BARROW. Harv. Theol. Rev., IV, I, pp. Ii9-035. The moral argument of theism has for a long time not been subjected to a thoroughgoing logical analysis. Morality is a specifically human conception; it is a concept of the will, and deals with our social conduct. It is essentially finite in nature. It does not necessarily involve physical nature, as is recog- nized by popular religion. If the world be imperfect, its imperfection argues against God's existence; if it be perfect, it needs no ulterior explanation. The question as to whether the existence of the idea of morality demands the existence of a deity may be divided into two questions: Whether the existence of the moral judgment implies a God, and whether the existence of the moral will implies a God. As conscience is based on instinct, it implies nothing transcending humanity. The.power of judgment, in general, may have arisen from man's conflict with nature. Either all will is moral, or all can be, at its purest. One can deduce no theism- from the first, for it implies no universal power; in the second case, we deduce morality from a preconceived concept, which is not obtained by any induction from morality. Our real problems are, then, (I) What is the place of moral will in the universe, and (2) What does it logically imply? The chief task of modern theology in regard to the first question is to harmonise the so-called 'Christian' virtues with the laws and theories of organic evolution. If the presence of will in the world prove the existence of God, it must be because will partakes of the true nature of being. The real question here is, 'Is God good?', not 'Does He exist?' This latter must be settled on other grounds. N. WIENER. La vie psychique des animaux. E. WASMANN. Rev. Ph., X, 9-i0, pp. 314-322. One of the most disputed questions of psychology is whether animals are mere automata, or whether they have some sort of conscious life, and, granting the latter, how far this resembles the conscious life of man. Another question of the first importance is that of the mode and course of psychic evolution. The method of investigation is necessarily the comparison of the supposed evidences of conscious life in the animals with the behavior of man: The only psychic life we can know directly is our own; that of animals can be known only by analogy. It is one of the fundamental principles of animal psychology never to attribute the higher faculties to animals when their actions can be explained by assuming the lower faculties alone. The mechanistic interpre- tation of animal life has been found incompetent to explain the fact that animals learn by experience. The anthropomorphic interpretation is also untenable. The source of this error is the assumption-made necessary by the Darwinian theory-that human intelligence has 'arisen by evolution. An animal has not the capacity for forming abstract ideas, whether from its own experience or through the teaching of another; it has no spiritual life, but a mere life of sense. Hereditary instincts often mimic reason, as with certain ants. In-</page><page sequence="8">462 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. vestigation has shown that certain animals that were for a time considered as having reason, are utterly incapable of reflection. Man is the only animal that has an intellectual life. N. WIENER. Realism a Defensible Doctrine. JOHN E. RUSSELL. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., VII, 26, pp. 70I-708. Realism only says that reality is not constituted by assent. Royce argues against it as follows: The realities of the realist are absolutely unrelated; therefore no one of them can know any other. The realist's idea and its object are both realities; the one cannot cognise the other. The realist, however, denies only the relation of dependence between realities; the realist's idea and its object, furthermore, need not be separate realities. Taylor gives two arguments against realism: First, the realist's doctrine contradicts the nature of reality; secondly, the realist is forced to define the unreal and the real alike, -independence of the human mind. The first argument can only disprove a realist ontology, not realism. In the second case, the realist need not think of independence of mind as constituting reality. It has been urged against realism that we can never know that an idea represents its object. However, idealism also fails to give us a road to absolute certainty. N. WIENER. Motive. J. L. STOCKS. Mind, No. 77, pp. 54-66. Most definitions fail to explain the popular distinction of motives into con- scious and unconscious. For a provisional definition of motive, let us say that motive is that disposition of a man in respect to an act in virtue of which it possesses an attraction for him. It demands some degree of reflexion, and is not applicable to acts done instinctively. It is the manifestation of a general attitude of the will. Unlike intention, it implies no end; it is something, so to speak, at the back of one's mind, which influences one's decision. It is not the feeling of teleological action, for a feeling cannot be a motive. Con- sciousness of motive is attention to that in the act adopted which makes it of service to the realization of the end which motive is the disposition to pursue. Unconscious motive differs from conscious motive simply in being more ob- scure. Motive cannot be sharply distinguished from character. N. WIENER. Le rile de l'individu dans la formation de la morale. J. M. LAHY. Rev. Ph., XXXV, 12, PP. 58I-599. In explaining morality as a social product, sociologists neglect the r6le of the individual in the formation of ethical sentiment. An individual's acts and attitude are determined by his ideas, and his ideas are mental represen- tations or images of sensible objects. To test the accuracy of the material of his notions, he has only to refer them again and again to sensible experience. This is the final criterion. Representations are associated and combined in all sorts of ways. For example, compare the looseness of connection in the</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 463 conversation of a lunatic with the closely-knit logic of Socrates. In general, the way an individual combines his ideas depends upon his social heritage and his environment. Every idea is accompanied by movement, conscious or unconscious. Among the classes of action thus related to human thought is moral action, whose distinguishing characteristic is its right to be termed good or bad, and its grounding in sanction. From the social standpoint, morality is an ideal of action worked out by society and sanctioned by it, which de- termines one's acts. But individuals often transcend or oppose an existing system of morality as sanctioned by society. The extent to which individual initiative is desirable depends upon the relation of the innovation to the ex- isting order. The innovation should be assimilable. The more exact knowl- edge, i. e., the more science, a man is master of, the better fitted he is to be a moral leader and reformer. For underlying every stable system of morality there must be a firm foundation of clear and rational knowledge. Whether or not a man's original theory of conduct is wise and good will be quickly proved by the sort of welcome it receives in that particular social group to which he belongs. A complete definition of morality then is: An ideal of action, worked out by society and sanctioned by it, which determines one's acts, and which the individual can modify so long as the ideal which he has created is not contradictory to the scientific representations of the group to which he presents it. KATHERINE EVERETT. Die exper'imentelle Untersuchung des Willensaktes. OTTO SELZ. Z. f. Psych., LVII, 4, pp. 241-270. Ach's work Ober den Willensakt und das Temperament renders voluntary action accessible to experimental research. His method may be called the combination method, since it is a combination of Ebbinghaus's method of repetitions and Muller's method of right associates. These principal problems are investigated-the phenomenal side of will, its dynamical side, and the motives and conditions under which it appears. The most extreme form of voluntary action which is the basis of his considerations, Ach calls primary voluntary action. Qualitatively, he recognizes four characteristics of volition -sensations of strain, the idea of end and of reference, the resolve I will really (which is the principal characteristic), and the attitude of effort. It is very doubtful, however, whether the object of Ach's investigation really is volition. For instance, in his experiments on the resolve to accept the instructions, he seems rather to be investigating the effort of will directed toward the realization of the already accepted resolve. Ach, moreover, believes that he can show a connection between his conception of will and that of Wundt and Lipps, but it is difficult to see where such an agreement lies. In his quantitative investigation of the dynamical aspect of will, he measures the strength of the determination to carry out the task by the number of repetitions which pre- viously established what he calls the reproduction tendency. Under his third problem, Ach treats of the voluntary act, the secondary volition, feeling and</page><page sequence="10">464 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. temperament. By the term voluntary act, Ach understands the realization of the objective contents of the will. He investigates the complete voluntary act, for which the presence of the idea of reference-the means of realization, as he calls it-is necessary. He confines himself to the simple voluntary act, though his experiments really offer no favorable conditions for this in- vestigation. If favorable factors are present, then the apprehension of the idea of reference is bound up with familiarities and produces the desired idea of movement. If, on the other hand, inhibitory factors are present, the inter- mediary experiences occur as an associated idea or the content of the aim in the form of an abbreviated will. There are three forms of the secondary will-the abbreviated will, the weak will, and the practised will. With practice, all forms are gradually transformed into the automatic act. A secondary result of Ach's investigation is that it throws light on the doctrines of feeling and of temperament. The origin of feeling depends on the efficacy of the determination. These so-called determinedfeelings coincide in part with the constellation feelings of Lipps and the intellectual feelings of Wundt. The whole work, despite its faults in certain details, is rich in suggestion and shows a marked advance in method. It is only by strong self-criticism that experimental psychology can hope to escape the unceasing controversy over will, due to the present unsatisfactory condition of things. MABEL E. GOUDGE. Practice Effects in Free Association. F. L. WELLS. Am. J. Ps., XXII, I, Pp. I-I3. This is the first investigation of the effects of practice in free association. There were eight subjects in the experiment, one man, a physician in middle life, and seven women, nurses, with one exception under 30 years of age. In terms of Jung's classification, five of the subjects belonged to the Sachlicher Typus of association, one to the Prddikattypus, and two to the Konstella- tionstypus. One thousand different stimulus-words were used, which were unambiguous and familiar to the subjects. The words were written on sep- arate slips of paper which were put into a box and thoroughly shaken. These slips were drawn by chance and made into 20 series of 50 words each. One series was given to each of six of the subjects each day until the entire number of series had been given. Then, on the two following days, the first two series of 50 words were repeated. The results are based on these 6,6oo observations; especially on the two series which were repeated. The two other subjects made 500 observations each. The results show (i) a decrease in the associ- ation time; (2) a diminution of the individual differences in association time; (3) a differentiation and particularization of the response; (4) a tendency for the whole body of responses to move down in the scale of associations; and (5) a decrease in the emotive value of the experiment.

James's pluralistic metaphysics presupposes a methodology which he called radical empiricism, and its keynote lies in his definition of truth. The realist separates the world and the subject until he has no means of telling whether ideas are true or false copies of the eternal reality; the idealist makes both object and subject of the same nature, and deduces the individual facts a priori. Pragmatism believes in an external and independent reality, but one which is in harmony with the idea and which is of the same nature as that idea, since together they form the whole of experience. The true idea is the one which can be verified by the course of events and its verification consists in its applicability to the different facts of experience. The true is the expedient in our way of thinking and acting. For Dewey and Schiller verification and truth are two names for the same thing, but for James the truth of an idea lies in its ability to be verified. They agree, however, that the idea can never transcend the actual experience. Pratt objects that such a theory breaks down when the truth of ideas concerning experiences of past history, or the recognition of facts in the experiences of others, is under consideration. It is also conceivable that two people can form contradictory opinions of the same fact and each verify his opinion by experience. If each opinion is true, logic is impossible. To the first objection, James answers that we have sufficient confirmation for our belief through historical works and a consensus of opinion. In the second case, the pragmatist, like the idealist, can only believe in the existence of others. If disbelief in them would produce the same effect, the distinction between their existence and non-existence would be verbal. But the human soul demands more than the appearances of other beings,-it demands their sympathy and the response of their personalities to its own. For a similar reason we assume an external world; it is a means of satisfying desires. Our beliefs, however, are not true merely because they are satis- fying; they must respond to an actual experience. There is no inherent truth in a proposition which exists when the individual and his assertions concerning it are suppressed. Its truth is a fact which is completed by adaptation and action. The pragmatist would admit that there is something in the true proposition which explains its success, but that something resolves itself into terms of actual experience, past, present, or possible. Pragmatism, indeed, approaches a philosophy of common sense in that it states, by the common use of words, that truth is that which is useful for an end. To level everything to its cash value seems perhaps to imply a moral materialism, an emphasis upon man's animal instead of his rational nature. But the pragmatist takes the world as he finds it. If man has a dual nature, both sides are considered in determining what is useful. To all objections which impute relativism, James replies by invoking the consensus of opinion of all thinking beings. Man is an individual, but also a part of society. By the elimination of irrecon- cilable individual opinions, science is formed. Experience is possible only as there is a harmonizing of thought among individuals.

Instinct and intelligence are generally considered as two distinct modes of mental activity but they are everywhere inseparable. The relation of instinct to intelligence is essentially similar to that of object and subject. Intelligence and instinct, choice and tropism, finalism and mechanism are our necessary anthropo-psychic interpretations of one and the same problem regarded from different standpoints. The rudiments of conation and meaning are present in instinctive acts of all kinds excepting under two conditions, namely, if there has been sufficient repetition of the act, or if the instinct is from the first unalterable. The subjective aspects of so-called instinctive and intelligent behavior differ only in degree. As to the alleged objective difference, the fixity of instinct which is contrasted with the plasticity of intelligence, we find from observation of wasps and ants that our criteria for intelligence is just as applicable to instinctive behavior. Insect life is fully explicable on the hypothesis of a series of reactions which are to some extent plastic and modi- fiable and which involve all the signs of conation and attention. Instincts are, within limits, impro?vable and have the feeling of activity and consciousness of end. To the list of instincts may we not add thought, reason, intelligence? The only difference between animal and human intelligence is one of degree, and we may also recognize in animal life occasional dim flashes of higher spiritual powers. Instincts, then, while not identifiable with reflexes, are not a tertium quid besides reflexes and intelligence, and we should speak, not of instinct and intelligence, but of instinct-intelligence. From the philosophical standpoint there is place for a finalistic interpretation: finalism is traceable to our experi- ience of subject-activity, mechanism to our experience of object-activity. This subjective, finalistic, intelligent factor is not merely the awareness of ends but also distinct awareness that they are ends, and an increasing power to modify and frame fresh ends. A. S. EDWARDS. Social Consciousness and the Consciousness of Meaning. G. H. MEAD. Psych. Bul., VII, I2, Pp. 397-405. Only in the relation of mutual adjustment of social stimulation and response to the activities which they ultimately mediate, can the consciousness of mean- ing arise. It consists mainly in a consciousness of attitude on the part of the individual toward the object to which he is about to react. The feelings of readiness to take up a book, to spring over a ditch, to hurl a stone, are the stuff out of which arises a sense of meaning of the book, the ditch, the stone. The recurrence in memory of the past experience is the content which is com- monly supposed to mediate this consciousness of meaning. An immediate content of sensation assimilates a content of imagery that insures a certain response. This assimilation in no sense guarantees a consciousness of dis- tinguishable meaning. The more complete the assimilation, the less conscious are we of the actual content of response. That with which we are most familiar</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES 467 is least likely to be distinguished in direct conduct in terms of meaning. That this familiarity is still a guarantee that upon demand we can give a meaning illustrates the point at issue: the bringing into consciousness of a meaning content is an act which must in every instance be distinguished from the mere consciousness of stimulation resulting in response. Thus the occasion for the consciousness of meaning is not found in the habitual act, nor is it to be found in the conflict of acts. In the field of social conduct, however, the feels of one's own responses become the natural objects of attention, since they interpret the attitudes of others which have called them out and because they give the material in which one can state his own value as a stimulus to the conduct of others. The elements in this consciousness of meaning are, firstly, a social situation; secondly, the consciousness of the value of one's own gestures in terms of the change in the actions of another; and thirdly, the terms in which this relation appears in consciousness.
