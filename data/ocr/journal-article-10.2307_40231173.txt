<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume X, Number 4, December 1980 On the Rights of Non-Persons DOUGLAS N. HUSAK, Rutgers College Do non-persons have moral rights? I will suppose this question can best be answered by inquiring whether some animals and/or environ- mental objects have moral rights, for if any non-persons are possessors of rights, animals and/or environmental objects are the most plausible candidates. As so interpreted, this question has received an extraor- dinary amount of recent attention from philosophers. Arguments have been offered and defended; rebuttals have appeared in print. Yet, so far as I am aware, no one has presented a clear and accurate statement of what turns on the issue of whether non-persons have moral rights. In the absence of such a statement, philosophers are likely to be at sea in determining on which side of the controversy their initial sympathies lie. In this paper it is my central concern to help clarify what turns on the issue of whether non-persons are possessors of moral rights, rather than to argue decisively for one position or the other. Given what turns on the dispute, I will conclude, contra much recent literature on the sub- ject, that no good reasons have been offered to suppose that non- persons are possessors of moral rights. Moreover, there are weighty (though not conclusive) reasons for supposing that non-persons are not possessors of moral rights. 607</page><page sequence="2">Douglas N. Husak Two Strategies The topic of whether animals and/or environmental objects have moral rights generally is approached according to one of two strategies. Oftentimes philosophers begin by proposing a set of necessary and suf- ficient conditions that must be satisfied by a thing before it can meaningfully be said of that thing that it is able to possess moral rights. Philosophers have disagreed both about the criteria a thing must satisfy in order to be capable of possessing moral rights, as well as about whether such criteria, when applied to non-persons, support the con- clusion that at least some non-persons have rights. Joel Feinberg, for example, has maintained that since animals have interests, there is no objection to concluding that animals possess rights to protect these in- terests.1 H. J. McCloskey agrees with Feinberg's criterion, but concludes that animals do not have interests, and hence cannot be said to be capable of possessing rights.2 Michael Tooley believes that the question of whether non-persons3 can have moral rights depends primarily on whether they are self-conscious, but confesses uncertainty about whether any non-persons are self-conscious and thus is indecisive about whether any non-persons possess moral rights.4 Of course, a sound argument that animals and/or environmental ob- jects are the kinds of things that are capable of having moral rights, or a demonstration that there is no conceptual incoherence in attributing moral rights to non-persons, does not suffice to show that such non- persons actually possess moral rights. To establish this stronger con- clusion, further arguments are required.5 However, it is not always 1 Feinberg, Joel: "The Rights of Animals and Unborn Generations/' in Blackstone, William T., ed.: Philosophy and Environmental Crisis (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1974), p. 43. 2 McCloskey, H.J.: "Rights," Philosophical Quarterly, 15(1965), p. 121. 3 Some philosophers, Tooley among them, distinguish between persons and human beings in that the former, but not the latter, necessarily possess one or more rights. On this interpretation, the question whether animals and/or environ- mental objects possess rights is equivalent to the question whether they are persons. In this paper, I do not distinguish between human beings and persons. 4 Tooley, Michael: "Abortion and Infanticide," Philosophy and Public Affairs," 2 (1971-2), p. 37. 5 Oftentimes such arguments conclude with a conditional: If there are any moral rights possessed by all human beings, then at least some animals possess such rights also. The relevance of this conclusion for the thesis that some non-persons possess rights depends upon whether the antecedent of the conditional is true. 608</page><page sequence="3">On the Rights of Non-Persons necessary to examine such further arguments, insofar as their cogency depends upon the soundness of the prior analysis - for it is unlikely that the above strategy for approaching the question of whether animals and /or environmental objects have moral rights is viable. It is dubious, after all, that the issue of whether non-persons have moral rights should be resolved by conceptual analysis. One who is antecedently convinced that some animals and/or environmental objects actually possess moral rights will employ that conviction as the basis for an objection to any analysis that entails that non-persons cannot have such rights. From his perspective, any such analysis simply begs the question. For example, suppose a philosopher sympathetic to the Hobbesian tradition en- visages morality as based upon self-interest. Such an account might determine questions of membership in the "moral community of right- holders" by inquiring whether inclusion or exclusion of a particular candidate furthers the self-interest of those members already admitted into such a community. This criterion of membership in the community of right-holders will not appeal to defenders of the rights of animals and/or environmental objects. As I will argue below, the inclusion of non-persons into the community of right-holders is not in any straight- forward sense in the interest of persons. A philosopher who is an- tecedently convinced that some animals and/or environmental objects are entitled to membership in the moral community of right-holders will reject the account of the connection between morality and self-interest in the Hobbesian tradition precisely because it leads to the exclusion of non-persons. How might the defenders of such a tradition, or defenders of any position that precludes rights of non-persons respond to such a philosopher? Ultimately, such a response must address itself to the grounds on which such a philosopher is antecedently convinced that some non-persons have moral rights. Examination of the basis of any such antecedent conviction takes us away from the conceptual analysis of the first strategy towards the second approach to be considered regarding the question of whether any non-persons have moral rights. This second strategy proceeds by inquiring what is allegedly gained by concluding that animals and/or environmental objects possess moral rights. According to this strategy, one begins by examining whatever clear intuitions one may have concerning the proper treatment of non- persons. Are there intuitive conclusions about the treatment of animals and/or environmental objects that one is unable to reach without sup- posing such non-persons have moral rights? Or can everything one would like to say about the way animals and/or environmental objects should be treated be said without attributing moral rights to non- persons? There is a sense in which this second strategy subsumes the first. A convincing argument that shows there to be one or more intuitively acceptable conclusions we could not reach without supposing that 609</page><page sequence="4">Douglas N. Husak some non-persons have moral rights also suffices to show that non- persons must be the sorts of things that are capable of having moral rights - for, on this strategy, anything is capable of having moral rights so long as attributing them to such a thing is the only (or the most plausible) means by which we are able to reach conclusions intuitively recognized as correct. This second strategy, then, is preferable insofar as the conclusions it reaches must ultimately be used as at least one im- portant means to assess the plausibility of any given conceptual analysis. To this extent, this second strategy likens moral rights to legal rights. Most approaches to the question whether a given thing possesses legal rights do not begin by inquiring what must be true of something before legal rights can meaningfully be attributed to it. Instead, one begins by deciding about what legal conclusions or results one feels confident, and then determining whether such conclusions could be reached, or results attained, without attributing legal rights to the thing in question. It was by this procedure, for example, that it was decided that cor- porations possess legal rights, e.g., the right to due process of law.6 If corporations lack such a legal right, it would be permissible to treat them in ways that seemed intuitively unacceptable in an adequate legal system. Hence, corporations were said to have certain legal rights. It would be misguided to object to this strategy on the ground that one had not resolved the prior conceptual question of whether corporations are the kinds of things that could meaningfully possess legal rights. For on this strategy, a demonstration that attributing legal rights to cor- porations leads to intuitively better results than withholding such rights suffices also to resolve affirmatively the question of whether cor- porations can have legal rights. The success of such a strategy depends, of course, on our having at least a few clear intuitions regarding the question of how animals and/or environmental objects should be treated. One would not want to begin this inquiry by supposing the truth of a controversial moral position such as vegetarianism. In the hope of securing widespread agreement, I will hazard only one such intuition - it is wrong to deliberately inflict ex- treme pain on certain animals for certain purposes; e.g., it is wrong to set fire to a cat simply because one enjoys the crackling sound made by its burning fur. Further, I will suppose that such an act is not wrong merely because of its effects on the persons who perform or observe it, but rather because of its effects on the unfortunate cat. Most persons who have rejected this intuition, I suspect, have done so as a result of theoretical convictions, e.g., a belief that cats are not the sort of things 6 See Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 118 U.S. 394 (1886). 610</page><page sequence="5">On the Rights of Non-Persons capable of being wronged.7 But if we begin this inquiry with our in- tuitions, rather than revising such intuitions in the light of subsequent theoretical analysis, I believe the above intuition is sufficiently uncon- troversial to represent a fruitful point of departure. Two Fallacies A second possible ground for rejecting the truth of the above in- tuition is that it begs the question in favor of animal rights. Such a criticism, however, represents the first of two pervasive fallacies about the rights of non-persons to which attention should be drawn. If we concede at the outset that the cat is wronged by being set on fire, are we not committed to holding that the cat has a right not to be set on fire? I believe such an inference to be fallacious, and a source of much con- fusion about rights. There may be a trivial sense in which it is true that if action A done to thing 7 is wrong, then 7 must have a right that A not be done to it. But presumably this tivial sense is not what is at issue in the controversy about whether non-persons have moral rights. Many wrong actions do not violate rights. Suppose, for example, that I have finished reading my newspaper on the train, and I do not wish to keep this paper for any purpose. A person sitting next to me asks if he may read it. In- stead of giving my newspaper to him, I tear it to pieces. Intuitively, I think, we would agree that such an action is wrong, and that the person who is "wronged" by my behavior is the person who requested to read the paper. Yet it does not follow that this person had a right to read my newspaper, even in the circumstances described above. My failure to share my newspaper is wrong, though it is not an instance of a wrong action that violates a right. Much contemporary legal and political philosophy has paid insufficient attention to that class of wrong actions that does not involve the violation of one or more rights. When the existence of this class of actions is recognized, it becomes clear that one 7 See, e.g., the collection of historical treatments of the rights of non-persons in Regan, Tom and Singer, Peter, eds.: Animal Rights and Human Obligations (Prentice-Hall, 1976). Note especially Rickaby, Joseph: "Of the So-called Rights of Animals," p. 179, and Ritchie, D. C: "Why Animals Do Not Have Rights," p. 181. Of course, if someone claimed to simply intuit that animals have rights, my second strategy would not be viable. My approach makes the assumption that statements about rights should be treated as conclusions, and not as premisses of arguments. 611</page><page sequence="6">Douglas N. Husak can concede that setting fire to a cat is wrong without also conceding that such an act violates one or more rights possessed by the cat. Examples of this first fallacy are so commonplace in philosophical literature that one hardly needs to provide evidence of its commission. Perhaps the most conspicuous example of this fallacy is contained in the following single sentence: "Since we are unwilling to say that it is all right to kill or torture [infants, the mentally retarded, and the senile,] we seem to assume that they have certain rights."8 I suspect the reason this fallacy is so pervasive is due to a failure to notice important differences in the functioning of moral and legal rights. The primary rules of a legal system are expressed exclusively in terms of rights and obligations; if an action is not legally "all right," it must violate one or more legal rights. But not all the practical principles of a moral system are expressible in terms of rights and duties. Hence the existence of a class of actions (viz., those that are wrong but violate no right) that have no counterpart in legal discourse. When it is suggested that it might be wrong, e.g., to torture an animal, though not violative of a right, I must caution against an objec- tion that is likely to be raised. Someone might respond that my proposed mode of expression does not put the matter strongly enough: "Surely it is worse than merely wrong to torture an animal. Actions that violate rights are worse than those that are merely wrong but do not violate rights, and torturing animals is sufficiently wrong intuitively to support the conclusion that it violates a right." This objection is misguided. Though ordinarily the worst examples of human behavior are those that violate one or more rights, there is no reason to suppose as a general truth that actions that violate rights are always worse than those that are "merely" wrong but do not violate rights. Recall the newspaper example in which it was shown that actions could be wrong that did not violate rights. Suppose now that instead of a newspaper, the wrongdoer had excess food which he perversely preferred to let spoil rather than share with a person who is malnourished. Some philosophers, horrified at the prospect that excess food might be wasted while others are hungry, have gone so far as to maintain that "need con- fers rights."9 But there is no reason to make this claim in order to con- demn the wrongdoer who refuses to share his excess food. It is curious to hold that if I happen to have a metabolism such that I require only 8 Rodman, John: "The Liberation of Nature?", Inquiry, 20 (1 978), p. 83, 88. 9 See Aiken, William: "The Right to be Saved from Starvation," in Aiken, William and La Follette, Hugh, eds.: World Hunger and Moral Obligation (Prentice-Hall, 1977), p. 85. 612</page><page sequence="7">On the Rights of Non-Persons 1500 calories per day, but possess 2500, malnourished persons have a right to the excess 1000, but if I happen to require 2500, the malnourished have no right to anything. Why should the rights of others depend in any way upon my metabolism? It seems less strained to say that the person who refuses to share his excess food commits a wrong act, indeed a very wrong act, even though he has not violated any rights. At least, an argument is required to show that he has violated a right over and above the argument that concludes that he has acted wrongly. Hence I am not minimizing the wrongness of torturing animals by suggesting that such an act may not violate any rights possessed by the animals. Much of the concern for animals and/or environmental objects that the movement in favor of rights of non-persons has sought to exhibit can be shown without attributing rights to animals and/or environmental objects. The distinction between obligations to and obligations concer- ning helps avoid the second (and less pervasive) fallacy committed by some proponents of rights of non-persons. Many environmentalists have properly called our attention to the extent to which the interests of human beings could be promoted by better care of animals and our en- vironment. We are reminded that our ecosystem is in a state of delicate equilibrium, and subtle interferences with some element of that ecosystem could/would have repercussions that are contrary to the long-term interests of persons. But its being wrong, and even a violation of one or more rights, to pave a wilderness area to build a resort does not entail that rights must be attributed to wilderness areas. The obligation violated may be owed to persons, though it concerns or regards the wilderness area. On this account, the obligation not to pave the wilderness area is owed to my fellow human beings, though the sub- ject matter of the obligation concerns the wilderness area itself. I am unconvinced that we cannot express everything we would want to say about the way in which animals and/or environmental objects should be treated without appealing to the rights of non-persons. Our most obvious intuitions about the manner in which non-persons should be treated can be expressed without invoking rights by keeping in mind the two distinctions upon which the above fallacies depend, viz., the distinction between wrong actions that do and do not violate one or more rights, and the distinction between obligations to and obligations concerning. At this point a clarification is required. I am merely suggesting that these distinctions could be used to describe all of what we would want to say about the proper treatment of non-persons, not that they should be so used. I am not explicitly arguing that non-persons do not have rights; rather I am questioning the cogency of those arguments designed to show the substantive advantages of supposing that animals and/or environmental objects do have rights. Later I will 613</page><page sequence="8">Douglas N. Husak discuss formidable obstacles that must be overcome by those who ad- vocate rights for non-persons, though I have no conclusive reasons for believing that such obstacles cannot ultimately be surmounted. In order for the above account to be plausible (i.e., in order for it to be possible to express everything we want to say about the proper treatment of non-persons without invoking rights), many philosophers have thought it necessary to argue that persons have obligations to members of future generations. It is unlikely that everything we want to say about the way we are entitled to treat animals and the environment can be expressed solely by reference to the interests of members of the present generation. The intuitively unacceptable practice of breaking down the ozone layer may not have seriously detrimental consequen- ces on the interests of human beings for several generations. But a number of philosophers have been uncomfortable in supposing that persons have obligations to members of future generations.10 To a large extent, this uneasiness is derived from the oddity of attributing rights to members of future generations that are correlative with such alleged obligations. How can non-existent persons have rights? If one is inclined to take seriously the supposed difficulties in maintaining that members of future generations possess rights, he might be led to deny the thesis according to which rights and obligations are correlative. On this ac- count, the fact that members of the present generation have obligations to members of future generations does not entail that the latter have rights against us. This "solution" to the perplexity of how non-existent persons can possess rights is not as suspicious or ad hoc as it may ap- pear. The most straightforward examples in which the correlativity thesis holds are those involving contractual relations between the right- holder and the person who is obligated. Obviously, any obligations we may have to future generations could not be derived from an explicit contract. In cases in which we are obligated by some means other than contractual, it is far less intuitive that the correlativity thesis holds.11 But awareness of the first of the above fallacies committed by some defenders of rights of non-persons suggests a less controversial means by which to circumvent the alleged difficulties of supposing that mem- bers of future generations possess rights. One might plausibly contend 10 For a discussion of the view that persons have obligations to members of future generations, see Sikora, R. I. and Barry, Brian, eds.: Obligations to Future Generations (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1978). 1 1 Some philosophers show no reluctance to abandon the correlativity thesis in the context of discussions of the rights of non-persons. See Fox, Michael: '"Ani- mal Liberation': A Critique," Ethics, 88(1978-9), p. 106, 113. 614</page><page sequence="9">On the Rights of Non-Persons that it is sometimes wrong, though not a violation of an obligation, to treat animals and/or environmental objects in a way that is contrary to what we suppose the interests of future generations will be. Hence it might be wrong to break down the ozone layer, but this conclusion does not entail (even given the truth of the correlativity thesis) that members of future generations possess moral rights. Now there is little doubt that a great deal of our proper concern for animals and/or environmental objects can be justified by appeals to the long-run interests of human beings. It is crucial to appreciate that what cannot be justified by such an appeal does not require that non-persons possess rights. One environmentalist has remarked that "there is something sad about the spectacle" of attempting to ground our con- cern for animals and/or environmental objects by reference to the in- terests of persons.12 The proposal suggested here is not inconsistent with this sentiment. Some actions, e.g., setting fire to cats, are wrong solely because of their effects on non-persons. But attention to the first of the above fallacies should remind us that the conclusion that non- persons have rights does not follow from the admission that not all of our proper concern for animals and/or environmental objects can be expressed by observing the distinction between obligations to and obligations concerning. Hence a proponent of the rights of non-persons faces a heavier bur- den than is generally recognized. One who believes that some legitimate concerns are unexpressible without attributing rights to non- persons must offer an example of an action that is condemned as a violation of an obligation to an animal and/or environmental object, when that same action could not (with equal plausibility) be condem- ned as a violation of an obligation to one or more persons. In the absen- ce of an example that satisfies this description, philosophers are warran- ted in refusing to attribute moral rights to non-persons. A Non-Homocentric Ethic? Many philosophical advocates of the moral rights of non-persons favor the abandonment of a purely "homocentric" or "anthropomor- phic" ethic. If I have correctly described the burden that must be 12 Stone, Christopher D.: Should Trees Have Standing? (New York: Avon Books, 1974), p. 93. 615</page><page sequence="10">Douglas N. Husak sustained before the case in favor of attributing rights to non-persons is persuasive, the ground for rejecting a homocentric ethic is apparent. The clearest example of an action that violated an obligation that could not plausibly be held to be owed to persons would be an action that did not violate an obligation owed to persons because its performance was in the interest of all affected persons. It seems plausible that an action that is in the interest of all affected persons could be shown to violate an obligation only by rejecting the homocentric or anthropomorphic ethic so familiar to moral philosophers. Hence, though it may not be true that the case in favor of attributing rights to non-persons requires the abandonment of a homocentric ethic, it is easy to appreciate why ad- vocates of such rights commonly do so. Indeed, much treatment of animals and/or environmental objects is advocated not because it is in the long-term interest of persons, but rather in spite of the fact that it is contrary to such interests. The attempt to justify treatment of animals and/or environmental objects by maintaining that such treatment con- cerns non-persons, but (insofar as it is obligatory) is owed to human beings, is simply to commit another mistake of the sort that proponents of the rights of non-persons have sought to correct. The rights of animals and/or environmental objects entitle them to protection for their own sakes; if the rights or interests of persons occasionally conflict with these, human rights must at least sometimes give way. The alleged fun- damental mistake to which such philosophers have called attention is the view that nature can best be understood as an instrument for the promotion of human good rather than as intrinsically worthy of protec- tion for its own sake. According to one disciple of a "new ethic," natural objects. . .are degraded by our failure to respect them for having their own existence, their own character and potentialities, their own forms of excellence, their own integrity, their own grandeur.13 Another environmentalist has called "the distortion occasioned by an entirely homocentric" ethic "serious" in its failure to "deal adequately with the notion that nonliving nature exists for itself."14 Hence many such persons insist upon the need for a "new ethic" - and though the details of such an ethic are not agreed upon by all who call for its creation, it is fair to generalize that this new moral philosophy differs from its predecessors in being less "homocentric." 1 3 Rodman, John: "The Liberation of Nature?", Inquiry, 20 (1 978), p. 83, 94. 14 Tribe, Laurence H.: "Ways Not To Think About Plastic Trees: New Foundations for Environmental Law," Yale Law Journal, 83 (1974), p. 1315, 1329. 616</page><page sequence="11">On the Rights of Non-Persons Some critics of traditional moral philosophy have complained that a number of suggestions in favor of attributing rights to non-persons ac- tually do not go far enough in resisting homocentrism. The proposal to "give" or "extend" rights to animals and/or environmental objects is objectionable because it "assimilates] them to the status of inferior human beings."15 "The attempt to produce a 'new ethics' by the process of 'extension' perpetuates the basic presuppositions of the con- ventional modern paradigm, however much it fiddles with the boun- daries."16 What is demanded is a complete revamping of the moral categories in which our proper concern for nature is conceptualized. One should not be too critical in challenging the cogency of those few attempts to formulate this new, non-homocentric ethic. Given the unsolved philosophical difficulties which plague traditional ethical theory, it is not surprising to find that such attempts to radically revamp moral theory are highly problematic. But it is fair at this time to inquire whether the need for such an ambitious project actually has been sub- stantiated. With these remarks in mind, it is instructive to critically examine perhaps the most thoughtful and well-argued attempt to show the substantive importance of attributing rights to non-persons. Chris Stone adopts the second of the two strategies in his attempt to show that environmental objects possess rights.17 A great deal of his case in favor of attributing rights to non-persons depends on his demonstration that "there would be certain changes in the operation of the legal system" that are obviously advantageous.18 Though most of his discussion con- cerns legal rights, it is clear that Stone's case is basically a moral one, for "law, to be stable, must be based on ethics."19 Stone is not unmindful of the long-term benefits to persons should his proposals be adopted. Nonetheless, he deems it necessary to reject the "anthropomorphic hedonistic" ethic and "to consider subordinating some human claims to those of the environment per se."20 He hopes to show, then, the sub- stantive advantages of a legal system or moral theory that countenances obligations to, and not merely concerning, non-persons. 1 5 Rodman, Op. Cit., p. 94. 16 Id. at 95. 1 7 Stone, Op. Cit. 18 Id. at 28. 19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 92. 617</page><page sequence="12">Douglas N. Husak Stone is most persuasive in arguing that a number of fundamental changes are required in our legal system concerning our treatment of environmental objects. To cite one example, he points out that en- vironmental objects "are not the beneficiaries of the law's awards/'21 If I recover in tort against a corporation that has polluted the river ad- jacent to my land, I have no legal obligation to use the damages to clean the river; I may be just as likely to use the windfall to buy a new car. No doubt this problem is a serious one for those who are concerned with environmental protection. Yet such an example does not require an abandonment of the homocentric ethic which Stone repudiates. It is plausible to argue in favor of a requirement that plaintiffs be legally obligated in such circumstances to use at least part of their award for improvement of the damaged environmental object. Such a requirement can be justified, however, by reference to the long-term in- terests of human beings. If Stone's case for conferring rights on en- vironmental objects is convincing, he must provide examples of sub- stantive advantages that could not be achieved by use of the obligation to/concerning distinction. In the remainder of this paper I will raise a number of difficulties which advocates of a new non-homocentric ethic must confront. For the most part, these difficulties consist in showing that even the foremost spokesman for a non-homocentric ethic have unwittingly in- troduced at crucial points the very homocentrism they have claimed to resist. Such a demonstration does not, of course, show that a non- homocentric ethic can not be formulated. Hence, even if the case in favor of attributing rights to non-persons depends upon the formulation of a non-homocentric ethic, my arguments do not establish that non- persons lack moral rights. But such a demonstration points to substan- tive problems which I believe are extremely difficult to solve, yet which must be overcome in any attempt to devise a non-homocentric ethic. Three serious problems reveal the difficulty of resisting homocen- trism altogether. The first concerns the formulation of the criteria by which one decides which animals and/or environmental objects possess rights. The wanton destruction of a wooded area for developmental purposes is the paradigm example of an activity which non- homocentric environmentalists would seek to prohibit in the name of the rights of the affected trees. Yet no one objects to pulling weeds in such a wood. The basis for assigning rights to trees but not to weeds, or at least for assigning different rights to trees and weeds, cannot be based on purely biological criteria. Presumably the basis for the distinction is 21 Id. at 38. 618</page><page sequence="13">On the Rights of Non-Persons that human beings generally find trees more useful and/or attractive than weeds. The point is that it is extremely difficult to devise a criterion according to which some but not all animals and/or environmental ob- jects have moral rights that is not to some degree homocentric. Those philosophers who have been at the forefront of the movement for regarding non-persons as worthy of protection for their own sakes have encountered this difficulty, though they have not always been aware of it. In concluding that some environmental objects should be appointed guardians to protect their alleged rights, Stone writes: No lawyer I know in the real world is about to invest his time going to court to ask for a guardianship over an oyster or an earthworm. And I don't know any judge who would grant the motion if he or she did.22 One may well agree about the absurdity of attributing rights to earth- worms, whether these rights are moral or legal. But the underlying ex- planation of this absurdity is revealing for a philosopher who purports to resist homocentrism. Trees but not earthworms deserve guardians to protect their rights. Is this disparity because earthworms lack the rights of trees, or because, though both have rights, only the rights of trees are worth protecting? However this question is answered, it does not seem that homocentrism has been abandoned. One could hope to surmount this difficulty by the heroic attempt to treat everything in the universe as possessors of rights and worthy of cer- tain treatment for its own sake. After all, the weeds of the forest or grains of sand on the beach are as much environmental objects as the ozone layer. This alternative, however, seems implausible. In the first place, the very manner in which we individuate components of the universe reflects human purposes and values. Moreover, though it is relatively clear what behavior is sought to be proscribed by assigning rights to trees, it is not at all obvious that any conduct whatever (short of that which may violate obligations to persons) should be proscribed in the name of the rights of grains of sand. Rights that do not alter the accep- table range of behavior concerning the manner in which the right- holder may be treated are empty, and the process of assigning rights to each and every element of the universe cuts no moral ice. The second difficulty non-homocentrists must face concerns the response that is proposed when violations of alleged rights of non- persons occur. Stone regards it as a consequence of attributing rights to trees that they be treated as the beneficiaries of any compensation paid 22 Id. at 45, note 12. 619</page><page sequence="14">Douglas N. Husak by persons who have violated these rights. The general difficulty with this suggestion involves the formulation of a non-homocentric criterion by which the quantity and quality of such redress can be determined. Once again, defenders of a non-homocentric ethic have waffled on this issue. The heroic alternative is that damages for violations of rights be assessed by principles of restitution - the violator might be held liable for the cost of restoring the animal and/or environmental object to the condition which it was in, or would have been in, had the violation not occurred. Such a principle, however, has fantastic and thoroughly unacceptable implications, as many non-homocentric environmen- talists have admitted. Stone confesses that we would be foolish to tax ourselves $1,000,000 per year on behalf of sea urchins,23 as a commit- ment to this means to measure damages would require. In discussing alternatives, Stone appeals to the fair market value of the violated right.24 Though he fails to explain precisely how this notion is to be invoked, presumably it would require violators of obligations to compensate the right-holder the difference between the fair market value of the right- holder before and after the violation has occurred. There are numerous difficulties with this proposal that should be noticed in passing. Sometimes the fair market value of an animal and/or environmental ob- ject may be increased as a result of the violation of its alleged right; con- sumers may be willing to pay more for an area that has been de-forested than for one that has not. More often, however, the violation of rights will not change the fair market value of the animal or environmental ob- ject at all, making the alleged rights empty. But it is more important for present purposes to appreciate that this criterion, however it may be explicated in detail, is thoroughly homocentric. The market to which Stone appeals can be none other than the market of human producers and consumers. To place a value on rights by reference to the human market is just a small step away from ascribing rights on the basis of human concerns in the first place. Finally, homocentrism is extremely difficult to surmount in deciding how the rights of animals and/or environmental objects are to be balan- ced against the inevitably conflicting rights of persons. Even those philosophers who have gone so far as to ascribe equal consideration for animals and persons have not claimed that whether one rescues a drowning dog or a drowning person is a matter of moral indifference.25 23 Id. at 70. 24 Id. at 70-72. 25 Singer, Peter: Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals (New York: Random House, 1975).

If conflicts of rights between persons and non-persons are always (or nearly always) to be resolved in favor of the former, one must have serious reservations about the extent to which homocentrism really has been overcome. The problem is no less acute when the rights of non-persons come into conflict with one another. Consider again the example in which limitations of space are such that the tree and the weed cannot both thrive. If such a case represents a conflict of rights at all, and human beings must decide (because the environmental objects cannot) which competing right to uphold, it is difficult to understand how the conflict could be resolved without essential appeals to human interests. Conclusion In this paper I have questioned whether substantive advantages are gained by attributing moral rights to non-persons. Moreover, the ob- stacles to formulating a non-homocentric ethic, on which many have thought the case in favor of attributing rights to animals and/or en- vironmental objects depends, have been shown to be formidable. Hen- ce the reasoning in favor of attributing moral rights to non-persons is at best inconclusive. The reasoning which underlies this conclusion suggests what further work needs to be done by proponents of the moral rights of non- persons. Certainly a clear statement of what substantive advantages are to be achieved by attributing rights to animals and/or environmental ob- jects would be most welcome. In addition, more effort is required to formulate and defend a criterion according to which particular ethics can be categorized as homocentric or non-homocentric. Perhaps most importantly, an understanding of the precise role played by moral rights 26 Bentham seems to have held such a position. See The Principles of Morals and Legislation, Chap. XVII, Sec. IV, Note 1 . 621</page><page sequence="16">Douglas N. Husak in admittedly homocentric moral philosophies would do a great deal to clarify what is at stake in the controversy about the rights of non- persons.27 February 1979 27 Until we are clear about how rights function in their paradigm application (i.e., to persons), we can hardly be expected to appreciate what is at stake in contro- versies about attributing rights to non-persons. If moral rights function as "trumps" to override utilitarian considerations, the consequences of attributing rights to non-persons will be drastic indeed. See Dworkin, Ronald: Taking Rights Seriously (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1977) and the sketchy remarks about "Utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people" in Nozick, Robert: Anarchy, State, and Utopia (New York: Basic Books, 1974). 622</page></plain_text>
