<plain_text><page sequence="1">Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art J. V. S. Megaw A previous article has listed some of the more general problems facing the student of European Iron Age art concerned with the identification of individual 'schools' or craftsmen (Megaw i97ob). Taking up an earlier point to the effect that pattern in the widest sense, rather than figural decoration, may well be the clue to individual attributions in La Tene art, this paper presents the results of more recent work which has tended to suggest that it may not be entirely impossible to select certain groups of objects as being representative of separate and definable artistic traditions or, in the classical art historian's sense, 'workshops'. Of course, this is by no means a pioneering study; Jacobsthal, though one gets the feeling that he was not really concerned with attributions, made some brief suggestions (Jacobsthal I944: I53) not entirely beyond elaboration. In the last fifteen years we have had several important contributions to the study of style groupings. First was Frey's identification of the artistic background to the engraved Schnabelkanne in Besan9on (Frey I955). More recently there have been several papers dealing with a class of material virtually ignored by Jacobsthal, early wheel-turned Stempelkeramik (Kauf- mann I967, Schwappach I969a, b). Consideration of early La Tene decorated weapons (Osterhaus i969) offers a useful introduction to de Navarro's eagerly awaited monograph on the swords of La Tene and the discussion contained therein on the various possible sub-groups of Jacobsthal's 'Hungarian sword style' (de Navarro in press). Also leading directly from Jacobsthal's work, is the recent identification of the 'Waldalgesheim Master' (Jope I97I) and my own comments on what I have termed 'the Disney style' of LT, Ic/Bz (Megaw 1965-6: I22; I97oa: nos 158ff.). For the purposes of the present paper, material is drawn from the earliest phases of La Tene, LT Ia or LT AI-2, of the fifth and earlier fourth centuries B.C., contemporary with the 'Iron Masters' and their rich Celtic 'royal tombs', the Fiirstengreber (Driehaus I965), whose very existence undoubtedly contributed largely to the growth and distribution of early La Tene art itself in the area bounded by the Rhine, Mosel and Saar. The Schwarzenbach workshop The first class of material to be brought together is gold work associated particularly with the graves, often female, of the Hunsriick-Eifel and Middle Rhineland and in particular the areas of Driehaus's 'Rhine-Mosel' (Driehaus 1966) and Schaaff's 'Rhine-Saar' groups (Schaaff I969). There are some three possibly related groups of material which we may</page><page sequence="2">Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art 277 class provisionally under the title of the 'Schwarzenbach workshop' after the open- work bowl mounting from the I849 Kr. St Wendel barrow grave (Jacobsthal i944: no. i8, Megaw i97oa: no. 39) (fig. II: I-2). The key features of this workshop are the variations played on a number of classical themes which are here demonstrated by three separate plant-based motifs: an upper triple leafed half-palmette, a central double lobe 3 - 2 5 6 Figure II I-2: Schwarzenbach, Kr.

Bartlett or comma unit each depending from a double circle which in other contexts becomes a Fischblasenmiister or 'leaf crown', while, below, the same unit forms part of a simplified lotus bud; also to be noted is the punched cable or beaded edging. Closely related are the fragments of open-work mountings found adhering to the mid-fifth-century Attic cups in the side chamber of the Klein Aspergle, Ldkr. Ludwigsburg barrow (Jacobsthal I944: no. 32, Megaw i97oa: no. 41) (fig. I 1:4). The material from this probable female</page><page sequence="3">278 J. V. S. Megaw cremation grave clearly links it with the more northerly 'Rhine-Saar' group. Another important site is that most northern of all Fiirstengrdber, Eigenbilzen in Belgian Lim- burg, again with a cremation and an open-work gold band probably for a drinking horn (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 24, Megaw I97oa: no. 40) (fig. It: 3) like the pair from Klein Aspergle. A cruder but undoubtedly related piece is the open-work strip from Wald- gallschied, Ldkr. St Goar (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 26) (fig. TI: 5). This group of material is basically two-dimensional as is a gold sheet mount from another outlier amongst Fiirstengrdber, Chlum in Bohemia (Filip 1956: obr. 76) (fig. ix: 6). Chlum is one of Schaaff's Ostgruppe, which includes also sites in the Oberpfalz and western Austria. While two-dimensional, the Chlum mount is worked on a single sheet without the cut-out voids and, together with the Eigenbilzen mount, offers a bridge with the second group of the Schwarzenbach workshop. In this group, open-work or at least voids or inlay set off rather more bulbous or three-dimensional versions of the comma-leaf/lotus bud motifs such as are seen on a small mount again from Klein Aspergle (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 22, Megaw I97oa: no. 43) (fig. I2: 3). Two open-work circular bands - possibly again horn mounts - from the Reinheim princess's grave are in this tradition (Keller I965: nos 7-8) (fig. I2: 2), while two gold ?brooch mounts on iron and/or bronze backing, from respec- tively Schwabsburg in Rheinhessen (Jacobsthal I944: no. 21) (fig. 12: 4) and the I851 warrior's grave at Weiskirchen a.d. Saar (Jacobsthal I944: no. 20, Megaw i97oa: no. 46) (fig. 12: i), display again the triple lobed or bud motif. On Weiskirchen, the lobes, which are close indeed to Eigenbilzen, are literally leaf crowns for four clean-shaven faces whose closest parallels are on the Horovicky bronze phalerae from a Bohemian chariot grave (Filip I956: 1I59 and tab. VI, Megaw i97oa: no. 47). The Diirkheim gold-smith and the Auvers disc The use of low relief palmettes or lyre patterns on jewellery associated with rich and mainly female graves of Schaaff's Rhine-Saar group introduces what one might well style as products of the 'Diirkheim gold-smith' and his circle (plate 20), after the native material found in a rich woman's grave at Bad Diirkheim, Kr. Neustadt in the Rheinpfalz. In the grave was a ?fifth-century Etruscan stamnos like that from Klein Aspergle as well as several other Italic imports. The three areas of palmette decoration on the much worn ring from Zerf in the Saarland (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 35) allow one to relate it to the decoration on the smaller gold ring with faces from the Reinheim princess's grave (Keller 1965: no. 2, Megaw i97oa: no. 80) and the small armlet from the Erstfeld, Kt Uri gold hoard - after Reinheim the largest collection of gold work of what clearly must be regarded as products of one and the same workshop (Piggott, 1970: nos 1 13-8). The non-figural elements of the great gold arm-ring from the Rodenbach warrior's grave - well-dated by virtue of the associated imports which include an Attic 'St Valentin' kantharos - identify this piece also as belonging to the Duirkheim goldsmith (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 59, Megaw I97oa: no. 55). Details of the Rodenbach ring, such as the crowning ballusters, link this piece again with the Reinheim rings as well as that (unfortunately destroyed in World War II) from another Rhine-Saar female cremation grave at Besseringen, Kr. Merzig-Wadern (Jacobsthal I944: no. 41, Haffner i966: 170-2, Megaw 197oa: no. 56). In parenthesis, in support of Jacobsthal's observation that 'the</page><page sequence="4">Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art z79 1 mrTm. -, ....,,... .... 2 3 O Figure I2 I: Weiskirchen a.d.

Bartlett same workshops produced gold and bronze, or at least used the same patterns', one may note the heavy ridged treatment of feathers or pelts on the heraldic birds of Besseringen, the Reinheim cock fibula (Keller I965: no. 14) and the birds on the gold rings from the same find (plate 21), the fibula from the Panensky Tynec, Louny flat grave (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 3X8, Megaw 197oa: no. 65), the larger gold rings from Erst- feld, and the fragmentary Borsch, Kr. Bad Salzungen flagon (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 383,</page><page sequence="5">280 J. V. S. Megaw Megaw i97oa: no. 66). The cross-hatching on the last three finds would seem to be a particularly individual metal worker's motif, while the location of the Borsch flagon - used, like the Etruscan Schnabelkanne from Besseringen and other sites, as a cremation container - is another indication of the extent to which certain products of craftsmen at least based on the Rhineland were traded. We may elaborate on Jacobsthal's comment and note that clearly the same workshops also produced a very varying range of objects - consider the stylistic similarities of details of the Basse-Yutz flagon handles (Jacobsthal I944: no. 381, Megaw i97oa: nos 6o-i), the belt-hook from the x85I Weiskirchen Fiirstengrab (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 350, Megaw I97oa: no. 62), the well-known Masken- fibel from Parsberg in the Oberpfalz, and the double dog-headed brooch from the Leopoldau, Vienna cemetery (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 3I5A). The actual piece from the Bad Diirkheim grave selected as the type object of the products of the 'Diirkheim gold-smith' is the hollow gold arm-ring with its triple setting of adorsed heads and back- bone of raised circles (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 57, Megaw i97oa: no. 54); these last link us once more to Besseringen. The great staring eyes, the sharp nose and chin can all be matched on the Reinheim and Erstfeld rings (plate 22). A western variation on the themes of our first-mentioned Schwarzenbach workshop is represented by another probable phalera, the gold-covered disc from a barrow at Auvers-sur-Oise which may be added to Schaaff's Marnegruppe of Fiirstengrdber (Jacobsthal 1944: no. i9, Megaw i97oa: no. 42) (fig. 13: 3). Together with the shield mounts from 'Le Mont Blanc', tItrechy in the Marne (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 376, Stead 1968: 176) (fig. I3: i) and another Marnian find, a bronze fragment from Mairy, grave 47 (Jacobsthal I944: no. 379) (fig. 13: 2), Auvers displays a freer use of the classical lyre and lotus bud motif employing what might be termed a 'swashbuckling S' - not un- related to work of the Diirkheim goldsmith, such as the ring from Zerf. The 'swash- buckling S' appears also on the cast handles of the Reinheim (Keller I965: no. I2, Megaw I97oa: no. 73) and Diirrnberg barrow XVI flagons (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 382, Megaw i97oa: no. 72). Reverting to Auvers, as previously pointed out, there is more than a hint of a human face in each pair of S's, a hint made more explicit if one looks at the open-work belt mount from skeleton burial 2 of Diirrnberg grave 44 (Haarlem i963: no. x6, Megaw i97ob: 274), a burial with suggestions of contact with the Marne no less than the Rhine-Saar region. On the Diirrnberg mount the central feature can be read. as a heavily stylized face with forked beard and clinging S curls in the manner of the Basse-Yutz flagons and related pieces following ultimately Etruscan archetypes (Megaw 1965-6: ioiff. and abb. 2). Specialist engravers in early La Tene art To move now to some of the clearest evidence in early La Tene art for specialist crafts- men operating probably over a wide area but with a distinctive stylistic trade-mark. Mention has been made of the I85 I Weiskirchen find. The Italic beaked flagon from this woman's grave, like that from Besangon, was decorated by its Celtic owners with engraving - in this case what has commonly but erroneously been termed 'rocked tracer' work, a technique to be further commented on below - combining arcaded or 'scale' decoration, zig-zags, bead-and-reel, and half-moon motifs (Haffner I966: 214).</page><page sequence="6">Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art 281 2 Figure 13 I: 'Le Mont Blanc', Etrechy, Marne.

Bartlett Although on the Weiskirchen flagon these motifs are crudely applied, they appear exe- cuted in simple line with engineering precision employing compasses on a group of objects once more from Fiirstengriber; a terret from a chariot grave at Laumersheim Kr. Frankental has around its curved rim not only a cast and inlaid mounting whose decoration is related to the 'Schwarzenbach' motifs, but a pattern of intersecting arcs set off by alternate segments of punched dot ornamentation (Kimmig I944-50: esp. abb. I) (fig. I4: 2). This dotting is a key point to look for on another widely distributed group of objects. The same arcs can be seen on objects from three peripheral areas already referred to: the fragmentary bronze flagon from Eigenbilzen (fig. 14: 5-6), the Celtic 'pilgrim flask', as Marien observed some years ago, from Diirrnberg grave 44 (Marien 1962, Penninger and Hell I960: taf. 45-6) (fig. :4: I), and aphalera from yet another Bohemian Fiirstengrab, a chariot burial with cremation at Zelkovice, okr. Beroun (Dehn 1966: abb. i i). Another piece from Chlum, a bronze terminal fitting, uses the same basic motif</page><page sequence="7">282 7. V. S.

(fig. 14: 4). This sieve, however, like the Eigenbilzen flagon fragment, incorporates other motifs, 'S' patterns (fig. 15: 3), dots-in-circles, pendant triangles and the like, which, when set out in a visual 'grammar' following the model devised by Jacobsthal, can clearly be seen as elements bordering that most complex decorated of all objects employing simple scribed line and punch dotting, the spouted flagon from the lower Waldalgesheim chariot grave (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 387, Megaw 197oa: no. 78) (fig. I5: i). The other motifs of the engraved ornamentation of the Waldalgesheim flagon - executed, as previously suggested, by an independent specialist not necessarily other- wise concerned with the manufacture of the vessel - offer a point of reference back to the 'S' or lyre-based patterns of our Schwarzenbach workshop. The Hoppstadten sieve has one area of decoration on its unfortunately now incomplete rim which, though still engraved ornamentation, seems to be executed free-hand instead of with any mechanical aids. As it survives, the design may appear to defy reconstruction; however, we may compare it with details of the horses and 'serpent' on the famous sword scabbard from Hallstatt grave 994 (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 96, Megaw 197oa: no. 30, Dehn 1970), whose non-figural decoration includes incised motifs also to be found on Hopp-</page><page sequence="8">Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art 283 1 tt-- ,' s'"t ' :- , - ,'i -4v8N "' ^-^^^V^ '4wiVWwg Iv ~~~~~~-5 .%%,.?.. ^; 6 ---\ %v .'

Bartlett stadten and Eigenbilzen- as well as on aphalera from Bohemia discussed by Dehn (Dehn I966: I37-9 and abb. 7) in connection with that from 2elkovice. We may also look at the more crudely drawn upside-down heraldic supporters on the Stupava plaque (Filip I956: obr. 79, Powell x966, Megaw I97oa: no. 64), and all three objects may be seen as exhibiting a closely-related use of engraved line applied to a typical Celtic reduction of natural or supernatural forms to abstract decora f bre tive units. The same process can be seen in a somewhat later and very different object of probably local Bavarian origin- the stamp Drawing: A. SA MBre decorated Linsenflasche from Matzhausen (Jacobsthal D944: no. 2o0, Megaw I97oa: no . 7). Matzhausen, no less than the Hallstatt scabbard, incidentally, seems to the present writer to indicate that an Italian source for the Stupava crouching beasts is a more profitable area to go searching for 'orientalizing' origins than the recently preferred tendency to look towards contemporary Scythian or Achaemenian material for all such elements (Powell 1966: I35, Berciu 1971: 263, Sandars 1971).

V. S. Megaw Parsberg Maskenfibel (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 316, Megaw 197oa: no. 63), the plaque, like all the other and certainly more westerly Czechoslovak finds cited here, cannot be any- thing other than a product of a craftsman ultimately from the general Rhineland region. At the beginning of the above remarks on specialist engravers the crude Celtic embellishment of the Weiskirchen Schnabelkanne has been referred to. This is executed in what should be called 'rocked graver' or more precisely 'rolled round-nosed graver' technique (Lowery, Savage and Wilkins 1971: 174-5). This technique, first used extensively on south German belt-plates of Hallstatt Di, is seen at its most complex on three very different objects, the sword scabbard from Bavilliers, Territoire de Belfort (Osterhaus I969: I37ff. and abb. 2: i, Megaw I968) (fig. 15: 5, 6), the strange sheet- bronze beaked mount from a barrow grave at Weitbruch, Haguenau (fig. 15: 4) and the real tour deforce of all early La Tene engraved work, the design on the body of the Rein- heim gilt-bronze flagon (Drack 1966: 134-5 and abb. 7-9) (fig. 15: 2). Once more a grammar of ornamental motifs illustrates, more clearly perhaps than any other group here postulated, the existence of a distinct artistic identity. The peripatetic nature of Celtic craftsmen, as well as their goods, must go a long way towards explaining the occasional establishment of local sub-styles in the early La Tene period, apparently far from the key Rhineland-Mosel area. One such example is the small but important group of belt-plates and associated objects (again making some use of the rocked-graver) from eastern France and the neighbouring Swiss canton of Vaud recently studied by Drack (I966), and clearly associated with the much more skilled products just discussed. Another and somewhat later French group of free-hand engraving style is, of course, the Besan9on flagon and its parallels (Frey I955; Schwappach I969a: 265 and abb. 24). Distribution, trade and culture-contact Two problems hardly touched on above concern dating and distribution. As to dating, the obvious interrelationships of varying early La Tene workshops suggest a greater degree of contemporaneity than is perhaps usually recognized. A second question is how to distinguish from seemingly scattered distributions whether we are dealing with mobility of objects or craftsmen -whether our postulated style groupings actually reflect the work of individual workshops, or simply represent artificial and non-proven divisions in a much more generalized artistic tradition. Naturally, one would hope that this last is an over-gloomy prognostication, and this concluding section briefly comments on three groups of objects of early La Tene date which, while demonstrating the problems of interpreting such distributions of both objects and stylistic influences, hopefully may vindicate the basic premise of this paper - that style grouping of early La Tene art is a genuine possibility and not an unobtainable ideal. First is a simple distribution which represents direct trade from an original manu- facturing source - the spread of brooches, Masken- or Tierkopffibeln, marked by having a pair, or occasionally three, cast balls set around the spring, a form which may be termed the 'Oberwittighausen type' after the four well-known examples from a barrow grave at Oberwittighausen, Kr. Tauberbischofsheim (Jacobsthal I944: nos 303, 312-14, Megaw I97oa: nos 9I-4; for list see Megaw i97ia: 212-I3) (fig. i6).

Figure i6 Distribution of brooches of the 'Oberwittighausen' type. Drawing: A. S. M. Bartleft * Dirlrnberg</page><page sequence="11">286 J. V. S. Megaw includes at least ten from graves in Bavaria, some dozen miniature brooches of the Ober- wittighausen class found their way to that north-eastern outpost of the La Tene Celts in central Germany, the hill-fort of the Kleiner Gleichberg, Kr. Meiningen. The Kleiner Gleichberg, commanding the route between the Rh6n Mountains and the Thuringian Forest, is close to the salt supplies of the Wirra Valley - as well as, incidentally, the find spot of the Borsch flagon. It would seem, like another great centre of Iron Age salt trade, Diirrnberg bei Hallein, where another group of Oberwittighausen brooches has been found, that the Kleiner Gleichberg attracted objects by way of direct barter or gift from the more central regions of La Tene control. To such secondary concentrations one must of course add the occasional piece transported in the course of pioneering settlement - witness products of the Schwarzenbach workshop and related objects in Bohemian Fiirstengrdber as well as two Oberwittighausen brooches from the same area. This point can be even more clearly made by citing the later 'Waldalgesheim Master' and his circle, whose products may be found in the Rhineland, Bohemia, northern Italy (Megaw i97oa: nos 132-9) and the Balkans, or the third-century B.C. 'Disney style', a sub-group of Jacobsthal's more generalized 'Plastic style', which stretches over and beyond the total confines of the continental Celtic settlement area. The mobility of closely related products of Celtic craftsmen is of course also clear within the early period we have been considering in the present paper - apart from examples already quoted, there are the Basse-Yutz jugs and their artistic relatives already briefly referred to, or the bearded cat faces of one of the brooches from the Oberwittighausen type-site (Jacobsthal I944: no. 312, Megaw I97oa: no. 92) and that from the Chynovsky Haj barrow grave outside Prague (Filip 1956: tab. III: i6, Megaw I97oa: no. 90). A clear indication of travelling craftsmen-traders is the 'orientalizing' Erstfeld hoard itself, well on the way to northern Italy and beyond the area of the western Swiss flat cemeteries with their cultural associations with the Rhine-Mosel-Saar region. This cultural link between Switzerland and the Rhineland is borne out by the distribution of mainly neck- and arm-rings exhibiting two closely related stylizations of human faces (fig. I7): the 'Horchheim class' in which the face is reduced to a number of wedge- shaped units, the eyes often ridged and either oval or circular in form (fig. I8: i), and the 'Andernach class' worked up on tubular rings with even more abstracted, if slightly more three-dimensional, features constructed from double scribed lines (fig. I8: 2). Petschaft- halsringe are common in both classes (Megaw 1967, 1970c). The concentration in the Hochwald-Nahe crafts-centre of Joachim's Hunsriick-Eifel-Kultur II A (Joachim i968: esp. I2Iff.) - some half a dozen rings from the Losheim, Kr. Merzig-Wadern barrow group alone (Gross and Haffner I968: esp. 100) - seems to establish beyond doubt the area where this particular style group was evolved. The concentration of Andernach class objects in western Switzerland, on the other hand, may indicate that in this case it was the craftsman and not just his products that travelled. However this may be, the Horchheim face with its ridged eyes has little or nothing to do with the ultimately Italic- influenced faces we find on gold- or bronze-work of true Fiirstengrdber art. It is true that very similar native formulations can be seen on the bearded handle face of the Reinheim flagon, the brooch fragment from Ksice, Strfbro (Filip 1956: obr. 12: 2, Megaw i97Ia), the Diirkheim bronze-covered iron nail (Jacobsthal 1944: no. i65, Megaw I97oa: no, 74), and the belt-hook from 'K6nigsfeld', Raschied, Barrow Di (Dehn i95ib: 43-4,</page><page sequence="12">Plate i Head of a horse from the great fresco (I6-5 by 12 centimetres) Plate 2 The stampede of animals (62'5 by 41 centimetres) _ V IX -4W ANWA Iv W MOMMM _w , _iz -i~- - "VM I</page><page sequence="13">Plate 3 Detail from the stampede scene: the head of one of the motionless animals Plate 4 Head of a deer (24'5 by 22'5 centimetres).

It is hardly surprising that it was the more accomplished and presumably sought-after products of, for example, the Schwarzenbach workshop or Diirkheim goldmiths which reached the widest distribution. The distribution of other specialized Celtic products, such as early La Tene swords with clover-leaf terminals to their scabbards (Osterhaus DA 287</page><page sequence="29">288 J. . S.

Bartlett after (I) Dehn and (2) Joachim I969: abb. 3 and list 2), or the somewhat later Braubacher Schalen and related Stempel- keramik (Dehn 1951 a, Schwappach, 1969 a, b), whose motifs offer many points of similarity with those used by our specialist metal-engravers, also stretches west to the Marne, east to Bohemia and beyond, and south to such Celtic colonial and trading outposts as Diirrnberg and into the border land, cultural and artistic, of the Ticino. The present brief sketch has not in the main been concerned with the non-Celtic sources of any of the individual motifs contained in the proposed style groups. It should, however, be reiter- ated here that when one brings into view the range and distribution in the early La Tene period of Greek pottery (Reim 1968), Etruscan imports (Schaaff 1969: i95ff.) and the so-called 'Rhenish' bronze situla whose point of origin appears to be the Ticino (Drie- haus I966, Schwappach I969a: 25a and abb. 20), it would seem to be unnecessary to follow certain 'orientalizing' motifs in Fiirstengrdber metal-work east into the world of Achaemenian and Scythian art (Sandars 1971). We have already mentioned the Hall- statt grave 994 sword scabbard - to the present writer, the work of a Celtic craftsman combining native detailing with elements borrowed from the south in the manner of the contemporary situla artists. One may well wonder where in fact the scabbard was en- graved; perhaps not in the waning Hallstatt settlement, but rather at Diirrnberg, the major settlement centre amongst the Ostgruppe Fiirstengrdber. One final class of objects which may point to Italy as the direct source of not only at least the majority of the 'classicizing' but 'orientalizing' elements in early La Tene art is what has been termed the 'Ticino' class of several open-work belt-plaques, well- dated by association to the earlier fourth century B.C. (Megaw I97ib) (fig. 19). Unlike the larger and related group of simple palmette or clover-leaf open-work mounts whose distribution extends from the Marne to early Celtic graves in northern Italy, the Ticino belt-plaques with their orientalizing 'master' (rather than 'mistress') 'of the wild beasts', backward-looking griffons and other birds and animals, must have a fair claim to being the only truly local stylistic group of the first Celts to settle on the south side of the Alps. One of the Ticino plaques (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 363, Megaw I97oa: no. 98), as well as two of the simpler 'Marnian' form, was found at Este (Frey I968: taf. 31: 31, 33), centre of the earliest situla style and close to the classical entrepots of Spina and Adria.

Megaw Ticino plaque, found also with 'Marnian' forms, comes from Enserune (Jacobsthal 1944: no. 362; Megaw I97Ib: fig. 3d) to the west of Massalia, that key Greek colony for contact with the Celtic hinterland. Here, in this single distribution, is surely a vital clue to the significance of Italo-Celtic trade and culture-contact in the elucidation of the development of style and style groupings in early La Tene art.

Style and style groupings in continental early La Tene art Fine metal-work of La Tene Ia/Ai-2 date, mainly associated with early Fiirstengraber, is examined in an attempt to establish individual 'schools' or workshop traditions, particular emphasis being placed on non-representational motifs of ultimately classical origin. Two general groups of gold-work are postulated, and consideration is given to related objects exhibiting complex engraved designs. A final section discusses the possible conclusions to be drawn from the distributions of individual classes of objects. Although this paper is not strictly concerned with the non-Celtic artistic origins of individual styles and motifs, the importance of Italy is emphasized.</page></plain_text>
