<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE PUNISHMENT AND RECONCILIATION J. Brenton Stearns ABSTRACT On the basis of a distinction between suffering and punishment, I maintain that divine punishment is suffering understood against the backdrop of an ultimate or divine morality. Suffering can in some cases be a retributively just desert even where there is an obvious absence of distributive justice. After reconcilia- tion with God the suffering may continue unabated, but the suffering loses its status as punishment. An innocent or forgiven person cannot be punished no matter how much s/he is made to suffer. Divine punishment is an ultimate moral concept, an interpretation placed on suffering by a person of morally good will. Although the picturesque descriptions of hell in sacred literature, Dante's Inferno, and the sermons of Jonathan Edwards have lost much of their sting, punishment remains a fundamental moral and theological idea. True, we have good reason to hesitate about the appropriateness of drawing analo- gies from the enforcement of the law of the state to moral and theological contexts. We can readily see the imperfections of legal punishment as a method of crime prevention, retribution, or artificial redistribution of bene- fits and burdens. We note the element of vengeance and the loss of respect for persons that surround punishment as a social institution, and we find ourselves cautious at the point of transferring these imperfections to the cos- mos at large. However, a moral insistence on punishment remains, and not so much as something for other people to go through as a way of our under- standing the seriousness of our own guilt. Quite possibly a care for distribu- tive justice does not weigh heavily upon us and we are selfless enough not to worry about the fact that other people are both guiltier and happier than we are. Nevertheless there remains the moral interpretation that we make on our own happinesses and sufferings that hints at an understanding of pun- ishment that is morally more fundamental than anything a state or other so- cial group could impose. We think of Robinson Crusoe's guilt-ridden dreams while alone on his tropical island. God had cast him on the island, he be- lieved, in punishment for disobeying his father and living apart from God. That kind of experience remains psychologically and morally compelling, even after we allow for differences between Robinson Crusoe and ourselves in moral and theological theory. 118</page><page sequence="2">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 1 1 9 My aim in this essay is to set the concept of divine punishment loose from its ancient moorings in theologically based ethical theory, predestination, and anthropomorphic views of God. Instead, I will assume human free will, at least relative to divine constraints, and a rational moral autonomy of a Kantian type. In addition I will use two other ideas that are current, though not universally accepted, in contemporary philosophical writings on punish- ment. The first is that our understanding of ourselves as being justly punished for our wrongdoings is a fundamentally moral kind of self-understanding. The state should not try to and in fact cannot deprive us of that self- understanding through wholly rehabilitative techniques which treat the incar- cerated criminal as.a hospitalized sick person. The second is that the concept of having done something wrong is analytically involved in the concept of being punished, that logically there can be no punishment without wrongdo- ing. I will also propose a third and more controversial principle which should get the heads of ethical non-naturalists nodding in agreement: pun- ishment (morally speaking) is not a natural property of any state of affairs. What is or is not a punishment from a moral point of view cannot be read off from a description of the natural features of a situation. I believe that if these principles are taken seriously, the idea of divine punishment can be rein- stated in such a way that it helps to interpret our deep moral convictions and does not at all give us that feeling of moral repulsion some critics find in it. Charles Hartshorne (1967:108) has long insisted that God is not to be thought of as a cosmic policeman with statutes, sanctions, and powers of co- ercive enforcement. He writes that punishment may be imposed by human magistrates as a stopgap measure, providing it works, and it does not seem to work very well on the whole. Ultimately, however, punishment is inappro- priate as a response to moral evil. The religious person acts out of love of God and neighbor. If one acts to avoid punishment, one's actions are ulti- mately prudential. God wants us to love him for his own sake, not to avoid hell. Divine punishment has no place, because it seems to reduce morality to prudence and to preclude a loving relationship with God and the cosmos. I accept that. However, we must in addition deal with our moral interest in just retribution and distribution. Just because getting rewards and avoid- ing punishments has no place in moral motivation, we must not conclude that questions of justice are ultimately to be ignored. Philosophical justifica- tions of punishment stand as testimony to the moral ambiguities surround- ing punishment. There are times when suffering has the significance of ret- ribution. Those who oppose hedonism sometimes write that pain can be an intrinsic good when it is had by a person who deserves it and for whom it is a stage in the process of repentance and reconciliation. Meanwhile in Christian theology, the idea of punishment is deeply rooted, albeit often obscure and implicit. It is part of the grand cosmic drama of redemption in which there is a movement from sin to guilt, and then from</page><page sequence="3">120 The Journal of Religious Ethics guilt to redemption. The route from guilt to redemption takes very seriously suffering and punishment. Substitutionary theories of atonement where Christ is the guilty person's substitute in punishment are admittedly psycho- logically gripping in that the sinner himself insists on punishment as the re- deeming price of sin. Significantly the need for such punishment is met in the object of his worship. The repentant sinner often demands punishment so that he can live with himself. We do not need Christian theology to tell us that this is a dominant theme in the human imagination. Much great litera- ture is built around the need for atonement as an answer to wrongdoing and the place of punishment in that atonement. We think of Oedipus Rex, the Oresteia Trilogy, and the Scarlet Letter, just for example. As for the psychology of guilt, it may not be as wasting of human energies as some Freudians have told us. Certainly a distinction between authentic and inauthentic guilt is needed. Where guilt is inauthentic, as when guilt is confused with embarrassment, or where feelings of guilt are caused by viola- tions of nonmoral prohibitions enforced by parents, teachers, or religious groups, the feeling rather than the fact of guilt stands in our way. Some- times, as through psychoanalysis, the feeling of guilt can be removed by ex- posing its causes. Authentic guilt, on the other hand, is a moral response to oneself and one's conduct. It is not itself a sickness or disability, and psycho- analysis is not its cure. Authentic guilt is what moral and theological theories of redemption and atonement speak about. For the person of good will, guilt must be every bit as significant as the morality relative to which guilt is understood. Even granting, however, the appropriateness of feelings of guilt under some circumstances and the psychological aptness of the Christian doctrines of atonement for dealing effectively with authentic guilt, we are still not quite at the point of making sense of the concept of divine punishment. There are indeed understandings of atonement within Christian tradition where punishment plays no part at all. The moral influence theories portray Jesus as the moral prophet and teacher who attracts us to the life in confor- mity to God's will. The important thing is not that we be punished for what we have done in the past but that we be changed. Jesus saves us from punish- ment not by substituting himself for the sinner as a recipient of God's wrath but by inspiring sinners to change their ways. That fits in well with the view that punishment is pointless except as a deterrent imposed by magistrates in order to keep the peace. The moral influence theories insist that punishment be kept a civil and judicial concept with no further moral or theological sig- nificance. Although I do not want to carry a brief for any particular Chris- tian atonement theory, I do want to maintain against the moral influence theories that the concept of punishment is important beyond the realm of the magistrate's sanctions. Marjorie Grene in her work on Heidegger (1957:17-41) talks about the hu-</page><page sequence="4">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 1 2 1 man being responding to conscience and knowing itself as guilty. The human being emerges in its authenticity in the awareness of guilt. To remove guilt entirely from our condition would be to relax the tension which is our hu- man being. There is an "ought" never achieved, and guilt is our moral response to that deficiency. I agree with Grene and go on to maintain that punishment lies in an interpretation the agent places upon the suffering that comes as a causal consequence of the actions and character traits in virtue of which he is guilty. That is the way the moral agent understands his life in the world. Punishment is a self-imposed category of thought insisted upon by the autonomous, rational, self-legislating person. To be deprived of the con- cept of punishment by a deterministic psychology or sociology is to be de- prived of what is peculiar to our humanity. That is my reason for thinking the concept of punishment has a place beyond the judicial sphere. Insofar as morality is regarded as ultimate in its demands, certain sufferings must be regarded as punishments in the same ultimate sense. It is at this point that the concept of divine punishment takes root. I shall now attempt to define "punishment" generically and then to take note of the distinctive features of punishment relative to an ultimate or di- vine morality. I hope to arrive finally at a theoretical understanding of what divine punishment is. My approach will be to differentiate punishment as seen from a moral perspective from punishment as understood from a social-political perspective. My assumption is that God, the object of wor- ship, is either the source and meaning of the moral laws or possibly identical with the moral laws. Whatever qualifies as "divine" punishment must be un- derstood as punishment that is appropriate and/or required by the ultimate standards of conduct and justice. Divine punishment is suffering that would be understood as punishment by a perfect and omniscient being should such a being exist. In general a punishment must be some kind of pain, suffering, or disutil- ity. The suffering must come as a consequence of wrongdoing, and the wrongdoer must be its victim. Punishment conceptually is always relative to some offense. For the person who does not believe he has done an illegal act, that person's imprisonment for allegedly breaking the law will be considered unjustly imposed suffering, but not punishment. He will understand that suffering as a martyrdom or misfortune. For the person who believes he acted unfreely, under physical or psychological compulsion, that person's imprisonment will have the character of a pain accompanying a sickness, ac- cident, or physical disability. The civilly disobedient person usually understands himself to have broken the legally valid, though immoral, laws of a legitimate sovereign. He understands his imprisonment or fine as pun- ishment, even just punishment perhaps, in a civil sense. Morally speaking, though, his act was not a wrongdoing in his judgment, and therefore the suf- fering that comes as the act's consequence is not seen as punishment in any</page><page sequence="5">122 The Journal of Religious Ethics moral sense. The lesson we learn from this is that punishment in a moral context is not a natural property of an event, state of affairs, mental state, or suffering. Punishment can be understood at various levels, notably civil and moral, but it is a concept that is rooted in some kind of violation of a law, standard, or norm of conduct. T. S. Champlin (1976:85-87) disputes the doctrine I have expressed here, that you cannot punish an innocent person no matter how much you make that person suffer. Admitting that it is a currently widely accepted view, he maintains to the contrary that one can be punished for allegedly doing some- thing wrong even when one is in fact innocent. He would likely say that try- ing to secure the doctrine by definition as I have attempted is fruitless, be- cause the doctrine is then divorced from ordinary language and the ordinary problems of life. I do not, however, believe that the definitional entailment of guilt by pun- ishment raises havoc with ordinary language distinctions. All the problems of ordinary life remain, because an instance of inflicted suffering is very much a matter of moral concern whether or not it is a punishment. The point I want to make is that punishment and guilt are epistemologically linked concepts. Believing that a punishment occurred is no more epistemologically secure than believing the suffering person is guilty. As there are alleged of- fenses, there are also alleged punishments. We do commonly speak of cases where a person is punished for something he did not do. However, someone believed he did it, and perhaps with good reason. Good reasons for thinking that a suffering is a punishment are dependent on the good reasons for thinking that a wrongdoing has occurred. Putting a person in prison does not in itself constitute a punishment even in ordinary speech. A distinction is quite commonly made between punishment and preventive detention. The conceptual dependence of punishment on guilt is crucial to understanding how two people may be suffering equally and yet one is being punished and the other is not. And that, in turn, is theologically interesting in that it sheds light on one traditional stumbling block to the concept of divine punishment and reward: that it rains on the just and unjust alike. When we move from punishment in general and the legal paradigms of punishment into the sphere of morality, we find there are some features of state punishment which are not applicable. First, state punishment is pur- posely inflicted by some authorized person or correctional institution at the demand of a civil judge or judicial body. Some theologies recognize suffer- ings specially inflicted by authorities in order to make the universe just and equitable. These are generally thought to be reserved for the afterlife and the special conditions of punishment imposed there through the fires of hell, for example. Yes, an afterlife seems theoretically possible, and I should think that if it occurs it might well involve suffering. But is it conceivable that God</page><page sequence="6">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 123 would purposely inflict suffering himself in an afterlife or authorize some- one else (the Devil) to do it for him? I have already commented that moral virtue must be grounded in a mo- tive higher than prudence. There remains the possibility, though, that God might punish for the sake of ultimate justice, even granting that prudence is not adequate as a moral motivation. One may obey one's parents out of re- spect for the moral precepts the parents make clear, even though one knows that he will be punished if he does not obey. There is a strain of this even in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. One is to obey the moral law out of re- spect for the law. Nevertheless the moral faith is that justice will ultimately prevail, and the virtuous will ultimately be happy. In my view Hartshorne is right on this question. With any punishment that can be rightly called divine, the suffering must be appropriate. I will be arguing that ultimate distributive justice is not appropriate as an article of moral faith or hope. The point of morality is that it is binding regardless of what the moral agent may expect to get out of it. The moral way of life is the highest way of life, and nothing added to it externally in the way of benefits can elevate its importance. Even if you differ with me on this, however, there is a further argument against using the policeman and judicial system model in theology. The con- cept of God's punishing in an afterlife or authorizing a devil to do it requires that the punishment be done justly. After all, the only reason for introducing this idea is to achieve the ideal justice that is missing from human affairs. Any punishment done by God is by definition just. But could punishment in- flicted in an afterlife possibly be just? Marilyn McCord Adams (1975) main- tains that eternal suffering in hell could not be just even in retributive terms, since no finite being can sin as badly as all that. Yes, but we can go on to say that no punishment inflicted in an afterlife could, even for finite periods of time, be just. One condition of just punishment imposed by authorities is that the rules the violation of which will bring punishment be announced in advance, as well as the character and duration of the punishment involved. Divine punishment in an afterlife would be in response to the infraction of rules insufficiently promulgated. Our understanding of moral rules is pri- marily intuitive, not based on clear promulgation. Even where we are sure we have broken a divine moral law - and those cases are rare- we are not sure what kind of violation brings what kind of punishment. Just punish- ment by an authority in an afterlife is something short of a conceptual absur- dity. We might be able to think up circumstances under which the rules and schedule of punishments are reliably revealed. However, given the current obscurity in which all that rests, no suffering consciously inflicted upon peo- ple in an afterlife could be God's doing. There may yet be divine punishment after death in the form of undergoing the continued painful consequences of</page><page sequence="7">124 The Journal of Religious Ethics wrongdoings, but the legal model of rational infliction of suffering by a con- scious, purposive, and just agent must be dropped. As far as this life is con- cerned, the model fares even worse. Not only are the rules and schedule of punishments obscure, but there is no evidence that a God worthy of worship or an authorized agent of his is engaged in a distribution of just punish- ments. Indeed, the manifest falsity of this idea is one of the prime motives for belief in the doctrine of the afterlife. The idea that God's goodness and truth must be clearly manifest in order that divinely inflicted suffering be just punishment is emphasized by Paul in his letter to the Romans: For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wick- edness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things he had made. So they are without excuse; for although they know God they did not know him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened. (Romans 1:18-21, Revised Standard Version) In this favorite text of those who wish to show that natural theology has bib- lical support, we understand that God can justly punish only the person who is without excuse, and justifiable ignorance of God is an excuse. So God has taken steps to see that all human beings, whether recipients of Christian rev- elation or not, have the knowledge of him prerequisite to just punishment. Perhaps here we can see why it is that contemporary theologies of revela- tion are more ambiguous on the question of divinely inflicted sufferings than was the natural religion of the rationalistic and enlightenment periods. In the classic statement of natural religion by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, di- vine punishment was given a prominent place. However, recent revealed the- ologies recognize a general obscurity with respect to God's being, nature, and requirements that can be dispelled only by revelation received by grace. If that is granted, then it seems that God can inflict suffering justly only on those whom he has chosen as recipients of his grace - presumably those who are least likely to need it or warrant it. Whatever our verdict on natural theology, Paul was wrong to think that God's being and nature are suffi- ciently manifest in the world to justify divinely inflicted sufferings in this life or any future life. The religious person still requires a theological interpreta- tion of suffering, but I do not believe he can hope for understanding through the idea that some or all suffering is divinely inflicted for the purpose of punishment. Another feature of judicial state punishment with doubtful application to the moral sphere is the insistence that the suffering that ensues upon convic- tion of a rule infraction come to the guilty person and to the guilty person</page><page sequence="8">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 125 alone. With regard to most of the aims of state punishment, there is prime importance in reserving the suffering for the guilty only. Punishment will not deter from crime if the innocent people suffer as well as the guilty and in the same way. Furthermore, if retribution is to be the justifying reason, bringing suffering to the innocent could not be defended. In addition, pun- ishment would not serve the function of rectifying unjust distributions if the innocent suffered as well as the guilty. Therefore, in state punishment elabo- rate precautions are taken to see that only the guilty suffer in the prescribed ways. In the moral sphere there is no evidence that the suffering comes to the guilty and the guilty alone. The traditional answers of the theodicies are ba- sically right on this point. The exciting thing about moral virtue is that one knows it has little or nothing to do with the distributions of sufferings. Since we can find no application for the idea of a God consciously inflicting pun- ishments in accord with some grand purpose, we must expect as a corollary that distributions of sufferings relative to moral virtue will be haphazard. That is indeed what we find. It would be surprising if it were otherwise. The morally virtuous person does his duty because it is his duty. Here finally we come to that part of life where there is intrinsic importance to what we do. We are not virtuous to avoid suffering. However, when suffering is the con- sequence of moral lapses, there is the moral insistence on the part of the per- son who acted wrongly to see that suffering as punishment from a moral point of view. Divine punishment is all of that and nothing more. That it does not have all the features of state punishment is what we should expect from the disparities between the kingdoms of the world and the moral com- monwealth. Because of the special character of morality as opposed to prudence, di- vine punishment cannot in the end serve the interests of distributive justice. If sufferings are adventitious with respect to guilt, and if there can be no guarantee that sufferings come only to morally guilty persons, we must, as a matter of principle, abandon hope for ultimate distributive justice in this life and the next. Contrary to Kant, we cannot even hold just distribution as an article of faith or hope. Our interest in just distribution is in the end frustrated, but at the same time we see the moral and theological necessity for that frustration. Further- more, the inappropriateness of a demand for distributive justice relative to moral merit does not mean that the concept of just retribution for moral lapses must also be abandoned. The religious person may still understand his own sufferings and happinesses in the light of his own moral merit and his own relation to the source and end of the moral life. Suffering may still be understood as retributively just even in the absence of just distribution. An explicit reply is needed to those who think (1) that the concept of divine punishment takes its meaning from the context of divinely imposed</page><page sequence="9">126 The Journal of Religious Ethics suffering and (2) that it has no meaning divorced from that context. A. C. Ewing (1929:219) writes: "Punishment means properly pain inflicted by an external agent as a mark of disapproval for wrong done. ..." However, he goes on to remark that this concept has very little to do with morality, and that there is a wider sense of punishment which is not the same as the nar- rower sense. Ewing speaks of a psychological process by which people come to see the wrong they have done and are reformed. In the wider sense, the suffering that constitutes punishment need not be inflicted by an external agent. Usually these natural punishments are more severe or less severe, than would be inflicted by an external agent interested in just retribution. They also differ from punishments inflicted by an external agent in that they do not have the function of teaching right conduct. It is not, after all, the suf- fering that follows the act that makes the act wrong. Natural punishment is rather a way of interpreting some instances of suffering from a moral point of view, where the moral point of view is brought to, rather than derived from, the suffering. Understanding the suffering as punishment and ac- knowledging it as such is tantamount to repentance and setting one's life on the right path. Natural punishment may properly be regarded as divine by the religious person when the standards of value in terms of which the pun- ishment is understood have their being in God. Next I want to reflect on the place of punishment in redemption as seen from a religious perspective. The influential Scottish theologian, Donald Baillie (1948:167), in his book on Christology identifies the problem of suf- fering undergone by forgiven people. According to Baillie certain sufferings undergone by the sinner are seen rightly as divine punishment for that per- son's sins. The conditions of punishment I have outlined are fulfilled. There is guilt and suffering that comes as a consequence of the sinful actions of the guilty person. The guilt is authentic, a violation of ultimate standards of conduct. However the situation for the guilty person is far from hopeless, as the Christian religion is thought to provide an answer for specifically this type of problem. Let us neglect Baillie's interpretation of the kind of answer Christianity brings to guilt and simply recognize that in some way Christ is thought to bring redemption or atonement. The problem is that in many cases after the sin is forgiven and the guilt removed, the suffering continues unabated. In fact, it does not seem to matter, insofar as the suffering is con- cerned, whether or not the guilt is removed. Baillie admits that we have the option here to say that the punishment continues after forgiveness, that forgiveness has nothing to do with the remission of punishment. But God is said to cancel the guilt and even forget it. So it is hard to see under those circumstances how the punishment could continue. The suffering prior to forgiveness has just the same properties then as it does after forgiveness. How then can it be punishment before forgiveness and not punishment afterwards?</page><page sequence="10">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 127 An additional problem that Baillie does not raise is that the suffering in question which is caused by the guilty act has all the qualities it has indepen- dently of whether the act which caused it is sinful. Presumably the suffering following the act is not what makes the act wrong, for that principle would pronounce martyrdom immoral. So the suffering does not come in conse- quence of the sinfulness of the act, but rather of the natural properties of the act which, at least for ethical non-naturalists, do not entail the act's sin- fulness. I will now outline some of the possible solutions to the problem Baillie raises. A) Thomas Aquinas (1947:977) maintains that the debt of punishment remains when sin is removed. The state of sin can be removed if human be- ings accept divine justice and unite themselves to God by his will and volun- tarily take upon themselves the punishment God inflicts. Thomas seems to mean that one necessary step to take in being forgiven is to accept the suffer- ing one undergoes as divine punishment for the sin. By doing so the soul is healed, but more suffering may still be needed to heal the other faculties, to restore equality in human affairs, to remove the scandal brought about to others, and to edify others. The suffering that comes after the stain of sin is forgiven or removed is not inflicted merely for the sake of utility to cure the offender and to edify the populace, but it carries with it the retributive fea- tures of punishment as well. Perhaps we could say that although the stain of sin is removed and the offender is brought in right relation with God, his moral guilt remains and requires continuing retribution. B) There is divine punishment but no divine forgiveness. The conse- quences of our guilty acts follow us irrevocably. A person reaps what he sows. The Law of Karma in Hindu religious theory expresses this view. C) There is forgiveness, and the suffering that follows forgiveness cannot be thought of as punishment. Since the suffering prior to forgiveness has the same natural properties, it cannot be punishment either. God holds people guilty and forgives the penitent, but no sufferings are punishments. D) One could deny the assumptions one needs to speak of divine punish- ment. There are no ultimate moral demands. Short of the restrictions of positive law, everything is permitted. Or, there are moral rules, but the suf- ferings that come from violations of them are not punishments. E) There is a change in one's response to suffering after he believes he is in right relation with God, but the change is purely psychological. Nothing objective has happened. The sinner thinks at one time he is being punished and at another time he is not. The difference is in one's attitude toward one's own sufferings and in that alone. F) The best solution to the problem is that of Donald Baillie. After rec- onciliation with God, he says (1948:168), "the sufferings are the same and yet different." He writes that the punishment lies in the alienation from God,</page><page sequence="11">128 The Journal of Religious Ethics not in the sufferings. I would put it differently. I would say that the suffer- ings and the alienation from God (ultimate guilt) are both necessary condi- tions of divine punishment. When the alienation is removed, one of the necessary conditions is gone, and the suffering that remains is not punish- ment but rather, as Baillie puts it, "a divine discipline." Baillie's position rec- ognizes that sin against God is not an irrevocable state for the worshipper. He will oscillate in his loyalties, but a return to his highest loves is always possible. The position recognizes too that the relation of moral guilt to suf- fering is adventitious. Not only can the relation with God be mended, but all the suffering retribution requires may be finished before the actual suffering ends. Furthermore, Baillie deals with guilt, punishment, and reconciliation realistically, not simply psychologically. The suffering that remains after rec- onciliation is the same and yet different. The difference does not lie simply in the mind of the sufferer. The difference lies significantly in the moral in- tentions and good will of the person, and that is not simply a matter of atti- tude toward suffering. Yes, there is a paradox of the suffering's being the same and yet different. But the paradox is resolved when we see that, al- though suffering is a necessary feature of punishment, no suffering can be punishment unless further conditions are fulfilled. Those further conditions are moral in character and cannot be read off by logic from a description of the deed and its circumstances. Donald Baillie's interpretation of divine punishment has positive analo- gies to the paradigm case, state punishment, as well as to punishment in- flicted by parents, schools, and social organizations. Suffering alone is not sufficient for punishment. To suffering must be added alienation from the state in the form of judicial sentence for violating the norms of action im- posed by the state. Take away the judicial sentence and the attendant aliena- tion from social life and no suffering is considered punishment. Paying taxes may be painful, but it is not punishment. Being conscripted for military ser- vice may bring suffering, but it is not punishment. Even sufferings that are causal consequents of wrongdoings are not necessarily punishments, as when the families of guilty, convicted persons suffer from the imprisonment of their loved ones. These analogies strengthen Baillie's case for the view that when alienation from God ceases, the sufferings cease to be punishments, even though no changes take place in the suffering. Finally, I will venture a few comments on the idea of substitutionary suf- fering that is found in some Christian atonement theories. The charge is sometimes made that it is unjust for any person, including Jesus, to be pun- ished for the offences of another. In fact, if my definition of punishment is accepted, suffering inflicted upon innocent persons is not punishment at all. I think that what is needed to make sense of substitutionary theories is belief in some kind of mystical participation in Christ as the representative human</page><page sequence="12">Divine Punishment and Reconciliation 129 being. Insofar as one person is thought to stand for all people symbolically, the sufferings undergone by that one person are symbolically the sufferings of all. Furthermore, in this case they are thought to be the sufferings of God himself. The sufferings that justice requires have their symbolic satisfaction to emphasize that the sins were serious business and that mercy is fully com- patible with justice. If the party sinned against is willing to accept upon him- self the sufferings that come as a consequence of the sins of others without throwing them back upon the sinner, as usually happens in human affairs, the chain of retributions and recriminations is ended and peace is restored. This fulfills the requirements of justice, because the sinner, in restored good will, participates symbolically in the suffering and final vindication of the representative human being. There is something a bit similar in the final play of Aeschylus's Oresteia where the furies of vengeance are scattered by Athena's court of justice. But there one wonders whether a civil judicial sys- tem, even with a goddess in charge, can solve the problems of human fail- ures that a morally prophetic monotheism carries in its train. The difficulty with substitutionary atonement theories within Christian- ity is that they take an idea which has application in the context of a corpo- rate model of human nature where there is participation of all believers in one common life symbolized by a representative man, and then they set it loose from its proper context. Under the corporate model, the sufferings of one are understood as the sufferings of all, and where very high value is put on the corporate life, the sufferings are those of God himself. Trouble comes when this idea falls into the hands of individualistically inclined Christian evangelicals who are interested in personal salvation. Then the sufferings of one are chalked up on the score card of another. In terms of individualistic justice, that is unfair to the sufferer, demoralizing to the person suffered in behalf of, and at worst a mere transaction in a cosmic record book of moral credits and debits. My verdict is that the substitutionary atonement idea when understood in its proper context articulates in a struggling and inadequate way something that needs to be said in addition to the "do better next time" approach of the moral influence theories. As I have argued through this paper, guilt becomes a significant and even crucial matter when viewed from the standpoint of an ethical monotheism. Even the courts of the land cannot deal with it ade- quately, as the ethical commonwealth is distinct from all civil common- wealths. In the ethical commonwealth, moral guilt is inevitable. Guilt carries with it the concept of being deserving of suffering, and the suffering that comes in the train of guilt-making acts is properly regarded as punishment from the moral point of view. The problem of dealing with moral guilt with- out despair and defeat has been and continues to be one of the chief theoreti- cal and practical problems for any morally prophetic religion.</page><page sequence="13">1 30 The Journal of Religious Ethics REFERENCES Adams, Marilyn McCord 1975 "Hell and the God of justice."
