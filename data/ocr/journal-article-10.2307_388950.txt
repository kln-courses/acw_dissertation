<plain_text><page sequence="1">straightforward and more conventional narrative which conveys Milie's history in the central section of the second part. Etcherelli is the most affecting in her responsiveness to nature, from which she borrows the title and the image for Milie's rebirth-Milie, an arbre voyageur who moves from place to place, from man to man, unable to put down roots-Milie, herself a proletarian Mother Nature, harboring all sorts of strange birds until they gaih enough strength to fly away. The medlar tree which graces Milie's yard becomes a double on which to project her frustrations and fears. Living in an anthropomorphic world, she is nonetheless aware of being caught up in a pathetic fallacy; "la vraie vie" ultimately exists in dirty, crowded Belleville and the twentieth arrondissement. Her return to her working-class roots provokes the triumphant and terrestrial metaphor with which Etcherelli closes the novel: "Germination/la fin d'Hiver approche/Terre figee tu vas craquer.. . " (p. 339). To read this novel well, we should take a hint from nature's cycle and go back to the beginning which will now make sense. Even so, and despite Etcherelli's obvious pleasure in the earth, her delicate characters remain forever disembodied and cerebral. University of Wisconsin, Madison Judith G. Miller FAYE, JEAN PIERRE. Verres. Paris: Seghers/Laffont, 1977. Pp. 199. 49 F. It would be misplaced to attempt to measure the relative degree of Jean Pierre Faye's attachment to the shifting, for him symbiotically related realms of poetry, fiction and theatre, not to mention those of politics and openly discursive or expository articulation. For many years now Faye's work has shown itself to be operating, with brilliant and combative originality, at that essential and yet elusive point where not only does the world leave its "impression" upon and through language, but language itself "bites into" the world, bares its dangerous, yet beautiful trenchancy, its vital, yet vulnerable power of interaction and change. If Faye continually "returns" to poetry-Fleuve renverse appeared in 1960, followed by Couleurs pliees in 1965 and now this collation into "un ensemble qui se deploie" of previously written pieces dating back some ten years-it is perhaps because it is there that the submersion in language, the sense of the mutually beneficial imbrication and interference of reality and language, the provocation and subversiveness, though also the sheer exhilaration, of this reciprocal movement may be most completely, most poignantly experienced. But poetry is at best a privileged locus and mode of expression and Faye's other writings demonstrate very clearly that it is all of language, that "non-place that lights up all places," that preoccupies him, which he seeks to explore and deploy, forcing it to manifest its revolutionary, liberating "black power" in the face of its all too well-known capacity to subjugate in a denial of such potential. As with the earlier Couleurs pliees it is impossible to opt in our reading of Verres for a definitively explanatory perspective, and yet, as Xavier Delcourt (cf. La Quinzaine Litteraire, 207 [1975], 11-12) has so rightly pointed out, Faye's writing, despite its unrelatable, untellable quality, is remarkable in the richness of its weave and texture. Certainly, in the midst of its illisibilite, Faye's text flashes intermittent half-messages about itself, its own functioning, and its relation to the concrete world "outside," thus allowing fragments of elliptic, untied, yet direct, immediate sense to protrude evocatively. Certainly Faye's poetry offers the bare traces of a self-history (of poet and text), whilst, simultaneously, its smooth surface prises off our grip, refuses the firm purchase we cannot but help anticipate. But Faye is not concerned to convey a simple, single, anodyne message. What he thrusts upon us is the swirling and swarming of language, its constantly shifting masses rather than a congealed structure- which is precisely what Robbe-Grillet found disconcerting in Faye's writing, much to the latter's pleasure (cf. Change, 24). Movement, change, becoming, these are the principles of Faye's articulation. The ceaseless, restless activity which is there in the world is thus reflected, diffracted rather, in the vigorous, tumbling, pulsional creativity of (his) language, which in turn echoes -both speaking of and demonstrating-the endlessly variable, transform- able-transforming "exchange of men, manifest or secret, and its weaves" (cf. Change, 24). This 793 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">794 FRENCH REVIEW continual crisscrossing and expanding of levels of discourse in themselves highly volatile creates within Faye's work and the present volume in particular a strong prismatic effect. Light is allowed to pass through the texts from numerous angles and sides in an enriching, deepening process that mimes the interfacing of all phenomena, of all perspectives placed upon the world. Moreover, the probable "difficulty" of Faye's chosen mode of articulation should not be neglected, for his writing is riddled through with the tensions of a turbulence within, a corporeal expenditure not unreminiscent at times of a poet such as Bernard Noel. Nor should we overlook the perspective of a certain nothingness or lowliness that informs language and therefore, paradoxically, tends to hollow out Faye's own richly creative activity. It is a perspective that does not deny the optic of creativity, but it functions as a corrective, a complementary force, and thus allows Faye's work-as again with Noel's, though other contemporary poets spring to mind-to promote within itself a profound sensation of the struggle between form and void in language, in our making and changing of the world. Dalhousie University Michael Bishop FRANK, JEAN-MICHEL. Dieu protege les roses! Paris: Gallimard, 1977. Pp. 95. Jean-Michel Frank's fifth volume of poetry expresses a wonderfully dense imagery which, while entirely his own, evokes Mallarm6's art at its best. He identifies the sense of his newest volume by calling it "ce petit livre d'oraison," and suggests that we read it "pour la rose qui meurt au-dessus de la fange dans le d6lai superbe d'un oiseau." For Frank poetry is prayer, and he prays to God that the fragile rose, instrument and symbol of glory, be preserved from those insensitive beings who would tread on it in their unquiet passage in this world. Logically, the theme of the rose is repeated in this collection, often in the form of uersets. Elsewhere, however, he achieves in longer prose poems, homilies in fact, a clarification of his symbolism and an understanding of a multi-faceted personal philosophy. Man (or mankind), for example, becomes the rose. Yet the rose alone does not always reign in what the poet terms a "republique de fleurs." The collection is also a gathering of a single summer's meditations, of unusual observations of the human condition, and especially of highly hermetic pieces that defy hasty analysis. If he honors other poets in a serious vein ("A Goethe"), he turns with humor to assert that "les gens ne savent manger que dans les quartiers vieux des villes. / C'est un acte culturel." What stands as the collection's unity, beyond the symbolic rose, is Christianity, to which he constantly refers with a deft handling of the imagery of nature. Although rich in metaphors, Frank's language strikes one at first as being very simple; only with rereading can one plunge toward the central issues and ultimately to his personal concept of Christianity. Frank also continues, like Mallarme, a tendency toward preciocity. His poem "L'Ordre de la nuit," for example, is a complex study of the poem's refrain: "Je hais la rue qui derange / L'ordre de la nuit." Equally characteristic of the volume is the following passage: "Homme voici la rose / Je suis ne dans un mois douloureux / Oii les poisons latents / Trouvent l'epine sous la chair." Drawn from the volume's key poem, the quotation puts into relief the relationship of man and God, for the "I" has little bearing save as a preliminary step toward the understanding of mankind. Frank's first four volumes are also devoted to religious themes: Journal d'un autre (doubt), Toute La Nuitj'ecoute (hope), Ma Fenetre sur la folie (faith), and Les Poetes entre eux (charity). The art of this latest volume strikes this reviewer, who also wrote of Ma Fen6tre sur la folie, as more mature, certainly more meticulous with respect to imagery. While the former volume seems bathed in classic "litterature," Dieu protege les roses!, while entirely disciplined, is far more spontaneous. University of Massachusetts, Amherst Robert B.
