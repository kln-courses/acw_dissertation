<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics: Assembly and Decoration of Improvised Vehicles in Greece during and after World War II Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou This paper examines the Car Culture developed in Greece by mechanics who trained empirically by tinkering with vehicles during and after World War II. It aims to depict the cultural biography of industrial products in interaction with their users' role outside the production process. More specifically, it describes prac tices such as the vehicles' assembly from the spare parts of military vehicles during World War II and the early post-war years, the customised modifications from the late 1950s to the present and the decoration of vehicles between the 1950s and 1970s. These practices are examined in relation with the change in their cultural significance and purpose. Drawing on the hermeneutic tool of'interpretative flex ibility' this paper discusses whether flexibility in the use and signification of automobiles is a specific phase in a standardised procedure or whether it follows different paths in time and in different social groups. INTRODUCTION Alexandras Topaloglou is a retired Greek mechanic who worked in Greek owned and Nazi-occupied factories and in his own repair shop from the 1940s to the 1960s. He tells his story: During the Nazi occupation, I was in my teens. One day when my older brother and I were in a village to trade soap for food, we saw a semi destroyed Anzani motorcycle in a yard. It had been abandoned by the Italian army, and its current owners were Greek villagers who used its Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou is a Ph.D. candidate at the National Technical University of Athens.

When we told them we wanted to buy this motorcycle, they replied that they would sell it for two okades* of soap. We were so excited that we offered them three okades in exchange. We put it in our warehouse and repaired it with a Norton swingarm, a BSA gearbox and BSA brakes. It was easy to find spare parts at that time, either in junk yards or from abandoned military vehicles. We asked our father to give us the crowbar he used to extract stone from a nearby quarry; he refused, angrily at first, but finally gave it to us. Using a lathe in a local workshop, we transformed this crowbar into an axis, to which we fitted two BMW wheels. Finally, we assembled a new motorcycle; but we had to demolish the wall of our warehouse to get it out, after which we started riding around.1 This story is representative of the case studies in this article; namely a Car Culture forged by people tinkering with cars and motorcycles1" and their decoration in Greece during and after WWII. Such activities were mainly undertaken by people who assembled vehicles using the spare parts found in abandoned military trucks and cars in order to make up for the shortage of civilian transport during the Nazi Occupation (1941-44). These practices became part of the Car Culture of empirically-trained mechanics until the 1950s, and many of them started using their self-taught techniques to earn a living, such as Alexandros Topaloglou, quoted above. From the 1960s on, improvised reconstructions of vehicles were gradually replaced by the repaired second-hand vehicles that dominated the Greek market until the 1980s. The cultural value of speed replaced the practical reasons that had made the reconstructions and repairs necessary during the earlier period. As a result, the customers of the empirically-trained mechan ics who had indulged in the user-oriented Car Culture of the previous decades frequently asked them not only to repair cars, but also to make modifications to enhance performance. After the 1990s, modifying stock automobiles became marginal, practiced mainly by the social groups which had been taking part in street races since the late 1970s, such as the kontrakias. Interestingly, since about 2009, vehicular tinkering has reappeared for reasons of necessity among recent migrants and the Roma. Modifying an automobile's manufactured features is a phenomenon * The oka (plural: okades) was a unit of weight equal to about 1.325 kilos. It was used in the Ottoman Empire, and remained in use in some Balkan states, including Greece, until the 1950s. f The discussion about automobiles in this examination of vehicular reconstructions during World War II and the immediate post-war years includes motorcycles, since they are included in the Greek general term autokinita (cars) in both the press and legislative sources during these years. Moreover, the two were only vaguely distinguished until the early 1950s, since the assembled vehicles were very often neither cars nor motorcycles, but something in between, namely a tricycle called furkoni, described by M. Arvanitopoulos in Iorogía rov e.U.t¡vacov Morooi'xkeziofiov (Athens 2006), 12.</page><page sequence="3">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 159 observed under a variety of socio-cultural conditions. A number of studies indicate that tinkering with cars or decorating them are processes with both socioeconomic and cultural explanations. In many cases these practices are related to parameters, such as limited imports of new automobile and motor cycle models and the shortage of spare parts, professional experts or repair facilities. The work of Jojada Verrips and Birgit Meyer on the Car Culture in Ghana is representative of this.2 Even if the primary motivation of such practices is necessity, they can also be a significant expression of their users' creativity and skills. They likewise create a field within which male identity and solidarity are forged in the lower or middle classes. Research by Lewis H. Siegelbaum on the Car Culture in the post-war U.S.S.R., Richard Schweid on automobility in Cuba and Kurt Moser on automobility in East and West Germany from the 1950s to the 1990s outline the economic and cultural aspects of such practices.3 In addition, Kathleen Franz's research on early automobility in the U.S.A. has shown that, in a period when repair facilities had not yet expanded to meet the demand, automobile owners used their cars not only to signify their independence and social status, but also as objects on which they tinkered and practiced their ingenuity.4 The study by Ronald Kline and Trevor Pinch about the use of automobiles by farmers in rural America during the same period as stationary power sources depicts a similar aspect of the issue.5 There are also research studies showing that the activities of vehicle modification, tinkering or decoration can serve primarily cultural and aesthetic purposes. The anthropological research of Brenda J. Bright on Mexican low riders in Houston, Los Angeles and northern New Mexico show how the aesthetic modifications by Hispano groups on their cars are a material manifestation of their personal and cultural identity. A related aspect is depicted in the studies by H.F. Moorhouse on hot rodding in the U.S.A. from the 1950s to the 1970s and by Robert C. Post on drag racing. Both studies use anthropological tools to examine the culture of car modifi cations made by enthusiasts aiming for the best possible performance of their personalised car. The study by David Lucsko on hot rodding in the U.S.A. presents a different view of the same phenomenon, focusing both on its anthropological aspect and technological development from 1915 to 1990.6 Regarding similar practices in the Greek socio-cultural context, this paper is based on four main hypotheses. First, the definition of the examined object does not anticipate its essential treatment. Rather, the definition is based on the hypothesis that modernity is not a globally unified phenomenon taking the same forms in multiple geographical spaces. Consequently, modern processes, such as the technologies' domestication in the social actors' every day life, presuppose the existence of culturally and politically defined spatio temporal frameworks in which certain significations are produced.7 Thus,</page><page sequence="4">160 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics such processes should be understood in their heterogeneity. As Bright has shown for example, in her research about low riding in the Hispano culture, the same practices can have a different meaning in different areas even for the same ethnic group.8 The second hypothesis on which this research is based is that the cultural biographies of technological artefacts can, in many cases, be independent of the typical procedure of their industrial design, manufacture and marketing as commodities, since their material form can be dialectically shaped with the incorporation of different social significations within various contexts.9 Moreover, technology users can play an active role in the evolution of their everyday industrial products within the domestication process in ways that differ from standardised commodity consumption patterns.10 Both automobiles and their users are usually examined within the con sumption process as it has evolved under modern capitalist production. This view presupposes a dichotomy between work and leisure activities, and sees users as passive receptors of industrial output.11 Still, technological artefacts can be constructed in ways other than on a factory assembly line. As I will show, the line between users and mechanics is sometimes blurred. The third hypothesis of this research is that the practices of assembling and decorating vehicles also should be examined as processes of interaction between automobiles and their users, which takes place, in this case, within a hybrid socio-technical network. Since the automobile communicates aesthetic and cultural codes, it incorporates a normative system that defines, evaluates and redefines the social actors' identities; and it reshapes the sense of self through the social actors' interaction with their material environ ment.12 At the same time, in cases such as the modification or decoration of vehicles, users can play a decisive role in the configuration of their vehicles, and the two together form what is called a hybrid. The term car-driver assem blage, introduced by Tim Dant, can also be quite useful in understanding the user-automobile interaction. Such an approach can contribute to under standing the taxonomies in the automobility network, and the co-evolution of technologies and social actors.13 Finally, the fourth and most central hypothesis of this paper concerns the hermeneutic tool of 'interpretative flexibility'. Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker introduced this term within the theoretical scheme of the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT).14 In the aforementioned article by Kline and Pinch, the active user's role in determining an artefacts use and significance is described, which can be quite different from what was antici pated in its industrial design and production.15 It has also been argued that in the majority of Western societies, at least, the 'interpretative flexibility' process took place until 1945 or the early 1950s, and subsequently, users' participation in the artefacts' significations became consolidated,</page><page sequence="5">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 161 contributing to the collective perception of the automobile as a fixed product or 'black box'.16 Regarding this approach, I discuss whether interpretative flexibility in the use and signification of automobiles is a concrete phase of a standardised procedure in which the industrial products are perceived as either 'open or 'black boxes', or whether it follows different paths within the culture of different spatiotemporal contexts or different social groups. Among the sources used in here are interviews given by amateur, empirically-trained mechanics as well as archival material from Greek mili tary records and the National Statistical Service of Greece, plus material from contemporary engineering and mechanical journals. FURKONIS, GAZOZEN AND OTHER CUSTOM-MADE VEHICLES World War I played a crucial role in the expansion of automobile use in Greek society, as was the case in many Western countries. It has been argued that the extended use of military vehicles in the Greek Army during the expedition against Turkey in 1919 contributed to the diffusion of Car Culture in Greece in the interbellum. The fact is that the growing use of the automobile in Greece concerned mainly the state services and upper classes. Despite a few instances of local vehicle manufacture, the expertise in repair ing cars resided mainly with chauffeurs employed by elite automobile owners. There were also instances of automobile owners repairing their own cars as amateur mechanics, perceiving this action as a type of sport. For example, Prince Alexander, a member of the Greek royal family, was an emblematic figure in shaping the collective imagination surrounding the Car Culture in early twentieth century Greece; he used to experiment on his cars and motorcycles. He would even intentionally cause malfunctions in them, in order to invent solutions using tools ordered from abroad.17 In addition to the upper classes, another category of automobile owners included professional bus and taxi drivers. Repairing their own vehicles, which could be perceived as a hobby for the elite, was a necessity for them. The scarcity of car repair facilities, especially in small towns and villages, forced these professional drivers to acquire some elementary technical expertise in solving problems with their vehicles. Before World War I and in the interwar period, automobile experts were self-taught or empirically trained, and, as has been shown elsewhere, in the early automobile age they were originally trained as wagon-makers or machinists.18 Higher education in Greece at that time provided only theoretical knowledge of engineering in universities, and even that primarily at the National Technical University of Athens; so there was only the tradi tion of empirical training for trades, such as repairing cars. Despite the</page><page sequence="6">162 Technology Users as Empirically-trained. Mechanics establishment of the Sivitanidios Public School of Trades and Vocations in Athens in 1927, of the Eucleides Technical School in Thessaloniki in 1936 and of the Heraclitus Technical School in Piraeus in 1939, where one could attend courses and workshops related with automobile maintenance and repair, only a small minority of auto mechanics graduated from them. The few car repair shops were staffed by technicians who had worked as apprentices. World War II proved to be a decisive factor in establishing a Car Culture involving tinkering or reconstruction. By early 1940, the Greek army owned some military vehicles; however, their inadequate numbers caused the army leadership either to commandeer civilian vehicles or to draft civilian auto mobile and motorcycle owners, who were then ordered to take part in combat, driving their own cars or motorbikes. A number of those civilian vehicles were retrofitted as military ones by Greek army mechanics.19 By the time Greece was defeated in 1941, the Greek army had taken the majority of these vehicles to Egypt where they were eventually abandoned, sometimes severely dam aged. Consequently, the only remaining vehicles that civilians could acquire and attempt to repair and use were stolen military automobiles and motor cycles or those abandoned by the Italian, British and, later, German army (Figures 1 and 2).20 In this way, people with no particular technical skill started experimenting on, repairing or assembling vehicles to employ for their own needs; neither public transportation nor trade functioned normally at the time. This practise of self taught repairers and assemblers was consoli dated during the Nazi Occupation of Greece from 1941 to 1944. Many Figure 1.

The most popular modification of that time was the furkoni, a modified tricycle made by welding the usually handmade chassis of a truck to the rear end of a motorcycle (Figure 3).23The reconstruction of motorcycles into such vehicles was inspired by the tricycles used by the Italian Occupation Army when they invaded Greece in 1941. Furkonis were used by their owners, who had also assembled them, to transport goods and people. The obliteration of any form of retail trade during the Nazi Occupation, in addition to the post war shortage of materials in the cities, led to the adoption of an exchange based economy that involved trading food grown in the villages for urban goods like soap, textiles or even jewel lery. Consequently, furkoni owners became couriers, using their vehicles profes sionally. The story of Alexandras Topaloglou, which opened this article, is one example of that situ ation. In other cases, users acted as self-taught mech anics; they built similar con traptions at the request of other members of their com munity and received various _j _ • . • _ Figure 3.

Depiction of a simplified gazozen mechanism. This device, in its extemporaneous version, was used extensively by amateur mechanics during the Nazi Occupation.

Wartime fuel shortages led many factories in Europe to experiment with this technology, and there were even instances of gasoline-fuelled automobiles that were converted to gas power in Finland and other countries.24 This method became popular during the war years in Greece, practiced primarily by self-taught mechanics. The gazozen was a device fitted to the car's internal combustion engine which provided the cylinders with gaseous fuel produced by a system of two metallic tanks, one enclosed within the other (Figure 4). The inner chamber contained solid fuel, mostly wood, which was heated (in the absence of oxygen to avoid combustion) by burning solid fuel (again, mainly wood) in the outer chamber. Fleating the solid fuel created combustible gases that were fed to the engine's cylinders through lines similar to the normal fuel fine of a commercial gasoline-powered vehicle. The entire device was in most cases quite a crude construction, sometimes made of household water heaters. " The word gazozen is a corruption of the French word gazogene (gasifier).</page><page sequence="9">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 165 While this technology was somewhat primitive and practised by civilians for their personal use or by self-taught mechanics, some interesting innova tions were developed to make this technology work. For example, if the gazozen would be functional even on uphill roads, the chambers had to pre sent some mathematical analogy with the engine's horsepower, which was attained empirically by tinkering with the chamber's perimeter.25 Another characteristic modification involved creating a 'hybrid' vehicle that used both fuel and gas-generating power. Even though most of the hybrid vehicle engines required only a small quantity of gasoline to start, using both fuels at once often presented problems; for this reason, some drivers usually fuelled their vehicles with gasoline but used the gazozen device when encountering Nazi roadblocks.26 The Nazis' conscription of the few repair shops fostered the empirically trained mechanics' Car Culture through a kind of exchange of techniques between the German officers, who demanded that their vehicles be repaired using a specific methodology, and the Greek repairmen, who used few tools and experimental methods to repair almost anything. The capabilities of the self-taught mechanics and their tireless tricks for stealing materials or fuel from the Nazi army, even though they knew they would be harshly punished if discovered, led the Nazi soldiers to describe them as 'devils'.27 Despite the Greek authorities' promises that the owners of private vehicles that had been confiscated would be compensated for their 'generous offer' to their nation after the war ended, no such compensation actually was forth coming, except in rare cases where some citizens were given a damaged vehicle, often different from their own. Consequently, during the early post war years the automobile was a very rare means of transportation, pro fessional or otherwise. Also, Greek governments imposed protectionist measures, which permitted only limited numbers of automobiles and motor cycles to be imported, with high import taxes on both vehicles and fuel. These reasons, together with the financial problems of the middle class, made car ownership out of the question for most people.28 Post-war Greek cities were full of unemployed citizens, both because the war had destroyed the national economy and because a devastating Civil War soon broke out between the Communists and the national army. That made it dangerous to live in the countryside and created a massive migration to the cities. A typical trade that an unskilled young man could pursue in the city, reflecting the work experience he had obtained during the war, was to repair and assemble cars or to be a driver delivering various types of merchandise. In any case, the vehicles abandoned in various locations by the Italian and German armies, as well as the damaged vehicles kept by the British army, once more served as the basic means by which somebody could try to earn a living. These vehicles did not meet even the most rudimentary safety</page><page sequence="10">166 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics standards; but, owing to the urgent need for transportation, state authorities ignored this fact.29 The vehicles circulating on Greek roads until the early 1950s may have originated mainly from Italy, Germany and England, but they bore no rela tion to the vehicles they had once been when they left the production line. They had become assemblages of military and civilian cars or motorcycles that combined different technologies from different times and were put together according to Greek mechanics' customised mod ifications and used for a much longer time than had been anticipated for the ori ginal models (Figure 5). The area in which the Greek army accumulated all aban doned military material was at Ellenikon in Athens - later an air terminal - and it provided spare parts to small auto-repair shops for years after the war ended. The fact that the billboards on many of these shops used the word Figure 5. A Buick brand taxi in a local repair shop in Piraeus in 'JVIodifications' instead of 1948. By courtesy of Petros Iatropoulos. &lt;r, • &gt; j *i j .1 1 7 7 r Repairs described the real work they did.30 This situation is also eloquently depicted in a typical news paper advertisement of the period, according to which an Italian 'Bonelli' motorcycle was for sale with British wheels and a German sidecar.31 Because of import restrictions, the material used in the assemblages was sometimes smuggled, at least until the late 1950s. For example, some assemblers travelled to Germany, where they bought spare parts of military vehicles from former Nazi army officers or their widows and then smuggled them into Greece. There were cheap hotels in Germany, according to some oral sources, which served as meeting places for people engaged in this trade.32 The improvised modifications practiced by mechanics in these shops so captivated the public imagination, that they were rumoured to have devised extraordinary techniques. The story told by Petros Iatropoulos, whether accurate or not, expresses the admiration felt by the local commun ity for the self-taught mechanics. Iatropoulos was a professional driver and amateur tinkerer who spent a significant amount of his life from the 1940s to the present repairing and modifying cars in workshops and restoring dilapidated antique cars to their original state. In his own words: Figure 5. A Buick brand taxi in a local repair shop in Piraeus in 1948. By courtesy of Petros Iatropoulos.</page><page sequence="11">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 167 In the 1940s my father, who was a driver, used to take me to the repair shop with him. There was a mechanic there who tinkered for a long time with a device. In the end he finished a construction that aroused enthu siasm. What I remember the other men saying was that he had made a device that used no combustible fuel. Instead, a contraption was fitted onto it that used the gradual release of air encased in a pressurised sealed container that produced centrifugal motion. Of course this contraption could not deliver any significant range, but it was a nice idea to begin with.33 GREEK AUTOMOBILITY SINCE THE 1960S: RACE-CAR RETROFITS, POWERFUL AUTOMOBILES AND FURKONIS In the late 1950s, especially from the 1960s on, the Car Culture in Greece followed consumption patterns similar to those in other Western societies. The rapid economic expansion of the state, along with partial changes in the government's import policy and the increase of middle-class purchasing power, made it somewhat easier for ordinary consumers to own a car. Automobile production by local industries also gradually increased as did imports, which led to a growing official trade in automobiles by agencies of the automotive industries.34 Although the number of private cars in the 1960s was below the average of Western European countries, it exceeded the average of Eastern Europe. According to some estimates, private auto mobiles in Greece numbered some 39,700 in 1960, placing Greece, for example, behind Switzerland with an estimated 450,000 cars and quite ahead of Romania, which had 8,500 cars. A year later, however, the National Statistical Service of Greece estimated 48,834 private automobiles and 33,303 motorcycles in Greece in 1961.35 The purchase of a new car, however, was still not the first choice of a middle class consumer. On one hand, the few and newly-created Greek vehicle industries focused on manufacturing either buses or trucks, since the local demand for privately-owned vehicles looked unpromising;36 on the other hand, since import taxes, although lower than during previous years, still remained fairly high, not many new cars were being imported. Consequently, imported second-hand vehicles prevailed in the Greek market until the 1980s.37 Although the unorthodox reconstructions of the previous period gradually decreased, modifications remained popular and survived in several variations until the 1970s. Many consumers preferred to buy cars that had been assembled in small repair shops from imported and hand-made parts. These small shops also produced civilian models built from chassis, engines and spare parts, some of which were imported and the rest were manufactured locally. Such models offered a more cost-effective solution</page><page sequence="12">168 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics than imported products, as well as giving users an opportunity to choose the particular characteristics of their vehicle and to order them from the assembler; thus, they personally intervened in the 'creation' of their car. Despite the decrease in the number of users who were also self-taught mechanics, assembling practices maintained an automobile's collective image as an assemblage built according to the user's choice. Such an attitude was also retained in the empirical training of the majority of mechanics who worked either in Greek factories or in repair shops. The re-establishment of the technical schools that had existed in the internar period did not change this situation. It was not until the early 1970s that Greek legislation made possession of a diploma from a technical school obligatory for car and motorbike mechanics.38 Until then, the majority of Greek mechanics had been empirically trained during their compulsory military service. In addi tion, during the 1950s and 1960s, many parents sent their children to work as apprentices, either without pay or with a very low salary in repair shops, or in the state military-vehicle industry so that they would eventually learn a trade. These state factories, such as the 301 Ergostasion Vaseos (301 Military Station Factory) in a western suburb of Athens became the technical school for hundreds of young people.39 From the 1960s on, a shift occurred in the socio-cultural reasons behind car reconstructions and modifications. In the early post-war years, un employment, the struggle to make a living, transportation shortages and the need to distribute goods motivated car reconstructions and modifications. But after the late 1960s, these practical reasons were replaced partly by cultural and aesthetic reasons. Assembling and repairing practices at this period were associated mostly with a culture of speed and the perception of automobility in its sporting and leisure dimensions, and many drivers attempted to increase the engine power of their cars to turn them into - or imitate - race cars. Consequently, empirically-trained mechanics who had indulged in the user-oriented Car Culture of previous decades were frequently asked by their customers not only to repair their cars but also to make modifications that would enhance their performance. The majority of them were race drivers who could not afford to buy a manufactured race car. Since participation in motor races generally is a hobby accessible only to a privileged minority, middle-class drivers who wanted to take part in such races had to be either mechanics themselves or have access to mechanics who were experts in retro fitting automobiles. Others were enthusiasts who valued speed as a way to enhance their social status and either had their cars custom made by mechanics or were mechanics themselves. George Raptopoulos, one of the most popular Greek race car drivers of the 1960s, is a case in point. As a teenager, he became an apprentice mechanic in</page><page sequence="13">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 169 repair shops during the Nazi Occupation. After the war, he was trained as a mechanic at the BMW factory in Germany. Later, while working at Viamax, one of the most important auto manufacturing and assembly plants in Greece, he used his professional experience to transform civilian car models, such as his favourite DKW and a BMW, into race cars. Driving his trans formed automobiles, he succeeded in winning a number of races, including the Acropolis International Rally, which contains some of the most chal lenging routes in Europe. As he noted himself, he was proud of his medals mainly because the majority of his competitors were driving standard manu factured race cars. He also said that the race cars participating in every rally had to have different standards, according to the texture of the track. Therefore, most of the drivers used a different car in every race. In interna tional rallies, one could see many Greek drivers driving the same car, which was modified each time to confront the particularities of each track.40 Another representative case is that of Christos Valassopoulos, a self-taught mechanic and inventor who became widely known among race car drivers by the nickname 'Boubis' and was awarded one silver and two bronze medals for three of his patents in 1996 at the International Trade Fair in Geneva. In the early 1950s, at the age of 13, he started working in the 301 Military Station Factory, and was later employed at a repair shop that specialised in Alfa Romeo products. Finally, he opened his own repair shop that specialised in custom camshaft development and construction. His inventive attitude led him to build prototype race-car models starting with Alfa Romeo and BMW engines and using spare parts he had made himself or acquired from third parties. With these cars some of Greece's most renowned race drivers, such as Iaveris41 won a number of Greek and international rallies. Valassopoulos's experiments on retrofits of stock cars to race cars made him one of the most experienced mechanics in all types of modifications or so-called 'enhance ments' of standard automobiles.42 It should be noted that the mechanics that practiced such modifications had to compensate for lack of training with sharp empirical observation. As Boubis relates, one frequent problem faced by someone who wanted to increase the power of an automobile in a repair shop was the fact that it was difficult to make a precise calculation of the compression ratio and displace ment of the engine after one had started increasing them. In his own words: Since at that age one didn't have the necessary measurement tools, I made some calculations and finally concluded that by multiplying the cylinder diameter by itself and by the piston stroke length, using the number of cylinders and 0.785 (which is V4 of Jt), I'd get the approximate total dis placement of the engine. But still it deviated from the factory specifica tion. I racked my brain over this until it finally hit me: I had to include</page><page sequence="14">170 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics the volume of the combustion chamber (the clearance volume) as well. To measure that, I slowly injected small pre-measured quantities of oil into the cylinder while holding the piston in the top, dead-centre position. It was a relatively simple method, suitable for use by any self-taught mechanic who had no advanced knowledge of mathematics, since you only needed to use multiplication; that's why, when I figured it out, I wrote it down on a piece of paper and gave it to any mechanic I knew who did the same work I did.43 The mathematical formula for measuring the compression ratio has been standardised as: l&amp;s-\-Vc (in which b = diameter of cylinder or bore, s = piston stroke length and V. = clear ance volume). But, this was something a self-taught mechanic probably would not have known, unless he noticed it empirically or was informed by another mechanic. The expertise mechanics gained by retrofitting stock cars to turn them into race cars was eventually used to enhance middle-class consumers' auto mobiles. At a time when Greek consumers fantasised about cars with high powered engines that they could not afford, there were mechanics, such as those mentioned herein, who offered them the solution of taking a low-cost car and increasing its power. Because the import taxes on both new and second-hand automobiles dur ing the 1980s and 1990s remained relatively high, it became popular to cut cars in half and import the front and rear sections separately, so they would be taxed as spare parts and not as an entire vehicle. They would then be assembled locally, and they became the object of popular second- or third hand trades that took place between the consumers of Western Europe and Greece.44 Such trades may have included a few illegal acts, since some of the imported cars had either been stolen or were sold by their owners after declaring them stolen to their insurance company. In any case, these consumer-exchange networks provided an alternative route for the diffusion of technology. The consumers' efforts to own an affordable car that measured up to the best possible standards created technological methods that, whether successful or not, strove in practice to replace those methods devel oped in industry. Apart from the consumers who asked mechanics to enhance their cars, there were also a small number of amateurs, like Petros Iatropoulos, for whom tinkering with cars was an end in itself. As he noted: 'I would never be paid for reconstructing an antique car. When you do something like that, all you need is to give life to something dead.'45</page><page sequence="15">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 171 Wf- I - - ?4. !i°eQ ^ H Figure 6.

Source: E. Petropoulos, La Voiture Grecque (Paris 1976), 45. After the 1990s, the development of technology within the automotive industry, such as adding electronics to automobile subsystems, made after sales technological modification extremely elaborate and expensive and required an escalating degree of expertise, which meant that the whole pro cedure was no longer addressed to the average car owner.46 This process contributed to establishing the mainstream collective perception of the automobile as a 'black box'. Higher per-capita income, as well as significantly lower taxes, made it possible for the average consumer to buy a new car. As a result, the Car Culture of custom-made vehicles that had come into being since World War II was only of interest to marginal groups of auto enthusiasts. In Greece, such groups were primarily connected to the culture of delin quent youth and to the social status of masculinity (Figure 6). These drivers had the nickname kontrakias, which is slang for those who participated in gambling and illegal car races between the late 1970s and late 1990s. The custom modifications made by such drivers, who were either teenagers or young adults, were retrofits of stock to race car models done either by them selves or by mechanics. The historian David Lucsko' notes: 'car enthusiasts [have a] passion [which] is not passive. When they see cars, they don't see finished products; they see untapped potential.'47</page><page sequence="16">172 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics Within such a cultural environment, a phenomenon found worldwide, the 'competition' between industrial and users' technologies constituted the material manifestation of a macho youth culture featuring risk and violation of the law. Such races in Greece became an emblem of the youth culture from the 1980s on. Taking place usually after midnight and at a dangerously curvy point on the coastal road outside Athens called Limanakia (small harbours), the collective perception of such races is associated with the ultimate destina tion of the car ride, namely the beach, which became a symbol of freedom, escape and flirting in the popular youth culture of post-war Greece. Today another minority group in Greece that is also concerned with assembling and modifying cars includes people that are involved in such practices for reasons of necessity. Wrecks of cars from previous decades that lie abandoned in junk yards are now being used as a source of spare parts for contemporary constructions of improvised tricycles like the old furkonis. These assemblages are constructed and used by scavengers, usu ally Roma or new migrants to Greece, in order to earn a living (e.g., to transport the paper or metal they collect from recycling bins to recyc ling facilities).

Such vehicles have appeared since 2009, and even though they are not widespread, they do indicate the fact that some social groups maintain a different perception of the automobile than the fixed image represented in mass media. THE CULTURE OF AUTOMOBILE DECORATION: FROM THE 1950S TO THE 1970S The culture of drivers who assembled cars themselves or had them assembled by empirically-trained mechanics created an attitude of personal connection between car or motorcycle owners and their machines. Between the 1950s Figure 7. A contemporary 'furkoni' assembled by a Roma youth. He found a motorcycle abandoned in a junk yard in the outskirts of Ioannina, which he estimated dated back to the 1950s.

The habit of decor ating personal vehicles is also found in some Asian societies, such as India,48 and has been characterised as a cultural practice in which drivers continue the tradition of ornamenting their vehicles just as their grandfathers once decorated their carriages. The Greek version of this custom involves mainly bus and taxi drivers of the lower strata, which is also the custom in some Latin-American countries. It did not emphasise automobile ornamentation in accordance with traditional art. Although there have been examples of oriental-style decoration with amulets, pearls, worry beads, doilies crocheted by the driver's mother and religious sym bols such as small icons on both the exterior and interior of the car, the entire decora tion concept can be described as a public mani festation of the driver's personality through a vehicle conceived as an extension of his ego (Figure 8).49 Characteristic of this practice are phrases written On the front or rear of an Figure 8. An example of a decorated three-wheel truck. Greece automobile that express the 1970s. A. Oduniíóris, NeoeUr/viHt) AQXixexzovixfi, (AGriva driver's worldview and are 1984)&gt;386 part of a masculine stereo type that uses driving as an expression of dynamism, independence or even sex appeal, in addition to the pride of the poor man struggling to make a living. Examples include phrases like: 'If I don't marry you, I'll die', 'You women are all the same', 'There are no real friends', 'Hey Dude keep your distance', 'May the Virgin Mary be with you', 'You ungrateful woman', 'Don't be jealous of me' and 'I have toiled to have you'. At the same time, a vehicle that has been assembled and decorated by his owner is considered an artefact with its own personality and plays a crucial role in the driver's profession and prestige. For this reason many automobiles were given names, like the boats of fishermen in the Greek islands. This is partly to be expected, considering the fact that a number of bus and taxi drivers were ex-fishermen to whom the Greek state offered low-cost professional licenses in compensation for the fact that they became unemployed because the building of new roads replaced sea connections in many places. Names like 'The lion of the asphalt', 'The Tiger', 'The unlucky lad', 'The avenger' and 'Papillon' (from the 1973 Figure 8. An example of a decorated three-wheel truck, Greece 1970s. Δ. ΦΛυιπίδης, Νεοελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική, (Αθήνα 1984), 386.</page><page sequence="18">174 Technology Users as Empirically-trained Mechanics movie with Steve McQueen) show that the automobile was conceived of in an almost fetishist or even anthropomorphic way.50 The culture of automobile decoration indicates that, in addition to the fact that the imported cars driven on the Greek roads eventually became differ ent from those produced in factories, Greek drivers also embraced an alternative perception of the industrial automobile product. Contrary to the image of mainstream automobiles promoted as fixed entities in consumer auto magazines and exhibitions, these vehicles had no official representation in public discourse. Nevertheless, they promoted a collective perception of alternative automobiles or motorcycles as assemblages built to reflect their owner's personal creative skills, intelligence and taste, and thus formed a kind of extension of their body and personality. CONCLUSION My work here is born of four main hypotheses. The first is that automobility should be studied in specific spatiotemporal contexts. The context of a state with a limited local auto industry and government policy that imposed restrictions on imports for a long period can be quite useful in studying the history of technology from the users' viewpoint, and it elucidates the users' creative role in the reconstruction and signification of technologies. The second hypothesis is that an important activity involving both users and technologies can take place on the fringe of consumption and produc tion. I have shown that the cultural biographies of industrial products can become independent of the standards by which they were designed, con structed and produced.51 In this process, users do not always act as passive receptors of industrially-produced technological innovations. On the con trary, they become involved in a creative interaction, within which the material nature and significance of both artefacts and users are reconstructed. This is illustrated in the experiences of many of the users who worked as empirically-trained mechanics in the early post-war years. The blurred line between users and mechanics, under certain conditions, indicates the mutual reconfiguration of the role of users and artefacts alike. As argued in the third hypothesis of this article, examining users and automobiles as car-driver assemblages can be useful in understanding case studies characterised by the crucial role of the technologies' domestication in the social actors' everyday life. The fourth hypothesis concerns the discussion about whether or not the phases of the users' 'interpretative flexibility' have been standardised. It revisits the idea that, during the technology domestication process, users' participation in the signification of artefacts solidifies after a certain point. In the case of the automobile, this process took place between 1945 and the</page><page sequence="19">Alexia Sofia Papazafeiropoulou 175 early 1950s, and it contributed to the collective perception of the car as a fixed product or a 'black box', at least in the majority of the Western societies.52 Although this may be the case in many socio-cultural contexts, the 'inter pretative flexibility' period with regard to users' actions in alternating the factory standards or significations of technology is not always a concrete phase in a standardised process during which industrial products are either perceived as 'black boxes' or as re-openable boxes available for alternative interpretations. Moreover, such a process does not always follow the same path in diverse spatiotemporal contexts. Such a view could imply a normative and somewhat ideological conception of global progress. Consequently, cul tural practices like the ones described in this article would be categorised as exceptions to a general rule. This could obscure the heterogeneity of such phenomena under different socio-cultural conditions, especially in the action of certain social groups such as the low riders, the hot-rodder in the U.S.A., as well as the Roma, the migrant or the 'kontrakias' in the Greek Car Culture. It could also obscure the heterogeneity of the socio-cultural causes that generate these phenomena. As I have shown, the necessity that pro duced the vehicular reconstructions of World War II and the early post-war years was replaced by the Car Culture of custom modifications that origin ated in the cultural apotheosis of speed. And, today, vehicular assembly has reappeared for reasons of necessity among certain groups of people. Thus, the process of'interpretative flexibility' can remain open indefinite ly under certain circumstances, including controversial social interactions between the products of officially-produced technology and of local builders' practices. Furthermore, users' alternative perceptions can coexist with those of the dominant technology and survive for years in many versions, either marginal or competitive, keeping the 'black box' of technology open for some non-dominant groups in various ways. In any case, users' on-going inter action with their vehicles reshaped both of them constantly, creating fluctu ating hybrids or car-driver assemblages,53 NOTES 1 A.
