London and Washington: Cassell, 1997. 219 pp., 84 b/w illus. and plates, further reading, glossary, bibl., index, pbk. (ISBN 0-304-70058-4). Review by Eric Kjellgren The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Art and religion in Oceania are almost always insep arably entangled. The majority of the masks, figures, paintings, and similar objects that have subsequent ly been recontextualized in the West as "Oceanic art" were originally produced and/or used in religious contexts. Given the central position of religion in the arts of most Pacific peoples, a survey of the diverse roles that art plays (or played) in the region's numerous religions is long overdue. In Arts in the Religions of the Pacific: Symbols of Life, Albert Moore attempts to fill this gap by providing an overview of the plastic arts in Oceanic religions. One can admire Moore's determination in taking on such an ambi tious project. Unfortunately, his book falls far short of its goal. Instead of providing a coherent survey of the topic, Moore's text is largely a haphazard assem blage of individual case studies with little attempt at synthesis or integration, which can only serve to confuse rather than enlighten the non-specialist readership at whom it is targeted. Moore s stated objective is to approach "...the arts as a way of understanding the life and soul of the people who practice them..." (p. xiii) through a general discussion of the phenomenon of religion in the Pacific followed by a geographic survey of art in the relgions of Australia, Melanesia, and Polynesia. In the final chapters, however, this geographic approach breaks down as Moore chooses to include Micronesia in the "Polynesia" section and then devote a separate chapter on the art of the Maori. In the preface and introduction, after an oddly apologetic section entitled "Why be interested in the Pacific?," Moore begins a dry and lengthy summary of various definitions and theories of religion as they relate to the arts of the Pacific. Moore states that he . .does not seek to impose or prove a theory but to draw on a variety of theories..." (p. xiii) and later condemns the "misplaced evolutionism" which for merly portrayed Oceanic religions as "primitive" (p. 9). However, he later goes on to adopt an explicitly evolutionist model in which what he calls the "pri mal" religions of Oceania are said to antecede world religions such as Islam or Christianity and "...con tinue to show many of the basic or primary features of religion" (p. 9). By using "primal" rather than "primitive" Moore here is simply substituting a new term for an old concept without questioning the outdated paradigm of which it forms a part. His the oretical survey, in fact, ends in the 1970 s and com pletely ignores the so-called "postmodern" perspec tives of the last twenty years. While he need not agree with these approaches, he ought at least to mention their existence. Moore s attempt to encompass all Oceanic reli gions within a single category is itself an unrealistic oversimplification. Apart from their geographic proximity and small numbers of adherents, many Oceanic religions have little in common. The mythology and supernatural beings of Polynesia, for example, arguably share more formal similarities with those of Classical Greece than either of these traditions does with Aboriginal conceptions of Dreaming. Hence, Moore's contention that all Oceanic religions are united by certain "primal" characteristics seems unsupported by the very diver sity of the traditions he describes. Apart from its questionable theoretical approach, the text contains a number of factual errors such as Moore's statement that all Oceanic peoples beyond Australia speak Austronesian languages (p. 3) or his oddly illogical contentions that the Highlands of New Guinea were settled prior to the coast (p. 90) and that it was a shortage of wood that made possi ble the moai of Rapa Nui (p. 144). After his theoretical overview, Moore proceeds with a survey of art and religion in each of the major cultural regions of Oceania, beginning with Australia and working eastwards through Melanesia and Polynesia (to which he appends Micronesia). Rather than presenting concise and coherent region al summaries, however, the texts of these chapters often have the quality of an undergraduate term paper in which blocks of information from various sources are strung together by a series of brief link ing sentences without any attempt at integration or synthesis. At times it appears the author simply sat down with a series of Pacific Arts Association pub lications and cobbled together a text by connecting random pieces of information. July 1999 109</page><page sequence="2">Although the book was presumably written in English, many sentences give the impression of being awkward translations from some unknown foreign language. For example, Moore describes the importance of the eyes in the moai on Rapa Nui as follows: "This indicates a belief in the power of the image to be awakened once the eyes were put in, hence to be controlled by not activating them until the right time" (p. 144), and earlier states that, in the Solomon Islands, "Anthropomorphic figures are also a feature of ancestor posts cut from a tree-trunk to be incorporated into houses of special concern" (p. no). Equally confusing sentences abound through out the book. photo of a museum case containing Abelam, Iatmul, and Lower Sepik objects in which a small painting of a haus tambaran appears in the background. It is hard to imagine, even given a limited budget, that no better image was available. In addition to more pervasive issues of content and style, there are a number of specific problems with individual chapters. In his treatment of Australian Aboriginal religions, for example, Moore at first describes these phenomena in the singular, talking of "Aboriginal culture" and "Aboriginal reli gion," ignoring their inherent diversity, and later (on the same page!) switches to the plural without any explanation (see p. 30). The terminology he uses to describe Aboriginal religious concepts is also incon sistent as he switches between "Dreaming" and its older equivalent "Dreamtime" indiscriminately throughout the text. Apart from its textual difficul ties, a number of the illustrations that accompany the chapter depict secret-sacred objects and activi ties, an act of cultural insensitivity that many con temporary Aboriginals may find inappropriate and offensive. Melanesia fares little better. Moore's use of terms is again inconsistent as he employs both "Irian Jaya" and "West Irian" at random to describe the Western half of New Guinea, a practice that can only serve to confuse the reader. At one point he describes the "heathen ways" of Melanesian societies without using quotation marks (p. 80) but is later careful to put the term "pagan" in quotes (p. 112). Such incon sistencies, which should have been caught by even a novice editor, occur repeatedly in the text. One of the weakest features of the Melanesia chapter in particular, and the book in general, is the quality of the illustrations, many of which appear to have been selected from random snapshots of the Oceanic displays in the Otago Museum. For exam ple, Plate 29, described as an illustration of an Abelam haus tambaran, is actually a poorly cropped The chapter on Polynesia suffers from many of :he same problems as its predecessors and ends with the incongruous inclusion of Micronesia on pages [55-58 (Moore states this is done "for convenience") followed by a one paragraph summary of religion on likopia. The ensuing chapter on Maori art also seems oddly out of sequence. Apart from the fact that the author is based in Aotearoa, there appears to be little explanation for his separating the Maori from other Polynesian peoples, especially since the :)ther regions of "Marginal Polynesia" are included in the previous chapter. Moore's concluding remarks an "Modern Maori Artists and Biculturalism," how ever laudable in their motives, are also of little rele vance to stated theme of the book. To Moore s credit, however, in the final chapter and throughout the text, he addresses the subject of change in Oceanic art in a manner that recognizes that art and religion in the Pacific are ongoing phe nomena. Rather than espousing the view (still all too common) that all postcontact art and religion are "tainted" and "inauthentic," Moore acknowledges the dynamism of art and religion among Oceanic peoples, exploring the development of contempo rary art traditions and addressing such topics as the history of Christian art in the Pacific. Taken as a whole, there is little to recommend Arts in the Religions of the Pacific as a text for either specialists or interested lay readers. Its individual chapters are so clumsily compiled and poorly edit ed that they only serve to confuse an already com plex topic. It would be less confusing, in most cases, for readers to get the information from the refer ences listed in the bibliography than from the text itself. To attempt to summarize the diverse relation ships between art and religion across Oceania is a formidable task, particularly for an author who, as in the present case, appears more familiar with the topic of religion in the abstract rather than with the Oceanic cultures he is attempting to describe. A concise overview of the roles of art in the religions of the Pacific would certainly be a valuable reference to scholars of Oceanic art and religion as well as the general public.
