<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SILVER SENSIBILITY: FIVE RECENT BOOKS OF AMERICAN POETRY* "It is not necessary that whosoever sees a mirror should see all that is in a mirror, unless his glance comprehend the mirror itself." -St. Thomas Aquinas There exists a sensibility in contemporary poetry that can be called silver. The metaphor is very ancient, possibly one of the oldest we have, and its function (as in all metaphor) is to establish relationship: an Age of Silver succeeds a Golden Age and precedes two ages of pro- gressively more debased metal, bronze and iron. As a whole, the four ages constitute a single cycle, one turning of the universal wheel, toward the end of which, in the Iron Age, ceaseless warfare breaks out and finally culminates in a cosmic holocaust that ends time itself, and a Golden Age is then recreated and time begins again. In short, the metaphor is a myth. As myth, the metaphor gives an Age of Silver a contradictory vision, whereby the age still sees the celestial city where, in the preceding Golden Age, the Universal King dwelt, at the same time it foresees the coming ages when all kings will become merely destroyers and all cities battlegrounds. A Silver Age is thus at once * The poets discussed here were selected from those publishing books between August 1968 and December 1969. In order of discussion, they are: A. R.

A Silver Age distrusts the very cycle that defines it and so mocks its sustaining myth by mocking myth itself, and its sense of a circle is therefore social, not cosmic: "we," the free few, see with intricate and difficult dis- crimination the real, yet hidden King, while "they," the enslaved many, worship the apparent, yet false gods of destruction. Obviously the myth is more a permanently possible configuration of attitudes than a historical narrative, and the silver sensibility is crucial, I think, to some recent poetry. A primary dimension of the silver sensibility in poetry is its sense of style. Wallace Stevens comes closest to catching in a single axiom the idea of silver style: "The style of a poem and the poem itself are one." This idea involves, on the one hand, an antithesis between what is said and the way to say it and, on the other, value given to the latter: "obviously if it is true that the style of a poem and the poem itself are one, it follows that, in con- sidering style and its own creations . . . the poets who have little or nothing to say are, or will be, the poets who matter."' The initial antithesis, then, does little more than to create the context in which to assert the value, and the assertion, though endlessly qualified, re- mains nevertheless an assertion. As an idea, it is clearly nonsense, since it rests upon a distinction that can demonstrate no difference; but as a revelation of sensibility, this assertion of style over subject is definitive. For the silver sensibility feels poetic style to be, at its deepest level, stylish and therefore inaccessible as idea or mere "content," since the stylishness exceeds not only the subject but the particulars of style in any given poem in the same way that a first and final cause exceeds its various effects. The depths of stylishness are thus (as Aristotle might say) the Art that remains in the artist after he has made the art-work: and so it comes to be the sensibility itself as well as the certain proof of it. Style thus becomes the force that unifies everything, and it is in this sense that Stevens can say: "it pretty much amounts to saying that the structure of poetry and the structure of reality are one or, in effect, that poetry and reality are one, or should be" (my emphasis). Here, then, is the essential play at the center of silver poetry: since poem and world should be one, the game is to make them so. And here, too, is the essential evasion at the center: the unity of everything in style 1 Wallace Stevens, "Two or Three Ideas," Opus Posthumous (New York, 1957), pp. 202, 204. AMERICAN POETRY | 99</page><page sequence="3">is asserted only in order to create the dualities of the game. Moving between game and evasion, style can thus become the trap of unreality that must be perpetually denied in favor of the real "real world"-out there, beyond the words, as simply seen and known as kicking a rock. And so the silver sensibility completes a perfect circle and arrives at the version of reality held by the despised "they" of the brutishly literal mind. It can only begin again. The poems of A. R. Ammons are illustrations of this sensibility. A primary technical fact about his poetry is that he has listened as few poets have to Pound's Cantos. For the anti-pentameter line yields in Ammons as it does in Pound a metrical surface whose instability as- sures that the technical medium remain precisely and always a me- dium: Shot from stream into spiral, Or followed the water. Or looked back to flowing; Others approaching that cataract, As to dawn out of shadow, the swathed cloths Now purple and orange, And the blue water dusky beneath them, pouring there into the cataract, With the noise of sea over shingle .... -Pound, "Canto XX" I went for a walk over the dunes again this morning to the sea, then turned right along the surf rounded a naked headland and returned along the inlet shore .... -Ammons, "Corsons Inlet" (p. 136) In both, the prosodic medium is kept so fluid that it cannot become symmetrical and so can only become an expression of sensibility. This metamorphosis of medium into psyche becomes itself an event five lines on in "Corsons Inlet": the walk liberating, I was released from forms, from the perpendiculars, straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds of thought into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends of sight . .. (p. 136) 100 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="4">Hues over boxes, a release from thinking into seeing-here are the silver choices crystallized, for the intricate, shifting appearances of things that we see and cannot merely think about are not to be caught in the boxes that symmetrical verse thinks up (stanza means room in Italian). Fixed shapes dissolve into momentary organizations, and the aesthetic motion becomes (as it must) "eddies of meaning" and wholly unpredictable changes. Thus, the sensibility becomes for Am- mons the mirror held up to nature; and to express the whole of the sensibility becomes in "Corsons Inlet" the sought-for aesthetic shape: there are dunes of motion, organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance in the overall wandering of mirroring mind: but Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events I cannot draw, the ledger I cannot keep ... (p. 137) A definitive paradox in Ammons' silver sensibility emerges, then. The attempt to widen the poem's scope is marked by a contradictory "freedom that/Scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision" (p. 140). With the unattainable Overall and the elusive Scope we see in Ammons a general characteristic of the myth: that is, the contradictory, knowing nostalgia the Silver Age suffers and enjoys in relation to the Golden Age and its deus absconditus. The hidden god is of course an aesthetic being in contemporary silver poetry; and in "What This Mode of Motion Said" Ammons personifies the aesthetics in order to permit the god to speak in accents whose ironies are pure silver: I change shape, turn easily into the shapes you make and even you in moving I leave, betray: what has not yet been imagined has been imagined by me whom you honor, reach for- change unended though slowed into nearly limited modes . . . (p. 104) This god who is absolute modality is at the same time "shapeless, un- spendable, /powerless in the actual/ which I rule," for he is only the poem's unstable metric at the same time he is the condition of con- AMERICAN POETRY 101</page><page sequence="5">stant change in the actual world. He is therefore hidden in the past and yet here, and "pressed for certainty / I harden to stone,/ ... leave you less certainty than you brought." The apprehension of him is the primal intricacy in Ammons, for this god is finally the Sensibility we see mirrored in the sensibility. The contemptible "bosses / in little factories" and "men who / have never heard of modes" endlessly insult the silver sensibility and may, at times, even triumph over Sensibility, thereby "humiliating my worshippers." Yet even though (as Stevens has it) elegance must struggle like the rest, the only genuine danger lies within: I betray him who gets me in his eyes and sees beyond the fact to the motions of my permanence. (p. 106) Here, in silver aesthetics, is Sin. As Aquinas says: "A created intellect, in seeing the divine essence, does not see in it all that God does or can do," for though we might hypothetically see everything in the mirror (but actually we never do), still we cannot in the same glance compre- hend the mirror itself. The myth of the Silver Age is thus in Ammons quite literally in- formative: that is, the complex metaphor is at every point giving shape to the things said. In this way, then, the Silver Age provides the poems their ground of mental attitude and the surface workings of their technique, with the result that even the most casual perception can touch the sensibility's ground in Sensibility and reach great intensity: the terns, their young somewhere hidden in clumps of grass or weed, were diving sshik sshik at me, then pealing upward for a new round and dive: I have had too much of this inexhaustible miracle: miracle, this massive, drab constant of experience. (p. 133) The constant hope of Ammons' technique is that the poetic event will stay grounded in the moment of its creation and be wholly intelligible, for precisely and only in those moments do the idea of sensibility and the sensible image-the mode of seeing and the thing seen-fuse to become the actual myth. And the constant end of Ammons' technique is to project, intact, these mythic moments so that the reader reaches with comparably miraculous, sudden ease the same mythic center. Am- 102 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="6">mons calls the mode of his poetry "Motion"; it may also be termed projective. James Merrill's poems enact the social drama of the silver sensi- bility rather than its inner ideas-and do so with such exactness that the distinction (as intended) dissolves: here is the opening of the splendid "Words for Maria": Unjeweled in black as ever comedienne Of mourning if not silent star of chic, You drift, September nightwind at your back, The half block from your flat to the Bon Gout, Collapse, order a black Espresso and my ouzo in that Greek Reserved for waiters, crane to see who's who Without removing your dark glasses, then, Too audibly: "Eh, Jimmy, qui sont ces deux strange men?" (p. 12) No mere idea about Maria could ever replace this exactness, and yet the stanza is far more than a mere snapshot; and the point where pictures of things become more than their "viewy" dimension is precisely where Merrill's drama of sensibility begins. A sentence of La Fontaine's is useful: "Je n'appelle pas gayete ce qui excite le rire, mais un certain charme, un air agreable qu'on peut donner a toutes sortes de sujets, mesme les plus s6rieux." This kind of complex gaiety is an aesthetic phenomenon, for it is prior to subjects of any sort and is a way of seeing things: and thus it becomes the sensibility. The air agreable in Merrill's poetry is therefore a musical quality as well as a social manner, and so is an "air" in the further, more intricate sense in which "breathing" best translates the Greek concept "psyche." And this complex "air"-manners: music: psyche-touches simultaneously the lightness and strength of Merrill's sensibility. Its silvery charme thus partakes at once of pleasantry and magic. It is perfectly consistent, then, that the last and longest poem in the new volume is a ballad: here is speech become a singing whose rhythms, even when comic, quite literally enchant. Called "The Sum- mer People," the ballad operatically treats a central topic in silver drama: the Passing of Elegance. The backdrop is an attractive village on the Maine coast where, each summer, the native residents debate whether or not to permit into the community the Chemical Plant, which would of course destroy the scenery, pollute the water, and thus drive the summer people away. In the foreground are four summer AMERICAN POETRY 1 103</page><page sequence="7">people, "the Amusing, / The Unconventional ones," and the drama concerns their encounter with a new, attractive summer visitor named Jack Frost. Though as utterly meaningless as a plot summary of an opera, some of the leading events of the ballad can be indicated: Jack is an immense success socially among the summer people, though his decision to stay on for the winter shocks them slightly; the following summer is splendid, as are several more after that, until the Amusing Ones decide one September they too will stay on for the winter. Every- thing instantly deteriorates, while the poem's narrative line ceases and the drama moves into a series of lyric scenes: Jack drinks heavily, everyone turns vicious (including Jack's cat), and the once lovely summer society collapses from within as though suddenly and very badly it had grown old. There is, in other words, an organic view of society in the drama; and with its death comes the new and grotesque Age of the Chemical Plant: One window framed the sunset Transfiguring Main Street, Its houses faintly crimson But upright in defeat. The other faced the harbor. Lights of the Chemical Plant Gloated over water. "The grasshopper, the ant," Breathed Andrew, recollecting His long ago remark, Then shut both views behind him And felt his way down in dark. (pp. 76-77) The sunset of defeat, then the deeper darkness: and with the last nostalgia-that intricacy of viewpoint matters-firmly placed behind, the ballad ends in this state of terrifying knowingness. (Rarely, by the way, does a Merrill poem ever strike us as knowledgeable, for it is as if states of knowledge were too heavy to be singable and to become airs -precisely the case, one notes, with opera as well.) Here in this knowingness is a mockery of the myth of mockery as the Silver Age viewpoint detaches itself from its own detachment and enters into darkness; and so here, then, is gaiety given to the most serious subject imaginable, the end of gaiety. So serious, in fact, are the drama's final moments that the one silvery quality they retain is prosodic: they move in the same technical medium as before and thus help keep the poem's endgame from becoming inexpressibly serious. In this sense, 104 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">then, the ballad "returns" to its tidy technical surface solely in order to touch the expressible depths of its drama. And this coalescence of surface and depth raises the deeper question of poetic mode. Symmetrical prosody is crucial not only to "The Summer People" but to all of Merrill's poems, and his reliance on the iambic pentam- eter is related to his constant use of the sonnet: they are the metric and rhyme-stanza patterns of symmetrical poetry in English. As a re- sult, Merrill's poems are not so much expressive in their bases as reflec- tive, for he premises prosodic symmetry upon an idea of the poem as a mirror and not, as Charles Olson would hold, the poem as a mecha- nism for projecting the poet's deepest psychic states onto the reader's emotions (see Olson's "Projective Verse" essay, from which I have taken the term). This distinction between the symmetrical and the projective modes is crucial, I think, and can be made by noting that the radical beginning as well as final decadence of symmetrical verse is a world of infinite mirrors in which in the decadent phase one sees only oneself, while the alpha and omega of projective verse is a single note the voice holds interminably and which, in its decadence, becomes emotionally expressive the way a child's whining is. Sym- metry begins in the innocence of reflecting everything precisely as it is, while projection starts with a primal outburst of joyously self- affirming song. Along the way, each mode curiously needs the other- for given an instinctive center in one mode, a poet seeks constantly the other as "content" or else is doomed to a kind of aesthetic vanity and therefore inherent triviality (which is the case, I think, in the recent poems of Eberhart and Wilbur, on the one hand, and Robert Creeley and Anne Sexton on the other)-and so Merrill's symmetries undergo slight, but constant skewing from the emotional pressures of expressiveness: Into the flame Godmother put her hand, Lulling the olive boughs. Lymph welled from them. I too in her strange house Kindled and smoked and did not understand. Followed the Cyclopean meal: Loaves, rice, hens, goats, gallons of sweet red wine. I mellowed with the men Who now waxed crackling, philosophical -For all I knew-but then Were on their feet, with flashlights, tramping out In ancient Air Force overcoats After the small birds roosting roundabout. (p. 33) AMERICAN POETRY 1 105</page><page sequence="9">The formal analogue is of course opera: "The point... was to arrange for one's /Own chills and fever, passions and betrayals, / Chiefly in order to make song of them" (p. 50). This operatic condition is every- where in Merrill and it means that every word and phrase has as much musical as psychic content, and in "The Summer People" it means that the characters can easily pass into and out of a "symbolic" oi purely musical condition, as when Jack Frost becomes his legendary namesake in order to hear from a dogwood tree a central lesson of the drama: "Old friend, think! First things first, / Not June in January" (p. 66). In the symmetrical mode of Merrill's art, then, we can see the musicalization of the silver sensibility. The Complete Poems of Elizabeth Bishop raises the point that one difference between the great "modernist" poets of the twentieth century and some more recent ones lies in an attitude toward nine- teenth-century, especially Victorian, literature. With Eliot, Pound, Willliams, and Stevens, some still find the nineteenth century shallow and tiresome; but the work of a number of good recent poets has taught us how again to read, say, the novels of Dickens with rapt and grateful attention. The point is worth noting if only because the strange isolated quality of Elizabeth Bishop's poems, that air they seem to wear that no other poems really exist, is diminished some- what if we see them alongside, say, some Matthew Arnold: Coldly, sadly descends The autumn evening. The field Strewn with its dank yellow drifts Of wither'd leaves, and the elms, Fade into dimness apace, Silent;-hardly a shout From a few boys late at their play! -Arnold, "Rugby Chapel" Although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting, his net, in the gloaming almost invisible a dank purple-brown, and his shuttle worn and polished. -Bishop, "At the Fishhouses" (p. 72) Similarities in meter, mood, and subject aside, these passages are primarily alike in having natural settings; and as in Arnold's poem, so 106 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">in Miss Bishop's, although the landscape is not an expressionistic de- vice for revealing the inner psychic state of the speaker, it is neverthe- less quite radiant with intelligible meaning. Such radiance is every- where in a poem like "A Cold Spring," as here in the final lines: Now, in the evening, a new moon comes. The hills grow softer. Tufts of long grass show where each cow-flop lies. The bull-frogs are sounding, slack strings plucked by heavy thumbs. Beneath the light, against your white front door, the smallest moths, like Chinese fans, flatten themselves, silver and silver-gilt over pale yellow, orange, or gray. Now, from the thick grass, the fireflies begin to rise: up, then down, then up again: lit on the ascending flight, drifting simultaneously to the same height, -exactly like the bubbles in champagne. -Later on they rise much higher. And your shadowy pastures will be able to offer these particular glowing tributes every evening now throughout the summer. (p. 64) That mysterious ability to find just where meaning inheres in the thing seen rather than coheres with the seeing mind has, I think, been essentially lost to the projective mode in contemporary poetry-that is, moments of inherent meaning are not of the essence of the mode but of its accidence. Both Matthew Arnold and Elizabeth Bishop possess this ability, and their poetries therefore reach back to the English poet who best understood the deep mysteriousness of such a talent, Wordsworth-who in turn reaches back through eighteenth- century "landscape" verse to Vergil's magnificent Georgics. Thus, though they give off no allusive resonance whatsoever, Miss Bishop's poems are solidly in a poetic tradition far older and possibly more sig- nificant than, say, Ezra Pound's. Yet, at the same time, this "tradi- tion" is a curious one, for the mysterious talent that exemplifies it is one that must be fashioned utterly anew by every poet within it-and, further, by every poem written by that poet. A remark of Auden's is useful: "Every time he writes a new poem, the same question occurs to him: 'Will it ever happen again?'" This question occurs as a AMERICAN POETRY 1 107</page><page sequence="11">serious one only when the poems are like Miss Bishop's, for the tradi- tion they are in is one that can never become a literary movement be- cause it can never have aesthetic techniques separable from the particular and personal acts of insight into things. In order for someone to write anything at all like Elizabeth Bishop, one would have to be her. The comparable and contrasting question for someone in the Pound tradition would thus be: "Will this new poem ever stop happening?" It is in this way that technique in Miss Bishop's poems constantly dissolves into sensibility and there widens into a kind of ethical concern: since there is little "technical" point, to what greater purpose does her mind see into the meaning of things? Such an ethical question is grounded in the aesthetic facts of her ppems. The primary appeal of her poetry is, of course, to the eye- that most abstract of senses, the one that always gives us a world which is "over there" and never psychically "here": Father wears a dirty, oil-soaked monkey suit that cuts him under the arms, and several quick and saucy and greasy sons assist him (it's a family filling station), all quite thoroughly dirty. (p. 149) Such fastidiousness is largely a function of the kind of poem Miss Bishop writes, and the moral possibility of such aesthetic detachment -that one simply can't care about what one sees because caring blurs one's sight-provides her with her most significant subject matter. (One recalls Matthew Arnold's inability to transcend this kind of fastidiousness, and how in his poems he transmuted the inability into complex and, in their way, quite terrifying insights into loneliness.) Subject in this sense is an aspect of mode, and Miss Bishop is con- stantly able to move from merely seeing into truly caring and to do so in a way that is (we are utterly persuaded) a movement as well into greater seeing. For instance, the first stanza of the poem above, "Fill- ing Station," begins "Oh, but it is dirty!" and passes through the stanza just quoted and then into three stanzas in which small but attractive things are seen. The final stanza goes: Somebody embroidered the doily. Somebody waters the plant, or oils it, maybe. Somebody arranges the rows of cans 108 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">so that they softly say: ESSO-SO--SO-SO to high-strung automobiles. Somebody loves us all. (p. 150) This is, morally, very complicated and lovely. The detachment remains as sarcasm ("or oils it, maybe"), yet the seeing is transfigured into a caring whose very limitations-established in the final four lines by ironies so gentle we can sometimes only just hear them in the verse rhythms-serve to deepen the caring into a kind of charity that is actually lived in rather than merely hoped for. And that a good deal of complex beauty exists here (and elsewhere in her poems) by virtue of the voice's accents and overtones illustrates another dimension of her art: it sustains an aesthetically useful music of great attractiveness. For Miss Bishop, metrical matters are thus moral considerations-but never vice versa, one adds. The mode of her poetry, then, is the symmetrical, and this aesthetic fact involves her in certain social attitudes and outlooks. This matter can be most directly grasped in Miss Bishop's translations, for it is here that every word and phrase is intrinsically a social en- counter with another's voice, outlook, and whole sensibility. Now, since Pound's theories and practices (though surely not because of them), the translation of poetry has followed what I think is a course of increasing solipsism, to the point where reading most of the recent work is like entering into one of those nightmares in which everything insanely keeps changing into something else-and the Something Else remains horribly the same. Such is not the case with Miss Bishop's translations, for in reading them we hear her accents lighting up with- out absorbing another's voice, so that her translations become genuine illuminations of foreign texts and not dazzlings of them: And you never liked parties ... Old man, what a party we'd give for you today. The sons that don't drink and the one that loves to drink, around the wide table, gave up their grim diets, forgot their likes and dislikes; it was an honest orgy ending in revelations. Yes, old man, you'd hear things to shock your ninety years. (p. 169) AMERICAN POETRY I 109</page><page sequence="13">This is the opening of a poem entitled "The Table," by the con- temporary Portuguese poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and it continues for some ten pages, at the end of which one feels, quite simply, very grateful to Miss Bishop for having translated it. The suc- cess is due in part, I think, to a metrical matter: her English retains a center in symmetry but continually and easily accepts the asym- metries of actual speech. The effect is that of hearing song at the very center of speech; and while the need to understand what's being said keeps our attention on the speaking, we are always aware of the deeper singing. And that this singing is at once utterly natural in English and wholly unlike Miss Bishop's own reveals its translated nature. In the symmetrical mode of Miss Bishop's art, then, we can see the silver taste for complexity literally justified, for we can see its deeper ground in a sense of justice which creates those rare translations that strike us as true beyond any technical sense; and the silver sensibility moves without a break from aesthetics into ethics. In a new poem called "Profile," W. H. Auden says of himself: Vain? Not very, except about his knowledge of metre, and his friends. (p. 30) Such vanities are, of course, pure silver, and they would be immoral rubbish were not what was claimed so true-Auden does know more about meter than any other comparable modern poet, and it is equally clear that he has a number of enviably fine friends. This second point is not so purely "personal" as it sounds, for Auden's poetic voice is one which presupposes and embodies a personal speech of great at- tractiveness: Can Sixty make sense to Sixteen-Plus? What has my camp in common with theirs, with buttons and beards and Be-Ins? Much, I hope. In Acts it is written Taste was no problem at Pentecost. (pp. 120-121) Few can remember clearly when innocence came to a sudden end, the moment at which we ask for the first time: Am I loved? (pp. 47-48) "So let each while you may think you're more O.K., CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE 110 I</page><page sequence="14">More yourself than anyone else, Till you find that you're hooked, your goose is cooked, And you're only a cipher of Hell's. Believe while you can that I'm proud of you, Enjoy your dream: I'm so bored with the whole fucking crowd of you I could scream" (p. 42) Translating personal speech into a poetic voice is, in the very broadest sense, a metrical matter, for the act involves catching in one's own speech its rhythmic dimension and then measuring out, or "metering," that dimension in some desired way. And if truly listening to someone else is difficult, then listening to oneself with the humility and detach- ment needed really to hear the rhythm of one's own speech is probably impossible; and what one then measures out is not a unique voice but a voiceless sameness. In this sense, then, a knowledge of meter and a talent for friendship come together. And within this coalescence, we can see the aesthetic basis for Auden's "social commentary" verse or poetry of manners, and thereby begin to understand his associations with the Muse of discursive poetry: The High Priests of telescopes and cyclotrons keep making pronouncements about happenings on scales too gigantic or dwarfish to be noticed by our native senses, discoveries which, couched in the elegant euphemisms of algebra, look innocent, harmless enough but, when translated into the vulgar anthropomorphic tongue, will give no cause for hilarity to gardeners or housewives: if galaxies bolt like panicking mobs, if mesons riot like fish in a feeding-frenzy, it sounds too like Political History to boost civic morale, too symbolic of the crimes and strikes and demonstrations we are supposed to gloat on at breakfast. (p. 97) That such a Muse exists this passage confirms absolutely; that we understand her is another matter. For the primary effect intended by discursive poetry is to make sensibility seem only common sense, so AMERICAN POETRY | 111</page><page sequence="15">that its artlessness comes to attest to its truthfulness. This effect is a very complicated one, indeed, for the artlessness is only apparent while the truthfulness is essentially aesthetic. The genuine artfulness of Auden's discursive verse is, I think, musical. In the above passage, for instance, to ignore line endings so as to read it only in the rhythm of its prose sense is to transform the symmetries of its metrical ordei into an expressionistic mechanism for projecting emotion. (The first stanza identifies meter and meaning point for point, so that we are taught straightaway how to read and hear the poem properly.) And this symmetrical surface passes at every point through the prose sense and into a musical depth in which speech is shape before it is meaning. This depth of music is generative in the sense that every particular speech shape will take only that word or set of words whose aural nature aesthetically "fits" the shape. Here, then, is the purely aesthetic basis of decorum in Auden's verse-that is, a poetry "of the heart" is one which suits the depths of its own inner music, and thus is fitting. (This phenomenon may have some association with what Noam Chomsky calls deep structure in language.) The depth of "pre-signify- ing" shapeliness is at once reflected by and embodied in the symmetri- cal surface of the poem, so that the mirror of meter simultaneously receives and creates the sense of the poem. In this way, then, the sensible truth of a discursive poem is not simply secondary to the music and meter but is actually created by them. And this creative function of music and meter can, through the simplest personification, be termed the Muse of discursive poetry. The sister Muse (or, in contemporary terms, the related genre) of discourse is satire. In one way, satire is only a specialized kind of dis- course; in another, satire is the end toward which discourse works. In the title poem of the new volume, "City Without Walls," Auden has twenty stanzas of gloomily accurate commentary on the horrors of contemporary life; then, three lines into the twenty-first, the quotation marks opened at the first word are suddenly closed and the poem ends this way: Thus I was thinking at three A.M. in mid-Manhattan till interrupted, cut short by a sharp voice. "What fun and games you find it to play Jeremiah-cum-Juvenal: Shame on you for your Schadenfreude." 112 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="16">"My!" I blustered, "how moral we're getting. A pococurante? Suppose I were, so what, if my words are true." Thereupon, bored, a third voice: "Go to sleep now for God's sake! You both will feel better by breakfast time." (p. 7) This interruption ends the poem, and its function is to move the poem from the discursive genre into the satirical by satirizing not the dis- course itself but the poem's discursive mind. This distinction is crucial, for the fact that one "will feel better by breakfast time" says nothing whatever about the brutal conditions of social existence and quite a bit about the speaker's need to be pampered; and the serious moral dilemma of malice versus telling the truth is, we are left to suppose, one which is psychologically unresolvable in a three A.M. mood of self-justifying bluster. A primary point of the closing satire is thus clear: to forget that discourse is first of all music and thereby inherently joyful is to lose grasp of the very mode one speaks in and thus simply to fall to pieces (voices two and three). The essential anger of poetic satire, here muted into the sarcastic boredom the third voice expresses, thus serves a "corrective" purpose in precisely the same way poetic discourse serves a "didactic" purpose: that is, the anger like the teaching has aesthetic ground and direction. In this sense, then, satire is a permanent possibility at every moment in dis- cursive poetry. Together, satire and discourse "teach" us-though the instruction is entirely aesthetic-that it is better to be joyful and musical than not, since their absence most often accompanies if not causes the collapse of men's minds and cities. Symmetry is therefore in Auden the deepest poetic instinct and greatest need, for the joy and music at the center are wholly the result of symmetry. He is thus one of the very few twentieth-century poets who could write an "Ode to Terminus" and say: "blessed is the City that thanks you /for giving us games and grammar and meters." And yet Auden has learned the lesson of modern projective poetry: that symmetry cannot be merely decorative, that it must run deep into the poem and find its ground there. This is an awesome poetic task, of course, for were it ever done with total success, then the distinction in modes which created the task would in itself be abolished and the answer would absorb the question. But the mere possibility of such a total success is generative for the symmetrical AMERICAN POETRY | 113</page><page sequence="17">poet, while the greater likelihood of partial success can for us be illus- trative: Trying to understand the words Uttered on all sides by birds, I recognize in what I hear Noises that betoken fear. (p. 38) There is nothing really wrong with this, except its triviality. And, to me, it is trivial because of the symmetry: the stanza is merely struc- tured nattering, speech that rather than becoming song has become merely an utterance whose sense is slight, whose promptings are un- fathomable because insignificant, and whose only apparent reason for being is that it can then arrange itself into a decorative pattern. Struc- tured nattering is, I think, a danger at every instant in the symmetrical mode, and consequently Auden is in his poems always seeking projec- tive "content"-as, for instance, in the brief satire at the end of "City Without Walls." Symmetrical prosody is thus capable of being deep- ened into genuine feeling, and this is Auden's richest knowledge of meter-as in the opening stanza of "Amor Loci": I could draw its map by heart, showing its contours, strata and vegetation, name every height, small burn and lonely shieling, but nameless to me, faceless as heather or grouse, are those who live there... (p. 35) Auden's work, then, is in best sense opera aperta; and the aesthetic energies created by the constant movement of technical symmetry toward projective expression are at once reflected by and embodied in the energies released by his constant discovery as subject matter that, at its depth, society exists for one as psychic pressures and that each one's psyche is thus the gravest matter for public concern. If Miss Bishop's poetry showed us a sense of justice, then Auden's takes us to the generative ground of complex principle where human justice is both an image and an idea of divine Charity; and out of as well as on this ground he then constructs commentaries about it. Song 221 of John Berryman's recently completed long poem, The Dream Songs, begins with remarks that are aesthetic comments 114 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">on the whole poem as well as dramatic and moral moments in it: I poured myself out thro' my tips. What's left? I slipt. I slipt. What's right? Whose centre's where? (p. 150) In writing The Dream Songs in the projective mode, Berryman has written a poem that intrigues if only because the mode is so apparently quite literally demode. Berryman is the direct heir of Pound's Cantos and Williams' Paterson, those great monoliths of projective modern- ism that now belong to the academies because so few outside them seem to have the time, mind, or need to puzzle them out. Berryman half suspects this fate for The Dream Songs and bravely jokes about it late in the poem: will they set up a tumult in his praise will assistant professors become associates by working on his works? (p. 305) That the concluding portion of the poem, Songs 78 to 385, is filled with crack-up, suicide, and death-and especially poets'-is not uncon- nected, I think, to the poem's aesthetic basis; or, to say it the other way around, the projective mode may now possibly be suited only to expressing collapse and death. But even to raise the point is to realize that is at least moot, for in reading The Dream Songs one comes to feel about modernism as Gibbon did about Rome: the wonder is not that it finally fell apart but that it held together so well for so long. There is thus an aesthetic fin d'empire air about the poem, and in reading it one has to have a taste (to use Mallarme's figure) for the streaks of rouge rather than the fresh cheeks of youth. One comes to enjoy it, in fact, in the same complicated way Mallarm6 enjoyed the barrel organ in the street: "While it murmured a gaily vulgar air, such as puts mirth into the heart of the suburbs, an old-fashioned, an empty air, how came it that its refrain went to my very soul, and made me weep like a romantic ballad? I tasted it slowly and did not throw a penny through the window for fear of stirring and seeing that the instrument was not singing by itself" (Plainte d'automne). Song, as the title tells us, is central to the poem. Berryman's pref- atory note to His Toy, His Dream, His Rest "explaining" the poem's ABC's is nowhere nearly as helpful as the single sentence in the 1964 volume, 77 Dream Songs: "The opinions and errors in the Songs are to be referred not to the character Henry, still less to the author, but to the title of the work" (my emphasis). How one understands the AMERICAN POETRY 1 115</page><page sequence="19">process of referring is of course everything, and I take the whole sentence to mean: what is said in the poem is the consequence of the way it is sung. Song is thus for Berryman what Musique was for Mallarm6: "L'air ou chant sous le texte, conduisant la divination d'ici la .. ." (Le Mystere dans les lettres). Such music is apprehended only in the dream state at the same time it is itself an ancient dream of a union of word and song within the singing voice. And in this second sense of dream, Berryman's Song approaches the state of a Mallarmean fiction: "Contrary to the function of an easy, representative currency as the crowd at first treats it, the [poetic] statement-before anything else, dream and song-rediscovers in the Poet its virtuality by the con- stitutive necessity of an art consecrated to fictions" (Crise de vers). The Dream Songs is thus essentially a poem of immense artifice, and the guiding fiction at the center of its music is that of the Singer: Henry, weak at keyboard music, leaned on the slow movement of Schubert's Sonata in A &amp; the mysterious final soundings of Beethoven's 109-10-11 &amp; the Diabelli Variations You go by the rules but there the rules don't matter is what I've been trying to say. Huddled, from their recesses, the goblins spring (I'm playing it softly as I can) while the sound goes roaring ... (p. 133) And in the third and last stanza occurs: "my gramophone is the most powerful in the country, / I am trying, trying, to solve the andante." The Singer is the first idea and invented ground of the poem's music, for he creates the songs and therefore exceeds their expressive intent in the same way the unity of creative cause exceeds the multiplicity of created effects. The Singer is in this sense the poem's mode, then, and so is both its aesthetic cause and technical process since whatever enters the poetic "field" as subject matter becomes instantly significant merely by being in the mode. This phenomenon is what Charles Olson calls "open field composition," and its result is that the poem becomes (or can easily become) a perpetual motion. For the inexpressible Singer endures beyond all the inexpressive songs solely in order to project still deeper, more revelatory ones; and the whole sustaining fiction endures so long as the poet keeps on imagining it. The mode of the poem is musical, then, and not autobiographical, and even though the imagined Singer is always moving toward the imagining 116 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="20">poet, the fiction remains the aesthetic center and the poem translates autobiography into music, not vice versa. The poet is simply one more "character," then, and so has no more influence over the course of things than do any of the others. Now, such a statement may seem to take the poem's fiction too liter- ally, yet it touches upon a genuine problem in all long projective poems: how to end them. The one true conclusion to The Dream Songs would be the death of the imagined Singer who is the poem's mode of being. But such a death is so final that it can be truly imagined, I suspect, only in the wholly opposite mode of symmetrical poetry, and so it seems to involve the greater death of the poet's imagination. It is thus an aesthetic point to say that the Cantos will conclude probably only when Pound dies; or to recall that notes and fragments for a sixth book of Paterson were found after Williams' death; or to see that the preoccupation with death as release in The Dream Songs runs to the very center of the poem's aesthetic existence. "I will not come again / or not come in this style," we are told in Song 379, and in 382 Henry (the Singer's primary persona) is dead and buried, while in 383 there is a "dreamless night" as though "the end of the labour" signalled an awakening from dream. But in 384, the "I" returns to his father's grave: I'd like to scrabble till I got right down away down under the grass and ax the casket open ha to see just how he's taking it, which he sought so hard we'll tear apart the mouldering grave clothes ha and then Henry will heft the ax once more, his final card, and fell it on the start. (p. 316) Henry "once more"-how one's heart sinks, for we see for Berryman the same chill fate that Pound now suffers: the poem that refuses to let go. And the dream of song threatens always to become a hellish nightmare. This possibility of nightmare is a technical matter as well as a dramatic dimension in the poem. On the poem's surface, we see gram- matic categories being shifted in function constantly, as syntax is bent and sometimes broken under the pressures of expressive utterance, with the result that grammar itself dissolves into a wholly fluid medium capable of taking new, startling shapes. Prosodic symmetries are begun, too, then simply abandoned only to be regained a little later AMERICAN POETRY | 117</page><page sequence="21">through the craziest of balancing acts. The net effect is an utterly new poetic voice whose only antecedents are "non-poetic" ones such as W. C. Fields, Krazy Kat, and the Marx Brothers in certain of their more baroque moods: Survive-exist-who is at other's will optionless; may gelded be, be put to stud, and were sweating sold; was sold. -Mr. Bones, dat slavery still is of our former coast. -When they make me, Bud, I show my genitals, cold. (p. 202) Wordsworth, thou form almost divine, cried Henry 'the egotistical sublime' said Keats, oh ho, you lovely man! make from the rafters some mere sign to me whether when after this raving heart which beats &amp; which to beat began Long so years since stops I may (ah) expect a fresh version of living or if I stop wholly. Oblongs attend my convalescence, wreckt and now again, by many full propt up, not irreversible Henry. (p. 312) This voice is essentially an artifice in the way, for instance, the comic strip is, and it has the same immediacy and immense flexibility. The "Mr. Bones" blackface persona reinforces this analogy, for Bones is at once the clownish loser in the minstrel show and the blues singer singing of lost loves: and so is the two-dimensional caricature who is always taking on a third, vital dimension within our response to his "simple" singing. Rhyming is crucial to this voice. When, in each stanza, the symmetry gives way, the speech then edges away from song and out toward greater and greater cacophony (and which, if followed out, would culminate in the aesthetic equivalent of nightmarish screaming, after which would be a terrible silence); but always at the point of maximum cacophony the rhyme word appears out ahead as something that must be reached. And so a local problem of composi- tion takes over and creates a "shape": how does one get verbally from here to there? And this compositional shape is what reestablishes the song whose music generates what is to be said. Here, then, is the idea of shape in the projective mode, and it means something utterly differ- 118 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="22">ent from shape in symmetrical poetry, for we perceive this projective shape not as a stable, unified arrangement of varying elements on an aesthetic surface but as a momentary gathering together of unstable pressures at a psychic depth. Projective technique is thus tied to the initial moments of creative activity, while symmetrical technique is based on its last stages-which is not, one notes, a difference between carelessness and careful polishing, or between formlessness and form, for a good projective poem will take as much polish and care as a sym- metrical one and will possess "form" in precisely the same degree, or else form is a completely meaningless term. With The Dream Songs, then, we can see that the aim of projective technique-to get the poet's depths, as Charles Olson says, up onto the poem's surface and instantly over to the reader-contrasts with the symmetrical poet's desire to deepen surfaces into greater expressiveness. And so we see that the projective goal is to cohere here and there (poet and reader) along a projective arc and thus create a unity; while the symmetrical goal is to show the co-inherence of here and there in the reflecting surfaces of the poem and thus create a harmony. The former is a matter of here to there, the latter is one of here in there, there in here. The difference between the projectivism of A. R. Ammons and John Berryman thus becomes solely a difference in sensibility. And this difference can be seen in metaphoric or mythic terms. The Iron Age's instinct for cataclysm drives the desperation of The Dream Songs, while Ammons' ironic, complicated balances are part of the casual yet tensile manners of a Silver Age. Imagining the two of them condemned to Purgatory to discuss, say, Pound's Cantos is in- structive-one hears Ammons quietly yet firmly insisting over and over that: earth brings to grief much in an hour that sang, leaped, swirled, yet keeps a round quiet turning, beyond loss or gain, beyond concern for the separate reach (p. 145) while Berryman would fling back, testy and incessant: Hunger was constitutional with him, women, cigarettes, liquor, need need need until he went to pieces. The pieces sat up &amp; wrote. They did not heed their piecedom but kept very quietly on among the chaos. (p. 243) AMERICAN POETRY | 119</page><page sequence="23">So their purgation would continue for centuries, until in a miracle of mutual illumination each would at last really listen to the other-and at that instant they would hear and understand Pound's latest and possibly last poetic utterance: Two mice and a moth my guides- To have heard the farfalla gasping as toward a bridge over two worlds. That the kings meet in their island, where no food is after flight from the pole. Milkweed the sustenance as to enter arcanum. To be men not destroyers. All poetic modes and sensibilities finally become one in being in- stances of the Secondary World of art that is always approaching but never reaching the Primary World we must live in. And Pound, like Auden much earlier, has here reached the insight that the Secondary is precisely what comes second and that, as Gary Snyder recently wrote in an essay on Mahayana Buddhism: "No one today can afford to be innocent, or indulge himself in ignorance of the nature of contempo- rary governments, politics and social orders" (Earth House Hold, p. 90). Of the five poets here-and of most twentieth-century poets, too -only Auden has truly understood this imperative and so only he has reached the last chiarezza possible for poetry, the point where the closed aesthetic world opens up into the larger Primary World and there comprehends the essential difference that illumines the similarity.
