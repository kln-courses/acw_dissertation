<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deciphering America: The American Scene Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Allen Ginsberg (A Supermarket in California, 1955) Since the 1940s The American Scene has been a sort of closet classic but it has never found as many readers as it deserves. This makes one all the more grateful to have it in print again, from a small publisher, when larger houses have mostly passed it over.1 Not that its relative neglect has been surprising. There is much in it to make its reader feel uneasy. Neither Americans nor Europeans can feel comfortable with its troubled picture of America: it gives the former a bad conscience whilst the latter feel as if they have intruded into the author's family quarrel with his homeland. It is also an ominous book, an admonitory prophecy of what both civilisations have since become. For it is no longer possible to make a contrast between America and Europe as James did. Even now, few people, on either side of the Atlantic, can afford to admit that America had gone as far off course as James thought it had. Neither the wryness nor the charm of James's late style can disguise this anxiety. Remarks that begin by being jovial finish in anger, circumlocution issues in bluntness, what appears mellow and affable usually harbours a sting. The one thing The American Scene is not is what it is often imagined to be: an evocative, uncritical 'travel book' To the Henry James who returned home in 1904, after over twenty years away, America was not simply an actuality to be chronicled but an hypothesis to be explored. It moved him to both prose poetry and to comminations but not to reportage. Not for him the travel writer's customary assumption of understanding everything he sees: his strength was to understand those moments when he didn't understand. As he soon realised, the ťold home' which he had come back to commemorate no longer existed. Hence the rueful, 1 From Granville (London, 1987). The same publisher has also had the excellent idea of reprinting Wells's The Future in America , Trollope's North America (2 vols) and Dickens's American Notes.</page><page sequence="2">350 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY self-communing tone of his book, its blend of pained reminiscence and baffled curiosity. James saw at once that he had no place from which to try to decipher America but his own very partial experience of it, with all its lacunae. He said in a letter that he would have liked to call the book The Return of the Native , had not Hardy used that title already, but returning, in any but the merely physical sense, was what proved most difficult of all. Much of the obliquity and convolution of the book's prose derives, in fact, not from literary mannerism but from this quandary of being unable to identify exactly what America was. He hedged his impressions around with qualifications because that was how they came to him, as vivid but cryptic hints unanchored in any informing sense of America as a whole. He had to talk to himself as he sized those impressions up because he knew he had no sure common ground from which to share them with other Americans. In his eyes, America, for all its self- confidence, was still only half-created. Moreover, the more he saw of it, the more he began to feel that it was only able to create its future at the cost of destroying great areas of its past. Its only way of being new seemed to be to climb on the back of what was old, and then, once started, to kick it into oblivion. It was out of this sobering experience that this elderly literary Mandarin was enabled to write one of the least complacent accounts of America that have ever been written. As a returned expatriate, the journeys James made across America took him as much into his own past as down the Hudson or over the Mason- Dixon line. To everywhere he went he brought the memory of an America that was no longer visible, an America which the present had not so much continued as obliterated: his America was no longer there. Even the house in Washington Square where he had been born had been razed to the ground to make way for a 'tail building' . He did find the house in Boston where he had lived during his last visit, in the early 1880s, but only to find it demolished when he went back to it a few weeks later. This shock at discovering that America was busy amputating itself from its own past was the trigger of James's complex response to turn-of-the-century America, his nostalgia and horror and endless curiosity. But though many of his reactions were negative ones America did not simply appal James. It also exhilarated him (perhaps more than Rye ever did). If he pleaded for humane values in the face of what was happening to his country he did not fall back just on value-judgements as his defence against it. America struck him as formless and prodigious, a theme more for wonder than simple reprobation. In a sense, it was so wonderful that he could not quite believe in its existence or ascribe any clear identity to it in his mind. He could only impute meaning to it by contrasting it with the America of his youth. As a result, The American Scene is, among other</page><page sequence="3">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 351 things, a kind of fairy-tale. It often has the flavour of a romantic quest- narrative, with the author as the lone knight setting forth to brave some fabulous terra incognita. For all its dismal materialism his America is like a nightmare in Wonderland. Thus, it impresses him rather as Europe once had, at the start of his career: 'Europe had been romantic years before, because she was different from America; wherefore America would now be romantic because she was different from Europe.' The fact that James no longer had an American yardstick to bring to this new America ensured not just bewilderment but the uniquely flexible and plastic way in which he reported on what he saw there. It is this, and not any generalising about nationality, which gives us our cue. The modern reader, whether English or American, will probably be obliged to interpret his or her own country in very much the same fashion. We are no closer to the verities of our pasts than James was to his. James's way of acknowledging this sense of dislocation was to adopt the persona of a 'restless analyst', inquisitively labouring to make sense of the variegated surface of a to him alien world. Hence, his unabashed reliance on subjective insight, the easy way in which he lets his reader overhear him talking to himself about America. Analysis, in this case, meant surrendering to his impressions, not detachment, and James was every bit as dazzled and bemused by America as Strether was by Paris. He was quite frank about this and noted it down in the book's early chapters on New York: . . . we remember above all that the imaginative response to the conditions here presented may just happen to proceed from the intellectual extravagance of the given observer. When this personage is open to corruption by almost any large view of an intensity of life, his vibrations tend to become a matter difficult even for him to explain. Later in this chapter we find James referring to his 'bad habit of receiving through almost any accident of vision more impressions than you know what to do with' as his 'eternal handicap'. It was, of course, more of an asset than a 'handicap' but these remarks remind us that James did not indulge wilfully in such 'extravagance'. He used it instead as a means of improvising a response to the disorientating extravagance of America itself. Where nothing had a fixed character and his preconceptions were constantly being discomfited, metaphor came into its own: I like indeed to think of my relation to New York as, in that manner, almost inexpressibly intimate, and as hence making, for daily sensation, a keyboard as continuous, and as free from hard transitions, as if swept by the fingers of a master-pianist.</page><page sequence="4">352 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Without this virtuoso delight in playing his own variations on the violently chequered scene James would have been saturated by his impressions of New York, at a loss to master them. As it was, his need to confront a phantasmagoric America liberated an extraordinary vein of fantasy in his writing, a language that could be playful and bantering without sacrifice of either beauty or moral weight. The hallmark of this prose is a sort of serio-comic anthropomorphism which acts as a speculative means of informing the observed scene with those traces of humanity which, in practice, James was often pressed to discover in it. With this prose he can suddenly animate even the empty beauty of the American landscape: . . . half the poetry, roundabout, the poetry in solution in the air, was doubtless but the alertness of the touch of autumn, the imprisoned painter, the Bohemian with a rusty jacket, who had already broken out with palette and brush; yet the way the colour begins in those days to be dabbed, the way, here and there, for a start, a solitary maple on a woodside flames in single scarlet, recalls nothing so much as the daughter of a noble house dressed for a fancy-ball, with the whole family gathered round to admire her before she goes. James needed such virtuosity at the keyboard in a country where nature, like the skyscrapers in the cities, dwarfed and cancelled his sense of the human scale. To play with appearances was a way of not being swamped by them. America, to use the word he kept using himself, was an 'adventure' and, like the adventurers of fiction, he had to look at it with active and not passive eyes. Not many writers with a whole oeuvre behind them have written such adventurous prose. Already, by 1837, de Tocqueville had seen that the laws of America gave carte blanche to the party of change at all costs: Ce n'est pas que la démocratie américaine soit de sa nature plus instable qu'une autre, mais on lui a donné le moyen de suivre, dans la formation des lois, l'instabilité naturelle de ses penchants. {De la Démocratie en Amérique, vol. 1, ch. 11) Those extremists who advocated the rule of the 'sovereign present' became a ' tyrannie de la majorité1 , so preoccupied with founding the new that it forgot about the America 'qui existait déjà'. It was the consequences of this that so irked James in 1904: he could find no continuity between his country's past and what had been made of it. One America seemed to have blotted out another. What moved him in 'historic' places like Concord or George Washington's house on Mount Vernon was their pathos, the way the present seemed to constitute a threat of violence to</page><page sequence="5">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 353 them: 'the slight, pale, bleeding Past, in a patched homespun suit, stands there taking the thanks of the bloated present'. The past is only there to intrude upon, grossly. James's complaint, as a democrat and not just as an expatriate, is that America has betrayed and forgotten this past in its manic pursuit of commercial prosperity. He regrets not just its picturesque homeliness (he could still read Hawthorne instead for that) but such moral and political identity as had gone with it.2 In contrast, his emblem for the new America is the new emigrants from Europe, like the surly, un- Italian Italian of whom he mistakenly asks the way in Salem (of all places) only to be met with a blank stare. No doubt this Italian was looking for America too. James was deeply curious about him and his like but he made no claim to understand them; indeed, they only helped to make everything else so difficult for him to understand. But the more he strained to see what the 'melting poť would melt into, the clearer his image of the past which it suppressed became. His pictures of his own earlier haunts, both crisp and plangent, comprise those 'impressions' of America that he was most sure of. In his third chapter, after a visit to the New York ghetto, James pointedly withdraws, up the Hudson, until he reaches the former home of Washington Irving, an 'ideal refuge' from the present and a kind of 'qualified Sleepy Hollow' itself. It is 'unprofanable' and yet vulnerable too because 'modernity, with its pockets full of money and its conscience full of virtue . . . has seated itself there under pretext of guarding the shrine'. In more ways than one it is like Hawthorne's 'merry Mount': . . . the sense of his 'command' of the admirable river and the admirable country, his command of all the mildness of his life, of his pleasant powers and his ample hours, of his friends and his contemporaries and his fame and his honour and his temper and, above all, of his delightful fund of reminiscence and material, I seemed to hear, in the summer sounds and in the very urbanity of my entertainers, the last faint echo of a felicity forever gone. James looks back here from a present which has brought the railroad to such places. Yet he does not find them parochial: the spiritual landscape they evoke is an ampler one than his own times offered him. This almost paradisal note is not unique. It is especially vivid in his description of 2 In Hawthorne (1879) he does not mince his words on the provinciality of this older America. It could be argued that if the America of 1904 was so amorphous that was because Hawthorne's America was amorphous too, as James saw early on. This does not alter the fact that the one blotted out the other, rather as rural England is blotted out by industrial England in Lady Chatterley's Lover. Lawrence, of course, like James, wrote as a returned expatriate.</page><page sequence="6">354 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY the Newport where many of the happiest times of his own childhood were spent. Even money could be innocent before the Civil War! . . . dimmest days, days, such as now appear antediluvian, when ocean-drives, engineered by landscape artists and literally macadam- ized all the way, were still in the lap of time; when there was only an afternoon for the Fort, and another for the Beach, and another for the 'boat-house'- inconceivable innocence! -and even the shortness of the Avenue seemed very long, and even its narrowness very wide, and even its shabbiness very promising for the future, and when, in fine, chariots and cavaliers took their course, across country, to Bateman's, by inelegant precarious tracts and returned, through the darkling void, with a sense of adventure and fatigue. That, I can't but think, was the pure Newport time, the most perfectly guarded by a sense of margin and of mystery. It would be easy to dismiss such visions of pastoral innocence as the product of nostalgia (even in The Europeans and The Bostonians , much earlier, James had wished to invest in the myth of the innocence of old New England) but in 1904 he was not simply lamenting his own youth: he was lamenting America's too. It is unsubtle to attribute all his regrets to his expatriation: as R. W. B. Lewis has shown, there was no need for a nineteenth-century American to go to Europe or anywhere else in order to feel hankerings after some more primal America. James's feelings about his past were all to some extent shared by the likes of Melville, Whitman and Thoreau. But in him the issue became more complex because he had always had more reservations about this older American society which he came to look back on so fondly. The innocence' of Mr Wentworth in The Europeans , for example, is comic as well as noble. One doubts whether James ever really knew the 'felicity forever gone' of Sleepy Hollow from the inside. His wistfulness suggests rather that he embraced it as an alternative myth of America with which to confront the much ruder present. To see the pre-Civil War period as he did was not to regress but to make bitter implications about what followed it.3 It would, in any case, be literal-minded to imagine that James really believed that the Newport of his youth was as 'pure' as he pretended it was. It was only a comparative purity: the money had always been there even if it was not brandished for all to see. He was no foe to tasteful 3 In this respect, James was part of the larger tendency -a tragic one -for the work of the American imagination to take up an antinomian stance against the progress of American civilisation. Has any American artist ever expressed the social and political confidence of the country in the period between James and the Vietnam War?</page><page sequence="7">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 355 affluence, after all, nor was he tempted to equate purity with wildness as Thoreau sometimes was. The real change was, in some ways, social rather than spiritual: the wealth had fallen into new hands. What made him indignant in 1904 was to see how far it had become an end-in-itself and not, as it was for Isabel Archer or Milly Theale, a means to the end of a more civilised living. America had become parvenu. Yet even so it retained a kind of innocence, for all its vulgar ostentation, an unconscious- ness that moved him to anger but asked to be treated humorously. But it was precisely the unintentional crassness of the new rich which was so fatal for the past. Money inhabited only the present, as money always does. The brazen residences built by such money in New Jersey make a brilliant epitome of this strand in the book: 'We are only instalments, symbols, stop-gaps,' they practically admitted, and with no shade of embarrassment; 'expensive as we are, we have nothing to do with continuity, responsibility, transmission, and don't in the least care what becomes of us after we have served our present purpose.' What they will always lack is 'constituted privacy', the 'supremely expensive thing'. They belong, not with Mount Vernon or Sleepy Hollow, but with the civilisation of the big hotel; going 'one better' than the past they lose it. Theirs is a fallen America but they are still innocent of that knowledge. No one in The American Scene , apart from James, can weigh that disquieting fact as it asks to be weighed. The book plays out a tragi- comic drama between the alarmed visitor and the complacent natives, neither of whom can quite credit the other. It is, of course, a drama that has been re-run many times since and may explain why the book is still so topical today. James's feelings about pre-Civil War America were certainly coloured by the memories of his youth which flooded back during his travels but there was toughness as well as tenderness in them. His picture of Old Harvard Yard, for instance, is not only pious, as befitted an old student, but ruthlessly blunt: . . . puttings to it of the question of what the old New England spirit may have still, intellectually, aesthetically, or for that matter even morally, to give; of what may yet remain, for productive scraping, of the formula of the native Puritanism educated, the formula once capacious enough for the 'literary constellation' of the Age of Emerson. Is that cornucopia empty, or does some handful of strong or at least sound fruit lurk to this day, a trifle congested by keeping, up in the point of the horn?</page><page sequence="8">356 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Every question is a dagger thrust home, albeit with a velvet glove. Now that Americans are once again worrying over what their universities actually do James's prescience still goes further than most contemporary critics: The old formula, that of Puritanism educated, has it, in fine, except for 'business', anything more to communicate? -or do we perhaps mistake the case in still speaking, by reason of the projected shadow of Harvard, of 'education' as at all involved? The devastating casualness of that 'even morally' and the reduction of Harvard to an ominous 'shadow' cast a searchlight on the relation of the American university to American life that most academics have preferred to ignore. James's object was not, however, mere peace of mind. He could face up to the fact that the past he wished to commemorate might be a 'sell'. Had New England's material progress since Emerson's day been paid for by the extinction of precisely that 'spirit' which New England had stood for? James could ask questions like this because of his unique mixture of closeness to and distance from this sort of American society. He had never been an uncritical 'Puritan' himself, as the fiction he set in America amply shows, but he had valued the way Puritanism had helped to constitute a coherent and ordered social fabric, knitting its members together through its shared moral touchstones. This is why he praises Concord for having so much richer associations, though a village, than most American cities did. The culture created by Puritanism was thin - painfully so to a writer who had been to London and Paris and Venice -but it was a culture. All 'business' could create, even with the 'shadow of Harvard' behind it, was a plutocracy.4 He could feel wistful over Concord, even if he found it parochial, whereas most of the cities left him with only a jumble of sharp impressions that would never come together as a whole. In fact, Concord was one of the very few places in America where James really felt that he had touched something authentically American. Even the Confederate South, in Richmond, seemed vague and blurred in comparison. Unlike so many of the America Firsters of the younger generation, writers like Van Wyck Brooks who blamed him for deserting his own country, and unlike Whitman soldiering down his 'open road' with his eyes on the stars, James could only find this real America in 4 A reader who had already given careful attention to The Princess Casamassima would not be surprised to find how close James gets sometimes to the position of the William Morris of the socialist lectures. It is not easy to say which of them damns his culture most roundly. The myth of James as the spokesman for the 'better sort' surely applies not to him but to what some of his readers like to think he was.</page><page sequence="9">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 357 the past.5 It was painfully clear to him that all any future America would do would be to betray it. Like Spencer Brydon, in The Jolly Corner , he had seen the future but he had also seen that it didn't work. James might easily have attributed this paucity of social forms -from which his expatriation had itself been a reaction - to the levelling effects of democracy, as de Tocqueville had done earlier, but the main criticisms of The American Scene are directed, not against Whitman's 'en masse ' but at the American new rich. Poor Americans, such as the anonymous new emigrants, are always seen as individuals in the book whereas wealthy ones merely figure as a faceless class. It was to them and their money that he traced the moral and visual greyness he encountered everywhere, even in the leisure-culture of Palm Beach where some idiosyncracy might have been expected: It was the scant diversity of type that left me short, as a story- seeker or picture-maker; contributive as this very fact might be to admiration of the costly processes, as they thus appear, that ensure, and that alone ensure, in other societies, the opposite of that scantness. It is very like the America of The Europeans which the Baroness finds so hard to grasp.6 Like her, James bemoans: . . . the positive bourgeois propriety, serenely, imperturbably, massively seated, and against which any experimental deviation from the bourgeois would have dashed itself in vain. This neutrality of respectability might have been figured by a great grey wash of some charged moist brush causing colour and outline, on the pictured paper, effectually to run together. He could not have deployed such imagery when he wrote The Europeans but it ought not to mislead us into taking his criticism as mainly aesthetic, a question of taste. In this context, taste entails moral and political criticism too. It also enables him to identify the most potent 'types' of this new 'grey' America, the skyscrapers and luxury hotels which have superseded the homesteads and steeples of New England: blatant monuments to a world of characterless money, concourses where everybody meets and no one comes together. James could be very funny at their expense but they filled him with dismay because they no longer seemed to make up an environment which corresponded to any human scale. 5 See Brooks's The Pilgrimage of Henry James (1925), one of the earliest books on him and one of the most wrong-headed. 6 The famous catalogue of the deficiencies of Hawthorne's America which James wrote in 1879 is too often neutralised as a comic set-piece. The crucial point is that every word of it might have been written about the Palm Beach he visited forty years later.</page><page sequence="10">358 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY To like the Waldorf-Astoria would have been to sacrifice a part of his identity to its sheer, flaunted size. His rejection is all the more decisive, moreover, because one does not usually think of him as someone who feared or distrusted the future, like so many European novelists of his time. His characters welcome what comes next with as much expectant curiosity as those of, say, Hardy dread and suspect it as a bringer of gloom. In this respect, James was after all an American himself. It was only that particular future which appalled him. It offered no purchase to the 'restless analyst' and left him unemployed, his intelligence consigned to the margins of the national life. The mixture of amusement and shock which James felt about such things as the Waldorf-Astoria was not, of course, something new in his work. It was already there in Roderick Hudson , in Mr Leavenworth, the precursor of a long line of comic rich Americans in his fiction right down to Waymarsh in The Ambassadors . He had long predicted the America of 1904, even if the sheer scale of what had happened came as a shock. But it would, in any case, be misleading to dwell only on the things in America that shocked him. It is constantly apparent from the book's tone, which is at least as much affectionate as horrified, that James wanted to admire America and to seize every chance it gave him for wonder. He was too dazzled by it to condescend or act the returned 'European' pulling cultural rank (something that has always been distressingly easy for Europeans to do in America). Instead, he made a kind of springboard of his ignorance of what the country had become and took it as a licence to question and imagine, but never just accept, what he saw. Hence, his anxiety to avoid received ideas and to follow apparently un-Jamesian strategies like the long walks he took in the poorest parts of New York. Much more than simple observation was involved in this. The American Scene has a rich vein of autobiography which keeps breaking through and it repays reading together with James's formal Autobiography , written a few years later. Thus, he dramatised his ambivalent status as an expatriate for all it was worth: it too was a fact to observe, not simply a vantage from which to observe. That is, he made no claims to the barren and unimaginative virtue of objectivity. He did not, at this late date, see himself as an American Zola. It was therefore part of his approach to dramatise his own parti pris as a traveller, since this counted so much in the interests of the 'restless analyst'. I have evoked this bias more than once, his fondness for the old New England, the plangent moods he finds there as a relief from the brazenness of the present. This note is more sophisticated than it looks, of course, because James always spoke of New England, however tenderly, as a New Yorker. In The American Scene his evocations of it serve a deliberate strategy for approaching the present. They are not there for</page><page sequence="11">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 359 sentimental or confessional purposes, as may at first appear. And as a foil to the world of the Waldorf-Astoria his Salem and Concord serve his critical turn. But this does not mean that they provide him with a complete idea of what America might have been. They may seem pristine in retrospect but they lack the true American vitality which was always so important to James. He needs his poetic New England but he refuses to equate it with either America itself or with the New England he had represented in The Europeans. This is why he takes no care to protect his poetry from historical criticism. Had he wanted, he could have supplied that himself. We are, in fact, quite at liberty to question James's version of the past, just as we are free to question his account of the present. Given his own faith in the value of 'continuity' in a society, he may even have wanted us to ask whether old New England had not already had latent in it the seeds of the America he himself felt so at sea in. (Melville would have thought so.) How could the future be anything other than the consequence of the past? America may have denied history but surely James couldn't do so? I would argue that the weak spot of The American Scene is indeed that it is unhistorical about this past but not in this way. The real trouble lies in its subscribing to the myth of its innocence. For the Puritans had lost their innocence long before, as Hawthorne had realised. What James mistook for it in places like Newport was only a kind of insulated social exclusiveness. Beside the socially indiscriminate affluence of modern America it looked like innocence. The latter must therefore be an aberration and a fall from this past. On class grounds it was a predictable distortion for James to favour. Furthermore, it gave him something to set against the West and the South -small pockets of native civilisation which enabled him to let New England stand for America herself. It both brought back and isolated for him the country of the Founding Fathers in the age of the Robber Barons. There is no doubt that James badly needed to keep these two Americas apart, in separate places in his mind. Yet he must have known that this was wishful thinking and that, if the one had not conducted to the other, there would have been no Civil War. It was the 'innocent' America which brought forth the fallen one, just as the Crusaders had brought the Black Death back from the Holy Land. Nonetheless, James certainly knew that his New England was in part a fiction. Both The Bostonians and his bitter analysis of 'the Puritan residuum' make it plain that he was never dewy-eyed about it. The sentiment was partly tactical, good ammunition to use on the skyscrapers of New York. Ironists as feline as the late James are rarely sentimental without an ulterior purpose. No doubt he himself would have said that America twisted one's sensibility into strange shapes.</page><page sequence="12">360 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY But this too, on its own, makes a false emphasis. The American Scene goes far beyond sentiment and, by the end, its benignant tone is transformed into one of brutal accusation. No American can ever have liked to think of America like this: . . . your pretended message of civilisation is but a colossal recipe for the creation of arrears, and of such as can but remain forever out of hand. You touch the great lonely land -as one feels it still to be- only to plant upon it some ugliness about which, never dreaming of the grace of apology or contrition, you then proceed to brag with a cynicism all your own. You convert the large and noble sanities that I see around me, you convert them one after the other to crudities, to invalidities, hideous and unashamed; and you so leave them to add to the number of the myriad aspects you simply spoil, of the myriad unanswerable questions that you scatter about as some monstrous unnatural mother might leave a family of unfathered infants on doorsteps or in waiting-rooms. This gets its formidable punch not least from its wit, from the extra- ordinary 'metaphysical' fancy of America as an 'unnatural mother'. It is a conjectural image, tempered by both irony and horror, not a direct statement, but no less disturbing even so. Nevertheless, it is too creative to be called disillusioned and it clearly springs from the patriot in James, not from cynicism. It simply expresses the kind of patriotism that nine patriots out of ten want to ignore. Not many people want to see their country as it is. Yet James does still see America as a mother, though a bad one, and even in this denunciation he is careful to distinguish between what it has become and what it really is, 'the great lonely land', so evocative of Fenimore Cooper's America, that even now, as so often before, might still redeem us. James's feelings went deeper than violence and horror but they needed to go through them. His tenderness for American 'innocence', the other side of the equation, could not teach him so much on its own. What James would have had to say about present-day America will hardly bear thinking of but it would not have been reductive. The American Scene is finally a salutary book. Its author is not to blame if the sores for which he brought his scalpel are still unlanced. America has ignored its good-fortune in having such a book. There has been nothing half as probing written about England in this century, which has been England's loss and one that England has paid for. In the circumstances, our best course is to apply The American Scene to ourselves since it foresaw our future too. It has given us more to do than to feel sorry for America or alarmed only on its account. It is one of the classic accounts of what it is like to</page><page sequence="13">DECIPHERING AMERICA: THE AMERICAN SCENE 361 discover that you no longer know what your country is or where it is going to and, as such, it rings bells for Europeans too. To feel one's nationality not as a flag but as a problem is not just an American dilemma. No one has ever pretended that it is an easy book to read, as most travel books try to be, but that is because James was too honest to pretend to be clear in print about things that were by no means clear to him in life. When he was back in Rye, at the end of 1905, he told his friend Paul Bourget of how much trouble he was having in turning his 'impressions' of America into a book: ... to pluck them of their feathers and turn them up properly and serve them at table. I came back, in short, a victim in all ways to the immense incoherence of American things. It has taken all the intervening period of American history for us to see why this was so, why he could not write about America as he had written about Italy or England in Italian Hours and English Hours. He had to write with one pained eye on the future, on the look-out for what would come next. Luckily, he had a bird's eye view of it, such as neither Dickens nor Trollope had had in their account of America. By 1904 James had friends in high places and there was even a dinner in his honour in the presence of the President. Though flattered, he still looked askance at Teddy Roosevelt's millionaire cronies and regretted the much simpler institution which the Presidency had been in the past, when its holder could be seen walking about Washington like any other citizen. The vacuum created by America's destruction of its own past was clearly going to be filled by the new money he had felt affronted by at Newport and New Jersey. No doubt he could also have foretold a time when Presidents would only open their mouths in order to say what that money told them to. To imagine the 'immense incoherence' of that America we need only remind ourselves of what it feels like to drive into so many American towns today, the unending ribbon of motels and garages and bars that seem to lead to no centre, no community beyond themselves. What puzzles James has puzzled countless travellers since: where and what is America? None of this should make an English reader feel superior or lucky. James's America is no longer a 'foreign country' and neither is 'the wench dead', any more than a Macdonald' s in a cathedral city is dead. It may even be where the life is. Had James lived long enough he would have been able to witness many of the things he saw in America without leaving England. They are now 'home' to us too.7 For James left it to a later 7 Readers of Jonathan Raban's Coasting , a vivid record of a voyage around England undertaken in a similar spirit to The American Scene , will understand how easy it is to be English in England and yet feel like a foreigner. This thought</page><page sequence="14">362 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY generation to assemble his American jig-saw. If The American Scene is a 'prose poem', as Auden famously claimed, this is not because it is descriptive and decorative, though it can be, but because its every word is fired with analysis and speculation. Unlike so many Americans, then and now, it never takes the nature of America for granted. This is the only way to love a country.8 Whether Americans will thank James for such love, now that the Presidency has once more been jostled for by the speech-writers and the advertising men, is another matter. As Ginsberg's poem to Walt Whitman goes on: Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage- teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe? Whitman himself never understood that smoky view, he clung too much to America's innocence to see through such blackness, but Henry James did and he sent back his report from the front for those prepared to read it. David Gervais strikes Raban most when he gets to Rye and wonders if England has become one vast museum, so 'English' that he no longer feels at home in it. He knows, of course, that the difference between Rye and Milton Keynes is as wide as that between Concord and Palm Beach but, even so, he still wonders if he should not choose Milton Keynes. We may not go this far but we are still much more likely to share Raban' s attitude than to take refuge in the kind of myth of 'England' that Forster could still call on in Howard's End. The virtue of Raban' s book is that he doesn't try to make his England add up. Coasting was published by Collins Harvill in 1986 and is now also available in a Picador paperback. 8 The one later American writer whom one thinks of as taking on this task and bringing something of James's force to it is, of course, Edmund Wilson. A natural place to go on to from The American Scene would be his book about the stockmarket crash, The American Jitters. Nearer James's own time one thinks of the even more uncompromising Thoreau. For example, the denunciation of the Gold Rush in his Journal for 1852: 'Of what significance the philosophy, or poetry, or religion of a world that will rush to the lottery of California gold-digging on the receipt of the first news, to live by luck . . .'</page></plain_text>
