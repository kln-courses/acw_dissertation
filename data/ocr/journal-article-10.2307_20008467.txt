(Downers Grove IL: InterVarsity Press, 2001), (Carlisle: Paternoster, 2001). Pp. 221. ISBN o 8308 2652 1 (USA), 1 84227 160 1 (UK). This is a volume of new essays on the topic of divine foreknowledge, concentrating on the age-old question of whether it is compatible with human freedom. The contributors are all evangelical Christians: Gregory A. Boyd, for merly of Bethel College, represents 'open theism'; David Hunt of Whittier College argues for 'simple foreknowledge'; William Lane Craig from the Talbot School of Theology writes from a Molinist perspective, and Paul Helm of Regent College, Vancouver, gives the Calvinist line. The book seems to be aimed at under graduates and the intelligent lay person, but graduate students and scholars will also appreciate the clear statements of each position. Each author writes a chapter varying from twenty-five to thirty-nine pages in length, and then writes for every other chapter a five-page response. In the 'companion volume' God and Time: Four Views (featuring two of the same contributors), each author then replies to the replies. This makes for a longer, but in some ways more satisfying, book. Although the obvious way to read the book is linearly, the reader might be better off reading each of the main essays first and then working through the replies. One reason for this is that often the authors in their replies refer to what they have said in their main essays. Boyd, who opens the book after a brief introduction by the editors, is a theo logian rather than a philosopher, and his chapter, which sits rather un comfortably with the other three, tends to eschew philosophical argument for exegesis of biblical texts. His central thesis is that 'the reality that God perfectly knows not only excludes some possibilities as what might have been, but also includes other possibilities as what might be. Reality, in other words, is composed</page><page sequence="2">242 Book reviews of both settled and open aspects' (14). Boyd never explains in detail what this means, but seems to think that future contingent propositions lack a truth-value. His essay is divided into three parts: in the first he argues that the Bible does not teach that 'the future is exhaustively controlled or foreknown as settled by God' (14, italics original); in the second he argues that the Bible 'depicts the future as partly open and known by God as such' (14); and in the third part he defends his view against objections. In the first part, he insists that one may not infer from the many examples in the Bible of God's foreknowing some future event that He foreknows every future event. What baffles this reader is that Boyd is happy to affirm, for example, that Jesus foreknew that Peter would deny him and that Judas would betray him. These look like classic examples of what Boyd says is impossible: the infallible foreknowledge of future free actions. Boyd's explanation of these instances does not convince: he says ... the Father knew and revealed to Jesus one solidified aspect of Peter's character that was predictable in the immediate future. Any one who knew Peter's character perfectly could have predicted that under certain highly pressured circumstances (which God could easily orchestrate if he needed to), Peter would act the way he did. (20) Did Peter's character really determine him so precisely that he would betray Jesus three times before the cock crowed? As for Judas, Boyd denies that 'Jesus knew who would betray him from a time before the person decided' (21), answering the objection 'What if Judas had freely chosen not to betray Jesus?' by saying 'In this case the Lord would have found someone else to fill this role' (22). He does not consider the objection 'What if everybody had freely chosen not to betray Jesus?'. Boyd sums up his strategy by saying 'These passages only require us to believe that, when he so chooses, God can narrow the parameters within which certain people act out their freely chosen character' (22). The second part of Boyd's essay is devoted to discussing Bible passages that he claims talk of 'God's creative flexibility in responding to open aspects of his creation' (23). Boyd finds six major instances of this theme: 'God confronts the unexpected' (24), 'God experiences regret' (26),' God expresses frustration' (28), 'God speaks in conditional terms' (30), 'God tests people "to know" their character' (31), and 'God changes his mind' (33). Boyd claims that his 'openness' approach is superior to the other approaches in that they must take the passages he quotes non-literally, whereas he takes, he claims, both these passages and the ones giving examples of infallible definite foreknowledge literally. Boyd never considers that there might be other literal interpretations of his texts: for in stance, every single one could be interpreted literally, but as denying middle knowledge rather than foreknowledge. His refrain here is 'if God can't convince us by explicitly saying he can and does change his mind, experience regret and so on, how could he convince us if he wanted to?' (38, italics original). An answer to</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 243 this question that Boyd doesn't consider is 'By not including passages suggesting that he cannot change his mind and so on'. In the final part of his essay, he considers five objections, first that 'the passages used to support the openness view are anthropomorphic and phenomenological' (37), secondly that 'the openness view contradicts Scripture' (40), thirdly that 'the openness view undermines God's omniscience' (42), fourthly that 'the openness view undermines God's sovereignty' (43) and fifthly that 'the openness view is discomforting' (45). A final problem for Boyd is that he holds that God is in time, free (conceived in a libertarian manner), and can change His mind. Hence God cannot know what He will freely do tomorrow. Furthermore, God is still, for Boyd, omnipotent. So God can freely destroy the universe tomorrow and, presumably, cannot know whether or not He will. So God cannot know even whether there will be a universe tomorrow. To avoid this, Boyd will have to maintain that God cannot change His mind in many respects. Hunt defends the traditional doctrine that God has infallible, exhaustive, and definite foreknowledge against three arguments: the argument that such fore knowledge and freedom are incompatible ('the problem of human freedom'), the argument that God's having such foreknowledge is incompatible with His being a personal, intentional agent ('the problem of divine agency'), and the argument that God's having such foreknowledge does not help His providential government of the world ('the problem of divine providence'). This last hardly falsifies the doctrine, but it has nevertheless been defended in the literature. Hunt gives four arguments for the claim that God has such foreknowledge: first a Biblical one, secondly from the claim that God is a perfect being, thirdly from divine sover eignty, and fourthly from Christian tradition. He admits that these arguments are not absolutely compelling, but insists that they may not be just ignored either. To solve the first problem he uses what he claims is Augustine's way out - ar guing that it is possible that our future actions be both accidentally necessary and free. Hunt draws a parallel here between the freedom-foreknowledge arguments and Zeno's arguments against motion, claiming that in each case we can say that the arguments are bad even though we cannot say why: 'there is something fishy about the idea that Adam's action, while in every other respect satisfying the most exacting requirements for free will, might nevertheless count as unfree simply because God foreknew what he would do' (8i, italics original). This seems to get things the wrong way round: it is not that God's foreknowledge makes a future action unfree, it is that it is impossible to foreknow free actions. Hunt then writes ... the mere absence of alternate possibilities is irrelevant. Causing, forcing or coercing someone interferes with that person's agency; simply knowing what the person will do is not an interference of any sort, and its implications for free agency are benign ... Divine foreknowledge deprives Adam of alternatives, but we just can't believe that it deprives him of free will. (88)</page><page sequence="4">244 Book reviews It is not clear, however, that he has satisfied even his own intuitions that there is something fishy about the argument: many readers will find that they just cannot believe that divine foreknowledge deprives Adam of alternatives. As for the problem of divine agency, Hunt claims that while it is necessary that God have intentions, it is not necessary that He acquire them, and, further, that fore knowledge gives one merely a propositional belief about what will happen, whereas 'what one comes to believe as a result of intention-acquisition is a practical belief about what to do' (95, italics original). Hunt then turns to the problem of divine providence, rejecting the suggestion that God's acting on the basis of his foreknowledge necessarily leads to an explanatory circle. William Lane Craig defends the Molinist view that God has middle knowledge (the knowledge for every libertarianly free agent of what that agent would freely do in every circumstance), presenting three arguments: one biblical, one theo logical, and the last philosophical. In the theological argument Craig dis tinguishes between the question of whether exhaustive, definite, and infallible foreknowledge is compatible with freedom (conceived in a libertarian manner) and the question of how God knows future contingents. Craig complains that the view that such foreknowledge and such freedom are incompatible 'posits a con straint on human freedom that is unintelligible' (129). Like Hunt's remarks, this misses the point; the claim is not that such foreknowledge causes or somehow makes the foreknown actions not free, but that it is impossible infallibly to fore know a free action (conceived in a libertarian manner). Craig then argues that the claim that God's past beliefs are temporally or accidentally necessary boils down either to the claim that they are unalterable, or to the claim that they are outside our causal power. In response he points out that the future is unalterable too, and, while the past is outside our causal power, he claims, it is not outside our counterfactual power, which is all we need to show the compatibility of exhaus tive, infallible, and definite foreknowledge with freedom (conceived in a liber tarian manner). Craig then turns to the question of how God knows future contingents, rejecting the 'perceptualist' model of divine belief in favour of the 'conceptualist' model, and claiming that God's foreknowledge is based on his knowledge of his own decree and his middle knowledge, which arises because 'God, being omniscient, simply discerns all the truths there are' (133). But if this is so, why does God not directly discern the future contingent truths, rather than taking an inferential detour via counterfactuals of freedom? Craig's final theo logical argument is concerned with divine providence: open theism is here too weak, Calvinism too strong, but Molinism just right. His first philosophical argument is that since there are true future contingents the openness theist has to substitute a new and unsatisfactory definition of omniscience. He then argues vigorously against the 'grounding objection' (that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom lack a truth-maker and, consequently, a truth-value), giving as examples many other propositions that he claims lack truth-makers in the same way.</page><page sequence="5">Book reviews 245 In his response to Lane Craig, Boyd styles himself a neo-Molinist. He does this because he claims that open theism 'expands the content of God's middle knowledge to include "might-counterfactuals"' (144). But Boyd later (147-148) says 'In the neo-Molinist view, there simply is no eternal settledness to libertarian free actions. There are only eternal possibilities of what they might or might nor do' - in other words, that there are no would-counterfactuals that are true of libertarianly free actions. It is therefore wrong to associate the word 'Molinism' with his position. Helm defends the 'Augustinian/Calvinist' view that God knows what we shall freely do tomorrow because He has (directly or indirectly) determined what we shall freely do tomorrow. Helm is thus a compatibilist concerning freedom and determinism, though he is an incompatibilist concerning divine foreknowledge and free will, conceived in a libertarian manner. Helm presents three arguments for the view that Christianity requires a compatibilist view of free will, the first of which starts from the assumption that God's grace is essentially efficacious since we are incapable of responding to God without it. Since we don't have the power to respond to God or to reject His grace, says Helm, we don't have a will that is free on a libertarian view. This seems a bit quick; why shouldn't it be that we have freedom as libertarians think of it in other areas (e.g. how to sin) but just not to respond to or reject God? His second argument is 'for the consistency of divine foreknowledge and human compatibilist freedom from the idea of divine per fection and the principle of simplicity' (162). This is strangely put: nobody doubts that the view that God has definite, exhaustive, and infallible foreknowledge is consistent with the view that humans have freedom if freedom is compatible with determinism. Moreover, considerations of divine perfection and simplicity do not so much motivate an argument for their consistency as for their joint truth, their consistency being deduced from this. Helm, in fact, spends most of this section arguing that God, by efficaciously permitting evil actions, can foreknow them without causing them, and he likens the difference between God's causation and His permission to the difference between an action and an omission. Since, on Helm's view, God set up the laws that determine what will happen if something is omitted and the initial causes that lead to that outcome, it seems that this dis tinction is of no moral relevance. Helm also claims that a compatibilistic account of freedom is simpler, since it is more in line with the determinism that confronts us in the rest of nature, though he does acknowledge in a footnote the possibility of physical indeterminism on the quantum scale. Helm's third argument is for the conclusion that the view that God has definite, exhaustive, and infallible fore knowledge is not consistent with the view that humans have a freedom that is incompatible with determinism, using the traditional route of the accidental necessity of God's foreknowledge being transmitted to the foreknown action. (It might have been better to couch this entirely in terms of forebelief rather than foreknowledge.)</page><page sequence="6">246 Book reviews The glossary is reasonably helpful, though the entries under 'backtracking counterfactual', 'fatalism', and 'Fixed Past Principle' are misleading.
