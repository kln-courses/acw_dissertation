<plain_text><page sequence="1">The American Crow and the Common Raven.- Lawrence Kilham. 1989. College Station, Texas, Texas A&amp;M University Press. xiv + 255 pp., 13 black-and- white illustrations by Joan Waltermire, 17 sonograms, 1 text figure, 8 tables. ISBN 0-89096-327-0. $29.50.- This book is a deeply personal account of the author's six-year immersion in crow social life. Kilham and his wife were able to observe many nuances of ter- ritorial behavior and communal breeding by regu- larly feeding two territorial groups of crows in Flor- ida. Interspersed with discussions of possible cooperation are anecdotes on caching behavior, vocal- izations, predator deterrence, and cognitive abilities of wild and hand-reared crows in Florida and New Hampshire. Kilham aims to "make a study of all as- pects of crow behavior" and to that end dwells on crows, devoting only 45 pages to his studies of captive and hand-reared ravens. Kilham's work is a testament to the importance of amateurs to ornithology (Professionally he is a virol- ogist). The research summarized in this book is an important documentation of group territoriality and foraging and communal nesting by American Crows. Unfortunately, possible influences of supplemental feeding on territoriality are not discussed. The results from Florida, Cape Cod, and Los Angeles (which are briefly summarized) suggest that American Crows are much more social than previously appreciated. Crow groups may include up to seven auxiliaries that help a dominant pair breed. Kilham's claim that their com- munal breeding is "more highly developed ... than in any bird north of Mexico," however, is certainly an overestimate of their sociality. Kilham supplements our knowledge of crow and raven natural history. In particular, he observed a great variety in foraging behavior including group attacks on deer fawns and a swan nest. Cooperative foraging may be common in Florida, where members of crow groups often flushed insects out of cabbage palms to other group members. His documentation of extensive caching and the possible use of caches by incubating females is also important. He is quick</page><page sequence="2">January 1990] Reviews 231 to point out the extreme shyness that ravens (even a hand-reared one) exhibit at food, which was also de- tailed by Heinrich (1988, Condor 90: 950). In contrast to other accounts, Kilham did not observe crows act- ing as sentinels for ravens. Instead he reports that ravens dominate crows and may rob them of food. Quantification of time budgets, reproductive success, and relative composition of diet are notably lacking. The vocal repertoire of crows and ravens is leg- endary. Kilham presents several sonograms of inter- esting vocalizations and suggests their function. Function is difficult to ascribe because he did no play- back experiments, nor did he quantify the use of calls in a variety of contexts. Mysteriously, the extensive work on crow calls by Brown (1985, Z. Tierpsychol. 67: 17) is not discussed (her work on crow song is only briefly mentioned). Kilham's novel interpretations of behavior should fuel further research on crows. His insight is rarely influenced by preexisting literature, which leads to original, although sometimes anthropomorphic, speculations about rare observations. For example, he feels that crows bombard predators and competitors with vocalizations in an effort to repel them or force them to abandon their catches. They may also try to deceive hawks by luring them with imitations of prey, perhaps attempting to frustrate potential competitors. These ideas are pretty farfetched, but they are testable and if confirmed would go far in supporting claims of the superior cognitive abilities of crows and ravens. Kilham's book succeeds as a collection of interest- ing observations, but it falls short as a scientific study. Discussions are primarily lists of studies supporting or in conflict with his observations. Rarely are there in-depth discussions of current theories and how var- ious observations support or refute them. Kilham openly deplores statistics in his introduction and re- ports no statistics more complex than a mean (without a measure of variation). Without quantification, his statements must be confined to the few individuals he studied. Moreover, the text often presents disjoint- ed anecdotes instead of quantified ideas and tests of hypotheses. At times Kilham seems to have gone out of his way to avoid experimentation. For example, his hand-reared crow appeared to mob a black bathing suit hanging on a nearby clothesline (supporting Lo- renz's famous claim), yet Kilham never systematically presented objects to his pets to test this (or any) idea. I was often frustrated by exciting observations like this that lacked rigorous investigation. My most serious criticism is that many of Kilham's claims are suspect because he refused to mark his study animals. He justifies this approach by suggest- ing that color marking hinders observations because one is more concerned with reading bands rather than watching behavior. He also feared that his subjects would remember the trauma of banding and forever label him as their enemy. A last concern is that color bands may influence mate choice. These are real, but by no means insurmountable, concerns. The infor- mation gained in recent long-term studies of marked populations suggests that the benefits far outweigh the detriments. Although Kilham alludes to the ben- efits of marking, he relied on natural markers rather than artificial bands. He suggests that individuals were recognized by noting individualistic deformities, vocalizations, and the presence of broken or bent feathers. These may be reliable cues to identity, but I doubt they are as permanent as the author claims (he identified the "same" bird by a broken feather for two years). Paradoxically, Kilham later suggests that crows themselves may have difficulty identifying individuals at a distance because of their uniformly black plumage. Yet we are expected to believe that he could. Without reliably marked individuals, it is difficult to evaluate many claims about crow group composition and territoriality. We really do not know that the "groups" of crows included the same indi- viduals from day to day. The chapter on the evolution of crow communal breeding is especially weak. Kilham suggests (with- out supporting data) that habitats are saturated, that parents with helpers raise more young and have more time to devote to other activities than parents without helpers, and that helpers gain experience useful in the future. These are likely, but data on time budgets and reproductive success of many pairs are needed. The importance (or lack thereof) of indirect genetic benefits are not discussed, and Hamilton's (1964, J. Theor. Biol. 7: 1) seminal work is not mentioned. Oc- casionally, Kilham waxes "group-selectionist" as he does when explaining that helping and delaying re- production are not costly in long-lived species like crows because populations will not suffer. This book is supposed to "appeal to professional and amateur ornithologists," but it is likely to appeal to amateurs more than professionals. Amateurs will certainly enjoy his stories of interesting behaviors and exploits with pet corvids. The illustrations are wonderful and Kilham's insights into crow and raven sociality are important. However, most ornithologists are likely to tire of wading through disjointed, often repetitive, tales. Those interested in corvids, caching, foraging, and communal breeding, however, should look at this book. I recommend this book for com- munity and university libraries, but few researchers will find it essential for their personal libraries. Perhaps the greatest contribution that this book makes to ornithology is to point out how important it is to mark birds. My immediate feeling upon read- ing the text was a desire to rush out and color-band crows! So much more could have been learned if Kil- ham's crows wore color bands. Nonetheless, Kilham has added much to our knowledge of these common but understudied birds. His take-home message is important to professionals as well as amateurs: crows are "intelligent, resourceful, and cooperative," not simple-minded robots.-JOHN MARZLUFF.</page></plain_text>
