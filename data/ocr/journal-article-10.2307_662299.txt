<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SOVIET UNION By HENRY FIELD AND EUGENE PROSTOV INTRODUCTION T HIS article, dealing primarily with the results of archaeological ex- peditions during 1935-1936, supplements the two previous reports in the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST.1 In compiling these data special efforts were made to secure the more recent results obtained by expeditions men- tioned in our previous article and also to procure information from new areas, particularly Siberia. The general arrangement of the material has been treated geographically under the headings Georgia and Abkhazia, Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Daghestan, North Caucasus, Crimea and Black Sea Region, Ukraine, European Russia, Turkestan, and Siberia. In order to facilitate the location of sites the former as well as the modern names have been added. The maps, drawn at Field Museum by Richard A. Martin and published in our previous report, can also be utilized. Soviet literature in the libraries of Field Museum of Natural History and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago were examined by Eugene Prostov, who selected many passages for inclusion and supervised the transliterations.2 V. N. Rimsky-Korsakoff selected material from the Soviet publications in the library of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. In August, 1936, A. M. Tallgren3 published two important articles in Eurasia Septentrionalis Antiqua.

For example, during 1935 GAIMK4 organized seventeen expeditions which were con- ducted by ninety-three members of its staff. In addition to its own ex- peditions GAIMK cooperated with the following: (1) the Altai Expedition of IAE; (2) the Lower Volga Expedition of IAE; (3) the Sukhum Expedi- tion of IAE; (4) the Tripolie Expedition of ANU. During the past two years the staff of IAE5 has investigated numerous anthropological problems throughout the Soviet Union. The Institute is preparing for publication a reference handbook6 which will include brief data on the distribution, statistics, history, ethnography, and socialization of the population. The volume dealing with Central Asia is ready for print- ing, and materials have been collected for the northern Asiatic and Euro- pean sections of the U.S.S.R., and, to some extent, for the Caucasus. The most important project of the year, which dealt with the "genesis and development of the primitive communist society," included fifty theses on the prehistoric development of society based on archaeological data, ' Gosudarstvennaia Akademiia Istorii Material'nol Kul'tury imeni N.

The antiquities include dolmens with bronze objects of more archaic type than those of the Koban culture, comparable with those from the North Caucasus dated by A. V. Schmidt (ESA, Vol. 4, pp. 9-21) between 2300-1600 B.C.; urn burials, with Koban type of bronze inventory, associated with Greek and Hellenistic ceramics (sixth to second centuries B.C.); and stone circles of unknown date, locally known as "Dwarfs' fences" (Atsan-guara).</page><page sequence="4">460 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 39, 1937 tinued the archaeological survey begun in 1934. A geological expedition of the Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Mirchenko, Gromov, and Paretskil, cooperated. According to Zamiatnin,8 as a result of three months' work about twenty Paleolithic sites were discovered, representing mainly Acheulian, Clactonian, Levalloisian, and Mousterian types, while Upper Paleolithic implements were also excavated. Listed below are some of the new sites:9 Acheulian a. Byrts, southeast of Yasktukh Mountain b. Gvard, southeast of Byrts c. Apiancha Mountain, near Tsebelda, east of Sukhum d. Yagish Mountain, on left bank of Madzharkl River Mousterian a. Akhabiuk near Mikhailovskoe, north of Sukhum b. Kelasuri on Kelasuri River, five kilometers southeast of Sukhum c. Esheri, on right bank of Gumista River, seven kilometers west of Sukhum d. Okum, near railroad, seven kilometers southeast of Ochemchiri e. Chuburiskhindzhi, twelve kilometers southeast of Gali near Sandzhio Moun- tain In addition Lichkop, two kilometers north of Sukhum, contained Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic deposits. At Gali there were Acheulian, Mousterian, and Upper Paleolithic levels. The stations of Achikhvari, north of Ochemchiri, Kolkhida, five kilometers southeast of Gagry, and Barmish, fifteen kilometers east of Kolkhida, contained undetermined Paleolithic deposits. In many cases it was possible to establish the con- nection between the Paleolithic implements of various periods and the cor- responding sea terraces. At several sites, for the first time in the U.S.S.R., Lower Paleolithic coups-de-poing were found. 2. The Sukhum Expedition of GAIMK (A. A. Jessen, leader) discovered remains of Medieval settlements, fortifications, and burial grounds in the valleys of eastern and western Gumista. Two Bronze Age sites near Sukhum and Ochemchiri yielded textile-impressed pottery. In 1936 an expedition from Tiflis (Museum of Georgia ?) explored the remains of ancient settle- ments, discovered by GAIMK in 1935, which are to be demolished during construction of the port of Ochemchiri. Regions embracing the villages of Esheri and Yashtukh, near Azanta and around Lake Amtkel, were exam- ined. 8 In a letter dated June 28, 1936. g N. I. Berezin, Spravochnik po paleolitu S.S.S.R.

A plan for further exploration of that region was formulated and submitted to the Committee. 3. The Terek Expedition of GAIMK (A. P. Kruglov, leader) completed the exploration of the Terek Valley and continued in the area between Kazbek village and the confluence of the rivers Terek and Arm-Khi, in- cluding the ancient cemetery near Chmi. Fifty sites were studied, bringing the total since 1934 to about two hundred. A Medieval settlement, seventeen fortifications, fifteen burial groups, consisting of vaults and stone boxes, fifteen religious monuments including ten churches and five non-Christian sanctuaries, dating from the sixth to the fifteenth centuries, were investigated. Part of the Darial fortifications yielded dwellings built of roughly hewn stone, as well as many sherds, glass vessels, and animal bones. The greater number of the finds belonged to the ninth or tenth century. The interrelation of ancient fortifications nearby was also studied. 4. An expedition sponsored by the Georgian Geographical Society'o made ethnographical collections and explored the ancient monuments in the western part of the Caucasus range. The route of the expedition in- cluded the Ardon Valley, the Klot Pass, the Urtskh Basin, the Shtuluvtsekh Pass, the upper portion of the Cherekha River, the Sharivtsekh Pass, the Zagorskil Pass, Ingur, the tributaries of the Galizga River, and Sukhum. AZERBAIDZHAN During 1935 an expedition" from the Azerbaidzhan Branch of the Acad- emy of Sciences studied the ethnology of the former nomads, the Talyshs, Orans, and the Alars. Ancient burial monuments, "Shikh Zakeria" and "Dzhabir," near Larik village were investigated. Mountain Karabakh Autonomous Area.

S., 39, 1937 closely associated with the ancient region of Albania, was begun by N. Marr and Emil R6sler.13 The results were published as brief notes in the reports of the Imperial Archaeological Commission, 1892-1898. In 1926 the Society for the Study of Azerbaidzhan sent an expedition under the leadership of I. I. Meshchaninov to excavate the tumuli of the Khodzhalu area. Only a brief preliminary report was published by Meshchaninov;14 this led to the publication of R6isler's materials from Karabakh stored in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad." Ter-Avetisian, studying the distribution of the tumuli, found them from the northeast part of the Albanian (now Evlakh) plain south into the Karabakh region and also southward in the Khochen, Karkar, and Terter Valleys. The latter extend to Lake Sevan in southern Azerbaidzhan. Along the entire southern frontier of Azerbaidzhan there exists a chain of tumuli between Lake Sevan and Lenkoran. The Khochen Valley tumuli are concentrated in the Arachadzor region. The line of tumuli along the Karkar Valley goes through the Askeran Pass and part of Kurdistan,16 into the Zangezur region, and disappears near Karaklis. The most im- portant Bronze Age group of tumuli, partly excavated by R6sler in 1894, is near Khodzhalu village in the Karkar Valley. In general the tumuli, twenty-five to thirty meters in height, belong to the Hallstatt period, although some have been attributed to later periods up to the Urartian epoch. Meshchaninov (op. cit., p. 104) found five dis- tinct types of tumuli near Khodzhalu. In shape they do not differ from South Russian tumuli. In the Khochen Valley the tumuli are faced with large, unhewn stones. In Karabakh there were stone box burials containing skeletons associated with bronze, occasional flint, gold, and iron objects from Khodzhalu, Varanda, and Dashalti near Shusha.

Unpublished pottery is stored in the Hermitage and in the Moscow Historical Museum. The Khochen tumuli contained multiple burials, a skeleton in the center being surrounded by as many as eight flexed skeletons (of slaves ?). The bronzes from Karabakh tumuli are characterized by decorations using locally known animals. No influence of Assyrian art is discernible, as in southern Armenia.17 Virchow discerned in the Karabakh tumuli the sway of a northern culture which he termed North Khaldic industry. Ter-Avetisian thinks that a more precise term would be "Scythian." According to Rostovtsev'8 Transcaucasia was never isolated culturally from the North Caucasus and South Russia. The Scythian invasions of Albania were recorded by Herod- otus and Xenophon. Marr found Scythian elements in the geographical names of this area. According to Strabo, a Scythian tribe, the Sacae,19 conquered Bactria and invaded the choicest land of Armenia, which was named Sacassene [;aKaartl-vi] as a result. Further exploration of the Karabakh tumuli is anticipated to result in valuable contributions to the present knowledge of the Scythian problem. Nakhichevan.20 In the Nakhichevan Autonomous S.S.R., a subdivision of the Azerbaidzhan S.S.R., A. Alekperov of the Academy of Sciences in Baku has conducted several archaeological surveys, which were continued during May and June, 1936. A study of the painted pottery found in this area is now being prepared. Although there is no record of the stratifica- tion, the following sites have yielded painted pottery, according to the notes of Alekperov: Chahtakhti 390 22' N., 450 7' E.

On the most common form, a shallow bowl, a few broad stripes of red paint run down from the rim and intersect at the base. A similar piece of pottery,2' with only the rim painted, comes from Hasankale on the Aras in Turkey. A typical piece of wheel-made pottery from Nakhichevan and Armenia is illustrated by Frankfort.22 The same design appears on red-wash and wheel-finished ware. The schnabelkanne is also a popular form and closely related to the Iranian types. The same forms become almost exclusively black in the region nearer the Caucasus. Red painted ware has been found as far north as Zurnabad and a wet-smoothed schnabelkanne appeared in the Shirak steppe of eastern Georgia. ARMENIAn In 1936 the Institute of the History and Culture of Armenia in Erivan discovered what are believed to be Neolithic remains at Shungavit, a suburb to the south of Erivan, and at Muchannat-Thapa near the railroad station in Erivan. Both sites contained flint and bone tools and crude black pottery. At Muchannat-Thapa the Urartu period is also represented by some red painted pottery with black geometrical designs, molds, bronze knives and axe heads, and Urartu roll seals which are slightly tapered with the larger base cut for use as a stamp seal. In recent years Urartu cuneiform inscriptions have been found at the following places: Adyaman 400 8' N., 450 15' E. Aluchalu 400 8' N., 450 30' E. Elar 400 16' N., 440 38' E.

Bashkirov, leader)24 continued investigation of ancient monuments in southeastern Daghestan. Numerous fortifications, burial grounds, huge tumuli, etc., were examined in the vicinity of Derbent and parts of an ancient wall were excavated. A minaret of the fourteenth to fifteenth cen- turies in Darvag village, ruins of an ancient mosque near Zil', and burial grounds near Gemeidi, with keel-shaped tombstones, were studied. In the KaTtag-Tabasaran region were examined about eighty reliefs depicting lions, either attacking a wild boar, a deer, or some other animal, or two facing each other rampant. The expedition made a brief survey of many burial grounds and fortifications bearing reliefs and inscriptions, noting in many instances sculptured, "console-like" fragments on the turrets. One unique tombstone presented an eagle and two lions on the front, the figures surrounded by geometric ornamentation composed of different elements, while the back side was embellished with decorative designs and Arabic graffiti. In the Kala-Korelshsk mosque two doors bear plant and animal figures. Itsari village, built on the ruins of a castle, was investigated. Here a round, Medieval turret is well preserved. On the ancient structures, as well as in the newer buildings constructed from the material of the former, were found: (1) remains of engraved stone very similar to those discovered in the Avar and Andiisk regions in Daghestan in 1923; (2) reliefs of human and animal heads of the Amuzgi and mountain Chechnia type; (3) sculp- tured monuments similar to the Kubachinsk structures; (4) many ancient inscriptions. In the Makhach-Kala (former Petrovsk) region tumuli, fortifications, and numerous tombstones of peculiar shape with highly artistic ornamental designs were investigated. 24 A. S.

The excavation of a tumulus, begun in 1934, was continued in 1935. Some flexed burials were unearthed inside the tumulus above the level of the plain, while below were several others of the catacomb type. Both kinds of burial were also found in a smaller tumulus. Two catacomb burials with pottery of new shapes and types contained deformed crania, one of the children's graves having a human head modeled in red paint.

I. VeselovskiT, who thought it to be a Scythian tumulus. Among the specimens were gold and silver ornaments, bronze and iron objects, Panticapean copper coins, many clay vessels of various forms bearing Greek stamps, net and loom weights. There were also many remains of domesticated animals and fish. In the gorodishche the expedition unearthed an altar, pottery kilns, and stylized clay figurines of local manu- facture but copied apparently from Greek models. The round hill yielded restored dwellings of the fourth to third centuries B.C., of construction similar to modern Kuban houses since clay fragments bearing the im- pression of twigs and reeds were found. One clay fragment retained traces of white pigment. Among the fauna were the bones of a rooster. 3. The Mozdok Expedition of GAIMK (M. A. Miller, leader) explored Scytho-Sarmatian settlements and cemeteries in this region. CRIMEAa3 AND BLACK SEA REGION 1. The Crimean Expedition of IAE (S. N. Bibikov, leader) worked in cooperation with the Soviet Section of the International Association for the Study of the Quaternary Period. The Shan-Koba3n rock-shelter ex- cavations, begun in 1927, were continued. In 1935 three basic cultural horizons, yielding about eight hundred flint artifacts, were determined in this Azilian-Tardenoisian site. In addition were found a hoard of unworked flints in the sixth layer; a storeroom filled with snail shells (Helix vulgaris) in one of the lateral crevices of the shelter, and hearths at various levels. Of special note were several bone knife handles, scraper handles, etc. An ornamented knife handle was the first of this type ever found in the Soviet Union. Capsian affinities of the Crimea are demonstrated by comparing bone and stone implements from the lower layers of Shan-Koba with those of the upper horizons at Siuren, an Aurignacian grotto thirteen kilometers southwest of Bakhchisaral excavated from 1926-1929 by G. A. Bonch- Osmolovskil.32 Especially significant in this connection is the presence of nuclear types of flint implements and elongated blades. 30o See Iz istorii Bospora [Contribution to the History of Pontusj, a collection of articles published by GAIMK, 1935. 31 S.

During the summer of 1936 an expedition from IAE (S. N. Bibikov, leader) began an archaeological survey of the valley of the Chernaia River in the Sevastopol District. E. V. Zhirov, physical anthropologist, found two nearly complete "Cr6-Magnon" skeletons badly crushed under heavy stones near the entrance to the small cave of Murzak Koba. They were not buried in a pit. The male skeleton lacks only the left leg, the right tibia and fibula, and the phalanges. The following measurements and ob- servations were recorded:-" age 40-55; stature about 1800; undoubtedly dolichocephalic, although part of frontal bone absent; bizygomatic breadth 147; morphological face height 70; typical deep Cr6-Magnon notch at nasion; pronounced Cr6-Magnon type tibia, sharp and compressed later- ally; orbital height only 27; orbital breadth, very wide, 47; very heavy supra-orbital crests; superior oblique ridges on occiput; all teeth present but much worn, especially upper teeth, which were worn past pulp cham- ber in several instances; upper teeth nearly all abscessed, pyorrhea being present; and a distal occlusion of the upper jaw. The female skeleton appears to be complete except for part of each hand and foot. This young individual possessed orbits which were not so wide laterally in proportion to the vertical diameter. All teeth back to and including the first molar showed considerable signs of wear but the second molars showed very little wear and the third molars none at all. Although their food must have been abrasive this must have been eaten outside the cave where only remains of snails and fish were found. These skeletons were excavated from a rich cultural deposit containing stone and bone implements attributed to the Azilian-Tardenoisian period. At the woman's right hand lay a knife made of a rib of some large animal. Three bone harpoons were found near the skeletons. This is the second Crimean site containing human remains belonging to this transition period. Bonch-Osmolovskil uncovered a skeleton, neither Cr6-Magnon in type nor in manner of burial, buried in a pit in a crouching position. Since the deposits at Murzak Koba grew richer as the excavations proceeded, plans were made to continue work there during 1937. 3. The Kerch Expedition34 of GAIMK (L.

During 1935 six Roman tanks, with total capacity of about thirty-three cubic meters, constructed of close-fitting limestone slabs (180 by 180 by 15-25 centimeters), were found. The inner walls of the tanks were coated with a mixture of lime and sand and pulverized brick. All angle-joints and walls fitted well. The remains of stone walls and the mass of tile fragments indicate that the plant was probably sheltered by a tile roof. Compressed layers of small fish bones and scales, mainly of Kerch herring (Clupea caspialosa) were found in some of the tanks. Near a defensive wall, three meters thick, lay indications of economic life: fish-salting cisterns of the Roman period, millstones in a building of the early Middle Ages, a granary with wheat grains, animal bones, many coins, and painted pottery. At Myrmikia work was continued and two wineries discovered, each including a well, one of them with potable water. The exceptional strength of the concrete and the waterproof qualities of the coating were especially noted. The excavations, which will be continued during 1937, dis- closed Myrmikia in the role of a large wine-producing center of the Bosphorus. 4. The Olvia (Olbia)37 Expedition of GAIMK (F. A. KozubovskiT, L. M. Slavin, F. N. MolchanovskiT, leaders) was sponsored by GAIMK and ANU. The staff consisted of twenty-six members, including archaeologists, architects, a geologist, an artist, a chemical expert, and an osteologist. This site was one of the most important Black Sea colonies. The excava- tion of an entire city quarter of the Hellenistic period was completed, as well as the main street leading from the city gate to the port. The northern defensive wall was explored disclosing a hundred meter clay substructure of the city wall. Many objects attributed to the Greek and Roman periods were brought to light. Seven hundred square meters of the harbor area were examined, especially a Roman stratum, two to three meters in depth. Two large buildings, one of them a bakery, were unearthed. Two Roman vaults excavated in the necropolis yielded a golden wreath, buckles, golden earrings, etc. 5.

In 1935 the Sarkel Expedition of GAIMK (M. I. Artamonov, leader) continued excavations in the Khazar city of Sarkel on the Don near Tsimlianskaia. Beside the river were uncovered houses and storage pits which yielded many important objects including a bone tool with a carved vulture's head, metal buckles, sickles, axes, and other implements, many sherds, and several complete jars. North of the city the upper stratum was removed over an area of 200 square meters and a trench was sunk to bed' rock. Remains of buildings with brick ovens, mud walls and floors con- taining straw and more ancient crushed baked brick were uncovered. The latest period of this settlement dates to the twelfth century. Nine small tumuli with horse burials and a large tumulus used as a sepulcher for 124 individuals were excavated. Objects from this large eleventh century tumulus included earrings, pendants, crosses, beads, small bells, buckles, textile fragments, daggers, etc. In a Bronze Age site near Krasnyi IAr, five kilometers from Sarkel, was found a mud hut pitted for roof poles, a fireplace, many sherds, flint and bone tools including a perfect harpoon and several blunt awls, tupik, a bronze awl, and a small chisel. 3. The Western Province (Oblast) Expedition of IAE (K. M. Polikar- povich,43 leader) continued excavation of the Magdalenian site of Elisee- vichi, on the right bank of the Sudost' River, forty-five kilometers west- southwest of Briansk and fifty kilometers east of Mglin. The station is situated in a loess deposit contemporaneous with a lower terrace of the Upper Dnieper region. Twenty thousand worked flints were collected. Under a pile of mammoth tusks were found a fifteen centimeter female figurine differing considerably in style from any existing Paleolithic "Venus," a representation of a fish, and fifteen oval tablets of mammoth ivory, the latter delicately engraved with complicated designs. For the first time a significant series of Magdalenian art objects was placed in the hands of Soviet scholars. The fauna included Elephas primigenius, Canis lupus, Vulpes sp. (?lagopus), etc. The finds were divided between the Museum of the White Russian Academy of Sciences in Minsk and the IAE Museum in Leningrad. 4. The Kama Expedition of GAIMK (N. A.

Schmidt," was exhausted. Turbino, however, yielded many nephrite rings, knives, scrapers, and flint flakes for insertion in bone handles. The excavations during 1935-1936 at Rodanov gorodishche nearby brought to light a small hoard of coins which verified the dating of this site in the eleventh century. Remains of a dwelling including a fireplace and several stove emplace- ments were also investigated. Further, the expedition explored along the Chusovaia River, where a score of new gorodishches, settlements, and burial grounds were discovered. 5. The Kola Expedition45 of GAIMK (B. F. Zemliakov, leader) was organized in cooperation with the Soviet Section of the International Association for the Study of the Quaternary Period in Europe. The ex- pedition prospected for the sites of the so-called Arctic Paleolithic in the regions of the Rybachil Peninsula, especially in the neighborhood of Mo- tovskaia Guba (Bay) near the Finland frontier. Three of these sites were found on the eastern shore at heights of sixty, forty-two, and thirty-five meters above sea level respectively. The implements, buried in rough gravel twenty to twenty-five centimeters below the surface, are similar to those from Finland and Norway. These are the oldest sites found in this ter- ritory. Several Arctic Neolithic sites were also found at a height of from eleven to fifteen meters above sea level. Flint implements, occurring at only two stations, included crudely flaked points, scrapers, and flakes. At one site quartz and polished implements were present along with flint tools and some chalcedony points. 6. During 1935 and 1936 the Karelian Expedition"4 of IAE and the Ethnographic Museum in cooperation with GAIMK (V. I.

During 1935 the Bokhara Committee for the Preser- vation and Study of the Monuments of Material Culture excavated a wall surrounding Bokhara.51 This wall, attributed to the eighth century A.D., had the character of an earthen rampart with watchtowers of unbaked clay and was constructed after the fashion of similar walls of pre-Moslem origin which were once erected around large areas such as Samarkand. Samanid Ismail, who exerted his sway over Bokhara from A.D. 874 to 907, was the first ruler to abandon maintenance of the wall surrounding the oasis of Bokhara. This great wall, known as the Kampyr-duval ("Old Women's Wall") was two hundred and fifty kilometers in length. 2. The earliest mosque51 in Soviet Central Asia was discovered during an archaeological survey, conducted by the Committee, in Khozara vil- lage, forty kilometers from Bokhara. On the basis of architectural and stylistic form this mosque is attributed to the eighth century. According to Eric Schroeder, this mosque (if it was always a mosque or not is perhaps uncertain) is an invaluable piece of evidence as to the nature of pre-Samanid Islamic architecture in this region, formerly absolutely unknown.

The new discovery is an index of the persistence of little modified Sasanian forms: the lay of the pier bricks, similar to that of Tepe Hissar and the Tiri-Khana of Damghan, and the plan for its corridor of circumambulation.52 The outset string-courses barring the intrados of the arches appear to me an importation from India, through Buddhism.53 3. During 1936 another expedition (Sudakov, leader) began prelimi- nary excavations of the Romitan tumulus. This was one of the most ancient cities of Sogdiana, considerably older than Bokhara, and the official resi- dence of the pre-Moslem rulers."5 4.The Samarkand Expedition54 of the Uzbek State Historical Museum (I. A. Sukharev, leader) explored the region south of Samarkand between the suburbs and the Kry-tau and Agalyk ranges. This region includes the Dargomskaia steppe now uninhabited, but populated until the fifteenth century. Twenty-four monuments, registered during preparation of an archaeological map of the region, include sites of settlements, remains of irrigation, canals, etc. Two pre-Moslem clay seals, with human effigies en face, were brought to light. 5.(a) A fragment of a Greco-Buddhist sculptured cornice was found in October, 1932, by a Government cutter in the waters of the Amu on the Afghan boundary, near the border post of Airtam, thirteen kilometers west of Termez.55 This was forwarded to UZKOMSTARIS. The cornice is carved in high relief on a slab (100 by 38 by 47 centimeters) of marly lime- stone containing calcite, and weighing 320 kilograms. The technique is reminiscent of wood carving. The foreground of the design consists of acanthus palmettos; above these are figures of musicians, two female and one male, separated by three larger acanthus palmettos. According to S. F. Oldenburg, this is a portion of a group of five of the so-called Pafica Mah~iabda, "The Five Great Sounds," of the Buddhist art canon. The richly ornamented dress of the musicians is reminiscent of the Greco-Roman decadent period. The jewelry includes bracelets, earrings, pendants, and necklaces set with large stones. The tiaras resemble the re- cent headdress (bargak) of the noble ladies of the Khivan court in Tash- 52 Cf. E. Herzfeld, Archaeological History of Iran (London, 1935), p. 93. " Cf.

The faces of the effigies, two of which are damaged, are full, rounded, with bilateral chins and small cheek bones, straight Grecian noses, with large straight-set eyes and narrow, well-pronounced, sharply arched eyebrows, and moderately broad foreheads. The musical instru- ments include: a small, thirteen-stringed harp with a rectangular resonance chamber, widened at the top; a lute-like, four-stringed, waisted instru- ment with four lunate sound holes; and a small, barrel-shaped drum of the type used currently in India. These differ from other musical instruments of pre-Moslem times as recognized from the terra cottas of Afrasiab, etc. The remains of red ocher on the palmettos and the costumes suggest that the cornice may have been gilded, for ocher was frequently used as a ground. According to Chinese sources56 Termez was the capital of the Ta Mi kingdom, and the home of a thousand Buddhist monks, ten monasteries, and many stupas and statues of Buddha. Another Chinese source"5 men- tions that the numerous temples and obelisks (?) of the Ephthalite capital of Ba-Di-Yan (now Badakhshan), 300 kilometers east of Termez, were covered with gold. The heavy weight of the slab suggests its use in a large structure, probably a stupa. In 1926 a tower in Termez was identified as a stupa by an expedition from the Museum of Eastern Cultures, Moscow. According to Masson,55 the stylistic peculiarities of the cornice date it in the first centuries of the Christian era, and it belongs with the so-called Gandharan Greco-Buddhist art of western India and northwestern Af- ghanistan. Further study might well shed additional light on the early Buddhist antiquities of Hadda, discovered by the French expedition to Afghanistan, and now dated as between the third and ninth centuries.58 Other Buddhistic objects from this region and from Samarkand include bronze and stone effigies of Buddha, Bodhisattva, and Devata:59 a Gand- hara type of capital was discovered in 1932 near Vakhsh.

The escarpment of the second terrace of the Chirchik, west to the Dzhun irrigation canal was also explored. Nineteen gorodishches of "feudal" and "archaic" types were reported. (a) Feudal Sites. Five settlements were characterized by walls, bastions, towers, and by the presence of citadels. The finds are dated after the Arab Conquest. Excavation of garbage-pits of Iski-Kaunchi63 brought to light: Afrasiab types of glazed pottery, mainly white with black and red ornamentation, bearing Arabic inscriptions of the Samanid period (tenth century A.D.); bottles and thin glass vessels, some of them ornamented; a dark green glazed lamp; wheel-made pottery kettles of hard gray clay, painted black; spheroidal, yellow clay, wheel-made kettles, large (diameter 35 centimeters) and strong but with thin walls (2 millimeters) and pro- jecting hook-like handles; baked bricks (25 by 17 by 4 centimeters and 25 by 8 by 3.5 centimeters); and ornamented ceramic disks (diameter 70 centimeters), probably used as covers for vessels.

In the upper levels (20 to 30 centimeters deep) were white glazed sherds of V. L. Viatkin's "Sogdian type," while below was an ash pit (1.5 meters) containing bones of domesticated Bos, Ovis, and Sus. The pottery in- cluded: a fragmentary red bead; a red-wash cubical vessel (12 by 12 by 12 centimeters), a miniature pot (11 centimeters high); a vessel64 with a ram- shaped handle (12.7 centimeters high), one of the horns of the ram twisting forward; a crude kettle with rounded base and lid ornamented with finger impressions; pottery fragments showing cloth impressions; and frag- ments of pythoses. This pottery, with the exception of the Sogdian ware, was not wheel-made. Stone implements included a fragment of a hand- mill, two pestles, a stone hammer, several slingstones, and a rubbing stone (polissoir) with well-worn facets. A remnant of an unbaked brick wall, 10 centimeters thick, the intervals between the bricks filled with clay mixed with chopped straw, was found nearby. Beneath the wall and the pit lay a stratum of firm loess, 15 centimeters thick; below that, another ash layer, and at a depth of three meters the floor of the dugout. An. iron arrowhead, probably square in cross section, was found in the floor, together with a bead made from a boar's tusk. In the western wall of the dugout was dis- covered a small cave-like stove, while another was found in the cave below the dugout, which also contained many sherds of crude pottery, a scraper made from a Bos rib, a quartzite flake, and the bones of ram, bull, horse, and wild duck. As no floor level could be identified in the cave, it is as- sumed that the remains belong to the later dugout period. The finds from the gorodishche associated with the cave included many hand-mills, sherds, some with impressions of loom-made cloth, slingstones, and the bones of pig, camel, sheep, and bull. Most of the pottery was not wheel-made. Few glazed sherds were found, the greater number near the central tepe, currently occupied by a Moslem cemetery. Further cave settlements of the same type were found: five in the second site associated with the tepe; at three other tepes, Kugait Tepe (six kilo- meters from Tashkent), Shash Tepe (three kilometers southwest of Tersak village, between Tashkent and Chinaz), and Kafter Tepe (near Abjal-bob village). Each tepe occupied a promontory of the second terrace, with a watchtower, surrounded by a depression, a semi-circular gorodishche, the remains of walls terminating at the slopes of the terrace, and sometimes a second settlement beyond the moat. The contents of the cave gorodishches were, with small variations, similar to those of Kaunchi Tepe, red-wash " A similar vessel attributed to the third to second centuries B.C. was found in the Bronze Age tumulus near Khutor Veselyl, on the Kuban River, by the Manych Expedition of GAIMK in 1934.</page><page sequence="25">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SOVIET UNION 479 pottery, hand-mills, etc., the most characteristic feature being total ab- sence of bowl-shaped pottery. In Shash Tepe gorodishche were the remains of a large structure, consisting of parallel arched corridors, with walls 2.3 to 2.8 meters thick, built of clay faced by bricks (57 by 52 by 10 centi- meters). These may be the ruins of a stupa-like temple, a type common in Afghanistan, and also of some Mesopotamian tepes, whose unbaked bricks, by Borchard's measurements, would approximate in size those in Shash Tepe. According to Chinese and classical sources,"5 the territory around Tash- kent was occupied by a Scythian tribe known as the Sacae (Greek l'KaL), the earliest mention of whom is found in the writings of Ctesias (fifth century B.C.). The last reference to the Sacae occurs in Chinese reports of the first century B.C., which state that the Se (i.e. Sacae) were expelled by another people, the Yue-chih, who, in their turn, were replaced by the Huns. On the basis of this and other evidence, Grigor'ev tentatively dates the cultural layer of the gorodishches within the walls between the first ap- pearance of iron and the fourth century B.C. Ptolemy states that the no- madic inhabitants of the land of the Sacae lived in caves. Hence the cave settlements on the right bank may well be the remains of the Sacaean dwellings mentioned by Ptolemy. After the debacle in Central Asia, the Sacae migrated to the south of the Hindu Kush, where the dwellings described by the tenth century Arab traveler, Al-Istakhri, and in recent times by G. Markham, are com- parable to the dugout dwellings of the Samarkand tepes. Ten other tepes of the "archaic" type were recorded by Grigor'ev in the IAngiiul' region. 7. The Kazak A.S.S.R. Expedition of GAIMK (A. A. Jessen, leader) was organized in cooperation with the Nickel and Tin Prospecting Bureau to discover the sources of tin used in the metals of ancient Russia. Seven- teen deposits were explored in the region of the Kalba and Narym ranges, and in the valley of Irtysh above Ust'-Kamenogorsk. The only data bearing on the technique of mining in the first millennium B.C. were collected, and two new sites were found. The ancient gold mines of Kazanchukur were also investigated, as well as the Dzhungarian fortress of Ablankit, leading to the discovery of many tumuli and other monuments. SIBERIAM 1.

The "comb," "pit," and "carved" techniques of decoration are well represented. One important group of pottery is covered with a thin layer of bright crimson pigment, "polished in," and forming background for an impressed black ornament of curved ribbons. In its general character the decorations are zonal ("comb" impressions), spiral, double-spiral, and zigzag, with variations of the meander, and finally rhombic meshed net. The dwellings are sturdy structures, about two meters below the sur- face, still retaining traces of poles and storage pits. Grouped in villages, the dwellings each cover an area eight by ten meters or more. (b) This group differs from a in the less developed character of its pottery, the use of appliqu6 belts (rolls) superimposed over the slip, and in the presence of bomb-shaped vessels with straight, narrow necks. Mat- tenkeramik appears at these sites. The usual pigment is black applied in straight lines, occasionally on the inside of the vessels. Microliths are rarer and there are many slate knives, arrowheads, spearheads, and daggers copied from bronze originals. Cylindrical "paste" beads belong to this period. (c) Typical pottery included large Mattenkeramik vessels and vase- shaped jars with slender necks, having sculptured parallel belts, and ex- ceptionally wide, saucer-like lips, ornamented with indentations and knobs in pairs. Stone implements are rare, especially scrapers. Bone arrowheads and awls occur, while clay rings and bracelets, shell pendants, and per- forated boars' tusks comprise the ornaments. Fauna include dogs, Sus sp., etc. Many bones of fish and heaps of shells were unearthed. At Malmyzh traces of copper smelting were found. In the settlement near Khabarovsk burials contained bone arrowheads and pottery similar to that in the earth huts. A separate group of settlements near Sredne- Tambovsk yielded Iron Age pottery, stone implements, and iron slag not encountered higher up near Ussuri. Iron Age. (a) Near the Ussuri River were excavated remains of goro- dishches and earth hut settlements containing polished gray pottery simi- lar to that from the third Neolithic group. The inhabitants probably were agriculturists and practised animal husbandry. (b) Near Nikolaevsk, in the neighborhood of Lake Kizi and Lake Ntyr, the characteristic pottery, standing on round bases, was richly orna- mented with serpentiform designs or rosettes. Bone tools occurred in pro-</page><page sequence="28">482 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 39, 1937 fusion. There were remains of an iron industry and decadent stone imple- ments. Hunting and fishing were predominant. (c) Other monuments in both regions consist of remains of dwellings with stone flues (k'ang) and pottery of the Sung or, more probably, Ming period. On the basis of explorations at four sites, the petroglyphs may be di- vided into four groups, the latest associated with the Nanai (Samoyed) "horses" resembling birds. Other petroglyphs with incised effigies of horses are evidently more ancient. Those from Serachi-Al'iansk are probably re- lated to the Bokhai, since they suggest Chinese influence. At Kalinkova, where the most ancient petroglyphs have been found, occur "halters" crossing the anthropomorphic faces of the effigies, as they do in the Karasuk stelae. The relative Neolithic chronology can be established by: (a) the degree of stone technique development; (b) the evolution of pottery; and (c) stratigraphy of individual sites, as for example at Bol'shol-Dural, Zhele- khovo, and Bukola. Thus groups a, b, and c above are of concurrent periods, the latest of which belongs to the era before the "Yamato" culture in Japan and Korea. The data of Chinese chroniclers regarding the-I Lou and the Su-Shen ancestors of the Manchurians may be utilized to complete the history of the Neolithic period of the Amur Valley. The assignment of the Negidal division88 of the Amur Expedition in- cluded a study of the ethnography, physical anthropology, folklore, and archaeology of the peoples of the basin of the Amgun, the lower left con- fluent of the Amur, and of the area near Lakes Udyl' and Orel' and the Bichi River. The archaeological work in this region, inhabited by Negidals and a completely unexplored group known as Orel' Tungus, was to be coordinated with that under Okladnikov in the lower Amur Valley. 2. The Altai Expedition of GAIMK89 (S. V. Kiselev, leader) cooperated with TSUDOTRANS, the Central Bureau of Highway Transportation, to preserve monuments near the Chuisk Highway from Bilsk to Kosh Agach. Seven hundred monuments were examined along a stretch of 570 kilo- meters. An archaeological map was made of the Kural steppe, where small stone tumuli, containing stone graves with flexed burials, were found. There were also several ritualistic structures in the form of stone circles, 68 K. M.

Several tumuli of the Siberian-"Scythian" Pazyryk type, with collective burials of 283 indi- viduals, were excavated. A large tumulus, which unfortunately had been robbed, held three horses, one of them on the roof of the burial. The tumuli yielded considerable skeletal material. A wooden head of a griffin was also found. Another important group of interments in small stone tumuli near KuraI village belong to the era provisionally known as the T'ang epoch. These male and female burials, accompanied by horses, contained seventh to ninth century pottery and one well-preserved bast quiver of "whistling arrows." Earrings and other jewelry were present in some of the female burials, .in one case a necklace of Siberian stag (maral) teeth. Two mound burials held millstones forming hand-mills. This proved the contention of experts that the ancient irrigation system found in the steppe was used for agriculture, currently not practised in the region. Three tumuli, excavated in the settlement of Tadila, yielded the Pazy- ryk, T'ang, and stone mound types of burials. A hoard of objects, probably the remains of the last stage of the funeral ceremony, were found above the center of the grave, only forty centimeters below the surface. These in- cluded a knife, a silver vessel with an Orhkon inscription scratched on the base, and a bridle set with a silver buckle. Another burial, near Tuiakhta, contained two horses with harness sets; a human skeleton, resting in a hol- lowed log, was wrapped in a green silken robe, decorated with a belt held to- gether by buckles of stamped gold. A small bag carried magical objects and a bone whip or knife handle elaborately decorated. In addition there were golden earrings, bone inlay fragments of a Mongolian bow, and a bast quiver with "whistling arrows." An iron riveted kettle together with a sheep's bones lay near the feet of the skeleton. 3. The Siberian Expedition (B. E. Petri,70 leader) began excavations at Verkholenskaia Gora in 1923. During the removal of 156 cubic meters of loess-like silt loam deposit he found 4029 objects (figs. 1 and 2). Among the fauna identified by A. A. BelynitskiI-Birulia were: Rhinoceros antiqui- tatis, Cervus megaceros, Equus hemionus, Equus caballus, Bison priscus, Alces alces, Cervus elaphus, Ovis ammon, Canis lupus, and Cervus tarandus. Two new Paleolithic sites were found, one on the slopes of Kaisk Mountain on the outskirts of Irkutsk, the other in the Ushkanka depres- sion five kilometers below Irkutsk on the right bank of the Angara River. 70 B.

Gerasimov,71 yielded flint imple- ments associated with the mammoth, suggesting an earlier culture than that of Verkholenskaia Gora. It may, however, be more closely related to the Afontov Mountain culture of the Yeniseisk region brought to light by G. P. Sosnovskii and N. K. Auerbach. Fauna included Elephas primi- genius, Cervus tarandus, Alces alces, Equus caballus, and Bos sp. (? primi- genius). The Ushkanka site, found in 1926 by IA. N. Khodukin, shows cultural deposits similar to those of Verkholenskaia Gora, which Petri attributes to the late Magdalenian period. Petri reports72 the discovery of a new Paleolithic site which is as much older than the Verkholenskaia Gora [Moun- tain] as it is younger than Mal'ta. Preliminary excavations yielded fifteen excellent tools, not counting small items.... I shall proceed very shortly to the excavations on Lake Baikal, on the Angara River and the Kudu, where is my recently opened Paleolithic site.... M. M. Gerasimov, who opened the Neolithic graves on the Selenga River, has now left for a study of the Paleolithic sites on the Belaia River. A. P. Okladnikov leaves shortly for the excavation of the Neolithic cemeteries down the Angara River. From Leningrad has come Kazakevich, an Iron Age specialist, who is studying my excavations at Tunka [Tunke?], graves from the Genghis Khan epoch. 4. The Altai Expedition'7 of the State Ethnographical (formerly Rus- sian) Museum (L. P. Potapov, ethnographer, and G. P. Sosnovskil, A. T. Kuznetsova, archaeologists) worked in the Uspensk, Elikmonarsk, Ust'-Kansk, and Ongudal aimaks (territorial divisions) of the Oirat Auton- omous Area and in the Biisk region. An Upper Paleolithic station near Srostki on the right bank of the Katun' River, thirty kilometers from Bilsk, yielded twenty quartz implements, many flakes, nuclei, etc. This site, dis- covered in 1929 by S. M. Sergeev, was excavated in 1935 by G. P. Sos- novskil, who in addition to the artifacts unearthed remains of Equus caballus. The stratigraphy and the geological section of the deposit prove that this station is the earliest found up to the present time. In western Siberia, near Tomsk, N. F.

D. Kopytov in 1913. The first excavations, begun in 1935 by G. P. Sosnovskii, confirmed the earlier identification, and among animal remains were Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Equus caballus, etc. At Eniselskoe on the Biia River Upper Paleolithic implements were also found. These two collections were studied in the Bilsk Museum.75 A burial ground was investigated in the vicinity of Shibe, in the On- gudal afmak, Oirat Autonomous Area (Mountainous Altai), where a large stone tumulus with finds dating from the first century B.C. was previously excavated. A group of eight large stone tumuli of the "Scytho-Sarmatian" period was examined in the Talda Valley near Shibe and a chain of six large stone tumuli, one of them sixty meters in diameter and two meters high, larger than the famous Pazyryk tumulus, near Kurota. The large tumulus is to be excavated by the Oirat Museum. Burial mounds of Scythian and Turkish epochs were studied near Tuekta. 5. The Sale-Kharda76 (former Obdorsk) Expedition of IAE (V. S. Adrianov, leader) excavated a settlement of the fourth century of our era near the Polui River in the Yamal National Territory, where twelve thousand objects of an unknown culture were found: 1500 stone, bone, and bronze artifacts, testifying both to a higher culture than that of the modern inhabitants, the Nentsi (Samoyeds) and the Khanta, as well as to a different type of climate; spoons, figurines, and animal heads of worked bone; ornamented combs evidently intended for high headdresses; other artifacts of bone, iron, and bronze; a copper epaulette-like clasp of the type of the so-called Pianoborskaia culture; and agricultural implements suggesting that a warmer climate once prevailed in this frigid region. Ethnographical expeditions from IAE planned to continue work among the peoples of the Far North. In 1936 the staff concentrated on the Evenks (Tungus), Ulchis, Oroks, etc., in the basin of the Amur River and on Sak- halin and among the Voguls in the north. 6. In April, 1934, N. A. Gur'ev, the first mate of the fishing trawler "Krasnoarmeets," presented to IAE a collection of objects found in 1932 in the remains of a dugout on the shore of Tar'ia inlet of Avachinskaia Guba, three kilometers from Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka.77 75 N.

I. Panin, and a chalcedony arrowhead, a slate hatchet, and an effigy were presented to the third mate of a Japanese boat. In the remains of the dugout Gur'ev noticed many flint fragments, potsherds (?), and bones. There were no remains of wood or charcoal. He adds: Walking from the trawler base toward the fisheries, I found on the ground a stone resembling an arrowhead. I examined the surrounding territory and found a rec- tangular excavation made for the foundation of some structure. The hole, dug in the slope of a hill, was two meters deep on the mountainside. There was a worked stone imbedded in the wall, one and a half meters below the surface. Digging revealed the remains of bones, which crumbled at the least contact, and many fragments of stone of the same kind as that used in the implements. The bottom of the hole was clayey, with peat intermingled with sand at the surface. The Stone Age implements were imbedded in peat. The objects consisted of forty-three knives, scrapers, adzes, chisels, arrowheads, spearheads, and flakes of flint, slate, quartz, and obsidian, as well as two small dark obsidian, stylized human figurines.79 Another ob- sidian figurine made by pressure flaking, represents a stylized seal with well- modeled head and flippers. Similar human figurines have been found at the Neolithic station of Volosovo near Murom, at the Borki dune station near Riazan,so and at Kubenino on the Onega River, four kilometers from Kargopol. These together with a flint seal figurine acquired by Zenger at Zolotitsa on the White Sea are like those from the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys."8 A number of leaf-shaped obsidian knives with angular raised backs and slightly curved blades were also found. V. I. Jochelson82 recorded a similar asymmetric knife in Kamchatka during 1910-1911. In 1912 such a knife (No. 1942-16), found by A. A. Shchennikov in Old IUrtishche on Kamchatka, is now in IAE. Fur cutters in Leningrad today use this type of cutting tool. Stone implements were still in use in Kamchatka at the end of the seventeenth century: Karl Ditmar, who traveled there in 1851- 1855, saw a stone axe considered as a sacred object by its owner.

According to other travelers crude pottery, hand made and badly fired, was used up to the seventeenth century but was discontinued when the Cossacks introduced metal. The presence of pottery with the stone implements dates them as definitely prior to the arrival of Russians. The stone figurines are typical of the Upper Neolithic period in Volosovo. These remains may well belong to the end of the Neolithic period in Kam- chatka. SUMMARY This report summarizes some recent results obtained by archaeologists at several hundred sites by fifty-six Soviet expeditions. Grateful acknowl- edgment must be made to the Directors of IAE, GAIMK, MOGAIMK, UZKOMSTARIS, and VOKS, and particularly to S. N. Zamiatnin, R. F. Barton, Leo S. Berg, L. M. Slavin, and E. B. Reilly, who have contributed the information herein contained. At Field Museum we are also grateful for the assistance of Richard A. Martin, who edited the sections dealing with pottery, and also to Martin Wilbur, who checked the Chinese trans- literations. We wish to record our thanks to Hallam L. Movius, Jr., of Peabody Museum of Harvard University who called our attention to new discoveries in Siberia, which have been incorporated. Since this article went to press additional reports have been received from S. N. Zamiatnin, S. S. Magura, and B. E. Petri, and summaries of recent discoveries by ANU in the Ukraine and by UZKOMSTARIS in Turkestan are expected in the near future. The first issue of Sovetskaia Arkheologiia (Moscow and Leningrad, 1936), a periodical collection sponsored by IAE "to publish ... archaeolog- ical materials, historical researches on ancient monuments, critical articles, archaeological news, and bibliographical references," has been received too late to include extracts in the present article. The current issue contains three long articles: V. I. Raudonikas, on the Onega petroglyphs; M. V. Voevodskil, a study of the technique of primitive pottery from the forest belt of European Russia; and B. Rabinovich, on the dating of Scythian tumuli of the middle Dnieper. The "Materials" section contains the reports of 1935 excavations: in the Elizavetinskoe gorodishche (V. A. Gorodtsov); in Shan-Koba, Crimea (S. N. Bibikov); in the Gandzha-Chai Bronze Age tumuli, Azerbaidzhan (IA. I. Gummel'); and the Kama Expedition sites (N. A. Prokoshev). Among the important reports hitherto unpublished are those on the 1927 excavations at Pashkovskaia, Kuban region (M. V. Pokrovskii); the Bronze Age tumuli at Kuznetsovka, near Moscow (S. V. Kiselev); 1930 excavations, Medieval tumuli in the Novgorod region</page><page sequence="36">490 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 39, 1937 (A. V. Artsikhovskil); 1933-34 excavations in the Kalmyck region (P. S. Rykov); Neolithic stone fish from eastern Siberia, a study by A. P. Okladnikov. The news notes comprise accounts of the 1932 excavations in eastern Sakhalin by A. M. Zolotarev, as well as 1935 results from Sale- Kharda, Amur Valley, Novgorod, Saian Altai, and Koban culture sites in North Ossetia. An extensive summary of recent Central American ar- chaeology is given in the bibliographical section. The volume is exten- sively illustrated, and includes brief resumes in French. The authors hope that this method of presenting the recent archaeo- logical results according to geographical areas will inform the student of the work being done in the U.S.S.R.
