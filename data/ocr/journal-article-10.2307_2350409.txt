<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MORAL TO THE DIRECT-COSTING CONTROVERSY?* DAVID GREEN, JRJt "Tut, tut, child," said the Duchess. "Everything's got a moral if only you can find it."-LEWIS CARROLL T HE decade of the fifties may some day be known in accounting circles as the "Ten Years' War on Direct Costing." However, there is some reason to believe that the main battle is yet to be fought. Considered from one point of view, the controversy revolves around the central, basic question: What is an asset? To the extent that the continuing discussion as to which costs are inven- toriable sheds light on this central ac- counting issue, both accountants and users of accounting reports will benefit. There is more at stake than the choice of an inventory valuation method. In- deed, some of the related issues pose an opportunity for constructive change in both balance-sheet and income-state- ment reporting. Heading the list of re- lated issues are the problems involved in an intelligent accounting for (1) research and development expenditures and (2) the marketing and advertising costs of launching a new product. These are con- temporary problems for which no explicit provision has been made in accounting theory. The recent Senate hearings on profits in the drug industry, with their overemphasis on the gross profit calcula- tion, evidence the need for more precise accounting reports for those firms in which research and development and product promotion are of considerable importance. This paper will initially examine the asset question, first, in order to detail the changing meaning accorded the term "asset" and, second, in order to establish an operational meaning for the term so that certain expenditures now charged to expense will be included as assets. The balance of the paper is a careful look at a few of the related issues which probably are of greater significance for accounting reports than is generally thought. EVOLUTION OF THE DEFINITION OF "ASSET"1 What is an asset? Part of our diffi- culty of definition lies in the word itself -a word "foreign to accounting."' It is foreign, at least, in its derivation, from the French azsez, meaning "enough," which in turn comes from the Latin ad satis, "to satisfy." The early use of the term was in connection with the adequacy or sufficiency of an estate to bear the charges and legacies of a de- ceased person.2 Because of this early use, * The author acknowledges the help of his col- leagues, Yale Brozen, Sidney Davidson, Samuel Laimon, S.

Some insights can be gained by con- sidering the gradual change in definition for the term "asset." The quotations that follow do not constitute a complete canvass of the literature; rather, they represent a selection of remarks both from influential writers and from the ac- counting associations at chosen intervals spanning several decades. The first con- sidered, Esquerre's, published in 1914, is remarkably free from legal overtones, perhaps because he was so familiar with the term's origins: "The term 'assets' ... means, for a going concern, that which is owned and invested in the business; that which is earned, although not received, and constitutes a collectable claim; that which has been expended for the benefit of future periods."3 This last phrase, as will be noted later, is surprisingly "modern." After equating assets with "proper- ties," Paton wrote in 1922: "A property is any consideration, material or other- wise, owned by a specific business enter- prise and of value to that enterprise."4 In 1929 Canning queried, "What does the accountant mean by the term 'assets'?"5 Deciding that "the collecting of an extensive, not to say exhaustive, set of definitions does not repay the scissor- work,"6 he constructed his own: An asset is any future service in money or any future service convertible into money (except those services arising from contracts the two sides of which are proportionally unper- formed) the beneficial interest in which is legally or equitably secured to some person or set of persons. Such a service is an asset only to that person or set of persons to whom it runs.7 Some other definitions, in chrono- logical order, are: [1938] The assets of a business comprise all its properties or resources. In general, three conditions apply to the listing of items as assets, (1) that the business in question owns them, (2) that the business has acquired them at a cost, and (3) that they are of value to the business.8 [1941] The term asset, as used in baance sheets may be defined as follows: Something represented by a debit balance that is or would be properly carried forward upon a closing of books of account according to the rules or principles of accounting (provided such debit balance is not in effect a negative balance applicable to a liability), on the basis that it represents either a property right or value acquired, or an expenditure made which has created a property right or is properly applicable to the future.9 I Ibid., p. 136. Esquerre goes on to define assets for concerns about to liquidate. Although explicitly stated by Esquerre, the no- tion of "going concern" is paramount; it is always implicitly assumed, if not explicitly stated. "Going concern" posits the prospect that an enterprise will continue. This is in contrast with the estate (from which the idea of asset stems) which is subject to near-term realization and liquidation. 4W. A. Paton, Accounting Theory (New York: Ronald Press Co., 1922), p. 30. Subsequently, Paton wrote: "An asset may be broadly defined as any consideration, material or otherwise, which is owned by a specific business enterprise (or in which the enterprise has an equitable interest) and which has a value to that enterprise" (Essentials of Accounting [New York: Macmillan Co., 1938], p. 23). The re- vised edition of the Essentials appeared in 1949, and the definition was modified to the following: ". . . any factor, tangible or otherwise, owned by a specific business enterprise and having economic significance to that enterprise" (p. 15). The 1958 revision, with R. L. Dixon, stated: "The assets are all the physical things and rights (including intangibles) owned by the enterprise which have economic significance or value to the enterprise" (p. 16). 6 John B.

To what extent do the various defini- tions help settle the direct- (or better, the variable-) costing question? In brief, the question is: Which manufacturing costs should be included in manu- factured inventories? The "variable- costers" contend that the fixed factory costs belong to the time period and should not be prorated over production with resulting residuals remaining in in- ventory at the period's end. The "full- costers" argue that the variability (or fixity) of a cost has nothing to do with inventory valuation and that the cost of the ending inventory should include a pro rata share of all factory costs. Although . the last two definitions quoted seem superior to the others, each fails to settle this question. In Vatter's the use of the words "transform," "ex- change," and "store" and, in the Com- mittee's, the notion of aggregation, give credence to the axiom that costs attach. The costs-attach notion and its corollary, the matching convention, are examined next. THE COSTS-ATTACH HYPOTHESIS Full-costing has traditionally been de- fended by the notion that "costs at- tach." This is a basic concept of accounting that costs can be marshalled into new groups that possess real significance. It is as if costs had a power of cohesion when properly brought into con- tact.... The purpose of reassembling is to trace the efforts made to give materials and other com- ponents additional utility.... Therefore costs are assembled by products or time intervals as if they had a power of cohesion, not because as regrouped, they express value, but because they express parts of the total effort made to bring about a subsequent advantageous sale.... Some costs, like manufacturing overhead in which an affinity with a product can be de- tected, are allocated directly to a product; but other costs, like administrative overhead, in which it is difficult to detect an affinity with a product, are commonly allocated only to time periods, that is to say, against total revenue for the period.1 To speak of certain costs as having the powers of cohesion or affinity to product is poetic, perhaps anthropomorphic, and somewhat suggestive of molecular re- arrangement. It requires the accountant to establish which costs cohere (presum- ably, these are the costs related to fac- tory operations) when there are no ac- counting tests for stickiness. Thus, in practice, custom varies widely;13 this should not be surprising, since such measurements are necessarily intuitive for the accountant. These quotations indicate that costs can be related to product or to time period. Acceptance of the costs-attach hypothesis leads to the "matching con- vention." 10 William J. Vatter, The Fund Theory of Account- ing (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947), p. 17. Vatter's definition represented a complete de- parture from the legal overtones of its predecessors; his term, "service potential," used later by others, seems to stem from the "service-potentialities" of W. A. Paton and A. C. Littleton (An Introduction to Corporate Accounting Standards [Urbana, Ill.: American Accounting Association, 1940], p. 13, the source cited by Vatter). 11 Committee on Accounting Concepts and Standards, Accounting and Reporting Standards for Corporate Financial Statements (Columbus: Ameri- can Accounting Association, 1957), p. 3. 12 Paton and Littleton, op. cit., pp. 13, 14.

Inventories are '-'but cost accumulations in suspense, as it were, awaiting their destiny."''4 Costs technically associated with the product are matched against revenue from the sale of the product to compare "the ef- forts to produce results with the results produced": Ideally, all costs incurred should be viewed as ultimately clinging to definite items of goods sold or service rendered. If this conception could be effectively realized in practice, the net accomplishment of the enterprise could be measured in terms of units of output rather than of intervals of time.'5 Again there is a suggestion of choice of orientation-to the product or to time interval. Why choose the product? Is it because product costs are the predomi- nant ones-the largest of the functional groups? If so, is this still true in the "value-added" sense? Or is product orientation dictated by the tangibility of the product? Or is it because the cost aggregates of the product are useful to management in pricing decisions? Or is there something about the time period repugnant to accountants? Let us ex- amine this last question. THE TIME INTERVAL In large part, the work of the ac- countant is related to the time interval. Indeed, the income statement becomes meaningful only when the time period is known. This, of course, is fundamental even under the "attach" and "match" hypotheses. "By means of accounting we seek to provide these test readings by a periodic matching of the costs and revenues that have flowed past the 'meter' in an interval of time."'" No one has been as disaffectionate about the time interval as Hatfield, who said: But man is strangely agricultural in his traditions even though society has become in- dustrial. Time was when the recurring cycle of the year was of immense significance to him, for seed time and harvest each came in connection with the course of the earth around the sun. And man still thinks that he must reckon re- sults in terms of the accidental period involved in such a circuit.... And so accountants are asked to perform the hopeless task of taking this economic continuum, of chopping it up into arbitrary and meaningless lengths called a year.'7 But is it not this chopping operation that separates accountants from his- torians? If the reports are withheld until the demise of the enterprise, they are likely to be more "accurate" although not very useful. To establish opportuni- ties taken or lost, the time interval must be considered. Although the year is con- sidered the significant time interval, for many firms dealing with non-durable consumer goods-especially fashionable goods-the season of three or six months is more useful in assessing results. For others, "time periods are a con- venience, a substitute"' occasioned by the fact that all costs do not attach in a discernible manner. The position taken by the American Institute of Account- ants tends to reinforce the negative as- pects of the time interval: Attention is directed to certain facts which serve to emphasize that the word income is used 14 Paton and Littleton, op. cit., p. 14. 1" Both quotations from ibid., p. 15.

Profits are not funda- mentally the result of operations during any short period of time. Allocations to fiscal periods of both charges and credits affecting the determination of net income are, in part, esti- mated and conventional and based on assump- tions as to future events which may be invali- dated by experience.-9 Full-absorption costing contributes to this imprecision in two ways. First, there is an attempt to spread the fixed costs of the time period over the produc- tion of the time period; this results in the accumulation of costs "awaiting their destiny." The second step is concerned with "release" of these cost accumula- tions. The imprecision obtains when the accumulating and releasing are not in the same time interval. That is, if the unit level of inventory were always the same, the problem of "timing" would not arise (except in the LIFO-FIFO sense)- profits reported on a full-costing basis would be identical with profits reported on a variable-costing basis. When inven- tory levels change, profit calculations change with the choice of method. The fixed costs charged to the time period by means of the product will vary inversely with the change in inventory levels. Thus, even though the fixed costs are the same amount each year, expense for the year will exceed cost incurrence if the inventory is less at the period's end than it was at the beginning. Conversely, if the inventory at the end exceeds the beginning, the fixed costs charged to expense will be less than the fixed costs incurred for the period.20 The reports of the accountant would become more useful and better under- stood by managers and investors if his first frame of reference is the time period. This requires the operating state- ment to consist of (at least) two discrete measurements-revenue and cost expira- tions within a time interval. These meas- urements are made solely with reference to elapsed time, and reported assets at the end of the period are recognized only to the extent that they benefit the future. A first step toward revenue recogni- tion as it relates to the time period was taken with the use of the percentage- completion method on long-term con- tracts. Wartime exigencies may have occasioned recognition of this method by the Institute in 1942, but it was men- tioned by Kester in 1918.21 The per- centage-of-completion method of revenue recognition presupposes the existence of a tangible product. Thus, acceptance of this method could come under the frame- work of "attach" and "match." THE FUTURE-BENEFIT ATTRIBUTE: THE NOTION OF COST OBVIATION Most of the definitions of the term "asset" examined above, and others not cited here, contain the word "future" or words connoting future, such as "ex- pected," "storage of service to be re- ceived," "potential," etc. The unique requirement for an asset is its ability to benefit the future. Indeed, this is the heart of Canning's indirect valuation method: "The present worth of future outlays necessary to obtain like services in like amounts by the best available alternative means, less the present worth of future outlays necessary to obtain the agent's future service in the most eco- nomical manner . . . [is the series] that constitutes enterprise assets."22 19 Committee on Accounting Procedure, Restate- ment and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins ("Accounting Research Bull. 43 [New York: Ameri- can Institute of Accountants, 1953]), p. 59. 20 For a more detailed account, see George H. Sorter, "Reported Income and Inventory Change," Journal of Business, XXXII (January, 1959), 47-51. 21 Roy B.

Each "natu- ral" cost can be examined and a de- termination made of the extent to which each cost incurrence benefits the future. The "fixed" factory costs include real and personal-property taxes, supervisory salaries, fire insurance, building main- tenance, depreciation, and so forth. We must ask ourselves, "To what extent, if any, will next year's cost incurrences be reduced as a result of this year's cost in- currences for these items?" If we posit "going concern," it seems that we must conclude that cost incurrence this year does not obviate cost incurrence next year for these items or their possible sub- stitutes. This does not deny, in any way, the importance of these items. In terms of the creation of product they are as necessary as, say, the variable elements of power or raw material or machine operators. On the other hand, their necessity for product does not require that they be prorated over ending inven- tory. The asset should be recorded at a figure that represents the cost obviations it embodies. Thus, if our work force is employed under some form of guaranteed annual employment plan, labor services embodied in inventory cannot be re- ported as future benefits or cost obvia- tions. The notion of cost obviation is not pervasive enough to embrace all the things we now call "assets." That is, it is difficult to think of financial claims as cost obviations although they can bene- fit the future. However, the financial claims (cash, bank deposits, receivables, etc.) can be considered a special category of assets-"enabling" or "defensive" assets. The other assets can be thought of as "earning" or "offensive" assets.23 This last group consists, broadly, of the investments of the enterprise. For this purpose, investment can be defined as any "expenditure to acquire property- real or personal, tangible or intangible- yielding income or services."24 The notion of cost obviation is im- portant in two ways. First, it helps establish the existence of an asset-an expenditure with the future-benefit at- tribute. The existence of the asset is established from the answers to the ques- tion, "Will future periods cost incur- rences (expenditures) be reduced as a result of this particular 'investment' made for these designated services?" Second, and perhaps more important, cost obviation operates as a measure- ment or valuation device. The measure- ment of an asset may be the future cost obviations as reflected by past cost in- currences. This would set recorded cost as an upper limit; this is in keeping with present accounting custom. Alternative- ly, the measurement of cost obviation could be based on the expected level of future costs if, as, and when, accounting no longer looks to recorded cost for balance-sheet expressions. A WALK THROUGH WONDERLAND The purpose of this discussion is not really to advocate one inventory method or another. Rather, it is to set the bench mark for the recognition of assets. To argue about the inclusion or exclusion of certain costs in ending inventory at the same time that all expenditures for re- search and development and all ex- penditures for launching new products are expensed to the time period of incur- rence-this is akin to chasing gnats while on an elephant hunt. 23 See R. H. Robnet, T. M. Hill, and J. A. Beckett, Accounting: A Management Approach (Chicago: Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1951), p. 226. 24 Eric L. Kohler, A Dictionary for Accountants (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1957), p. 275.</page><page sequence="7">224 THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The growth-both past and expected in the future-in research and develop- ment expenditures makes mandatory an accounting method more sophisticated than "immediate charge-off as expense." The 1959-60 projected estimate for re- search and development expenditures is $12.4 billion; industry accounts for $9.4 billion of the total. This is almost double the total amount, and more than double the part spent by industry, of five years prior. For 1955-56 the total was $6.4 billion, of which industry's share was $4.6 billion.25 The Business Week estimate for 1969 is $28 billion, of which industry will account for $21.2 billion.26 Although much of industrial research and development has been financed by federal funds, the absolute amount of funds furnished by industry has been increasing. The 1969 estimate predicts the use of $16.4 billion of industrial money as against $11 billion of federal. If research 'and development expendi- tures continue to grow, the accounting argument of "offsetting error" is invalid. The accounting techniques necessary to deal effectively with research and development expenditures exist; "job- order" costing could easily be adapted for the accepted research and develop- ment proposal. Only those costs related to the project would be accumulated. At completion, for those projects which led to new products or processes, an esti- mate of useful life would be made, and the accumulated costs would be amor- tized over the estimated life. The costs accumulated on the projects which were abandoned or found useless would be charged off in the year of abandonment. The benefits from a change in account- ing procedure such as this are threefold. The research and development expendi- tures made to benefit future periods (as- sets) will be reflected on the balance sheet. This is desirable, since these are probably the outstanding examples of "offensive" assets. The income statement will show that portion of research and development which is the best measure of expense (cost amortization) of the period. There is also a good chance that the accounting that develops might help measure the success of the research and development program. As things now stand, it appears that part of the investing public is at- tempting to measure assets compared with expense for research and develop- ment, even though the data available to them are meager. At least, this is a possible explanation of the remarkable price-earnings ratios on traded stocks of companies with research and develop- ment expenditures that are large in rela- tion to sales, reported earnings, and re- ported stockholder equity. LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS: ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES The cost of launching a new product may easily equal or exceed the cost of developing it. One wonders how much of the estimated $11-billion advertising expenditure for 1959 was devoted to creating a market for new products. When the amount is known, should it be capitalized under the notion of cost obviation? Probably yes, since these out- lays usually are made in accordance with an over-all plan which differs little in substance and detail from the program to acquire the facilities for production. Costs of launching the product result 25 Data from National Science Foundation, Re- views on Data on Research and Development Decem- ber, 1959, p. 3. 26 "The Enormous Growth of Research," Busi- ness Week, December 26, 1959, pp. 50-51.</page><page sequence="8">A MORAL TO THE DIRECT-COSTING CONTROVERSY? 225 from the same kind of investment de- cision as the costs of acquiring machines, buildings, and so forth. The necessary accounting mechanics would be developed from the merchan- dising program. Suppose the facts are as follows: Costs of Con- Estimated templated Adver- New-Product Year tising Program Sales 1................. $4,000,000 $15,000,000 2 ................. 3,000,000 30,000,000 3 ................. 2,000,000 45,000,000 Total ........... $9,000,000 $90,000,000 These numbers suggest that advertising expenditures should be charged to an- nual expense at the rate of 10 per cent of estimated sales or 10 per cent of actual sales, whichever is higher. If expendi- tures exceed the plan in any one year, it may be desirable to consider the excess as additional expense in the year of in- currence. Whatever direction accounting technique takes, its goal should be to relate the expense to the period expected to be benefited. REDESIGNING THE INCOME STATEMENT The amortizations of expenditures for research and development and for product-launching would be "fixed costs" of the year in which they are expensed. These add to the importance of the time-interval concept examined earlier. As production processes and merchandising programs become more complex, the absolute amount of fixed cost increases. Frequently, the propor- tion of fixed cost to total cost will also increase. This means that the area in TABLE 1 HYPOTHETICAL COMPANY OPERATING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR 19X9 Annual charges not changed by intraperiod volume changes: Interest ....................................... $ 6,000,000 Real and personal property leases ................ 5,000,000 Supervisory and managerial salaries ..... ......... 20,000,000 Depreciation and amortization ................ . 25,000,000 Insurance and property taxes .................... 8,000,000 Research and development amortizations ...... . . 18,000,000 Distribution expenses and amortizations .......... 12,000,000 Total annual charges .$ 94,000,000 Sales revenue ...... .......... $250,000,000 Variable product costs ................. $100,000 Variable distribution costs ............. 20,000 120,000,000 Contribution to annual charges and profit ....... ............ $130,000,000 Contribution balance ................................... $ 36,000,000 Ancillary charges and credits: Charges: Loss on disposition of plant ....... ............ $ 1,000,000 Federal and local taxes on income .............. 16,000,000 $ 17,000,000 Credit: Gain on sale of investment .................... 2,000,000 15,000,000 Earnings for the Year...... $ 21, 000, 000</page><page sequence="9">226 THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS which short-run managerial prerogative can be exercised to influence profit is narrowed. Our reporting might be im- proved if we pointed up the annual chal- lenge (obstacle?) to profit posed by the fixed costs. This could be accomplished by a change in the format of the income statement (Table 1). The detail of those costs considered fixed would appear as the first section of the statement. The sec- ond section would contain the information on sales revenue and the variable costs administrative, product, and selling costs. Such ancillary items as exist would appear in the third section. For such things as the recent Senate hearings on prices and profits in the drug industry, a statement prepared in this fashion is infinitely more useful in ex- plaining the utilization of sales revenue. This format would be of greater use to the investor who is attempting to fore- cast the profit prospects of a particular firm. Within the limits of the necessary assumptions, the investor can calculate contribution percentages and the break- even point. Knowing these, he can more realistically weigh the consequences of expected change. CONCLUSION The accountant's preoccupation with product-costing during the explosive growth of scientific factory management is understandable. However, the problem of production is no longer the paramount one. New techniques are necessary if we are to account properly for marketing expenditures and for research and de- velopment costs. These new techniques might come as a natural outgrowth of the direct-costing controversy. From the arguments as to which costs should be included in inventory, we get a more solid understanding of what assets are. In addition, we perceive a more realistic measurement scheme than a "piling on' of layers or categories of cost. Each cate- gory of cost can be examined separately to determine the extent to which an in- vestment has been made to benefit a future period. Other benefits also accrue: the time period is given a renewed emphasis; attention is directed to the managerial problems involved in profit- able operations; and the accounting story moves closer to the business facts.</page></plain_text>
