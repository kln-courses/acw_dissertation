THIS is a second and revised edition of a book by a Norwegian scholar, written in German and originally published in I952. The subject with which it deals, the com- parison of Hebrew with Greek thought, is one of great contemporary interest and almost inexhaustible possibilities in its de- velopment. Dr. Boman's book is a short one for such a vast theme, and its survey of the questions is strictly limited. He is mainly interested in the psychological assumptions behind Hebrew grammar and idiom, and in the ways in which Hebrew and Greek minds thought of such fundamental things as out- ward appearance, time, space, and symbols. He devotes noticeably more space to Hebrew thought, ranging widely over the old Testa- ment, and including among other interesting things most useful studies of the Song of Songs (pp. 62-69), and the accounts of Creation in Genesis (pp. 91-95). In dealing with Greek thought, however, he limits him- self almost entirely to Plato and makes no reference to any writer later than Aristotle. Within these limits his work is of the great- est interest and value, and should certainly be translated into English for the benefit of English-speaking theologians and classi- cal scholars. Nothing would be more likely to encourage that interest in each other's fields which could be much more in evidence than it now is in this country. Small though the book is, it is one of great significance. It should give many readers some entirely 4598.vI.1 G</page><page sequence="2">82 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW new ideas about the importance of the Old Testament, and has even a contribution to make to such current topics as the limits of scientific thought and the possibility of 'demythologizing'. In short, it should prove stimulating to anyone who seeks to relate the thought of the ancient world to that of today. Two points in particular about Dr. Bo- man's conclusions are impressive. On several occasions he makes it plain that in his opin- ion Hebrew and Greek thought, though they start from entirely different assumptions, come to substantially the same results, for in- stance in the implications of the meanings of logos and dabhar (pp. 53-55), in the concep- tions in the two types of thought of the abstract and the concrete (pp. 56-59), and in their conceptions of the relation of appear- ance to reality (pp. 96-103). Instead of em- phasizing (as we have been accustomed to do ever since the appearance of Nygren's Agape and Eros) the fundamental incompatibility of Hebrew with Greek thought, Boman believes that they are reconcilable, and even comple- mentary for our understanding of the nature of reality. Secondly, he consistently repudi- ates the suggestion that the characteristics of Hebrew thought which strike us twentieth- century Europeans as grotesque or un- congenial, such as its anthropomorphism in conceiving of God,its intense subjectivity, and its dynamic, personal interpretation of pheno- mena, are necessarily 'primitive'. On the contrary, he maintains that in many ways these characteristics are truer to reality and more satisfactory than 'die subtilen, blut- und bildlosen, fast versteinerten Abstraktionen unseres hochwissenschaftlichen Denken' (p. 158). Though Dr. Boman has read widely in relevant works written in English (as well as in German, Scandinavian, Dutch, and French works), it is regrettable that in this second edition he makes no reference, when dealing with the Hebrew and Greek con- ceptions of time, to Dr. John Marsh's The Fulness of Time, published in 1953.
