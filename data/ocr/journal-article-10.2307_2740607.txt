<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indentification Wanted In 1964, Mr. C. R. McLachlan sent me a crude boomerang and a bone dagger or scoop (Fig. 1) which he had dis- covered in his office at the Port Eliz- abeth Museum. Since that time, I have been attempting to identify the source and uses of the dagger. The association of the dagger with the boomerang suggested that their common origin might be Australia; however, the fact that it is fashioned from the distal or metatarsal end of the tarso-metarsus of some large bird such as an emu or cassowary would suggest Ceram, New Guinea, or Papua as more probable sources. Casts of two similar bone daggers from the Sepik region of Papua have been sent to me by Edmund D. Gill, Assistant Director of the National Museum of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia. Both of these, however, are decorated with abstract and stylistic engravings rather' than anatomical. Mr. D. R. Moore, Curator of Anthropology of the Australian Museum, Sydney, Australia, writes: "It sounds much more Melanesian than Australian Aboriginal ... Such daggers are common in New Guinea ... but I have never seen one with such nat- uralistic carving as you describe." Physically, the dagger is approx- imately 11.5 inches (288 mm). long; 2.25 inches (55 mm.) wide at the grip- ping end; and 1.12 inches (29 mm.) wide at the mid-point. It has a sharp but smoothly rounded end with a very highly polished surface indicating long use. The elaborate anthropomorphic car- ving on the convex external aspect of the bone suggests that the object was highly prized and may have served some ritual purpose. The carving ap- pears to emphasize the cranial, ocular, nasal, oral (especially labial and den- tal), appendicular and abdominal (or mammal and vulval) features of the mythological figure or divinity it re- presents. I have been unable to find a strictly comparable figure in any source of Oceanian mythology available to me, including the Larousse Encyclo- paedia of Mythology (1960). A local newspaper, however, in an article reviewing a popular book on Tahiti by G. Farwell (1960), depicted an image of Oro, a pagan god, in his Marae, or temple, set in a narrow valley at Arahuruhu (Fig. 2). Except that the Oro figure is carved in -the round, apparently in wood, has rounded narial openings rather than a linear nasal ridge, and has a child between its knees replacing the abdominal opening of the figure on the dagger, there is a degree of resemblance be- tween the two.

Tahitian image oftheg Oro Fig.e 2. tahita imrague of the goadOo,s from the bamboo slats in the walls of the Oro figure's temple upon its round- ed belly and buttocks. According to Luquot (1960), in Ta- hiti "Oro presided over both after- worlds" (i.e. the one for the Areoi and the other for the common people) along with Hiro. The head of the Areoi afterworld was Urutaetae, while that for the common people was sded over by "the divine bird, Lota." However, "the divinity usually considered throughout Polynesia as the head of the afterworld was Miru." In New Zealand it was the thundergod Ngahue or Tawhaki "or it was the Great Lady of Shadows, Hine-nui-te- po, who sometimes ruled all the after- worlds and sometimes only the four upper levels where the state of the souls was less agreeable, while the next three levels were ruled by Rohe, and the last three by the goddess Miru." The fabrication of the dagger from a bird's leg bone may link it with Lota, the divine bird of Tahiti; or with her surrogate If the object came from New Zealand. If the object is in fact, a Maori cultural creation, the carving might represent Miru or Hine-nui-te- Po. It would add greatly to the value of this object to learn, (1) if it is a ritual instrument, (2) if its function was that of a dagger or scoop, and (3) the identity of the figure represent- ed in the carving.
