<plain_text><page sequence="1">49 SYMPOSIUM-IS THERE EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN NA.TURE ? I.-By REv. WILLiAM L. GILDEA, D.D. I SHALL not say anything new. Dr. Johnson preferred the wrong side in a discussion, because it left more scope for ingenuity and novelty. I find myself on the right side in this discussion. But if there were anything new to be said, in any case, I am not the man to say it. I can do no more than use the arguments of well-known authors with whose writings you are familiar; with many apologies to those authors and to you for the unskilful way in which I shall handle their arguments. How is it that the argument from " dlesign " has lost its force with some ? Is it because of the purely mechanical view of physical science which now prevails? Certainly not this. The necessary laws established by this conception of nature have driven the chance theory from the field and thus have done good service to those who stand up for " design." In the next place, this mechanical view assumes " design." For since mere laws could afford us no security against a turbid anid disorderly chaos, prior to their working, there must have been definite conditions and circumstances, definite collo- cations of matter. John Stuart Mill admitted the truth of this; and Mr. Huxley says: " The more purely a mechanist a speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement, of which all the phenomena of the universe are the coinsequences, and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the teleologist, who can always defy him to prove that this primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomenaa of the universe." The existing collocations of matter, then, are the result of orig,inal collo- cations of matter, antecedent to the laws of motion; in other words, the order and harmony which we now fiicd are the resualt of ail order and harmony impressed upon the system by some agent anterior to it, and therefore external to it. Mr. Spencer is virtu1ally a witness to the truth oF this when he describes the so-called homogeneous, which is the starting point of his hypothesis of Evolution as diffused matter endowed with all its present properties and moving slowly through ani ethereal medium. And Lotze says that however far back the evolutionist may go, he has always to assume some definite arrant emnont of parts, some general laws of action of which he can give no account; that there must always be a certain ordler to be accounted for, ancd that science is wholly inadequate to effect this explaniation. Is it that the theory of " final causes " stanids in the way of the v)</page><page sequence="2">50 pursuit of "physical" causes? Not this, again. Leibnitz declared that the reverse must prove the case. And in point of fact, teleologi- cal principles are the working principles, even of those who deny design. Haeckel and Laplace posing as philosophers may deny design. But Laplace, the astronomer, takes into account the " intelli- gence supreme " which must have so disposed matter as to produce the solar and stellar systems, and employs the purely teleological law of "stability "; wbile Haeckel, the biologist, is compelled to assume an end, object, and design in organic nature. The triumphs of modern science from the revolution which Copernicus effected in astronomy by the application of the purely teleological law of " parsimonv," have been obtained by considering the universe as if it had been a work of human art and applying, to its stucdy the laws wbich govern the human intelligence. Is it that evolntion has given the death-blow to design? Nor this. Evolution, like the mechanical view, has done good service to design. As Bishop Temple pointed out in his " Bampton Lectures," the old arg,ument from design did not exclude a multitude of designers, but "evolution" necessarily points to a single intelligence. The'n, again, as Hartmann, Wundt, the Duke of Argyll and others have shown, Darwin's system is essentially teleological. " In Darwinism," writes the eminent American botanist, Dr. Asa Gray, " usefulness and purpose come to the front again as working principles of the first ortler; upon them, indeed, the whole system rests." The conversation which the Duke of Argyll held with Darwin in the last year of the latter's life, gives an insight into Darwin's personal attitude towards teleology. In the course of that conversation the Duke said to Mr. Darwin, in refer- ence to some of Darwin's remarkable works on the fertilization of orchids, upon earthworms, and various other observations he had made of the wonderful contrivances for certain purposes in nature, that " it was impossible to look at these without, seeing that they were the effect and the expression of mind." Mr. Darwin looked at bim very hard and said, "Well, it often comes over me with overp ,wering force, but at other times "-and he shook his head vaguely-" it seems to go." Is it that the working of mind has been eliminated from the concept of nature? Not this, For those who deny a guiding intel- ligence, external to nature, are constrained to introdace an intel- ligence into the constitution of nature: "immanent intelligence," "mind staff," what not else ? Is it because useless formations bave bee-n discovered? Who is to say that this or that is useless ? We do not know all the powers of Nature, and we do not know all the purposes thereof. Man's intelligence is not the measure of truth; but the truth which he</page><page sequence="3">51 knows is the measure of his intelligence. We must not confound logical truth with metaphysical. Mr. Haxley says: " It is almnost impossible to prove that any structure, however rudimentary, is nseless-that is to say, that it plays no par*. whatever in the economy, anrd if it is in the slightest degree useful, there is no reason why, on the hypothesis of direct creation, it should not have been created." And when Haeck-el appealed to the existence of rudimentary organ as an argument against teleology, Mfr. Huxley answered him, with a dilemma, " Either these rudiments are of no use to the animals, in which case . . . . they ought to have disappeared; or they are of some use to the animals, in which case they are no ase as argu- ments against teleology." Is it that science is content to register material phenomena ? Not this, again. Its province is to seek the unseen behind the seen, to infer the invisible from the phenomena. Is it because a designer external t.o the Universe woulld land us in the realms of mystery ? Nor yet this. If we accept the teaching of Mr. Herbert Spencer, he will not guarantee us freedom from mystery. Rather he will pledge his word for the existence of mysteries. He writes, " But amid the mysteries which become the more mysterious, the more they are thought aboat there will remain the one absolute certainty-that man is ever in the presence of an infinite eternal energy from which all things proceed." I am not quite sure that he is not here pledging his word for Theism. We know, it appears, with absolute certainty that there is an energy infinite and eternal, that all things proceed from it, that man is ever in the presence of it. Add the note of "4personality," and we shall not be far short of Theism. After all, is not the note of " personality " implicitly there ? Man is ever in the presence of this energy. Now we never stancd in the presence of it table or a door; we stand in the presence only of a person,. Agaii. That which is infinite is necessarily either " formaliter" or "eiminenter," every perfection. And who will deny that "per- sonality " is a perfection ? " Persona," says S. Thomas Aquinas, " signifies that which is most perfect in all nature-to wit, 'sub- sistens in rationali natura '-whence, since all that is of perfection is to be attributed to God, seeing that His essence contains all perfec- tion, it is fitting that this name ' persona' should l)e predicated of God, not, of course, in the way in which it is predicated of cieatuLres, but in a more excellent way, like all otlher names given to creatures and which we predicate to God." Mr. Spencer fears to give the name "person" to this "infinite and eternal energy," lest he should seem to restrict its infinity. But the " Infinite " does not mean that which is withont any perfection. It means that which not only has, but is every perfection. "The perfections which creatures D2</page><page sequence="4">52 possess, ' divise et multipliciter,' says S. Thoms, " pre-exist ia God ' anite et simpliciter."' If men who are not Theists would take the trouble to read the treatise, "De Deo Uno," of S. Thiomas Aquinas, we should hear no more of "Anthropomorphism," " Carpeater Gods," "Brocken Spe-tres," and the like. To repeat the question once more. How is it that the argument from " Design" has lost its force with some e I give it up. I have gone throug,h eveir reason I could conceive, and found no cause in them. Those who follow me, if they do not agree with me, will explain. I lhave shown that the present order and lharmony postulate an order and harmony antecedent to all the laws of motion, i.e., postulate design. I have shown that " design" is considered the best working lhypothesis even by those who deny it. I may now say that as the application of teleological principles extends the bounds of science, so also each growth of science makes more evident still the evidence of Design. The progress of plhysical science has made it increasingly nifaiiest that the plhenomena of non-living bodies must be traced to an inconceivable complexity, and yet stability, in the ultimate atoms of matter. Chlemistry demands that the atoms of each elemeiit sJould be enidowed with numerous properties, be all alike in these pt-operties, and unchangeable; that is, as 'Sir J. Herschel remarks, " bear the stamp of ' manufactured articles."' " Suppose," says WVurtz, "we take the 64 irreducible chemical elements anid examine closely the ratio of their combination; we discover that they always combine in definite proportions. The relative weight is fixed in every combination, and the number expressing this relation is always inter- proportional for all kinds of combination. The elemenits only combine according to a fixed numerical ratio, manifestly declaring in this way th,at they have been exactly proportioned and adapted for their work in nature throughout all time. Almost all the sciences now employ mathematical formulm, and by means of these figures and formulae ar-e discovered the secrets of nature. How could this be if number in science were not founded on number already existino in nature? The whole range of human science is nothing more than the ascer- tained amount of skilful arrangement existing in the Universe. If there be evidence of design in inorganic nature, much more is thi e e evidence of design in or ganic nature. An organism is a complex livillng whole, the various pT;rts of which are reciprocally means and ends, and all the parts are means to the conservation of the whole. A distinguished biologist says, " The whole organism is instinct with an inmmaiient finality and ttleology xiot its own, which penetrates and e e(ulates the inmost recesses of the parenchyma of its structure. Not only evury system of organs, and every organ, bat every cel 1</page><page sequence="5">53 andl the constituent parts of every cell, in ful.lling the evolution of its own being and perfection, contributes its quota to the predeter- mined perfection of the one organic whole'" Then, ag,ain, the structure of an animal is exactly adapted to the conditions in which the animal is to live. Whence comes this perfect adaptation ? It cannL t come from the conditions of life themselves. The medium cannot set up iiistruments of resistance to itself. The waters cannot supply the fish with its pectoral fin; nor can the air supply the bird with its wing. We must, then, seek the power which so fitly suits the organism to its medium in the organism itself. Now the organism has been carried to its perfection either by expansion of the embryo, or by accretion. In either case, what Claude Bernard catlls " a directing alid organising idea," or " vital design," must be admitted. The only difference is that in the former hypothesis the "'directino idea " exists in its entirety in the germ, which thus contains poten- tially the entire ulterior structure; and the process of growth is nothing more than the expansion of all the original relations; while in the latter hypotbesis the " organising idea " distributes itself into successive acts of construct-ion. We cannot affordl to give up this "directing and organising idea" for the inefficient and inconsistent theory of 'Natural Selection.." According to this theory, the existing species of organisms owe their suirvival, in the battle of life, to some chance advantage accrluing to them from natural selection. These organisms alone hit the conditions of equilibrium, and these ailone can hold their ground. Yes! these aloine can hold their ground by all mean3; but there is nothing in this to prevent less for- tu-nate types from making their abortive bi&amp;s for a place in the world; and where are such tentatives to be found ? Natural Selection saves permanent races for the world, not by preventing the orig,ia of otbei s, but by defeating their efforts to hold their grouand. We ought to see them on every side, unstable types fighting for longer or shorter periods their hopeless battle. We see no such instance. Natural Selection fails to explain for us the complete and persistent elimin- ation 'of unsuitable types. For this reason I call thle theorv inefficient. Without proof and without warrant it supposes the battle of life fought out beyond hope of renewal of the struggle. The theory of Natural Selection satisfies still less when it attempts to account for the persistence of the stable forms of life than when it assumes the total elimination of the unstable forms. Here it is not onlyinefficient, but inconsistent and self-contradictory. An advantage derived from accident has accrued to a certain organism. There is, it appears, nothina more to be said. As in the case of less fortunate types, the battle has been fought and lost for ever; so here the battle has been fouglht and is won for ever. The law of heredity guarantees per-</page><page sequence="6">54 sistence. The advantage thus casually acquired will be repeated again and again indefinitely in successive organisms, notwithstanding the inconsiderable fact that these organisms have no necessary relation to it, and are open on every side to change. Is not this playing fast and loose ? fleeing with the hare and coursing with the hounds'? The accidental advantages were, in the first instance, gained by a departure from heredity and from law. And yet they are at once established under the sanction of law! The law is broken to obtain the advantage, and then the law is enforced to maintain it. One momenit the law sternly warns off; the next moment it fosters and cherishes. That the animat constitution should thus yield when resistance would bar improvement and become in- flexible when yielding would be mischievous, is surely an arrangement beyond the resources of happy fortuity. But it is especially through the phenomena of instinct that nature bears testimony with clear and emphatic voice to a plan consciously designed for definite ends. We find in the phenomena of instinct abundant traces of a force acting for a purpose which is yet not the purpose of the immediate agents. We see creatures admittedly without intelligence perfoiming without hesitation, and with unfailing precision, actions which, if performed by ourselves, would indicate a very high degree of intelligence, or at least, an elaborate training. The force guiding unintellig,enlt creatures in these operations we term " instinct." Instinct may be defined as a "guiding light directed to a practical conclusion, but not by means of premisses; telling the what, but not the why; guiding correctly, but not supplyincg the knowledge on which a correct judgment could rationally be based." To give some remarkable instances of instinct: The female carpenter bee, to protect her eggs, excavates in a piece of wood a ser-ies of chambers one above the other, separated from each other by partitions; the lowest chamber communicating with the exterior. She lays an egg in each chailiber, beginning with the lowest. When the inhabitant of the lowest chamber is ready to leave his nest, there is the exit prepared for him. The inhabitant of the chamber next above, when his time for departure comes, gnaws through the floor of his apartment and makes his way out through the opening used by the first departure. So in turn the inhabitants of the superior chambers. Clearly this complex nest was prepared by the carpenter bee with a view to the future actions of her progeny. Yet as clearly she could have had no prevision of these future actions. TIhe female wasp of the genus Spbex acts as though she distinctly foresaw the needs of ther future offspring. She provides for these wants in a manner which would seem to suggest a considerable lknowledge of anatomy. When the eggs have been hatched, the young grubs will require animal food, and yet will be utterly power-</page><page sequence="7">55 less to acquire it for themselves. As though she foresaw this want and would provide against it, the sphex stings a grasshopper, spider, or caterpillar, in the spot or spots where a sting would induce paralysis without causing death. She stows away the helpless insect with her eggs. The insect, incapable of motion, must remain there, and when the grubs are hatched they find at hand living animal food. The species of sphex which feeds on grasshoppers, to paralyse without killing, has to sting three distinct nerve centres, to reach one of which the neck of the grasshopper has to be stretched back, whilst the others are minute spots in other parts of the body. A man could not effect this withouit a considerable knowledge of anatomy. Yet the sphex performs the operation with unhesitating accuracy. In the case of a youngo mother doing it for the first time it certainly cannot be the result of experience, and as certainly she has not received instruction from an old hand of the tribe. The grub of the male stag-beetle is as careful to provide for his own future require- ments as the sphex is to provide for the future wants of her progeny. Both the male and female grub dig holes for themselves in which to undergo their metamorphosis; but while the female grub digs a hole no larger than her own body-for that is sufficiently large for hel reqtuirements-tlhe male grub, on the other hand, who will have to grow an enormoas pair of jaws, as though he foresaw this, dios a Lole for himself twice as large as his own body. Most wonderful are the instincts found among social insects where there are not only males and females, but also a large population of neuters. These neuters do all the work of the commanity, and require for this the most complicated instincts. To fit them for their purpose, even their bodily form has to be entirely different from that of the males and females; and in some species the neuters destined for different branches of work differ entirely from one another. Thus, in one kind of ant there are working neuters and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different. Yet these neuters are the offspring of males and females, none of whom, and none of whose ancestors, ever did a stroke of work in their lives. Many more marvellous instances of what we call instinct might be adduced. But I will not weary you by going through them. They would be as well known to you as the instances which I have mentioned. Whence comes this marvellous ing,enaity shown by unintelligent creatures? We cannot call it instinct and leave it there. We want a satisfactory reason to account for it. Montaigne answers, "By calling these insects uniutelligent you are excluding the true answer." "The fact is," says Montaigne, "instinct is a species of intelligence." This won't do at all. In the first place, far from being intelligent, these insects are very stupid indeed when off their beat, as I might easily prove, but as my readers</page><page sequence="8">56 will readily grant. Ia the next place, mere intelligence would not sullice to account for some of the instances of instinct mentioned. Given that the male grub of the stag-beetle knows that he is going to develop an enormous pair of horns, if he have intelligence of course he can provide against the evil day. But how is he to know it? Is the male grub also among the prophets ? Lamarck says: " Instinct is a habit which has become hereditary." This answer is more sonorous than satisfactory. If a philosopher of this school asked me how the wealth of the Rothschilds was made, and I replied that the present representatives of the noble house received it from their respective fathers, be would probably reply, " Very goodc! but how did their respective fathers come by it ? Don't you see you are only putting the difficulty back a step? I want to know how the money was made." In similar sort I tell him now that he is only puttillog the question back a step. How did the ancestors of these insects acquire this habit wbich they transmit as an inheritance ? No answer from Lamarck. According to others, instinct is the result of past intelligence. This view assumes that the actions now performed instinctively by the lower animals were once performed intelligently by their ancestors. All the objections which were urged against the theory of Mlontaigne apply with equal force against this view. Furthermore, it is open to an objection from which the view of Montaigne is free. I can conceive an individual doing mechanically what he has done before consciously and with intelligence, but I want proof before I can accept the transmission of this mechanical habit to his descendant.s. 3Moreover, if the ancestor has transmitted his habit a fortiori he has transmitted his intelligence. And yet, in point of fact, the lower animals show absence of intelligence in all but the actions which they do instinctively. "Complete collapse of intelligence theory," we ought to call this view. I will mention one more view, which may be called, I think, " the multiplication of hypotheses " theory. This theory supposes (to make it concrete with an instance) that an ancestral wasp accidentally stung different insects-grassboppers, caterpillars, spiders-in the different spots where their nervous ganglia respectirely lie; that by some unaccountable but constant repetition of this fortuitous hut happy hit, a habit was formed by the individual ancestor; that she foresaw the wants of her grubs, and by exercise of this habit provided against them; that this individual peculiarity, whiclh did not, like a congenital organ, modify the struc- ture and constitution of the creature, bat was only an acquired andl superficial way of movement, was transmitted by the ancestral sphex to its posterity; that its line thus became immortalized, that the pos- terity of all other sphexes than the heroine jast mentioned have goiie</page><page sequence="9">57 away, like Hans Breitmann's party, to the "Ewigkeit"! I cannot help thinking that Alice was only half in Wonderland when this tbeory was not presented to her. And how Alice would stare if an attempt were made to account for the instincts of neuter insects consistently with this theory! And how I should stare, too! What shifts we are reduced to if we would account for intelligent action in unintelligent creatures without taking into account that all-contro'ling and direct.ing mind wbose existence is preached by the meanest atom! I must conclude abruptly, as my paper has, perhaps, already- gone beyond due limits. On all sides we see in nature, animate and inanimate, the operations of a reason and logic which are not inferior to man's reasonings and logic-superior, rather, and correcting them. If nature were intelligent, without hesitation we should ascribe these adsaptations to the intelligence of nature. But we are as certain that nature is not intelligent as we are certain that her wor.ks indicate intelligence. We must then seek this intelligence, not in nature,. but elsewhere. Alnd where shall we seek it but in Him of whom the Scriptare, anticipating the discoveries of science, says that He has "disposed all things in number, weight, and measure"? Not the work of a " lapsed intelligence "-these! bat of an Intelligence whicl is " yesterday, to-day, and for ever." II.-By S. ALEXANDER, Wice-President. WHEN Dr. Gildea humorously says that he finds himself on the right side in this matter he is, I suppose, representing in simpler words the fact that he is on the orthodox side. Orthodoxy means thinking rightly. But although he may have on his side the majority of persons, I do not think that he has with him the preponderance of evidence. The subject appeals to s9 many minds, and has produced so exten- sive a literature, that controversy npon it is almost interminable. T'o take up each point in Dr. Gildea's paper and controvert it by hostile criticism, besides being uncongenial to myself, would not be the most profitable way of condacting the discussion. I shall try therefore to state first the positive view wbich I take of the question, and when l have made clear the conclusions which the facts appear to me to warrant, to notice afterwards some of the arguments of the pre- ceding, paper. I will concede at once that the idea of design, of a designing intelligence, is at firnst sight the easiest solution of the problem and has a primd facie plausibilitv. But in decipheriug the manuscript of Nature it is likely that we shall have reason to recognise the truth of</page><page sequence="10">58 a canon laid down by the critcs of human mnnuscripts,-the rule of preferring the more difficult reading. What is it that is in question? and what is admitted? If we taike the whole of Nature as it is revealed to us, beyond doubt we can dis cover in it the existence of ends, and a principle can be traced in it which we may call by analogy design. The principle may be traced in two ways. Whatever exceptions may have to be made, the permanent forms of life taken separately are adapted, and exquisitely adapted, to certain ends. Even structures like the human eye, wbich taken by themselves seem to be the clamsy work of one of Nature's journey- men, are admitted to be admirable instruments in the conditions under which they are to work. I put aside also the presence of apparently useless structures. Whether they are really useless, or only appear so to our present limited knowledge is a question much debated amongst biologists. But to assume that they are all useful, as every advance in knowledge seems to indicate, is to strengthen the argument from design. And the principle of design may be traced in a second way. Not only are individual forms of life adapted to their ends, but there is a hierarchy amongst the different orders of exist- ence and the lower serve the purposes of the higher and all serve the purposes of the highest, man. And I fancy that it is this " hierarchy of ministrations " which impresses the minds of men far more than the perfect adaptation of individual forms. These facts are undoabted. What is in question is not these facts but the inference from them. The inference drawn by the so-called argnment from design is that they imply an intelligence which has designed these single adaptations and this ascending order of service. This inference I dispute, both as going further than the data warrant, and as conflicting with -. certain portion of the data. 1 shall try tto shew that the existence of an intelligent design is an unnecessary assumption. If a man wished to constract such a world of forms as we find in Nature he could, it is true, do so only in virtae of a pre- conceived plan or design. But we are dealing not with men but with Nature as a whole. The appearance of design in Nature is so far from being a proof of an original intelligent design that it is itself the result of a process which is not design. That process is the process we know as natural selection. If it be asserted that there is still something hypothetical in this process (a point to which I shall refer later), there is at least no larger element of hypothesis in it than is involved in the idea of an Intelligent Designer, for in that theory we have to suppose, and not in virtue of our reason but of our faith and our wishes, that the waste and destraction in which the world abounds serves some purpose, a purpose which we, at any rate, are unable to verify.</page><page sequence="11">59) 1. That the process of natural selection itself produces the exqui- site adaptations of life in its individual forms to the conditions of their existence, is plain enough. The very meaning of the process is tliat those structures which are not so adapted do not survive. Let it, however, always be understood that it is not the extinction of rivals which constitutes the inherent teleology of orgautic forms. A. structure is adapted not because it excludes its rivals, but because it is a structure of a certain kind, or has certain properties. Many varieties are produced (it is now asserted, in consequence of the pairing of different individuals and of that alone); one of these varieties has certain properties which give it the victory over its competitors. Only that variety is left in existence which can live under the condi- tions to which it is exposed; it therefore exhibits the wonderful adaptation which we find and admire. Its adaptation and its existence are but one and the same thing. The animal is adapted in so far as it is considered in itself; it exists, in so far as it is considered in relation to the animals which have been defeated in their attempt to exist. And that it is adapted to its end is not something-at least the facts do not teach us that this is something -which preceded the trial of its powers against those of other forms; but is something which is discovered in consequence of its success, and is read into the successful form by the contemplating mind. There is no a priori idea of what is adapted to the conditions; but by seeing what forms succeed under the conditions, we discern what atructure adaptation requires. The idea of an intelligence which designed these exquisite forms reverses, therefore, the order of the history, which first of all produced them and next teaches us to attribute to them the attainment of ends. 2. The other problem is a more difficult one. The whole order of nature (including inanimate uature) is an order of ministration and of use, cildminating in the service of man. Is not this a proof of a designing Intelligence and moreover of a design which intended the welfare of mankind and more especially the prevalence of gooduess ? The answer is again a negative, and again the natural order of facts is inverted by the interpretation of them. The ministration of forms exists, but it is not an evidence of design; on the contrary, it is the inievitable result of the process which produces the forms. The lower forms are not intended to serve the higher, but only those hig,her forms are able to exist which are able to make use of the lower, to use their service. Suppose a new higher species to come into exist- ence, with varieties Al, A4, A3, . . . and take for simplicity the single instance of tne higher consuming the lower for their food. The variety A1, which can catch and can enjoy the beeves or sheep, or say the insects, which it finds, lives and produces offspring, the varieties</page><page sequence="12">60 A?, A3, . . . which cannot catch or cannot enjoy or cannot compete with Al, in the effort to find all they need, perish for want of food. The result is that only Al exists, and the lower forms seem to have been created to supply its needs. Whereas it was only because A,, was able to make use of them that it was left in possession of the field-to suggest to the minds of men the idea that the lower existence was designed in order that itself might live. I may seem here to have brought myself within the scope of the censure of a great philosopher. In his Metaphy.sic Lotze writes as follows (Bk. If., ch. viii., ? 229, p. 3'99, Eng,. Trans. ed. i.): " I know full well that as a thesis it may be maiiltained that any result, which presupposes mechanical agency presupposes nothing more than this. Nor is this new. LonIg agYo Lucretius declared that animals were not pravided with knees in order to walk, but that it was becausc the blind course of things had formed knees that they were able to walk. It is easy to say this and it may be that it sounds particularly well when expressed in Latin velse; but it is impos.- sible to believe it; there is no more tedious product of narrow caprice than such philosophy of the schools." I should feel very nervous about a proposition, if it could fairly be held liable to so contemptuous a treatment from a thinker like Lotze. But the case is widely different. Even if Lueretius' question i.s not an idle one, I am inclinedi to think he took the wrong view, in subordinatino function to structure. But here at any rate there is no question, as there, of two things which are really one and the same, but of the actual order of genesis of separate individual forms. For simplicity's sake I have taken above those cases in which the lower ministers to the higher form and have shewn that the appearance of design is the result of a process which is not design. But exactly the same explanation applies to the other cases of appar- ently designed and intended service, where the higher may serve the purposes of the lower as in parasitism, or to those more interestino and complex cases of what is called symbiosis, where two orgauic forms appear each to-serve the other. This is found in some cases of parasitism, as where an anemone lives in each claw of a hermit-crab, which it helps hold its prey and protects against the octopus, while deriving nu-triment from it. But the most striking cases of proper symbiosis are the union of men and domestic animals at the top of the scale, and lower down several instances where one organism actually lives within another to the advantage of both. In certain "vegetating" animals there are vegetable organisms, algae, coloured with chlorophyll, which live within the blood, feeding on the carbonic acid and nitrogenous waste contained in the animal's blood, and themselves supplying</page><page sequence="13">61 the animal witlh oxygen and starch and providing it with food when they are dead.* In these cases there is a most striking appear- ance of desigtu, but it is explained in like manner by the action of selection through usefulness, only that the process is a double or reciprocal one which takes place on both sides. The alga which lives within the animal matter of the hydVa has an advantage over other algae; the hydra in its turn, which fiuds its air and food within its own house, is able to compete with advantage in the struggle with its congeners. Man selects his domestic animals, which therefole seem designed for him; the domnestic animals select man, and convert his habits from those of a hunter illto those of the settled pastoral community. The admirable arrangements of nature are thus the product of the process of selection itself. What inference can we draw from this result as to the value of the idea of a creative Design? The data warrant the following inference. The course of evolution results in the beings called men, who are conse.ious of their aims, who deliberately adopt means to ends, who lay plans and make designs. Looking back on what they find in nature they find no expression so natural as to say that th-ie organic forms (and perhaps the inoiganic) exhibit design, that the whole world is built upon a plaii or order, is a manifestation of design. Such expressions are natoisal and necessary so long as we use lainguage at all. I for one do not propose to bailish the expression that the sun moves round the earth from east to west. I only maintain that the expression taken literally does not corresponid to the truth. And I do not therefore quarrel with those who speak of natuare as forming what we men should call a plan or design, but only with the inference that there is an Intelligence wlhich desigus the whole. Design exists truly only in one part of nature, in the region of human action. The facts warrant this; they warrant no more. On the coutrary, they directly conflict with the notion of a designing intelligence. For they shew that the fair order of nature is only acquired by a whole- sale waste and sacrifice. It is not to the point to reply that this destruction may serve a purpose. 1 am not speaking of the lives that are consiumed by others, nor of the death that subserves the life of a speeies, but of the death that accompanies the struggle whuich determines the permanent order, of the mal-adjustments which perish in conflict with the adjustments. Now a man's designs do often turn out to be failures, but lhe does not intend them to be failures; or, if he does, it is always with a further design, to convince * Art. PzTrahsiisbm Enc. Brit.</page><page sequence="14">62 others of some error. But does God create large-winged insects on islands in order tbat, seeing them caught up by the winds and borne out to sea where they perish, the small-winged insects may profit by the lesson, when He has not given them intelligence to profit by it? And if we put aside this impossible evasion, what would be said of a workman who deliberately made useless designs ? Bat this is what we must assume of the designing Intelligence, that He created failures in order that they might fail. If there were nothing in the world but successful forms of life, this objection would vanish. And it is by shutting their eyes to the incidents of the struggle and regarding only its products that men conceal from themselves the difficulties contained in the idea of a designing Intelligence. If anyone is inclined, as Dr. Gildea seems to be, to doubt the existence of such failures, of organic forms which are extinguished by the victory of others, let him turn to the facts which are cited in works of biology-are they not written in the Origin of Species ?-- or let him look nearer home at what corresponds in human affairs to the aimless destruction of life in the lower world-at the bad actions, false thoughts, and ugly imaginations which perish in the couflict with goodness and truth and beauty. lt is necessary to say this in order to guard against the misapprehension that in regarding failures as antagonistic to the idea of design, I include those good and noble lives of men which are called and often seem really to be failures, because the power is less than the aspiration. Good service rendered by men is not identical with-it may exist without-the conspicuous success which brings place and power or admiration. Many drops of water are needed to fill the ocean, but only the few which lie upon the surface can sparkle and rejoice iu the light of the san. The existence of failures and their accompanying incidents of ruthless destruction and misery, has always opposed a difficulty to the idea of an Intelligent Design, and the difficulty is increased when this highest intelligence is coupled, as it must be, with the idea of beneficence. Men have rebelled against the notion that such an intelli- gence should have deliberately created suffering and cruelty, and set pitfalls in the way of the unwary. They have not been satisfied with the easy solution, that the havoc of the elements and the suffering that attends transgression have been designed as a punishment or beneficent institution, but have held God responsible for the evil as well as the good. What! Be this juice the growth of God, who dare Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a snare ? A. blessing, we should use it, should we not? And if a curse, why then who set it there ? And they have been justified in their rebellion both by sentiment</page><page sequence="15">63 and theory. For how is it possible to attribute to a beneficent Deity the taking of means, which, if usedl by one of ourselves, we should brand with the deepest stigma of inlfamy ? And in the next place, to regard the failures and the ruin as part of a scheme of beneficence is once more to invert the order of the facts. The earthquake and the destroying lightning can bear the aspect of beneficence only in so far as man obliterates the traces of their malignancy. The view which has been expounded here is not open to the objection, always a telling one, that eliminate design as much as we may, we succeed only apparently, and do but push it further back into the beginning of things. For the whole of the present, so such objectors argue, must be contained in the past. There must have been an original collocation of matter from which the process of natural selection itself resulted, and this matter and its collocations we must regard as manifesting an Intelli- gent Design. Now if this reasoning is intended to imply that the history of the world exists in its beginning, as the plant is containedl in its germ, this is a most misleading analogy. The oak is not con- tained in the acorn. The acorn grows into an oak ouly when it falls into the ground and can draw natriment thence. If, however, it only means that whatever the early world may have been, the disposi- tion of forces was sucb that the acorn must fall into the earth, and Socrates must marry a scolding wife, this is strictly true, but it does not imply design. It implies St most causation. What the early world was I do not know, or how it came into existence; I do not know even if it is legitimate to ask the question; but whatever view we may take of this subject, the Intelligence which designed this original collocation designed therefore not only the adaptation and successes which resulted from it, but also the failares and hideous ruin and wreck which accompanied the process. The wonderful adjust- ment of means to e.nds which seems to support the idea of Intelligence convicts this Intelligence at the same time of heartless incompetence. I have expressed so strongly my opposition to the idea, that it must be added that these considerations, fatal as they are to the idea of Design, do not imply the untruth of Theism, but only of one kind of Theism. I do not think I could give any clear view of this ulti- mate question. I could only say that iu accordance with the theory I have sketched I should think of God as growing along with the growth of the world, and only becoming intelligent and capable of design with the emergence of humanity. There is an old Greek idea of a power called Moira, or Fate, which rales over evervthing, to which the Gods themselves are subject. And I do not know but that we are taught by the facts to accept a view resembling this, and to regai d God as participating in the process in which all things are involved.</page><page sequence="16">64 But to pursue such spe3ulatiuns woulld be oat of place in this dis- cussion. I woald only add a protest against obscuring the issue by notions wvhich are unexplained. Tell me what yoa mean by God, a man might say, and I will then consider whether the world can be said to be his intelligent design. Now the idea of a God, a Carpen- ter-God, who fashions the world into the world we know, with the history we know, is an iutelligible idea. The objections Lo the idta of sach a God do not concern, I think, the question of his intelligence, but of his omnipotence. Being as he is in presence of material -which exists besides Himself, He is not self-contained. This idea is, liowevev, at least intelligible. But the same cannot be said for the idea of an immanent intelligence by which it is attempted to evade the difficulties of a personal creator distinct from the, world, and to reconcile Theism with evolution. Either the immanent intelligence is nothing but a comprehensive name representing the fact that all the forces of the world result in the production of the order we see and know out of the chaos in which order is mingled with disorder; and if so, what right have we to call it intelligence, or beneficence, or attribute to it a personality ? If the phrase means more than this, it is perilously near to a catchword used to darken knowledge. At any rate if this intelligence is immanent, it is immanent in the failares as well as in the successes, and the God who is identified with this immanent intelligence appears as the union of the most contradictory attributes-at once the most exquisite of craftsmen, and the most blundering of bunglers, at once the object of worship and the object of execration, at once a merciful and long-suffering ruler, and the most bloodthirsty and reckless of tyrants. I shonld be glad to stop here, having said everything of a positive and constructive character that I had to sav. The difficulties Iaised by Dr. Gildea's paper which I have not in(lirectly answered concern the doctrine of natural selection itself, and if I were sure that Mr. Romanes, who I believe will come after me, would naturally take up this part of the subject, I should be glad to leave it to him and not meddle with a subject on which I have no claim to speak. At most, I can be only very brief. I have all through assumed natural selec- tion to be a true account of the hiistorical piocess of the world. I have done so (to make a personal statement.) for two reasonis: first, because I believe it to be u.sed as a working hypothesis by all biolori- cal inquirers, and so far as I am acquaitited with it myself, the evi- (lence for it seems overwhelming?, and the theoretical objections against it seem to me to rest uipon misunderstandings; but, second ly, because in the subjects witli whichi I am myself acquainted, I hare</page><page sequence="17">(65 convinced myself that the law operates ander bhe different conditionis analogously to that mode of its operation which is described by biolo- gists. So far as the present disession is concerned, the burning question of to-day, whether natural selection is the ouly cause opera- tive, is indifferent; except so far as a divine intelligence is supposed also to be involved, and this is the subject in dispute and has been disc-ussed. With this preliminary I may shortly touch upon Dr. Gildea's objections. 1. The argument that the theory of natural selection breaks the law of heredit.y in order to get variation and breaks the law of varia- tion in order to get heredity.-This argument which Dr. Gildea uses after Dr. Martineau appears to me, if I may say so with politeness, too wonderful to be good. It is in reality quite witbout foundation. What the law of heredity does is to determine the direction of varia- tion or to determine the limits within which variation is possible. A man's brothers and sisters may all inherit the qualities of his parents and yet may all vary one from the other. If one of them has a very marked quality, his children will probably have this quality very marked in comparison with other families, but variations will be possible amongst themselves. The main lines obey the law of heredity, the choice of the main lines is made from the different variations. 2. If natural selection is true, everything is the resalt of chance.- On the contrary nothing is the result of chance, and has never beeti supposed to be. We call a particular variation accidental only because, for all we know, it might have been any one of a number of others. It is quite certain that the existence of that variation is due to definite causes. 3. The argument from instincts.-This is the most pictorial and effective of all the argaments for design. But as to the bulk of instincts, they are claimed as deriving their origin from the law of selection either with or without the accessory law of habit. I must refer again to Darwin himself. No doubt some cases are most perplex- ing, and in particular the Sphex which stings its caterpiliars in theil proper ganglia. I do not suppose that for a long time to come we shall have done with the Sphex. Now Dr. Gildea concludes to a divine intelligence, because the Sphex is so stupid, and he will not hear of its instinct being a case of lapsed intellig,ence. But if the Sphex is ouly stupid, like bees and ants, then if the instincts of bees and neater ants (see Darwin) can be explained by selection, there is good hope that the Sphex may be explained in due time. There would be a real difficulty if Dr. Gildea held Mr. Romanes' view of lapsed intelligence. For if this were true it would be one item added to those facta which in the opinion of some shew that all Y</page><page sequence="18">66 apparently meclaaical actions in animals are originally intelligent. And this theory of fallen angels would be much closer to the theory of divine intelligence.* I do not know what use Mr. Romanes intends to make of his belief in the lapsed intelligence of the Sphex, or the ants which he found undermining a railroad. I am very far from being convinced that he is right, but at any rate this is not the question before me. As I am about criticising Dr. Gildea, I will add a remark suggested by his paper: that he seemed to be willing to prove an intelligent design on any terms, and that he treated the evolutionists cruelly in using them as evidence for intelligence while he rejected their prin- ciples. And when he put forward his argument to prove that Mr. Spencer's Unknowable was really a personal God, because Mr. Spencer incautiously said that " man is ever in the presence of an infinite eternal energy," I suppose that Dr. Gildea felt so sure of his position that he thought he might by way of a joke send a man out in front of the lines without any fear. But I am bound to use my sharpshooters as well as my regular men, and I will not let him off. So I will ask Dr. Gildlea a question. I am sitting in presence of many bandreds of books; are they all persons.? And I venture to think that Dr. Gildea is at this moment in presence of a difficulty. Does he think, except for the fun of the thing, that that difficulty is a person ? III.-By PROF. G. J. ROMANES, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S. BEFORE proceeding to consider the main question, I should like to offer a few very brief remarks on two points which arise out of the foregoing papers, and which I do not think are logically connected with the main question. Mr. Gildea writes:-" When Haeckel appealed to the existence of rudimentary organs as an argument against teleology, Mr. Huxley answered him with a dilemma. 'Either these rudiments are of no * I leave this sentence as it was originally wrritten. But the meaning (as I admitted in the discussion) is far from clear. Plainly, if all instincts are unin- telligent there is more room left for a divine intelligence to account for their unerring accuracy. And in this sense the first view is closer to the theory of divine intelligence. But I meant that if we can succeed in proving apparently unintelligent or even meebanical actions to be originally intelligent, then the evidence of divine intelligence will be greatly altered in character, for then the universe will appear to be intelligent in all its parts.</page><page sequence="19">67 use to the animals, in which case .... they ought to have di.sap- peared; or they are of some ase to the animals, in which case they are no use as argaments against teleology.'" Now, although this dilemma has often been quoted on the authority of Mr. fluxley, it has always appeared to me as transparent a piece of sophisiry as could well be imagined. In order that there should be a dilemma, there must be two horns; but in the present case there is really only one horn-the first having no existence in relation to the Darwinian theory. The pro- position is that if rudimentary organs are of no use to their possessors "they ought to have disappeared." Bat it belongs to the very essence of the Darwinian theory to sappose that such organs are in process of digappearing. It would be impossible upon this theory that such organs shoulld suddenly vanish the moment that they cease to be of use. Exrhypothesi, their disappearance must be gradual, and therefore ought to present all the various stages of degradation whicb in point of fact theyc do present. The only difficulty in the matter is to understand bow Mr. Huxley can have committed himself to so absurd a statement of the case. Substitute for the equivocal term " rudimentary organs," the more precise and descriptive term obsolescent organs, and the futility of Mr. Huxley's " dilemma" becomes at once apparent. Clearly, the real answer to Haeckel's argument from " dysteleology " is, that obsoles- cent organs, not having been specially created, do not furnish evidence of any abortive design. On the contrary, they fall within the general scope of natural causation; and therefore present no other or more special relation to the question of design in Nature than is presented by any of the other facts in the universe. The other point to which I should like to allude occurs in Mr. Alexander's paper. Speaking of the theory of instinct as " lapsed intelligence " or "' hereditary habit," he says, " This tbeory of fallen angels would be mach closer to the theory of divine intelligence [than that which attributes the origin of all instincts to natural selection]. I do not know what use Mr. Romanes intends to make of his belief in the lapsed intclligence of the Sphex, and the ants which under- mine a railroad." Well, in the first place, the intelligence of the ants wbich ulndermine a railroad is not lapsed. In other words, as I have elsewhere sufficiently shewn, it cannot be regarded as instinctive, but due to a perceived and intended relation between the means employed and the ends attained. In the second place, as regards t)he theory that many (though by no means all) instincts are the psychological vestiges or obsolescent rudiments of what were once initelligent ad- justments-a theory which was held by Mr. Darwin and still appears to me the only theory that can explain the more complex phenomena of instinct-I fail to perceive that it lies any nearer to the theory of divine intelligence than does any other theory of instinct. I do not suppose</page><page sequence="20">68 that Mr. Alexander would hold that the phenomenia of mundane in- telligence do anywhere constitute evidence of a peculiar kind, or ex- ceptionally cogent quality, in favour of a supreme or divine intelli- gence. But, if niot, why should he object to t.he theory of instinct as lapsed or degraded intelligence on the score of its supposed teleology ? Is intelligent adjustment any more indicative of supernatural design when it ha3 become by frequent repetition automatic, than if it had throughout continued consciouslv intentional? Are we to suppose that the technical skill of a Paganini is due to a special inspiration as soon as laborious practice has rendered his neuro-muscular machinery self-acting? If not, I confess to not understanding Mr. Alexander's point of view, or of being able to surinise to what " use " in the present connection he can have expected me to put the theory of lapsed intelligence. But passing on now to the main question, I may best begin by " crying ditto " to Mr. Alexander's paper, in so far as this argues the fact that the theory of natural selection has reduced the phenomena of organic nature to the same category of strictly natural causation as that in which all the phenomena of inorganic nature are now by general consent regarded as comprised. Such, indeed, is no more than I have myself always maintained, and in many published essays insisted upon, as the greatest among the many great achievements of modern science. But while thus fully agreeing with Mr. Alexander that the Dar- winian revolution has subordinated the facts of organic nature to the same dominion of natural law as those of inorganic; while main- taining with him that the principle of natural selection is in the full and accurate sense of the term a natural cause; and, therefore, while clearly seeing with him that all objections which have been raised against this view ace due merely to misunderstandings of the Dar- winian theory; nevertheless, I cannot go with him to the full length of the conclusions which from these premises he proceeds to draw. And I am glad to have this opportunity of considering what appears to me the erroneous, because unwarranted, nature of these conclusions, inasmuch as I have rarely seen what I regard as their accurate, because fully warranted, premises so clearly and so forcibly pre- sented. The fallacy into which Mr. Alexander-in company with an innumerable host of contemporary writers-has fallen is, as I understand it, as follows. It is tacitly assumed that when any phenomenon has received a proximate explanation at the hands of natural science, it has thereby Eeen proved no longer susceptible of any more ultimate explanation at the hands of what may</page><page sequence="21">r be termed supernatural theory; it is taken for granted that proof of physical causation is necessarily exclusive of any hypothesis of hyper-physical design. Now, without at present considering the validity of this hypothesis in any case, I mnst first of all try to make it clear that whatever the validity of the hypothesis may be, at all events it is certain that it cannot be affected by the proof of physical causation. Nay more, I will undertake to show that in assuming it to be thus affected, upholders of the so-called mechanical theory of the universe are really begging the question as between Design and the absence of Design. The province of natural science is restricted, and necessarily re- stricted, to an investigation of phenomena under the category of physical causation. And so well has natural science accomplished her work, that with amazing rapidity during the last two centuries the uliraculous has been banisbed from stronghold after stronghold. Un- derstanding by the miraculous any supposed system of causation other than physical, we have only to remember how astrology has given place to astronomy, animism to physics, exorcism to medicine, and so on, in order to perceive that the supplanting of special crea- tion by a natural evolution is destined sooner or later to be followed by a similar supplanting of a mystical psychology by a purely scien- tific one. And, when this consummation shall have been reached, the mechanical theory of things will be in full and demoustrable posses- sion of the whole range of observable phenomena. Therefore, it is concluded, the theory of Design will have been demonstrably nega- tived. But here is just the fallacy. What will have been demonstrably negatived Ls not the theory of design, but only the theory as to the manner in which such design, if present, has operated. If the ques- tion in debate were as between the miraculous and the absence of the miraculous (in the seuse above defined), then, no doubt, the mechanical theory of the universe would be triumphanit all along the line. Bat we must be careful not to confuse this question with the totally separate question as between Design and the absence of Design. The fact of Design in Nature (if it be a fact) is obviously distinct from the mode in which the Design may have operated; and therefore the proved error of any theory touching the latter need have no bearing at all on any evidence that we may have as regards the former. I say " need have no bearing," because I doubt not thai if any proof could be given, say of special creation as distinguished from natural evolution, better evidence of Design would be furnished so far as the evidence were deducible from that particular class of pheno- meena-to wit, the special adaptations presented by the creatures thus suddenly introduced as ready-made mechanisms in complete harmony E2</page><page sequence="22">70 with their complex surroundings. But without at present waiting to ask whether the special evidence presented by any such particular exhibitions of the miraculous might not be incompatible with the general scheme of things elsewhere (supposing that there be a scheme), the point now is that the topic of this debate-" Is there evidence of Design in Nature ? "-is totally distinct from the issue with which it seems so habitually to be confounded, viz.-Does the proof of natural causation negative the evidence of Design in Nature ? Of course if the assumption were granted-as Mr. Alexander seems to suppose it must be-that when any phenomena have received a proximate or scientific explanation, they are thereby proved no longer susceptible of any ulterior or teleological explanation, we might all have saved ourselves the trouble of meeting here to-night. For in that case there would be no longer any issue to discuss: cadit quaestio. But, as just displayed, the real issue has reference to the validity of this assumption. Therefore let as see what it is worth. When natural science shall have reduced-as I believe it eventu- :lly will reduce-all the observable phenomena of nature to the lominion of physical causation, and so shall have explained all these phenomena in terms of matter, motion, space, time, and number, what, in relation to the great question now before us, will natural science then have accomplished ? She will but have finally posited t.he question whether it is incompatible with any theory of Design in Nature that the mode of operation on the part of such Design should be uniform. All the facts of adaptation and co-adaptation in Nature (to which Mr. Alexander alludes) stand just as they have always stood: therefore, any suggestiveness of Design which they may ever have presented, they must still continue to present, unless some reason can be shown for regarding the modus operandi of physical causation incompatible with any theory of Design. Now, can such reason be shown? This, I apprehend, is the central core of the question. Mr. Alexander, following all other writers who belong to the so-called mechanical school, thinks that at any rate in the particular instance of causality which has now been discovered in the selec- tion principle, such a reason is to be found in the consideration " that the fair order of nature is ouly acquired by a wholesale waste and sacrifice." This consideration he develops at some length, and in the course of his exposition alludes to " mal-adjustments which perish in conflict with the adjustments; " of the " aimless destruction of life in the lower world; " of "bad actions, false thoughts, and ugly imacrinations which perish in conflict with goodness and truth and beauty; " or, in short, of ubiqumitous " failures " of the less fit in</page><page sequence="23">71 their struggle for existence with the more fit. Now, all this we have heard many times before; and, so far as the proximate or strictly scientific point of view is concerned, I believe it is impossible to overrate the immeasurable importance of this selection principle inherent in the very constitution of Nature as a kind of self-com- pensating mechanism both of perpetual balance and of no less perpetual advance. But, although it is not possible to overrate the importance of this newly-discovered principle, it is abundantly possible to overreach it; and this, in my opinion, is done when its obvious implications within the sphere of observation are hastily projected beyond that sphere. For what is this selection principle ? It is nothing more than a particular case of the general law of causa- tion. Therefore it falls into its place as one among all the other exhibitions of the self-same method everywhere observable in Nature -whether or not this method be due to Design. Therefore, also, until it has been proved-or, at amy rate, argued-that there is something in the method of physical causation in general which is incompatible with the hypothesis of Design, we cannot fasten upou any instance of such causation in particular as furnishing any excep- tionally good evidence against the hypothesis of Design. For science at least has proved to us that the method is everywhere the eame, so that the question whether or not it is a method expressive of Design can only be debated on the broad ground of Nature as a whole; not upon any one department of Nature, or by having exclusive reference to any one class of physical causes. Thus, when Mr. Alexander seeks to raise a negative argument upon the particular class of highly complex causes which are summarized under the term natural selec- tion-to wit, the inconceivably numerous and intricate causes which must underlie the phenomena of heredity and individual variation, the scarcely less numerous and intricate causes which gave rise to the struggle for existence, and so on,-the negative argument thus raised on what is, relatively speaking, a particular instance of natural causation can only be valid on the supposition of its having been previously shown that the method of natural causation is everywhere else-or in its very constitution as such-inimical to the theory of Design. For, in the particular case chosen by Mr. Alexander for the basis of his negative argument, it is the failure of the less fit in the presence of the more fit that here constitutes the natural causation: and therefore the facts could not be other than they are without departing from the method of natural causation. That there should be innumerable-or even an immensely preponderat.inig proportion- of what are called "failures," is thus seen to be an obvious necessity of the case, unless we suppose, either that the method is not one of uatural causation, or else that, if due to Design, an exception ought</page><page sequence="24">72 here to have been made in favour of some miraculous intervention, whereby the elsewhere uniform sway of natural causation should have been suspended in the domain of organic life. The first supposition no one could maintain, and the second would be scarcely less fataous. For the suggestion that an otherwise uniform method of Divine government (supposing such to exist) should have been interrupted for the parpose of obviating what we call " failures "-this sugges- tion could only stand upon the supposition that what are here called failures really are failures, not only in a relative but in an absolute sense; or not only in relation to the beings which perish, but also to the final ends (whatever these may be) towards which the whole system of this causation is directed. Obviously no human being can be competent to criticise the method in any such absolute sense; and, therefore, a' fortio'ri, no argument against a possible design can be raised on the basis of such relative failures. But we are entitled to go further than this, and to affirm that even in a strictly relative, or proximate sense, no such argument can be raised. For it must be admitted t.hat the failures in question can only be designated failures at all, by expressly having regard to them per se. So soon as we extend the area of our vision, so as to take cognizance of their relations to the system of Nature as a whole, we see that even within the sphere of human observation they can no longer be designated failures. In other words, they are failures only if it be supposed that their telos is that of maintaining themselves: not that of ceasing to do so, if needs be, in order to secure the higher or more general telos of advancing their type. Yet this higher or more general telos it certainly is that all such failares conspire to attain-and this as a matter of observable fact, whether or not the telos has been con- sciously designed. " The fair order of nature is only acquired by a wholesale waste and sacrifice." Granted. But if the "wholesale waste and sacrifice," as antecedent, leads to a " fair order of nature " as its consequent, how can t be said that the wholesale waste and sacrifice has been a failure? Or how can it be said that, in point of fact, there has been a waste, or has been a sacrifice ? Clearly, such things can only be said when our point of view is restricted to the means (i.e., the wholesale destruction of the less fit): not when we extend our view to what, even within the limits of human observa- tion, is unquestionably the end (i.e., the causal result in an ever improving world of types). A candidate who is plucked in a Civil Service examination because he happens to be one of the less fitted to pass, is no doubt an instance of failure so far as his own career is concerned; but it does not therefore follow that the system of examination is a failare in its final end of securing the best men for the Civil Service. And the fact that the general outcome of all the</page><page sequence="25">73 individual failures in Nature is that of securing what Mr. Alexander calls " the fair order of Nature," is assuredly evidence that the mrodus u'erandi has not been a failure in relation to what, if there be any Design in Nature at all, mast be regarded as the higher purpose of such Design. Therefore, cases of individual or otherwise relative failare cannot be quoted as evidence against the hypothesis of their being such Design. The fact that the general system of natural causation has for its eventual result " a fair order of Nature," cannot of itself be a fact inimical to the hypothesis of Design in Nature, even though it be true that such causation entails the continual elimination of the less efficient types. To the best of my judgment, then, this argument from failure, random trial, blind bluindering, or in whatever other terminology the argument may be presented, is only valid as against the theory of what Mr. Alexander alludes to as a " Carpenter-God "-i.e., that if there be Design in Nature at all, it must everywhere be special Design; so that the evidence of it may as well be tested by any given minute fragmetit of nature such as one individual organism or clas3 of oxganisms-as by having regard to the whole Cosmos. The evidence of Design in this sense I fully allow has been totally destroyedi by the proof of naturi.l selection. But such destruction has only brought into clearer relief the much larger question that rises behind-viz., as before phrased, Is there anything about the method of natural causation, considered as a whole, that is inimical to the theory of Design in Nature, considered as a whole ? This is too large a questioxn for me to deal with on the present occasion. On the one hand it may be aTrgu:ed, as Badei-Powell has argued, that the more extensive and the more uniform the method of causa- tion can be proved to be, the better is the evidence of Design that it farnishes. On the other hand it may be argued, as Herbert Spencer has axgued, that the method of natural causation is itself the neces- sary or mechanical result of what he calls the persistence of force- that is, in other words, of Being as Being, whether or not this self- existent or eternal Being is intelligent. Oa the one hand it may be argued, that it is the very consistency-or this very persistency-of the Divine method which blinds our eyes to the fact of its Divinity. On the other hand it may be argued that, even if it be the Divine method to govern by a system of general laws, instead of by a system of special interventions, seeing that the outcome must pr-esent to us the appearance of mechanical necessitv, we cannot be blamed, either morally or intellectually, if we conclude in favour of this view. Yet once more, it may be argaed, as it has been argued by a member of this Society in a recently-published essay-and this an essay of such high ability that in my opinion it must be ranked among</page><page sequence="26">74 the very few of the very greatest achievements in the department of literature to which it belongs-it may, I say, be argued, as it recently has been argued by the Rev. Canon Aubrey Moore,* that " the counterpart of the theological belief in the anity and omnipresence of God is the scientific belief in the unity of nature and the reign of law;" that "the evolution which was at first supposed to have destroyed teleology is found to be more saturated with teleology than the view which it superseded"; that "it is a great gain to have eliminated chance, to find science declaring that there must be a reason for everything, even when we cannot hazard a conjecture as to what the reason is"; that " it seems as if in the providence of God, the mission of modern science was to bring home to our unmeta- physical ways of thinkinag the great truth of the Div-ine immanence in creation, which is not less essential to the Christian idea of God than to the philosophical view of nature." But on the opposite side it may be represented-as indeed Mr. Aubrey Moore himself expressly allows-that all these deductions are valid only on the pre-formed supposition, or belief, "that God is, and that He is the rewarder of sach as diligently seek Him." Granting, as Mr. Aubrey MIoore insists, that a precisely analogous supposition, or belief, is required for the successful study of Nature-viz., " that it is, and that it is a rational (? orderly) whole which reason can interpret,"-still, where the question is as to the existence of God, or the fact of Design, it con- stitutes no final answer to show that all these deductions would logically follow if such an answer were yielded in the affirmative. All that these deductions amount to is an argument that there is nothing in the constitution of Nature inimical to the hypothesis of Design: beyond this they do not yield ainy independent verification of that hypothesis. Innumerable, indeed, are the evidences of Design in Nature if once a Designer be supposed; but, apart from any such antecedent supposition, we are witbout any mean3 of gauging the validity of such evidence as is presented. And the reason of this is, that we are without any means of ascertaining what it is that lies behind, and is itself the cause of, the uniformity of Nature. In other words, we no not know, and cannot discover, what is the nature of natural causation. Nevertheless, I think it is a distinct gain, both to the philosophy and the theology of our age, that science has reduced the great and old-standing question of Design in Nature to this comparatively narrow issue. Therefore, I have directed the puipose of this paper to showing that, in view of the isisue to which science has reduced this qumestion, it cannot be answered on the lower plaae of argument * In Lux Mundi.</page><page sequence="27">75 which Mr. Alexander has chosen. All that has been effected by oui recent discovery of a particular case of causality in the selection priuciple, is to throw back the question of Design, in all the still out- standing provinces of Nature, to the question-What is the nature of natural causation ? Or, again, to quote Mr. Aubrey Mloore, " Dar. winism has conferred upon philosophy and religion an inestimable benefit by showing us that we must choose between two alternatives: either God is everywhere present in nature, or He is nowhere." This, I apprehend, puts the issue into as small a number of words as it well can be put. And whether God is everywhere or nowhere depends on what is the nature of natural causation. Is this intelligent or un- intelligent ? Is it the mode in which a Divine Being is everywhere simultaneously and eternally operating; or is it but the practical expression of what we anderstand by a mechanical necessity? In short, is it original or derived-final, and therefore inexplicable because self-existing; or is it the effect of a higher cause in the exist- ence of a disposing MIind ? ALthough I cannot wait to argue this, the ultimate question which we have met to consider, I may briefly state my own view with regard to it. This is the same view that the originator of the doctrine of natural selection himself used habitually to express to me in con- versation-viz., to use his own words, " I have long ago come to the conclusiou that it is a question far beyond the reach of the human mind." Such, of course, is the position of pure agnosticism. And it is the position in which, so far as natural science can help us, we are logically bound to remain-seeing that natural science is only con- cerned with natural causation as its datum, and therefore cannot pronounce upon whatever may be beyond this datum. Hence, if we rest our opinions touching the question before us on the basis furnished by natural science alone, those opinions must necessarily be agnostic-and the only thing we have to see to is that our agnosticisn) is pure. It is no more open to Mr. Alexander, who fully understands the selection principle, to argue that it furnishes evidence against Design in Nature, than it is to Mr. Gildea, who clearly does not understand the selection principle, to argue from it in the contrary sense. As far as natural science can help us, we must all be equally agnostic. But if we seek to go beyond natural science in all its special departments of investigation, we everywhere encounter the question-What is the nature of that natural causation which it is the function of natural science, in all these its special departments, to investigate ? And, as already indicated, our answer to this question can ouly be determined, not by any knowledge of natural science, not by any study of abstract philosophy, not even by any enquiry touching the trath of a supposed revelation: it can only be deter-</page><page sequence="28">76 mined in those mysterious depths of human personality, which lie beyond the reach of human investigation, but where it is certain that throaugh processes as yet unknown to us, by causes-if they be causes- .as yet unrevealed to us, there resuilts for each individual mind either the presence or the absence of an indissoluble persuasion that " God is." I am not ashamed to confess that in my own indiv-idual case sucl an internal persuasion, or antecedent belief, is but extremely vague; and therefore I do not perceive any evidences of Design in Nature the valuA or cogency of which I am in any degree able to estimate. But this does not hinder me from perceiving that to anybody else in whom this antecedent belief is strong, there may be-and, indeed, niust be an immense body of such evidence, the cogency of wbich will vary with the strength of such belief. Moreover, not only will it thus vary in fact, but it ought so to vary in logic. In other words, the cogency of the evidence is properly or rationally influenced for each individual mind by the character and degree of the antecedent belief in question-just as the cogency of legal evidence is properly or rationally influenced by the strenigth of a prima fAcie case. Of course there must arise for each individual mind which holds suchi an antecedent belief, the question as to his grounds for holding it. But this is obviously a distinct question. And, supposing that he has satisfied himself with regard to it, he is forthwith in a position to view the evidences of Design in Nature from a stand- point totally different to that which is occupied by a mind not already or antecedently persuaded that " God is." Hence, the one man is as logically justified in seeing the evidence as the other man is logically justified in not seeing it. The point of view having been changed, the whole prospect is correspondingly modified. The question, " Is there evidence of Design in Nature ? " has been referred from the lower courts of objective fact to the supreme courts of subjective personality; and there it stands to be decided by each man for himself at the tribunal of his own judgment.</page></plain_text>
