Yet I did once see a ghost. Eleven years ago I was invited to present a lecture at Brown University. My hosts arranged lodging near campus in a proper Georgian house, converted into a charming bed and breakfast. The city of Providence was the nearly lifelong home of H. P. Lovecraft, and the address at which I stayed is mentioned in his story "The Shunned House."1 But I did not realize that fact until afterwards. I had come home late from the post-presentation festivities, tumbled into the antique bed, and fallen asleep. Around one in the morning an uncanny sensation penetrated my slumber, that disquiet that arises when you know an unseen person is staring at you. 1 opened my eyes and saw standing by the sink a woman in a flowing black dress. She glared, her anger palpable. Although she would not speak I knew the source of her wrath: she wanted me to tell her what she wanted. I blinked my eyes and the apparition faded. I fell back into sleep, wondering the inten sity of my dream, the kind of nocturnal visitation I had not experienced since childhood. An hour later and again the knowledge of a fixed gaze awakened me. She stood in fierce silence, her demand unrelenting. My eyes adjusted to the room's darkness and she once more vanished, but at this point I arose, turned on the lights, and decided to remain awake until dawn. I left the B&amp;B before the owner arose (you do not linger for muffins after seeing a ghost). The next day I emailed the manager to ask, in as offhand a way as possible, if anyone had ever reported spectral visitations in the room I had occupied. He responded that the cleaning crew sometimes spoken of a woman dressed in black glimpsed in the house, though she had never appeared in that chamber. Although the event unfolded over a decade ago, until recently I related the story to few, probably because the occasion did not haunt. Like the ghost herself, something seemed insubstantial about the incident. My reaction had Vol. 23, No. 3, Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts Copyright © 2012, International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts.</page><page sequence="2">398 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen been bodily, but the woman in black faded and so did the intensity of my response. I could never have told her what she wanted. Her query was either self-deconstructing or opaquely psychoanalytic. Either way the question was impossible to satisfy, and therefore did not trouble me for long. Yet over the past year the episode in Providence has haunted me anew. I have been on fel lowship leave from my academic duties as I write a book about stone, the least phantasmal of substances, a philosophical stand-in for the blunt solidity of all that is irrefutably real. I am writing about rock, though, because like medieval authors before me I discern in the lithic an uncannily living substance rather than an inert and passive materiality. To provoke and frame my thinking I have been researching ecological approaches to literature and the reconsid eration of the agency of the inhuman that has been called speculative realism (and more specifically, object oriented philosophy).2 While undertaking this research I have found myself drawn to the strange word undead, the negative of a noun that is already a kind of ultimate nega tive. Un-dead is not the same as alive, nor does it allow for the quiescence of mortality. Undead names the zone of restless and perplexing activity from which monsters arrive, a gap in the fabric of the known world that opens a space neither real nor chimerical, a breach in which everything familiar loses its certainty—including what constitutes life. In ruminating over undead as a kind of contact zone between the human and the nonhuman, as space in which the human becomes inhuman, I have been freshly haunted by that Providence ghost. A decade ago her demand confounded me. Now, though, in a culture that imagines itself as teetering on the edge of terminal catastrophe, I think I can answer her query. The lady in black faded so quickly because, like all ghosts, she lacked substance. What she wanted, perhaps, was to cease to be what Peter Dendle has so aptly described as a soul without a body.3 What she desired was materiality. The ghost in Providence was a harbinger of the zombie apocalypse. In one of our earliest accounts of folklore in Haiti, Zora Neale Hurston described the zombie as a body without soul.4 Hurston published her research in 1938, and although zombies enjoyed a brief vogue in contemporary film they did not so thoroughly saturate pop culture until fairly recently. When I glimpsed a ghost in Providence the zombie hordes that we now face with trepi dation and with strange joy had not yet invaded. Their Haitian origin already forgotten, these animated dead belonged, for the most part, to film—where they enjoyed a constant but not always conspicuous presence. Yet arrive these hordes have, banishing the modish ghosts and suave vampires of yesteryear. The future belongs to the rotting, groaning, lumbering, hungry, herdlike walk ing dead. This essay investigates the shift away from the specters which had been haunting our imaginations: frighteningly aesthetic creatures with cerebral JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="3">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 399 narratives and noble pedigrees, tracing their descent from Shakespeare, James, Marx, Lacan and Derrida. The specters haunting Europe have a deep history and a long colonial reach. Jeffrey Weinstock has demonstrated elo quently how from the time of the Salem witch trials ghosts have troubled the American national imaginary.5 Yet the disembodied enigma of The Turn of the Screw seems anemic compared to the harrowing eyewitness accounts of Max Brooks's World War Z (2006) and the comic gorefest of the film Zombieland (dir. Ruben Fleischer, 2009). Our undead are no longer ethereal and philo sophical specters, but have become shambling, putrefying, flesh hungry corpses whose urtext is not Hamlet, the Odyssey or "The Communist Manifesto" but a low budget film by George Romero {Night of the Living Dead, 1968). Specters and vampires sought to challenge our minds. Now the undead just want to eat our brains. What is at stake in this material turn, this movement from cogni tion to consumption, from subjectivity and personhood to mere corporeality, the human as yet another object in an object-filled world? Despite their haunting of high theory, ghosts have, admittedly, always resided at the intersection of pop and high culture. For every Hamlet's father with his "Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me," an army of chain-rattling basement dwellers materializes, waiting to be busted. We also continue to be fascinated by the vampire, an undead being who inhabits a middle space between specter and zombie: embodied, though somehow ghostly; blood loving and fatal, but an individual with personality, charisma, aesthetic sense, mystery. Yet it is easy to desire a ghost or a vampire. Not so a zombie. The various love poems in the recent collection Aim for the Head: An Anthology of Zombie Poetry offer lines like "gazing deep into your glazed eyes / you make me feel so vaguely alive" (O'Neil 46). Along with variations of "I love you for your brains" such tongue-in-cheek effusions are the best that zombie verses muster. Scott Woods considers our seeming absence of desire for the walking dead in his poem "I Hate Zombies Like You Hate Me": If we are honest, we do not love the zombie. We do not think the zombie is cool. We do not imagine the zombie for a lover or a count or a Tom Cruise/Brad Pitt sandwich. All zombie stories are about us, about the people who scream and run and die when something without the brain God gave a snow globe somehow manages to destroy us in a shopping mall. (57) We might not love zombies as we adore the urbane, homoerotic vampires envisioned by Anne Rice, or the sparkly spiritual versions of Stephenie Meyer. Yet to write poetry about zombies, to dress as them and imagine their depre JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="4">400 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen dations enacts a kind of desire, indicating their monstrous pull. Ugly, gauche, and anything but ethereal, zombies possess a negative aesthetic and they are everywhere. Like vampires they are embodied monsters; unlike their debonair cousins, zombies are nothing but their bodies. Whereas many familiar mon sters are singular and alluring characters, zombies are a collective, a swarm. They do not own individualizing stories. They do not have personalities. They eat. They kill. They shamble. They suffer and they cause suffering. They are dirty, stinking and poorly dressed. They are indifferent to their own decay. Although the walking dead possess a long history, the contemporary zom bie is a pop culture phenomenon, the gift of movies, video games, graphic nov els, and cable television. Literary versions like Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies are latecomers (though the beauty of Grahame-Smith's mash-up is its implication that Austen's characters always were zombies, until he revitalized them). The notion of an impending zombie apocalypse is so widespread that a bestselling handbook instructs you on how to survive the event. Over a million copies have been sold of Max Brooks's The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead. Inspired perhaps by its success, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta recently published the graphic novella Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic, self-described as "a fun new way of teaching about emergency preparedness." The CDC also offer a tongue-in-cheek webpage devoted to the management of virally induced zom bie plagues, where the following announcement appears: If zombies did start roaming the streets, CDC would conduct an investiga tion much like any other disease outbreak. CDC would provide technical assistance to cities, states, or international partners dealing with a zombie infestation . . . CDC and other federal agencies would send medical teams and first responders to help those in affected areas. ("Preparedness 101") Those of us who have watched the AMC series The Walking Dead or have read the graphic novels on which it is loosely based know that the CDC will not live up to any of these promises. In Season One, episode six of the televi sion series, the Atlanta headquarters of the CDC self-incinerates after its last remaining scientist fails to identify any means of combating the agent reani mating the brain stems of the dead. To the minds of the survivors seeking its refuge, the Centers for Disease Control promise knowledge and safe harbor. The institution delivers neither. Stealing a topos from Richard Matheson's vampiric zombie novel 1 Am Legend (1954), the lone scientist who mans the abandoned headquarters has been traumatized by the death and subsequent reanimation of his wife. He can see no way out from the future's bleakness, despite his frantic efforts to restore the past. Zombie films systematically rob family, neighborhood, city and nation of all protective power. JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="5">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 401 Peter Dendle's The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia (2001) lists over two hundred films. Jamie Russell's The Book of the Dead: The Complete History of Zombie Cinema (2005) adds many more to that list. Yet conventional media are not the zombie's only habitat. Those of us with an iPhone know that the undead takeover is in its last stages when it comes to the Mac iOS. Among the hundreds of zombie downloadables in the App Store are Zombie Crisis 3D, Zombie Drop, Zombie Assault, Burn Zombie Burn, Zombie Soccer, Zombie Biker, ZFL ("Zombie Football League"), Stupid Zombies (seems redundant), Zombie Pond, Zombie Heads, Zombiepox, Plants vs Zombies, Girl vs Zombies, Jason vs Zombies, Commando vs Zombies, Robots vs Zombies. Those with an X-Box know that zombie mode is a frequent option no matter the game. Any monster that captures the imagination long enough will inhabit three intimately related cultural registers simultaneously: horror, comedy, and chil dren's media. The zombie is no exception. Horror is our mode for mapping what we fear. As a perilous incarnation of collective anxieties, an ultimate terror, the zombie menaces the integrity of our systems of belonging, both metaphorical (the nation, the family) and literal (the body). The advent of the zombie announces the termination of human hegemony. Thus the sleep ers of The Walking Dead and 28 Days Later awaken to a reconfigured world, a history that is almost literally post-human. Comedy, on the other hand, offers a mode for at once expressing and containing monstrous anxiety. A prolifera tion of so-called zomedies have made the humorous potential of the undead evident. The discomfort that monsters elicit causes a bodily excitation that can be exorcised by a scream or a laugh; there is not in the end a vast differ ence between horror and comedy. Thus Zombieland is at once replete with cannibalism and gory deaths, and a witty meditation on zombie cinema, the kind of movie that announces a genre's meta-loving middle age. Even the most serious zombie narrative can elicit nervous laughter, the sound of anxious dis identification in action. Despite the propensity of its audience and even its authors to subvert its pedagogical impetus, children's media serve as form of diminishment and control. Because monsters make us uncomfortable we reduce their power by rendering them cute or otherwise abjecting them as infantile things, fears to be left behind as we assume our mature identities. Bram Stoker never imagined that Dracula would be transformed into Count Chocula, cartoon spokesmonster for sugary breakfast food, but such juvenilization is inevitable. The adorable little pixies now marketed so successfully to young girls under the Tinkerbell product line have as their grandparents medieval fairies whose crimes included rape, abduction, and murder. Is it cute or shocking that chil dren can place decapitated zombie head lollipops in their mouths?6 Horror, comedy, and children's culture reveal the same saturation. The zombie apoca lypse is not to come. In our collective fantasies it has already unfolded, and we JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="6">402 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen dwell in its aftermath. Just as the zombie swarm has captured various film, games, books and tele vision, so the critical explanations for the zombie's recent ubiquity are legion. Some excellent scholarship has been published on the embodied undead, from Jeffrey Weinstock's prescient essay "Zombie TV" to the recent and insightful collection Better off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human and Kyle William Bishop's American Zombie Gothic. Like the undead themselves zombie studies relentlessly continue to appear: no sooner is one essay or edited volume processed than another demands to be taken into account. Studying zombies is yet another mode of enjoying them, and this paradox inheres in their analysis: to understand the zombie's cultural significance it is necessary to transform a creature that is all body into a cerebral puzzle. Or maybe it is to admit that the division between corporeal and intellectual pleasures—and phenomena—is not sustainable. The zombie apocalypse—or what Kyle Bishop more positively labels the Zombie Renaissance—has dawned for numerous reasons, many of them con tradictory. The zombie is a monster polyvalent enough to incorporate a mul titude of fears, desires, traumas and hopes. Because the word zombie migrated from Africa to Haiti to the United States and thence to Europe, zombies might seem transnational and epochal, but that does not mean they are not historicizable. George Romero's ghouls in Night of the Living Dead, for example, offered "an allegorical condemnation of the atrocities of Vietnam, violent racism, and the opposition to the civil rights movement" (Bishop 14). Like all monsters, zombies are metaphors for that which disquiets their generative times. But while it is clear that images of the violence in Vietnam resonated with the early viewers of Romero's film, few who watch today will associate that war with the movie's profaned bodies. Yet Night of the Living Dead remains powerful forty-four years later. No single interpretation can capture a mon strous totality, no matter how persuasive that analysis might be. Monsters are more than the contexts that attended their births. Textual monsters are typically glimpsed partially. A sense of danger derives from a reader's never quite beholding a monstrous entirety, only the advancing claw, the resonating footstep, the jaws dripping blood: corporeal synecdoches that do not necessarily add up to a coherent whole. Frankenstein's Creature is an amalgam of corpses, outsized and ugly, and our imagination must fill in the inadequate narrative contours. Monsters gain power through their invita tion to participation. Film plays with this convention, especially early in the action, but not when it comes to zombies. These embodied undead require the full reveal, and they require it immediately. The zombie is pure visuality, and therefore a consummate cinematic body. Nothing is left to the mind's eye. Zombies are a special effects loving industry's dream come true. Zombies seem wholly natural (they are "just" dead human bodies) but their haunting is the JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="7">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 403 product of prosthetics, special effects, and digital enhancement. Multiple technologies have aided the exponential growth of the zombie population. Anyone with a smart phone, friends, and inexpensive make-up can create a zombie video for YouTube. Easy access to image-editing software combined with an undying love of unflattering pictures of celebrities have led to a proliferation of websites offering pictures of famous people altered to make them appear undead. Zombies are the perfect fodder for munitions-centric action films and video games (and sometimes, as with the Resident Evil series, it is impossible to tell the two apart). Zombies are human beings against whom the most horrendous violence may be ethically perpetrated. You have to shoot them through the head, and such execution is never a war crime. Offering the possibility of a murder that does not count, the zombie is the perfect monster for guilt-free slaughter. They are also relentless. Video games require enemies that turn us into zombies, pounding away at the FIRE button without cessa tion and without remorse. Maybe that is why games used to be marketed as enjoyable, but now they simply announce themselves as addictive.7 Zombies are proliferating at the same time as our reigning fad diet is the Paleolithic, extolling the consumption of raw foods.8 Meat-loving and con temptuous of grains, the Paleo Diet renounces agricultural humanity for a fantasy of primal hunter-gatherers who devoured what they killed or snatched with their own hands. Everyone was supposedly healthier when they resem bled Bear Grylls, despite the fact that most hunter-gatherers probably lived very short lives that terminated in the stomachs of predators. Like the "Born to Run" movement, this diet is propelled by a fantasy that the past was a bet ter space, and that the current imperfections of our bodies were in the distant past its flawless adaptations. The Paleo Diet, like the Zombie Diet, imagines that it is best to consume without adding culture to your food (do not process what you devour), and that what we eat should arrive through no intermediary (nature offers bounty enough). We might even be tempted to label both the Paleo and Zombie diets green: what could be more natural, more eco-friendly, than a culinary regime that leaves so small an environmental footprint? In the end, however, zombie diets are actually the more sustainable, since humans are in fact the most neglected meat in a flesh-loving culture. Zombies know that deer, horses, and humans all make good eating, and they were early prac titioners of snout-to-tail dining. Zombies are never individualized. They present the single human collec tive about whom we can without hesitation speak in terms of determinative mental traits, communal bodily designators, and stereotyped characteristics. Zombies offer a permissible groupthinking of the other. We feel no shame in declaring their bodies repulsive. They eat disgusting food. They possess no coherent language; it all sounds like grunts and moans. They desire everything we possess. They are a danger from without that is already within. We need JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="8">404 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen to erect walls, secure borders, build fortresses, and amass guns against their surging tide. Applied to any other group, such homogenizing reduction and obsession with physicality, communal menace, and fantastic consumption would constitute racism. But the zombie is a body from which the person has departed, so we can talk about them without worrying about nuance or big otry. The word zombie came into English by way of Haiti, where it arrived from Africa along with the island's population of enslaved peoples.9 The folkloric zombie is a reduction of person to body: an utterly dehumanized laborer, com pelled relentlessly to toil, brutally subjugated even in death. Old tropes gain new life in the contemporary zombie's body: regardless of its skin color, we speak of the undead in terms inherited from racialist discourse. This undeath of some fairly ugly rhetoric suggests that, despite the fervent assertions of some political commentators, the United States is nowhere near post-racial. As The Walking Dead TV series made clear in an episode entitled "Vatos" (1.4), fea turing a Latino "gang" whose bluster hides the fact that they are caring for the elderly in abandoned nursing home, life after the zombie apocalypse does not mark a radical break for everyone. Guillermo, the leader of the group and the nursing home's former custodian, declares that things did not really change all that much once the zombies appeared. Survival has always been difficult. Jacques Derrida obliquely predicted the zombie advent (where zombies convey human suffering) in 1993 when he published Specters of Marx, a book critiquing the triumphalism that attended the fall of the Berlin Wall. Before we start celebrating the end of history or ideology, Derrida wrote, we should recall that Never have violence, inequality, exclusion, famine, and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity . . . instead of celebrating the "end of ideologies" and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macro scopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth. (85) Our exultant self-satisfaction at communism's end—our very love of things coming to ends—blinds us to abiding, proliferating human suffering. From specter to zombie: is it any wonder that an ardor for the end of history has been swept away by an apocalypse that involves "violence, inequality, exclu sion, famine . . . innumerable singular sites of suffering"? The zombie figures the return of the injustices we quietly practice against people we prefer to keep invisible. JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="9">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 405 Zombies can be a dominating culture's figures for groups against whom violence and exclusion are systematically performed. They can figure the forgotten, exploited, and dehumanized who return. Zombies can also serve as an allegory for that culture in its entirety, or at least for its dominating ethos. Creatures of pure consumption and drive, zombies are the logical products of capitalism. Relentlessly driven to devour, grasp, extract and expend, the zom bie covers just about every signification of the word "consumer." Thus George Romero infamously set Dawn of the Dead (1978) in a shopping mall, where in a memorable scene the zombies are glimpsed riding the escalators to a cheerful Muzak soundtrack. Yet zombies may also embody corporate forces. In Night of the Living Dead, a film financed through borrowed money, Romero placed the zombies creditor-like around a house. Their violence is directed at both property and bodies. Their siege is a kind of foreclosure. In its limbo of body enduring beyond death, the zombie offers a vision of the afterlife that we have decided is otherwise impossible. Imagine there is no heaven, no hell below us, and we get the endless twilight of the zombie apocalypse, a place indifferent to good and evil, a hereafter without gods. Yet the walking dead are also very much of this world. We are haunted by zombies because we experience embodiment as a drag against the internet-induced fantasy of incorporeality. Perhaps we no longer dream of ghosts because we have become them. We dis-identify with zombies by slaughtering them en masse, allowing us to sustain our desire for an electronic realm where we are freed from fleshly restraint. Battling zombies is a wild liberation—or at least a powerful vehicle for our fantasy that we can escape our own embodiedness and become high-speed avatars, quick souls divorced from slow flesh.10 Para doxically, however, a bond of desire entwines us with the zombie we murder. During a television interview to promote Land of the Dead (2005), George Romero asserted that should zombies actually appear he would offer himself to be bitten so that he could live forever. As Sarah Juliet Lauro and Karen Embry observe in "A Zombie Manifesto": "The irony is that while the state ment prompts us to ask what kind of life that would be, it reveals that our fascination with the zombie is, in part, a celebration of its immortality and a recognition of ourselves as enslaved to our bodies" (88). Though they seem simple in their desires, zombies are irreducibly compli cated. To identify against and to identify with are both to identify: one move ment spirals into the other, abjection and incorporation. Despite films like Zombieland that give us advice on how to survive the apocalypse by distilling encounters with the monsters into a limited number of rules ("Double Tap," "Check the Back Seat," "Beware of Bathrooms," "Cardio"), everything we know about the zombie is untrue. For all their fabled stupidity, zombies reveal themselves as complex and contradictory creatures, at least when viewed as an aggregate of their many versions. Zombies seemingly function only within JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="10">406 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen a de-individualized and mindless mob . . . and yet zombies figure things out. They use tools. A leader sometimes emerges, or a zombie reveals himself as smarter than the rest, able to replicate an elaborate snare (I Am Legend), able to discern that the people smeared in horse guts are trying to pass as the undead (The Walking Dead). They possess the same reassuring meritocracies as we do. Zombies are supposedly driven only by the desire to feed; the person is gone from the body, and so no emotions or memories remain. Yet in Dawn of the Dead the zombies return to the mall because in life they were happy in that consumer paradise. In the The Walking Dead TV series the first zombie we behold is a little girl still clutching her beloved teddy bear. Later we witness a mother who, though now undead, every night returns to the porch of her home and tries the locked door. There is a tenderness to the scene that makes us forget for a while the danger zombies pose, the disaster that inevitably erupts when someone allows a loved one to die in their arms from the infection and for sentimental reasons cannot bring themselves to mutilate the corpse. Zombies must shamble . . . except for the swift and even agile zombies, from Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video to the 2007 version of I Am Legend (dir. Francis Lawrence, starring Will Smith). Zombies are a kind of ultimate enemy, because they are so utterly inhuman ... and yet we humans always turn out to be worse than the zombies we fight. We form our collectives in order to do battle with these monsters, and then we turn on each other and display a zombie-like aggression against what should be our community. In Night of the Living Dead, the "hero" Ben participates in but survives the violence practiced within the besieged farmhouse. Emerging from the place the next day he is shot by the police. J. J. Abrams's Super 8 (2011) is a zombie movie about the zero-state of emotionality to which trauma reduces masculine bodies; it takes a boy to demonstrate to a monstrous spider and to his own dad—both of whom have been psychologically scarred—how to escape zombiedom and finally love. The Walking Dead series seethes with brutality perpetrated by the living against each other, offering a sustained meditation on southern US racism and class enmity. Its cast of traumatized men also exposes as a lie the idea that zombies have no feelings. Men in the narrative have trouble articulating needs, desires, and emotions; when they do, disaster ensues. The zombies meanwhile are not emotionally dead; they are unremittingly expressive—of anger, of insatiable hunger, of trauma. They are raw. The zombies embody what the men feel. To return to the "Vatos" episode of The Walking Dead: though sometimes too saccharine, the narrative of the Latino "gang" brilliantly juxtaposes an industrial and fortress-like facility where the elderly had been placed to spend their last days with the transformed streets of Atlanta, an urban space made strange because traversed by dying, decaying, disabled bodies. The zombies crowding the city blocks offer the corporeal forms communities typically ren der invisible, now released from their warehousing in assisted living centers, JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="11">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 407 group homes, hospices and funeral parlors to fill spaces that normally purged of all signs of non-ablebodiedness. We live in a disability-fearing, youth-loving, death-phobic culture. When the elderly and disabled are institutionalized to live secluded from public view, when disability is conflated with the mori bund, when we associate the end of life with the smell of disinfectant and the scrubbed walls of a hospital, when bodies simply vanish after the person inside perishes, quietly carted away by people paid a trifling wage to ensure that we do not have to stand in the presence of a corpse, to stand in the presence of our own mortality, then the zombie offers a chance to behold our bodily future. What lays ahead for most of us is disability, and for all of us is death. The zombie is the perishable flesh that we hide from ourselves, the declaration of our own thingly existence. Through special effects, the zombie is our window to the visceral world to which we belong and into which we decompose. Surrounded by injunctions to conceal, costume and enjoy, we outsource the corpse to morticians, health care personnel, hospice workers and custodians. Yet the zombie's decay is not, in the end, an indication of its deadness. The zombie's body vividly exhibits the indifference of our materiality to the supposed superiority or control or beauty of the subjectivity that is supposed to reside within. Undead: the zom bie is life in death. Decomposition is the thriving of bacteria, the autonomy of the world, an unyielding demonstration of the inhuman agency that resides in the pieces and substances that we totalize for a while into a body we call ours. Decay is a process of transformation. It seems final, fatal, and terminal . . . but this activity is future directed, creative and uninterested in our mourning. The zombie's ongoing putrefaction makes evident an Object Oriented Ontology (OOO), which Graham Harman defines as a thing-centric mode of philo sophical analysis in which "individual entities of various different scales... are the ultimate stuff of the cosmos" and "these entities are never exhausted by any of their relations or even by their sum of all possible relations" ("Brief').11 OOO is a non-anthropocentric philosophy in which things possess agency, autonomy, and ultimate mystery. The walking dead offer what might be called a ZOO, a zombie oriented ontology, which makes evident the objectal status of the body as a heterogeneous concatenation of parts, working in harmoni ous relation, or exerting their own will, or entropically vanishing. The zombie becomes organs without a body, an assemblage of autonomous zones without a necessary totality. The zombie is the inhuman reality of the body, our com position by volitional objects that sometimes work together and sometimes do not. The zombie is therefore repugnant: we do not like to behold our own viscerality, our own material composition. But that does not mean zombies do not possess an aesthetic. They do, but it is a dark, worldly, challenging, and embodied one. In a strange way it can also be beautiful. Kyle Bishop argues that zombies are unique in that unlike vampires, JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="12">408 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen werewolves, or golems they enter film directly from folklore, without literary intermediaries. He describes the zombie as a distinctively American colonial monster (38). Bishop, to be clear, is speaking of the body without a soul descended from Haitian voodoo and films like White Zombie (dir. Victor Hal perin, 1932). These animated and enslaved corpses are human robots. They have lost their personality and will. To this creature George Romero will add cannibalism and subtract a controlling master to yield the zombie familiar today, a monster that no longer seems to have so direct a connection to Haiti or slavery, and yet (as we have seen) is thoroughly if ambivalently racialized. Yet the ancestry that Bishop traces collects traits and narratives from other monsters, many of them ancient and European. The zombie's literary heritage is obscured by the fact that its progenitors do not pass under the term "zombie" (and, it is worth noting, George Romero did not call the creatures in Night of the Living Dead zombies; that designation comes in Dawn of the Dead, exert ing a powerful retroactive effect). Like dragons and giants, the walking dead are transcultural monsters, haunting nearly every geography and history. Our hope and our fear that death is not the end of life amount to the same thing, yielding gods who rise from the dead to redeem us as well as humans who rise from the dead to feed upon us. A vigorous tradition of animated corpses unfolds in medieval Icelandic texts, where the sagas speak of a revenant called the draugr or aptrgangr who once interred will not remain still. In Grettir's saga, we learn of Glarn, a pagan from Sweden hired by a farmer to tend sheep on a haunted mountainside. Glam refuses to be part of the farmhouse community, and will not attend Christmas services or even fast before the holy day.12 Glam is murdered by some kind of monster during a Christmas Eve snowstorm, and his employer finds it impossible to bring the corpse to Christian burial. Once interred in a cairn Glam begins haunting the farm, riding atop its roof at night and descend ing to smash to pieces the bones of any animal or human foolish enough to spend the night nearby. The young warrior Grettir offers to rid the farm of this aptrgangr, this "again walker." Glam had always been strange looking: in life "extremely large ... a strange appearance, with wide-open blue eyes and wolf grey hair" (32), in death "large and horribly deformed, with strange oversized features" (35). Grettir wrestles with the monster furiously, destroying parts of the house and then tumbling through the door: Glam, now off balance, came crashing out of the house with Grettir on top of him. Outside it was bright in the moonlight, with gaps here and there in the cloud cover. On and off, the moon shone through. Just as Glam fell the clouds moved, revealing the moon. Glam stared up at the light, and Grettir later said that this sight was the only one that ever scared him. Exhaustion and the sight of Glam's threatening eyes now took their toll, and Grettir's JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="13">Undead (A Zombie Oriented Ontology) • 409 strength left him. Unable to draw his sax, he lay between life and death. (35) At this moment when Grettir himself seems undead, Glam curses his foe, declaring that he will never reach more than half his strength, that he will forever fear the dark. Grettir decapitates Glam and places the head against the buttocks, ensuring the monster will not return. Glam's prediction will, however, hold true, and Grettir forever fears darkness and isolation. His death will unfold as a result. Glam is clearly the walking dead, but not exactly a zombie in the contem porary sense. He murders, but not for food; after death his personhood endures within his body. The episode well illustrates something that lurks within but is often hidden by modern zombie narratives: the environmental aesthetic of the undead. Zombies are creatures who have no need of shelter. They do not build. They exist in an uncultured state. Perhaps they incarnate our fears of inimical nature. Yet they are in the end too separate from their worlds, too autonomous, too solitarily human. The zombies of the apocalypse never quite break from anthropomorphism. Humans living and undead both inhabit the same limited ambit. Even if they sometimes devour animals, zombies generally eat only live human beings, not each other, and never plants: their diet is evi dence enough of how circumscribed their monstrosity remains. Zombies might be literally post-human but they remain disappointingly anthropocentric. Frankenstein's Creature, who learns the ways of the world through the groaning of glaciers in the Alps, who is spotted most often in resplendent, icy spaces, knows as undead Glam does that a continuity binds body and world. Their mutual love of icescapes, where the movement of the earth is constant, suggests that their undeath is perhaps the same as the animation of that which was never supposed to have held life. They are undead as the world is undead. Glam's power is not fully exerted until he is outdoors, in those wild spaces that during his life as a shepherd he dwelled. His curse is delivered only when clouds cease to obscure the moon, when the cold night is bathed in a radiance that makes Glam's eyes glisten. A being of lunar luminescence, broken stones, and blizzards, Glam in his undeath is that against which we build our houses, the excluded as well as the inhuman. The aptrgangr, the again-walker is a mon ster whose life in death makes us realize the precariousness of our own dwell ings, of our lives: the weakness of our doors and roofs against the penetrative power of the moon, storms and night. This inhuman ecology is a part of our Zombie Oriented Ontology, one in which we realize it is not simply the human body that is an assemblage of discordant, agential and envitalized objects, but the earth itself. "Undead" means "differently alive." The very ground we walk upon, our future tomb, is alive in its supposed inertness, forever on the move, a foundation as well as our ruin, the undead material from which we construct our worlds. JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS</page><page sequence="14">410 • Jeffrey Jerome Cohen The undead have always been spurs to art. The Old Man in Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale is a kind of zombie, one to whom death is denied. He is wholly extraneous to the narrative, yet haunts because he is so captivating, so vital. Coleridge's Ancient Mariner is a similar figure. But even more recent zombies can be such catalysts, despite their inability to speak in iambic pentameter, despite their seeming lack of artistic power. A symphony of flowing crimson and body parts autonomously alive, the zombie aesthetic is disturbing, and that means it can be inspiring: it is fruitful to think with. Yet in the end I wish we could have our zombies without desiring so ardently an apocalypse to go with them. Apocalypse is ultimately a failure of the imagination. Apocalypse signals giving up on the future instead of committing to the difficult work of composing a better present. Those who dream of the purgation of our prob lems rather than commit to the labor of repair choose an easier path. No wonder the zombies destroy them. To be undead might mean something more than to inhabit a terminal world, a vastness reduced to earthbound despair. Zombies without apocalypse might offer a future in which we recognize the suffering, the possibilities, the potency and the dignity of our fellow humans and our fellow nonhumans alike.
