APRIL 10, 1913 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS "THE NEW REALISM"'1 THOUGH the polemic spirit has for some time filled the air of philosophy, the numerous marches and countermarches can not be said to have proved decisive. As the walls of philosophy re- fuse to fall at the mere flourish of trumpets, there has been little change in the status quo. Every one, therefore, interested in genu- ine philosophic progress will welcome this volume and its well-or- ganized attempt to advance the position outlined in the "Plat- form." 2 Unless, however, I am very much mistaken, the authors of this book may be-pleasantly or unpleasantly-surprised at being welcomed by many idealists, who will regard them, not as hostile in- vaders, but as much-needed immigrants taking possession of the abandoned or undeveloped soil and rendering it fruitful for the com- mon good. Perhaps the authors of this book may resent this attempt to minimize the importance of the destructive mission of their "class consciousness," but I think philosophers generally are more fortu- nate in delivering the positive burden of their own vision than in their denial of the vision of others. The polemic consciousness is not in any of its forms conducive to complete justice, and history is full of examples of philosophers, like Aristotle, attacking most ve- hemently those most closely related to them. It is indeed a wise philosopher who knows his own true opponent. Now neo-realism looks upon idealism3 as the great enemy, because as a matter of IA Review of "The New Realism: Cooperative Studies in Philosophy" by Edwin B. Holt, Walter T.

The essence of idealism, as that term has been used in philosophy, literature, art, politics, etc., is that the structure of the universe justifies certain values, called ideals, and with that doctrine the authors of this book have no quarrel whatsoever. They are fighting epistemologic subjectivism; but for some unac- countable reason they always call it idealism. That this use of the word idealism involves unusual violence to the facts of history, e. g., in the implication that 197</page><page sequence="2">198 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fact the former movement originated in a reaction against such types of idealism as is embodied in Bradley 's "Appearance and Reality" and Strong's "Why the Mind Has a Body." When, how- ever, one disregards the accidental starting point and judges neo- realism by its fundamental tendency, the opposition between realism and dualistic or psychologic pragmatism will be seen to be of far greater significance. Between a position which would regard every- thing in terms of the subject and a position which would regard every- thing as objective, there may be very little or no theoretic difference, for the same laws or relations may hold between "'experiences" as between "independent reals," i. e., the distinction between different classes of entities may be the same in the two systems. Between a view, however, which insists that the propositions of logic and mathe- matics are as real or objective (i. e., independent of "mind") as those of physics, and a view which denies to objects of thought the ontologic status of objects of sense, the issue is significant, and, it seems to me, laden with momentous consequences. I regard, there- fore, the problem of the reality of universals, "the things of thought, " as the central question which this volume raises. It is not, then, so much Berkeley's subjectivism (about which there is consid- erable doubt) as his nominalism that presents the significant alter- native to the neo-realist position. At any rate, if Professor Marvin's paper proves its point, the epistemologic issue can not be the funda- mental one, but must yield in fundamental importance to issues of fact or theories of being. Nominalism, the denial of " reality" to relations, abstractions, etc., is based on the conscious or unconscious assumption of the an- cient dogma that only a whole can really exist and that which is a part (in intension) can not have independent existence. The es- sence of neo-realism, the object's independence of our apprehension of it, as developed by Professor Perry, would be utterly impossible on a nominalistic metaphysic, and so would Professor Spaulding's doetrine of analytic realism. At any rate, it is a significant fact that the one positive doetrine which all the six authors find themselves compelled to use in their arguments, is the non-mental character of the propositions of logic and mathematics.4 There is, to be sure, a certain hesitation in the author 's repudiation of nominalism (e. g., p. 58) .5 While in general they "accord full on- an idealist like Hegel is an epistemologic subjectivist, ought to be clear to all stu- dents of the history of philosophy. But this is a minor matter, if the sympa- thetic reader will simply substitute the word subjectivism wherever the authors use the word idealism. 4Marvin, pages 57 if., Perry, pages 129 if., Spaulding, pages 204-205, Mon- tague, pages 261-2, Holt, pages 363 ff. and page 472, Pitkin, pages 445 ff. 5 The word nominalism does not occur in the index.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 199 tological status to things of thought," logical and mathematical enti- ties are denied the claim to existence, but are put in the undefined but spacious realm of subsistence. I can not, however, but regard the dis- tinction between existence and subsistence-which the authors have borrowed from Russell-as merely a temporary or provisional make- shift. Certain sensible or physical terms in time and space are re- garded as existents, and all other possible or impossible objects of thought are subsistents. This, like most dichotomous divisions, can hardly be expected to be of much use; for it puts too many things in the negative class (in this case, the class of subsistents). The ques- tion is important, because the facile division of objects into existent and subsistent tends to obscure the fundamental problem or re- quirement of any constructive philosophy, viz., a systematic classifi- cation of reals, or doctrine of categories. To the neglect of this problem may be ascribed a great deal of the misunderstanding and futility of modern philosophic controversy. The distinction between existence and subsistence arises from a certain requirement in the modern philosophy of mathematics, viz., that mathematical propositions shall have a meaning which is non- psychologic and non-physical. Russell expresses this fact by saying that mathematical entities must be non-mental and non-existential. IHence the term subsistence to cover those entities. The restriction, however, of the term existence to sensible objects, which this termin- ology implies, leads to considerable confusion in the neo-realist phi- losophy.6 Russell's statement repeated by Marvin (p. 85) that the non-existential character of mathematics is one of the greatest dis- coveries of the nineteenth century, is, of course, true. But what it means is simply that mathematical propositions are formal, and their truth is independent of the truths of physics. Mathematical entities, then, are not physical, but they certainly have being as much as physical entities do. What reason can there be, outside of a nominalistic metaphysic, for denying the existence of one and not of the other? Moreover, the restriction of the existential predicate to sensible terms gives rise to confusion in the realm where the dis- tinction between existence and subsistence first arose, viz., mathe- matics. When a mathematician proves an existence theorem, e. g., that everv equation of the nth degree has n roots, he surely estab- 'Russell says: "Except space and time themselves, only those objects exist which have to particular points of space and time the special relation of occupy- ing them," (Mind, 1904, page 211). I take it that Russell means to predicate existence of those things only which occupy both time and space; so that things occupying time only, e. g., misunderstandings of realism, do not exist. Moreover, in the light of other utterances, Russell probably means that only points of space and time exist, but that the series denoted by the terms time and space, like existence itself, do not exist.</page><page sequence="4">200 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lishes something more than the subsistence of these n roots, for the n + 4th root of the same equation has according to the neo-realists canon (Montague, p. 253) subsistence though demonstrably no ex- istence. The difficulty here raised does not seem to be sufficiently met by Russell 's contention that mathematical existence denotes something totally (i. e., generically) different from physical exist- ence. For, if mathematical existence is only a kind of subsistence, it is surely of the utmost importance to distinguish between the sub- sistence of the nth root and the subsistence of the n + 4th root. In- stead, then, of inquiring into the kinds of existence, we have to in- quire into the kinds or grades of subsistence. Is it true, however, that mathematical and physical existences are so generically different that they have nothing in common? For one thing the determination of physical existence is frequently, if not always, based on mathematical existence. Moreover, the manner in which mathematical and physical existences are determined is ex- actly the same. Take the questions: Is there a root to every equa- tion? Is there a maximum velocity in the physical universe? Is there a special sex-determining factor in the germ cell? Did Moses have a real (historical) existence? Now in all these significant ques- tions, the existence or non-existence of the entities in question is de- termined, in their respective sciences, not by reference to the ques- tion whether they are mental, but by reference to their relation to the body of propositions which form the sciences in question.7 What reason can there be, on realistic ground, for saying that roots and velocities have no existence, but that the other entities do? Does it not seem that what we need is a fuller account of the different levels or types of existence? This question of the distinction between existence and subsistence is an illustration of the truth of the authors' contention (pp. 21-22) that care in the use of words is really important. An adequate doc- trine of categories would do away with a great many of the difficul- ties which Montague, for instance, finds in the existence of error and hallucinatory objects. (This does not hold of Holt's theory). Errors and false propositions do undoubtedly exist in this world, if any- thing does. The significant question is how do they exist, i. e., to what type of existence do they belong. Many people, for instance, will find unconvincing Spaulding's arguments for the existence of points in space, or of atoms in material bodies, and will find good reasons for their unbelief. This situation arises from the fact that points are non-spatial (i. e., non-extended) and atoms non-material (i. e., devoid of the ordinary properties of matter). Points and I This point is missed by most critics of realism, e. g., Professor Pratt, this JOURNAL, Vol. IX., page 579.</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 201 atoms, then, do not have the kind of existence of space and matter; and unless this distinction is clearly recognized, both the affirmative and the negative positions seem equally tenable or untenable. In the light of a developed doctrine of categories, also, the distinc- tion between discovery and invention, between finding and making, which dominates neo-realism in its present stage, may turn out not to be as thoroughgoing as it appears in the light of current contro- versy. The distinction in question is certainly valid for a great many types of reality. There is a real logical opposition between discover- ing and inventing a polar continent. But did the Romans invent or discover their jurisprudence? Did the authors of this book invent or discover the neo-realist philosophy? These questions suggest the possibility of a realm where invention and discovery overlap, or cease to be clearly antithetic terms. The authors' own statement (pp. 2-10) of the historical signifi- cance of neo-realism seems rather unfortunate. The account in question reads too much like an Hegelian a priori history, with its distinct stages each by a dialectic process giving rise to its successor. I regard it as unfortunate because it is not likely to discourage crit- ics from dealing with neo-realism as a new epistemology, whereas it is really a return to a mode of thought in which the epistemologic specter need not trouble us. Take, for instance, the theory of error. The authors (and their critics, like Professor Lovejoy) assume that the first method of explaining error is by the introduction of mind or consciousness. That, however, is not the fact, for this action of consciousness as a disturbing medium seems to have been suggested by the modern use of lenses. The earlier attempt to explain error, found alike among the Hindoos and Greek philosophers, is to give error a kind of secondary or shadowy existence of its own. Maya is not due merely to consciousness, but is a sort of maze or fog which surrounds the real, and "the way of error" in Parmenides is cer- tainly not "the way of consciousness." The neo-realist doctrine of error (as briefly indicated in the essays of Holt and Pitkin) will, in fact, be found to begin where the Greeks left off, and to develop the ancient method in a form consonant with the requirements of mod- ern science. The one modern movement with which neo-realism is closely allied (in motive, at least), is radical empiricism. James was profoundly dissatisfied with the prevailing nominalism, and saw that it must logically lead to a hopeless and lifeless atomism. James tried to re- store in philosophy the fluency of things, by giving relations, transi- tions, etc., a psychologic status. Neo-realism aims at the same re- sults, but turns its back on any attempt to construct the world out of psychologic states. In the light of modern mathematical research, it</page><page sequence="6">202 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY returns to the Aristotelian insight that what is prior in knowledge need not be prior in nature, and thus re-opens the path of progress along which all the objective sciences have been going, but which has been shut to philosophy by the specters of epistemology. II The logical and historical introduction to ueo-realism is to be found in Professor Marvin's essay on "The Emancipation of Meta- physics from Epistemology." The neo-realist movement is a "reac- tion against the whole enterprise of Locke, Kant, and their follow- ers, to get a fundamental science, and not merely against their ideal- ism. Neo-realism is not only a different theory of knowledge, but, what is more important for metaphysics, a different doctrine as to the place of epistemology in the hierachy of the sciences" (p. 51). Professor Marvin does well to thus refer to Locke as the father of criticism, for Kant's boastful claim often makes us forget that it was Locke who first set in fashion the view that we must examine the nature of knowledge before "we let loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of being." 8 Professor Marvin's attack, however, is directed more particularly against the Kantian view of an a priori science of knowledge as the necessary prerequisite for metaphysics. To offset epithet criticism, Professor Marvin adopts the admirable device of calling his position dogmatism and opposing it to criticism. Kant's assumption of the possibility of a science or "critique" which can determine a priori the nature, possibility, and limits of knowledge, is really untenable; for epistemology can function only if it assumes that we already are in possession of valid knowledge, and this knowl- edge, as a matter of fact, it borrows from logic, psychology, etc. The "possibility" of mathematics, physics, or metaphysics is far less questionable than the possibility of epistemology. The neo-Kantian may reply: "Of course we must assume that we are in possession of valid knowledge in order to proceed at all. But Kant never sup- poses that the validity of science is in need of proof. The significant question for him is, What are the conditions which make valid knowledge possible?" To which we may answer, that this way of putting the question is inconsistent with the claim of epistemology as an a priori science more fundamental than metaphysics or psy- chology, for the actual conditions of valid knowledge can be deter- mined only on the basis of logical, psychological, or metaphysical data. Indeed, Kant himself really does assume a particular system of psychology of various "faculties," and certain definite views of reality in order to work out his deductions of the categories and 8 Essay I., ch. I., sec. 7.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 203 other parts of his critique of pure reason. This Kantian metaphys- ics may be valid. What Professor Marvin is intent on proving is that it does not follow from, but, on the contrary, is the basis of Kant's epistemology. The same may be said of the neo-Hegelian metaphysics of Greene and his followers, which they claim rests on an examination of the nature of knowledge. The history of science showvs no important scientific advance or metaphysical progress due to epistemology. On the contrary, whatever influence the latter has exerted on the former seems to have been pernicious. The various sciences and metaphysics, therefore, are and by right ought to be, free and independent of the sovereignty of epistemology, and tbey may go on to develop their fields without waiting for the issue of a permit by the science of epistemology. This, I take it, is the gist of Professor Marvin's careful and most conscientiously worked out argument. It seems so cogent and un- answerable that it arouses a very distressing reflection, why has phi- losophy so long failed to note this? Marvin's argument has been, in part at least, made by such different writers as Hegel9 and the Frie- sian school,10 but the intellectual world, without stopping to refute these arguments, has calmly ignored them. Even the positive sci- ences now feel it incumbent upon them to pay their respects to Erkenntnistheorie, while metaphysics is considered as belonging to the intellectual underworld. Nay, even Professor Marvin himself subscribes to the statement of his colleagues that the epistemologic question "is prior to all other philosophic issues" (p. 10). Perhaps, however, the line between neo-realism and criticism is not as sharp as Professor Marvin draws it. What Kant calls trans- cendental method is not very much different in essence from that which Marvin calls logical analysis and which, he maintains, is inde- pendent of psychology. The more fundamental difference, I venture to think, lies elsewhere, viz., in the conception of the realm of meta. physics. Kant's metaphysic is essentially anti-evolutionary, a priori, and incapable of progress. "Pure speculative reason," he tells us, "is able to give a complete enumeration of the possible modes of pro- posing problems to itself, and thus sketch out the entire system of metaphysics"; and again, metaphysics, by means of criticism, "can take in the whole sphere of its cognitions, and can thus complete its work, and leave it for the use of posterity, as a capital which can never receive fresh accessions. " 11 If we no longer believe reality to be such a closed and limited system, then we must give up the at- 9 Eneyklopidie, ? 41. 10 Nelson, "Uber das sogenannte Erkenntnisproblem. " "Preface to 2d ed. K. R. V., page xxiii.</page><page sequence="8">204 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tempt to deduce it a priori and complete from the nature of knowl- edge as such. This anti-evolutionary view in the background of criticism ex- plains why the most blighting effects of criticism have been felt by such young growing sciences as sociology and jurisprudence.'2 Work- ers in these fields are distracted at the outset by purely formal prob- lems, as what is the nature of social science, its method, its object, its limits, etc., etc. But there is no way of finding the limits of a science except by actually developing it first. Epistemologic criticism is applicable to science only when the latter is in a state of relative com- pletion, e. g., in certain fields of mathematics and physics. Then questions of procedure, the convenience of hypotheses, etc., have a definite meaning. But such considerations must follow and can not precede the constructive stage. The elimination of "critical" epistemology leaves the field clear for constructive metaphysics. Now, unlike most recent philosophic procedures, neo-realism takes modern physical science seriously, or, if you please, naa;vely. It does not regard it as a "mere construction of the mind," a more or less useful falsehood, but as a valid method of discovering the constitution of reality. Hence, in adoptino the mathematical or analytic method of science as also valid for phi- losophy, ueo-realism finds itself under the guns of men like Bradley and Bergson, who deny that analysis can enable us to reach ultimate reality, and insist that it must necessarily falsify the real. Hence the need for Spaulding's essay, "A Defence of Analysis," "as a method of knowing which discovers entities or parts which are real in quite the same sense as are the wholes which are analyzed " (p. 155). The neo-realist is quite willing to admit that the actual analy- ses which men make are selected from a larger number of possible ones, but this does not prove that they are falsifications. If there are more parts or further divisions than those employed in our analysis, it does not follow that our analysis is false: it may be true as far as it goes. As the opponents of analysis do themselves employ analysis in their attempt to prove their contention, it is at least doubtful whether all analysis can be false qua analysis. Professor Spaulding, therefore, examines in detail the various types of analysis, viz., that of aggregates, classes, and organic unities, and shows that in each case the objections are invalid. An aggregate is analyzed by enumeration, i. e., by naming the parts and the conjunctive relation. Why is this falsification? Be- cause, says Bergson, there is no genuine plurality in nature itself, 12 See Cosentini, in Revue Int. de Sociologie, Jan., 1913, and Fragpane, "Obbietto e limite della filosofia del diritto," II., pages 77-83.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 205 but all things interpenetrate.'3 This assumption, however, of a uni- v,ersal interpretation is a mere snap judgment or violent generaliza- tion without adequate evidence. Any evidence for interaction must, of course, begin by recognizing different things which interact. Under the analysis of classes Spaulding includes the analysis of number, space, time, motion, velocity, and acceleration, and such classes of individuals as atoms, electrons, etc. The attack on this kind of analysis is stated by Bergson in a form the logic of which is identical with that of Zeno's attack on motion. According to this attack analysis breaks up space into non-extended points, time into unenduring moments, and motion into a series of rests. But these supposed parts are the contradictions of the given wholes. Therefore is analysis falsification. To which Professor Spaulding justly replies that this attack ignores and misstates the actual results of modern analysis. The divisibility of continuous space does not lead to dis- creteness, but, on the contrary, defines definitely what is meant by continuity; and, in the same way, it is not true that modern analysis resolves motion into a series of rests. In its account of analysis, this attack leaves out the organizing relations. While points, for ex- ample, are non-extended, there is no contradiction in saying that space is a class of points between which certain relations hold. " Con- sider both terms and relations and the properties of the whole which may be left over, but which are revealed by analysis, and the analysis becomes adequate at the same time that there is opportunity for that 'creative evolution,' for that creative synthesis which some of the attacking party emphasize so strongly, but which is not dependent, for its acceptance, upon the validity of the attack" (p. 168.) Organic unities are distinguished by the fact that they are wholes possessing properties which are not the sum of the properties of the parts. This, however, is not confined, as is usually supposed, to organisms. There are some qualities in a compound like water which can not be obtained by adding the qualities of the components. But whether the parts modify each other when united, or whether new organizing relations arise when the parts are united as they were not before, in either case scientific analysis or synthesis is adequate to reveal the real change in nature. The introduction of entelechies to distinguish organisms from inorganic physico-chemical complexes is either scientifically pernicious or unnecessary, according to whether the entelechies do or do not introduce an element of indeterminism. A supervening awareness may occur, and "it is good rea]ism to admit that it may, " but it can not be used as a principle of explanation. The attack on conceptual analysis as conceptional, is based on the "3'"Creative Evolution," pages 11, 162, 188, 338, 340.</page><page sequence="10">206 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY argument that concepts are necessarily static and inadequate to grasp change or process. But why assume that only like entities can be related? The concept of divisibility need not be divisible. At any rate, there is no real contradiction in a definite or fixed concept of a flow, and Bergson himself uses concepts to denote the three kinds of change. In this connection Professor Spaulding briefly indicates (p. 233) four important characteristics of concepts, or "states of affairs." These will well bear more extensive development in a future paper. It must be conceded, I think, that Professor Spaulding's very la- borious arguments show the utter flimsiness of the attack on analysis, so far as the latter is based on the argument that analysis of space, time, or motion leads to contradiction. This last argument simply ignores the fact that modern mathematics by its analysis of infinity and continuity has definitely solved Zeno 's puzzles. Besides the change of contradiction comes with bad grace from those who are skeptical about the force of logical contradiction when it is applied to their own doctrines. Nevertheless, there is an element of real force in the contention that analysis is by itself inadequate to give us a com- plete account of space, time, and motion, and that resort to intui- tion is necessary. Mathematical analysis can reveal to us only the formal or structural properties of such entities as space. Having started with a number of postulates relating to indefinable "points," the properties deduced will be the same if these "points" are num- bers, ideal citizens of an ideal commonwealth, or what not, so long as the defining relations hold between them. What distinguishes physi- cal space from any other possible interpretation of S (mathematical space) can, therefore, be grasped only by intuition. Spaulding's statement (following Russell) that "points" are spatial is hardly warranted by his own analysis, in which "points" are necessarily (not "probably") indefinable. Professor Spaulding also seems to forget that space is not determined solely as a point collection; it may also be constituted in diverse other ways, e. g., as a four-dimensional collection of lines, in which the lines are the simple elements and points complexes formed by the intersection of lines. This, of course, in no way militates against the validity of any of these analyses of space. The same thing may be correctly expressed in different sets of units without damage to realism. But reflection on these consider- ations, enables one to understand some of the motives of those to whom the world appears more fluid than to Professor Spaulding. Indeed, there is a hard and fast finality about some of the latter's statements which is hardly warranted by the present state of science, e. g., the statement that points presuppose numbers (p. 174) is certainly not</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 207 true if we restrict ourselves to projective geometry. In his realistic zeal, also, Professor Spaulding seems to me to obliterate the distinc- tion between hypothesis and fact, as in his argument for the reality of atoms. It is well to take science seriously, but why should philoso- phers be compelled to take scientific hypotheses more seriously than scientists themselves do? Why pin the hope of our salvation on atoms when leading chemists like Ostwald, Duhem, and others can get along without them? Moreover, many scientists who profess their allegiance to the atomic hypothesis do so merely as a matter of form. Take any text-book on crystallography, on the phase rule, or on any branch of thermodynamics. You may find a good deal said at the beginning about the atomic constitution of matter; but when the real work begins all that is silently disregarded, and integration formulae are introduced which presuppose the continuity of matter. Indeed, the attitude of most working scientists to-day to the atomic and other regnant theories is very much like that of the AMexican governor who is reported to have said: "I owe allegiance to what- ever brigand is duly elected president, but first of all I must main- tain order in my own province." Whatever objections may be brought against this view, it at least saves us from the extremes of anarchy and vicious absolutism. Professor Perry's essay, "A Realistic Theory of Independence," is a painstaking attempt to define the distinctive epistemologic doc- trine of neo-realism. The new realism differs from the old realism of Reid in giving up the doctrine of a substance behind the qualities. (I am not sure whether Professor Montague always does so.) Its distinctive note is that the object is independent of the knower. What does this mean? It does not mean, we are told, the absence of any relation between the object and our knowledge, nor does the neo- realist even wish to deny that knowledge may be in some sense prior to the object. By the term independent we are to understand simply the absence of certain specific relations which constitute dependence. "In order to prove the dependence of a on b it is necessary to show that a contains b; or that a is the cause or effect of b in a system which exclusively determines a; or that a implies b; or that a is implied ex- clusively by b. To exhibit any relation of a to b other than these is beside the point. Whether a and b be otherwise related, or not, does not affect the independence of a" (p. 117). It is clear that with this definition of dependence our opponent will never be able to prove the dependence of the object on consciousness; for, if it can be shown that the object is in any way determined by something else, it can no longer be said to be exclusively determined by consciousness and is, therefore, independent. On the other hand,</page><page sequence="12">208 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY so far as this definition goes, one may believe that consciousness modi- fies every real and yet maintain that the latter is independent of the former-which would make it seem as if the chief novelty of neo- realism on this point is the use of the word independent in an unusual sense. Indeed, the proposed definition of independence is not only somewhat unusual, but even directly contrary to popular use which conceives what is included, implied, caused, or explained as the de- pendent term rather than that which contains, implies, causes, or ex- plains (p. 115). Certainly a use of the term dependence which makes the premises of a syllogism depend on the conclusion (p. 121) involves some violence to ordinary usage. The neo-realist, of course, has a perfect right to define his terms in any way he pleases; but as he can not change the flavor which words earry along with them, some confusion is bound to result. The really vital point of Professor Perry's argument, however, consists in the elimination of the ego-centric predicament, by showing that the ubiquity of the knowledge relation is irrelevant in the de- termination of the real. Indeed, scientific procedure depends on this very ability to show that a condition may be irrelevant even tbough it is always present. "It is the task of science to distinguish within a total manifold those factors which do count and those which do not." Thus, e. g., the equality of the ratios between the sides of a triangle and the sines of the opposite angles is discovered in a larger context containing, among other things, the absolute magnitude of the sides; but though present, the absolute magnitude does not count. Similarly, "when Galileo discovered that acceleration was a function of the time of a body's fall, he discovered that it was not a function of the body 's weight or volume. And to establish this it was not necessary for him to obtain an instance of a body without weight or volume; it was sufficient for him to show that the factors, although present, did not enter into the calculation" (p. 132). From this it clearly follows that an object may enter into or go out of the cognitive situation with- out losing its independence. In the concluding portion of this essay, Professor Perry examines various cases of "subjectivity," and concludes that the whole realm of value, art, history, society, life, etc., is dependent on consciousness, though independent of reflective or secondary conscious relations with which it may enter. This admission or qualification may mini- mize the issue between realism and "idealism"; but the critical on- looker may well ask whether it does not prejudice the argument in the earlier portion of the essay. Where is the difference in point of objectivity or independence between a proposition of mathematics and one of economics? Many judgments of value are purely logical or</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 209 mathematical. The test is laid down that "in so far as any given object is deducible otherwise than from consciousness, it is independ- ent of consciousness" (p. 135) ; and from this it is argued that if the mean velocity of Jupiter can be deduced from the gravitational sys- tem without reference to cognition it must be considered independent of the latter. But is not the economic value of a thing in the same way determined, not by reference to cognition, but by its quality, quantity, cost of production, etc? It would be a pity if Professor Perry's view, that judgments of value have not the same objectivity as judgments of mathematics or logic, were to lead to the view that neo-realism has no message for ethics or philosophy of life. To at least one reader of this volume the great promise of neo-realism is precisely in the latter direction. The great confusion and futility of social theory to-day seems to me to result from the attempt to build up a social philosophy on a nominal- istic logic. Nominalistic logic must inevitably lead to atomistic individualism and to a psychology of moments or "states," as can be seen in the history of ethics from Antisthenes to Bentham or Spencer. By emphasizing the reality of universals or "organizing relations," by recognizing the latter as real causes, neo-realism supplies a much- needed aid to the analysis of the larger life. Professor Perry and his colleagues frequently speak of absolute simples. It is worth while raising the issue whether there are such things. The argument is advanced that analysis, i. e., the recognition of complexes, presupposes the existence of simples. But obviously this simplicity is always relative to a specific complex. In another context this simple term may itself be very complex. Smith may be a simple unit for purposes of vital statistics, but infinitely complex to his teacher, business partner, or sweetheart. A point is a simple entity in our ordinary three-dimensional space, but a complex in line geometry; and so, atoms, electrons, the color green, etc., are simples in certain contexts and complex in others. Even logical ideas like "implication," "disjunction," "negation," etc., can be simple ideas in one system, and complex in another. (Compare the indefinables of Russell's "Principles of Mathematics" with those of the "Principia Mathematica. ") The foregoing three essays may be considered as an attempt to clear the ground and indicate the method for a constructive meta- physic. Thus considered they represent the necessary common ground for the six writers. The remaining three essays are devoted to a special problem which arises on this common ground, viz., the nature of consciousness and error. As the solutions which Professors Montague, Holt, and Pitkin offer differ from each other, and as</page><page sequence="14">210 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY in the present temper of philosophic discussion this topic is certain to receive more than its due share of attention, it is not necessary to review it here in detail. In his suggestive essay, "a Realistic Theory of Truth and Error," Professor Montague approaches the problem from a modified form of his theory which identifies consciousness with potential energy. Consciousness consists of the self-transcending implications which the brain-states sustain to their extra-organic causes (or effects). "Now if we single out some one event and inquire as to its cause, we shall find a plurality of possible antecedents, any one of which if it had not been counteracted would have produced it. . . . It follows from this that the implicate or conscious object of any brain state may be, but need not be, an event which actually exists" (p. 287). According, then, as the implicates are real things or their contradic- tories we have truth or error. The anthropomorphic or "'common sense" view of causality which this theory involves is of such limited application that Professor Montague is sure to encounter considerable trouble in convincing others of its adequacy. Professor Pitkin, for one, is convinced that implication or meaning is of much wider extent than causality, e. g., the triangle implies [in Euclidean space] a constant sum of interior angles; but the angles are neither the cause nor the effect of the triangle (p. 485). It seems as if Professor Montague, the pioneer of neo-realism in this country, is in danger of being considered a reac- tionary by his more progressive or radical brethren. Thus, he refuses to accept the relational formula which would explain the real exist- ence of an optically bent but tactually straight stick. He does not allow hallucinatory objects to invade the "real" world, and lapses into such traditional utterances as "my awareness of objects is more certainly real than anything else" (p. 269), and "we are more cer- tain of our own thoughts and feelings than of anything else" (p. 290). In spite of the fact that he clearly points out that it is not because of any character of belief, but "because of what is believed that the belief is true or false," he is not willing to accept the view that truth or falsehood are qualities of certain objects or complexes. In common with Professor Spaulding and perhaps several other of his colleagues, Professor Montague holds to the priority of empty time and space over the content which fills it. No proof is offered for this position, nor does it seem necessary for the realistic position. Realism does not seem inconsistent with the view that time is the measure of motion, and space a way of coordinating positions. Meta- physicians who assume an absolute time or space should at least reckon with the recent relativity theory of Einstein and Minkowski-</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 211 the only theory which satisfactorily explains the Michaelson-Morley experiments. According to this theory the time interval is just as relative to the point of observation as the angle which a line subtends. Any one who is inclined to think that realism tends in the direc- tion of materialism will find much food for thought in Professor Montague's keen criticisms of panhylism (pp. 269-272, and 277). Professor Pitkin in stating the agreement between Professors Mon- tague, Holt, and himself says: "Whatever consciousness is, it is somehow connected with the activity of getting 'beyond space and time'; that is, of adjusting variously to events beyond the organ- ism's own skin and to conditions more than material" (p. 485). As original and constructive contributions to philosophy, quite apart from the realistic thesis, the essays of Professors Holt and Pitkin seem to me the most important in this volume. Professor Holt 's remarkably well-organized attack on the theory of specific nerve energy cuts at the root of a good deal of the vain speculation which has overrun modern psychologic philosophy; and Professor Pitkin's effort at evolving a new system of categories wherewith to express our biologfic experience will go far to remove the light- hearted reliance on the categories of popular biology which are fre- quently nothing but the remnants of outworn metaphysical systems. Limitations of space, however, and regard for the main current which runs through all the essays, make only scant treatment of them possible. Some neo-realists and all their critics seem to feel that the problem of error is a crucial one for neo-realism. I confess that while the problem is one of the utmost importance, I can not see that it is pecul- iarly a problem for the realist any more than for anybody else-and most modern schools have dodged it. If we maintain, as any analysis of scientific procedure compels us, that a proposition is true or false not because we make it or believe it, but because of what is asserted in it, or because of the relation it bears to other propositions, then it seems to follow that truth and falsehood are equally independent of the consciousness in which they appear. At any rate, there is no evidence from science that the line between the true and the false, the real and the erroneous, is identical with that between the non- mental and the mental. The denial of the realistic position, therefore, can be made only on the basis either that all objects are mental or that only unreal objects are of mental origin. The former does not explain the difference between the true and the false, and the latter admits the non-mental character of real objects. Be that as it may, it is a fact that the existence of non-mental but illusory objects is generally considered paradoxical; and Pro-</page><page sequence="16">212 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fessor Holt's essay, "The Place of Illusory Experience in a Realistic World," tries to meet the objections on this ground. The argument that in the case of an illusory object the person sees what is not there, hence the act of seeing is constitutive of the object, is met by showing many physical processes of copying, by cameras, etc., which reproduce the same distortions or reduplications of the objects concerned. There is, therefore, every reason to suppose that the distortion or reduplication is due not to consciousness, but to the physical relation between the sense-organs and the object. Thus the relativity of secondary qualities, the production of negative or complementary after-images, etc., are paralleled by the action of thermometers, the receiving mast of a wireless telegraph system, etc. To the argument that the outside world contains only primary qualities and vibration rates, and that the secondary qualities must be aroused in the mind by specific nerve energies, Professor Holt, after thoroughly refuting the specific nerve-energy theory, produces a new hypothesis which attempts to deduce the secondary qualities from the frequency inter- val of nerve pulses or vibration, and thus reduce them to a genuine part of the objective order. As this hypothesis will probably be seen to greater advantage in his forthcoming book on "The Concept of Consciousness," discussion of it had better be postponed for the present. It is enough to indicate that it attempts to solve the problem of illusory objects by showing "that the nervous system, even when unstimulated from without, is able to generate within itself nerve currents of those frequencies whose density factor is the same as in ordinary peripheral stimulation (p. 352) ; hence the illu- sory object with its secondary qualities is a genuine part of the physical system. The failure to work out clearly a theory of types or levels of existence gives the neo-realist assertion in regard to the objectivity of illusory objects the appearance of self-contradiction. It seems to say that these illusory or unreal objects are true or real.14 The reader, however, must not interpret the argument that illusory objects are objective, non-mental, or parts of the physical world, to mean that they are true or existent reals, for the neo-realist does not believe that the objective is necessarily existent; it may merely have being or sub- sistence. Nor has the illusory object the quality of being true. In the subsistent world all sorts of contradictory or opposite propositions are found side by side. It is only when we limit ourselves to "ex- istent'" entities that contradictory propositions can no longer be applicable (p. 366). (As thus used the term "existent" covers not 14 It is so misunderstood by Professor MeGilvary, Philosophical Review, Vol. XXII., page 64, line 8.</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 213 only physical and mental terms, but also mathematical entities whose existence is demonstrated). Of great significance is Professor Holt's criticism of Mr. G. E. Moore's view that consciousness and its objects are distinct existents, between which there is only the unresolvable relation of awareness. The latter view seems to be based on an undue emphasis on the quali- tative difference between the object and idea; thus, "fire burns, but the idea of fire does not," etc. Professor Holt's answer is, "Fire burns, but the shape of the flame does not. " Surely the two are not, therefore, two distinct entities. In his essay on "Some Realistic Implications of Biology," Pro- fessor Pitkin has attempted to introduce more material than can con- veniently be compressed within the 90 pages at his disposal. It is to be hoped that he will soon expand this into a respectable volume and thus, perhaps, render it easier for the reader. The main points which, as a result of his analysis of the biologic situation, he contributes to the realist position are: 1. The organism does not always modify the stimulus. As against Professor Dewey, for instance, it is maintained that " at least in some cases the eye activity does not condition the specific light-character of ether vibration, but only the distribution and em- ployment of these" (p. 417). 2. The doctrine of internal relations and what is often called the "organic" view of things find no support from the facts of biology. According to the "organic" view every part of an organic whole depends upon the whole and no part can be removed without destroying the whole. The facts of experimental biology flatly dis- prove this so far as natural organisms are concerned. 3. Planes, angles, numbers, ratios, and other such mathematical- geometrical characters are genuine stimuli. They are thus real causes. 4. The cognitive situation can be interpreted realistically by means of a very suggestive analogy from projective geometrv. Pro- fessor Pitkin thus tries to make clear "how errors, illusions, and hallucinations are not made by consciousness nor are peculiar to it, but are necessary features of a projected physical system" (p. 377). Attempts like these to dispense with old accredited categories and to invent new descriptions which will eliminate discredited meta- physical doctrines, make neo-realism appear excessively technical and complex. However, if we distinguish between the familiar and the simple, may not such an attempt lead to greater simplicity? Apart from its specific doctrines this book is bound to be influen- tial in raising the standard of philosophic workmanship. Many,</page><page sequence="18">214 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY doubtless, will be offended by the somewhat scant courtesy to all previous philosophy; and the promises of reform in the introduction will be regarded by many others like a set of New Year's resolutions, pious and necessary, but of doubtful efficacy. Few, however, will deny that the authors have done their work in a genuine scientific spirit. The book contains almost no rhetoric. There is no running loose with such catchwords as experiential, functional, dynamic, etc. Problems are minutely and patiently examined for their own sake, and not simply as points in a more or less subtile apology for supposed valuable human interests, like the belief in immortality, freedom, etc. The authors in the main resist the temptation to deal with wholesale affirmations or negations, but insist on a careful ex- amination of the various meanings and situations involved, thus tending to restore discrimination as a philosophic virtue. By thus submitting the things of thought to the same careful study as the things of sense receive in the physical sciences, the traditional dif- ference between empiricism and rationalism as methods is wiped out, and neo-realism may as well be called neo-rationalism or neo-em- piricism-differing from the older empiricism in recognizing the im- mediate reality of the "things of thought." Neo-realism is frankly intellectualistic and we may expect its op- ponents to call it neo-scholasticism, but scholasticism of a kind has always been needed to police the intellectual realm and check the riot of anarchic mysticism. The book before us is not likely to go through twelve editions within the next year or to receive the Nobel prize for "idealistic" literature. It lacks the sweep of popular assertions, and is written with conscientious regard for qualification and detail-often most painfully so. It brings no easy solution to the riddle of the uni- verse, and offers no texts for pulpit orations. But the discerning will regard it as a notable contribution to constructive philosophy.
