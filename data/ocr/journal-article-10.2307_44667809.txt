Pateel and S. Arumugasundaram University at Buffalo I. Hatziprokopiou General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems R. Galganksi Calspan Corporation Copyright © 2006 SAE International ABSTRACT This paper presents a simple method of accounting for input data uncertainties in computer models by propagating these uncertainties to output quantities of interest. Traditional Monte-Carlo methods are too expensive to apply to complex models of vehicle systems since each sample requires significant effort. The proposed method based on the theory of spectral expansions of the random variables requires an order of magnitude less effort. The methodology is applied to simulations of Child Restraint Systems (CRS) where statistics on the output quantities of Head Injury Criteria and strain at selected points in the CRS shell are evaluated under the assumption of uncertain input elastic modulus and friction parameters. INTRODUCTION Computational methods to model vehicle systems for safety or performance analysis usually assume that parameters and initial data are known exactly. Rarely does this assumption hold in practice. Thus, it is more realistic to treat these data stochastically. Over the last decade or so this approach has increased in popularity (see for e.g. Goldin et. al. [8] and commercial tools like the MADYMO Adviser [1] and ANSYS Design Explorer VT [9]). In all these approaches statistical description of desired output quantities are obtained based on statistical descriptions of model input data. However, most existing methods like Monte Carlo sampling that can account for variable data and parameters [5], are computationally intractable for complex non-linear models like those obtained in vehicle system modeling. For instance, the classical Monte Carlo method requires hundreds of thousands of simulations for accuracy, making it unaffordable for most realistic models without the use of supercomputer resources (see for e.g. Waterman and Reuter[4]) and tolerating significant error in the statistics of the output of interest. Given the computational challenges of MC sampling many researchers have sought alternative methodologies that reduce the computational demands. Stratified sampling methods like Latin Hypercube sampling [14], moment estimation driven sampling like the point estimate methods [13] and spectral chaos expansion methods [6,7] have proved to be efficient alternatives. In this paper, we describe a new approach developed by us in recent work and its application, to vehicle system modeling [11,15]. This method, named Polynomial Chaos Quadrature (PCQ), can be thought of as a hybrid of Monte Carlo sampling and the ideas of Polynomial Chaos [6]. Given a specification of the uncertainty in an input parameter (in terms of a probability distribution), this method allows us to estimate the probability distribution in output quantities of interest like maximum strains or head injury criteria (HIC) at computational costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable methods. After reviewing the basic methodology we will apply it to a series of validated computer models of anthropomorphic dummies in Child Restraint Systems (CRS) subjected to both crash and standard test loads. In particular, we will compute the effect of uncertainty in material properties of the CRS shell, stiffness of belts, and friction parameters in the different contact areas on specific outputs like the head injury criteria and strains in critical locations. Such characterization of output uncertainty as a function of input uncertainty will enable much better use of analysis in the design process. 1072</page><page sequence="2">METHODS FOR UNCERTAINTY PROPAGATION We will review now two of the principal methods for propagating input uncertainties in systems governed by partial differential equations. The first one is the classical Monte Carlo sampling method. We follow this by a description of polynomial chaos methodology and an extension that enables the easy solution of complex non-linear systems using the PC type method. MONTE CARLO METHODS Monte Carlo (MC) is the traditional (dates back to nuclear weapon simulation work in the 1940's) and most firmly established method of stochastic simulation; it is simply random sampling. The input probability density functions are sampled using a random number generator to construct a population of outputs. This population is then used to compute the statistics of interest [5]. MC is easy to implement and valid for almost all problems. However, the accuracy of the MC -1/2 expectation is a*(NMC) where NMC is the number of samples. For 3 significant figures of accuracy, the error = 0.001, Nmc= 1/(error)2 = 106 samples are required. Since each computer simulation provides one sample we need 106 simulations. One million runs of a 20 minute calculation running non stop on 64 processors would take 217 days and 20 minutes. MC is thus too computationally expensive for many applications including the one under study here ~ modeling of Child Restraint systems unless we accept significant error in the computation of the statistics. Clearly we require more efficient methodologies. We will now review the method of polynomial chaos and a simple extension that enables efficient application of this method to complex non-linear systems. POLYNOMIAL CHAOS The method is best explained by illustrating its application to a simple model problem. Consider a variable y(t,^) and a parameter k(%) satisfying the ordinary differential equation 4&amp;í) + *(4), (,,£)=&lt;&gt; at (1) where ^ is a random variable. Integrating (1) yif i » Š) = yifo &gt; £) - 'k(š)y{t, š)dt (2) y(t,š)=At&gt;š) Assume k(Š) = J kiy/i (£), y(Ç) =¿ y ^ ¡ (i) &lt;•= i j= i {vļ/,}, i=1..n is a set of suitably chosen orthogonal polynomials and n is a finite number - usually of the order of 4 to 6. In essence we have introduced a finite series expansion to approximate the probability density function (pdf) i.e. the chaos polynomial expansion. Convergence of the series in small n is crucial for the performance of the method. Karniadakis and Xu, [6] have established that for suitably chosen orthogonal polynomials matched to the nature of the pdf, convergence of the series to the true pdf can be exponential. The methodology to obtain the coefficients employs a Galerkin projection [7] as shown below.

The computational advantage 1 Nmc times in the MC based method to get the statistics 1073</page><page sequence="3">of doing so was proved by Karniadakis and Xu [6] among others, who showed that this method leads to results that require orders of magnitude less computation than MC based methods for the same level of accuracy in derived statistics. Note that complex nonlinearities in the equation will immediately transform into very complex expressions for the terms in (5). Solution of the coupled equation set can now become very difficult for the standard methods of solving such equations. Moreover existing computational tools cannot be used without extensive modification. A SIMPLE EXTENSION - POLYNOMIAL CHAOS QUADRATURE To avoid these difficulties we have devised a simple extension. We note that this modified method is somewhat similar in implementation to the classical empirically devised point estimate methods of Rosenblueth [13] and others. The starting point of this method is to replace exact integration in (4) with respect to £ by numerical quadrature. The familiar Gauss quadrature makes a good choice for most cases. This yields: M J ( n ' £ -jt TyjvAO n v-A) % &lt;H J J ^ M n n + £ £ k,¥, A )£ y jVj A )¥m A &gt;q = 0 q= 1 1=1 j= 1 where M is the number of quadrature points used.

Thus, this method is similar in implementation to the point estimate method. The coefficients of the expansion can be obtained from: J A 1 = £ bfro , 'l Aq K fe K ] (14) &lt; 1 ym Ci ) = £ be« A A )K A H ] (i 5) 9 To obtain only the moments we need not compute the coefficients and post-process as in PC but we can replace (13) by a simpler direct formula: e.g mean y is (T) = 'yA)dÇ = £ [c4 (16) 9 Formulas for standard deviation follow as &lt;t=a/|A)2^-Ť2 (17) If the quadrature is exact then (16) provides exactly the same results as the polynomial chaos method with n terms where n is the order of polynomial that is exactly integrated by the set of M quadrature points chosen for PCQ. PC has been shown to be superior to Monte Carlo methods in the work of Xiu and Karniadakis [6,15] using both convergence analysis and numerical testing. Thus, we can argue that PCQ will demonstrate performance superior to MC. Theoretical analysis of computational costs of the type presented for the MC is more difficult since the cost is now a function of the convergence of the chaos expansion to 1074</page><page sequence="4">the pdf of the output variable. If the output is a standard distribution and the polynomials are chosen to match (e.g. Hermite polynomials converge exponentially to normal distributions) then convergence is rapid. Since each evaluation of the G(t0,tpÇJ corresponds to one simulation we require M simulations for evaluating the mean (16) or each coefficient (15). We note that for Gaussian quadrature M points will exactly integrate a polynomial of order (/W-1)/2. Thus to integrate a 4lh order polynomial we need no more than 9 points i.e. 9 simulations will provide accuracy equal to that obtained by a 4,h order polynomial expansion of the random variable! For a normal distribution modeled by Hermite polynomials a 4th order approximation easily reduces the error below 1% [16]. As discussed earlier, when using an MC method such an error would require 10" simulations. On the other hand we note that when there are multiple random variables we need a product of the quadrature points along each dimension (corresponding to each random variable). Thus if we have s random variables we will require Ms quadrature points i.e. simulations. Clearly if the number of random variables is high, the advantages of this method are lost. APPLICATION AND RESULTS We will apply the methodology outlined above to the model of a CRS developed by us in earlier work [2,3]. Figure 1 describes the components of the model developed using the MADYMO tool [1], Figure 2 shows comparisons of the resultant acceleration in the torso of the Hybrid II dummy in test and simulation. Kinematic responses - accelerations and displacements generally correlate well. However, upon comparing the strain data we discovered that there was often great discrepancy between observed values and model predictions. Figure 3 illustrates the maximum principal strains from three HYGE Sled tests [2,3] and a MADYMO model output. We hypothesize that one of the reasons for this is the uncertainty in the value of the material parameters and its effect on the model computed strains. The material parameters for the shell of the CRS and the friction between the seat and dummy are difficult to determine with any degree of certainty. Instead of assuming values obtained from simple tests and/or handbooks we prescribe probability distributions for each of these parameters. We prescribe the Young's modulus for the CRS material as uniformly distributed between 1GPa and 2GPa and the friction coefficient between the CRS and the seat as uniformly distributed between 0.2 and 0.4. Figure 4 and 5 show the sensitivity of the strain at location 1 and 2 to different choices of Young's modulus for friction coefficients ranging from 0.2 to 0.4. The number of samples needed using the new method and two random variables is 85. Using Gaussian quadrature needed to integrate polynomials of 9th order we derive the 17 values of Young's modulus (1.004, 1.024, 1.059, 1.109, 1.171, 1.243, 1.324, 1.410, 1.5, 1.589, 1.675, 1.756, 1.8288, 1.89, 1 .9401 1 , 1 .97533, 1 .99528) GPa that we will use. Similarly we derive 5 values of friction based on Gaussian quadrature required to integrate 3rd order polynomials (0.20938, 0.246153, 0.3, 0.353847, 0.39061). All combinations of these yield the 85 combinations of parameters used in deriving our statistics. To compute the same statistics using MC and 1 % error would require 1 04 runs of the model i.e. 102 more runs. Since each run of the MADYMO model takes over 2 hours of run time on our top end desktop workstation the MC method is clearly computationally infeasible while the PCQ method is easily accomplished.

Material parameters for the CRS shell and friction between the dummy and seat are treated as uncertain input parameters, b) pictures of strain gage locations on CRS shell. Five critical locations are identified - three in the vicinity of the harness support and two on the main support frame. Figure 2.

HIC using either a 36 ms second window for computation [1] or the full simulation and strains at two locations on the CRS along with the maximums are presented. The first two columns of Table 1 illustrates the mean and standard deviations for the different quantities of interest obtained using (16) and (17) for HIC and peak strains at two sample locations. These statistics enable us to quantify the effect of the input data uncertainty. From the results it is clear that the HIC is well predicted and is not too sensitive to uncertainties in the Young's modulus and/or friction parameter. However, the strains reveal a much higher dependence. Simulation results for strain must therefore be treated with much more care. We notice that the standard deviation in column 2 of Table 1 is very high (as large as the mean) for the strain data at location 1 . Thus, the strain at this location is expected to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters and we do not expect good correlations with experimental data for any particular choice of parameters. The last two columns provide the maximum and minimums for the samples used in the computations. We postulate that from a designer point of view this information - mean, variations and extrema are more useful than the results from a single set of model parameters. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION We have presented in this paper a simple method for propagating input data uncertainties to specific output quantities of interest. Given a probability distribution of the input data we can obtain statistics on relevant output quantities of interest. The method is based on the theory of spectral expansions of random variables and retains the simplicity of the Monte Carlo methods but promises convergence rates that are significantly faster. For the case of CRS models we have illustrated the dependence of two sets of output quantities - HIC and peak strain at select locations on the uncertainty in the input variables of Young's modulus of the shell and friction parameter. For each of the output quantities we compute at reasonable effort means and standard deviations. These quantities can then be used in the safety evaluation or CRS design process. While, the method we propose here has significant advantages over the MC type methodology there are limitations when the number of random variables is large 1076</page><page sequence="6">since the number of samples needed rises exponentially. Secondly, the exact number of samples (e.g. 85 in our test case) required is difficult to predict a priori.
