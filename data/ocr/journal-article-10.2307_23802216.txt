<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REDEMPTIVE ROLE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE1 Modem society is marked by an increasing passion for study and research. The purpose of this essay is to clarify and deepen the significance of such a passion by exploring the meaning of a life of learning within the universe that Christianity has revealed to us. The Christian meaning of studies such as theology and philosphy and even the social sciences may seem more obvious than the pursuit of the natural or physical sciences; yet it is more properly with these that the essay deals. With appropriate nuances it may throw light upon the entire range of studies, but it directly faces the question : What is the properly Christian signifi cance of the attempt to understand the non-human world ? The attempt to understand nature includes that of the natural scientist and the tech nologist who, with experiments and constructs, attempt to understand and control natural forces; but it also includes that of poets who in symbols seek to understand and celebrate the natural things with which we live. Moreover, it is not the incidental inspirational ideas that may come to an individual while attempting to understand nature but the very structure of the attempt itself that is under inquiry. What is under discussion, then, is the import of the human search for an understanding of nature considered in the light of what Christ has revealed both nature and that human search to be. The reflections which follow suggest the meaning that the author thinks is to be found in the methaphysical theological tradition of Christian thought. I. A statement of the question: the apparent privacy of knowing Sometimes Christians and non-Christians seek to "justify" their intellectual pursuits by appealing to individual self-perfection or social utility. Or the Christian himself may appeal to their religious equivalents: 1 These reflections were first presented to students at Loyola University of Los Angeles and Marquette University, and appeared in a different form in Center (Summer, 1961. pp. 5—13), published by the Sisters of the Divine Saviour of Milwaukee. They were brought to final form during a fellowship received from the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. I wish to express my thanks to all for their interest and help. 223</page><page sequence="2">224 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ the salvation of his own soul or the furtherance of apostolic programs. If a fledgling Christian is asked, What is the meaning of life ? he may thumb through the first pages of his catechism to read, "the purpose of life is to know, love and serve God." Now as a Christian he knows that there are cups of water to be delivered and sick to be visited, heads to be held and hearts to be calmed in the love and service of God. What, however, is his mandate precisely as a student or a researcher ? It is to know,2 and even, through knowing, to know God; but what, then, is this knowing ? In what sense is it a service, and in what sense a loving ? To love and serve God is a thoroughly public affair, whereby the Christian becomes his brothers' keeper. In sharp contrast, knowing seems such a private affair. It occurs somehow within the interior of his life. It is not difficult to see how even private prayer is important to others. The hermit indeed is an intercessor, even for men unknown to him. His act of praying catches him up into the communion of saints and calls upon the immense power of the invisible church. His personal prayer, uttered in solitude, is an important social event. Even the non-Christian, while he may deny the reality of that event, sees that the argument follows from the premis ses of the Christian faith. Knowing, on the other hand, seems such a private affair. Your knowledge is yours and mine is mine. The act of understanding in which you grasp a difficult geometrical demonstration does not enlighten me. My ignorance may be removed only when a bridge is built between your understanding and mine. Every teacher and student knows with what cooperative care that bridge must be built in order that the privacy of the teacher's insight may be opened and the knowledge shared with the student. That is why teaching is difficult work. The problem then becomes this : if the life of study and research is a life of knowing, and if knowing is such a private affair, how can it have meaning for others? How can it have public significance? What is the role of knowing in the life of society ? To this question, Christians and non-Christians sometimes propose these answers. First, the intellectual can by vocation or avocation become a teacher, and in this way communicate his knowledge to others. What is unsatisfactory about this answer, however, is that teaching cannot be the ultimate reason for a life of study, for it is knowledge that teaching hopes to bring about. Teaching is a secondary, derivative, genetic 2 The mandate is universal but with especial import for those who devote their lives to learning.

An individual may study simply in order to teach others, but the structure of study does not have that as its principal aim. Teaching is a preparation for knowing and to give it primary place would be like hold ing banquets in order to set tables. Such an answer looks upon teaching as a public act but regards knowing as private. If knowledge has only private significance, however, the public character of teaching is engulfed in the private charcter of its result, like public waters poured down private wells. The public act of teaching will remain ordered to privacy. Second, it is sometimes proposed that through knowledge a moral reformation of personal character or a technical modification of our situation may be induced. Like teaching, this too may be a good reason for taking up a life of study and research, but it is not a reason which corresponds most closely to the structure of study and research. This second answer looks upon right action, both moral and technical, as public and practical, but implies that knowing is not, for it justifies knowing in terms of its practical fruits. It rests in a conception of the intellectual life according to which the public world is given over to action but knowing has not as such entered that world. It admits that knowing may result in something of public importance but does not consider that the very act of knowing is itself directly meaningful to others. I think that we can surpass these views and maintain against them the thesis that the intimate and personal activity of knowing is a public occasion, even without publication or teaching, and even without consid ering reformation and modification, although the fullest sense of knowing (of which we here speak) encourages these consequences, and is even inseparable from them. Drawing from the metaphysical-theological Christian tradition, it seems possible and even necessary to say, that the fullest activity of human understanding can be an event of cosmic importance which "penetrates" even into the interior life of the Trinity. Knowing is an act which shakes the ancient foundations of being. Even a creature's act of knowing does that. The created universe has never been the same since a creaturely intelligence has sought and in some measure begun to know it. And perhaps those death-like planets do but sleep . . . and wait . . . We should speak perhaps of the activity of understanding rather than of the act of understanding, for the latter word today may suggest isolated and momentary insights. We have in mind, rather, a prolonged and sustained endeavor. Moreover, in a sense to be clarified later, we are speaking here of knowledge in its fullest sense, that is, considered as 15 Franciscan Studies 1964</page><page sequence="4">226 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ opened to its fullest meaning, and demanding even certain dispositions of an affective nature. The question, then, becomes more preposterous as it becomes more precise : How can the life of study and research, as a pro longed activity of understanding in its fullest sense, be of deep, lasting and even universal importance for all creation ? The basis of our answer is the meaning of knowledge within the Christian universe. II. Intelligence in history Our consideration of the activity of understanding in its fullest sense is inseparable from a consideration of history, for the activity of human understanding is an historical event. Its immediate object is an historical situation, whether it be a laboratory experiment, a controlled interview, an intellectual analysis or a poetic symbolism. The being which man immediately knows and to which he is led through his knowledge is a being which is involved in historical movement. Moreover he himself as a knower is historically involved. We are not here asking : What must a proposition or event possess if it is to lay claim to inclusion within the study which we call history ? That question demands an examination of the distinctive subject-matter and methodologies proper to the disci pline of history. We are asking, rather, about the existential and ontolo gical character of that reality which is historical. What is the character, value and ontological status of that uncompleted and sketchily recorded totality of events whose immediate agents are human persons ? What is the being of this evanescent, unfinished whole ? What is its meaning ? Because man's being is fraught with and even constituted by the being of history, our question asks about the very meaning of human life itself. Man is an historico-metaphysical animal and has perennially sought an answer to this question. Within so called historical times several non-Christian accounts have been given. We are familar with an a-Christian answer which sweeps away the question itself. History, it says, is illusion, a vast shifting realm of maya; it has no being. We are familiar too with the pre-Christian account of our antiquity. History, it said, is not illusory, it has being; but its movement is cyclical and has no terminal. This gives history a minimal meaning, for it allows one to place himself or an event within a deter minate stage of the cycle and to derive its meaning in that way. Neverthe less, a cyclical history, tied to the subhuman rhythms of nature, does not lead anywhere, and an eternal recurrence robs each event of its unique importance. To most of us today such a history may claim to be real, but does not seem to be worthwhile. We are familiar too with a</page><page sequence="5">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 227 post-Christian account of history, originating in the Enlightenment but still influential today. According to it, historical process is real and going somewhere; it is a linear, not a cyclical, movement. Moreover, it is irreversible and moving toward an indwelling terminal. This account arose out of a society long familiar with the Christian insistence that history is a movement towards a goal; but it rejects the transcendent and yet immanent Christian goal in favor of a goal exclusively within this world. Its proponents are eighteenth century rationalists, Marxian and non Marxian socialists and twentieth century democratic and totalitarian secularists. To them history is a real and meaningful movement whose goal is immanent. There is also, of course, the contemporary analysis of historicity which one hears from existentialists but especially from the Dasein-analysis of Heidegger. The latter proposes an a-teleological conception of history, for it sees the teleological conception irretrievably bound up with a metaphysical understanding of being which must be overcome. There is undoubtedly much that is fruitful in such an analysis. It demands of us a new appreciation of the existential and ontological character of time; its very criticisms allow us to look with new under standing at the metaphysical tradition ; and it reminds us to distinguish carefully between revelation and the metaphysical-theological tradition which has interpreted it. Our present consideration draws from insights within that tradition, however, and a careful analysis would be required to show the differences and affinities of the Heideggerian conception with the metaphysical-theological tradition which has dominated Christian thinking about history. In that Christian conception of history as both immanent and transcendent, unlike even the latest views of Heidegger, man is open to the infinite and eternal. Christ gave a new and ultimate perspective to history, at once revealing and embodying its unique and universal value. The metaphysi cal-theological tradition has sought to understand that perspective by placing two questions concerning the meaning of history. The first asks about the modality of history, the second about its direction. The modality of history: intelligent motion. To ask about the modality of history is to ask about its being. The basal or minimal being of history is time, and time has two aspects, sequence and simultaneity. The ontological equivalent of sequence is movement; and of simultaneity presence. The famous Aristotelian definition of time determines it to be the measure of a motion whose roots are physical and even material. From this it follows that history, too, in its roots supposes incarnation. History belongs to a mode of being which does not have all that it is or</page><page sequence="6">228 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ may be, in contrast with eternity which is always what it is, can and will be. Nevertheless, although the basal being of history is a becoming, this becoming is a peculiar sort of movement which is found properly only in the ontological structure of man. History is the becoming of human intelligence : It belongs to man to advance in the knowledge of truth little by little . . . (and so for him) time seems to be a sort of helpmate and benificent co-worker. History is the development of incarnate intelligence in time, a develop ment which is not an insertion of spirit into matter but the subsumption of matter into spirit.3 To appreciate the aspect of simultaneous presence which also char acterizes history we must look beyond its basal being. There can be no history without intelligence. We speak of the natural history of plants and animals, but only because we comprehend the totality of their successive movements. For them there is no history, only movement. The very conception of history demands totality, for even if history is thought to be without beginning or end, it is comprehended after the manner of a whole. History demands comprehension, and this requires a power which can in some sense transcend the moving parts and embrace the movement as such and in its entirety. With such an activity of intel ligence the mere presence of time is transformed into the presence of history. In the growth of present trees the past is operative, but there is no history unless the past is understood as operating in the present. In contrast, present rapid technological advances are departures from a once stable way of life, and they are seen as improvements or degrada tions of the immediate past. The basal being of history is a becoming but its eminent being is intelligence. That intelligence is not the isolated Cartesian ego, nor is it the anti historical Reason of rationalism indifferent to tradition with its affecti vity, fidelity and love. The intelligence which is a proper, intrinsic principle constituting the being of history is a rational and fully human intelligence. It intuits step by step and according to a kind of time. It is a finite, discursive, spiritual openness. As theoretical intelligence it is discursive and intuitive. As practical it is ordered to affectivity, to inclination, decision and execution, for in intelligent motion there is the 3 Hegel saw this perhaps too clearly (see, for example, his lectures on The Philosophy of History, Introduction); what is questionable in his under taking is his conception of spirit. The quotation is from St. Thomas, Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nichomachum Expositio, Marietti, 1934, lib. I, lect. xi, nn. 132—134; it is based upon Aristotle, Ethica Nichotnachea, I, 7, 1098a 20—25.</page><page sequence="7">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 229 decisive will to move. History, then, in its modality is the temporal movement of human, that is, incarnate intelligence. The terminal of history: Eternal Being. Inscribed in any movement is a reference to its end and goal. Suppose that some migrating birds fly over. Are they flying to or from the nesting grounds ? You cannot discern the meaning of their movement until you know its terminus. Or suppose that a blurr flashes across the movie screen. You do not know the meaning of that movement until you determine whether there are smiling faces to left and right, or, on the contrary, a scowling face and a terrified victim. The meaning of a movement derives not simply from its motion but prin cipally from its term. The question about the modality of history, then, leads us to the question of its direction. What is the terminal of history ? Josef Pieper underlines how restricted a contribution the philosopher can make to the understanding of history. From his study of the being of God, the philosopher can assure us that God is not likely to permit the historical process to end in nothing. Nihilism is not the truth about history. The philosopher cannot, however, provide us with the experience, the datum or the subject-matter of the meaning of history. Jacques Maritain proposes certain functional and typological laws of history which, though they do not give us a knowledge of the last days of history, provide us with indications of certain tendencies projecting into the future and calling for our action. These laws are based on historical inductions, situated within the philosophical analysis of human nature and reality, and not unaffected by theological data "which are parti cularly illuminating and suggestive for the philosopher of history, because they provide him with a basic framework and basic indications about the direction of human history."4 Nevertheless, history has a depth which exceeds the grasp of philo sophical intelligence. In the life of an individual intelligence history is experience and its goal is happiness; in the life of nations it is tradition and their destinies ; and in the life of civilizations it is culture and their 1 Josef Pieper, The End of Time, c. 2, sec. 2, trans.

The light of theology which guards the transcendent freedom of God and the exalted freedom of man is a privileged, but not thereby the only light in this quest.</page><page sequence="8">230 KEN Ν Ε ΤΗ L. SCHMIΤΖ ideals. What is it in the life of the world? The human intelligence, im mersed in history and even constitutive of it, can grasp history only as an indeterminate whole, and so, if we are to understand history more adequately we must turn to the knowledge received from an intelligence which stands beyond history as its primal cause. We must turn to trans historical revelation.5 To early pagan peoples the word of God was a pronouncement about the meaning of history. The Venerable Bede has described a great council of 627 which King Edward of Northumbria had called in order to deter mine whether his people should accept the faith of Christ. After debate an elder spoke as follows : The present life of man upon earth, Ο king, seems to me, in comparison to that time which is unknown to us, like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the house wherein you sit at supper in winter, with your ealdormen and thegns, while the fire blazes in the midst, and the hall is warmed but the wintry storms of rain or snow are still raging abroad. The sparrow, flying in at one door and immediately out the other, whilst he is within, is safe from the wintry tempest ; but after a short space of fair weather, he immediate ly vanishes out of your sight, passing from winter into winter again. So this life of man appears for a little while, but of what is to follow or what went before we know nothing at all. If therefore, this new doctrine tells us something it seems justly to deserve to be followed.8 What does the new doctrine tell of this goal ? It proclaims that history is the journey of the people of God with God and to God, — that God of Whom it is said by St. Anselm in the eleventh century that He is eternal joy, and by Lacordaire in the nineteenth that He is eternal youth. History culminates, then, in an everlasting and joyful presence. It is in this sense, too, that Christian theologians have understood the formula (first uttered by Plato in a radically different sense): History is the moving image of eternity. History is the way towards the living God.7 Its agents are human wayfarers who are incarnate intelligences; the Divine Intelligence and eternal Being is the creative source, the providential guide and the final goal of the way. 6 It is not a present purpose to elaborate the profound difference between subhistorical myths and trans-historical revelation. For a discussion see Jean Daniélou, The Lord Of History, trans. N. Abercrombie, Chicago, Regnery 1958, pt. I, c. 8, esp. p. in. 8 Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England, II, xiii, a revised translation (of Giles and of Stevens) by A. M. Sellar, London, Bell and Sons, 1912, pp. 116—7. 7 We do not mean to deny or ignore evil in history; history in its sacral being and meaning is the overcoming of evil on the way to God. See the concluding remarks, below, VI.</page><page sequence="9">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 231 III. The Divine Intelligence in history We began by asking about the meaning of the attempt to under stand nature. Since the activity of the understanding is historical, we asked about the meaning of history. We have drawn from the metaphysi cal-theological tradition of Christianity the reply that it is the movement of incarnate intelligence towards the eternal being of God. We are here, however, at the most dangerous possibility of misunderstanding, a possibility which Christians have not always avoided. It would be false to imagine history as a linear movement unrolling in the direction of a distant God. That would have reduced time itself to a mere sequence, and have forgotten that time is also presence and that history is co-presence. We can, perhaps, best avoid this misunderstanding by placing the question: How can history move towards God? The final cause of any movement is the first of all the causes, and so there can be movement only if the final cause is somehow posessed, — in the passive potency of that which is moved, and in the active potency of that which moves itself towards its end. Pascal says that we could not move towards God unless we first possessed Him; and St. Thomas recognizes that no one would set out to prove the existence of God unless he first somehow knew Him to be.8 Following an ancient teaching, St. Bonaventure tells us that, to a mind illumined by faith and purified by prayer, the Blessed Trinity shines everywhere in the created universe. There is a trace or vestige of the Trinity in all created things, and rational creatures bear an even clearer reflection of the Trinity. Indeed, they are formed in the image of the Trinitarian God. This God is a moving force (objectum motivum) in the conscious life of men, that is, He is an objective Who solicits their understanding and love. It is well known that, for St. Bona venture, God is an eternal presence Who is somehow present in our knowledge as a confirming and stabilizing light. His teaching has been criticized as irrelavent to a philosophical explanation of natural human knowledge ; and it has been said that, in proclaiming the natural incapa city of creaturely knowledge to attain certitude, the doctrine of Divine Illumination does not honor the Creator. Nevertheless, among Christians, it gives witness to a presence of God in the conscious life of men. What is, at any rate, most essential here is the insistence that the Trinitarian 8 On the inchoative knowledge of God, Contra Gentiles, III, 38; also In Joannem Ev. Expositio, ed. Vivès, XIX, 669—671, and Exp. Super Symboles, ed. Mandonnet, Opuscula, IV. 351—3. On final causality, S. T. I—II, i, 2c; CG III, 17—21, 24—5.

(Knox Translation).</page><page sequence="10">232 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ God is possessed by the human intelligence in the manner in which a dynamic image possesses its authentic original.9 The individual human intelligence in history possesses God as objectum motivum; and more, — history itself is possessed by that Appeal for human understanding and love. History is movement towards God, a movement which would not be intelligent and which would not move at all unless God were present in it. God, indeed, has a home in history. History, which is the movement of incarnate human intelligence, is the moving image of His eternity. History, then, possesses God as an eternal creative presence. The great moments of sacred history, however, also teach us that He intervenes in the course of events. The pristine moment was that of the creation of man. God looked at His handiwork and judged it good. It was a fresh moment of innocent joy, and indeed was not so much a moment of history as it was its prelude. For our history is a movement of return to God, and it is difficult to conceive it in the absence of that original sin which was a calamitous yet divinely forgiven turning from God.10 In that age of innocence man sealed his God-given mastery of the subhuman world. The second and most dismal moment of history was that of the fall of man. We must not forget that with the master the world of subhuman things fell too. This was the moment of evil, sorrow and rejection of God by man. God, however, did not totally reject him, and so the third moment dawned, that of the covenant. God freely bound His hands with those of Abraham, and then of Isaac, Jacob and Moses. It was a somber moment of promise and hope. The fourth moment is that of the incarnation and redemptive suffering of Christ, wherein God became an infant and entered history in a most intimate way, even to death on a cross. It is our moment of faith, of deliverance from slavery, of freedom and decision, for in Christ God revealed to men that they might become His sons. It is seen that the "world-historical individual" is not the exalted pagan hero, nor the post-Christian revolutionary, but anyone who receives the adopted sonship of God. The final moment of history will be that of resurrection, judgment and communion, when all things are returned to the Father through Christ in union with the Holy Ghost. It will be the moment of consummation when history shall have been fulfilled. Reflecting upon this course of history, we may ask again : How does 9 Breviloquium, II, xii, ι—3, in Tria Opuscula, Ad Claras Aquas, 1925, PP· 93—"4: "Omnis intellectus, quantumcumque parum habens de lumine, notus est per cognitionem et amorem capere Deum."

Boas, The Mind's Road To God, New York, Liberal Arts Press, 1953. 10 In the Easter Liturgy the Roman Church itself exults: "O certe necessarium Adae Peccatum ... Ο felix culpa!" (Exsultet).</page><page sequence="11">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 233 the providential God dwell within His moving image? How does He work in history? God committed Himself to history by choosing the Jewish people, establishing them as a people and intervening for them. Christians have understood the divine covenant as having been taken up for the sake of Christ's redemptive mission.11 God works in history, then, through Christ its principal figure. St. Bonaventure tells us that we must return all things to the Father through Christ, because He Who is the creative principle is also the recreative principle. Christ is deeply, freely and generously involved in the return which is history. Through Him the Trinity works in history; through Him the Eternal One enters fully into history. For it is not until Christ's incarnation that God Himself becomes historical in His being. Of such a God strange things may be expected. In other religions men may go to God, but in Christianity God comes to man, even in time, even in matter. In and through Christ the eternal becomes historical. There is the ground in Christ for the co-existence of past and present in a remarkable way. Ordinarily the past may exist in the present in two ways. First, it may be present in the results which it presently produces, as the cause is present in its effects; this is the generative past. Second, it may be present in consciousness, in memory, experience and affectivity: this is the historical past. In this way the past is recollected and enters as a determinant of the present. In Christ's saving act, however, there is more. He has not only worked salvation through intermediary times and generations : the generative past. His very act is present and active here and now. Moreover, it is not merely present in commemoration: the historical past. To be sure, Christ is not a mythical culture-hero whose acts can be repeated in a "time outside of time."12 Christ died on a rise of ground in a city which today makes our headlines from time to time. His death was a thoroughly historical moment, and yet His act, andindeed all those acts which are done by or in Him, is here-and-now-in the present. Christ's act is truly historical, but it is more : it is an eternal act. His act is eternal in its value and being because it flows from His own 11 St. Paul, Hebrews, 8, 9, and 11; Moses esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the Egyptians, for he was looking to the reward" (11: 26). See also Justin Martyr, Dialogue with a Jew. For a comprehensive account of this practice in an early father, see Jean Daniélou, Origen, trans. W. Mitchell, New York, Sheed and Ward, 1955, pt. II, c. ii: "The Typological Interpretation of the Bible," especially p. 148. For the following reference to St. Bonaventure see below n. 25. 12 Such mythical escape from history is sought through imitation of a hero or god and by reenactment of an original archetypal event. See Mercea Eliade, Cosmos and History, The Myth of the Eternal Return, Harpers, New York, 1959, pp. 34—7·</page><page sequence="12">234 KEN Ν Ε ΤΗ L. SCHMIΤΖ Eternal Being. The ontological value of Christ's redeeming act is both historical and eternal because His being is both historical and eternal. The eternal of which we here write is, of course, not mere timelessness. It is the mode of being which is the creative source of time and into which time can be taken up. In the personal being of Christ it is taken up into His eternal life. Christ is the Son of Man, The Saviour who is immersed in history, through His own life, in His Eucharistie Presence in the Church and by incorporation with the members of His Mystical Body. He is also the Son of God, the Saviour of the totality of events, things, persons and deeds which comprises history. Christ is the Saviour in and of history: Christus viator et comprehensor simul.1S Every act associated with His life can be and is both historical and eternal. Such an association is the very opposite of a fusion of the historical and eternal, and instead it clarifies their distinct modalities while uniting them hypostatically in the personal life of Christ. Christ the historical-eternal person came to enlist men in their return to God. With Him God works in history through His creatures, — through physical things, human persons and their communities. In the Old Testament the first fruits and the first-born became sacrificial of ferings which acknowledged God's dominion and His people's devotion. Fire, cloud, stick and lions played their role. In the New Testament, the water of baptism, the bread, wine and oils stand forth for man and for all creation. In the Old Testament we learned how God worked through patriarchs, judges, priests, prophets and kings, and through His people and through their enemies; in the New Testament through apostles and disciples; and in the Church through saints and even through sinners. In the Old Covenant we learn how God works through the Jewish nation ; and in the New Dispensation through His Church. In truth, God works through all His creatures. In sharp contrast, if we humans were at the throttle of history, — surely sometimes we think it ! — we should run things differently. There would not be so much "waste" motion, so much "meaningless" passion. In fact, however, no man, not even Big Brother, runs history; God runs it. He is known by many names, but that which best suits Him as the providential guide of history is Patience. For He works through His creatures and seldom (if ever) does what the creatures can do. He could have saved all in any way He wished, but instead He began by choosing a people. It would be absurd to pretend to understand why He chose that particular people, but we can guess at why he chose 13 St. Bonaventure, Brev. IV, ix, 5, ed. cit., p. 156. On the being of eternity, see St. Thomas, S. T. I, 10, 4c and ad 3m.</page><page sequence="13">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 235 some particular people. He wished to enlist men and their communities and things in the task of their own salvation. This is the basic principle that gives meaning to the drama of the history of the world. We began by asking about the meaning of the attempt to understand nature. The question led us into a discussion of the meaning of history in which the attempt takes place. From the metaphysical-theological tradition in Christianity we have determined history to be the movement of incarnate intelligence in the presence of the eternal being of God, yet moving towards His fuller presence. Although we may in some context wish to distinguish the creative Intelligence of the way from the creative Intelligence of the term, we must remember that it is the one and same divine Intelligence, that Eternal Being Who in creating the way which is history is precisely its term. It would be a crass misunderstanding, too, to suppose that God as present mover is immanent and as distant term is transcendent. It is the same Eternal Being Who as the term of history is at once immanently present and transcendentally present. It is a fatal error to identify immanence with presence and transcendence with a kind of absence. Just such an error lay at the base of nineteenth century criti cisms of Christianity, such as Nietzsche's, who charged that Christianity urged denial of this life for the sake of life beyond the grave. To him that was the highest nihilism: to give up an uncertain something for a certain Nothing.14 A Christendom which had forgotten that the new life with God begins here and now in this life would deserve to be parodied as "Plato nism for the people." But the metaphysical-theological tradition, on the contrary, manifests the living God as an Eternal Presence, Who by His indivisible presence is both immanent and transcendent. His way of being manifests His creative transcendence as the source of His intimate imma nence and His creative immanence as the mark of His absolute trans cendence. We have said, too, that time manifests itself as sequence and simul taneity, and that history is revealed as culminating in eternity. Christ in His person and church unites sequence and simultaneity, that is, past and present with His eternity. Thereby He enlists the beings of history in His redemptive work. IV. The human intelligence in history Our original question about the attempt to understand nature is now ready to undergo yet another transformation. In a universe in which 14 In Beyond Good and Evil, I, 10, said of the metaphysicians (Werke in drei Bànden, ed. K. Schlechta, Hanser, Muenchen, II, 574).</page><page sequence="14">236 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ all creatures are called upon to share in the task of their common sal vation, what is the meaning of this activity of understanding ? In such a universe what does it mean to study or research or symbolise ? What does it mean above all to seek an understanding of nature? The first step in answering the question calls for a reflection on the ontological structure and tendency of the human intelligence. In the metaphysical theological tradition it is manifested as (1) trans-subjective, (2) trans temporal and (3), in the visible creation, the unique creaturely access to the spiritual world of Eternal Being. The human understanding is trans-subjective in its awareness. The activity of understanding manifests itself as an ontological openness. It "carries" a man beyond his own circumference to the being of others, for knowing is always a knowing-of . . . something. A knowing without a reference to something would refer to nothing. A knowing which did not signify something other than its knowing would be without significance. In technical terms, knowing is described as intentional, referential, even as "objective"; the knowerissaid to be the other as other.16 Its referential character anticipates the public nature of knowing. It does not put the world in a man's head, but rather places him before the world, or rather in the world. Knowing is representation because it makes a man present in the world and to things in the world. If some physical thing were, by fanciful supposition, suddenly given the gift of knowing, that gift would not place the world within it, but would rather make it present in the world in a new and strange manner. It would retain all its former rela tionships with the world and the things in the world; it would continue to be related spatially, chemically and physically; but now it would relate itself in a new and distinct way, for it would confront the things in the world. Knowing is confronting. To know is to place oneself before some thing and within a world. And so getting to know is radically different from getting fat, for fat qualifies its subject and resides within the increas ing circumference of its being, whereas knowing "carries" a man beyond 15 See J. Maritain, Degrees of Knowledge, trans, from fourth French edition, supervised by G. B. Phelan, Scribner's, New York, 1959, pp. 128— 132. The term "objective" may be misleading. The existentialists are correct in criticizing any attempt to rest the ultimate ontological character of human knowledge on objectivity, since the word strictly taken either excludes the subjectivity of knowing or reduces knowing to a question of validity. The term is here used with quotation marks to distinguish it from its use as a criterion of validity or certitude (as on p. 28 below). Here it is a synomyn for the descriptive attitude of the human intelligence. The ability to "objectify", that is, to describe, is rooted in an ontological openness which is trans subjective and trans-objective.</page><page sequence="15">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 237 his circumference so that he might be present to and with the being of others. Knowing is being trans-subjective. The study of so called animal languages shows that, excepting man, no animal gives evidence of a capacity for trans-subjective representation. The often subtle and complex communications between animals reflect the immersion of the subjects in the here-and-now situation as it affects them.18 Even so-called instinctual behaviour, whose ends are often remote, is triggered by considerations acting upon the subject here-and now. Of course, much human language and behaviour reflects the in volvement of the human subject. Sentences beginning with phrases as, "I hope that . . "I like . ..," and so on, may be determined by the relationship of the subject to the situation here-and-now, but what is decisive is the manner in which the human subject relates itself to that relationship. What is present over and above the relationship of the subject to the here-and-now situation, and what is present in human language and apparently wholly absent in so-called animal languages is the descriptive attitude which expresses itself in declarative sentences, such as, "This paper is white." Such an expression reveals an attitude which intends to be trans-subjective; its speaker is other-centered in interest and not merely subject-centered. Such human knowledge is, by intention at least, trans-subjective, and even subjective wish-demand expressions are shot through with trans-subjective meaning-elements. Thus, in the sentence, "I like ice cream," or even, "I would like some ice cream," the meaning of "ice cream" may be "that which pleases me here and-now," but that which is an object and is so understood. Ask the speaker what ice cream is, and he will launch into a description of it as something in-the-world. The human understanding is trans-temporal in its being. To fail to see knowing as radically different from other acquisitions which determine the condition of the subject is to fail to see the peculiar ontological character of knowledge and the unique way it can fulfill the open being of the human person. The trans-subjective direction of knowing is rooted in its supra-temporal character, a supremacy which does not indicate a flight from time but, on the contrary, a taking up of time into a more than-temporal mode of being. "Beasts live in the present, they know only the here and the now, but Man — and that constitutes his peculiar 18 Cf. G. Révész, The Origins and Prehistory of Language, trans. J.

And not only of days, weeks and years, but of the ever recurring, of the ever present, problem of birth and death."17 To have seized upon the beginning and end of one's own being is, at the least, to have sensed the possibility of the beginning and the end of all being that comes to be. It is because the animal does not seem able to perceive anything except as bound with him in the spatio-temporal confines of the present situation that he is not able to disengage himself sufficiently in order to respond to and attempt to describe the situation as it is and not merely as it envelopes his organ ism. Even animal memory manifests itself as intra-temporal. On the contrary, human language can express even the subjective organic affections of the speaker in a descriptive manner. We ought, however, to avoid reducing that descriptive response to an automatic reaction. The trans-subjective achievement of human understanding is a possi bility and as such, a task to be undertaken again and again. It is the effort to open oneself in order to be with the other as he is in his being. If the animal cannot describe things as they are, it would seem to have no means or needs for modes of awareness which are trans-historical. Human language, on the other hand, is filled with terms which designate things and activities, but without immediate reference to this or that thing or activity. Thus for example, beauty, humanity, animal, refer to things which exist in time and place, but the mode of representation and reference is free from engagement in any particular temporal-spatial situation. The terms are universal. Paradoxically they manifest an abstract poverty, but also declare that man in his intelligence is existen tially free of physical determinations and faces the physical world from a transcendant trans-temporal and trans-spatial niveau. For their being there is no need to appeal to Platonic common es sences, but simply to recognize certain similarities of function which the understanding observes in existentially diverse individuals. Anne writes poetry, Geoff writes mathematics, Donald types, Jonathan writes with ink. Each of these activities is diverse and different. Nevertheless the intelligence can see a similarity of function in each: each is the use of shapes to convey meaning, and we call this function, writing. The uni versal mode of knowing "carries" a man beyond the circumference of his own being and refers him to others by disengaging aspects of their nature and circumstances and representing them as meanings which transcend the spatio-temporal restrictions and pressures of the immediate situation.

Brodrick, New York, Random House, 1955, Ρ· ίχ·</page><page sequence="17">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 239 To be sure, human knowing is the activity of an incarnate spirit, and so its fulfillment demands reference to things as they are in place and time. What is needed, however, before there can be any reference to things in time and place is to recognise the elements which are condition ally necessary throughout the duration of the things' existence in time and place. Thus, for example, hook is a complex notion whose meaning structure is without immediate reference to this or that book and demands a posture of the human intelligence which transcends all actual or possible individual books. That meaning-structure includes such similar ities as "man-made," "for reading," "physical depository of intelligible signs," and so on. The human intelligence is perfected, to use this ex ample, only by associating with books, these here, those over there ; but it cannot associate with books at all unless it reads in these diverse individuals an intelligibility which transcends the mere temporal spatial limitations of this or any other actual or possible situation. More must, however, be said. Remarkable as is the human ability to represent meaning-elements in a universal fashion, it is an error to conclude that this ability is identical with the even more remarkable so called "objectivity" of human knowledge, namely, the ability to recognise a situation or thing as it is and not merely as it affects the knower. The so called "objectivity" is the peculiarly human achievement of being present to the other precisely or at least in some degree as he or it is, that is, as other. The ability to disengage universal meaning-elements from the other is the necessary prelude and condition to such a recognition, but does not constitute it. Recognition of the other as other arises through the judgment that this is so and so. In this sense the termination of knowledge in a judgment of the other is not a mere return to the senses but a completion of a free and spiritual activity of the understanding, whereby it frees itself from enclosure in its own being. At this niveau of "objecti vity" the sensible and the intellectual conditions of knowing are taken up into a trans-subjective, trans-temporal and trans-spatial openness. The human understanding gives access to the world of Eternal Being. The trans-subjective intentionality of human understanding demands the trans-historical character of knowing which in turn demands the spiritual being of such a knower. Because in his intelligence man exists as an openness beyond time and process, he can be given the grace to perceive the trans-subjective and trans-historical truth of religious revelation. Without this, religion would remain, if at all, at the level of subjective conviction and changing feelings. To be sure, it is necessary that conviction fortify true dogma and that emotion strengthen true</page><page sequence="18">240 KEN NE ΤΗ L. SCHMITZ judgments, but conviction without truth and emotion without reality are a shifting and uncertain morass. Experience teaches us the central role of trans-subjective truth in our lives. Without it we remain closed in on ourselves, and the reality of other persons and things is obscured. Writing of the belief in the brotherhood of man Chesterton remarks : I have therefore found in my middle age this curious fact about the lesson of my life, and that of all my generation. We all grew up with a common conviction, lit by the flames of the literary genius of Rousseau, of Shelley, of Victor Hugo, finding its final flareup and conflagration in the universal ism of Walt Whitman. And we all took it for granted that all our descendants would take it for granted. I said the discovery of brotherhood seemed like the discovery of broad daylight; of something that man could never grow tired of. Yet even in my own short lifetime, men have already grown tired of it. We cannot now appeal to the love of equality as an emotion. We cannot now open a new book of poems, and expect it to be about the life-long love of comrades, or "Love, the beloved Republic, that feeds upon freedom and lives." We realize that in most men it has died, because it was a mood and not a doctrine. And we begin to wonder too late, in the wise fashion of the aged, how we could ever have expected it to last as a mood, if it was not strong enough to last as a doctrine. And we also begin to realise that all the real strength that remains in it, was the original strength of the doctrine.18 It is the natural spiritual openness of the human intelligence to which the revealing God appeals as to the sesame through which His healing truth may penetrate the human being and open his life out to the world of Eternal Being. This is the meaning of religious dogma which is so often parodied as blind stubbornness. It is difficult today to retrieve the trans subjective openness of religious dogma, and it is no accident that the same cultural revolution of the seventeenth century (under whose influence we still live) saw both the rise of non-dogmatic religions of affective piety and inspiration and also the rise of subjective philosophi cal theories of knowledge. The relation between the trans-subjective openness of knowing and the ontological order of religious truth and good should dispel the attempt to found religion upon subjective feeling. All attempts, for example, to place the efficacy of the sacrament upon the good or evil character of the minister ministering it have failed to grasp the trans human status of religious truth and good. Eleventh century proponents of the Gregorian reform saw this when they reaffirmed the validity of function even in an evil priest. There is an efficacious religious order and through knowledge man may be given access to it. 18 The Thing, Why I am A Catholic, New York, Dodd Mead and Co., 1930, p. 19·</page><page sequence="19">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 241 The trans-subjective openess of human knowing is the human basis for the ontological order of graces which are present in and through the sacraments. The latter are understood as visible physical presences and signs of the invisible presence of spiritual graces. They mirror man's twofold nature, for they are unions of two realms of being, of body and spirit. They are apt remedies for beings who are both temporal and trans temporal, physical and trans-physical, and they are rooted in the spiritual reality of God's living care for His creation. The ontological order of graces teems with the living presence of the divine Persons and wholly originates from Them. The trans-subjective and trans-temporal character of the sacraments, however, finds its natural complement in the trans subjective capacity of human knowing. The spiritual character of the human knower is the needle's eye through which eternal light-borne religious goods enter the human and subhuman world. For this reason the intellectual act is a most worthy activity, an exceptionally powerful and promising favor given to creation. It is within this favor that we find the meaning of the activity of understanding in its fullest sense, and within that we find the meaning of the attempt to understand nature. V. The fourfold dignity of the activity of human understanding The activy of human understanding considered in its fullest sense is the activity of an intelligent being whose openness of knowledge presup poses an openness of love. For that reason it is an activity which can be exercized by all men. Our question, however, asked about the meaning of an intense and enduring intellectual attempt to study, research or symbolize nature. We are, perhaps, better prepared after our discursus through the character of history and knowing to answer the question with more depth. For the light of the metaphysical-theological tradition in Christianity manifests to us a universe in which the intellectual act has a privileged role. The activity of understanding is an intellectual act which is (1) primary, even primordial and original, (2) most appro priate, (3) which enhances the things that it knows, and (4) which, in the Christian economy, can even redeem them. The activity of understanding is primary, primordial, orginal. The human act of understanding is an inner mental word made manifest in the spoken and written word. The inner word bears a likeness to the divine Word, which is the originating principle through Whom all things are made, and so the human understanding in its activity resembles the creative act. In that resemblance it finds its own power as the most primary and original act in the order of creaturely acts. 16 Franciscan Studies 1964</page><page sequence="20">242 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ (a) What does it mean to say that the human understanding bears a likeness to the divine Word ? Following a tradition which is elaborated in even greater fullness by St. Bonaventure, St. Thomas describes the image relationship as a causal relation in which the image comes from, resembles and participates in its original. In the following text he distin guishes the way in which the resemblance of the rational creature differs from that of the sub-rational. Every effect in some degree represents its cause, but diversely. For some effects represent only the causality of the cause, but not its form; as smoke represents fire. Such a representation is called a trace (vestigium) ; for a trace shows that someone has passed by but not who it is. Other effects represent the cause in terms of a likeness to its form, as fire generated represents fire generating, and as a statue of Mercury represents Mercury; and this is called the representation of image. Now the processions of the divine Persons are referred to the acts of the intellect and will, as was said above. For the Son proceeds as the Word of the intellect; and the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love of the will. Therefore, in rational creatures which possess intellect and will, there is found the representation of the Trinity by intellect and the love proceeding in the will.18 The essential attributes by which men come to be in the image of God, then, lie in their capacity for knowledge and love. In another passage St. Thomas cites St. John Damascene and remarks that man is made to the image of God because he is intellectual and free and has dominion over his own acts. Man has an absolute dependence on God in and for his very being, yet the marks of that resemblance and dependence anticipate his own human work: the effort to understand, the marshalling of his own freedom, and responsible dominion over his own acts and his rela tions with others. This is the dynamic and historical image which man both is and in a fuller sense can be. Looking forward to the fulfillment of that opportunity, St. Thomas sets forth three ways in which man can be to the image of God : with the resemblance of nature, grace and glory. The image of God can be considered in man in three ways. First, inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for understanding and loving God ; and this aptitude consists in the very nature of the mind, which is common to all men. Second, inasmuch as man actually or habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly; and this image consists in the conformity of grace. Thirdly, inasmuch as man knows God actually and loves Him perfectly; and this image consists in the likeness of glory. Therefore, on the words, The light of Thy countenance, 0 Lord, is signed upon us (Ps. iv, 7) the Gloss distin 5. T. I, 45, η. The next citation is from S. T. I—II, prol.</page><page sequence="21">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 243 guishes a threefold image, of creation, of re-creation and of likeness. The first is found in all men, the second only in the just, the third only in the blessed.30 At the creaturely level, the image is the primordial creative gift which the rational creature receives in receiving his natural intellectual being. At the wayfaring level, that is, within history, the image as a journey, is a supernatural gift of God, though still an imperfect likeness of Him. And at the apex, the image as repatriation is a supernatural gift of God and a perfect likeness. Nevertheless, it is still a likeness, and so "our word is never to be equalled to the divine Word, not even when we shall be like God."21 For that reason we can never properly say of the human intelligence and its language that it is creative. Yet we may ask in what sense human thought and language resemble the creative power of the divine Word. The prevailing conceptions of language do not make it easy to anwer the question. Much importance is attached today to reaching the linguistic ideal of precision and clarity. This is a necessary corrective to lazy and irrational abuses of language. The descriptive formulas of modern, and especially of the natural, sciences seem to all but reach perfection in this endeavor. Such an ideal when taken as absolute, however, leads to an in adequate conception of the full power of language, in which language is understood simply as a function and limited to the narrow role of merely restating data. It is a commonplace that we have lost much of man's previous reverence for the spoken and written word. It is too easy to accept uncritically the Comtean-like view that the sacral, theological and ontological conception of language has been outmoded by a newer secular and scientific conception which is primarily psychological and epistemological.22 The reverence for the word is to be found in the meta physical-theological tradition in the form of a certain sapiential concep tion of language, though since the seventeenth century it has been increasingly deemphasized. An appreciation of language deeply rooted in wisdom remembers the transforming power of even the human word. The wise man is the man of exceptional understanding and effective counsel. He brings to birth true thought, right sentiment and efficacious 20 5. T. I, 93, 4C. 21 St. Augustine, De Trinitate, XV, xvi, trans. W. J.

He brings harmony into human affairs; and feeling and deed come to be transformed through the power of his word. Language in the service of the ideal of wisdom demands appropriate precison and clarity but also reveals even the descriptive formulas of modern science as a new birth in being. It knows, too, that human discourse shapes a new world of intercourse between men and things. Such a language resembles and participates in the truly creative power of the divine Word. That divine Word has a privileged role in the formation of things. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God, He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him and without Him was made nothing that was made."23 The origin of created things lies in the continuing utterance of the Word, and the Fathers therefore liken the created universe to a book. The Psalmist, prefiguring the revelation of the divine Word, proclaims : Praise ye the Lord . . . Praise ye Him, Ο sun and moon : praise him, all ye stars and light. Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, and let all the waters that are above the heavens praise the name of the Lord. For He spoke, and they were made : he commanded, and they were created . . . Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which fulfill His word: mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars: beasts and all cattle: serpents and feathered fowls: kings of the earth and all people : princes and all judges of the earth. Christians have understood this as applicable to the relation of things to Christ, and in the minor elevation during mass have offered all things to the Father through Christ in union with the Holy Ghost.24 St. Bona venture writes that it is most fitting that man return to the Father through the God-man Christ, but also because the Word is that through Whom all things first come to be.26 St. Paul remarks: 23 John I, ι—5. The next quotation is from Psalm 148, Cf. Apoc. 5: 13. 24 Christ Himself says: "I am the way and the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me." (John 14: 5—6.) See also John 6: 48—-59; 10: ι—18; Cf. Apoc 22: 13—17. 25 See the following texts from St. Bonaventure: De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam, 12, ed. cit., p. 376—7: "Per hunc intellige, quod a summo Opifice nulla creatura processit nisi per Verbum aeternum, in quo omnia disposuit, et per quod perduxit non solum creaturas habentes rationem vestigii, sed etiam imaginis, ut eidem assimiliari possint per cognitionem et amorem. Et quoniam per peccatum rationalis creatura oculum contempla tionis obnubilatum habuit; decentissimum fuit, ut aeternas et invisibile fieret visibile et assumeret carnem, ut nos ad Patrem reduceret. Et hoc est quod dicitur Ioannis decimo quarto: Nemo venit ad Patrem nisi per me; et Matthaei undecimo: Patrem nemo novit nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare. Et ideo dicitur Verbum caro factum. Considérantes igitur illimitati onem artis mechanicae quantum ad operis agressus, intuebimur ibi Verbum generatum et incarnatum, id est Divintatem et humanitatem et totius fidei integritatem." Also idem, 23, ed. cit. p. 383 : "Necesse est etiam ponere medium</page><page sequence="23">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 245 In the Son of God, in his blood, we find the redemption that sets us free from our sins. He is the true likeness of the God we cannot see ; His is that first birth which precedes every act of creation. Yes, in him all created things took their being, heavenly and earthly . . . They were all created through Him and in Him ; He takes precedency of all, and in Him all subsist... It was God's good pleasure to let all completeness dwell in Him, and through Him to win back all things, whether on earth or in heaven, into union with Himself, making peace with them through His blood, shed on the cross. St. Augustine asks : How, Ο God, didst Thou make heaven and earth ?... Thou speakest, and they were made, and in Thy Word Thou makest them . . . and whatever Thou sayest shall be made is made ... In this Beginning, Ο God, hast Thou made heaven and earth, in Thy Word, in Thy Son, in Thy power, in Thy Wisdom, in Thy Truth; wonderously speaking, and wonderously making.28 The dignity of the human understanding consists in its imaging the divine Word which is both the creative and recreative principle of the world. In the imaging of this two-fold role of the divine Word, creator et redemptor, the human understanding has an opportunity to play a major role in the recreative redemption of the world. The beginning of that work and its fulfillment lie in the intimate openness of the human intelligence and its word. It is, says St. Augustine, a dual word, for when we understand we express an interior silent word, and when we speak we utter an exterior audible word. He remarks that "the word that sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly; which latter has the greater claim to be called a word," for it is the work of a word to give light. So too the inner word expresses itself in the bodily sound, just as the divine Word assumed bodily flesh; and so too, just as all things are made through the divine Word, so all human acts proceed through the inner human word. The language of inner and outer, of sign and meaning may appear to us to be too dualistic, may in egressu et regressu rerum; sed medium in egressu necesse est, quod plus teneat se a parte producentis, medium vero in regressu, plus a parte redeuntis ; sicut Mediatorem Dei et hominum non tantum Deum esse, sed etiam hominem, ut homines reducat ad Deum."

It may indeed be true that today we understand more deeply the incarnate and historical character of human speech and that the human word is ontologically one. On the other hand, at least part of our dissatisfaction with St. Augustine's account may lie with ourselves who, having undergone the historical experience of Cartesian dualism, may have lost the immediate sense in which the outer dynami cally signifies the inner by partaking of its light and life and thereby forming with it one complex word. That human word is the analogue of the creative Word. The intellectual act which bears as its fruit the interior word of understanding, and with it the entire complex human word, is privileged because it is the powerful likeness of that primary, primordial and original act through which all is made. (b) The realization of that likeness is not static, but rather a gift to be received and a task to be undertaken. The gift is a growing likeness of one's understanding and being to the divine ; the task is one of partici pating in the formation of one's being and understanding, the task of self-formation. An image relationship can, of course, be understood in a variety of ways. One of the crudest relations is that of the wax plate to the seal or the printed paper to the press. Much more mysterious is the relation of an artistic work to its artist who is inspired and guided by his artistic objective. An even more profound and mysterious embodiment of the image relation is the kinship of father and son. Most men hope that their sons come to be, at least in some ways, in their image and likeness. In procreation certain biological affinities are brought about; but true fathers hope for more, and in their families they work consciously towards an enculturation of ideals, attitudes and skills. A father and mother generate a child in their biological image, and if they are truly parents, go on to give him example, to train and teach him, and to offer him an inheritance and a heritage. In this activity father and mother should be principal causes who cooperate within the family and with the community through friends and teachers. The child thereby comes to participate in a complex exemplar : he is in the image of his father and mother, of his family and community and of individuals and societies which transcend his community. It is the task of parenthood to lead him into this complex ideal. To be a fully human parent to one's child is a conscious and delib erate work. Such fully human deeds require a loving understanding, that is to say, an openness to the child in his being. It is a difficult ideal, perhaps, to set before a parent, but it should be taken up by the under standing, in uncertainty and hope, with its anguish but also its satis</page><page sequence="25">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 247 factions. St. Augustine remarks that "there are no works of man that are not first spoken in his heart : whence it is written, A word, is the beginning of every work. (Ecclus. xxxvii, 20)."27 Gabriel Marcel reminds us that each fatherly act is the incarnation of a father's love and understanding, and a proclamation to "behold my son!" In the begetting and rearing of his son a true father is an effective cause who offers to his son an opportunity, that is, an exemplar which can be a formal and final cause, and which is offered in a spirit that respects the intelligence, freedom and autonomy of his son. On the side of the son, over and above the hereditary affinities such as psychological dispositions, the exemplar can be assimilated as forma tive of his very being. For he can become like his father in modes of action, such as zeal or placidity, gusto or deliberation, and in qualities, such as generousness, courage, honesty and openness. As a final cause the exemplar offers itself as that in which the son participates as in a goal to be achieved, such as to seek excellence in what is worthy and to further what is best in himself within the ideals of family, community and human ity. We are here far from the mechanical relation of seal to wax, and can see that the image relation of son to father is a rich texture of human as sociations and ideals. It not only respects the unique freedom of the son but manifests that becoming a true son demands a work which is most intimate, personal and non-repetible, and which calls for all the resources of a truly human freedom. The son is not the image of the father as wax is the repetitive and inert image of the seal, and the father or son who attempts to bring about such an imitation will surely fail. Rather the son is the image of the father as the incarnation of everything that is best and highest in him. The image relationship, so understood, does not demand slavish imitation; nor does it include the mimicry of vices but only their overcoming. The image relationship reaches its peak in the resemblance man bears to God. Marcel writes that human fatherhood is only partly organic and finds its highest exemplar in the fatherhood of God. We are often told that a child takes his early conception of God from his relation to his own human father. It remains to add that the chief work of maturity and the sign of the authenticity of a religious experience can be manifest 27 De Trin. XV, xi; éd. cit. II, 847—8.

SCHMITZ when a son begins to understand his father as the image of the divine Father. In that moment he also sees himself as an image of the divine Son. The realities of fatherhood and sonship, divine and human, are especially difficult for us to grasp today. We have undergone the cultural experience of an anti-historical rationalism and individualism which also denied and thereby degraded the meaning of childhood. Decartes, for example, all but complains that it would have been better to have been born a fully mature adult. That, of course, would have been to by pass the first efforts of coming-to-be in the likeness of one's father. In this lies at least a great part of the meaning of that immature dependence which is one's childhood, Nevertheless, important as childhood is, we should not, under the influence of a prevalent ideal of independence in which a "mature individual" feels that in the deepest sense he owes no thing to anyone, not even to his father, — under that influence we should not reduce the meaning of sonship to the passing status of childhood. It would be an error, of course, to deny that such a dependence is included in the very meaning of sonship : as the child is dependent on his father, so much the more are we as children of the heavenly Father dependent upon Him. Nevertheless the full meaning of sonship must be disengaged from an equation with the immaturity of childhood. For sonship means coming-to-be-like-and-with-the-father. For this work of maturation the son must receive from his father as from an efficient, final, formal and exemplary cause; but that reception calls for the highest human effort and upon his full autonomy. The effort, enspirited by grace, begins and is achieved in the open and loving awareness of the human understanding. In its responsive and creative role the human understanding in father and son bears a likeness to the divine creative Word through Whom all things are made in the likeness of the Father. In opening ourselves out to what is best in family and community we form our being and with the help of grace become more like the divine Word and the divine Father. In this same growth we open ourselves out to the world of things and are enabled to play there a role in their redemp tion. To see how this is possible we now turn to the other marks of the dignity of human understanding considered in its fullest sense. The activity of understanding is the most appropriate act. In the crea turely order only the spiritual openness of intelligence can assimilate all being to itself. Thus Aristotle declares that the soul is in a manner all things, both "by virtue of becoming all things " and "by virtue of making all things." The human intelligence is an openness ordered to being, for that which it knows is always being in one of its modes, and</page><page sequence="27">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 249 through these modes it is open to being without qualification.28 Since it can assimilate or appropriate all being to itself, the intellectual act is the most appropriate of all acts. Such an assimilation or appropriation, however, is easily misunder stood and even thwarted or perverted. To assimilate is to become like. There is that assimilation which is accomplished through the dissolution of one being by and in another, as when a wolf assimilates sheep. Thereby one term of the relation increases itself in its own flesh. We have seen, however, that assimilation in knowing means that the knower is "carried outward" and terminates in conforming, that is, in "being made over in the likeness of," or more truly, in being present to the thing known as it is in its being. So too when we think of appropriation within the category of power we think of a being bringing more being into or under itself, as when a government appropriates land or a slave owner binds to himself slaves. Thereby one term of the relation increases itself in property and power. It is possible and even frequent for a person to misuse his under standing in order to bind all things known by it to himself, as a tyrant encloses subjects within his own self-interest. Such a misappropriation is bound to fail, however, and violates the ontological structure of the understanding. The relation of the intelligence to the thing known is originated and sustained by the intelligence itself and it makes the thing to be in some sense appropriated by that intelligence. Nevertheless it is a trans-subjective appropriation and leaves the proper being of the known untouched. By such a trans-subjective appropriation the intel ligence makes the being of the known to be its (that is, the intelligence's) being, but that appropriation is constituted by the intelligence opening itself to the thing known and making the being of the known a matter of interest and concern to the being of the knower. Making the being of the known a matter of concern (understanding in its fullest sense) means standing open to the being of the known and respecting it in its being. Only in this way is the truth of the thing revealed. This should not condemn the human intelligence to a passive and inert resignation in the face of things. Study, research and the poetic expression of nature require experience and this comes through inter course between man and the world of things. In that intercourse man must often be active, even aggressive. In research, above all, he must 28 On the soul, Aristotle, De Anima, III, 8, 431b 20—28; 5; 430a 14—17.

SCHMITZ control the conditions of observation and actively embark upon theoreti cal as well as practical constuctions. Moreover, modern science and technology are becoming more and more intimately interdependent, so that one can scarcely speak of technology as the mere application of theoretical knowledge already gained. Even philosophical contemplation demands intercourse between men and things. It is only that this inter course and the human power to transform things ought to be placed within a basic respect for the integrity of things. The particular form of that respect will vary from situation to situation and no over-all formula can be laid down in advance. The difficulty is especially acute in our world of rapid technological change because, while the respect should derive from an intellectual insight into the ontological structure of things, it is precisely such an understanding which is difficult to achieve in a world that is being transformed more and more through human power. Nevertheless the need to respect things is neither a medieval hang-over from a supposedly static world of substances nor a merely sentimental feeling. It is demanded as much by human knowledge as it is by things themselves. It is the basic condition for trans-subjective truth, and within that, for scientific objectivity. Considered in its fullest ontological sense the human understanding is an open concern for the being of things and for its own being, for it is the awareness that man and things share a mutual destiny. Because of the nature of this trans-subjective appropriation, man is ordained to be master of subhuman creation. Revelation teaches us that, in the original order of things, Adam was their master. For God said: Let us make man to our image and likeness : and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. In the garden of paradise he walked and saw the creation with which the Lord had endowed him. The Lord brought each animal before him, and as Adam saw it he named it. The first man thereby sealed his mastery over the animals by calling them by name.29 They were not only known 29 Genesis I: 26; cf. St. Thomas, S. T. I, 96, 1 and 2. An old tradition holds that Adam gave each animal the proper name which revealed its true and essential character and that we have lost this knowledge through the sin. Moses seems to be speaking of the Hebraic names in use in his day: "And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them ; for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is his name. And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the fields." (Genesis 2: 19—20; 1: 27—9.) The chief point is clear: Adam's naming fixed the order between himself as master and his creation as subject. Cf. St. Thomas, S. T. I, 94, 3 sed contra.</page><page sequence="29">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 251 to him but came to be known by him. There was great power in Adam's exterior word because it was the sign of his interior word; and that first naming under God was sufficient to fix man's mastery under God. The tradition attaches great import to the act of naming. So too, Christians have always known that the greatest misfortune that can befall a man is that the Lord not recognize him, that he be not called and that his name be blotted from the Book of Life.30 The power of naming reflects the power of knowing, and this knowing penetrates into the very being of another. The language of common law preserves an ancient testimony to the penetrating power of knowing, for it describes the most intimate physical union as a carnal knowing; and carnal knowledge is that union which classical authors describe as transforming a youth into a man and a maid into a woman. Man lost his original masterful knowledge, and yet there are pale reflections of it. The persistent primitive belief in magic is, in part, an inefficacious and amoral conviction of the transforming power of the word. A more forceful example is modern technology, whereby man masters things by his intelligence, unifies vast data by compact symbols and thereby transforms the physical world.31 Too often today, perhaps, man in his fallen state corrupts his mastery over the subhuman world until it becomes an unintelligent domination. Too often he forgets that man and things have a mutual destiny and that their common destiny is sealed in and by his knowing them. Knowledge with its attendant culture is a remedy for man's indigence and also for a certain indigence in things. That mutual indigence, however, can be remedied only in an activity of appropriation whereby man becomes the master of things by mutually respecting himself and things, their natures and laws. As the father re spects the son in his being, so too this appropriation respects the dignity of natural things and is farthest removed from appropriation as a sheer 30 Exodus 32: 32—3: "He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book." Psalm 68: 29: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written." St. Paul, Philippians 4: 3 ; "They have toiled with me in the gospel, as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life." Luke 10: 20: "Rejoice rather in this, that your names are written in heaven." Apoc. 3: 5 : "I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father." Apoc. 20:15 "And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the pool of fire." Cf. Psalm 146: 4—5; Apoc. 20: 12. 31 Cf.

SCHMITZ display of power and lust of conquest. When he undertakes the free work of an intelligent appropriation of things, a man is on the way to meeting their Creator ; and the closer he gets to God, the more he and they come to be in His image. The activity of understanding is an act which by its nature enhances things. This too may be easily misunderstood. If we ask, What happens to a thing when it is simply known ? we must, of course, answer: Nothing happens to it at all. If a sheep is only perceived by a wolf, it is all the same to the sheep. On the other hand, if afterwards the sheep is eaten by the wolf that does make a difference. This latter union is one in which the being of one of the subjects is dissolved and that of the other fattened; one circumference collapses, the other increases. Physical union is a necessary condition for sensory perception and is especially intimate in sensations of touch, taste and smell. Yet it is because sight is least im mediately dependent upon physical contact that its awareness is least restricted and that it is the most open and discriminating mode of sensory perception.32 For all that, it would be an error to model a theory of understanding exclusively upon the perceptive powers of sight, and to represent the knower as a spectator spying out things from afar. For if sight anticipates the free openness of the activity of understanding, touch more deeply prefigures the intimate union which that activity achieves. Intimacy and openness, while they manifest a certain irrecon cilability at the level of sensory perception, together constitute the singular, spiritual nature of understanding. The spiritual openness of the human understanding in its fullest activity is achieved in the intimate co-presence of the being of the knower with the being of the known. In that spiritual community of knower and known the physical being of neither is altered. To be sure, although physical conditions are present in human knowing, they are not intrinsic to the intellectual co-presence of knower and known. It does not alter the book lying on the desk if it is known. The physical being of the book is in a certain sense indifferent to being known or unknown. The sense is this: The physical being of the book is not thereby engulfed within the circumference of the knower, nor does the knower increase the circumference of his own being through knowing. The union of knower and known has traditionally been called 32 St. Thomas, S. T. I, 78, 3c; 84, 2c. One can abandon St. Thomas' erroneous notion that the power of sight was enacted by a wholly "spiritual" immutation without abandoning the essential differences between seeing, hearing, touching, etc., as perceiving powers. Cf. G. Klubertanz, The Philo sophy Of Human Nature, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1953, pp. 103 III.</page><page sequence="31">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 253 intentional by philosophers to designate its non-physical character, and intellectual to designate its spiritual nature.33 Although we must insist that the co-presence of knower and known leaves the thing known unaltered, we must also insist that it is not an indifferent affair to things, whether they be known or not. Gray's desert flower does not bloom to remain unseen and unknown. To be sure, it is known to God, but can we perhaps say that it is not born to be unknown by its human master ? To those who fear such poetic sentiment, it may be put as a question of the relation of things to man. In modern times it has been a philosophical fashion to ask whether the world is as man understands it to be. Such an epistemology is heavily weighed with the egocentric individualism of the classical seventeenth and eighteenth century philosophies. Concretely it asks, for example, whether the tree "in itself" is green. The question presupposes that the tree is something which can be and can be considered in isolation from its world, from its relations with other physical beings, and from its relations with sentient and intelligent beings. This "tree in itself" suggests a kind of impenetrable •unit which stands alone, indifferent to the world of things, and in prin ciple beyond the realm of meaning. To seek the sensible qualities of the thing "in itself" is to suppose that physical beings do or can exist "in themselves" and to suggest that their being is indifferent to a meaningful relation with the human understanding. In truth, physical beings and human beings are citizens of the same world, and are subjects of being mutually involved with one another. That involvement reaches its peak in the open spiritual community of knower and known in the activity of human understanding. The ontological structure of a thing is an invitation for understanding. A being calls to be known, and a knowing power is an answer to that call. And when a created intelligence answers that call that thing is in some sense fulfilled. In what sense we must now try to understand. What is it to be known ? In what sense is a thing fulfilled by being known ? We may begin by saying, somewhat clumsily, that the thing which is known is elevated or sublimated. When the incarnate intelligence knows a thing, it establishes a relation of its own, a relation of reason or spirit, a relation of meaning with the thing which is known. We might say that it takes the thing 33 St. Thomas, S. T. I, 14, ic., on the equivalence of immateriality and knowledge. For a fuller explanation of the knowledge union, see E. Gilson, Elements of Christian Philosophy, New York, Doubleday, i960, pp. 226 ff. : G.

SCHMITZ into its household, that it lends it its light, or even that it gives the thing citizenship in the community of spirit. These, of course, are metaphors, and they are heavy with the taking and giving of physical alteration. We appeal to a better example. Let us imagine that we are gathered together in a room to honor a splendid man. Suppose again that a group of people enter. The honored guest asks who they are, and upon being told that they are John's friends he walks over and stands by John waiting to talk with him in friendship. Suppose further that John is unaware of his approach. John is not changed. Nevertheless he is enhan ced by association with the distinguished guest. It is as though he were taken into alliance, even into partnership, with the guest. In the eyes of his friends, and indeed in truth, John is taken up into the life of this revered person. And so too, when a human intelligence knows another person or physical being, that person or thing is taken up into the life of a spirit. The person or thing is ennobled by its invitation to a presence-in spirit. Certain tributes paid to the dead manifest the truth of what has been said. After a man of great spirit has died we instinctively honor his remains, for they have been involved in the great adventure which is his life. So too we are drawn by the same insight to look upon objects associated with him as enhanced by that association. Even the property of a powerful though depraved spirit can awaken a kind of morbid fascination in us. Moreover the reverence of relics is in its essential meaning neither morbid piety, nor superstitious belief in magic, nor a concession to popular religion. It is moved by the genuine realization that a great spirit enhances those things with which it is identified. The significance of this insight for the study, research and symbolic expression of nature is profound. When a chemist knows the strength of a chemical bond, or a physicist traces a sub-sensory particle, when a mathematician manipulates a set of numbers, or a psychologist observes animal behavior, when a biologist studies the structure of an organism or a poet sees new meaning and harmony in words: — whenever the intelligence of man is at work — it is as though the newly wrought Adam were walking once again in the primeval garden and ennobling all its beings by his conscious presence. And indeed every knower is the fallen Adam who like Milton's Lucifer still bears the dignity of his nature. The Greek poet wrote: Many are the wonders of the world, but none so wondrous as man. And in the mass the Church proclaims: Ο God Who has established the nature of man in wondrous dignity. Knowing, then, is an act proper to the nature of an incarnate spirit whereby, without in any way altering the physical being of the knower or known, it neverthe</page><page sequence="33">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 255 less enhances the being which things have within the total order of creation. Knowing does nothing for a thing, but it is better for the thing to be known. Knowing does nothing because it is not a doing. To be known is to be better because it is to be taken up into presence with a living spirit. What is this better? Just as the radical being of a thing is not to be misconstrued as a unit in isolation, so too the radical good of a thing is not to be misjudged in isolation from the universal order. Aristotle remarks that "all things are ordered together somehow, but not all alike — both fishes and fowls and plants ; and the world is not such that one thing has nothing to do with another, but they are connected. For all are ordered together to one end . . . All share for the good of the whole."34 St. Thomas says that "that which is best in things is the good of the order of the universe." The full goodness of things is the radiance which shines in them when they exist in due order. This order is neither one of static substances nor of absolute process ; it is ontological, an order of beings. It is through the life of the divine Being that things have their ordered natural goodness, for that ordered goodness of nature is possessed within the all-embracing creative omnipresence of the divine Intelligence. Within this living omnipresence the human understanding plays its natural role. When it knowingly stands open to things it lends them its own presence and fulfills its own nature by allowing things to participate in the life of spirit and in the spiritual order. The bewildering power of human evil brings its confusion deep into the heart of things, for it forces upon the things with which it associates an evil presence that can corrupt or at the least leave unrealized the natural intentionality of things towards a full ontological goodness. We are not here committing the anthropomorphic fallacy of attributing properly conscious, even spiritual, aspirations to things which do not have them. We are rather stretching human language in order to express the very real tendency of things towards inclusion in a spiritual order. Unless one is almost completely despiritualized, he views with horror the weapon in a particularly heinous murder, even though he knows that the weapon in itself is incapable of bearing guilt. This deep feeling is too easily explained away with talk of psychological association, vicarious experience and the like. That is certainly constitutive of the experience, but the horror is inseparable from the presence of the weapon itself. The 34 Metaphysics XII, ίο, 1075a 12—24. The quotation from St. Thomas is from S. T. I, 15, 2.</page><page sequence="34">256 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ ritual of religious purification is more to the point, and is no mere bygone superstition belonging to the supposedly overly fearful man of the past. It is rather a deep insight into the truth that things are not mere instru ments which remain indifferent to the spiritual struggle of good and evil. It is their own full destiny that is at stake. That destiny can be realized by man's masterful knowledge which can appropriate and enhance the things it knows. The activity of understanding is an act which, in union with Christ, can redeem things. We have insisted that the intellectual act is a privileged activity in this Christian universe because every intelligence by its nature can enhance things through knowing them. But when the human intel ligence which enhances things is, through the grace of God, a holy intelligence, a sacred temple of the Holy Ghost, then that intelligence can redeem the things it knows. For a holy intelligence, sanctified by God, the effort to understand nature is not only an effort to spiritualize and thereby make it anew; it is also and above all an endeavor with Christ to liberate things from their fallen state, that is, to redeem them. We must speak as precisely as possible here. It should be clear that persons cannot be redeemed simply by being known by other persons, although their being known may awaken in them a response of under standing and love. Indeed, are not the saints on earth vessels of grace and spiritual opportunity for other persons? And, if we desire their company with a worthy desire, is this not an earnest of salvation ? But it is different with things. When their master fell from grace the universe of subhuman things fell with him. St. Paul tells us that the universe groans under the weight of sin : If creation is full of expectancy, that is because it is waiting for the sons of God to be made known. Created nature has been condemned to frustration; not for some deliberate fault of its own, but for the sake of him who so condemned it, with a hope to look forward to ; namely, that nature in its turn will be set free from the tyranny of corruption, to share in the glorious freedom of God's sons. The whole of nature, as we know, groans in a common travail all the while.35 Recognizing the partnership of man and things the Psalmist calls upon subhuman things to proclaim the praises of God. Christ consecrates bread, wine and human sounds to the mutual redemption of all creatures. Both man and things need redemption and can receive it through Christ. Things, however, receive it properly through man who is their ordained 35 Romans 8: 19—21 (Knox Trans.).</page><page sequence="35">The Redemptive Role of the Knowledge of Nature 257 master in cooperation with Christ. Human persons can respond to Christ and other persons through intelligence, and things cannot. Nevertheless, things respond to intelligence. In the divine power of Christ, waters are stilled or transformed into wine, sensory organs are opened, physical organisms are brought back to life. The early Christians represented Christ as bringing the peace of a new order to the world of natural things, for their redemption had also begun. That redemption is an historical undertaking in which men and things are involved. The Christian intelligence is not the divine Intelli gence, but it is Its image and can play its humble and yet exalted part in the redemption of things. Each sanctified intelligence can help redeem the things with which it associates during its life by taking those things up into an appreciative intercourse with itself. Here too, surely, lies a deep significance for the Christian artist, who can take up into hands sanctified by Christ the things of the natural world so that they can play a role in the spiritual world of art. Christian art is much more than merely a psychological or apologetic instrument, of course; it is first of all art. But it is also an ontological transformation of the natural in the service of the mutual redemption of man and things. In a very special sense, however, and because of a long and intense association with nature, a sanctified intelligence, whether chemist's, physicist's, biologist's, psycho logist's or poet's, can participate in redeeming the things it knows. For redemption seen from the side of the redeemed is one term of a relation which is established by the redeeming intelligence and through the grace filled power of his sanctity. When a holy intelligence, sanctified by God, enters the world of things in answer to their call, things are enhanced by the nature of intelligence and are brought towards their redemption by the power of this intelligence-in-grace. It is easy, of course, to parody what has just been said, and to mis represent the redemptive act as a magical, isolated act of knowing, as though the knower were a kind of spiritual camera who intermittently takes shots of things. Rather, the knower is a life, and the incarnate knower undertakes an historical life of knowing. The mysterious redemp tion of the world will not be accomplished until the end of history, yet even now the student of nature plays his role in bringing nature towards its redemption. This is the meaning of an intellectual life devoted to the understanding of nature. The redemption of things through knowing is the full and proper and splendid association of their being with the life of incarnate spirit-in-grace. 17 Franciscan Studies 1964</page><page sequence="36">258 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ VI. What has not been said The explanation which has been given of the life of study is not a reason which will solve any problems in chemistry or biology; but it does give a profound meaning to a life dedicated to solving such problems. An antagonist might declare, however, that the best reason for solving such problems is simply that they are there to be solved. That, however, is just what we meant when we said that things ask to be known. We may put the objection in another way: to give any other reason for knowing than knowing itself is to betray the life of study; to say that one knows in order to redeem the things known displays an anti-intellectual depre ciation of the value of knowing itself, and that is an error which the first pages of this essay professed to put aside. It must be said in reply: Anti intellectualism depreciates the worth of knowledge by seeking outside of it a reason for a life of understanding. Quite the contrary, in saying that redemption is the reason for knowing, we have grounded the life of knowing within knowing itself, for the gratuitous term of redemption is a vision which is the very life of man and creatures within a new order of happiness. The Beatific Vision is knowing at its peak; it is face to face conscious presence to, with and in Him Who is the Truth in Whom we have our being and our final good.36 There is another possible misunderstanding. It may seem that we are putting forth a psychological and conscious motivation for one's every act of knowing, a kind of religious technique or pious gimmick. Not at all ! We are far from suggesting that, while he is studying nature, every Christian intellectual ought to constantly remind himself that he may be engaged in redemptive activity. Such a consideration would almost certainly distract him and thereby defeat his purpose ; for if he redeems, it is to the extent that he knows. At any rate, he may know his chemistry or physics ever so surely, but he never knows his condition in grace. For the Christian intellectual, it is sufficient to seek knowledge, and to ask for grace. Moreover these reflections intend to respect the mysterious and highly personal devotion between a deeply committed inquirer and the kind of understanding which he pursues. Nor do they forget that man is finite and that, although all forms of knowledge are valuable, for a man to seek all of them with equal ardor is but to scatter his genius. The study of nature at its best is a kind of love affair. One man pursues nature in chemistry, another in poetry, and it is sufficient to them that it yield itself to chemistry and to poetry.

And above all it is not an attempt to pre sent a psychological motivation which ought to, as it were, replace with a "higher" motive the "mere" interest in this or that form of inquiry. Such a false kind of piety has hindered the development of art and science among many Christian communities. On the contrary, these reflections are meant to free the already noble pursuit of natural truth in all its forms for its own tasks and satisfactions within a Christian world of grace. There is no attempt at all here to supply a non-scientific psycholo gical justification for the study of nature, because none is needed. We have simply tried to give an account of what, it seems to us, happens whenever an intelligence in grace takes up that pursuit. The most serious misunderstanding, however, would be to suppose that these reflections advance a kind of Christian rationalism according to which men would have an unconditioned claim to knowledge. Like all human activities, on the contrary, the pursuit of knowledge is condi tioned, for it is from beginning to end, the understanding of a finite and incarnate spirit which is seeking that knowledge. That historical pursuit is conditioned by ignorance, error and evil ; and a further, and perhaps, deeper reflection is required to come to grips more meaningfully with these forms of darkness. The metaphysical-theological tradition is aware of them as privations, but it refuses to consider evil as native to being or error essential] to truth. In addition to the mysterious threat of evil it traces our unknowing to two sources which are not privations but which are rather rooted in the ontological structure of our present relation to God. The first lies in our finitude. Hans Urs von Balthasar writes that in our concourse with other persons we are sometimes asked by love to leave unknown to us what should be known only to God and his creature, and what it would be a violation of the other person to uncover.37 Things, of course, are not persons, and yet it is also true that in our finitude we should approach them as though they too are worthy of a certain respect. It is only absolute rationalism and the most unthinking optimism that maintains that all knowledge of all things in all respects and at all times is an unconditional mandate for the sake of "progress." This does not mean that we should be fearful or even hesitant in advancing the frontiers of knowledge, but only that that advance like all human undertakings does not absolve us from judgment, and combines the risk of a false step with the promise of truth. 37 Hans Urs von Balthasar, "The Freedom of the Subject," in Cross Currents, vol.

The Christian revelation is able to be understood by us just to the extent that we can recognize that there is a common redemp tion of men and things ; how that redemption is every day realized about us is beyond our ken. It is sufficient that we strive to know in grace, and that we take up our task of knowing within the light of that mystery. It is knowledge enough to inspire the Christian intellectual, student, re searcher, poet, to pursue the truth reverently and fearlessly, reverently for its sake and fearless of his own. Such a person will want to become more and more learned and capable in his own discipline. He will want to reform himself more and more, and to bring his knowledge to the healing of man and nature. He will want to go out into the highways and byways to proclaim the redemptive truth. But the first creaturely act of redemp tion is to be found in the silent interior of that holy intelligence. To know is to enhance by nature, to know-in-grace is to redeem. The sanctified intelligence is the shepherd of being. The intelligences of men can be the shelters of beings who are returning home.
