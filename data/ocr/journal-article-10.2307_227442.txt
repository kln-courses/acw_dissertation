Philosophical aspects of mod- ern science. 344 pp. London: Allen &amp; Unwin; New York: The Macmillan Co., I943. $3.75 Not until the last two chapters of his book does Mr Joad tackle the business of saying what he has to say. "Reality is plural and con- tains a number of different orders or realms" (p. 258). These realms constitute a scale of values, as follows: "Scientific objects are appre- hended by minds at a certain stage of evolu- tionary development" (p. 289). Then "the aesthetic appreciation of beauty should be re- garded as a foretaste of the experience which life as a whole is seeking to realize" (p. 299). Finally, "the mystic is one in whom life has emerged at the highest level which it has yet reached" (p. 306). This view of the universe and of man's activi- ties commands respect by reason of the author's deep sincerity, but for no other reason that we can see. Mr Joad is one of those philosophers who, while rejecting traditional creeds "on the ground of the crude anthropomorphism which inspires them" (p. 32I), nevertheless believes in absolute values with all the tranquil assurance of the fundamentalist. His pronouncements on "goodness, truth and beauty" sound like an oration at a centenary of Victor Cousin. Now in aesthetics (leaving the discussion of mysticism to more competent pens) it is surely unfortunate to choose Bach's fugues as an ex- ample of the eternally beautiful. Bach's fame was considerable during his lifetime. But after his death he was practically forgotten, and his manuscripts remained unedited until Mendels- sohn began the single-handed campaign which progressively changed the public taste. This has now reached the point of adoration where Mr Joad meets most of his musical contemporaries, the reviewer included. One blushes to have to say that aesthetic judgments depend upon the time and the place, that "gothic" and "barbaric" were synonymous in French for some two hun- dred years, that Greek "archaic" sculpture was "ugly" from the 5th century B.C. until about I900. But Mr Joad will have none of these fluctuations. "If your uncle comes to Florence, or your wife's eclectic brother,-he will tell you that Raphael stands aloof from any other." (The Ufizi's ABC). The reader wonders why the two last chap- ters, valuable as the expression of a personal philosophy, should be preceded by nine others; and also what they have to do with modern sci- ence. Mr Joad must have sensed this reaction of his unseen audience, for he writes: "What bear- ing, it may be asked, has the nature of aesthetic experience upon the validity of the metaphysical speculation inspired by modern physics ?" (p. 312). His answer is, more or less, that his speculations on these different themes all hang together, which I will not deny; some irrever- ent reader might mutter that they also deserve to hang separately. Here is the type of ques-</page><page sequence="2">78 Reviews tion that Mr Joad asks himself. "Is a chair, for instance, a square piece of wood resting on four wooden legs, or is it a dance of atoms and electrons which are neither square nor wooden; or is it in some mysterious fashion both at once?" (p. 9). Surely a student of modern physics should be able to answer that one. The assumption that the chair is made of square pieces of wood is one that works well when the task is that of moving the chair from one place to another; the assumption that it is made of protons, neutrons and electrons is one that works well when the task is that of ex- plaining the chemical properties of cellulose, the scientific name for "wood." I have no doubt that these "assumptions" would not sat- isfy Mr Joad; for, believe it or not, he wishes to know what the chair really is. Didn't I tell you he was thinking like Mr Cousin? P.
