These stark spaces are devoid of almost any domestic associations. The occasional inclusion of a chair, whose role within the picture is too precise to allow it interpretation as a merely functional artefact, does not constitute a humanising of these sunless chambers, nor does that seem to be any part of the artist's intention. Rather than Ebrahim Ehrari, 'From Where to Where'. Etching. Photographs: Peter Neill. depictions of already extant spaces these almost completely empty rooms are being presented as arenas for particular images and action that Ehrari has chosen to present in a very particular way. The rather theatrical nature of these settings means that there is no mistaking the images as part of a narrative (although there may indeed be autobiographical content within them) but it is clear from the outset that these images are symbolically loaded. In almost all the prints Ehrari uses one or more linked spaces, sometimes containing slabs standing near or leaning against the walls, or some other rectangular feature ? window/picture, screen, 'easel' ? which can act as a vehicle for the animal, landscape and seascape images which appear almost as moving filmic projections, floating on the austere geometry of their architectural surroundings. This allows for the existence of at least two, and sometimes more, different visual realities in one image, as well as the possibility of one pictorial 'zone' being breached by the inhabitant of another apparently separate visual existence; for example in Frightened where a horse leaps ahead of encroaching waves out of a picture set on an easel-like stand. In other works such as My Horses and Barrier the action remains firmly fixed beyond the physical division of the wall, almost as though the horses were contained in some kind of sub-aquatic suspension. The horses in Ehrari's images are always horses in flight, startled, rearing creatures sometimes with bridles, rarely with saddles and never with riders. The absence of the human figure from the work emphasises a tendency to read the animal characters as correspondences to human spiritual conditions or aspirations. I felt this even without reading the rather odd section in the catalogue which was a kind of symbolic glossary, equating particular images, such as the bird with freedom, water with life, and the room with restricted freedom. I wondered, given that Ehrari is an Iranian, whether this was an actual visual code long established in Iranian or Persian visual language, which automatically elicited such interpretations from the viewer and which the artist was at pains to point out lest the message escape us. And yet there really was no need, since on the whole the images seemed quite capable of conveying a range of fairly subtle readings without having to embark on an exercise in symbolism-by-numbers.</page><page sequence="2">CIRCA 29 ?&gt;^!illlliiiRs^^ ^^^ ^^^^_H_____I &lt;^W__l__r' ' _______p^ Jtf ^ a vJ_o^&amp;__ * * * ^ V^P ?'f 'f_ffl_Hfift^ \/C'-f&gt;;j;?;^&gt;ii^__^_____B iSSP^ ______K.;^&gt;'^r $. li^m^i^H&amp;i^ '% -**i ,i |i|i^^B|||i^^^^^^^^i^HB^^^^ ^n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^i^^^^^m^^^^^^i^^s "^4^^&gt;_________ ___j_________t^^___ &lt;_&amp;iiw* iiii ^^^^^^^^_*v* " ^s_Jl'dL_^___Lw_?^*^^____ttJmm^__BS_f rf ?WllllllB^iilMl^w^^' Ebrahim Ehrari, Etching. Occasionally things became a bit unstuck, as they did in a print like The Last Struggle which, from the title at least was obviously attempting to deal with an issue of some import. I really could not help but find the sight of the unfortunate horse struggling to clamber out of a kind of tiled shaft in the floor into a rather Escher-ish labyrinthine surrounding just a bit comic, which is altogether different from humorous, however black. Ehrari's use of illusory spaces is sometimes the result of a strange combination of parallel perspective, after the style of Chinese painting, and perspective employing a vanishing point. Interpreting this in a symbolic way might be to force an analogy, but the resulting images are strangely disquieting. That these perspectival incongruities are intentional is fairly certain since it should be said that Ehrari is an accomplished draughtsman and an etcher of outstanding technique. Strangely then, this seems to militate against him since an initial reading of the work presents such a consistency of technique and an unvarying delicacy in the birds-egg hues and tints that the work as a body at first seems repetitive. For this reason the works which remained prominent in the memory were those which contained an element of the totally unexpected, especially where this element was not contained within the glossary of signs and symbols, or in fact within the realms of anything easily recognisable. One such work was From Where to Where, an interior with a hidden source of seemingly natural light streaming through two doors from a back space to the front, casting sharp shadows from vivid green beak, blade, bud-like forms poking up through the finely crazed floor. The floor seems to rise dramatically from the foreground to the rear of the space, the height of the dividing walls not being commensurate with one another. Unlike the horses in these prints the birds do not conform to one particular type or characterisation, which does work against the notion of a single symbolic interpretation for a particular motif. There is also a greater variety of scale ? from birds seen in flocks from a distance to huge malevolent cuckoo like creatures such as Firebird, bursting out of their framework of containment and filling the whole room. In A Chair for the Spectator a small bird something like a goldfinch appears greatly magnified on a large slab leaning against the wall, facing which is an old fashioned office-style chair. On its seat a green conical spike prevents any potential spectator from occupying the proffered space. Chairs appear in several of the prints, usually empty but occasionally seating an exotic fish as in The Miracle of the Sea. Again each one is a very distinct type of chair, lending themselves to more varied interpretation especially because of the anthropomorphic qualities of that particular article of furniture or the suggestion of the chair having recently been vacated. In To the Memory of Victor Jara a tomb-like slab has been slid away from a space in the wall to reveal a black void beyond; in front an elegant velvet covered chair faces outwards against which a guitar leans, conveying a strong sense of permanent departure. There is much that the viewer can identify and identify with in Ehrari's prints, since the basis of the work can be seen as a broad symbolism rather than a specific allegory. Possible personal or political references are therefore transferable and readable in other contexts. As I have suggested before, the technical virtuosity with which the etchings are executed sometimes comes close to rendering the strength or pertinence of the underlying idea impotent. Even the very expressive and apparently loose areas of the prints (and especially the three mixed media paintings) which provide the aqueous wave and lava-like formation in the backgrounds, have a calculation and control which robs them of spontaneity. There is a sense of fait accomplit in their own perfection. Deirdre O'Connell</page></plain_text>
