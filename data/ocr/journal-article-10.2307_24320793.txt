The new campus of Edison Community College symbolizes the importance and excitement of science in a rapidly growing state, and we are privileged to participate in celebrating the opening of this fine facility. The staff of ECC has enthusiastically supported the Annual Meeting and has helped us toward our goal of making this the best meeting yet. This is a year of change and beginnings for the Academy also, with our relocation to the beautiful new Orlando Science Center and the hiring of Geralyn Heartz as Executive Secretary to run our modern office. As Florida grows and changes, the need for interdisciplinary science also grows. New problems require new approaches. Our annual meetings have always brought together the experience and wisdom of established Florida scientists from many specialties with the energy and enthusiasm of the new scientific generation. The Academy's meetings provide an outstanding forum for crafting the interdisciplinary tools for guiding Florida into the future. MEETING INFORMATION The 61st Annual Meeting of the Florida Academy of Sciences will be held at the Punta Gorda Campus of Edison Community College March 13-15, 1997. Two symposia are scheduled: "Sunshine State Standards" and "Charlotte Harbor" (conducted by the National Estuary Program). LOCATION The new Punta Gorda campus of Edison Community College, site of the Annual Meeting of the Academy this year, is scheduled to receive its first students in January, 1997. The Academy Meeting is the first external academic program scheduled for this facility. Edison Community College (ECC) celebrates 35 years of service to Southwest Florida this year. Since the first students were admitted to ECC in the fall of 1962, the college has enrolled more than 150,000 students in credit courses. Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degrees are offered at ECC as well as one-year certificate programs. From its first quarters in the old Gwyne Institute Building in downtown Fort Myers, ECC moved to its permanent 135-acre campus in South Lee County in June 1965. Following a master plan designed to provide for growth and future needs, the Lee County Campus now includes eight permanent structures and the Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hail to meet the needs of students and a growing community. The University of South Florida at Fort Myers is located adjacent to ECC's Lee County Campus, offering expanded educational opportunities to students at both institutions. ECC's Collier County Campus opened in March of 1992. The beautiful campus is located on a 50-acre site near State Road 951 and Rattlesnake Hammock Road, in east Napies. Construction was recently completed for the</page><page sequence="5">l-'lorida Scientist iv Volume 60 third permanent campus, the Charlotte County Campus, in Punta Gorda. ECC receives its funding primarily from the State of Florida. Student fees and federal grants provide approximately one-third of the college budget, with individual and private grants supplementing the nearly two-thirds provided by state sources. The ECC Community College Foundation, Inc., provides more than $500,000 per year in aid to ECC students and programs. ECC is governed by its District Board of Trustees composed of nine representatives of Charlotte, Collier, Hendry, Glades and Lee Counties. The members are appointed to four-year terms by the Governor of Florida. Currently about 350 professional and support staff members provide the full-time instructional and related services for the more than 10,000 credit and 12,000 non-credit students who participate in ECC courses and programs each year.

SESSION A: BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY Wm. Jerald Kennedy, Florida Atlantic University, Presiding 8:30AM ANT-1 Periodontitis among Pre-contact South Florida Indians. JULIUS N. OBIN, MORTON H. KESSEL AND MEHMET YASAR 1SCAN, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton 33431. There is a controversy as to whether or not periodontitis is an ancient disease affecting all cultural groups. Because it is difficult to find a human population without generalized periodontal disease, it is usually necessary to have recourse to the jaw remains of ancient groups which had masticated natural unrefined foods throughout life. The purpose of this presentation is to describe the signs of periodontitis on the alveolar process thus enabling one to determine whether or not the disease was present in prehistoric skeletal populations. The dentition of Archaic Indian population (Republic Groves, 8HR4,2000 BC) has been investigated in terms of dental disease affecting both the teeth and the alveolar bone. All of the teeth displayed marked wear of enamel, including perforated occlusal sites causing alveolar manifestations of pulpits. Of particular interest is the minimal evidence of periodontitis; one individual is so diagnosed. This individual displayed the necessary criteria of periodontitis. These arc the loss of the surface cortical bone with exposure of the underlying porous cancellous interproximal bone and rounded margins of crestal bone. 8:45 AM ANT-2 Expressions of Sexual Dimorphism in the Lower Extremities of South African Blacks. M. YAÇAR IÇCAN AND MARY BARBOT ALLEN, Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Rd., Boca Raton, FL 33431. The purpose of this paper is to gauge sexual dimorphism in South African Blacks and to test the results of this study against current standards for American Blacks. Of particular importance are those bones which meet two criteria: namely, endurance and integrity in the face of elemental exposure and fragmentation, and sexual dimorphism. Select sites</page><page sequence="13">Florida Scientist 2 Volume 60 from the femur and tibia have been chosen accordingly. Osteometrie analyses were performed on the Raymond Dart skeletal scries housed by the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Out of a collection of 3,000 skeletons of known origin, a total of 90 individuals were examined and measured by the senior author. Subsequently all data was entered into SPSS-X for discriminant function analysis. From the tibia and femur 13 variables were chosen and compared with corresponding standards for American Blacks. Results of this study indicate that a certain ranking of variables exists, and that depending upon the long bone chosen, sex may be classified accordingly. 9:00AM ANT-3 Metric Analysis of Sexual Dimorphism in the Humerus of South Asians. C.A. KING, S.R. LOTH, AND M.Y. IÇCAN, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL 33431. Recent advances in forensic anthropology have shown that osteometric-based sex determination techniques must be developed for geographically diverse populations using contemporary skeletal material. The purpose of this paper is to assess sex differences in the south Asian humerus. The sample consisted of 181 adult skeletons of known age and sex from Chiang Mai University, Thailand, and the University of Hong Kong. A total of 7 variables were subjected to SPSSX subroutines. Because no significant differences were found between the two samples, they were combined. Stepwise discriminant analysis chose the optimal combination of dimensions, and the direct method evaluated measurements, singularly, and in combination. Vertical head diameter, minimum shaft diameter, and epicondylar breadth were selected by the stepwise procedure as the most discriminating variables resulting in 92.5% classification accuracy. The direct assessments developed functions from individual and combined variables to analyze fragmentary remains, and yielded accuracies ranging from 80.7% to 91.9%. These results are on a par with lower extremity bones from the same populations. 9:15AM ANT-4 Mandibular Ramus Flexure in Modern and Fossil Hominids. S.R. LOTH (1), and M. HENNEBERG (2), (1) Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, (2) Department of Anatomy, University of Adelaide Medical School, Adelaide, Australia. The overlap of male and female size differentials in the skeleton, variation across populations and over time, limit the usefulness of metric methods to determine sex. Morphologic differences, however, that are recognizable over time and across populations and species should lead to more reliable separation of the sexes. This paper presents just such a new morphologic indicator of sexual dimorphism (Loth and Henneberg, 1996). The sample consisted of 547 mandibles from adults of known sex, representing Africans, American whites, blacks and Amerinds from the Dart and Smithsonian</page><page sequence="14">1997 Meeting 3 Program Issue Collections. In adult males, there was a distinct angulation of the posterior border of the mandibular ramus at the level of the occlusal surface of the molars. In most females, the posterior border of the ramus retained the straight juvenile shape or if flexure was noted, it was either higher (at the neck of the condyle) or lower, in association with gonial eversion. Prediction accuracy ranged from 91% to 99% for subsamples of each population and surpassed 94% for the entire sample. Observations of fossil hominids and casts from australopithecines through early modems revealed the same configurations. In conclusion, sexing accuracy from ramus flexure is on a par with that from a complete pelvis. Its effectiveness stems from its origins as a male developmental trait only manifest consistently after adolescence and maintenance by optimal balance of the muscles of mastication. FRIDAY 9:30 AM, ROOM 203 in Classroom Bldg. SESSION B: CULTURAL/ETHNOHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY Wm. Jerald Kennedy, Florida Atlantic University, Presiding 9:30AM ANT-5 Empowered or Pressured? A Woman's Political Struggle in a Rural Mayan Community. D.M. GUTIERREZ, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton 33431. Based on fieldwork conducted in a rural community in Yucatan, Mexico, an ethnographic insight into a woman's political involvement and the risks of her involvement is provided. The influence of her family and friends on the extent of her political participation and the consequences of her participation as it affects her, her family, the community, and the state is further explored. How the political policies can create conditions within which women make decisions which shape their conceptions of politics is also shown. 9:45AM ANT-6 Bringing down the light: A study of a New Age millenarian group. NOAH TEITELBAUM. New College, 5700 N. Tamiami Tr., Sarasota 34243. "Ashtar 101," like all millenarian groups, is expecting and preparing for the world to change drastically though divine intervention. This group, one of many chapters in an international network, focused on channeled messages that reveal the true history of the earth as well as the upcoming arrival of angels, aliens, genetic regeneration, personal flying scooters and an overall spiritual Utopia. These were all to follow the landings that were supposed to have happened before the 17,h of Dec. 1996. After a description of the group and their beliefs there will be a discussion of different approaches to millenarian studies and finally an exploration of Ashtar 101's paradox, self-will vs. surrender to divine fate, in relation to the interaction between Clifford Geertz's religious models of and for the world.</page><page sequence="15">'lorida Scientist 4 Volume 60 I0:0()AM BREAK 10:15AM ANT-7 Approaches to the Study of the Shaman. S. L. SELKA, JR., Florida Atlantic University, P.O. Box 3091 Boca Raton 33431. A recent resurgence of interest in the shaman is noted, and several problems and questions in the study of shamanism are examined. These include whether it is justified to view the role of the shaman as a cross-cultural phenomenon capable of being defined in terms of common elements and characteristics; the question of the "sanity" or relative "normality" of the shaman and the concept of the shaman as a "neurotic" or as a "pathological" individual; and if a productive investigation of the process and significance of the practice of "shamanism" should focus on the individual experience and psychology of the shaman or rather on the functions and relationships of the shaman in the broader social context. Viewpoints of a wide array of scholars and researchers, ranging from experimental psychologists to anthropologists, are introduced, analyzed, and synthesized where possible. It is concluded that an analytically useful definition that captures the important features of the shaman cross-culturally is possible, and such a definition is introduced; the shaman is not a "madman" but an individual that lives a culturally constructed and approved life; and that a holistic approach to the study of the shamnan that is well grounded in ethnographic observation is needed. 10:30AM ANT-8 Archaeological and Historical Analysis of Arthur, 'King of the Britons.' N. LABOS, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton 33431. The controversy surrounding the historical figure of King Arthur resides chiefly in the legends which are associated with him. For many decades the figure behind these legends was ignored and given little scholarly attention. Only in recent years have any efforts to discern the Arthur of fact from the Arthur of fiction been made. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research proposal to better understand his historical and political contributions to Britain, and the impact his leadership had on subsequent generations. His brief reign had such a tremendous influence on his contemporaries that they expanded his image into heroic proportions. Any further developments in this area can only be determined by the relation of historical facts to archaeological evidence dating back to the fifth century when Arthur ruled post-Roman Britain. A comparison is made with known archaeological sites and historical sources (including original manuscripts). The weapons, armor, battles and foreign policy of Arthur's military leadership as well as the remnants of Roman civilization, which primarily affected the government and politics of the tumultuous period are discussed. 10:45 AM ANT-9 Indications of Cultural Change in Early Eighteenth Century Georgia. DANIEL HUGHES.Anthro. Dept, Florida Atlantic Univ.,</page><page sequence="16">1997 Meeting 5 Program Issue 111 Galdes Road, P.O. Box 3091, Boca Raton, Fl 33431-0991. Just prior to the American Revolution a changing set of cultural values were taking place in the colonies. The colonists were acting upon desires to be free from the control of a culture with whom they had lost touch. No longer did colonists feel they should be treated as lesser citizens of England. The development of a large merchant class equal in wealth to many members of the aristocratic class led to changing levels of status and equality in the colonies. The goal of this paper is two fold. The first is to show how historical documents can be used to test anthropological theories of cultural change. The second is to prove that combinations of distance from strong power centers of English authority and environments with limited resources on the edge of the colonial frontier, allowed individuals to express feelings of equality to those stationed above them by birth. The paper shall document a period in the life of Andrew Duché, a potter in Savannah, Georgia who resisted both local authority and the Trustees of the Georgia colony. He is an example of the changing cultural value system that would sweep the colonies in the years prior to the Revolution. 11:00AM ANT-10 God and God the Despot: A Cognitive Approach to Anthropomorphism and Dogmatism in Early Islamic Theology. Kamal FERIALl. University of Florida, Department of Anthropology. A cognitive approach to religious thought is not only legitimate, but is dictated by the nature of religion itself. Although religious belief may be shaped by various ecological, political, economic and historical particularistic factors, it remains, in essence, a mental function and, therefore, a product of the human mind and is limited by its constraints. It is from this perspective that 1 approach the issue of the anthropomorphization of the deity, particularly in Islam, and how anthropomorphizing relates to dogmatism. I argue that religious dogmatism is essentially a cognitive process which may be systematically outlined using cognitive findings in anthropology, psychology, linguistics and religious thought itself. At the core of religion, the idea of a "transcendent" God can be discerned. This abstraction, however, is often cognitively optimized through its endowment with human like characteristics. It is when this transformed entity is espoused at some point and the original "transcendent" one slips into oblivion, that a form of what we call "religious dogmatism" evolves. 11:15AM ANT-11 The Ultimate Cup of Joe: An Interdisciplinary Examination of Black Drink.

KESSEL AND MEHMET YASAR ISCAN. Mounds of a characteristic style, with an architectural and artistic similarity are unique to south Florida. Located in the area around lake Okeechobee and nowhere else, they offer an insight into cultural tradition, the lifeways and the cognitive processes of the builders. These atypical earthworks, decribed elsewhere as circular-linear, and named here with the more descriptive term "finger mounds", are examined spatially and temporally to distinguish them from purely circular or purely linear erathwork mounds. 2:15PM ANT-13 Aboriginal Canoe Canals of Cape Sable, R. J. WHEELER, C.A.R.L. Archaeological Survey, Bureau of Archaeological Rsch., 1625 NW3T' Place, Gainesville, FL, 32605. The Mud Lake and Snake Bight canals were dug by Indians to facility canoe travel between Whitewater Bay and Florida Bay. Like other prehistoric long distance canals in Florida these features were designed to provide safe passage, easy access to aquatic resources, and courses for exchange or tribute. John K. Small, pioneer naturalist, provided the first scientific description of the Mud Lake Canal, noting its proximity to the Bear Lake Indian mounds. Using older descriptions and aerial photographs the courses of both canals have been partially reconstructed. It is hypothesized that the Snake Bight Canal is the older of the pair, and may have been damaged by a hurricane; the Mud Lake Canal was built to replace the damaged canal. Both canals would have allowed the inhabitants of the Bear Lake Mound group to control, canoe traffic moving between southeastern Florida, the Florida Keys, and the Ten Thousand Islands. 2:30PM ANT-14 The Role of Environmental Archaeology in. Studies of Global Climatic Change: A Charlotte Harbor Case Study, K. J. WALKER</page><page sequence="18">1997 Meeting 7 Program Issue AND W. H. MARQUARDT, Florida Museum of Natural History, P. O. Box 117800, Gainesville 32611. We present archaeological and geological evidence for small-scale, Late Holocene sea-level fluctuation along Florida's Gulf coast, primarily based on data generated in Charlotte Harbor but also from northwest Florida. Drawing data from archaeological middens, zooarchaeological gradient analysis of modern and archaeological mollusks, and independent dating of sediments along the barrier islands undertaken by Frank Stapor and his associates, we propose a model of Florida Gulf coast sea level: (1) 40 to 60 cm below today's mean sea level (MSL) prior to A.D. 100; (2) a rise to present MSL ca. A.D. 100-200; (3) 70 to 130 cm above present MSL ca. A.D. 200-500; and (4) a fall to a low of at least 50 cm below today's MSL by A.D. 600. These fluctuations can be correlated with global climatic episodes documented by climatologists. With the exception of locations dominated by alluvial processes, the Gulf coast - especially the Charlotte Harbor Estuarine System - is an excellent laboratory for the interdisciplinary study of global climatic change.

L.M. WILLIAMS (1) and J.R. MONTAGUE (2), (1) Biology Department, Florida A&amp;M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307, (2) SNHS, Barry University 11300 NE 2nd Avenue, Miami Shores, FL 33161. Two replicate feeding tests with adult sea urchins were conducted in 20-liter sea water tanks (25 °C) during Summer 1996. The urchins were starved for 48 hours, and then offered equal proportions of green and decayed blades of T. testudinum and S. filiformes; the exposed blades (5-cm) were attached to nylon rope buried in sand. The urchins consumed the blades in equal proportions, and displayed no apparent preference for any particular blade type. This probably represents the general foraging behavior expected for herbivores which face relatively low energetic costs during travel but relatively high energetic costs during digestion.

ALLEN F. SANBORN AND SAMANTHA MATE NANKERVIS, Barry University, School of Natural and Health Sciences, 11300 N.E. Second Avenue, Miami Shores 33161. Temperature effects all aspects of a cicada's life, from the rate of neural firing to signaling when a population will emerge. Ectothermic animals must regulate body temperature to maximize physiological efficiency under changing environmental conditions. This is especially important in acoustically signaling organisms whose mate attraction system may be altered by temperature. With this study we investigate the thermoregulatory strategy of Diceroprocta olympusa (Walker) and try to determine if the temporal parameters of the calling song are correlated with body temperature. We found that D. olympusa regulates body temperature through behavioral mechanisms. Analysis of the calling song shows the call is a constant frequency call produced by a repetition of sound pulses. Mean peak frequency of 10,123 + 1,113 Hz (n=34) is a result of the physical structure of the sound producing system. The timbals contract alternately and a single timbal contraction produces a main pulse produced as the timbal plate buckles followed by three smaller pulses as the timbal ribs buckle. Individual sound pulses are produced at a rate of 94.88 + 4.82 Hz (n=34). We found that pulse rate was correlated to body temperature. 9:45AM BlO-6 Implications of Nonanthropogenic Sources of Fecal Coliform Bacteria in Natural Waters in Northeast Florida. V.J. HARWOOD, K. STOOK, R. O'TOOLE, S. AGARWAL AND V. WAGNER. Department of Natural Sciences, University Of North Florida, 4567 St. Johns Bluff Rd. South, Jacksonville, FL 32224-2645. Water samples were collected from the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County, and assayed for total and fecal coliform bacteria. Five percent of positive fecal coliform samples were further analyzed for</page><page sequence="21">Florida Scientist 10 Volume 60 the presence of £. coli. Samples routinely tested positive for fecal coliforms, but only a small percentage were identified as E. coli. In order to determine the possible nonwarmblood sources of bacterial contamination, the cloacae of diamondback terrapins collected from a nesting beach on the Nassau River (Duval County) were sampled for fecal coliform bacteria and Salmonella species. No positive results for Salmonella were obtained, however one turtle out of 26 (~4%) tested positive for fecal coliforms. Since fecal coliforms are the most widely used indicator organisms for human fecal pollution, and their presence has been used to close shellfishing beds in Duval and St. Johns County, a better understanding for the sources of contamination and the species represented by this group is necessary, as well as the establishment of additional water quality indicators which accurately reflect the potential for human illness. 10:00AM BREAK 10:15AM BIO-7 Field Testing Models of Intraspecific Nest Parasitism in Passerines. B. A. HAM1LL, E. J. BIERHANZL, and D. J. MIL1NKOV1CH. Departments of Biology and Economics, Florida A&amp;M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307. The use of molecular measures of genetic relatedness have provided an intriguing view into the mating behavior of a number of species of monogamous passerines. Initially, studies focused on adult males raising genetically unrelated offspring resulting from cuckoldry. In this paper, however, we consider the consequences of intraspecific nest parasites. Egg-dumping by females results in both parents investing energy and resources in one or more genetically unrelated offspring. Reports suggest rates of intraspecific parasitism ranging from &lt;2% to over 20% among different populations of Eastern Blue Birds (Sialia sialis).The cost of rearing altricial young would seem to select against parents that squandered their energy/resources on genetically unrelated young. Conversely, selection should favor the female that not only raises a full clutch of her own, but is able to produce a additional young with the unwitting help of a neighbor. Using a regression-based model, we generate predictions on the costs, benefits, and occurrence of intraspecific nest parasitism under a variety of conditions. Among the variables considered are: clutch size, time of season, first or second clutch, age of female, territory quality, male attentiveness to nest, female attentiveness to nest, population density, and neighbor proximity. Preliminary results suggest that a number of factors interact to determine rates of parasitism within a population. Female attentiveness, measured as time at the nest, is inversely correlated with likelihood of being parasitized. The predictions generated by the model are currently being used to design field experiments. Blue bird nest boxes set up at two locations outside Tallahassee, FL allow an ideal situation to test various aspects of the model in the field.</page><page sequence="22">1997 Meeting 11 Program Issue 10:30 BlO-8 Role of the Egg Capsule in Protection of Embryonic Applesnails from Ultraviolet Light. R. L. TURNER AND S. L. WILLIAMS, Department of Biological Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, 150 West University Boulevard, Melbourne 32901-6975. The aquatic Florida applesnail, Pomacea paludosa, lays clutches of eggs on stems of emergent plants, where embryogenesis proceeds to hatching over a 2-wk period, during which the clutch is fully exposed to sunlight. Two components of the egg might provide protection to embryos from UV light (viz., UV-B, 280-320 nm): the extracapsular jelly and the calcareous capsule. Methanolic extracts of jelly did not absorb in the range of UV-B radiation nor in the range indicative of microsporine-like amino acids (MAA; 310-340 nm). Transmittance of light through hemispherical eggshells was reduced to 99.98% in the UV-B range. The Florida applesnail does not use biological sunscreens (MAA) in mucus as do many shallow-water marine invertebrates for UV-protection. but the thin (40-micron) calcareous capsule offers a high level of protection, perhaps through a combination of reflectance and absorbance. In addition, the early embryo might gain protection by the extraembryonic albumen and the late embryo by melanin formation and the body shell. 10:45 AM BlO-9 Comparative Ecological Succession of the Former Ft. George Island Golf Course Fairways, Duval County. J. L. RANDALL, Department of Natural Sciences, University of North Florida, 4567 St. Johns Bluff Rd., Jacksonville, 32224. Natural ecological succession of the former Ft. George Island Golf Course fairways is examined after four years of abandonment. Three former fairways are compared in order to show the floristic similarities and differences in succession patterns among ecologically similar sites. Comparisons are based on species composition, density, frequency, and importance values. A qualitative, visual comparison is also made among one, three, and four year stages of succession.

The Beaches of Brevard and Indian River Counties include a series of land parcels which are part of a regional protected area network (PAN), the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge (ACNWR). Utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS), and natural resource information (species, communities, landscape context), individual agency management information was evaluated. Recent conservation biology protocols for reserve design were modified for management planning to develop a coordinated natural resource management plan for the South Beaches PAN. A modified form of the minimal set algorithms technique (Nicholls and Margules 1993) and a modified form of gap analysis (Scott et al. 1990) were used to develop management recommendations for the South Beaches PAN.</page><page sequence="23">I lorichi Scientist 12 Volume 60 1 1:15AM BIO-11 Présentement Environments of the Lower Myakka River. B. WHARTON, HDR Engineering, 5100 W. Kennedy Blvd., Tampa 33609. The Myakka River was first explored in the 1500s and the first accurate navigational chart of the river was published in 1774. During Florida's territorial days, several exploration parties penetrated the Myakka River, most notably the John Lee Williams exploration (1828) and the Hackley-Murray-Prior expedition (1832), and left a tantalizing record of their observations. During early statehood, General Land Office surveyors laid out the current system of townships and sections across the region and documented in their field notes and plat maps a vast open pine and savanna landscape bisected by a picturesque river swathed in an oak-cabbage palm hammock. Analysis of this historical data distinguished three zones along the river corridor: (1) an upper freshwater zone with a narrow, well-incised river channel backed by a thin riparian oak-palm hammock, (2) an intermediate brackish water zone with a gradually widening river channel backed by a brackish marsh, and (3) a lower brackish water zone with a broad river channel backed by brackish marsh, and mid-channel mangrove islands and cedar islands. Despite considerable recent development, much of today's Myakka River corridor bears a striking similarity to its presettlement counterpart. FRIDAY 11:30 AM, ROOM 201 in Classroom Bldg.

The elephant seal of the south, Mirounga leonina, is found along the coast of Patagonia, Argentina. A major characteristic of elephant seals is their ability to maintain apneas for extended periods of time, both on land and in water. As they progress in age, changes in their apnea-eupnea cycling patterns are observed. It is hypothesized that these changes are in response to a greater demand for this trait as they advance from the land-living, non-diving pups to theocean-diving, food-foraging adults. There is a progressive increase in mean apnea lengths at each new age group</page><page sequence="24">1997 Meeting 13 Program Issue with a simultaneous decline in breathing rates, indicative of greater efficiency at utilizing the air breathed.

SANBORN, Barry University, School of Natural and Health Sciences, 11300 N.E. Second Avenue, Miami Shores 33161. A study of the insect biodiversity was carried out on the university grounds. The situation and characteristics of the study site made it a good example for most of South Florida's urban areas. Habitats included extensive turf/garden areas as well as a highly degraded pine scrub plot. Species were classified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. An excess of 325 species representing 18 orders were collected and identified. The greatest numbers of species were collected in the Diptera and Coleoptera. Biodiversity is also assessed indirectly by comparison with well known insect group populations from the region. A special interest is placed upon exotics and their effect on native insects. 3:00PM BIO-14 Presence of the Ophiuroid Primary Circlet as an Indicator of Disturbance. J.M. L1ESMAN, Department of Biological Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, 150 West University Boulevard, Melbourne 32901-6975. The brittlestar Ophiophragmus filograneus easily casts off its disc in response to predators, storms, and other disturbance factors. Upon regeneration, the brittlestar is unable to replicate the primary circlet, a cluster of six central disc plates formed early in juvenile development. This study uses the presence and absence of the circlet as an indicator for evaluating the impact of disturbance on populations of () filograneus. Adult brittlestars were sampled at one site by corer and sieve every 3 wk beginning September 1995 and during a year of no recruitment. Brittlestars were sized (aged) by measuring oral-frame diameter and categorized for presence or absence of the primary circlet. Using Kendall's rank correlation, the frequency of brittlestars with the primary circlet was ranked against size of the oral-frame. There was a strong inverse relationship: frequency of the circlet decreased as size increased. The relationship reflects the cumulative impact of disturbance on the population. Further work will examine the relationship in a second year of study, an additional site in the second year, and in a population with successful recruitment from the 1980s. 3:15PM BIO-15 Diet and Feeding Biomechanics of the Sheepshead, Archosargus prob otocephalus.

The sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus</page><page sequence="25">Florida Scientist 14 Volume 60 (Pisces: Sparidae), is commonly found in a variety of habitats including seagrass beds, piers, rocky jetties and offshore reefs. It is a trophic generalist, feeding on a wide variety of prey species such as soft-bodied polychaete prey and hard shelled crabs and molluscs. In this study, the volumetric contribution of prey items consumed by sheepshead in six study sites along the east central coast of Florida was investigated. Field collections were made from November 1995 to October 1996. Intraspecific comparisons revealed that sheepshead consumed significantly different prey organisms (e.g. algae, amphipods, bivalves and crabs) among the variety of habitats examined (Kruskal-Wallis test; p&lt;0.05). Dietary differences may be associated with fish size, and temporal and spatial variation in prey availability. The relationship between variation in feeding habit and feeding biomechanics in sheepshead found in different habitats will be discussed. 3:30PM BIO-16 Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) Nesting at Wekiwa Springs State Park, Florida: A Preliminary Report. M. SHANE BELSON, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando 32816. The Red-headed Woodpecker is typically considered a bird of the sandhills. At Wekiwa Springs State Park, Red-headed Woodpeckers breed in habitat ranging from xeric sandhills to hydric pine flatwoods and bayhead edges. Sixty-two nest snags and the surrounding vegetation were quantitatively measured, as were roost snags of both adults and juveniles. Nests were monitored for double brooding. At least 23 birds were banded and both nest site fidelity and dispersion were observed. The effects of fire on potential nest and roost snags and ways to prevent their destruction were investigated. This research is supported by the Florida Park Service, Florida Ornithological Society, Gopher Tortoise Council, and Citizens for Wekiva Basin GEOpark. 3:45PM BIO-17 Hunting Behavior in the Tarantula Hawk Wasp, Peps is thisbe (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae). F. PUNZO. Dept. of Biology, Univ. ofTampa, 401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Tampa, FL 33606. The ethnogram for hunting behavior in P. thisbe is described. Behavioral components of hunting include initial approach and antennation of the host, grooming, paralyzation, lapping (in some cases), oviposition, burial, and closure of the burrow. Female wasps exhibited a bimodal diel activity. The spider is most frequently stung through the intersegmental membrane between the sternum and coxa of the first leg. Whether or not a wasp exhibits lapping behavior is determined by the amount of time spent in flight searching for a host burrow. 4:00PM BIO-18 Taxonomic relationships within the Agkistrodontini. D.S.

The Agkistrodontini is a tribe of snakes composed of large head-scaled,</page><page sequence="26">1997 Meeting 15 Program Issue rattleless pitvipers. Using a morphology based cladistic analysis, it was determined that the Agkistrodontini is a paraphyletic grouping with a minimum of 5 monophyletic genera. Of particular interest is the placement of the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) with the Asian genus Gloydius. In addition, the copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) was determined to be a monotypic genus. This suggests the need for a major nomenclatural revision of the genus Agkistrodon as Agkistrodon contortrix is the type specimen for the genus and may now be the only valid species for the group. 4:15PM BlO-19 Innervation of the Supranasal Sac in the Puff Adder, Bitis arietans. D. S. YORK (1), T. M. SILVER (1), AND A. A. SMITH (2), (1) School of Health and Natural Sciences, (2) School of Podiatric Medicine, Barry University, 11300 NE 2nd Ave., Miami Shores, FL 33161. The supranasal sac is an invagination of the skin between the supranasal and nasal shields of many true vipers. We have found nerve endings in the supranasal sac of the puff adder, Bitis arietans. that resemble the nerve endings in the pit organ of pit vipers. We suggest that the supranasal sac of true vipers, like the pit organ of pit vipers, is a heat detector. This would explain the known preference of puff adders and Russell's viper for warm prey. 4:30PM BIO-20 Hydrological Effects on Tree Growth Rates and Age Correlations in Wetland Reclamation in North Florida. M. S. BATTS, The Phoenix Environmental Group, Inc., 2916 E. Park Ave., Tallahassee 32301. Successful reclamation of mined lands in North Florida are influenced by many factors. Hydrology and age are two of the most important factors in maximizing growth rates of planted trees and the overall ecological well being of the reclaimed systems. Hydrological fluctuations consistent with rainfall patterns enhance the overall growth rates of planted wetland trees. Planted trees experiencing hydrological cycles consistent with rainfall events displayed the highest growth rates among 18 reclaimed areas. Age of the reclamation system appears to positively influence water quality, vegetation cover, decreased exotic and nuisance vegetation species occurrence, total carbon in the soil, regeneration, and overall habitat value. Using qualitative bioassessment techniques and statistical linear correlations, the assumption that wetland reclamation improves with time is supported. 4:45 PM BIO 21 The MacArthur Agro-ecology Research Center - An Integrated Research Program to Develop Sustainable Cattle Production Systems for Florida.

DAVID BRUDERLY, Bruderly Engineering Associates, Inc., 1826 N W 57th Terrace, Gainesville, Florida 32605-3357. Landfills are the least-cost method of solid waste disposal in Florida. Unfortunately, organic material deposited in landfills will decompose through biological processes and form a complex mixture of gases comprising methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen and trace amounts of a large number of organic and inorganic compounds. These gases diffuse through the waste and cover system, and escape to the atmosphere. The reactive organic gases are major sources of air pollution, and the methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Estimates of the pollution produced in Florida by this method are presented, as well as voluntary and regulatory methods of control which are being implemented. The paper also discusses the available technology and economics for recovery, clean up and conversion of landfill gas to liquefied methane and carbon dioxide, and describes how public officials and landfill managers may design a program for capture and use of landfill gas in productive applications.</page><page sequence="28">1997 Meeting 17 Program Issue 3:15 PM ENG-2 A Simulation of the Manufacturing Process of a Cast Steel Roll for a Hot Strip Mill.

City of Tallahassee, Presiding ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL SCIENCE Friday 8:00 AM, ROOM 202 in Classroom Bldg. SESSION A Barbara Martin, University of South Florida, Presiding 8:00AM ENV-1 Useful Applications of Diamagnetism, ROBERT F. BENSON, BARBARA B. MARTIN, DEAN F. MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620 AND ROLAND K. CARPENTER, AquaMagnetics® International, Inc. 915-B Harbor Lake Drive, Safety Harbor, FL 34695. Diamagnetism is useful for treatment of water for scale prevention. The approach has been used for a century, but it still has controversial aspects. We believe that a model based upon the increase in entropy of a system in the presence of a magnetic field is useful for understanding the process. The Van Vleck equation will be described as a useful tool, and examples of the utility of diamagnetism will be provided. 8:15 AM EN V-2 The Magnetic Separation of Iron from Phosphate Ore. CHUHUA WANG, EILEEN PEREZ, BARBARA B. MARTIN, ROBERT F. BENSON, AND DEAN F. MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. Iron is one of impurities in wet processed phosphoric acid (WPA) and ferric ion is identified as a major sludge-forming impurity in shipping grade of WPA due to its significant contribution to postprecipitation. Magnetic methods were used to remove the paramagnetic material containing iron species from phosphate ore before reaction with sulfuric acid. Aqueous ore suspension with particle size of 18-120 mesh (0.125 - 1 mm diameter) was passed horizontally through a Y-tube, to which was attached on one side two 2000- gauss strength magnets. At optimum conditions, the iron content in ore from magnet side was 9.5% -16.7 % higher than that from the non-magnet side. This magnetic apparatus has the potential for iron removal in phosphate industry without extra energy costs. This research is supported by the Florida Institute of Phosphate Research. 8:30AM ENV-3 Effects of Physical and Chemical Comminution on the Beneficiation of Phosphate Rock, ROBERT F. BENSON AND DEAN F.</page><page sequence="30">1997 Meeting 19 Program Issue MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620. The similar responses of calcium carbonate minerals and phosphate rock to many beneficiation processes have hampered the utilization of many low-grade phosphate rock deposits. Since the comminution of most phosphate rock is carried out in a ball mill, little attention has been given to the potential, for selective size reduction and classification as a means for beneficiation. Results from attrition milling and hydrocyclone classification of low-grade phosphate rock will be presented. 8:45 AM ENV-4 Solubilization of Sodium Fluorosilicate Scale Using Diamagnetism, CHUHUA WANG, EILEEN PEREZ, ROBERT F. BENSON, AND DEAN F. MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250. Diamagnetism was used to enhance the solubility of sodium fluorosilicate scale in phosphoric acid. Previous research (Benson et al. 1994. J. Environ. Sei. Health, A29: 1553-1564) has indicated the basis of enhanced solubility of particles in the presence of a magnetic field (an enhancement of the entropy of the system). The principle was applied to sodium fluorosilicate in the presence of fields of the order of 1200 gauss, and the solubility in 28% phosphoric acid was consistently enhanced by 50 % at room temperature. Implications of the research, supported by the Florida Institute of Phosphate Research, will be considered. 9:00AM ENV-5 A Preliminary Examination of the Effects of a Magnetic Field on the Viability of Four Algae, BARBARA B. MARTIN, DEAN F. MARTIN, AND LINDA D. BISNAUTH, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620. The effects of magnetic fields (nominally 1200 gauss, generated by permanent magnets) on the growth of selected model organisms are summarized. For single-celled marine organisms (Gymnodinium breve and Nannochloris oculata) viability was measured as cell counts as a function of time. For filamentous algae (cyanobacteria), total chlorophyll was used to infer viability. G. breve , but not N. oculata was adversely affected by a magnetic field during a two-day period. Lyngbya majuscula and Oedegonium foveolatum were affected by a magnetic field during a two-week period. 9:15AM ENV-6 Investigation of a Freon-Free Nonvolatile Residue Test for Space Flight Hardware. C.A.CLAUSEN, J. GU1DRY, AND C.M.CLAUSEN. Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando,32816. Liquid oxygen is used as the oxidizer for the liquid fuel main engines during the launch of the space shuttle. Any hardware that comes into contact with pure oxygen either during servicing of the shuttle or in the operation of the shuttle must be validated as being free of nonvolatile residue (NVR). This is a safety</page><page sequence="31">Florida Scientist 20 Volume 60 requirement to prevent spontaneous combustion of carbonaceous NVR if it were to come into contact with pure oxygen. Previous NVR validation testing of space hardware used freon (CFC-113) as the test solvent. Because CFC-113 no longer can be used, a program was conducted to develop a NVR test procedure that uses a safe and environmentally friendly solvent. This paper will describe the work that has been conducted on the use of water as the test solvent. Equilibration of the NVR from the hardware part into the water was found to be facilitated by the use of ultrasonic energy. The wash solution is then tested for the presence of NVR by measuring the total organic carbon concentration (TOC). For the validation of large parts, a procedure was developed for concentrating the NVR prior to TOC analysis. 9:30AM ENV-7 Reductive Dehalogenation of Trichloroethene Using Zero Valent Iron and UltrasonicEnergy. C.L.GEIGER1, C.A.CLAUSEN1, D. REINHART2, N. RUIZ2, G. AFIOUN11, P. TOY1, N. LAO1. Departments of Chemistry1 and Environmental Engineering2, University of Central Florida, Orlando,328l6.Because chlorinated solvents are so versatile in their application they have found use throughout our society. This has resulted in a wide spectrum of contamination problems. Because of the limited success in remediating contaminated sites by pump-and-treat techniques, considerable effort is being directed toward the development of in situ treatment methods. The methodology that is being studied is based upon the generation and use of in situ chemically reactive permeable treatment walls for remediation and containment of groundwater plumes contaminated with chlorinated solvents. The rate of degradation of TCE has been increased by using reactive metal (i.e. iron) of high surface area. However, because this process reduces the iron, it is inherent in the system that corrosion of the iron surface occurs. As TCE is converted to ethane, the pH of the system increases causing precipitates to form on the iron surface and slowing the rate of TCE removal. Preliminary work suggests that periodic in situ treatment of the reactive wall with ultrasound can enhance and restore the degradation rate of the active metal. 9:45AM ENV-8 Establishing a Laboratory for Physical Environmental Sciences at Valdosta State University. THOMAS J. MANNING, Dept. of Chem., Valdosta St. Univ., Valdosta, Ga. 31698 Valdosta State University, located in Lowdnes County (GA), on the Florida border, is establishing a laboratory for physical environmental sciences that will interact with the states pulp and paper industry. Equipment committed to the facility include a ICP AES, ICP-MS, FFFF-MALLS system, particle size analyzer, carbon analyzer, UV/VIS spectrometer, and a 300 MHZ NMR. The facility, which will come on</page><page sequence="32">1997 Meeting 21 Program Issue line in July 1997, will work with industry to help them solve problems. The talk will discuss details of this facility. 10:00AM BREAK 10:15AM ENV-9 Physiochemical Studies on the Biliprotein Pigments in Representatives of Two orders of Pelagic Cnidarians: Physalia physalis and Velella velella. CLIFF I. ROSS, J. WILLIAM LOUDA, AND FRANK MARL Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Rd. Boca Raton, Fl. 33431. Physalia physalis (Portuguese man-of-war) and the Velella velella (by-the-wind-sailor) are brightly pigmented members of the pleustonic community of tropical and subtropical waters (Zaitsev, 1964; David, 1967) whose range occasionally extend into temperate areas. The toxic properties of the nematocysts of these organisms have been previously described (Lane, 1960), but the biochemical nature of their characteristic pigmentation has not been extensively investigated (Ball &amp; Cooper, 1947 and Herring, 1970). A more detailed study has been carried out in order to determine the relationship between the biochemistry and function of the pigments of Physalia and Velella. Previous work has indicated that the coloration of Physalia is due the presence of biliproteins. Bilins are tetrapyrrole chromophores found covalently attached to biliproteins that are responsible for color. A biliprotein mixture has been isolated from Physalia and Velella collected off the coast of Boca Raton, Florida. The isolation procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography as well as SDS and 1EF electrophoresis. Further separation was conducted via HPLC. Final analysis of the biliproteins and their prosthetic groups was carried out by NMR spectroscopy, UV-VIS, and Fluorescence spectroscopy. The results from the isolation and characterization procedure and a comparative analysis of the pigmented proteins found in these organisms will be discussed. 10:30AM ENV-10 Examination of VP1 of Polyomavirus: Introduction and NMR Studies. S. M. STANCZYK, R. H. MEYERS, J. K. NELSON, AND D. M. PRATHER, Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, FL 33711. The Polyomavirus consists of a super-coiled circular DNA molecule inside a protein shell. This shell is made up of three viral proteins, with one (VP1) Comprising 75% of it. Five VP1 molecules associate to form a "capsomere," 72 of which associate into a "capsid" making up this shell when Ca2+ is added. Self-assembly properties of VP1 were studied in both ground-based trials and in conditions of microgravity. In the latter, the capside shell would not form, possibly due to protein unfolding. This unfolding may have altered the Ca2+ binding portion, or "domain," of VP I so that proper assemby is not possible. The Ca2+ binding domain of VP I is made up of a sequence of 12 amino acids, and this sequence resembles those in Ca2+ binding domains of other proteins. This peptide has been synthesized,</page><page sequence="33">Florida Scientist 22 Volume 60 purified, and has undergone NMR analysis. Two dimensional studies involving the COSY, NOLSY, ROLSY, and TOCSY pulse sequences have been done. The data obtained thus far will be presented.

R. E. NEGRON AND J. mTrOBERT, Department of Chemistry, CHE 305, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL 33620-5250. An analytical method validation was performed for an MECC steroid analysis developed previously in our laboratory. Steroid sample mixtures containing corticosterone, progesterone, testosterone, testosterone acetate, and methyl testosterone were prepared at 30% to 150% of a target concentration (6.5 x 10'5 M each). Steroid migration times ranged from 15 to 22 minutes, and migration time reproducibilities varied from 0 to 5 % RSD. Peak areas varied linearly with concentration over the 90% to 150% range; however, below 90% of the target concentration deviations from linearity were observed. Results will be discussed and additional data presented for samples prepared in a mock biomatrix. 11:00 AM ENV-I 2 "Lactam -inverted" Analogues of the Penem and Clavulanic Acid Antibiotics. M. 1. KONAKLIEVA, H. SHI, AND EDWARD TUROS, Dept. Of Chemistry, Univ. Of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. Our studies on the synthesis of novel ß-lactam ring systems related to the penem and clavulanic acid families of antibiotics will be described. The bicyclic core of the analogues can be easily constructed by a [2 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction between an a, ß - unsaturated imine and an acid chloride followed by a regiospecific halocyclization process, and further derivatized using palladium-catalyzed transformations of a vinyl halide. 11:15AM ENV-13 Cloud-point Extraction of Chromium (III) Ion as Neutral Complexes From Wastewater. CHUHUA WANG AND DEAN F. MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620. A surfactant- mediated extraction, cloud point extraction, was used to replace the conventional liquid-liquid extraction for chromium(lll) ion from aqueous solutions. 8-hydroxy-quinoline, 2-methyl, 8 hydroxy-quinoline, 5-CI- 8-hydroxyquinoline, and Kelex 100 (CM-substituted 8 hydroxy-quinoline) were used as ligands to form chromium complexs. The investigation used pH = 5.5 buffer solutions and initial chromium (III) concentration was 27- 105 ppm. Ligand molar concentration should be more than 3 times as much as that of chromium(III) ion. For small ligands, the reaction reached equilibrium within 2 hours, and the chromium concentration was</page><page sequence="34">1997 Meeting 23 Program Issue reduced to less than 1 ppm. Kelex 100 reacted with chromium(lll) ion very slowly because of the ligand's hydrophobic and steric hindrance. Since hydrated chromium ion, [Cr(H ;0)6]3+, is inert for ligand exchange, the choice of ligands for chromium complex formation is limited. 11:30AM ENV-14 Mechanism of Phosphonic Acid Adsorption Onto Aluminum Oxide. WENDY M. FOSS AND JEROME E. HAKY, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton 33431. Phosphates and phosphonates strongly interact with metal oxides, such as those found in the sediments of freshwater lakes and streams. We report here the results of a laboratory study of the adsorption of phenylphosphonic acid onto the surface of aluminum oxide (alumina) from aqueous solution. It was found that an initial monolayer of the phosphonic acid is strongly bonded to the alumina surface, while additional layers are more weakly adsorbed. Maximum monolayer coverage occurs in the pH range of 3-4, which corresponds to conditions favoring formation of the singly charged phenylphosphonate ion, C6H5P03H'. These results are consistent with a condensation reaction between the phosphonic acid and surface hydroxyl groups on the alumina. The process is enhanced by electrostatic attraction of negatively-charged phosphonate ions to a positively-charged alumina surface. 11:45AM ROOM 202 in Classroom Bldg.

L.A.DOWNEY. New College of USF, 5700 N. Tamiami Trail, Sarasota 34243. The Carrotwood tree, a native of Australia, is commonly planted for landscaping purposes in southern Florida. After escaping cultivation in the 1980s, it quickly established itself on mangrove and spoil islands where it</page><page sequence="35">Florida Scientist 24 Volume 60 thrives under the shade of Australian Pines and among coastal and inland mangroves. The species has recently been added to a Sarasota County ordinance (along with Australian Pine, Brazilian Pepper and Maleluca trees), banning its future sale, transport and propagation. This is the first step in controlling Carrotwood growth. However, a lack of research into the species, particularly in southern Florida, limits the action county officials can take. Therefore, my thesis will focus on baseline scientific experiments that determine Carrotwood density as well as elevation and soil requirements. Two islands will be studied: John Mac Donald island in Robert's Bay- formed completely from spoil; and Otter Key in Sarasota Bay- a natural island onto which spoil was dumped in the 1920s. This data will be used to compare the impact of the exotic species on two islands of different historical and vegetative origins and to develop a plan to eradicate and control the species. 2:15PM ENV-16 Evaluation of Allelopathic Materials Produced by Nannochloris Oculata. E. PEREZ, D. F. MARTIN, AND W. SAWYERS, Institute of Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL 33620. It has been found that the green alga, N. oculata, is allelopathic to Florida's red tide dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium breve . Two of the N. oculata toxins have been identified by GC MS as methyl stearate and methyl palmitate and are being characterized. This on-going research is concerned with evaluating the total effect of these toxins on G. breve , in addition to the factors affecting its growth, biological activity and action mode against G. breve. 2:30PM ENV-17 Relative Concentrations of Allelopathic Materials in Cattail Plants (Typha dominguensis). MARIA T. GALLARDO AND DEAN F. MARTIN. Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4020 E. Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL 33620. 2 chlorophenol and salicylaldehyde are thought to be among the chemical species responsible for the allelopathic behavior of cattails. This research deals with the determination of the concentration and distribution of this compounds in the cattail plants and its release in the surrounding waters in an effort to characterize the observed toxic effect of the cattails over other plant species. 2:45PM ENV-18 Isolation of Allelopathic Substances from Cattails, Typha domingensis, from Hillsborough County. VICKI PRJNDLE, WILLIAM G. SAWYERS, BARBARA B. MARTIN, AND DEAN F.

Cattails from a USF campus pond had been identified as containing allelopathic compounds [Prindle and</page><page sequence="36">1997 Meeting 25 Program Issue Martin, Florida Scient. 59:155-162] on the basis of testing aqueous isolates against lettuce seeds. The extracts were passed through an EXTRA-SEP column , a commercial C-8 chromatography column, then extracted with methanol. The extracts were subject to analysis with GC-MS using a H.P. model 5890 series 11 gas Chromatograph and a computerized H.P. model 5972 mass selective detector. Two known substances, 2-chlorophenol and salicylaldehyde, were identified, based upon comparison with literature spectra. Authentic samples of both were tested against lettuce seeds and found to be allelopathic. 3:00PM ENV-19 The Impact of Tobacco on Nitrate. ROBERT S. BRAMAN (1), MARGARET FARAGO (2) AND IAN THORNTON (2), (1) Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620 (2) Centre for Environmental Technology, Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BP. The nitrate content of tobacco produces nitric oxide in primary tobacco smoke. It has bene demonstrated that nitric oxide produces nitrosoamines when reacting with amino acids having secondary amine nitrogens. This may account for the increased mortality rate among smokers. Analyses of tobacco products for nitrate by country of origin of the tobacco products is strongly correlated with the mortality rate for smokers. 3:15PM ENV-20 The Recycling Index Revisited. BARBARA B. MARTIN AND DEAN F. MARTIN, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620. The Recycling Index was defined previously [Martin and Martin, Florida Scient. 59:65-73] as the ratio of the recycling percentage to the target percentage (30% for Florida,). The Recycling Percentage was defined as being equal to 100R/(R +L + C), where R is the total mass of solid waste recycled, L the amount placed in landfills, and C the mass of solid waste combusted. Affected counties in Florida met the targets set by in the 1988 Florida Solid Waste Act. Now it seems pertinent to review the current status and revisit the question of the usefulness and problems of recycling. For example, how much solid waste might we expect to be produced, and how much land might be consumed for landfills? Is recycling cost-effective? Does recycling contribute to air pollution? 3:30PM ENV-21 Patterns of Water Chemistry and Fish Occurrence in Wetlands of Hydric Pine Flatwoods in Southwestern Florida. W. A. DUNSON (1), C. P. PARADISE (1), AND R. VAN FLEET (2), (1) Dept. of Biology, Penn. State Univ., University Park 16802, (2) Sarasota Cty. Natural Resources, Sarasota,34232. We measured water specific conductance, cations [Na,K,Ca,Mg], and fish species occurrence in wetlands of the Carlton Reserve</page><page sequence="37">Florida Scientist 26 Volume 60 and Myakka Fiatwoods State Forest. Wetlands varied from 20 to &gt;500 |iS/cm, yet they appeared to be a single water type. [Na], [Ca], and [Mg] were strongly positively correlated, but not [K]. Fish species varied with water chemistry and wetland origin (natural vs constructed). We conclude that the softest wetlands are the most isolated; thus monitoring of specific conductance would be a simple way of determining anthropogenic changes in wetland hydrology. 3:45PM ENV-22 Areal Estimates of Sediment Contamination by Trace Metals in Tampa Bay, 1993-1995. S.A. GRABE, T.C. CARDINALE, AND S. PEREZ. Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. 1900 9th Ave. Tampa, FL 33605. Sediment contamination by trace metals (Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Cu. Ni, Pb, and Zn) in four segments of Tampa Bay (Old, Hillsborough, Middle, and Lower Tampa Bay) was estimated an an areal basis. Sampling design was the random, probability-based approach used by the USEPA's "EMAP" program. Contamination was defined by the Threshold Effects (TEL) and Predicted Effects (PEL) levels developed for Florida coastal waters. A total of 234 samples were collected during September-October 1993-1995. Hillsborough Bay, the most industrialized segment, showed greatest extents of contamination: more than 15 km2 of Hillsborough Bay bottom was estimated have Cd, Cu, Ni, and Cr concentration in excess of the TEL. The extent of contamination, both in area and percentage of the segment, was considerably lower in the other bay segments. 4:00PM ENV-23 Natural Fertilization: Is the Clean Air Act Going Too Far? JAY W. PALMER, Institute for Environmental Studies, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., CHE 305, Tampa 33620-5250. The EPA is proposing tough new rules to fight smog. These new rules could significantly improve the health of millions of Americans at a cost of billions of dollars. However, in semi-tropical areas such as Florida, there is concern that these rules might reduce the natural fertilization of wetlands and forested areas, and also increase the rate of global warming. An assessment will be made of these concerns. 4:15PM ENV-24 The Extinction Coefficient for Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in Coastal Waters. G. A. BLANCHARD AND R. C. BROWN, Manatee County Environmental Management Dept., P.O. Box 1000, Bradenton 34206-1000. How the extinction coefficient of PAR (k) varies with respect to other water quality variables became an important issue during the development of management actions for the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program. A procedure was developed to determine a spatially consistent k value from PAR measurements at two, 2-Pi underwater quantum sensors with 0.5m vertical</page><page sequence="38">1997 Meeting 27 Program Issue separation that measured PAR at depths of 1.0m and 1.5m. These k measurements and covariate data on turbidity, color, and chlorophyll from the Manatee County Environmental Management Dept.'s regional water quality monitoring program are examined for relationships between water column transparency and water quality. 4:30PM ENV-25 Characterization of Productivity and Photosynthetic Taxa Using Chlorophyll and Carotenoid Biomarker Studies on the Waters and Sediments of Florida Bay. J.W.LOUDA(l), J.W.LOlTZ(l), E.W.BAKER(l), and D. T. RUDNICK(2). (1) Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, 33431, (2) South Florida Water Management District, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33416. Florida Bay has experienced seagrass and sponge die-oflfs and sporadic algal blooms. The present study targets the chlorophylls and carotenoids as biomarkers with which to study the crude taxonomic (i.e. Divisional) makeup of present and past algal and phototrophic bacterial populations. Further, relationships of pigment abundances in the sediments, as related to bulk organic carbon, are being traced in efforts to unravel the history of Florida bay algal blooms, hopefully extending that history to the pre-Man era. The pigments of the main microalgae in the Florida Bay blooms have been typed and studies reveal their presence in the waters and sediments of the bay. This includes: zeaxanthin and ß-carotene in Svnechococcus eloneatus: chlorophylls cl/-c2, fucoxanthin and 2 characteristic carotenols in Cvclotella choctawatcheeana: and myxoxanthophyll, zeaxanthin, and echinenone in an unidentified spherical picoplankter. All species also contained chlorophyll-a. Studies on the unique lime muds of Florida Bay continue at this writing. 4:45PM ENV-26 Senescence, Death and Early Diagenetic Alterations of Chlorophyll-a in Pure Algal Cultures and Recent Sedimentary Environments. J. LIE, J. ZHENG, E.W. BAKER and J.W.LOUDA. Organic Geochemistry Group, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. The transformations of chlorophylls, especially chlorophyll-a, were investigated using reverse-phase ion-pairing high performance liquid-chromatography coupled to full spectral acquisition via photodiode array detection. RP-HPLC/PDA techniques were standardized against a wide variety of authentic chlorophylls, chlorophyll derivatives, and carotenoids. Unispecific algal, cyanobacterial and photosynthetic bacterial cultures were subdivided, purged with nitrogen, and incubated in the dark and at either at room(24°C) or reffigerator(4°C) temperature for various lengths of time( 1 -4 weeks, several months, 1 -2 years). Most of the studies to date cover the qualitative changes of chlorophyli-a, including species specificity in the formation of the various pheopigments. Recent studies include the quantitation of overall pigment loss, to either identifiable pheopigments or to unknown small non-pigment compounds.</page><page sequence="39">Florida Scientist 28 Volume 60 GEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES FRIDAY 2:00 PM, ROOM 109 in Classroom Bldg.

KELLEY (2), (1) Florida Geological Survey, 903 W. Tennessee St., Tallahassee, Fl 32304, (2) Southwest Florida Water Management District, 2379 Broad St., Brooksville, Fl 33512. The Florida Geological Survey and the Southwest Florida Water Management District have entered into a cooperative effort to generate detailed subsurface geological maps of the southwest Florida region. Over a three-year period, structure contour and isopach maps will be constructed for all regionally identifiable units above and including the top of the Eocene Avon Park Limestone (lithostratigraphic) and the middle confining unit of the Floridan aquifer system (hydrostratigraphic). Control points will be selected utilizing a recently developed G1S database that includes more than 4000 boreholes in the region for which samples (cores or cuttings) and/or geophysical logs exist. A control-point density of one borehole per ten square miles is targeted. Map generation and contouring will be completed using GIS software. Final editing will include structural and stratigraphie interpretation. These maps will be useful for ecosystem management, resource permitting, rules enforcement, conceptual frameworks for ground-water flow models, and baseline geologic and hydrogeologic research. 2:15PM GHY-2 Deep Well Injection in the Charlotte Harbor Vicinity. J. L. HABERFELD, Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 2600 Blair Stone Rd., Tallahassee, 32399. Deep injection wells have been used to dispose of wastewater in Florida since 1963, and in the Charlotte Harbor area since 1986. Six injection sites with a total of seven wells dispose of approximately 4.5 million gallons of wastewater per day. The wells are located at municipal and private utility sites on all sides of the harbor. Wells at four of the sites dispose of secondary treated municipal wastewater; one site disposes of desalination reject water; and one site disposes of treated landfill leachate. The vast majority of injected water (97%) is municipal effluent. Depths of injection zones range from 1100 to 3200 feet. The injection zones are highly permeable, fractured dolomite of Eocene age which contain saline water. Changes in lithology result in the permeable intervals being encountered deeper toward the south. The injection zones are overlain by less permeable limestone and shale. These confining</page><page sequence="40">1997 Meeting 29 Program Issue intervals restrict the wastewater to the injection zones thereby protecting the overlying aquifers. Water quality data from wells completed in overlying aquifers demonstrates the injection process is not affecting usable ground water. 2:30PM GHY-3 A High-resolution Study of Karst Topography in Central Florida with Applications to Sinkhole Hazard. D. WHITMAN (1), AND T. L. GUBBELS (2), (1) Dept. of Geology, Florida International University, Miami, 33199, (2) Hughes Information Technology Systems, Landover, MD 20774. We are utilizing modern techniques of digital elevation model (DEM) construction and analysis to study karst processes and sinkhole hazard at scales ranging from tens of centimeters to hundreds of kilometers. The investigation focuses on a region of relatively high topographic relief to the west of Orlando. Preliminary results include construction of a 30-m-resolution DEM constructed from 5' topographic contours which spans a 30'x30' area centered on Lake Apopka. This data along with coincident geologic and hydrologie data, aerial photography, and satellite imagery are being utilized to characterize spatial features and their relationships to spatial/temporal patterns of sinkhole occurrence. In selected portions of the study area, an airborne pulsed laser topographic mapper was deployed in November, 1995. This data which has a vertical accuracy of &lt; 1 m and a horizontal resolution of- 2 m will be used to produce very high resolution DEMs in selected areas in order to characterize topography at the finest horizontal scales and for the detection of subtle topographic features related to incipient sinkhole formation. 2:45PM GHY-4 Modeling The Hydrodynamics of Karstic Landlocked Lakes. W. L. EVANS III, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 2600 Blairstone Road, Tallahassee, FL 32399-2400. Fluctuations in lake levels are known to involve seepage beneath lakes. Lake level decline due to seepage is governed by the effective-head gradient acting across the lake bottom, the hydraulic conductivity of the lake bottom, and the hypsometry of the lake basin. The conductivity and hypsometry are constant for geologically short periods of time, and the head gradient is determined by the lake level. Thus, as a lake level declines, the hydraulic gradient decreases, and the rate at which the level of a lake declines is a function of its level. After accounting for the effects of potential évapotranspiration (PET) and delayed recharge, fluctuations in lake level should resemble a series of exponential decay curves whose parameters reflect basin hypsometry and lake-bottom conductivity. Hydraulic conductivity estimates of lake sediment cores were used to estimate seepage through the lake bottom by utilizing a weighted average approach. As lake levels and lake area fluctuated, the equivalent areal hydraulic conductivity (K A) varied. A second order polynomial was derived to describe the variation in K A. From the K A estimates, seepage flow (L31'1), and seepage (L t "') through the lake bottom were modeled. Seepage flow, as a primary function of declining lake level, behaved</page><page sequence="41">Florida Scientist 30 Volume 60 exponentially. Seepage, as a function of seepage flow and lake hypsometry declined linearly with declining lake level. Lake PET was estimated from the modeled seepage and is approximately double that of the pan évapotranspiration data which suggests that the modeled PET is more representative of lake transpiration. This model was applied to Lake Jackson near Tallahassee, Florida, a closed lake system formed by karstic processes. 3:00PM GFJY-5 Inferred Rapid Sea-level Changes at the Close of the Last Interglacial: Evidence from the House of Refuge in Martin County. D. W. LOVEJOY, Palm Beach Atlantic College, P. O. Box 24708, West Palm Beach 33416. Coastal notches are cut at or just below low-tide level into indurated limestone by the boring and browsing activities of various organisms in concert with physical conditions such as wave erosion and low tidal range. Along the Florida east coast notched outcrops of the Anastasia Formation, a Late Pleistocene coquinoid limestone, appear from St. Augustine south to Ormond Beach, from Cocoa south to Eau Gallie, and from Stuart south to Boca Raton. At the House of Refuge, which is located near the south end of Hutchinson Island in Martin County, an inferred fossil notch appears at a height of +6m. To incise such a narrow notch, and preserve its original profile, would require a rapid but brief rise in sea-level to notch position, followed by a short crest, and a subsequent fall in sea-level rapid enough to leave the notch profile intact. Cutting of the notch presumably took place during the last interglacial stage. 3:15PM GHY-6 Steinhatchee River Estuary, Taylor and Dixie Counties: a comparison of two sediment digestion methods for normalization of trace metal concentration data. C. A. TRIMBLE (1), J F. DONOGHUE (2), P.C. RAGLAND (2), R. HOENSTINE (1), (I) Florida Geological Survey, 903 W. Tennessee St., Tallahassee 32304, (2) Dept. of Geology, FSU, Tallahassee 32306. The Steinhatchee River is a small relatively pristine bay located on the northwest Florida Gulf of Mexico coast. A baseline study was completed to establish existing conditions in this relatively remote site. Samples collected from 31 locations, representing 4 sedimentary environments, were analyzed for major and trace element content (ICP-AES), texture, cation exchange capacity and total organic matter. Samples were normalized to aluminum concentration, total percent organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and total percent fines (&lt;63mm). Normalization assumes a linear relationship between a naturally occurring metal concentration and a geochemical or sedimentological characteristic. Two ICP extraction methods were evaluated: partial, aqua regia digestion and total, hydrofluoric acid digestion. In most cases data correlations from the aqua regia digestion were as good, or better than those of the hydrofluoric acid digeation method. It was found that aqua regia digestion can</page><page sequence="42">1997 Meeting 31 Program Issue be a valuable tool for researchers, particulary when making preliminary studies within a single watershed. This method can be used to located areas for more intensive studies where HF digestion is preferred. 3:30PM GHY-7 Earth science education and environmental stewardship - a video entitled: "Florida's Geology Unearthed," J.D. ARTHUR, Florida Geological Survey, 903 W. Tennessee St., Tallahassee, Fl 32304. An understanding of Florida's solid earth, such as aquifers, geologic history and framework, energy and mineral resources, and geologic processes and hazards is essential toward effective, holistic environmental education. However, a very limited number of Florida-specific earth-science education materials exist. To address this concern, a video entitled Florida s Geology Unearthed has been produced, along with an accompanying Educator's Guide. The 60 minute classroom video uses a contemporary videographic approach intended for the target 8th- and 9th-grade student audience. A broadcast version for general public education is also available. Goals and objectives of the video include: 1) demonstrate why geology is important regarding infrastructure demands due to Florida's population growth; 2) describe Florida's unique geologic history, how it relates to geologic processes and hazards, and how it has shaped the land surface of present-day Florida; 3) establish the importance of geology to the understanding of Florida's ecosystems; 4) compliment existing education Sunshine State Standards; and 5) instill personal awareness and responsibility for Florida's renewable and non-renewable solid-earth resources. An advisory committee of local environmental educators contributed to improving effectiveness of the video in the classroom. A second advisory committee consisting of licensed professional geologists contributed toward technical accuracy. 3:45PM Video, "Florida's Geology Unearthed," J. D.

MOLDWIN, Dept. of Physics and Space Sciences, Florida Institute ofTechnology, Melbourne, FL 32901. A study was conducted on data taken from a winter storm over K.SC using a modified version of the Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) system. This system allowed a user to find up to 12 spatially separate sources in one 200 microsecond record. The distribution of source altitudes for our study showed two peaks at five and 10 km. The pulses studied here had rise times of less than one micros., and then fell of to a shouldeer of half the intensity. The total signal length was about three micros. The velocity distribution was from 5 x 106 to 2 x 108 m/s with a peak around 107 m/s. This peak shape, duration, and velocities matched the description of the characteristics of pulses that had been identified with recoil streamers in earlier studies. A plate antenna was used to measure the time change of the electric field. 95.1% of events identified as recoil streamers had associated E field changes, many with large scale changes, indicating an association between recoil streamers and K changes. 8:45AM PSS-2 Ship Propulsion by Wind and Water Turbines. J. NORWOOD, JR., Department of Natural Sciences, University of North Florida, Jacksonville 32224. Wind and water turbine propulsion for ships offers the theoretical possibility to sail directly into the wind, and to sail downwind at speeds greater than wind speed. Force and power equations are derived for generic mills and propellers. These are used to analyze four different modes of propulsion for ships and yachts with a range of realistic hull resistances and parasitic air drags. The ratio of ship speed to true wind speed is calculated for all course angles for each of the four propulsion modes along with the optimized propeller and mill pitch parameters. The conditions under which sailing directly to windward and sailing downwind faster than the wind are possible is clearly delineated. 9:00AM PSS-3 Surface and Bulk Electronic States of a Metallic Solid.* L.R. MASLIAH, Department of Physics, Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Road, Boca Raton, FL 33431. Many physical properties of the surface of a metallic solid</page><page sequence="44">1997 Meeting 33 Program Issue differ from those in its bulk region. Examples include differences in electronic structure, the arrangement of atoms and in the case of alloys, the relative amounts of each species. This paper focuses on an analysis of differences in the electronic structures of the surface and bulk regions of copper and copper-gold alloys. We will demonstrate how both the total energy and the electron core level energies of an isolated copper atom differ from those of a copper atom inside a solid. Using a first-principles approach, we will compare calculated core-level energies of copper atoms in the bulk with those of atoms in the first few layers at the surface. We will show how the electronic states at the surface of a copper-gold alloy differ when a single species is present from thehere both species are present. * Supported by the NSF (DMR-9500654) and NATO 9:15AM PSS-4 Electrodeposited CdS Thin Film Solar Cell Windows. H. FORSELL, J. G. MANTOVAN1, R. P. RAFFAELLE, Florida Institute of Technology, Dept. Physics and Space Sciences, O. MELENDEZ AND J. HURLEY, NASA-Kennedy Space Center, Materials Science Division. We have been investigating the electrochemical deposition of semiconducting cadmium sulfide (CdS). CdS is used as a window material in CulnSe, (CIS) thin film photovoltaic solar cells. We have demonstrated the ability to potentiostatically deposit stoichiometrically correct thin films of CdS from a single plating bath at room temperature. It has been shown that, by the fabrication technique used, it is possible to vary the Cd to S ratio for optimal electrical characteristics. This has been illustrated by periodically varying the Cd to S ratio in a multilayer structure. We have used x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterize our CdS thin films. We will present estimates of the optical bandgaps of our CdS films as determined by room temperature optical absorption measurements. Current versus voltage behavior will be presented for various heterojunctions involving our electrodeposited CdS thin films. 9:30AM PSS-5 Electrodeposited CuInSe2 Thin FilmSolar Cell Materials. D.

K. RAYMOND, K. THOMPSON, AND H. HICKMAN, Hillsborough Community College, P. O. Box 30030, Tampa, Fl, 33630. General relativity predicts that a stationary rod placed parallel to a gravitational field will experience length contraction, while a stationary rod placed perpendicular to the same field will not. If this prediction is true, then a charged parallel plate capacitor should contain less electric energy when its plates are oriented perpendicular to the field than it contains when its plates are oriented parallel to the field. Einstein's famous E = mc2 allows an "equivalent" mass to be associated with any amount of energy. If that equation can be applied to electrical energy, then our capacitor should contain the least amount of mass when its plates are oriented perpendicular to the field. A charged parallel plate capacitor then, should weight less when its plates are oriented perpendicular to a gravitational field than it weights when its plates are oriented parallel to the same field. 10:00 AM BREAK 10:15AM PSS-7 A Single Pulse Solution of the Wave Equation. T. NGUYEN, L. NGO, AND H. HICKMAN, Hillsborough Community College, P. O. Box 30030, Tampa, Fl 33630. The most frequently encountered solution to d'Alemberf s wave equation is a mathematical description of the form f(x, t) = A sin (kx-wt). This expression describes a sine wave moving to the right with velocity v = w/k when t is greater than zero. Unfortunately, the wave already stretches from x = to x = +°° when t = 0. (Real physical waves do not begin by filling all of space.) Multiplication of f (x, t) by a composite Heavyside unit step results in g (x, t) = A [U (x + X/2 - vt) - U (x- A./2 -vt)] sin (kx - cat). This new expression satisfies d'Alembert's equation and describes a "single pulse" sine wave that is only one wave length long. At t = 0 the pulse is centered at the origin, and for t &gt; 0 the pulse moves to the right with velocity v = o&gt;/k . Applications might include quantum mechanics as well as wave interference phenomena. 10:30AM PSS-8 Suprathermal Electron Pitch Angle Distributions observed from Geosynchronous Orbit. P. PARR1SH, H. RASSOUL, AND M. B. MOLDWIN, Dept. Of Physics and space Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL 32901. Plasma data from the Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellite 1989-046 were surveyed to determine the variability of the pitch angle distributions (PADs) of the suprathermal electron populations. Suprathermal electrons are generated by the photoionization of the ionosphere and by field</page><page sequence="46">1997 Meeting 35 Program Issue aligned currents. Understanding the dynamics of the PADs as a function of geomagnetic activity and local time are important for modeling plasmaspheric refilling. This paper will present the results from a six-month study. 10:45 AM PSS-9 ALEXIS Attitude Solution Optimization. P. FELKJER (1,2), J. BLOCH (2), AND J.

University Blvd., Melbourne 32901, (2) Los Alamos National Laboratory, Astrophysics &amp; Radiation Measurements Group, P.O. Box 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545. Overview of an effort to improve the attitude solution for the Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors (ALEXIS) satellite. The spacecraft was damaged during launch and consequently requires substantial computer modeling to predict orientation. Efforts were made to diagnose and eliminate small but significant errors in the computer generated attitude solution.

B. MOLDWIN, AND H. RASSOUL, Dept. of Physics and Space Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL 32901. Plasma data from the Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellite 1989-046 were surveyed for intervals when the high energy electron plasmasheet was observed simultaneously with the low energy ion plasmasphere. To first order these regions of the inner magnetosphere do not overlap due to the different drift paths that these plasma regimes generally are found. However, during times of rapid reconfigurations of the Earth's magnetic field, these two plasma regimes occationally can be observed simultaneously. This study describes the characteristics of when the overlap occurs as a function of local time, geomagnetic activity, and substorm phase. 11:15 AM PSS 11 Ranges of Monotone Operators in Banach Spaces. A. G. KARTSATOS, Department of Mathematics, University of South Florida, Tampa 33620-5700. We study the existence of zeros and other range properties of maximal monotone or demicontinuous monotone operators mapping subsets of a Banach space into its dual space. In particular, we show that the existence of a zero of a maximal monotone operator is equivalent to a certain asymptotic behavior of its resolvents or its Yosida resolvents. Another result is given which shows that the existence of a zero of a demicontinuous monotone operator T in an open set G is equivalent to the operator T satisfying a Leray-Schauder-type condition on the boundary of G. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions for a pathwise connected set to lie in the range of a maximal monotone operator. Finally, we show that NirenbergjCs problem has an affirmative answer if the operator T in question has a monotone-type property. Namely, an operator T mapping a Hilbert space H into itself is surjective if it is continuous, expansive and</page><page sequence="47">Florida Scientist 36 Volume 60 T+ql is monotone, where q is a positive constant in [0,1) and I is the identity operator on H. 11:30 AM , ROOM 204 in Classroom Bldg.

Attempts to physically relocate bats from buildings to bat houses have met with limited success. Most successful attempts involve bat houses placed directly on the building that housed the original roost. Two experiments in central Florida have added optimism to the problem of removing bats from buildings. In one experiment a mixed colony of Tadarida brasiliensis cynocephala and Nycticeius humeralis were evicted from a community college in Sanford, FL, and relocated to a set of bat houses % mile from the original roost. The other experiment involved moving a bat house, occupied by a maternity colony of both species, 5 miles from the original site. Methods involved, results, and thoughts for future work will be discussed. 2:30PM REB-2 A Study of the Endangered Yellow-Apple Cactus, Cereus gracilis var. aboriginum, Longboat Key, Florida. JESSA FISHER, New College, Environmental Studies Program, 5700 North Tamiami Trail, Sarasota 34243. The habitat of this cactus is described, including an in-depth assessment of surrounding flora, with special attention to the dominant tree species, southern red cedar, Juniperus silicicola. Blooming and fruiting times are recorded, and all species are identified and mounted. A detailed map of the 4.5 acre hammock describes the area and shows exact locations of all Cereus individuals. Each cactus is measured, tagged, and any insect/animal-plant interactions are noted, particularly concerning pollination and dispersal of seeds. The evolutionary history of the cactus is discussed, comparing it with other members of the genus. The delicate relationships between cactus and cedar and other plant members of the habitat are reflected upon and analyzed. The paper concludes with a recommendation for the continued existence and well-being of this cactus.</page><page sequence="48">1997 Meeting 37 Program Issue 2:45PM REB-3 Habitat Specificity of the Hand Fem Ophioglossum palmaium L.

ROBIN B. HUCK AND PAMELA MURPHY, Dept. of Environmental Protection, Panama City 32408. A diverse landscape of interdunal lakes, beach-dunes, pine flatwoods, sand pine scrub, sandhills, blackwater streams and depressional ponds are habitats for a diverse flora in coastal panhandle Florida in Walton County. Nearly 250 species of vascular plants, some rare and endemic, were collected and identified in a recent inventory of these new State lands. Ecotonal areas surrounding cypress domes are occupied by, among others, insectivorous plants, and Curtiss' sandgrass (Calamovilfa curtissif). Growth habit of the latter is similar to the cutthroat grass (Panicum abscissum) seeps in central Florida. Tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) was discovered on the edge of the blackwater streams. A radiation of species in genera such as Rhexia, Rhynchospora, Chrysopsis, Polygonella and Polygala is found here. 3:15PM REB-5 Wildlife Management. I. M.

ZAMBRANO, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, 551 N. Military Trail, West Palm Beach 33415. Six counties in southeast Florida were surveyed for nesting least tems (Sterna antillarum). Previously documented sites in our Wildlife Occurrences Database were reexamined, and new sites obtained from other wildlife agencies and organizations were also surveyed. We estimated a minimum of 1,437 breeding pairs in 29 active colonies. However, the majority (93%) of the active colonies found were gravel and tar roof-top sites, the rest were ground nesting colonies. The shift from ground nesting sites to roofs is probably a direct result of intense beach front development and human recreational activities in this highly urbanized area. Colony turnover was also very high. Sixty-five percent of previously documented sites (n=26) were no longer active and 20 new sites were found. Construction, human disturbance, and roof repairs were suspected causes of abandonment of some of these colonies. Black skimmers (Rynchops niger), a Species of Special Concern, were also found nesting on 6 of the least tern roof colonies. 4:00 PM, R OOM 204 in Classroom Bldg.

The 1996 Florida Biodiversity Research Project, funded by the Governor's Summer Program and BCC, was was a 14-day program designed to encourage an understanding of the importance and complexity of Florida's biodiversity and the responsibiltiy of humans to establish an environmental ethic in its regard. Outstanding high school students performed college-level research and analysis while participating in interest-generating outdoor activities in local forests and streams. Topics included techniques in ecological biodiversity studies, including survey design, sampling methods, lab analysis of water, soil, bacteria, and plankton, light and electron microscope techniques, and data recording, retrieval, and interpretation. Perspectives on environmental planning were explored based on local wastewater treatment renovations and county land planning activities. Representative from the University of Central Florida, the Brevard County Environmentally Endangered Lands Program, the Enchanted Forest Sanctuary, and Tosohatchee State Reserve were key participants. 9:45AM TCH-4 Supplemental Instruction and Its Impact on Participating Freshman Biology Students. C. N. DUNSTAN AND E. T. HAYS, SNHS, Barry University, 11300 NE Second Ave., Miami 33161. In recent years student retention levels have become a major concern for colleges and universities nationwide. As a result of many years of analysis, the SNHS at Barry University has identified the two most important factors affecting its student retention levels. The crucial determinants include the student's first semester cumulative GPA and</page><page sequence="51">Florida Scientist 40 Volume 60 the student's success in their first semester biology course. One response of the SNHS to reduce attrition levels has been to institute supplemental instruction (SI). The aim of SI is to enhance the comprehension level of and familiarity with course work taught in the first semester biology course. A summary of the instructors experiences along with student feedback will be presented. Student evaluations of the program suggest that SI was beneficial and recommend that SI be continued in freshman and more advanced courses. 10:AM BREAK 10:15 AM TCH-5 Predictors of Success in Undergraduate Biology. E.T. HAYS AND J.M. MONTAGUE, SNHS, Barry University, 11300 NE Second Avenue, Miami 33161. What are the factors that best predict early success and retention of undergraduate biology majors at a small university with a very diverse student population? Whereas Group Assessment of Learning Techniques (GALT) scores were found to be unreliable, high school GPA's, math and verbal SAT's, and National Association of Biology Teachers exam scores had more reliable predictive value both for academic success in the first year of college as well as in the retention of the students. On the basis of these predictors, support programs can be developed to enhance both the academic performance and retention of at risk students. 10:30AM TCH-6 Muscles of the Hip: An Interactive Module for Use in Anatomy Classes.

CRON1N, Saint Leo College, St Leo 33574. Two studies evaluated the efficacy of "explicit priming" for reducing alcohol-related problems among college students during discreet, high risk periods. The "explicit priming" task involved asking students to predict the type and frequency of alcohol-related problems they expected to experience during the upcoming high risk period. The first study used 110 university students (53 males and 57 females) at a university in South Australia. The second study used 236 college students enrolled at two liberal arts colleges in Kentucky and Florida. Both studies demonstrated a significant reduction in alcohol-related problems among students who were explicitly primed prior to the high risk period. 2:30 PM SOC-2 Expectations of the Elderly Regarding Counseling. C.M. CIANC1, Saint Leo College, St. Leo 33574. The present study looked at elderly person's expectations regarding counseling. Previous research has suggested that elderly individuals are resistant to counseling. Seventy-eight individuals between the ages of 55 and 75 completed the 73 item Expectations About Counseling -Brief Form (EAC-B) questionnaire.

SUSAN KINSELLA, Dept. Of Social Work, P.O. Box 6665, Saint Leo College, St. Leo 33574. Nontraditional College Students have been the focus of several recent investigations. Defined as over 24 years of age or returning to school after a break in their education (Hirschom, 1988), nontraditional students make up almost half of the undergraduate students enrolled in college today. Nontraditional students are often married, work, and , have childrenso returning to school means making a significant life change ' (Harouff, 1996). Many schools are now beginning to address the needs of the nontraditional studentby offering special adult student services and nontraditional I student associations (Boben, 1996). In this recent comparative study, students on ; one Florida campus were examined to determine what disciplines nontraditional students were selecting. A comparison of traditional and nontraditional students ! was made regarding age, gender, marital status, enrollment status, number of dependents, and types of responsibilities held outside of the educational environment. Implications for student support services and student adjustment are discussed. 3:OOPMSOC-4 The Role of Stimulus Comparison in an Olfactory Classical Conditioning Discrimination Task in Neonatal Rats. R. G. BRYAN, Dept. of Psychology, Saint Leo College, St. Leo, FL 33574. Young rats exposed to an odor (CS+) paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) do not easily form an association unless they are exposed to a second odor (CS-) paired with absence of the US. The "stimulus selection" explanation of this "CS- Effect" is that shifts from CS- to CS+ calls attention to the CS+ facilitating learning the CS+- US association. One hundred-sixty 7 to 8 day old albino rats were exposed to one odor (CS+) with a sibling (US) and a second odor (CS-) without the US. As predicted by the "stimulus selection" hypothesis animals exposed to CS- before CS+ learned better than those presented with CS- after CS+. A one-minute separation between CS presentations did not disrupt learning as would be predicted. Longer separations may be required to produce measurable disruption. 3:15 PM SOC-5 A Survey of the Homeless Population in Pasco County. D. McILVAINE, 5836 10th Ave. New Port Richey 34652. "... Experts have been unable to agree on how many homeless people there are and on whether or not the total is rising. Estimates range from a few hundred thousand to as many as several million. Lack of consensus on this basic policy issue is understandable; individuals and families without a permanent address are often hard to find." (Worsnop, Richard L. 1996., Helping the Homeless.

The unique</page><page sequence="55">Florida Scientist 44 Volume 60 problems related to identifying the homeless population in Pasco County along with implementing an accurate survey is examined.

Richard March, South Florida Water Management District, Presiding 2:15PM URP-1 Funding Water Supply and Environmental Restoration and Enhancement Programs in the South Florida Water Management District. JANE KIRKER BUCCA and RICHARD A. MARCH, South Florida Water Management District. Recent legislation has expanded the range of water supply and environmental enhancement projects which the South Florida Water Management District is obligated to undertake. The District is limited both statutorily and constitutionally in the millage rate which it can charge. In this paper alternative funding sources are identified, the revenue generating potential of each source is examined, and pluses and minuses are identified. Opportunities and potential pitfalls of cost-sharing arrangements with other public (and private) entities will be discussed. The examples presented in this paper will be extrapolated to other agencies of the state, and conclusions will be drawn regarding funding of public services in an era of scarce public funds. 2:30PM URP-2 Roles and perceptions of planning professionals in a resource management agency. SUSAN A. MASON and RICHARD A. MARCH, South Florida Water Management District. In this paper, the role of planners in the South Florida Water Management District will be examined. Implications of having planners dispersed to multi-disciplinary organizational units will be discussed. Problems facing planning professionals in defining and communicating their role in what has traditionally been an engineering and natural science-oriented agency will be discussed. Implications will be drawn as to how planners can more effectively function in a multi-disciplinary resource management agency.</page><page sequence="56">1997 Meeting 45 Program Issue 2:45PM URP-3 ARIMA forecasting of Public Water Supply Pumpages for the counties and planning areas of the South Florida Water Management District. RICHARD L. MARELLA, U. S. Geological Survey, Tallahassee, Florida and RICHARD A. MARCH, South Florida Water Management District. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average modeling is used to forecast county level public water supply pumpages in the sixteen counties wholly or partially in the South Florida Water Management District. These pumpages will be aggregated for the four major planning areas of the District (Upper East Coast, Lower East Coast, Lower West Coast and Kissimmee areas) and the results for the four areas compared. These projections will be compared to otherr planning projections from Water Management District Water Supply Plans and local government comprehensive plans. 3:00PM, ROOM 102 SECTION MEETING: URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING Richard March, South Florida Water Management District, Presiding NOTES</page><page sequence="57">Florida Scientist 46 Volume 60 AUTHOR INDEX NAME.
