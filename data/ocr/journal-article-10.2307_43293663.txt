"Jane Barker and Her Life ( 1 652- 1 732): The Documentary Record." ECLife 21 (1997): 16-38. Offers an extended, archivally based account of Barker's life and maintains that past accounts which rely heavily on Barker's own writings, espe- cially the three apparently autobiographi- cal Galesia fictions (1713-26), have dis- torted scholars' understanding of her life and novels. Presents biographical informa- tion drawn from local archives, a Chan- cery case in 1717, two letters written by Barker, and the Magdalen Manuscript, a volume of original verse produced by Barker while in exile at St. Germain at the turn of the century. Also discusses Barker's attempts to obtain patronage at the court of James II. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Behn and Manley.

"Unguarded Hearts: Trans- gression and Epistolary Form in Aphra Behn's Love-Letters and the Portuguese Letters!' JEGP 97 (1998): 13-33. Exam- ines Sir Roger L'Estrange's Five Love-Let- ters from a Nun to a Cavalieri 1678) and Aphra Behn's Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister to argue that these works "pay tribute to the trasgressive power of eros, as embodied in their female protagonists." Maintains that these protago- nists "all embody the conviction that women are morally superior to men be- cause of their capacity for emotion." Also analyzes the formal characteristics of epis- tolary fiction and summarizes the histori- cal basis for Behn's Love-Letters . Figures mentioned or discussed include Manley, James II, Monmouth, and Rochester. Ferguson, Margaret. 'The Authorial Ciphers of Aphra Behn." See BIBLIOGRAPHIES (Zwicker), 225-49. Examines the ways in which Behn creates herself as a "cipher," or enigma, and the social and aesthetic rea- sons for her fashioning of herself in this way. Argues that Behn participated in a "Renaissance" of the ancient art of ciphers, "albeit from a necessarily eccentric sub- ject position and in ways that have been little remarked." Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Defoe, Dryden, Rochester, and Winchilsea. Labio, Catherine. "'What's in Fashion Vent': Behn, La Fayette, and the Market for Nov- els and Novelty." Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 28 (1998): 1 19-39. Focuses on Behn's prose fiction of the 1 680s and on the promotion and reception of La Princesse de Cleves in the 1670s to argue that Behn's and La Fayette's com- parable attempts to fulfill as well as to fash- ion the demand for literary novelty reveal not only their willingness to respond to the respective market forces at play in dissemi- nating their work, but also the relative unimportance of authors' individual situa- tions in the economies of genre formation. Also briefly discusses Jacob Tonson's and Thomas Southerne's reactions to Behn's move from penning dramas to writing fic- tional narratives. Pacheco, Anita. "Rape and the Female Sub- ject in Aphra Behn's The Roveri ELH 65 ( 1 998): 323-45. Examines the role that rape plays in Florinda and Angellica Bianca's struggles to escape patriarchal devaluation. Argues that rape in these characters' expe- riences works to question and problematize female subjectivity within a patriarchal world in which the psychology of rape is endemic. Contends that this world mea- sures masculinity by the capacity to exer- cise power over and through women, a depiction that causes generic problems for Behn's play. Briefly discusses works by Astell and Thomas Killigrew. Payne, Linda R. 'The Carni valesque Regen- eration of Corrupt Economies in The Rover ." Restoration 22.1 (1998): 40-49. Argues that The Rover reveals both the in- adequacy of the "comic ethos" of Restora- tion satirical structure, subverting the styl- ized culture of the English drawing room, and similar disjunctures of Restoration so- ciety, particularly the male aristocratic economy. Contends that the play's carnivalesque elements allow the female characters to reject their assigned roles within patriarchal culture and to determine their own romantic fates, but also compli- cate these fates since the cavaliers, as colo- nizers, cannot read the female characters' new sign system. Concludes that Behn only partially resolves the tensions between these two ideologies. Briefly discusses some of Behn's changes in adapting Tho- mas Killigrew's Thomaso, or The Wan- derer. Rivero, Albert J. "'Hieroglifick'd' History in Aphra Behn's Love-Letters Between a 98</page><page sequence="3">Nobleman and His Sister ." SNNTS 30 (1998): 126-38. Focuses on Behn's repre- sentation of the failure of the Monmouth rebellion in 1685 to argue that Behn helps to originate the novel's use of political re- ality as the basis for fictional narratives. Contends that she uses an allegorical nar- rative of history similar to Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel to reveal her sup- port for the royalist cause. Maintains that, although Behn probably wrote the first volume of Love-Letters as a way to "cash in" on Lord Grey's much publicized scan- dals, her work became a more self-con- scious history depicting the providentially ordained downfall of a foolish prince. Fig- ures mentioned or discussed include Charles II, James II, Manley, and Monmouth. Simms, Norman. "A Dark Cynical Conceit: The Masque in Aphra Behn's The Lucky Chancer AUMLA 88 (1997): 83-95. Main- tains that Behn's play shows a "tenuous insertion of compromised romantic and heroic posturing into a society predicated upon the middle-class trinity of cash-nexus, commodity-fetishism, and individual greed." Suggests that Behn's characters come close to the stock figures of Restora- tion comedy but then retreat into the "shad- ows and illusions of a series of masques and conceits." Concludes that in this play imagination is the "cynical instrument of love" and that it subverts the authority of bourgeois ideology. Stewart, Ann Marie. "Rape, Patriarchy, and the Libertine Ethos: The Function of Sexual Violence in Aphra Behn's The Golden Age' and The Rover, Part I ." RECTR 1 2.2 (1997): 26-39. Argues that in The Rover men attempt to rape women to curb the possibility that women have power to act out against male authority. Suggests that, since all three instances of attempted rape are thwarted, in the context of the play "rape does not represent a violation on a defenseless female body, rather it signifies the capacity for women to usurp male au- thority." Connects Behn's depiction of rape to libertinism, arguing that libertines' dis- ruption of traditional gender roles threat- ened patriarchal authority. Figures men- tioned or discussed include Charles II, Dry- den, Etherege, Shadwell, Steele, and Wycherley. Thomas, Susie. "'This Thing of Darkness I Acknowledge Mine': Aphra Behn's Abdelazer, or, The Moor's Revenge ." Res- toration 22. 1 ( 1 998): 1 8-39. Contends that this drama presents an ambiguous depic- tion of Africans, one that hovers between representations of Moors either as sympa- thetic, dignified heroes or as monstrous devils. Claims that this ambiguity results from Behn's attempt to transform the vil- lainous Moor, Eleazar, she found in Lust's Dominion, or, The Lascivious Queen into the heroic figure of a royal slave and that her adaptation reveals a consistent effort to minimize the racism of her source. Also demonstrates that Behn's play was the source for Edward Young's The Revenge (1721). Briefly compares Behn's hero to Dryden's Almanzor in The Conquest of Granada.

"Anne Bradstreet and Performativity: Self-Culti- vation, Self-Deployment." EAL 32.3 (1998): 222-48. Maintains that, in response to the strictures of her day, "Bradstreet cul- tivates her identity through multiple mo- dalities of self, in a manner both deliberate and intricate." Analyzes Bradstreet's quaternions to argue that these poems "en- able her to examine the possibilities of performativity for self-assertion, particu- larly in the context of patriarchy." Con- cludes that Puritan faith is not essential to Bradstreet's identity, that she turns to reli- gion in part "for relief from mutability."

John Bunyan in Context. Pittsburgh: Duquesne UP, 1997. Studies Bunyan's life and work in several contexts: his links with medieval and popular cul- ture and piety; the quest for balance in his work between a trust in divine grace and a quest for personal merit; and his compara- bility to such figures as Luther, Calvin, Fox, Baxter, Donne, and Herbert. Also exam- ines Bunyan's ecclesiology, his attitude to the position of women within the church, and his political views. Figures mentioned or discussed include Baxter, Bunyan, Bur- net, Charles II, Clarendon, Danby, Defoe, Dryden, Evelyn, Fox, Hale, James II, L'Estrange, Locke, Milton, Monmouth, Oates, Penn, Pepys, Sancroft, Shaftesbury, Jeremy Taylor, Vaughan, and William III. 320 pp. with index. Spargo, Tamsin. The Writing of John Bunyan . Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997. "Investigates the intersection of political and cultural au- thorities and the forces which have shaped currently dominant understandings of sub- jectivity" through a "textual analysis of specific instances of the operations of power in the production, reception, and dissemination of Bunyan's writings." Ex- amines the use of the name "John Bunyan" to analyze "the discursive techniques which produced the figure of this author, both in the seventeenth century and later, and to identify the different meanings which have been ascribed to it in the history of its pro- duction." Figures mentioned or discussed include Sir William Davenant, Dryden, Filmer, Fox, Hobbes, and Milton. 161 pp. with index. S wann, Charles. "Mark Rutherford's Am- biguous Deliverance: Bunyan, Defoe, Spinoza, and Secular History." RES n.s. 49.193 (1998): 23-39. Concentrates on the meanings of "deliverance" in William Hale White's Mark Rutherford's Deliverance . . . Edited By His Friend, Rupert Shepcott ( 1 885). Argues that the word has "complex and ambiguous meanings-legal, theologi- cal, philosophical . . . politically radical." Contends that, as a one-time independent Calvinist, translator of Spinoza, and politi- cal journalist, White was in an excellent position to juxtapose and contrast Bunyan's and Spinoza's moral vocabularies to ex- plain the ambiguity and history of "deliv- erance." Also examines Defoe's use of this term since Rutherford's work is often com- pared to Defoe's.

"Gilbert Burnet, Tolerance, and the Fathers of the Church." Anglican and Episcopal History 67. 1 ( 1 998): 26-49. 100</page><page sequence="5">Examines the patristic roots for Burnet's strategy of forbearance in his commentary on article seventeen of the Thirty-nine Ar- ticles of the Anglican Church, which ad- dresses predestination. Argues that Burnet should be acquitted of the charge of im- porting the principle of tolerance for "the political purpose of watering down Chris- tianity for the sake of peace." Calls on all Christians to exercise tolerance with re- spect to particular theological opinions. Figures mentioned or discussed include Moore, More, Smith, Stillingfleet, and Whichcote. Greig, Martin. "Gilbert Burnet and the Prob- lem of Nonconformity in Restoration Scot- land and England." CJH 32 (1997): 1-24. Argues that to characterize Bumet as an "advocate of toleration," his reputation among biographers and the general pub- lic, is misleading. Contends that Burnet believed that the only way to secure Chris- tian unity was to create a national church in both England and Scotland that could command conformity in all aspects of re- ligious belief. Traces Burnet's commitment to religious comprehension from his early career as a parish minister in Scotland through his tenure as Bishop of Salisbury with extensive discussion of Charles II's attempts at indulgence and of the Tolera- tion Act of 1 689. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Hale, James II, Mary II, Moore, Sancroft, Stillingfleet, and William III.

Draws upon Locke's examination of reason to explain the con- ventions of the rogue tale. Dharwadker, Apama. "Nation, Race, and the Ideology of Commerce in Defoe." ECent 39 (1998): 63-84. Argues that there is a particularly complex tension between mili- tant and benevolent conceptions of com- merce in Defoe's writing since his mercan- tilist positions are mediated by the quasi- imperial discourses of nation and race. Briefly discusses Behn's and Southerne's versions of Orvonoko. Diyen, Hayat. 'The Narrativity of Jonathan Wild in Defoe's Account of Jonathan Wild and Fielding's The Life of Jonathan Wild the Great!'

REN 49 (1997): 95- 110. Contends that Defoe's Robinson Crusoe reflects a period of transition in biblical hermeneutics by incorporating two kinds of biblical reading, one that saw scripture as literal, historical, and edifying and one that separated the "edifying" meanings of the Bible from historical fic- tions. Figures mentioned or discussed in- clude Collins and Gildon. Sill, Geoffrey. "The Source of Robinson Crusoe's 'Sudden Joys.'" N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 67-68. Notes that Crusoe's quota- tion can be found in a broadsheet by Rob- ert Wild (1609-79) entitled "Wild's Humble Thanks for his Majesties Gracious Declaration of Liberty of Conscience, March 15, 1672." Wall, Cynthia. "Novel Streets: The Rebuild- ing of London and Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year." SNNTS 30 (1998): 164- 77. Argues that this work responds with generic innovation to the changed bound- aries and significance of London's urban spaces after the Great Fire of 1666, using fictional narrative to redefine and imagi- natively reoccupy the new streets of the city.

"Amendments to the Ma- gna Carta: Genre and Dry den's Aeneis ." ECent 39 (1998): 44-62. Demonstrates how Dryden's Aeneis both illuminates the demise of the heroic and is itself an ex- ample of what replaced it. Argues that the Aeneis is a product of a decade of cultural transition and not simply the result of Dryden's own bitterness and disillusion- ment. Figures mentioned or discussed in- clude Congreve, James II, Kneller, and William III. Dryden, John. Virgil's Aeneid, Translated by John Dryden. Ed. Frederick M. Keener. London: Penguin, 1997. Based on the sec- ond edition of Dryden's translation ( 1 698), this volume includes an instructive, 36- page "preface," some suggestions for fur- ther reading, a list of emendations, a glos- sary that performs many of the functions of explanatory notes, and maps to help the reader locate the warfare and travels re- ferred to by Virgil, xliv+423 pp. (JMA) Gardiner, Anne Barbeau. Ancient Faith and Modern Freedom in John Dryden's The Hind and the Panther. Washington, D.C.: Catholic U of America P 1 998. Argues that Dryden's poem was a unified defense of faith and a plea for religious freedom. Maintains that Solomon's Canticles of Canticles was the source for Dryden's de- sign and contends that Dryden's poem par- ticipated in the campaign to repeal the Test Act against Catholics and Dissenters. Fig- ures mentioned or discussed include Andros, Baxter, Buckingham, Burnet, Charles II, Collins, Etherege, Evelyn, Fuller, Hale, Halifax, Harrington, James II, L'Estrange, Locke, Mary II, Milton, Monmouth, More, North, Oates, Parker, Penn, Pepys, Sancroft, Shaftesbury, Sharp, Stillingfleet, Jeremy Taylor, William III, and Wood. 266 pp. with index.

RECTR 12.2 (1997): 61-67. Explicates Dryden's prologue for a revival of Tho- mas Tomkis' university comedy Albumazar (1614). Contends that Dryden laments a lost ethic of decorum and pro- fessionalism. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Howard and Buckingham. Scala, Alexander. "A Smock Alley Promptbook for Tyrannick Love ." TN 52 (1998): 65-90. Describes a previously un- known promptbook for a Dublin perfor- mance. Maintains that this is the first record of any Dublin performance of this play. Reconstructs and analyzes the manuscript's cast list, identifying the com- plete names of several of the partially- named actors. Also transcribes the notes from the promptbook, suggesting ways in which the Smock Alley company staged the play. Zwicker, Steven N. "John Dryden." See BIB- LIOGRAPHIES (Zwicker), 185-203. Re- views Dryden's literary career from the pub- lication of his first poem, an elegy for Lord Hastings in 1 649, to his last work, The Secu- lar Masque in 1700. Claims that Dryden's work is "an incomparable achievement" that defines Restoration literature. Includes sug- gestions for further reading.

Identifies several "semi-concealed figures" mentioned by Dunton in The Living Elegy: or, Dunton s Letter to his Few Creditors , which accuses his former publisher Sarah Malthus of hir- ing "Anonymous Rakes" to "blast my credit" after he hired a new publisher. These figures include Dowley, a book-binder; Bryan Mills, a publisher; John Hall; and John Wine. Briefly describes Wine's ex- tant works. GEORGE ETHEREGE Kachur, B.A. "Etherege's She Would If She Could : Rereading the Libertines." RECTR 12.2 (1997): 40-60. Analyzes Etherege's depiction of libertinism in She Would If She Could to argue that Courtall and Freeman are incapable of distinguishing between appearance and reality and therefore differ from Etherege's later libertine characters. Contends that this lack of awareness allies them with Restoration comic dupes and cullies rather than with rake-heroes. Con- cludes that each of these characters' choice to marry sustains and validates male privi- lege; their marriages are part of "a moral imperative set down by men to ensure the status quo of patriarchy and male sexual politics."

Overhoff, Jüngen. "The Lutheranism of Tho- mas Hobbes." History of Political Thought 18 (1997): 604-23. Surveys Hobbes's use of Martin Luther's theology to argue that most of Hobbes's theological ideas corre- spond to Luther's own doctrines. Notes that there was one major exception to this con- gruity: "Hobbes took no heed whatsoever of Luther's spiritualism," relying instead on a knowledge of second causes. Con- cludes that Hobbes's Lutheranism was "a recognizable and, above all, credible sev- enteenth-century theological defense of his scientific determinism." Ridge, Michael. "Hobbesian Public Reason." Ethics 108 (1998): 538-68. Proposes an alternative understanding of "public rea- son." Notes that Hobbes's motivation for articulating a theory of public reason was his belief that everyone's reliance upon an individualistic mode of reasoning while interacting with one another would lead to destructive conflict. Explains that Hobbes thought that only an absolute sovereign could curtail this problem. Argues that the most plausible Hobbesian account of pub- lic reason today, one that shares his ambi- tion of deriving a conception of public rea- son from a conception of natural reason, would be one that substitutes the authori- zation of some public set of principles for Hobbes's advocation of a sovereign whose authority is completely unrestrained.

Argues that Killigrew owed his appoint- ment as manager of the King's Company in 1 660 to his closeness to Charles II more than to his managerial talents.

"Locke, Leibniz, and the Logic of Mechanism." Journal of the History of Philosophy 36 ( 1 998): 1 89-2 1 3. Explains that mechanists were philoso- phers who aspired to explain how phenom- ena are produced. Maintains that Leibniz, Locke, and Boyle subscribed to general mechanist theories since these theories "tapped the workman's grasp of what hap- pens when mechanical components are variously configured." Clark, S. H. "'The Whole Internal World His Own': Locke and Metaphor Reconsid- ered." JHI 59 (1998): 241-65. Contends that the poetic attributes of Locke's writ- ing offer a guide to the original impact of his work. Examines Locke's apparent re- nunciation of, yet dependence on metaphor. Concludes by analyzing the interdepen- dence of candle and sun in the light imag- ery in the Essay. Briefly mentions Blackmore, Milton, Newton, and Shaftesbury. Hansen, H. Vilhelm. "Locke and Whately on the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam ." Philoso- phy and Rhetoric 31 (1 998): 55-63. Argues that Locke's version of the argumentum ad ignorantiam was unlike the kind of argu- ment of the same name presented in con- temporary textbooks. Contends that Locke depicted the ad ignorantiam as a kind of social argument that claims victory for a proponent's view simply on the basis that this particular opponent cannot overcome the proponent. Also analyzes how Whately dealt with this kind of argument, arguing that he did not continue the Lockean tradi- tion. 106</page><page sequence="11">Jacobs, Struan and Allan McNeish. "Locke, McCann, and Voluntarism." Pacific Philo- sophical Quarterly 78 (1998): 349-62. Ar- gues that in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding Locke theorized "connec- tions of nature" as intrinsic and strictly necessary. Criticizes arguments for a rival account which depicts Lockean natural laws as expressions of or superadditions by the free, arbitrary, unconstrained will of God. Pasquino, Pasquale. "Locke on King's Pre- rogative." Political Theory 26 (1998): 198- 208. Contends that Locke makes the king's prerogative a central element in his politi- cal theory, from which he constructs a sys- tematic constitutional theory of extralegal power. Argues that for Locke the king's prerogative is rooted in history and "must make a compromise with the power of law and with legal government in a modem so- ciety, such that the predictability and cer- tainty of law appear as the very conditions of liberty and property." Figures mentioned or discussed include Filmer and Hale. Stanford, P. Kyle. "Reference and Natural Kind Terms: The Real Essence of Locke's View." Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 79 (1998): 78-97. Argues that, for Locke, a Real Essence consists of those features of an entity from which all of its observable or experienceable properties can be logi- cally deduced and that a substance's Real Essence consists of features of its Real Constitution plus logically necessary ob- jective connections between them and the features of a particular Nominal Essence. Challenges the standard account of Lockean Essences, claiming that this ac- count, espoused by J. L. Mackie, Paul Guyer, and Michael Ayers, misunderstands Locke's ideas. Swanson, Scott G. "The Medieval Founda- tions of John Locke's Theory of Natural Rights: Rights of Subsistence and the Prin- ciple of Extreme Necessity." History of Political Thought 18 (1997): 399-459. Ex- plains Locke's principle of subsistence rights, the idea that a person in extreme necessity, that is, facing the prospect of certain death, has the right to take the prop- erty of other people to sustain his or her own life. Argues that this principle is the "most radical formulation of the medieval belief that God had bestowed earth upon all mankind for its sustenance." Contends that understanding this principle is one of the fundamental keys to comprehending Locke's own understanding of natural rights. Traces the history of subsistence rights from the twelfth century to Locke's Treatises of Government. Also traces this principle among Locke's contemporaries, including Hobbes, Isaac Barrow, Morgan Godwin, and Tyrrell. Other figures men- tioned or discussed include Baxter, Filmer, Hale, and James II.

"Milton's Mephitic Muse: Plague, Religion and the Infection Meta- phor of Paradise Lost." Journal of Evolu- tionary Psychology 18 (1997): 238-48. Contends that the pestilence metaphor should be regarded as a key component of Milton's representation of evil in Paradise Lost. Suggests that Milton relied on per- sonal plague experience to illustrate the im- mediate corruption of good and the divine judgment of physical affliction that accom- panies evil and on biblical sources, espe- cially Exodus, to depict the remote, apoca- lyptic threat of turmoil caused by evil or apostasy. Burbery, Timothy J. 'The Representation of Samson's Eyes in Samson Agonistes." ELN 35.2 (1997): 27-32. Notes that in Samson Agonistes Samson's eyeballs remain intact and that his face appears normal and unin- jured despite having been violently blinded by the Philistines. Suggests that Milton's representation of Samson's eyes must be understood in terms of his own blindness and concludes that Milton based Samson on himself. Butler, George F. "Giants and Fallen Angels in Dante and Milton: The Commedia and the Gigantomachy in Paradise Lost." MP 95 (1998): 352-63. Argues that Dante's Commedia might have served as a prece- dent for Milton's association of the fall of the giants with the fall of Satan. Points out that "Milton's treatment of classical myth departs from his likeliest Greek and Ro- man sources" and "more closely resembles Dante's Christianization of the ancient texts." Maintains that details from Dante's work match those in Paradise Lost and that "both Dante and Milton allude to giantomachy in ways that suggest similar purposes." Canino, Catherine. "The Discourse of Hell: Paradise Lost and the Irish Rebellion." MiltonQ 32 (1998): 15-23. Claims that Milton's depiction of Satan and his fellow rebels may have drawn on the anti-Irish polemic of the 1640s. Finds many paral- lels between Milton's Paradise Lost and Thomas Waring's An Answer to Certain Seditious and Jesuitical Queries , includ- ing similarities between Milton's Satan and Waring's representation of Edmund Gawre, a Jesuit who defended the Irish rebellion of 1641 and condemned the En- glish occupation. Concludes that the anti- Irish rhetoric of the 1640s provided the poet with a model that saw rebellion as se- ductive, casuistical, and demonic and that allowed him to avoid allusions to the Puri- tan revolution. Corns, Thomas N. John Milton: The Prose Works. New York: Twayne, 1998. Studies Milton's English and Latin prose works to show how Milton's "courage in defending the execution of Charles I and the republic of Oliver Cromwell gave to the age some of its most enduring works of debate and endangered Milton's very life." Includes a chronology of Milton's life. Figures men- tioned or discussed include Bunyan, Charles II, Hobbes, James II, Monmouth, L'Estrange, Marten, William III, and Roger Williams. 165 pp. with index. Craze, Jack M. "Balls of Missive Ruin: Milton and the Gunpowder Revolution." The Cambridge Quarterly 26 ( 1 997): 325- 43. Considers "how revolutions in military art, subsequent to technological develop- 108</page><page sequence="13">ment, precipitate the decline of the old medieval order and its literature, and how these changes and attendant anxieties, most acute during the English Civil War, can be tracked in Paradise Lost and works of other seventeenth-century poets, such as Abraham Cowley." Surveys the major cul- tural objections to firearms and shows how issues of casualty, pain, and dismember- ment lead Milton to reject war as the pri- mary subject of epic and to propose revo- lutions in the arts of peace and concord. Also discusses Dryden's Annus Mirabilis. Dust, Philip. "Penitence in John Milton's Samson Agonistes and Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologiae ." CitharbT+1 .2 (1998): 15-21. Connects Milton's work with Aquinas's definition of penitence. Analyzes this connection to argue that Milton's Samson subjects himself to the power and mercy of God. Dzelzainis, Martin. " Paradise Lost II.4 and Seneca's Hercules Furens ." N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 49-50. Argues that Book II line 4 of Paradise Lost , "Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold," alludes to Seneca's Aeneid 11.504, "doors proud with the spoil of barbaric gold." Edwards, M. J. "Early Christian Authors and the Prologue to Paradise Lost ." N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 47-49. Notes the similarities be- tween Milton's "project of competing with the ancients on their own ground" and writ- ings by Jerome, Gregory Nazianzen, Roger Hutchinson, and Hesiod. Egan, James. "Milton's Aesthetic of Plain- ness, 1659-1673." SCen 1 1 (1997): 57-83. Argues that, in addition to a dialectical and structural economy, Milton's later politi- cal tracts reveal sophisticated, aesthetically rich applications of plainness in several distinct contexts as Milton's prose evolves from 1659 to 1673. Maintains that Milton theorizes about, experiments with, and transforms plainness as he writes about it in such works as A Treatise of Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes (1659), Consid- erations Touching the Likeliest Means to Remove Hirelings out of the Church ( 1 659), The Readie and Easie Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth (1660), Brief Notes Upon a Late Sennon (1660), and Of True Religion ( 1 673). Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Harrington and Sprat. Friedman, Donald M. "The Lady in the Gar- den: On the Literary Genetics of Milton's Eve." MiltonS 35 (1997): 1 14-33. Argues that the estate poems of the 1 650s played a part in shaping Milton's portrait of Eve in Paradise Lost. Concludes that Eden serves as the seat of Adam and Eve's "royal au- thority" just as the country house "conven- tionally stands for the quality of the family that inhabits it and expresses its relation to inherent authority in its chosen architec- tural style." Maintains that the figure of the woman in the garden in these poems stands "simultaneously for the intrinsic force of the natural and for the civilizing power that uniquely gives that force human shape, di- rection, and purpose" and that these fig- ures contribute to Milton's version of Eve. Mentions Marvell as one of the influences on Milton. Furman, Wendy and Virginia James Tufte. "'With Other Eyes': Legacy and Innova- tion in Four Artists' Re- Visions of the Din- ner Party in 'Paradise Lost.'" MiltonS 35 ( 1 997): 1 34-78.

Reproduces each artist's rendering of this scene. Hoxby, Blair. "Milton's Steps in Time." SEL 38 (1998): 149-72. Traces the motifs of time and patience in Milton's works to ar- gue that Milton's "prolusions and early verse betray Milton's anxiety that his sub- jective perceptions of time's passage are not accurate guides to providence." Con- cludes that in Samson Agonistes Milton "boldly confronts the contingency of his- tory, the limitations of foresight, and the possibility that posterity will misconstrue one's mission." Kennedy, Richard. "Milton in Poole's Parnassus!1 N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 50-53. Pro- 109</page><page sequence="14">vides twenty-four citations from Milton's early verse contained in Josua Poole's The English Parnassus (1657). Supplements the thirty-one citations noted by Alfred Farrell in 1943. Labriola, Albert C. "Chaos and Creation in Milton Studies: An Editor's Perspective." MiltonQ 32 (1998): 53-56. Contends that Milton studies can be divided into several interpretive communities. Discusses the role of the editor on the topic of Milton and imperialism, arguing that the politics of editing have the potential to create or re-create interpretive communities. Uses New Historicism and J. Martin Evans's Milton 's Imperial Epic: The Discourse of Colonialism ( 1 994) as the basis for his dis- cussion. Martin, Catherine Gimelli. "Fire, Ice and Epic Entropy: The Physics and Metaphysics of Milton's Reformed Chaos." MiltonS 35 (1997): 73-1 13. Examines "Milton's self- reflexive hermeneutics." Figures men- tioned or discussed include Newton and Ray. McMahon, Robert. "The Two Poets of Para- dise Lost ." Baton Rouge: Louisiana State UP, 1998. Analyzes the ambiguous rela- tionship between Milton the historical fig- ure and Milton the Bard in Paradise Lost. Argues that substantial changes in the poem indicate significant change in the poet and that Milton designed the movement of his epic to reveal the Bard's growth as a char- acter. Figures mentioned or discussed in- clude Addison, Sir William Davenant, and Dryden. McMurray, Price. "Aristotle on the Pinnacle: Paradise Regained and the Limits of Theory." MiltonQ 32 (1998): 7-14. Ana- lyzes the final confrontation between Christ and Satan on the pinnacle of the temple in Paradise Regained to argue that the eschatological promise of this brief epic is also a reminder of the limitations of theory and the necessity of faith. Examines Milton's likening of Christ with Oedipus to show how the poet distinguishes Satan from the tragic hero. Contends that Satan's fall is meaningful both as narrative and meta-narrative since his defense of oratory associates him with Aristotelian rational- ism and Christ with the sublime. Miller, Timothy C., ed. The Critical Response to Milton's Paradise Lost. Westport, CT: Greenwood Pr., 1997. Anthologizes criti- cal responses to Paradise Lost. Includes an introduction and sections on each cen- tury since the seventeenth century.

"'Now Hear Mee Relate': Narrative Emplotment and Auto- biography in Paradise Lost š" ELN 35.2 (1997): 9-17. Contends that Milton illus- trates the Puritan autobiographical method which emphasized "the conversion expe- rience as paving the way for a true and happy life" in Adam and Eve's stories of their "histories." Using Hayden White's Metahistory , argues that Eve's autobiog- raphy is told along Romantic lines, while Adam's is presented in Satiric terms. Ronnick, Michele Valerie. " Gravedo and Thermae : The Meaning of Milton's Warn- ing to More at Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda 182.24-184.3." N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 43-44. Explicates Milton's address to Alexander More to show that it pieces together ideas and phrases from Cicero, Catullus, and Martial to assault More and Salmasius in terms of style and character. Shawcross, John T. "John Milton and His Spanish and Portuguese Presence." MiltonQ 32 (1998): 41-52. Examines the "presence" of some Spanish and Portu- guese authors in Milton's work. Also looks at some eighteenth-century British writers who reflect Spanish and Portuguese con- texts. Simpson, Ken. "Lingering Voices, Telling Si- lences: Silence and the Word in Paradise 110</page><page sequence="15">Regained." MiltonS 35 (1997): 179-95. Analyzes the theme of silence and speech in Milton's Paradise Regained to argue that the interplay between these two actions "represents the difficulty of representing the Incarnation - the irreducible mystery of Jesus' identity." Also discusses the theo- logical traditions in which Milton worked, including the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite of the late fifth century, St. Augustine, and such Quaker writers as Robert Barclay, Alexander Parker, and Thomas Ellwood. Steadman, John M. "The God of Paradise Lost and the Divina Commedia ." Cithara 37.1 (1998): 22-42. Compares and con- trasts Milton's representation of God with Dante's. Contends that in each poet's por- trayal of the deity was contingent upon subject, genre, and the aspects of God that he wanted to emphasize. Argues that Milton's anthropomorphic God was in keeping with the character of a heroic poem and with his emphasis upon the deity as efficient cause. Voss, Paul J. "Debris from Heaven in Para- dise Lostr ELN 35.3 (1998): 37-40. Ex- amines the use of the word "rood" in Book I line 1 96 of Paradise Lost. Argues that this term refers to a specific measurement and thus allows Milton's readers to imagine a more definite sense of proportion in his description of Satan's size. Also contends that the meaning of "rood" as a cross is also important in the scene, casting Satan as a parody of Christ. Wilson, Hugh. "Unraveling the Snarled Chro- nology of Milton's Earliest 'Lives.'" MiltonQ 32 ( 1 998): 57-7 1 . Argues that the accounts of Milton's early life found in Edward Phillips's biography of Milton and the anonymous "Life of Mr. Milton" are mostly derived from Milton's own account of his life in Defensio Secunda. Contends that the two English biographies resemble one another more than they do Milton's own narrative. Maintains that the anony- mous biography tacitly criticized and con- densed Phillips's account.

Maintains that in the play adultery, like sodomy, murder, and deception, is a private act that can be made public to stage a political victory, but that this publicity potentially invites censure of both the private and political acts. Suggests that the world of the play discovers, from a Tory perspective, an inverted hierarchy in which Whigs own property and posi- tion while Tories live in poverty. Also ana- lyzes the play's representation of women's bodies as men's property and concludes that the play celebrates the disruption of the Whig order.

Ar- gues that Rochester's poetic and dramatic works critique the discourse of commerce and exchange within which he is writing. Claims that "Rochester's writing is preoc- cupied with the physical mechanics of sexuality yet repeatedly eschews issues of procreation and generation," which "indi- cates the ultimate barrenness of the total- izing philosophy it serves." Includes sug- gestions for further reading. Figures men- tioned or discussed include Barry, Dryden, Gwynne, Hobbes, Mulgrave, and Scroope. Combe, Kirk. A Martyr for Sin: Rochester's Critique of Polity, Sexualit y, and Society. Newark: U of Delaware P, 1998. Argues that Rochester's works expose the relation- ship between truth and power, in Michel Foucault's sense of those terms. Contends that many, if not all, of Rochester's writ- ings work to debunk particular truth-mak- ing mechanisms of Charles II's court, to unmask the affectations of the "luminaries of Whitehall," and to ridicule partrician social and literary practices. Maintains that Rochester is "an agent of naturally per- ceived chaos opposed to falsely reasoned order." Concludes that while Rochester subverted Charles II's regime on paper, he took no significant, direct political action to oppose it. 186 pp. with index.

"'Now . . . Didn't Our People Laugh?': Female Misbehavior and Algonquian Culture in Mary Rowlandson's Captivity and Restauration ." American Indian Culture and Research Journal 21 (1997): 1-28. Examines the dialogue formed when Algonquian voices and per- spectives intrude upon the Puritans' monological understanding of events in Rowlandson's captivity narrative. Argues that this intrusion is similar to Bahktin's notion of muffled laughter. Concludes that a close reading of Algonquian muffled laughter "provides us with a greater under- standing of the Algonquian side of early cross-cultural encounters" and "reveals the ways in which cultural discomfort and dis- harmony are not anomalies, but rather were integral concepts for early American iden- tity."

Contends that, despite their obvious dif- ferences involving region, gender, and Native American cultures, these two works have significant similarities.

"Reasonable Ecstasies: Shaftesbury and the Languages of Libertinism." Journal of British Studies 37 (1998): 1 1 1-38. Argues that Shaftesbury's sexual philosophy reflected the anxieties of a country whig alienated from both court and metropolitan London societies. Con- tends that these anxieties were gendered, that Shaftesbury abhorred the female- dominated polite society of mixed com- pany and did not consider homosociality, and perhaps even homosexuality, as eff emi- nate. Concludes that the Earl's belief in the moral superiority of exclusive and intimate male companionship structured both his friendships and his rhetoric on ethical, so- cial, and political ideals.

"An Aesthetic of Anomaly: Edward Taylor's 'Preface' to His 'Gods De- terminations,' My Mother and the Trolley, and Some Thoughts on Involuntary Com- edy." Studies in American Humor , series 3, 4 (1997): 15-46. Describes the author's humorous responses to Taylor's "Preface" and "Gods Determinations." Craig, Raymond A. "The 'Peculiar Elegance' of Edward Taylor's Poetics." See Schuldiner' s The Tayloring Shop below, 68-101 . Argues that a poetics of scriptural allusion operates within Taylor's Prepatory Meditations which has its basis in the con- cept of "spiritual elegance" found in St. Augustine's De Doctrina Christiana. Con- tends that this concept is given its Puritan formulation in John Cotton's Singing of Psalmes. Maintains that Taylor extensively used Cotton's ideas in his work. Guruswamy, Rosemary Fithian. "A Farewell to David: Edward Taylor's Valediction and Psalm 19." See Schuldiner's The Tayloring Shop below, 193-216. Discusses the per- vasiveness of psalmody in Puritan life and letters and shows that Taylor used Psalm 1 9 as the working model for the three drafts of his "Valedictory Poems." Demonstrates that in Taylor's case the Psalms served as an anchor to his art virtually until his death. Argues that the way in which Taylor adapts the psalmist's imagery and ideas "allows him to acknowledge his closeness to glori- fication in heaven." Mentions Edward Johnson. Hammond, Jeffrey A. "'Diffusing All by Pat- tern': Edward Taylor as Elegist." See Schuldiner's The Tayloring Shop below, 153-92. Maintains that Taylor's elegies were experienced by Taylor and his com- munity of readers in a manner that "stimu- lates self-definition as a saint and thereby furthers postconversion assurance of sal- vation." Briefly compares Taylor's elegies with Milton's "Lycidas." Jeske, Jeff. "Edward Taylor and the Traditions of Puritan Nature Philosophy." See Schuldiner's The Tayloring Shop below, 27- 67. Presents the history of seventeenth and early eighteenth-century New England Puritanism and charts the development of the image of nature, from nature as wilder- ness to nature as book to nature as machine. Argues that Taylor is a transitional poet whose Preparatory Meditations make use of imagery derived from each of these phases in the development of the image of nature. Often compares Taylor's work with those of Bradstreet, Cotton Mather, In- crease Mather, and Wigglesworth. Patterson, J. Daniel. "The Homilectic Design of Edward Taylor's Gods Determinations ." See Schuldiner's The Tayloring Shop be- low, 1 3 1 -50. Argues that the structure and rhetorical strategies that Taylor uses in Gods Determinations are those typically found in the traditional sermon as well as in the manuals that guided Puritan clergy in the composition of sermons. Schuldiner, Michael. "Puritan Casuistry and the Character of the Three Ranks of Soul in Edward Taylor's Gods Determinations ." See Schuldiner's The Tayloring Shop be- low, 105-30. Maintains that much of what is obscure in Taylor's long poem, Gods Determinations , is clarified by a familiar- ity with case divinity and that the poem can be read as a verse study of Puritan casu- istry. 115</page><page sequence="20">. ed.

Argues that Tom Fashion, who passes himself off as his brother Lord Foppington to marry Hoyden Clumsey, is an incarnation of the Lord of Misrule and that his actions follow the pattern of the misruler's "brief but ecstatic career." Con- tends that recognizing Fashion's function- ing within the pattern of misrule "clarifies his true nature and reconciles differing views of him" by various scholars. Also maintains that this identification explains the apparent disintegration of the outwit- ting pattern in the play's subplot involving Fashion. Mentions Behn.

Maintains that Waller sought to dis- tract others from less noble aspects of his biography and that his contemporaries and successors wanted a reassuring model of English poetic and linguistic change.

Claims that the poem combines two discordant images of the deity: an in- scrutable autocrat impervious to human needs and values, and an intelligent law- giver solicitous for the rights of the ag- grieved. 116</page><page sequence="21">See also: EDWARD TAYLOR (Jeske), NON- DRAMATIC LITERATURE (Kubiak) WILLIAM III See: ASTELL (Springborg), BUNYAN (Mullett), BURNET (Greig), DRYDEN (Caldwell, Gardiner, Zwicker), MILTON (Corns), NON-DRAMATIC LITERA- TURE (McFarlane, Seidel), HISTORY (Grassby, Herrick, Patterson, Rosenheim, Spurr), SISTER ARTS (Thurley) JOHN WILLIAMS See: ROWLANDSON (Bauer) ROGER WILLIAMS See: MILTON (Corns), ROWLANDSON (Arnold) Anne Finch, COUNTESS OF WIN- CHILSEA See: BEHN (Ferguson), NON-DRAMATIC LITERATURE (Bhattacharya, Doody, Rainbolt, Runge, Scodel) ANTHONY A.

"The Sartorial Her- maphrodite." ANQ 10.1 (1997): 9-12. Sug- gests that Quack's declaration in The Country Wife that, when the women hear of Horner's impotence, he will become to them as loathsome as "aniseed Robin of filthy and contemptible memory" equates Horner with both a hermaphrodite and a male transvestite. Examines James Caulfield's 1794 Portraits , Memoirs and Characters of Remarkable Persons from the Reign of Edward III and Mary Firth's posthumous 1661 autobiography to con- tend that aniseed Robin's clothing must have marked him as a hermaphrodite. Ar- gues that this comparison reflects Wycherley's view that "the male transves- tite was no longer a figure of admiration or even identification for women but one odious to them." Thomas, Graham C.

Brown and Arthur F. Marotti. New York: St. Martin's Pr., 1997. 225-47. Analyzes the changing representation of homoerotic desire in the seventeenth century by examining how texts from the Renaissance became unac- ceptable to subsequent generations. Par- ticularly discusses Nahum Tate's adapta- tion of Coriolanus , Ingratitude of a Com- monwealth (1682), and Dryden's adapta- tion of Troilus and Cressida ( 1 679).

NON-DRAMATIC LITERATURE Bhattacharya, Nandini. Reading the Splendid Body: Gender and Consumerism in Eigh- teenth-Century British Writing on India. Newark: U of Delaware P, 1998. Exam- ines images of the Indian subaltern woman in the early British colonial period to dem- onstrate that the problematic visibility of subordinate women in the colonial era is a significant trope of cross-cultural encoun- ters. Chapter 3 investigates the "oppressive gender and ethnopolitical ideologies" in Dryden's Aureng-Zebe , arguing that the sexuality of the female body in this play is defined as private and unobtrusive in the sphere of politics. Chapter 5 includes a dis- cussion of Behn's Oroonoko. Figures men- tioned or discussed include Astell, Chudleigh, Charles Davenant, Settle, Steele, and Winchilsea. 232 pp. with in- dex.

Analyzes the ideological underpinnings of Milton's and Marvell's works in order to examine the reasons why these writers be- came ideological authorities for the Whigs beginning in the 1670s. Focuses on these writers' anti-Catholicism, polemic against tyrannical or arbitrary government, and toleration of dissent for Protestant sects. Argues that Milton's and Marvell's anti- Catholicism made the Whig appropriation possible. Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or discussed include Blount, Toland, and Tyrrell. Bryden, D. J. "Capital in the London Pub- lishing Trade: James Moxon's Stock Dis- posal of 1698, A 'Mathematical Lottery.'"

Maintains that the ephemeral proposals provide detail that allows the minimum quality and retail value of Moxon's stock to be calculated and that these stock levels provide a useful economic insight into the activities of a publisher, printer, engraver, map-seller, globe maker, and retailer of mathematical instruments. Figures men- tioned or discussed include William Berry, Boyer, Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemain, Hooke, Mary II, Ogilby, and Pepys. Doody, Margaret.

Claims that "at least until very recent times no literary era has been as conscious of what we call 'gender' as the period we call 'the Restoration.'" Surveys the period's attitudes toward gender roles by briefly examining works by Barker, Behn, Congreve, Dryden, Anne Killigrew, Milton, Philips, Rochester, and Winchilsea. Includes suggestions for further reading. Other figures mentioned or discussed in- clude Aubrey, Charles II, Hobbes, Newcastle, Swift, and Wycherley. Hammond, Paul. "Classical Texts: Transla- tions and Transformations." See BIBLI- OGRAPHIES (Zwicker), 143-61. Exam- ines the use of Roman material for politi- cal purposes in Restoration and early eigh- teenth-century poetry. Argues that this use was marked by local and structural ten- sions, often due to writers' distrust of the classics' ideological standpoints. Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or discussed include Cowley, Dryden, Marvell, Oldham, and Waller. Jasper, David. "The Twenty-Third Psalm in English Literature." R&amp;L 30.1 (1998): 1- 1 1 .

"Scene One/Warning Signs: Puritanism and the Early American Theatres of Cruelty." Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism 12.2(1998): 15-34. Suggests a reassessment of early Ameri- can Puritan texts, especially diaries, through the ontological lens of mise en scene. Argues that these texts "enact an un- canny grasp of theatrical consciousness" and that this consciousness represents the re-emergence of the theater that Puritan- ism had repressed. Includes a lengthy dis- cussion of Wigglesworth's diary. McFarlane, Cameron. The Sodomite in Fic- tion and Satire, 1660-1750. New York: Columbia UP, 1997. Studies the represen- tation of sodomy and the sodomite during the Restoration and first half of the eigh- teenth century to argue that the term "sod- omite" increasingly referred to sexual con- tact between two males. Introduction con- siders debates on essenti al ism and con- structionism, surveys the most important gay historiography of the period, and sug- gests "that the identity-inflected enquiry which presently characterizes gay studies of this period has precipitated a somewhat questionable means of reading historical documents." Chapter 1 traces the emer- gence of the sodomite as a secularized so- cial type. Chapter 2 argues that this vision of the sodomite "provided a compelling figure onto which a variety of social anxi- eties could be displaced." Chapter 3 con- centrates on Smollett's oeuvre and the fi- nal chapter provides a reading of Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure. Figures mentioned or discussed include Charles II, Defoe, Dorset, Evelyn, Gwynne, James II, Lee, Manley, Oldham, Pepys, Rochester, Sedley, and William III. 216 pp. with in- dex. Mullan, John. "Swift, Defoe, and Narrative Forms." See BIBLIOGRAPHIES (Zwicker), 250-75. Compares and contrasts Swift's Gulliver's Travels with Defoe's Robinson Crusoe to argue that contemporary audi- ences delighted in "what seemed strange 121</page><page sequence="26">but true." Also examines Swift's and Defoe's other prose narratives and con- cludes that Swift ridicules "the world to which Defoe's narrators look forward - the world of novels." Includes suggestions for further reading. Porter, Roy. "Reading Is Bad for Your Health." History Today 48. 3 (1998): 1 1-16. Surveys the history of "books against books" since the sixteenth century.

Figures men- tioned or discussed include Behn, Locke, Newcastle, and Woolley. Rainbolt, Martha. "Their Ancient Claim: Sappho and Seventeenth- and Eighteenth- Century British Women's Poetry." SCen 1 1 (1997): 1 1 1-134. Argues that Sappho had an important influence on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century women's poetry as a whole, not just on individual women au- thors. Begins with a description of which texts of Sappho were available to these writers. Maintains that male writers used Sappho's name as a label both to condemn and to praise contemporary women writ- ers. Contends that women writers recon- structed Sappho's image in a positive way to authenticate their practices as writers. Figures mentioned or discussed include Addison, Behn, Anne Killigrew, Philips, and Winchilsea. Runge, Laura. Gender and Language in Brit- ish Literary Criticism, 1660-1790. Cam- bridge: Cambridge UP, 1 997. Contends that the meaning of such gendered words as "manly" and "effeminate" changed over the course of the eighteenth century and that literary criticism cannot be fully un- derstood without careful consideration of gendered language during this era. Exam- ines conventions in Dryden's prose, the early novel, criticism by women, and aes- thetics to show how gendered epistemol- ogy shaped critical "truths." Figures men- tioned or discussed include Addison, Astell, Barker, Behn, Boyle, Charles II, Collier, Congreve, Cowley, Dennis, Locke, Manley, Marvell, Milton, Newcastle, Or- rery, Philips, Pix, Rochester, Rymer, Shadwell, Shaftesbury, Sprat, Steele, Swift, Waller, Winchilsea, and Wycherley. Scodel, Joshua. "Lyric Forms." See BIBLI- OGRAPHIES (Zwicker), 120-42.

Analyzes the works of Addison, Steele, and Defoe, including The Spectator , The Tatler, and The Review, to demonstrate the relationship between news sources and the novel during the early eighteenth century. Aigues that "there is a marked flow from news to some of the ur-forms of fiction in the pe- riod" and examines the "affective side" of news. Explains how some writers extracted material from the letter columns of newspa- pers and journals for use in fictional form later.

Exam- ines British nationalism as a "hegemonic' concept" and argues that "the determina- tion of the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish Prot- estant elite to link their fates with that of the British state" led to the formation of a specifically British consciousness. Boehrer, Bruce. "'Men, Monkeys, Lap-dogs, Parrots, Perish All!' Psittacine Articulacy in Early Modem Writing." MLQ 59 ( 1 998): 1 7 1 -93. Analyzes the shift in the symbolic value of parrots in British literature from Skelton's poetry to Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Argues that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries parrots began to lose the mythical status granted them by Boccaccio, Skelton, and others and increas- ingly became objects of "literary fun." Contends that parrots helped to constitute a model of limited articulacy that colonial educators used to reinforce their various hegemonic and ethnic relationships with subject peoples. Includes a brief discussion of Locke's retelling of a humorous anec- dote from Sir William Temple concerning parrots. Cantor, Geoffrey, "Quakers in the Royal So- ciety, 1660-1750." Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 51 .2 (1997): 175-93. Claims that, contrary to current perceptions, the first Quakers were not elected into the Royal Society until the 1720s. Maintains that, although William Penn was the first Quaker to be nominated for membership in the Royal Society, he was not actually admitted to the Society and did not pay his dues. Argues that Quak- ers used the Royal Society to relate to the world of London science outside their in- sular community. Also contends that Quak- ers developed business connections through the Society and that they found it congenial because it did not discriminate against dissenters. Suggests that Quakers approved of science because of its useful- ness and because it helped them appreci- ate God's handiwork. Carlos, Ann M., Jennifer Key, and Jill L. Dupree. "Learning and the Creation of Stock-Market Institutions: Evidence from the Royal African and Hudson's Bay Com- panies, 1 670- 1 700." The Journal of Eco- nomic History 58 (1998): 318-44. Uses a 30-year time series of the share transac- tions of the Royal African and Hudson's Bay Companies to examine the growth of the London capital market prior to and immediately after the Glorious Revolution. Argues that the London experience with open capital markets was not solely the result of the property rights changes that accompanied the change in regimes. Con- cludes that the learning by private individu- als and goldsmith bankers that took place before 1 689 paved the way for the growth of these markets. Churches, Christine. "Women and Property in Early Modern England: A Case Study." Social History 23 (1998): 165-80. Studies parish registers, marriage bonds, and sur- viving wills from the town of Whitehaven between 1660 and 1750 to argue that among "ordinary families" daughters in- herited property on "a remarkably equitable basis with their brothers." Also contends that widows were generally the beneficia- ries of their husbands' wills and that the widows of intestate men enjoyed at least as many benefits as the widows of men who made wills. Concludes that, at the ordinary social level, primogeniture did not domi- nate the distribution of property. Clark, Gregory. "Land Hunger: Land as a Commodity and as a Status Good, England, 1500-1910." Explorations in Economic History 35. 1 ( 1998): 59-82. Argues that any change in the land market in England from 123</page><page sequence="28">1560 to 1910 was a result of a shift from land as a commodity in preindustrial En- gland to land as a status good in industrial England. Provides extensive analysis of rents, property values, and investment re- turns on land during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Condren, Conal. "Liberty of Office and its Defense in Seventeenth-Century Political Argument." History of Political Thought 1 8 (1997): 460-82. Argues that recent schol- arship has misunderstood seventeeth-cen- tury notions of liberty, which revolved around the idea of "liberty of office," the freedom to fulfill the obligations of one's office. Particularly analyzes the ways in which Hobbes's statements on liberty have been "misconstrued." Figures mentioned or discussed include Charles II, Defoe, James II, Locke, Marvell, and Milton. Craig, Simon. "No Ordinary Man." Geo- graphical Magazine 70.3 (1998): 65-69. Follows the voyages of William Dampier (1651-1715) from his appointment by the British Admiralty in 1698 to explore New Holland (Australia) to his privateering ex- peditions in 1703 to 1708. Faults Dampier for missing several opportunities to make important discoveries in Australia but praises him for discovering that New Guinea is separated from New Britain by a passage now known as Dampier Strait. Summarizes Dampier's 1702 court martial for cruelty toward his second-in-command. Concludes that "This was clearly no ordi- nary man" and calls for additional research on the life and career of this explorer. Demause, Lloyd. "The History of Child Abuse." The Journal of Psy chohistory 25 (1998): 216-36. Suggests that "child abuse has been humanity's most powerful and most successful ritual" and argues that "the eradication of child abuse and neglect is the most important task we face today." Begins with a explanation of the main psy- chological mechanism that operates in child abuse. Describes child abuse today and traces its history since 400 B.C., in- cluding a discussion of "intrusive" child- bearing during the seventeeth century. Ends with a call for "an entirely new profession of 'child helpers' who can reach out to ev- ery new child born on earth and help its parents give it love and independence." First delivered as a speech at the National Parenting Conference in Boulder, Colo- rado, on September 25, 1997. Fox, Frank L. "Hired Men-of-War, 1 664- 1 667 (Part One)." The Mariner's Mirror 84 (1998): 13-25. Narrates the circumstances surrounding the use of 43 hired merchant ships in the English battlefleet during the second Anglo-Dutch War. Describes the use of hired ships in the West Indies, ex- plains who owned these ships, details the terms of the ships' hire, discusses the rules for indemnification, and the ways in which the ships were modified for war and fitted out. Also explains how officers were se- lected to command these ships. . "Hired Men-of-War, 1664-1667 (Part Two)." The Mariner's Mirror 84 (1998): 152-72. Consists of three lists of the 43 merchantmen hired as men-of-war in 1 664- 1667, giving as much information as could be found concerning these long-neglected vessels. List One tabulates the ships' ages, physical characteristics, and contracting owners or owner's representatives. List Two is a summary of hirings by place and month, giving periods of hire, monthly hire fees, and appraised value. List Three gives details of the ships' service under hire. Gaskill, Malcolm. "Reporting Murder: Fic- tion in the Archives in Early Modern En- gland." Social History 23.1 (1998): 1-30. Focuses primarily on the interpretation of deposition accounts, printed pamphlets, and broadsides to argue that "in early mod- ern England many witnesses appearing before magistrate and coroners in cases of suspected murder presented their evidence within a supernatural narrative framework, or otherwise embellished it to communi- cate local beliefs about a certain suspect or version of events and thus heighten its prob- able effects." Examines popular forensic methods and analyzes eyewitness accounts of murders committed between 1 570 and 1750. 124</page><page sequence="29">Gladfelder, Hal. "Criminal Trials and the Di- lemmas of Narrative Realism, 1 650- 1 750." Prose Studies 20 (1997): 21-48. Focuses on the changes in the ways that trials were reported from 1650 to 1750. Demonstrates how the representational preoccupations of trial reports anticipated the practice of re- alism in other kinds of narrative, including the novel, during the same period. Claims that trials provided "an ideologically reso- nant and commercially proven model of open-ended narrative construction" for writers of fiction. Figures mentioned or discussed include Bunyan and Defoe. Goodwin, Peter. "The Influence of Iron in Ship Construction: 1660 to 1830." The Mariner's Mirror 84 (1998): 26-40. Sur- veys the use of iron in ship construction from 1660 to 1830. Briefly discusses Sir Anthony Deane's use of "iron dogs" to se- cure the beams of the Royal James in 1 670 and Pepys's opposition to this innovation. Includes several pictures and diagrams to illustrate the history of iron use. Grassby, Richard. "The Decline of Falconry in Early Modern England." Past and Present 157 (1997): 37-62. Reconstructs the role of falconry in pre-industrial En- gland and examines its complicated ritu- als, including songs, calls, etiquette, vo- cabulary, costumes, and ceremonies. Ar- gues that falconry was replaced by shoot- ing and pursuing foxes with hounds dur- ing the eighteenth century due to several factors, including a shortage in the num- ber of available hawks, the sport's static technology, changes in the rural economy, and urbanization. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Aubrey, Charles II, Harrington, James II, Mary II, and Will- iam III. Green, Karen, and John Bigelow. "Does Sci- ence Persecute Women? The Case of the 16th- 17th Century Witch-hunts." Philoso- phy 73 (1998): 195-217. Uses an analysis of early modern witch-hunts to argue that "not all belief is mere ideology." Argues that the witch-hunters were practising "bad science." Contends that this practice of bad science suggests that acquiring knowledge is not just a matter of choosing the dogma that suits your interests. Briefly mentions Locke. Herrick, James. The Radical Rhetoric of the English Deists: The Discourse of Skepti- cism, 1680-1750. Presents a rhetorical study of the English Deists of the late sev- enteenth and early eighteenth centuries. Demonstrates that the doctrines of the De- ists, though widely varied, are best under- stood as rhetoric, as addressed to readers in a particular historical circumstance and in the context of a bitter public controversy over rationality in religious reflection. Fig- ures mentioned or discussed include Addison, Blount, Burnet, Collins, Defoe, Dryden, Evelyn, Hobbes, James II, Locke, Newton, Shaftesbury, Swift, Toland, Whiston, and William III. Holt, P. M. 'The Study of Islam in Seven- teenth- and Eighteenth-Century England." Journal of Early Modern History 2 ( 1 998): 113-23. Surveys seventeenth- and eigh- teenth-century English writing on Islam, including works by Edward Pococke ( 1 650), Humphrey Prideaux ( 1 697), Simon Ockley (1708), George Sale (1734), and Joseph White (1784). Kelly, James. "The Pirate, the Ambassador, and the Map-Maker." History Today 48.7 (1998): 49-55. Narrates the events surrounding the trial and surprise acquittal of Captain Bartholomew Sharpe and two members of his crew in 1 68 1 on charges of the piracy of a Spanish vessel and the murder of her captain. Demonstrates that Charles II sought to ma- nipulate the legal process in order to secure Sharpe's acquittal. Maintains that the king sought to acquire Sharpe's help in interpret- ing the charts and pilotage directions that Sharpe had taken from the Spanish ship, docu- ments that gave England vital information about the American Pacific rim. Concludes that Charles was unable to capitalize on this information before his death in 1 685. Includes several illustrations from contemporary sources on piracy and from William Hack's charts based on Sharpe's information. Also provides a brief list of works for further read- ing. 125</page><page sequence="30">Lawson-Peebles, Robert. "The Many Faces of Sir Walter Ralegh." History Today 48.3 (1998): 17-24. Examines the cultural con- struction of Sir Walter Ralegh's image and reputation in literary and historical works in England and America since the sixteenth century. Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or discussed include Addison, Aubrey, Fuller, Harrington, Milton, and Purcell. Lewis, Judith. "'Tis a Misfortune to Be a Great Ladie': Maternal Mortality in the British Aristocracy, 1558-1959." Journal of British Studies 37. 1 ( 1 998): 26-53. Main- tains that between 1558 and 1959 mater- nal mortality was experienced by fewer than five percent of all childbearing women, considerably lower than previ- ously thought. Examines why the advan- tages normally associated with elite status did not give aristocratic women a clearer edge over the lower classes. Concludes that behavior patterns peculiar to the aristoc- racy put women of that class at greater risk. Includes evidence from the experiences of several Restoration aristocratic women. Matar, Nabil. "Alexander Ross and the First Translation of the Qur'an." The Muslim World 88 ( 1 998): 8 1 -92. Traces the history of the Qur'an in England from the 1630s through 1700, primarily focusing on Alexander Ross's 1 649 English translation. Ross's edition was the first complete En- glish translation of the Qur'an and was the only edition available until the 1710s. Ex- plains Ross's interest in translating this re- ligious work and briefly describes the trans- lation. Traces the edition's popularity dur- ing the Restoration period and by describ- ing scholarly attacks on Ross's work. Con- cludes that, because of Ross's translation, poets, theologians, and politicians men- tioned the Qur'an with greater frequency from the Interregnum to the end of the sev- enteenth century. Morgan, Paul. "County Feasts." N&amp;Q 243 (1998): 54-64. Lists sermons from the Short-title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and British America . . . 1641-1700 that con- tain references to county feasts. Arranged alphabetically by county or city and then by date. Osier, Margaret J. "Mixing Metaphors: Sci- ence and Religion or Natural Philosophy and Theology in Early Modern Europe." History of Science 36 ( 1 998): 91-113. Ex- amines the metaphors historians have used to describe the relationship between sci- ence and religion in the early modern pe- riod, including metaphors of harmony, con- flict, and segregation, to demonstrate the flaws inherent in the assumption that dis- ciplinary boundaries have remained static throughout history. Suggests that natural philosophy and Christian theology were products of the same cultural and intellec- tual heritage, causing these two domains to overlap frequently. Argues that new metaphors of "appropriation and transla- tion" are more compatible with the newly emerging historiography of the Scientific Revolution, one that sees a difference be- tween past and present intellectual preoc- cupations. Firgures mentioned or discussed include Boyle, More, Newton, and Ray. Patterson, Annabel. Early Modern Liber- alism. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1997. Argues that liberalism's central ideas were formulated by seventeenth-century English writers in defiance of their society's norms and were then transmit- ted to the American colonies. Examines the means and agents of this transmis- sion and shows what early modern lib- erals had in common. Chapter Two main- tains that Milton was a preeminent ex- ample of early modern liberalism. Chap- ters Three and Four study early modern juridical practices and the trial of Algernon Sidney. Chapter Seven analyzes Locke's liberalism. Figures mentioned or discussed include Bunyan, Burnet, Charles II, Clar- endon, Danby, Defoe, Filmer, Halifax, Harrington, Hobbes, James II, Kneller, L' Estrange, Ludlow, Manley, Marvell, Mary II, Molesworth, Molyneaux, Parker, Penn, Shaftesbury, Swift, Sir William Temple, Toland, Tyrrell, and William III. 314 pp. with index. 126</page><page sequence="31">Peck, Linda Levy. "Uncovering the Arundel Library at the Royal Society: Changing Meanings of Science and the Fate of the Norfolk Donation." Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 52 (1998): 3- 24. Traces the history of the Arundel Library's holdings from its founding in 1 667 to the present to argue that the Royal Society's choice of books to place in the library reflects its changing notions of what was designated as science as what was not. Figures mentioned or discussed include Evelyn, Hooke, Pepys, and Wren. Pesic, Peter. "Secrets, Symbols, and Systems: Parallels between Cryptanalysis and Alge- bra, 1580-1700." Isis 88 (1997): 674-92. Explores the relationship between math- ematics and codebreaking during the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries to argue that François Viète's concept of his "new algebra" parallels those employed in his art of decryption. Figures mentioned or dis- cussed include Boyle, Charles II, and John Wallis. Pincus, Steve. "Neither Machiavellian Mo- ment nor Possessive Individualism: Com- mercial Society and the Defenders of the English Commonwealth." American His- torical Review 103 (1998): 705-36. Places the political economy of Milton and James Harrington alongside the publications of the defenders of the English Common- wealth during the 1 650s to argue that, while the conception of liberty put forth by Milton and Harrington was "conceptually indistinguishable from a wide variety of other defenders of the Commonwealth," many of these other defenders "developed a political economy and a conception of interest appropriate to a commercial economy." Argues that this new concep- tion valued wealth but also the common good, human choice, and historical change. Concludes that this ideology is more ac- curately considered "liberalism" rather than "republicanism" and rejected Machiavelli^ political economy and moderated his celebra- tion of civic virtue. Briefly traces the influ- ence of this brand of liberalism on Locke's work and on the revolution of 1 688-89. Remington, Gordon L. "Robert Huestis of Westchester County: His Ancestry and De- scendants." The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record 129 (1998): 1- 12. Presents "a definitive study" of Huestis's family and descendants for three generations and establishes that his son Samuel Huestis "was the ancestor of most, if not all, persons bearing the Huestis name or its variants in lower Westchester county in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Claims to correct Robert Bolton Jr.'s "er- roneous" 1 848 account of the family and traces the residences of Huestis and his descendants from the 1620s through the 1730s. Ringrose, David R. "Capital Cities, Urban- ization, and Modernization in Early Mod- ern Europe." Journal of Urban History 24 ( 1 998): 1 55-83. Argues that the seventeenth century "saw the European market economy afflicted by demographic stag- nation, economic dislocations, and a marked halt in the growth of the small and mid-size cities associated with market- based urban integration." Suggests that a few rapidly expanding political capitals witnessed the majority of the growth in urban population during the century. Roelofs, H. Mark. "Democratic Dialectics." The Review of Politics 60 (1998): 5-29. Aims to define "democracy," its modern variants, and their possible futures. Argues that the dominant "democratic" tradition divides into three often antagonistic strands: liberal democracy, social revolu- tionary democracy, and participatory de- mocracy. Contends that these strands should be seen not only as distinct and di- verse but also as standing in a "profound and significant Hegelian relationship with each other." Discusses extensively Hobbes's contribution to the foundation of contemporary political theory, arguing that Hobbes turned classical political philoso- phy into ideology. Mentions Locke. Rosenheim, James. The Emergence of a Rul- ing Order: English Landed Society ' 1650- 1750. London: Longman, 1998. Argues that the shared activities and common in- 127</page><page sequence="32">terests of landed gentlemen and noblemen set them apart from other groups in soci- ety and fostered an emerging awareness of local and national civic responsibility. Con- cludes that by 1750 the landed elite repre- sented a unique and dynamic social order: one that was still based on their country estates, but was also far more metropoli- tan and cosmopolitan in outlook than a hundred years before. Includes chapters on "Birth, Marriage, and Education," "Ag- riculture, the Landed Estate, and Business," "The Transformation of County Identity," "Cultural Separation and Cultural Identity," and 'The Influence of the Me- tropolis." Figures mentioned or discussed include Astell, Aubrey, Banks, Buckingham, Burnet, Charles II, Coventry, Danby, Defoe, Etherege, Evelyn, James II, Locke, North, Pepys, Purcell, Steele, Swift, Sir Richard Temple, Vanbrugh, William III, and Wycherley. Saxby, David, and Damian Goodburn. "Seventeeth-Century Ships' Timbers and Dock on the Thames Waterfront at Bellamy's Wharf, Rotherhithe, London SEI 6." The Mariners Mirror 84 (1998): 173-92. Examines the details of ship and dock construction during the seventeenth century provided by the archaeological excavation of Bellamy's Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, Southwark SE 16 in January and February 1995. Concludes that the dock was probably built by the shipbreaker and timber merchant Thomas Gould between 1 660 and 1 670 and that the ship timbers used to rebuild the dock were taken from at least two ships broken up by Gould around 1667-70. Contends that the first ship was likely to have been a large Dutch vessel, perhaps dating from the mid- seventeenth century, and that the second ship might have been one of two ships burnt by the Dutch in the Medway or a vessel accidentally burned in 1668. Includes sev- eral illustrations, maps, and photographs from the excavation to explain the gath- ered evidence. Spurr, John. "England 1649-1750: Differ- ences Contained?" See BIBLIOGRA- PHIES (Zwicker), 3-32. Surveys the "transformation of English political, social, and religious life" between the Civil War and the reign of George II. Argues that Augustan England was "divided, ill at ease with itself, and yet successful and stable." Divides English history during this time into three periods, 1 649- 1 689, 1 689- 1714, and 1715-1745, and discusses the major historical events of each. Also outlines the rise of party politics and the division of England's political elite into Court and Country parties, the changing relationship between the state and society, and the con- struction of civility. Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or discussed include Addison, Charles II, Clarendon, Danby, James II, Locke, Mary II, Monmouth, Oates, Shaftesbury, Steele, Swift, and William III. Tudor-Craig, Pamela. "Times and Tides." History Today 48.1 (1998): 2-5. Surveys the history of the wheelchair since 1598. Includes photos and illustrations of four innovations in the construction of chairs as aids for invalids. Quotes John Evelyn, who had seen a sleeping chair in Rome in 1644. Walker, Garthine. "Rereading Rape and Sexual Violence in Early Modern En- gland." Gender &amp; History 10 (1998): 1- 25. Historicizes occurrences and accusa- tions of rape during the seventeenth cen- tury by analyzing over 1 00 narratives from a range of common and canon law courts of the period. Concludes that "the recorded speech of early modem people" concern- ing sexual violence "was necessarily a product of a complex interaction of indi- vidual and social processes" and that the manner in which this violence was de- scribed relied on the availability of appro- priate languages, images, concepts, and schémas that were dictated by the rhetori- cal situation. Contends that rape was gen- erally "articulated as an act of male vio- lence rather than as a sexual act;" that physical resistance was usually under- played; and that the avoidance of rape was predominantly attributed to flight to the 128</page><page sequence="33">assistance of others. Also notes that sexual imagery often appears in these narratives as the tragic antithesis of procreational sex, as the violation of the woman's most pri- vate boundaries, and as a brutal expression of the man's obsessive love. COLONIES Breslaw, Elaine G. 'Tituba's Confession: The Multicultural Dimensions of the 1692 Sa- lem Witch-Hunt." Ethnohistory 44 (1997): 535-5 1 . Examines Tituba's role in the Sa- lem, Massachusetts, witch scare of 1692. Rejects the notion that she was an African American or that she was involved in oc- cult activities prior to February 1692. Em- phasizes the multiethnic factors in Tituba's behavior, which included English, African, and American Indian elements, and the in- fluence of her American Indian background on the Puritan response. Occasionally quotes Cotton Mather's account of the witch trials. Chartrand, René. "Early British Regulars in Canada, 1697-1717." Journal of the Soci- ety for Army Historical Research 76 (1998): 1-4. Traces the history of the first British regular troops to be in garrison in what is now Canada from 1697, when the men of Colonel John Gibson's (or Gibbon's) infantry regiment arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland, to 1 7 1 7, when four independent companies, including the one at St. John's, was formed into a regiment. Also describes the kinds of uniforms these men wore. Includes two illustrations that reconstruct the appearance of these uni- forms. Rosenthal, Bernard. 'Tituba's Story." The New England Quarterly 71 (1998): 190- 203. Traces and critiques the scholarship on Tituba's role in the 1692 Salem witch trials. Argues that much of the 'Tituba myth" originated in nineteenth- and twen- tieth-century fictional narratives. Maintains that there is little, if any, evidence that Tituba was a Barbadian or an African. Con- tends that scholars' constructions of Tituba parallel society's contructions of race. Wobeck, Marianne S. "Capitalizing on Hope: Transporting German Emigrants across the Atlantic before the American Revolution." Amerikastudien 42 (1997): 345-56. Stud- ies a shift in the indentured servitude sys- tem during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Argues that during the seven- teenth century most German migrants who came to the American colonies as bound laborers were young men. Shows that dur- ing the eighteenth century the flow of Ger- man immigrants brought a significant por- tion of families. Contends that German- speaking migrants with limited resources embraced the opportunity of i indentured servitude not only as a financing mecha- nism but also as an effective means for becoming initiated into the culture of the colonies. SISTER ARTS Howell-Meri, Mark A. "Davies' Bear-Bait- ing Ring, 1 663: The Hope Restored?" The- atre Notebook 52 (1998): 2-7. Discusses the architecture of Thomas Davies's bear- baiting ring. Describes a picture taken from John Leake's "Exact Surveigh of the Streets Lanes Churches contained within the Ruines of the City of London" that shows Davies's ring. Presents the picture as an accurate depiction of the amphitheatre for specialists to interpret. Quotes verbatim Pepys's account of a bear fight and a fight 129</page><page sequence="34">between two men that took place in this ring. Concludes that the amphitheatre de- veloped architecturally from the 1594 Swan and the 1614 second Globe theaters but that Davies' s double-gabled "hut/roof' was not designed to hold stage-flying ma- chinery because the ring was never used for plays. Radice, Mark A. "Sites for Music in Purcell's Dorset Garden Theatre." The Musical Quarterly 81 (1997): 430-48. Surveys the use of music in "semi-operas" staged in the Dorset Garden Theatre between 1671 and 1701 with particular attention to the ways in which the theater's space was used to accommodate an increasingly larger or- chestra. Discusses the practical and aes- thetic considerations in placing the musi- cians. Concludes that the Dorset Garden Theatre afforded performance spaces for musicians on stage, in the music room above the procenium arch, in the balconies above the stage doors, in the substage area, in the scenic stage, the inner stage, the deep inner stage, and in a continental-style pit in front of the stage. Figures mentioned or discussed include Charles II, Sir William Davenant, Dryden, Duffett, Settle, Shadwell, and Wren. Thurley, Simon. "The Lost Palace of Whitehall." History Today 48. 1 ( 1 998): 47- 52. Provides a history of the buildings of Whitehall and their political significance in English history. Contends that the de- struction of the palace due to fire in Janu- ary 1 698 had an immediate and far-reach- ing impact in England: until George III built Buckingham Palace in the 1 820s, the Brit- ish monarch was without "a principal resi- dence of any scale or grandeur." Includes suggestions for further reading. Figures mentioned or discussed include Charles II, Buckingham, Danby, James II, Mary II, Monmouth, and William III. Tudor-Craig, Pamela. "Times and Tides." History Today 48.5 ( 1 998): 8- 1 0. Describes an image of the profile of Christ without a halo that was part of an altarpiece in Whitehall Palace created for James II in 1686. Contends that contemporaries ob- jected to the image since it was associated with Catholic iconography that had reached England in 1555. Also discusses a similar image identified with Charles I, a profile of Christ carved and painted on a plum stone. 130</page></plain_text>
