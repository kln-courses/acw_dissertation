<plain_text><page sequence="1">How Things Happen: Divine-Natural Law in Spinoza By RICHARD MASON (CAMBRIDGE) Hüten wir uns, zu sagen, dass es Gesetze in der Natur gebe. Es giebt nur Nothwendigkei- ten: da ist Keiner, der befiehlt, Keiner, der gehorcht, Keiner, der übertritt. Wenn ihr wisst, dass es keine Zwecke giebt, so wisst ihr auch, dass es keinen Zufall giebt: denn nur neben einer Welt von Zwecken hat das Wort , Zufall' einen Sinn. (F. Nietzsche, Die fröhliche Wissenschaft, 109) Zusammenfassung Niemand bezweifelt, daß nach Spinoza der Lauf der Dinge nicht auf übernatürliche Weise, d. h. durch irgend etwas außerhalb der Natur erklärt werden kann. Aber weniger klar ist, wie radikal seine Sicht der Naturgesetze zu verstehen ist und wie sein Erklärungsapparat arbeiten soll. Können wir zum Beispiel von einem göttlichen Gesetzgeber absehen und doch die Naturgesetze als herrschende Regeln akzeptieren - vielleicht in Verbindung mit den unendlichen Modi? Dieser Aufsatz legt eine andere Sicht dar. Spinoza schrieb von »Gesetzen oder der Natur'. Nicht Gesetze sind es für ihn, die die Dinge geschehen lassen, sondern Ursachen; sie sollten somit bei der Erklärung, warum etwas geschieht, Berücksichtigung finden. Von Naturgesetzen können wir sprechen, sofern wir nicht der Vorstellung erliegen, sie seien getrennt vom Lauf der Dinge. Spinozas Position legt nahe, daß es auf das ankommt, was in der Natur geschieht: Fragen zum Status der Gesetze und ihrer Beziehung zu Dingen und Ereignissen sollten sich folglich nicht mehr stellen. I No one has ever doubted that Spinoza argued for the immanent causality of God: "God is the immanent, not the transitive, cause of all things"1. How things happen is not to be explained supernaturally, by anything outside nature, but within it. In the Theological-Political Treatise, and to some extent in the Political Treatise - but scarcely at all in the Ethics - we hear about divine laws or natural laws. And it is plain, given Spinoza's identification of God with nature, that these are identified with each other: the laws of God are the laws of nature, "the universal laws of Nature according to which all things happen and are deter- 1 Ethica (E) 1 "Propositio" (P) 18; Spinoza: Opera, ed. by C.

Although it is obvious, I hope, that divine will and natural law are meant to be the same - divine law is naturalised, removing from physics any need to mention God, even in prefatory passing - it is far less obvious how divine or natural law is to be understood, and what its status is supposed to be, within Spinoza's ontology. There is an odd contrast here - although I guess the oddness is just striking, rather than significant - in the juxtaposition of some of the most evident, least contentious elements in the interpretation of Spinoza with some of his most difficult and controversial passages. To mention only three of these - all the subject of massive commentary and footnoting - the section on the "fixed and eternal things"3 in the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, the appearance of "proximate causality" in Ethics 1, Proposition 28, Scholium, and the place of the infinite modes. So what is natural law, and how can it fit into Spinoza's world? In asking this we have to look into the nucleus of his system - almost its particle physics, as it were - at the glue or mechanism that holds it together. This makes the subject abstract but, I think, important - or so at least it seems from the bold declaration of the centrality of natural law in the Preface to Part 3 of the Ethics: "our approach to the understanding of the nature of things of every kind should [...] be one and the same; namely, through the universal laws and rules of Nature"4. Such a belief looks like part of Spinoza's grounding for an ideology of natural science. He goes on in the same passage to say that the emotions, the mind and human actions must be accessible to the same methods as plane and solid geometry. In the Political Treatise he tells us that politics can be approa- ched in the same spirit as mathematics, human passions along the same lines as meteorology5. And he relies on an identification of divine with natural law in his case against the possibility of miracles in Chapter 6 of the Theological- Political Treatise: one of the areas where the underlying metaphysics shows most clearly through the surface of the carefully -crafted rhetoric. II My case will be that we can easily underestimate Spinoza's immanentism, despite all he tells us: we can tend to fall into seeing natural law as being somehow outside the order of nature, explaining what takes place within it. 2 Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; SO 3, 46, quoted from Baruch Spinoza.

One is to believe that much light can be shed by reference to logic. This belief is expressed, though hardly in such overt terms, by Yirmiyahu Yovel in his exhaustive paper The Infinite Mode and Natural Laws in Spinoza. All necessity for Spinoza, according to Yovel, "is inherently logical". Particular modes are "determined by logical necessity". The type of causality exercised by the laws of nature "is logical rather than mechanical". And we learn that a law is "generated in nature by immanent logical derivation". God expresses his logi- cal necessity and so on6. Since Spinoza barely mentions logic, and then only somewhat dismissively, as a boring branch of mental hygiene7, this seems to place a lot of interpretation on a rather slender base. More seriously, there is nowhere at all in his work where we see any discussion of the nature or status of logical truths, described as such. So to explain natural law in terms of logic must leave us asking how he saw logic; and since he did not tell us that, the trail of exegesis would seem to be a short and unprofitable one. (And all this is quite aside from a line of Leibnizian thinking starting from the question: Does God have to think logically?) A second view of natural law in Spinoza I find equally unhelpful. Edwin Curley finds it wholly evident - indeed hardly worth mentioning - that Spinoza conceived that the laws of nature have "the kind of logical form we nowadays think of laws as having, that is, as generalisations which state the conditions under which change occurs in nature"8. Curley sees natural law in terms of nomological generalisations9. Both Yovel and Curley, I would argue, may not appreciate the compactness or density of Spinoza's immanentism. To appeal to logic, or to go on as if "logical necessity" could explain anything is to step beyond nature almost as much as to appeal to the ignorantiae asylum itself. A similar argument can be used about natural laws as generalisations which are supposed to explain individual things or events: I will return to this later. Yovel and Curley share a belief that natural laws need to be understood in relation to what Spinoza said about infinite modes. For Yovel, "the law-like patterns of nature are modes - infinite modes - in which God himself exists and manifests his essence"10. The face of the whole universe - "facies totius 6 Y.

To Curley, the "fixed and eternal things" in the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect "survive in the Ethics as the attributes and infinite modes" and as such are "whatever it is in reality which corresponds to the laws of nature"13. Ill Spinoza's most helpful-looking remarks on natural law appear in the Theo- logical-Political Treatise', although one has to say that their helpfulness is limited. There, at the opening of Chapter 4, we get what seems to be more or less a nominal definition of law: "The word law, taken in its absolute sense, means that according to which each individual thing - either all in general or those of the same kind - act in one and the same fixed and determinate manner". This fixed and determinate manner either depends on human choice or is a matter of the necessity of nature, and then, "A law which depends on Nature's necessity is one which necessarily follows from the very nature of the thing, that is, its definition"14. In Chapter 6 we read, not surprisingly, that "Nature [...] always observes laws and rules involving eternal necessity and truth although these are not always known to us, and thus it also observes a fixed and immutable order"15. All this is reminiscent of Part 1 of the Ethics (written, it is usually agreed, before it), where the mechanics of natural causality are anatomised. There, though, laws as such are less prominent. At the end of the long Scholium to Proposition 15, we find that "all things [...] are in God, and all things that come to pass do so only through the laws of God's infinite nature and follow through the necessity of his essence"16; and the Demonstration to Proposition 17 tells us briskly that infinite things follow absolutely "solely from the necessity of divine nature, or - which is the same thing - solely from the laws of that same nature"17). The movement of Spinoza's thinking looks as though he wants to rely on the equivalence of the laws of nature to the necessity of (the) divine nature, but prefers to argue in terms of necessity - about which he says a good deal - rather than law - which he scarcely mentions explicitly at all. Possibly this is a rhetorical choice, of more than rhetorical significance - like his often- noted preference for writing about God, not nature, despite the undoubted identity of the terms. Or possibly there is more to it than rhetoric, and the 1 1 "Epistola" (Ep) 64; SO 4, 278. 12 Yovel (see note 6), p. 88. 13 Curley (see note 8), pp. 124, 123. 14 SO 3, 57; Shirley 1989, p. 101. 15 SO J, öJ; sniriey ivöv, p. izo. 16 SO 2, 60; Shirley 1992, p. 43. 17 SO 2, 61; Shirley 1992, p. 44.</page><page sequence="5">How Things Happen: Divine-Natural Law in Spinoza 21 emphasis is meant to be reductive: the laws of God's nature are only to be seen in terms of necessity, so let's just think about that. (And another reductive- looking reference is in Letter 32, where laws are equated to a coherence of parts in a whole, and "nihil aliud intelligo"18). The opening passage on law in Chapter 4 of the Theological-Political Treatise ends in a cryptic comment about law "absolute considerata". Spinoza is writing about laws which depend on human choice, but his conclusions then seem to widen without warning (or if they do not, it is hard to see how he could be writing about laws "absolute considerata"): "We ought to define and explain things through their proximate causes. Generalisations about fate and the interconnection of causes can be of no service to us in forming and ordering our thoughts concerning particular things. Furthermore, we plainly have no knowledge as to the actual co-ordination and interconnection of things - that is, the way in which things are in actual fact ordered and connected - so that for practical purposes it is better, indeed, it is essential, to consider things as contingent. So much for law taken in the absolute sense"19. Here, it is unclear how far our lack of knowledge is meant to go. One conclusion might be that law considered absolutely is beyond our grasp, and we might do better, perhaps, to attend to the experienced order of things and events. Another conclusion might be that what we think to be laws - or our best attempts at formulating them - are only really a "universalis consideratio de fato, &amp; concatenatione causarum"20. That sort of scepticism, though, would seem hard to square with the epistemological confidence of Part 2 of the Ethics (Part 2, Proposition 38 or 47, for example). One possibility, which we lack the evidence to substantiate, is that trying to appeal to laws in our understanding of nature, where our knowledge may be necessarily incomplete, is to use what Spinoza calls "transcendental terms"21 to cover our ignorance, as when some- one appeals to the power of God instead of looking for a natural cause. (Further contrasts are offered between correct and incorrect forms of explanation: In the Preface to Ethics Part 4, where referring individuals to a genus as a method of explanation is contrasted unfavourably to explanation by efficient causes; or in Letter 6 (of 1662), where there is a contrast between 'pure notions'22 which explain nature as it is in itself - such as motion and rest and their laws - and perceptible qualities. At any rate, what is certain is that the explanation of things through their proximate causes is the ideal. Whether explanations by means of laws "consid- ered absolutely" are beyond us in principle, or whether we are just likely to be poor at formulating such laws, it may be that the production of laws is secon- 18 SO 4, 170. 19 SO 3, 58; Shirley 1989, pp. 101-102. 20 SO 3, 58. 21 SO 3, 28; Shirley 1989, p. 71.

The priority of explanation by proximate causes should be evident, too, from the difficult propositions in the Ethics on the causality of individual things (Part 1, Proposition 28) and ideas (2, Proposition 9). The cause of each indivi- dual can only be an infinite chain or net of other individuals. In one sense, Spinoza seems much clearer than some of his commentators that we can never really understand the full reasons why individual events happen or things exist. The net of such reasons will always be infinite, and therefore beyond our grasp in principle24. This has disturbed some commentators for two interlocking reasons. First, it may seem that we are able to give sufficient, finite explanations why some things exist and some events happen; for example when appealing to a covering law and to other particulars. Why was I born? Look at the laws of biology and the existence of my parents. Secondly - and it would seem, conveniently - there is the presence of the "fixed and eternal things" in the Treatise on the Emenda- tion of the Intellect, which might (or might not) be the same as the infinite modes of the Ethics. Wheeled in where they are, they seem ideal candidates for the role of explanatory laws. In the Treatise on the Emendation of the intellect, for instance, they appear immediately after we are told that human weakness makes it impossible for us to grasp a series of finite things25. IV Curley, more coherently than any other expositor, links our alleged need for general explanatory laws with the presence of the infinite modes, producing a tidy exegetical theory: "The finite modes follow from, are deducible from, a finite series of infinite causes, the laws of nature, taken in conjunction with an infinite series of finite causes, the other, prior finite modes. That is, the finite modes follow from God's attributes (via the infinite modes), but do not follow from God's nature absolutely, only conditionally"26. All this is much clearer than Spinoza himself: but at some cost. A cost, for example, of directly contradicting what is said so painfully and so explicitly in Ethics 1, Proposition 28, Proof (and 2, Proposition 9): "That which is finite and has a determinate existence [...] must have followed, or been determined to exist and to act, by God or one of his attributes in so far as it was modified by a modification which is finite and has a determined existence"27.

The determination, we note is mutual (ab invicem). We note, too, and surely awkwardly for Curley, the hinting reference to an infinite mode29 in a strikingly non-causal role: all bodies mutually determined to exist and act "while there is preserved in all together, that is, in the whole universe, the same proportion of motion and rest". Spinoza may have changed his mind after writing this letter, or he may not have written it with the same care with which he finalised the Ethics, but what he says in it does create serious difficulties for Curley 's reading. Against Curley, I would argue that Spinoza neither wanted nor needed a covering-law model for individual causality, and that infinite modes play no direct part in either the causality of individuals or in our understanding of natural law. These points can be taken in order. First, that Spinoza did not want a covering-law model we can see from the passages just quoted. Whatever we may think of it, he seems to have believed that the cause of an individual's existence, or of an individual event, could consist of a set of other individuals or events. His cast of thought was relent- lessly non-factual and non-propositional, resisting transcription into logicised forms amenable to assessment in terms of truth or necessary truth30. This is certainly strange, but not fatally so. There is at least one view of causality in which Spinoza would have needed nothing else - a view, for instance, like that of Nancy Cartwright in her Nature 's Capacities and their Measurement whereby "singular facts are not reducible to generic ones, but exactly the opposite: singular causal facts are basic" or "to assert the causal law that aspirins relieve headaches is to claim that aspirins, by virtue of being aspirins, have the capacity to make headaches disappear. A single successful case is significant, since that guarantees that the causal factor has the capacity it needs to bring about the effect"31 and "we need some concept of singular causing already if we are to talk about causal laws"32. Cartwright's language is not Spinoza's - he thinks of singular things or events, not facts - but her view of the primacy and concreteness of singular causality over general statements is not out of line with his view of the causality of finite modes. 28 SO 4, 172, quoted from The Correspondence of Spinoza, transi, by A.

Why does so-and-so happen? What makes it happen? For Spinoza these two questions will be the same. What makes a thing exist or an event happen for him will be what existed or happened before. To cite the causes will be to give the explanation. Only if we read this in propositional terms33 does it lead to the alleged trap of Explanatory rationalism', making all true propositions necessa- rily true, and so on. The exclusion of infinite modes from the causality of individuals is conten- tious34. The logical side of the argument is, I believe, clear-cut. The textual side is quite the opposite. Logically, there is an unbridgeable causal-explanatory gap between the infinite modes and the acting and existence of finite individuals. Spinoza seems to rub this in with the mechanical pedantry of Ethics Part 1, Propositions 21, 22 and 28. Curley rightly reminds us that a distinction is introduced between following unconditionally or absolutely, and being determined: "The infinite modes follow unconditionally from God's attributes. Finite modes follow from God's attributes only as those attributes are affected with some other finite mode [...]"35. But this still does nothing to bridge the gap between infinite and finite. One of the clearest uses of infinite modes in the Ethics is in 5, Proposition 40, Corollary, Scholium - where Spinoza refers back to Part 1, Proposition 21 ("All things that follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must have existed always, and as infinite; that is, through the said attribute they are eternal and infinite"36) - and where he tells us that "Our mind, in so far as it understands, is an eternal mode of thinking which is determined by another mode of thinking, and this again by another, and so on ad infinitum, with the result that they all together constitute the eternal and infinite intellect of God"37. The infinite intellect is, we know from Letter 64, an example of an infinite mode38. We can see here that it is made up of other modes. The relationship is, apparently, constitutive rather than causal39. 33 As Bennett does, for example: see J. F. Bennett: A Study of Spinoza's Ethics, Cambridge 1984, ch. 2.8 and 5. In response, see A. Donagan: Spinoza, New York 1988, pp. 73-75. Davidson reminds us that "it is sentences (or statements or propositions), or the relations between them, that are properly classified as contingent or logical; if causal relations are 'in nature', it makes no sense to classify them as logical or contingent" (D. Davidson: Reply to P. F. Strawson, in: B. Vermazen and M. Hintikka (eds.): Essays on Davidson, Oxford 1985, p. 224). I will return later to this unlikely source of support. 34 See J. Friedman: How the Finite Follows from the Infinite in Spinoza s Metaphysical System, in: Synthèse 69, 3 (1986), pp. 371-407. His assumptions are directly the opposite of mine; see my Spinoza on the Causality of Individuals, in: Journal of the History of Philosophy 24, 2 (1986), pp. 197-210. 35 Curley (see note 8), p. 124nl3. 36 SO 2, 65; Shirley 1992, p. 47. 37 SO 2, 306; Shirley 1992, p. 224; see also E 2 "Axioma" i "Lemma (Lj /ò; au z, iuz. 38 See SO 4, 278. 39 The sense of constitution in Spinoza has been the subject ot much deoate, mostly m connection with attributes and substance: see Curley (see note 3), p. 416n24.</page><page sequence="9">How Things Happen: Divine-Natural Law in Spinoza 25 Nothing much else is clear, though. It is here that we enter some of the most densely-footnoted areas of Spinoza's texts. Two of these may seem particularly relevant - the Scholia to Ethics 1, Proposition 28 and the passage on the fixed and eternal things in the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect. Ethics 1, Proposition 28, Scholium is a swamp of obliqueness40. The first part of the Scholium tells us that God is the "causa absolute próxima" of things immediately produced by God. The second part tells us that God cannot properly be called a remote cause of singular things "unless perchance for the purpose of distinguishing these things from things which he has produced directly, or rather, things which follow from his absolute nature"41. No one questions that at least some, if not all, infinite modes, are supposed to follow from the absolute nature of God (after Part 1, Proposition 21), whatever that means. In contrast, singular things do not follow from the absolute nature of God, although we should not forget that "all things that are, are in God, and depend on God in such a way that they can neither be nor be conceived without him"42. What this Scholium does not tell us is that infinite modes are causally linked to finite modes. All modes, as natura naturata, ("omnes Dei attributorum modos" in Part 2, Proposition 29, Scholium) are "in" and depend on God. The infinite modes follow "absolutely"43. We may conclude rightly that the finite modes do not follow absolutely; but not that the finite modes follow from the infinite. This may or may not be suggested by the Short Treatise, where particular modes ("bezondere wyzen") consist in "all the particular things which are caused by the general [or universal] modes" ("alle die bezondere dingen de welke van de algemeene wyze veroorzaakt werden")44. Since the distinction between general and particular, with good reason, vanishes from the Ethics45, 1 think we may conclude that Spinoza thought again about the line of causation sketched in his earlier work. The second difficult text takes us to the series of fixed and eternal things46. Here, we learn that the causae proximae, of all things (which "will be to us like universais, or genera of the definitions of singular, changeable things"47) are fixed and eternal. In my view, we must regard this as Spinoza's opinion before his thinking had crystallised fully. Distinctions between the general and the particular could play no causal role in the Ethics where, we have seen, it is wholly explicit that singular effects must have only singular determinants. 40 Why? Commentators do not ask this. Was this a weak spot for Spinoza? Was he unsure here? Had he changed his mind, or not settled his view? The failure of his usual lucidity is interesting in itself. 41 SO 2, 70; Shirley 1992, p. 51 42 Ibid. 43 SO 2, 71; Shirley 1992, p. 52. 44 Korte Verhandeling; SO 1,47; my translation.

Donagan did not48. Yovel does, ascribing to them an impressive versati- lity of roles and properties. They provide "the metaphysical category, the source and paradigm of natural laws". They are "infinite and universal", but also less general, for they spell out the supreme law of nature in a series of ever more specific laws. The laws of nature are "inscribed" in them. They are "singular entities that perform a universal function". An infinite mode can be seen as a "totality as a singular entity with universal features, each of which, as sub-totality, is again a singular entity"49. Some of this just cannot be correct, although that is not directly relevant to my argument now. Spinoza distinguished carefully, and rightly, for example, in Letter 81, between the notion of a totality or an aggregate and any kind of infinity. (This is one of his most important, and most overlooked, arguments.) And the view of universais ascribed to Spinoza by Yovel sounds alarmingly similar to the one later ridiculed beyond redemption by Berkeley (who invites us sarcastically to have a general idea of a triangle which is "neither oblique, nor rectangle, equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once"50). Yet it does not seem that Yovel' s aim is to suggest that Spinoza held a view that is patently untenable. (We may ask, too, whether any metaphysical entity could solve as many problems at once. It is surely only the uncertainties in Spinoza's expositions of infinite modes that allow them such apparently remarkable versatility.) V My own view is that infinite modes should not be relevant to a discussion of Spinoza on natural law; but it would be evasive not to say at least something positive about how they should be viewed. The best guidance - apart from what we must take to be the authoritative passages in Ethics 1 - is in Letter 12 of 1663: the Letter on the Infinite. This shows some discordances with his final position, but at least it also shows us some views which he repudiated explicit- ly. He knows that he needs to allow for periods of finite duration and for divisibility - neither of which can be ascribed to nature conceived as substance. But "[...] we can at will determine the existence and duration of Modes, and conceive it as greater or less, and divide it into parts, when, as most frequently happens, we are considering their essence and not the order of Nature. Indeed we can do so without thereby in any way destroying the conception which we have of them"51. 48 See Donagan (see note 33), pp. 51-52. 49 Yovel (see note 6), pp. 84-85. 50 G.

He needs them to allow for the possibility of things which, in his terms, he has concluded, "omnem numerum superant"52. Each individual thing is determined by others to a certain mode of existence - "each particular thing is determined by another particular thing to exist in a certain manner"53. But if we do consider nature - nature-as-extension, for example - as an infinity - we may also be thinking of "the very existence of particular things so far as they are in God" or of "the very nature of exist- ence"54. Spinoza needs this result in the crucial propositions that allow for the possibility of the natural sciences, leading up to his extraordinary assertion that "The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God"55. He needs to be able to see reality, to present some things like this: "some [...] are [infinite] in virtue of the cause on which they depend, yet when they are considered abstractly, they can be divided into parts and viewed as finite"56. The infinite modes allow for science in so far as it can deliver results about unlimited quantities of particular things. To which it might be objected immediately: so there must be some link with natural law, because if science contains laws and science deals with infinite modes (among other things), then natural laws must be connected to infinite modes. This is a view taken by Curley57, not wholly surprisingly, given Spinoza's gnomic early comments about his fixed and eternal things and the "laws inscribed in these things, as in their true codes, according to which all singular things come to be, and are ordered"58. Maybe that sort of objection is correct for Spinoza's early thinking, but we can be less confident about his more mature thinking in the Ethics, and his more mature and oblique expression in the Theological-Political Treatise. It must be correct, I guess, that natural laws, if allegedly covering everything - nature conceived under an attribute - should relate to infinite modes, and should relate to finite modes as well, of course. But unfortunately, 'relate' and 'cover' here are helpfully but lethally vague. We are still left with two areas of embar- rassment: the gap between the infinite and the finite - if we wish to insist that there must be some causal link between the two - discussed already; and the status of laws, if they are said to be about infinite modes. What are laws? Linguistic or theoretical constructions used to refer to existing entities? Thou- ghts? Sets of propositions? Yovel gets round all this, I think we must conclude, by a certain flexibility of language. He tells us, for instance, that "Laws are [...] the intermediary entities that embody God's power, presence and immanent causality in the 52 SO 4, 59. 53 E 2P45S; Shirley 1992, p. 94. 54 SO 2, 127; Shirley 1992, p. 94. 55 E 2P47; Shirley 1992, p. 95. 56 SO 4, 6 1 ; Wolf (see note 28), p. 1 2 1 . 57 Curley (see note 26), pp. 45-50. 58 SO 2, 37; Curley (see note 3), p. 41.</page><page sequence="12">28 Richard Mason world, and that transmit his necessity to all there is"59. This may contain illuminating insights, but the modern reader may wonder whether more can be done to shed light in this obscurity than by referring to laws as "entities". Curley grasps the nettle firmly. For him, Spinoza's nature is "not conceived as the totality of things, but conceived as the most general principles of order exemplified by things"60. If we can raise questions about the status of the laws of nature and how they relate to nature, this approach resolves them in the most drastic way. The laws of nature are part of nature, not "about" it; and actual things then become something different: "Better to identify God himself with those most general principles of order described by the fundamental laws of nature. It is in this sense that Spinoza does not separate God from nature; he does not identify God with nature where nature is conceived simply as the totality of finite things"61. This radical solution is linked to Curley' s logical-factual-propositional reading of Spinoza, which it would go wider than this paper to consider properly. But one wishes one could find the confidence to feel that logic, facts and propositions - while sounding more a part of the Twentieth Century than "things [...] determined [...] to exist and to act"62 - had any solid explanatory force. It might be possible, as Curley tells us, to explain to Spinoza in less than five minutes what is meant by "nomological facts"63. The problem, though, is that maybe Spinoza could demonstrate to Curley in even less than five minutes what was meant by 'res singularis'. And some things - whatever they are - are more solid than any facts, as well as being simpler to explain: here is a brick, for example. The fact that it causes pain when dropped on my toe is something entertained with less force and directness than the pain caused by the brick on my toe. Of which am I more certain that it exists? The pain or the fact of the pain? Naturally, this is not to suggest that laws are not "about" infinite modes, whatever they are: it is just to say that such a view leaves too much unsaid and too much not explained. VI So what are natural laws for Spinoza? We can see the answer, I think, in what Bennett (though not on this topic) calls Spinoza's "conceptual minima- lism"64. We can go back to what we were told directly in Ethics 1, Proposition 59 Yovel (see note 6), p. 94. 60 Curley (see note 26), p. 42. 61 E. M. Curley: A Spinoza Reader, Princeton 1994, p.

As often, Spinoza's preference is for a kind of definition-in-use when it comes to central terms - "We have [...] shown that an infinity of things follow, absolutely, solely from the necessity of divine nature, or - which is the same thing - solely from the laws of that same nature"65. The necessity of nature is the same as the laws of nature. If we take that seriously and literally it looks wrong: how can necessity - which we might consider to be a modal property - be the same as laws? (And in Letter 32 (of 1665), equally strangely, we read of "leges, sive natura [...] [leges] sive naturae"66. Even grammatically, in Latin or English, this sounds odd.) We search in vain for helpful examples of natural laws in the Ethics. Where we might most expect to find some clarification, we see nothing of the sort. Introducing the Axioms, Lemmas and Postulates at the beginning of Part 2, Spinoza describes them unhelpfully only as "pauca de natura corporum"67 - a few things about the nature of bodies. Surely here, if he had been thinking of laws, he could have said so? Elsewhere, too, he is typically terse: we hear of the laws of motion and rest and the law that someone will strive to benefit someone they love68. These references are even less explicit than what is said in Part 1: "All things [...] are in God, and all things that come to pass do so only through the laws of God's infinite nature and follow through the necessity of his essence"69. We need to go to the Theological-Political Treatise to find reliable, overt- ly-stated examples. We read of a "universal law governing all bodies"70 where- by "all bodies colliding with smaller bodies lose as much of their own motion as they impart to other bodies". This "follows from Nature's necessity". Also, we see a law which follows by necessity from human nature where "a man, in remembering one thing, forthwith calls to mind another like it, or which he has seen along with it". And these are both examples which are said to follow "from the very nature of the thing, that is, its definition"71. Evidently, Spinoza had no illusions about the anthropomorphic metaphor in the notion of law72. The brunt of his cases against miracles and against final causes, uncontroversially, is that nature is not directed by an external God, like a king or a law-giver73. But I think we need to take this much further. The law or laws of nature are how it acts, not something outside nature that explains its actions. This, surely, is the sense of the declaration in the Preface to Ethics Part 65 SO 2, 61; Shirley 1992, p. 44. 66 SO 4, 170. 67 SO 2, 97. 68 See E 2P2S; SO 2, 144 and E 3P39. 69 E 1P15S; SO 2, 60; Shirley 1992, p. 43. 70 SO 3, 57; Shirley (1989, p. 101) has added "governing" - an interesting change. 71 SO 3, 57-58; Shirley 1989, p. 101. 72 See SO 3, 58. 73 The links between the idea of law and the existence or a lawgiver had been explored exhaustively in Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologiae la 2ae, 90, 91, 93.</page><page sequence="14">30 Richard Mason 3, quoted earlier: "our approach to the understanding of the nature of things of every kind should [...] be one and the same; namely, through the universal laws and rules of nature". The "laws and rules according to which all things happen" here are said to be the same as "the force and power of acting"74 of nature. Once again, we note, laws are likened or equated not to something said about nature, or some set of ("nomological") facts related to it, but are the force and power of nature. "Conceptual minimalism" is not a bad label for the implosion of Spinoza's terminology. For the existence of a thing or the occurrence of an event to be necessary is for it to have a cause75. It is basic to nature that everything is like that. The caused existence of things is their law-boundness. To exist or act in a law-ordered way is not to be bound by anything separate from things or events. Even to say that it is just 'how they are' or 'how they act' would, I suggest, be to get outside the tightness of Spinoza's immanentism. Consider, for example, the extraordinarily claustrophobic compression of thought which appears at times: "[...] the eternal and infinite being, whom we call God, or Nature, acts by the same necessity whereby it exists. That the necessity of his nature whereby he acts is the same as that whereby he exists has been demonstrated (Prop. 16,1). So the reason or cause why God, or Nature, acts, and the reason or cause why he exists, are one and the same"76. Equally, the intelligibility of nature - in his view, the guarantee that we must be able to understand it - is the same thing as nature's caused existence and action. For a thing or event to be unintelligible would be for it to lack a cause, to be disconnected from the order of nature77. I have mentioned that the paradigm of explanation or definition for Spinoza is through proximate causes78. He wishes, ironically, that Descartes had troub- led to explain the union of the mind and body through its proximate cause79. As we have also seen, beyond there we find a suggestion that generalisations may not be too helpful, or perhaps even be possible: "Generalisations about fate and the interconnection of causes can be of no service to us in forming and ordering 74 SO 2, 138; Shirley 1992, p. 103. 75 An interesting comparison. "A thing is necessary if it is taken not simply in and by itself, but by virtue of something else. Necessity carries with it the idea of mediation, of dependency, of inadequacy to maintain an isolated position and to stand and act alone and self-supported. A thing is not necessary when it simply is; it is necessary when it is, or is said to be, because of something else" (F. H. Bradley: Principles of Logic, Oxford 21922, p. 199). 76 E 4Praef; SO 2, 206; Shirley 1992, p. 154. 77 The links between the unity of nature, causality and explanation are discussed by P.

How things happen may always be beyond us, in that infinite chains and branches of causes can never be grasped. To know how the parts of nature really relate to each other would require a knowledge of the whole of nature and of all its parts81. So much for the existence of singular things and the occurrence of events. There is also our knowledge of essences. In the present context, the contrast in Spinoza's treatments of individuals and of essences appears most markedly in Ethics 2, Proposition 45, Scholium82. There, he distinguishes between the determination of each singular thing by other singular things - the determinati- on of Ethics 1, Proposition 28 - and the "very existence of particular things in so far as they are in God": the "very nature of existence"83. We see that this - not infinite modes - is the foundation for scientific knowledge. It is from the knowledge of "God's infinite essence and his eternity" that "we can deduce a great many things so as to know them adequately"84. The "force by which each [thing] perseveres in existing"85 looks very like its conatus, or actual essence, "with which each thing endeavours to persist in its own being"86. The propositions at the end of Part 2 of the Ethics show how we know about essences. Spinoza's view is a radical one: not only is scientific knowledge possible - scepticism is not admitted - but it is in some sense necessary. Part 2, Proposition 47, Scholium: "God's infinite essence and his eternity are known to all"87, translated badly into modern terms might mean something like: it would be impossible for us not to know about nature. VII Yet about natural law in specific relation to essences we see almost nothing: nothing on the status of laws, nothing on the connection between universal law and its particular application - no philosophy of science, as it were. Why? The general assertion of natural law - Ethics 1, Proposition 17 - "God acts solely from the laws of his own nature, constrained by none"88 - should put us on warning about the reason for this silence. Following from divine nature is the same thing as following by the laws of nature, by the necessity of nature. To hypostatise law - I surmise - for Spinoza - would be to set up another idol outside the order of nature. That unfortunate tendency of thought could not be 80 SO 3, 58; Shirley 1989, p. 102. 81 See Ep 32; SO 4, 170. 82 See on this D.

Although Yovel goes on to assure us that such causality is "logical rather than mechanical"89, what he says is surely just what Spinoza could not mean. The whole point would surely be that making things behave in contrast to showing how they behave is a great mistake90. Spinoza might, I think, have felt some sympathy for the opinion of Suárez: "[...] the efficacy of divine power, and the natural necessity resulting therefrom in this connexion, are metaphorically given the name of law [...] it is in accordance with this acceptation that the term 'law' is wont to be applied to natural inclination; either because that inclination is the measure of the action toward which it impels one, or because it rises out of the law of the Creator. For this term 'law' is frequently applied both to the rule itself, and to the work or effect thereof, in so far as the latter conforms to the rule; just as the actual product of art is often called 'art'"91. It is easy to forget that the main stress of Spinoza's chapter on Divine Law in the Theological-Political Treatise is theologically negative. The intention is to counteract the idea of law being given by God, either to nature, or to humans for their moral improvement. So much is undeniable. Yet the full ramifications seem to have caused a lot of trouble for commentators. If law is not given to nature, maybe it is still part of nature, or a rule that nature must obey, or is inscribed in important aspects of nature? Spinoza said enough to allow for all these readings, but his consistent position was surely more thoroughgoing: "we acquire a greater and more perfect knowledge of God as we gain more knowl- edge of natural phenomena [...] the greater our knowledge of natural phenome- na, the more perfect is our knowledge of God's essence, which is the cause of all things"92. So: to know about how nature works is to know about the essence of God. Our impulse, I suspect, is to imagine that more of a theory or account of scientific or natural law must be extractable from Spinoza. But I doubt if it is, and will try to explain why. His understanding of the actual working of nature is inherently non-theore- tical. The causes or determinants of an individual's existence, or of an individu- al event, are other individuals. To catalogue them, apparently, is to explain what exists or happens by describing it exactly. Again, the necessity in what exists or happens is certainly not 'explained' by logic. In fact it is, literally, not explained by anything. To have a cause is to be explained is to be necessary. 89 Yovel (see note 6), p. 93. 90 See Yovel (see note 6), p. 93. The Latin "secundum" - "according to , in accordance with" - is helpfully ambiguous for Spinoza; as in Letter 13, of 1663, where we read that "omnes corporum variationes secundum Leges Mechanicae fiant" (SO 4, 67). 91 F.

All of this, we have seen, applies (and may apply with reasonable plausibi- lity) to the existence of things and the occurrence of events. The citation of their proximate causes tells us why they exist or occur. Applied to essences it gives us natural science. VIII But surely - we may object - there must be more? What, after all, are laws? On the opening pages of his Law and Explanation, Peter Achinstein sweeps briskly past "some philosophers" who, he says, have failed to notice a double use of "law": "The term is used to refer both to a proposition and to a fact which that proposition descri- bes.!...] Failure to notice this double use of the term may have been at least partly responsible for the view, held by some philosophers, that laws are not the sort of things which are true or false, something that can be said only of propositions not facts"93. A gap between a proposition and "a fact which that proposition describes" does of course open the way for the kind of discussion of law which Achinstein, typically, wanted to initiate: What is the status - the logical' status - of propositional laws? How is their alleged universality and modality to be under- stood? What is their 'logical form'? How are such propositions to be related to 'reality'? None of these questions are raised, answered or even entertained by Spino- za, and so he may be judged by some to be a philosopher who missed something important. He did, I think, miss a route into this territory which was well trodden by subsequent travellers through the philosophy of science, and this may have made his approach look like an historical dead end. On the other hand, it may have been the well-trodden route that was the detour. (This, in analogy, has turned out to be the case with his attitude to cartesian doubt, an attitude which placed him within a tiny and eccentric minority for three centu- ries while the possibility of egocentric doubt worried philosophers in the mainstream.) If you treat laws as primarily propositional - and as being some- how about facts - then you do get questions about the form and force of those propositions and their connection to facts. That path is inexorable (which is not to. say that it has been productive). But what if, like Spinoza, you do not mention facts, have little interest in language and its relation to reality, apparently do not care at all about logic or logical forms, and could not even begin a discussion on the ontological status of propositions, true propositions and facts? In a way, he might go along with the distinction emphasised repeatedly by Davidson, "between reason-explanations, 93 P. Achinstein: Law and Explanation, Oxford 1971, pp. 1-2.</page><page sequence="18">34 Richard Mason which are one kind of causal explanation, and are expressed by intensional sentences, and the causal relations between events or states and other events which they imply exist, but which are not in any direct sense language-depen- dent"94. Spinoza had no interest at all in the structure of sentences as opposed to causal relations between events; and hence he might (implicitly, of course) assent to Davidson's view that they are quite different. But his view - cutting right across Davidson's distinction - may have been that the study of how things happen shows us directly why they happen. (We can perhaps see how someone might hold this view by thinking - as Spinoza often does - geometri- cally. Showing how an angle can't be trisected with a ruler and compass might also show why it can't be. That demonstration would be entirely de re, to the extent that we could not be sure which propositions, if any, might be supposed to be true, or necessarily true, or what their modal status might be supposed to be.) Recent commentators - exemplified by Yovel and, with admirable clarity, Curley - have tried to help Spinoza by refraining questions and answers for him in logical or propositional terms, thus landing him with sets of problems which his own approach had wholly avoided. His historical location has not helped in our understanding of him. Given his regard for scientific explanation and his identification of natural law with God's will, it is not hard to see him as standing at the starting-point of a "modern" conception of physical law, where God's rôle as law-giver can at best be relegated to the prefaces and pious dedications of scientific works, rather than remain a substantive problem for the contents. And that reading must be partly correct. The naturalising of scientific inquiry (including, even-handedly, for example, investigations of optics and of sacred texts) was without doubt one of his aims. Whether we think it was successfully achieved depends on how well and how widely we think he was understood in practice by his contemporaries and successors: a rather different matter. Although it is tempting to see him as a figure in the development of a modern view of natural law, in an important sense I think it is also a mistake. He may have been far more radical in his thought than those who took the laws of nature as a set of rules which might (or might not) have been decreed by God, but which were nevertheless fair game for rational, natural scientific study. Edgar Zilsel, for example, in his important paper The Genesis of the Concept of Physical Law, thought that "On the whole Spinoza has taken over the theistic concept of natural law from Descartes and has reinterpreted it in a pantheistic way [...]. Spinoza is the first author combining general metaphysical determi- nism with the modern concept of physical law"95. 94 Davidson (see note 33), p. 224. 95 E.

He does tell us that "it is only in concession to the understanding of the multitude and the defectiveness of their thought that God is described as a lawgiver or ruler"96. How thoroughly are we meant to take that? A modest view is that he was only concerned to exclude a non-immanent God. But what he says could suggest a more radical aim: to undermine what is presupposed by an image of natural law as a set of rules. There is a theological dimension here, as where we learn that the teaching of Christ "took the form of eternal truths, not prescribed laws. In this way he freed [the people] from bondage to the law, while nevertheless giving further strength and stability to the law, inscribing it deep in their hearts"97. It would be wrong, I think, to read this only in relation to moral law, or to the Jewish legal tradition. IX What makes things happen, and what may be cited to explain how and why they happen, are not laws but causes. We may think of the causal order as natural laws, as long as we do not slide into thinking of laws as different or separate from what exists or happens98. Of course it may be correct that statements of laws may or may not be true, universal or necessary; but, what- ever they are, it is not stated laws which make something exist or occur - it is a set of causes. If this is how Spinoza was thinking - and many of the texts cited in this essay do suggest something like it - he was not one of those whose view of natural law laid the foundations for the following two centuries. A view of law as propositional may have been fertile, but it may also have led to ultimately sterile questions about the relations between language (or propositions) and facts. Spinoza's possible line of thought could have been as far from that as his thought about knowledge was from any concern to refute perceptual scepticism. And, as with his approach to scepticism, it would be fruitless to claim that he was somehow right on natural law, and that a long tradition of other philoso- phers was simply misled. What he implies, I think, is that science is first about 96 SO 3, 65; Shirley 1989, p. 108. 97 Ibid. Curley has noted: "To say that the Jewish law is not the true law is to imply a knowledge of what the true law is. One way of looking at the latter part of Spinoza's Ethics is as an attempt to specify that true law" (Curley (see note 61), p. xxix). 98 See hp 32; SO 4, 17Ü. An apparent echo or this view in later Jewish thinking: ot Levinas, Albert Friedlander writes - "The traditionalist approach of the philosopher [...] places the Jew under a Law which is, in the end, service to the neighbour. The Law, it must be said, is more the ontological structure, the nature of being itself, which relates us to others. Within that structure, the human being has a special meaning which through philosophy or religion moves towards the Creator, God" (A. H. Friedlander: Riders Towards the Dawn, London 1993, p. 193).</page><page sequence="20">36 Richard Mason what happens and how it happens - how nature exists and operates. The status of what may be said about nature can be interesting, but it has to be secondary. This may be a reason why some scientists have found the philosophy of science (and even philosophy), pursued along other lines, boring or fruitless". Nature itself is more fascinating.
