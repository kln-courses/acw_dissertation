<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 INTRODUCTION At the time of writing, 1983-84 seems to have been a somewhat unsettled period for Archaeology in Greece, attention some- times distracted from normal archaeological objectives, work at times undertaken in an uncertain atmosphere. Hopefully, the underlying problems of which these feelings are sympto- matic can soon be settled amicably, leaving those concerned free once again to concentrate on their work of preserving Greece's uniquely rich cultural heritage and making it available to the general public. It is difficult to compose an evenly balanced annual account of current work in Greece; though the title of this report is 'Archaeology in Greece, 1983-84', which suggests the report- ing of events that belong to this period, such, unfortunately, is not the case. The reader will find reference here to events as long ago as 1975, which have only now become available for communication. 'Archaeology in Greece, 1983-84' in fact means 'Archaeology in Greece, accounts of which were released during 1983-84'. In addition to 'Archaeology in Greece', two other foreign reviews of Greek archaeology appear each year - the 'Chronique des fouilles et decouvertes archeologiques en Grece' in BCH, and 'News Letter from Greece' in AJA. Their shared objective is to provide their readers with an up-to-date synopsis of research and discoveries in Greece during the twelve months before their publication. The three foreign reviews publish accounts of the activities of the Foreign Schools in Greece that have been submitted to the Ministry of Culture, and have been circulated among the Foreign Schools themselves; as such they are usually published for the first time in one of the foreign reviews. For the accounts they are able to give of the work of Greek archaeologists - the work of the Greek Archaeological Service, of the Archaeological Society of Athens, of Greek University Departments of Archaeology, of Greek learned institutions and societies - they are entirely dependent upon published information and illus- trations. Further, reports of collaborative work between Greek and foreign institutions must be published in a Greek source before any reference can be made in a foreign publica- tion. These regulations are understood and carefully followed by all those who work in Greece. It follows, of course, that if Greek publications fall into arrears, the foreign reviews will inevitably be even more in arrears than those upon which they rely. While the Archaeological Society continues most promptly to publish interim reports of its field projects in its Ergon and Praktika, the Archaeological Service at the time of writing is eight years in arrears with the publication of the Chronika section of its Archaeologikon Deltion. There is thus an eight-year hiatus in reporting the chance discoveries, museum activities and rescue excavations that have taken place in the. Ephorias all over Greece, and it is for this reason that the present 'Archaeology in Greece' refers to numerous events that took place in 1975, as well as including items of informa- tion about events in the first four months of 1984. The two volumes of ADelt 30 Chronika have been printed. Through the great courtesy of the Publications Department of the Ministry of Culture, the writer was given access to these volumes in advance of distribution, and has been able to excerpt from them for what follows. It will not be easy for this lost ground to be made up without sacrifice of information or presentation. There are signs in ADelt 30 Chr that these conditions have made it difficult to maintain the normal high standard of reporting associated with this publication. Some reports are of uneven quality and the value of some is diminished - surely unnecessarily - by lack of interpretation and by inadequate chronological information. If in some directions the pace of publication remains slow, there is no corresponding slackening in the rate at which field projects are undertaken. Early in 1984 a five-year development plan for Central and S Greece was reported in the Greek Press (e.g. Eidiseis 3I.I.84); details of the plan were explained by Professor G. E. Mylonas in his annual address as Secretary- General to the Archaeological Society of Athens on April 8th. The programme has been devised on the direct initiative of the President of the Republic, Mr Constantine Karamanlis. It will be under the joint supervision of the Archaeological Society and the Ministry of Culture. It will be endowed with 300,000,000 drachmas (over Â£2,000,000). Projects that will benefit from the scheme include the restoration of the Theatre of Dionysos in Athens (with a view to its future use for dramatic performances), the building of a museum at Mycenae, the conversion of the Iliou Melathron for the use of the Numismatic Museum, excavation projects at the Idaean Cave, at Rhamnous and at Phthiotic Thebes, excavation and restora- tion work at Epidauros and Kato Zakro, publication of the more important excavations and of the doctoral dissertations of young archaeologists. Meanwhile, the earlier programme of archaeological development in N Greece, to which the President of the Republic has also given his support, and in which he takes close personal interest, has continued to pursue its objectives in the excavations at Dion, Vergina, Pella, Amphipolis, Abdera and Maroneia. The galleries in the Archaeological Museum at Thessaloniki in which are displayed the finds from the Archaic cemetery of Sindos, from the Macedonian royal cemetery at Vergina, as well as the less recently discovered treasures from the Derveni cemetery, are a vivid witness to the amazing archaeological richness of N Greece, and have made this Museum an essential experience and a serious rival to the great collections in Athens and Herakleion. In addition to these N Greek excavations, the Archaeological Society of Athens supported 29 research excavations all over Greece during 1982, briefly described in Ergon 1982 (to which reference will be found in what follows), and a similar number in 1983, account of which will be taken in AR 1984-85, when Ergon 1983 has become available. While, of course, there is nothing but satisfaction that field archaeology in Greece is so generously endowed, and sup- ported in such high places, and that the new programmes will</page><page sequence="2">4 H. W. CATLING undoubtedly make many important discoveries, substantially enriching sites and museums as it develops, it is inevitable that thoughts should also concentrate upon the conservation, study and publication responsibilities that it will bring with it. The activities of the Foreign Schools continued in 1983 at a number of the sites with which their work, past and more recent, has associated them. The American School continued at Corinth, Nemea and Kommos, the British at Lefkandi (in collaboration with the Archaeological Service), the French School at Argos, Thasos and Mallia, the German School at the Kerameikos, Samos and Tiryns, the Italian School at Gortyn, Ayia Triadha and Lemnos. Rescue excavation, the bread-and-butter fieldwork of the Ephorias of Antiquities throughout Greece, continued to absorb much of the energies of the Archaeological Service. Important sites were investigated in Athens (National Garden; Plaka), Patras and elsewhere. It is more difficult than usual to point to individual finds of exceptional importance, though the resumed excavations in the Idaean Cave in Crete under the direction of Y. Sakellarakis have already yielded finds of very great interest for the student of Greece's relations with the Orient in the Dark Ages and thereafter. It is also becoming increasingly clear how impor- tant the German excavations in the Unterburg at Tiryns (under K. Kilian) have been. While Greece is still the scene of a great deal of very con- ventional archaeological activity, where excavation takes pride of place, there has been no lack of innovative work in recent times. Surface survey, until recently the rather dilettante (how- ever successful) activity of devoted individuals, now demands a more systematic approach to this means of enlarging know- ledge, to be attempted by groups of field walkers under close direction, supported by the specialist studies of geomorpholo- gists, palynologists and social anthropologists. The past few years have seen such surveys in the S Argolis, Arkadia, Lakonia, in the Cyclades (on Kea and Melos). Two works, relatively recently published - W. A. MacDonald and G. Rapp (Eds), The Minnesota Messenia Expedition: Reconstructing a Bronze Age regional environmelnt (Minneapolis, 1972) and C. Renfrew and M. Wagstaff(Ed;) (with major contribution byJ. Cherry), An Island Polity (Cambridge, I982) - illustrate the objectives, techniques and results that may be expected of such enter- prises. Smaller, but equally valuable problem-orientaed surveys are also on the increase, of which the work of P. Moschos and L. Moschou in Mani, of the Dutch School of Surveys in Aetolia are excellent instances. It must, of course, not be overlooked that most valuable site-location work con- tinues to be carried out on an individual basis. The achieve- ments of D. Grammenos in Thrace and of A. Sampson in Euboea should not pass unnoticed. The application of scientific techniques to archaeological prospection has been surprisingly slow to gain general accept- ance in Greece, and even now is only in its infancy. This may partly be explained by earlier disappointing experiences where a technique was employed inappropriate to the special con- ditions of the chosen site. Such dramatic results as those ob- tained in summer 1983 at ancient Stymphalos in nearly ideal conditions by S. Papamarinopoulos and R. E. Jones with computing assistance from Bradford University may, contrari- wise, raise hopes unjustifiably high that such precision can be achieved almost anywhere. Equally, Archaeometry, the application of scientific tech- niques to the solution of a wide variety of archaeological problems, particularly those of date and provenance, has been a late developer in Greece. Interest has, however, been greatly stimulated by the activities of a number of scientists attached to Demokritos Laboratory and to other Greek scientific institutions (of which the regular programme of seminars in Archaeometry conducted at Demokritos is a most healthy symptom). Ceramic provenance work has been considerably advanced by the Fitch Laboratory of the British School at Athens, which has facilities for both chemical and petrological analysis. The quickening interest has naturally increased the number of applications to the Archaeological Service for sampling permits; it is important that work should be co- ordinated at an international level to avoid unnecessary reduplication of effort. 1983-84 had its share of Congresses and Symposia, of which the International Congress of Classical Archaeology held in Athens in September 1983 was probably the most prestigious. The show piece undoubtedly was the closing plenary meeting at which Professor M. Andronikos described the course of his work at Vergina since his first discovery there of the Mace- donian royal cemetery. Vergina also figured prominently in the Fourth International Symposium on Ancient Macedonia, also held in September, 1983, in Thessaloniki, whose partici- pants had the opportunity of visiting some of the N Greek sites, discoveries from which have figured so prominently in recent years. Earlier that month the President of the Republic, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, opened the Second International Colloquium on the restoration of the Parthenon in which progress reports and studies for future work were presented and discussed. During Spring 1983 the French School organised a Table Ronde on the theme of Minoan Iconography. The Association of Greek Archaeologists, at a meeting in Delphi in April 1984, debated the place of Archaeology in Education. Simultaneously, a Symposium was convened in Chios with the theme 'Chios in the AncientWorld'. Archaeological matters continued to arouse controversy. At the international level, the return of cultural property has been the subject of prolonged debate.Within Greece, anxiety was expressed at the likely consequences for the country's ancient sites were effect to be given to a Presidential Decree (unsigned at the time of writing) whereby some, at least, of the control of development at present exercised by the Ministry of Culture through the Archaeological Service should be transferred to the Ministry of Environment. There has been much Greek Press comment on a continuing debate between the Union of Antiquities Guards and their employers over certain terms of service which has led from time to time to sites and museums remaining closed on days and at times when the public would normally expect them to be open. Good and sustained progress has been made with the conservation of the Akropolis of Athens and its monuments; work on the Erechtheion draws nearer its final goal, and pre- parations for the Parthenon are far advanced. In more general terms, conservation of the countless standing monuments of Greece continues a major preoccupation. There are many monuments representing every stage of Greece's long archi- tectural development urgently in need of first aid, let alone the lasting conservation work which alone can guarantee their survival. Much continues to be done both to repair and to protect buildings threatened by development. Interests from time to time inevitably conflict, as has been seen vividly in Spring 1984 in the wide press coverage given to the decision to widen part of the modern Sacred Way where it coincides with the course of the ancient Hiera Odos. This is a good illus- tration of the immense difficulties that challenge the planning authorities in Greece's urban centres where, as so often, they lie immediately over the remains of their illustrious predeces-</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 5 sors. One of the most difficult tasks is to reconcile the living to decisions that adversely affect them, decisions taken out of respect for the remains of the past.

RECENT PUBLICATIONS Reference has already been made to the printing of Archae- ologikon Deltion (ADelt) 30 Chronika (Chr) B' and B2, for I975. New printing techniques have apparently been employed, the results of which are not invariably successful. Reproduction of some black-and-white photographs falls below the usual high standard of this publication. No volume of the Meletai (Mel) of ADelt was published; the last to appear was Mel of volume 32, for I977, published in 1982. By contrast, the Archaeological Society has maintained its excellent record for the prompt publication of the periodicals in which interim reports of excavations in progress are made. Thus, Ergon 1982 (with brief descriptions of excavations carried out in 1982) was published in 1983. The Society's Praktika 1981 A and B were published during this period; these provide more extended interim reports of work already briefly described in Ergon I98I (of which use was made in compiling AR 1982-83). The Society also published Archaeologike Ephemeris (AE) 198I in 1983 and 1982 in I984. The latter became available too late for its contents to be incorporated in this account; use will be made of it in the next AR. The Archaeological Society also published Vol. 99 in its series of monographs, K. Syriopoulos, I metavatiki chroni apo tis mykenaikis is tin archaikin periodon, 1200-700 B.C. The Universities, Learned Societies and Institutions pub- lished periodical literature of interest to readers of AR, account of which has been taken in writing this review. These include the Epistinloniki Epeteris 21 for 1982, of the Faculty of Philo- sophy in the University of Thessaloniki, and Dodoni Io, for 1981, by the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Ioannina. The Polytechnic of Thessaloniki published its Epistimoniki Epeteris 9 for I981-82. A newcomer in University publications is Ariadni I (I983), issued by the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Crete. The Epeteris of the Society for Byzantine Studies, vol. 45 (1981-82) appeared. Anthro- pologika (a periodical with particular interest in New Archae- ology) issued its fourth part in 1983, while vol. 2.2 of Archaeognosia (largely concerned with classical studies) was published. Publications to appear of more local interest include Lakonikai Spoudai 6 (1982); Epeteris 5 for the Society for Studies on Lefkas, for 1978-80; Epeirus 5, pt. 2 (1982); the Archeion vol. 24 of the Society for Euboean Studies, for I981-82; Thrakika, second series, 3 (1980-81); and Kerkyraika Chronika 25 (1981). Two Cretan periodicals appeared - Amaltheia 52-57 (1982 and 1983), by the Society for the History and Folk History of the Nome of Lasithi, and Kretologia 14-I5 (1982). A new local periodical to appear, which receives our warm wishes for a successful future, is Meliaka I (1983), published by the Adelphotis Melion. Less immediately concerned with Greece is a new periodical, Macedonian Studies (printed in India), with an international editorial board, the first volume of which appeared in 1983. This claims to be a quarterly journal, devoted to Macedonian History, Byzantine Studies and the cultural and historic tradition of the Slavs in S Europe. Previously established journals of this category to be published in the period under review include Archeion Pontou 36 (1980) and 37 (1982), with a Parartema I4. Thesaurismata I9 (1982) was issued by the Hellenic Institute for Byzantine and post-Byzantine Studies in Venice. Balkaniki Bibliographia VII (1978) was published in I982. The semi-popular Archaeologia has continued a vigorous career, publishing parts 6-io in the period under consideration. Each part continues largely to be devoted to a particular theme - part 6: Athens; part 7: Thessaloniki; part 8: underwater archaeology; part 9: ancient technology; part Io: ancient attitudes to the Erotic. It is unusual for Archaeologia to publish new material; its Chronika section draws on contemporary press releases. As explained in earlier years, newspaper reports are an important source of information for the preparation of this account, for in many cases they reproduce almost word-for- word the texts of communiques issued by the Ministry of Culture based upon reports issued by individual Ephorias. The column of A. Kaloyeropoulou which appears regularly in Kathemnerini also reports on the main lecture meetings of the season, and gives very useful accounts of the deliberations of congresses and symposia. A file of the press cuttings used in preparing this account may be consulted in the British School at Athens. As well as the periodical literature reviewed above, several monographs of interest to AR readers were published in I983-84. These include some doctoral dissertations, the texts of which have to be printed, albeit in limited editions. As well as works of local or regional interest (which are mentioned as appropriate in the body of this account) more general subjects include G. E. Mylonas, Mykenaiki Thriskeia: Naoi, Vomi kai Tenieni (Transactions of the Academy of Athens 39, 1977); E. Papoutsaki-Serbeti, O Zographos tis Providence (1983); K.

Among writings of general interest in periodical literature may be mentioned the summary by P. Kuniholm and C. Striker in AAA 14 (1981) 230-4 of the results of a programme ofdendro- chronological research in Greece whose first objective is an absolute master chronology from the present to the early I2th cent.

I am very grateful to Directors of excavations and surveys undertaken by the British School in 1983 for allowing me to make use of their reports and reproduce their illustrations, and to the Directors of the other Foreign Schools in Greece (and, through them, to their project directors) who have with customary generosity made reports and photographs available to me. The Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Society have continued to allow me to publish photographs for which they are severally responsible; I am grateful to them, and to the individual scholars who took them. Helen Clark again helped obtain photographs, while Elizabeth Catling has controlled the text in many ways. To them and to Sheila Raven, I am much indebted and most grateful. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. In ADelt 30 Chr 1-3, N. Yalouris describes activities in the National Museum during 1975, when new photographic studios were established and the negative archive reorganized. Among developments in the Sculpture Collection was the redisplay of the metope of the Fig. 2 temple of Athena at Mycenae as well as several free-standing sculptures, including the kouroi 3852, 3858 and 3859 and the kore 73. In the storerooms work continued on the conserva- tion and repair of material from the Antikythera wreck. A. Datsouli-Stavrides has published an account of 27 portrait heads of the late 2nd-5th cents A.D. from the reserves, commenting on the change of spirit in portrait style during this long period (Figs 1-3). (AE I981, 127-38) Elsewhere, she Fig. 3 Fig. I</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 7 has published five R grave stelai (Th 56, Th 144, Th 259, 5435-6) (Archaeognosia 2.2 [I981] 277-82). In the Bronze Collection reorganization of the reserves permitted the re- examination of important groups of material from early excavations, including the Sanctuary of Apollo Ptoos, the Anthedon Hoard and material from the Idaean Cave formerly in the Mitsotakis Collection. Attention is called to a fine bronze mirror (I8113), the handle a winged female at the run, work of an EC Attic atelier, found in a tomb at Trachones, Attica in I949. Work in the Vase Collection included reorgani- sation of material excavated by Keramopoullos in W Mace- donia, described in AE 1932 and PAE I934-38. In AAA I4 (1982) 294-314, S. Karouzou has published a number of Attic bf and rf fragments discovered in I940 buried under the Akropolis Museum and transferred to the National Museum. They belong to known vases or are attributable to known artists. D. Peppa-Delmouzou in ADelt 30 Chr 7-9 has reported on work in the Epigraphic Museum in 1975, with special reference to newjoins. For instance, the hermaic stele EM 9596 (= IG II2 3742) has been completed by the addition of EM 4016. M. Oikonomidou in ADelt 30 Chr 4-6 has reported on the work of the Numismatic Museum in 1975. In Symmreikta V (I983) 49-90, A. Avremea has discussed 36 hoards and indi- vidual coin finds of the 6th and 7th cents A.D. from the Peloponnese. In AAA I5 (1982) 70-6, Ch. Bakirtzis has pub- lished three small Med pots found containing coin hoards, one at Eleusis (I2th cent.) two at different points near Elasson (I3th cent.), drawing attention to the value of such hoards for dating this type of material. Parthenon. 0. Palagia published her 0 Glyptos Thiakosmos toll Parthenona in 1983. Hephaesteion. M. Brouskari has reported on repairs to the temple in 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 12-3). Asklepieion. L. Beschi has published a new study of the fragments of the two versions of the two-sided Telemachos relief (fragments in Athens, London and Padua - see Annuario 45-6 [I967-68] 381 ff.) to which may now be added a fragment from the Museo Maffeiano, Verona. The new fragments preserve part of the figure of Telemachos himself on one side and, on the other, a combination of motifs evoking the Asklepieion in Piraeus from which the cult was brought to Athens (AAA 15 [I982] 31-43). Monument of Lysikrates. Urgently needed repairs were carried out during 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 13). Roman Agora. Essential repairs to the structure were carried out in 1975 by M. Brouskari. In many cases such repairs made good damage caused by the oxydization of iron elements used in earlier repairs (ADelt 30 Chr I3). Athens City. The last full account of rescue excavation was given in AR 1979-80, based on ADelt 29 Chr B1, 31 fE., describing discoveries made during part of 1972, 1973-74. Similar discoveries are now reported by 0. Alexandri for 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 15-35, where some account is given of 31 rescue operations. The practice established in previous years of publishing a street plan of the modern city on which the line of the ancient walls was also marked to plot the locations of the rescues is not observed this time. The method of refer- ence to each excavation is invariably by modern street names, which are repeated here; a convenient modern gazetteer is K. P. Daravingas, Diagramma: Odigos Athinon, Peiraios, Proastion (4th Edition, Athens). Some more recent finds are also covered. The account that follows is brief, discussing the discoveries under a number of rough headings on the model of AR 1979-8o, 6-12. Again, it must be noted that some categories of find cross from one to another. This is particularly true of roads and burials. All references are to ADeht 30 Chr; only page numbers, therefore, are quoted. The most important pre-A discovery was reported in the Greek Press of 1984, describing a group of SMyc and PG tombs found at the junction of Vasilissis Sophias and Herodes Atticus, at the site for the new barracks for the Presidential Guard. There is mention of 73 PG graves (nI burials and 62 cremations in amphoras; other vases were found with the amphoras). This area was previously unknown as an EDA cemetery (sec, for instance, Desborough, Greek Dark Ages, plan, p. 136) (Nea 12.3.84). The City Defences were reported at three points - on Stadiou, where the taphros and part of its revetment came to light, between the NE and the Diochares Gates (for earlier finds here, AR 1968-69, 4, ad fi.) (29). Nearby, on Paparrigopoulou, part of the proteichisma was found. In the fill of the taphros here was a R child burial in a tile grave (27). On Aiolou and Sophokleous, in the vicinity of the Acharnaian Gate (for the city gates, PDAA I68-9), traces of the proteichisnla were noted, as well as the taphros, 9.70 m. wide. Some of the masonry of its outer revetment was preserved (17). Several investigations uncovered parts of what seem to have been domestic builditngs. On Ermou, investigation of the Synetou plot led to the discovery of scrappy R architectural remains, seven wells (six of which had been used as rubbish dumps) and a water tank. When the latter was disused a well was sunk with- in it, lined with terracotta units. Well I produced an incomplete rf lekythos (Athena), mid-5th cent., and the neck of a rf oinochoe (satyr-head). Well 4 (contents chiefly C) included a rf chous (satyr, woman, inscription) of the mid-sth cent. In Well 5 were G-C fragments, and pyramidal loomweights. Of note is a bf olpe with confronted men (one elderly, one youthful) and a slave with diphros on his shoulder, carrying what seems to be an aryballos. Also found are the fragment of a rf crater with a woman, tool in hand, standing before some shapeless object; fragment of a bf horse-head amphora; panathenaic fragment (Athena). Well 6 contained A and C material, including the conical base of an A crater with figures of a bearded Hermes, three women to the left of him, two men to the right. Above and below are friezes of birds. Also found is a rf kalyx-crater: (A) Symposium - two youths on a kline, each with kylix, tables in front, a woman serving food in a lekanis, a youth in attendance; (B) Three youths. A second rf kalyx-crater shows a woman between two men. Well 7 had G--C material, including the fragment of an open rf vase with two winged erotes and two women. Other finds from the plot include architectural items (Doric capital, Ionic base, inscribed kioniskos). Pottery from the fills outside the wells included a transitional Cor oinochoe with animal frieze, rays on the foot, tongues on the shoulder; a 7th-cent. oinochoe with water-birds on the shoulder; fragment of a rf crater - sacrifice at an altar (2I). On Odos Achaeon parts of four rooms of a C and LC house were found. The upper part of a seated female terracotta statuette of the first half of the</page><page sequence="6">8 H. W. CATLING 5th cent. B.C. was found, as well as a bg askos and other C and LC pottery (17). More of the LC house found in 1966 on Odos Menandrou (AR 1968-69, 4) came to light when the Zaphiropoulou plot was investigated, revealing the NW (badly preserved) sector of the mosaic floor whose ornament was arranged in a series of concentric circles around a central emblema. A HL house had been built on the LC remains (25-7). A building plot between Robertou Galli and Karyati- don revealed a C-R building complex. The best preserved part was a HL house of several rooms around a courtyard. After its abandonment it had been traversed by a water-main in clay pipes. Adjacent were the remains of a R building intersected by part of a built water-tank (18). Building remains found in the Plateia of the Ayii Theodoroi were of several periods -no dates suggested (27). On Odos Doreion (W of Philopappos) a LC house was found with 4th cent. pottery (I8), while in the area between the Long Walls, on Odos Kyklopon, remains of a HL building with 3rd cent. coins and fragments of stamped bg vases were found (23). On Ermou, in the Kerameikos area, road-widening located an industrial area (no date suggested) of which the most con- spicuous features were a series of water-tanks, wells and water- mains (I9-20). R and LR buildings were found at several points. On Lepeniotou, a LR complex on the Sepheriadi plot included part of a hypocaustal room; this was immediately adjacent to an ancient (N-S) street, 3.0 m. wide, with six surfaces; parallel to it was a substantial built water-channel, with spolia in its construction, including sculpture fragments, some 4th cent. B.C., others R (24). N of the Agora, on Karaiskaki, LR building remains were found with a terracotta water channel (23). A R and LR complex on Adrianou had walls containing much reused material; the site was much confused by intrusive built pithoi (15-7). On Ay. Theklas (N of the Agora) a LR wall was found on stereo. More recently (Vradyni 19.5.83) a R bath building of two phases was found on Thoukydidou (NE of the Akropolis): 4th cent. and 5th-6th cents. Some of the rooms had mosaic floors. The ancient roads inside and outside the city were uncovered at several points. In addition, great public anxiety was ex- pressed during 1983-84 concerning plans for future develop- ment on the Iera Odos. One objective was to turn at least part of the Iera Odos into an archaeological park, with very limited facilities for circulation of wheeled traffic. An alterna- tive proposal was to use the route as a dual carriageway to speed up traffic in and out of Athens to and from the W - see for instance, Evdomada Kyriaki II.I2.83. Work in 1975 on Odos Herakleidon found the road leading to the Piraeus Gate. (Earlier, similar discoveries reported AR 1979-8o, 9-Io). 14 m. of the road was exposed, of which only the S retaining wall was preserved. The seven surfaces covered the period LC-LR. A piped water channel goes with the second road level; it had been replaced with a larger main, perhaps illus- trating an increased need for water. The site produced a com- plex of water-supply and drainage lines, whose vicissitudes must illustrate the changing functions and fortunes of the buildings in the immediate vicinity (21). The road from the Dipylon to the Academy was examined twice; on Plataeon and Megalou Alexandros, a 12 m. wide section was uncovered for a distance of II m. Part of the retaining wall was found, well preserved, HL in date. A drain was associated (28). On Plataeon and Granikou, on the Gavvari plot, the road was 14 m. wide, uncovered for I0 m. (see also AR 1979-80, 9). Nine surfaces were found; a sewer had been inserted between the fifth and eighth. There had been an A road on this line, for which stereo had been the surface. Of the surfaces, two were C and LC, three were HL, the remainder R and LR (27-8). Several water installations were found, including part of the Peisistratid conduit, on Mikras Asias and Papanastasiou, on an E/W line, 1.20 m. high, 0.80 m. wide, vaulted, 6.50 m. below stereo. A ventilating shaft I.0 m. wide was found (27). On Odos Boreou an ancient built drain was found c. 300 m. NE of the NE corner of the Agora. Though not dated, it is de- scribed as containing spolia (17-8). Also undated is a conduit found on Herakelidon (2I), and another associated with pear- shaped water tank on Kerameikou and Marathonos (23). A built conduit on Aristonikos (close N of the Alpha cemetery, S of the [covered] bed of the Ilissos) was found near part of a paved floor; no date is suggested (I7). A LByz stone and tile- built conduit was found on Aiolou (17). Groups of burials were found, for the most part belonging to known cemeteries on the lines of the roads leading out of the city. On Kaloyerou and Peiraeos, beside the ancient road from the Eriai Gate towards Kolonos (earlier finds, AR 1979-8o, Io), five C tombs were found, three of which were tile graves, one a terracotta slab-lined cist containing a bronze ash-urn (lead lid), one a terracotta larnax (child's grave). Traces of a possible peribolos were found; pottery of the 5th cent. B.C. came from the fills (2I-3). On the same ancient road, burials were found in a plot on Kerameikou and Yiatrakou, where two inscribed kioniskoi were found:- EQ2ITTATPA/HPAIOY and MIKIQN/ /AHMHTPIOY KO-/PEIO:. A cylindrical marble kalpe and cover, R, contained a plain pottery ash receptacle with lid in which were bones, a skull and two gold wreaths (Fig. 4); below was a terracotta larnax whose skeleton had a strigil as offering and two wg lekythoi and a rf squat lekythos (crawling child) (Fig. 5), second half 5th cent. B.C. A third grave (poros sarcophagus) had three bf kylikes, a bg lekanis, two plain lekanides, three small bg phialai, a rf pyxis, three squat rf lekythoi (one, woman's head, r. [Fig. 6]; another, swan displayed, 1. [Fig. 7]), a rf chous (child), alabastron fragment and a bronze mirror disk - all, second half 5th cent. B.C. (23). On Platonos, Siatistis and Pythodorou, NE of the road from the Dipylon to the Academy, six tombs and part of a circular peribolos were found. Four tile graves were half- pillaged, and empty. The others were terracotta larnakes with child burials; one had a fusiform unguentarium. In the associated fills were a bronze mirror disk, a rf squat lekythos (girl, dog), a wg lekythos, two palmette lekythoi. A grave stele of the 4th cent. has a relief- seated woman, r., child Fig. 4</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 9 Fig. 7 standing, 1. Above the former AAA; the latter ANA (28-9). Another eight tombs in the same cemetery were found on Platonos in the Stambelou plot. There were two cist tombs, four poros sarcophagi and two cremation pits, dating from LC through HL to R (iron objects, rf and bg vases, glasses, tc lamps) (29). Part of the road to Kolonos, and a tomb, were found on Odos Myllerou (Skoulaki plot), where the road line was SE/NW, over 6.0 m. wide, with seven surfaces. The tomb was built over the road after its disuse. One of its cover slabs was a reused stele:- [1]IAOKPATEIA/-ENYAAOY/ BOIQTIA. On Menandrou, an inscribed kioniskos BPOYKO/ APIAOY/KONOYAHÂ®EN was found near three fusiform unguentaria (27). More recent Athens discoveries have been reported in the Greek Press, referring in particular to the site for the new barracks for the Presidential Guard on Vasilissis Sophias and Herodes Atticus where, in addition to the DA cemetery mentioned above, remains of a street came to light with pillaged C tombs on either side of it, over which was a R building with glass and pottery vases, and a mosaic floor. There had been wall paintings in some of the rooms. Higher still was a building of the 3rd cent. A.D. with an apsidal feature in which four small statues of Rhea-Kybele were found. The buildings seem to have survived until the 6th cent.; some 500 lamps were found in it (Nea I2.3.84). Discoveries continued to be made in Plateia Lysicratous (AR 1982-83, 8). Press reports of 7 and 8.4.83 refer to an inscribed grave-stele fragment with the name of Euphemia, reused in the building of a R osteotheke. The later use of the area as a cemetery was illustrated by a group of four Byz and post-Byz burials (Nea Fig. 8 Fig. 5 Fig. 6</page><page sequence="8">Io H. W. CATLING 6.4.83). Three built osteothekes were found which may have .... Â· belonged to a late cemetery attached to a now vanished church (reused marbles from church furnishings were found in secondary use inside one of the vaulted osteothekes [Apoyevmatini 2I.4.83]). Mesemrvrini 27.5.83 reported the discovery nearby in' Odos Vyronos of a mosaic floor, probably to be identified as part of an ECh basilica. A small pithos found on the floor is of much later date. Kerameikos. The German School's excavation continued in I983 directed by U. Knigge (AR 1982-83, 9 and ref.). Work took place E of the Sacred Gate and the Eridanos, focused on the stream-bed and the building complex S of the Sacred Way (Figs 8, 9). The road surfaces beyond the stream were not examined. Within the HL Eridanos bed (defined by high walls), Sth and early 4th cent. surfaces of the Sacred Way were found, covered by a Late Antique fill. A large ashlar-built surface, wheel-rutted, that was first identified in I98I con- tinues to the W at an angle to the stream wall. Its function is unclear, as is that of three ashlar breccia blocks describing an Fig. I I arc abutting on a series of limestone slabs 0.50 m. thick, perhaps part of the cladding of the stream-bed in its Kononian phase (Fig. Io). An ostrakon of Themistokles was found here, immediately on bedrock; no trace of the Themistoclean Eridanos bed came to light. S of the Sacred Way and parallel with the Eridanos is the sewer which drained the city from the 5th cent. B.C. until the 6th cent. A.D. It had been repaired several times during its long existence. During the Ist cent. B.C. its sides had been revetted with storage amphorae (Fig. Ii); spolia, largely of Fig. 9 Fig. Io Fig. I2</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 II marble (including a R group of Asklepeios and Telesphoros, Fig. 12), had been used for the same purpose in the 5th cent. A.D. Piraeus. In the Museum, P. Zorides has studied Piraeus 1197, the fragment of a colossal portrait statue of Hadrian, which must when complete have been 3.20-3.30 m. high (Fig. 13). It is of the so-called 'Rollockenfrisur' type, and is likely to have been commissioned to commemorate Hadrian's first visit to Athens in 124. Other portraits of the same type are considered, from Thasos, from Epidauros (no. 22) and in the National Museum. Fig. 13 In ADelt 30 Chr 29-35, 0. Alexandri has described a number of rescue excavations undertaken in 1975; the accounts are summary and dating evidence seems in many cases not to have been found. Readers are referred to the plan of the ancient city published by Judeich, Topographie von Athen, Plan III. Building remains were found at several points - part of a C and LC house was found associated with a water channel on Odos Vas. Georgiou II and Deliyirogi (3I); similar remains occurred in a plot on Vas. Konstantinos,. Kantharou and Kalliga (also with a well and water channel) (3I-2). On Salaminomachon and Phlessa part of a LC and HL courtyard house was found, the court (5.80 X 4.60 m.) surrounded by rooms on all sides (33). In Philonos, a building complex of several periods was found, associated with cisterns. Material from the fills includes a fragment of a female torso and part of a marble sundial. Pottery was chiefly R and LR (35). On Odos Philonos six rooms of a LR building were identified; much of the masonry was in secondary use, and there were signs that some walls were founded on remains of an earlier building. Architectural elements include part of a fluted column, a marble threshold block with sockets for door pivots and an Ionic capital. Pottery and coins in the fills dates from HL-Byz, the majority LR (33-5). No date is suggested for building remains and a well on Praxitelous (32-3). Eight different investigations located cisterns or wells; in some cases the water-channels that fed them were also discovered; no date is suggested for any of them (29-33). Eight further excavations located remains of ancient quarries-on Akti Alkimon, Odos Eukleias and Vyronos extensive quarrying was found; stone had been cut in a series of steps 0.40-0.60 m. high; sequences of up to six such steps were found. Abundant traces of the quarrying process were preserved - preparations to cut, or the traces of successfully removed blocks of i.6o X 0.60 or 1.20 X 0.60 m. were abundant. Remains of a rectangu- lar structure were found. No dates are suggested (29-32). On Eukleias, part of an undated poros quarry was found, with many traces of stepwise quarrying and of the channels (o.oI5- 0.03 m. wide) cut for extracting the blocks (3I). In a quarry on Mytilinis a block ready to remove measured 6.0 X 0.80 X 0.70 m. (32). On Messenias, on a spur N of the entrance to Zea, the poros had again been extracted in a series of up to six steps. Blocks 1.39 X 0.8I; 1.36 X 0.65; 1.70 X 0.65 were noted. On Odos P. Ralli and again on Plessa, Volonaki and Santarosa, cisterns and other water installations were found in the immediate vicinity of the quarries (undated) (32 and 33). More recent press reports refer to a Ministry of Culture project for the cleaning and conservation of the city's ancient walls (Nea 30.3.83). Eleftheros Typos 22.3.84 mentions the discovery of a tomb at the junction of Chios and Thera streets. Environs of Athens. Rescue work in 1975 has been described by O. Alexandri in ADelt 30 Chr 35-9. More recent finds have been reported in the Press. At Tavros four graves were found on Odos Omerou; all were marble sarcophagi with a single skeleton and grave goods (one contained 60 fusiform unguentaria). Other finds included terracotta statuettes (one of Eros) and an iron strigil (38-9). In Moschaton a marble funerary lekythos was found on Platonos and Thermopylon-in relief is a seated woman extending her right hand to a second woman standing in front of her, 4th cent. B.C. (37). Two LR tile graves were found at Ano Liosia (35). On Penteli cleaning works at the Cave of Pan obtained material 5th cent. B.C.-Ist cent. A.D., the period of its use (37-8). A poros sarcophagus burial of the second half of the 5th cent. B.C. found in Ilioupolis contained two bg squat lekythoi, a lidded bg lekanis and a plain pyxis (36). In Kapandriti an ER cist tomb contained three burials and two plain vases (36). In Ayia Paraskevi a sarcophagus burial found in 1983 was dated to the 5th-4th cents B.C. by pottery finds (Vradyni 21.7.83). In Peristeri a 4th cent. B.C. tomb was found containing two squat lekythoi (Eleftheros Typos I4.I.84). In Neos Losmos part of a R funerary peribolos was found in I984, together with a number of burials, including a marble sarcophagus (Mesemvrini 24.1.84). A pillaged poros larnax was found on Odos Smyrnis in Aegaleon, from a cemetery on the N side of the Iera Odos (35). Eleusis. Supplementary study continued at the sanctuary in I982 under the direction of G. E. Mylonas and I. Travlos (AS) (AR 1981-82, I ; AR 1982-83, io) to establish the R and LR architectural sequence. While the munificence of Emperors and notables who were initated meant that the ist cent. B.C.-2nd cent. A.D. was the period when the sanctuary assumed its most monumental form, the defences were neglected over that time, and it was left to Valerian (A.D.</page><page sequence="10">I2 H. W. CATLING 253-60) basically to reorganise them in response to the threat of the Goths and Heruli. This meant the area W of the Great Propylaea and the town on that side were abandoned while the main sanctuary and Telesterion were confined to the old limits within the C and HL fortifications. A new fortification 2.90 m. thick was built, and the Great Propylaea were con- verted into a fortified gate. To ensure the drinking water supply Kallichoron was included within the fortification. In addition, a new wall was built on the line of the old Kimonian defence from the Great Propylaea to the first round tower of the Periklean enceinte, a distance of 94 m.; its construction, including a good deal of spolia, resembles that of the wall W of the Propylaea. The rest of the Periklean wall and the whole of the-SE wall of 360 B.C. had been preserved in good state, and it seems that only the S gate was refurbished. No work was necessary on the W circuit, for a new wall, 2.70 m. thick, had recently been constructed to enclose the acropolis. This new wall was trapezoidal, its angles and midpoints strengthened by rectilinear towers. The ends of the diateichisma were also strengthened by towers. The only entrance was at the SE angle of the diateichisma. The main purpose of this strengthen- ing of the acropolis must have been to create a refuge for the surrounding population (Ergon 1982, 37-8). Rescue excavations at Eleusis in 1975 have been described by 0. Alexandri in ADelt 30 Chr 39-43. Work in a building plot on Iera Odos exposed a 64 m. long stretch of the Sacred Way, and a complex of adjacent structures. The road ran E/W and was 5.70 m. wide. Five of its eight surfaces were C and HL, the remainder R. The kerbs were founded on stereo; they showed many signs of repair and were built for the most part of spolia. The later surfaces on one side were retained by a line of orthostats set on the fourth road surface, including in reuse part of a marble stele (naked youth, resting). N of the road was part of a grave enclosure, containing a poros sarcophagus (contents included an incomplete alabastron and an iron strigil). Two more sarcophagi were found outside the enclosure; their contents included rf squat palmette lekythoi. Remains of a later structure had been built against part of the enclosure. A variety of other structures were uncovered on the N side of the road, including part of a curved enclosure wall that partly coincided with the N kerb of the road, a tile grave and a burial in a poros sarcophagus. On the S side of the road was a rectangular area, stone-paved, apparently open-air. It appeared to be entered from the road by a small propylon with marble threshold on the inner side fitted with sockets for door-pivots. Built into the N side of the propylon was a small inscribed column, in second use:- TEMENOC n1AIANICTQN TQN/YTTO TON TI/TAON. It is suggested that it may have been the temenos itself, or that it was somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood. The S kerb of the road contained three fragments of sculpture in secondary use, including a marble lekythos with relief of a man standing before a seated woman. The man's name APITOTE- AHE/TYZINIOZ is preserved above him; the woman's head is largely lost (39-43). On Leophoros Thivon a I6.50 m. stretch of the ancient Eleusis-Thebes road was examined, where seven surfaces and the N kerb were found. Of eight graves found on the N, five (tile graves) had been pillaged. The remainder were rectangular pits lined with masonry, including fragments of sculpture. One had been used in LA and HL; in the former, eleven vases and a bronze mirror were found, of the first half of the 5th cent. B.C. The HL burial was accompanied by gold leaves and two gold earrings. A second grave contained HL objects; one of its cover slabs was a reused stele, inscribed 2ATYPO2/QKIAAAOY/ MYGOAQPA/GEAFENOYX/EAEYl INIOY. A second in- scribed stele came from the same tomb APOMQN XPHETO0 and a third was found in the associated fills (39), MEIAIXO0 MNHEIETPATOY EAEYEINIO (39). Part of a funerary enclosure (?HL) was found on Odos Vas. Liaskou, where a grave lined with Cor tiles contained a burial, bone needle, illegible AE coin and iron fragments (43). Attica. D. Kazianis has published an account of the over- lifesize marble figure of a young man (Fig. 14) found in 1979 in Plateia Platanou in Kiphissia (AR 1979-80, 13 and fig. 22). He dates it c. A.D. I50, and suggests it may have been used as part of the decor of the substantial R establishment, remains of which have been found at this site (AAA 5 [I982] I30-4I). The piece is now Piraeus 4498. Fig. 14 Loutsa. O. Alexandri found a small 'H' shaped foundation, with C-R pottery, opposite the temple of Artemis Tauropolos in 1975. This may be the remains of a propylon (ADelt 30 Chr 37). Porto Raphti. O. Alexandri reports a LA pithos grave at Tarde in 1975, with five vases, one a bflekythos (man, r.; woman, seated). This is thought to be the site of the deme Steiria (ADelt 30 Chr 38).</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 13 Kalyvia Kouvara. P. Themelis reports the chance find in 1975 of the hand from a marble kouros of c. 540-20 B.C. It does not belong to a known kouros (ADelt 30 Chr 48). Laurion: Agrileza. J. E. Jones in 1983 completed his excavation of the 4th cent. B.C. industrial complex; an extended account of the whole project will appear in the next issue of AR. Laurion: Kamariza (Ayios Konstantinos). P. Themelis describes the excavation in 1975 of a small sanctuary complex of the 4th-Ist cents B.C. at Pousipelia, where architectural remains were exposed in levelling works. In a first phase, an open-air temenos had been surrounded by a circular wall 19.20 m. diam. (part of which survived) used in the 4th and perhaps throughout the 3rd cents. In the 2nd cent. a single- roomed structure was built on the temenos circumference, apparently as a repository for offerings (terracotta statuettes, lamps; small vases). In the second half of the century this building was reconstructed, and the round temenos wall replaced by rectilinear retaining walls on N and E sides. During the ist cent. B.C. a naiskos was built (sekos and prostoon, probably distyle in antis). Scraps of a marble, probably female, statue may have been remains of the cult figure (ADelt 30 Chr 48-51). Laurion: Botsari valley. A complex of LC industrial installations of the second half of the 4th cent. were found in 1975 at the Bodosakis works. Washeries, water storage tanks and storage space were identified. An irregularly-shaped storage tank, 6.90 X 5.50 m. had steps on its E side, its floor and walls covered in hydraulic cement; it was associated with two washeries. A storeroom for metalliferous ore was found; other installations included a 14.0 m. deep well, with rectangu- lar marble well-head with round opening (ADelt 30 Chr 36-7). Sounion. A. B. Tataki published a new guide, Sounion: the Temple of Poseidon (Athens, I983). G. Papathanasopoulos published (thesis) his 'Sounion Iron' Symvoli stin exetasi ton kouron tou ierou kai dierevnisi tou provlimatos tis palaioteris ypaithrias latrias sto Sounio (Athens, 1983). Four tombs were excavated in a known cemetery at Ayios Petros in 1975 including four pithos burials (Fig. 15) and four cremation pits. There were vases in each pithos; one had six Cor vessels (ADelt 30 Chr 38). Rhamnous. B. Petrakos published A Concise Guide to Rhamnous, translated by J. Binder (Athens, 1983). B. Petrakos (AS) in 1982 continued his work at the Nemesis sanctuary and its vicinity (AR 1982-83, ii; AR 1981-82, 13-14, with earlier references). In the early 6th cent. B.C. a small temple was built at the sanctuary with which he links a terracotta head of a sphinx (Fig. I6) and a Lakonian tile stamp Fig. I6 (lion). This suggests that the Nemesis cult predates the Persian wars, and that it may have been the patriotism of the local population that sought to link the site with Marathon. Pottery from the contemporary terrace fill includes loutrophoroi fragments, appropriate to a chthonic cult. Overlying stereo EH, LH, G and A pottery was found. Tests inside the smaller, polygonal temple (built in the first decades of the 5th cent.) showed it occupied a virgin site, implying that the 6th cent. temple must underly the larger temple. A spring-house was found 12 m. N of the larger temple, whose reservoir had been dug out before the construction of the sanctuary terrace. Its facade had included two monolithic columns 2.07 m. high. It was used throughout the 5th cent. Fragments of two statuettes of the first half of the 5th cent. and rf vases were found in undisturbed fill overlying the spring. In a test below the paving of the S Sacred Way fragments of an inscribed perirrhanterion were found in the make-up as well as nearly the whole of a relief showing Herakles resting, kantharos in the right hand, cornucopia in the left (Fig. I7).

CATLING Fig. 17 prompting ideas of continuity of Nemesis cult. The Claudius statue base is now seen to be an appropriated 4th cent. base, a parallel to the rededication of the large temple to Livia, and the placement there of her bust. The naiskoi of Pytharchos and of Diogeiton (Fig. I8) have now been reassembled in the shed built to house the remains of the order of the large temple (AR 1981-82, fig. 23) (Ergon I982, 34-6). Skala Oropou. An EByz tomb was found in 1975 in the Stavrolaki plot, lined with masonry and roofed with stone slabs; fragments of a large wheel-ridged pot were found with the skeleton (ADelt 30 Chr 38). South Kithaeron. D. Ziro has reported an unknown church of Ayia Paraskevi (ruined) (Fig. 19) near the 45th kilometre Fig. 18 Fig. I9 on the old Athens-Thebes road, and compares it to the nearby church of Ayios Yeoryios, dated to the I2th cent. He associates the building of these churches and others in the vicinity with the cult of Ayios Meletios, centred on the saint's monastery nearby (AE 1981, Chr 86-90). ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF Aegina: Kolonna. H. Walter has summarised work in 1981-82 (AR 1981-82, 14-15). On the S slopes of the hill, buildings on a series of platforms were examined; these, notable for the excellence of their masonry (inside faces covered with white or red plaster), date to the end of the 6th cent. B.C. (contemporary with the Apollo temple). Part of the defence wall of the later sanctuary (the N part of which was previously known, notable for its many inscriptions in secondary use) was also identified. A well was excavated in one of the houses, producing fragments of many Attic vases (including panathenaics and rf of good quality). Traces were found of the propylon of the earlier sanctuary which, like the later, seems to have been burnt. The LA propylon has yet to be located. Work was done in the PR 'lower town', built outside the circuit of the MH fortification, provided with its own defences, which prove as substantial as those of the town itself. A MH shaft-grave was found with the remains of a warrior equipped with bronze sword (ivory hilt, gold disk), bronze spearhead, two bronze daggers and a third bronze weapon embellished with gold bulls' heads and gold sheathing on the hilt. A gold fillet with pointille ornament was found on the skull, beside which were boar's tusk helmet-plates. In one of the angles of the tomb were pots attributable to Aegina, the Cyclades and Crete (Kamares type) (AAA I4 [1981] 179-84). Aegina: Temenos of Aphaia. M. Robertson and M. Ohly-Dumm have made a preliminary study of a fragmentary marble kouros of the mid-6th cent. B.C., parts of which have been found separatim since I9oI, most recently the head (battered) in 1978 in excavations by tD. Ohly. The kouros (ht I.IO m.) seems to have stood in the open, close to the early temple at the time it burned. The authors connect it with other sculptures which between them seem to represent an Aeginetan School active before the carving of the pediments of the Aphaia temple (AAA 14 [I98I] 157-6I). MEGARA Greek Press reports refer to the discovery in 1983 of a marble statuette of Dionysos in a building plot; the site may have been a temple of Dionysos (Eleftherotypia 28.6.84). Part of the</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 I5 town's defences and the external circuit road were found during 1975 in the Vordou plot (for the defences, see also AR 1979-80, I9). Part of a tower on the wall was discovered, built of squared poros blocks, four courses remaining, 2.10 m. high. The road had five surfaces; its S kerb was found, of R date. One of the surfaces was flanked by a built drain for storm water which ran the water off into a sump, whence it was taken by an underground drain. Nearby, R pot burials, bowls used as cover, were found (ADelt 30 Chr 43-5). A number of building remains were found within the ancient city during I975, including part of a C building on Loukianou and Theokritou (48), a HL building on Athinas (43) and, on Odos Dimitros, parts of a LHL-LR complex, including house remains, water tanks and a well-shaft coated with hydraulic cement, with foot-holds. A second water-tank (circular) was inscribed within a square structure (43). On Meletiou Zacharia a complex of walls was found (no date suggested) and two graves, one of which was a child's sarcophagus burial with two LG vases (one Cor) (46-8). In three building plots on Odos Minoas sections of the ancient road were found leading from Megara to Nisaia, with parts of the cemetery by which it was lined on either side. The road's line is NW/SE, Â± 5.50 m. wide; five surfaces were found in one place, six in another. A built drain runs beside it. On the W side was a funerary enclosure, containing three HL tombs. In front of two of them a column drum had been placed, in front of the third an Ionic column. In the spaces between these features fragments of poros blocks were found as well as HL vases, unguentaria and two lead kalpai, one of which had two glass unguentaria, an ivory comb, fragments of ivory rings and a bronze handle. The tombs were made of stone slabs; contents included glass vessels and leaves of a gold wreath. A further group of tombs included six sarcophagus burials, three cists, and a number of inurned cremations. Grave goods, where dated, are HL and include many fusiform unguentaria (43-6). An HL tomb and part of an associated ?funerary peribolos were found in public works on the Megara-Pagai road in I975 (37). EUBOEA Chalkis. Parts of the ancient city and its cemteteries were revealed in a succession of building plot excavations in 1975, on which A. Sampson reports in ADelt 30 Chr I35-48. On Odos Kyzikou, in an area well known for G occupation, an archi- tectural succession of three phases was found, the lowest G, the middle (associated with a mosaic floor) HL (138). Part of a large HL building was found on Arethousas (I38); other HL buildings were seen on M. Alexandrou, with a round well (I43); HL buildings underlay a R courtyard house found in a second plot in the same street (I35). Spolia (including a fluted marble column) had been used in the construction of a R building at the foot of the Ayios Ioannis hill (I44-5). Another R building was identified nearby (145). Development in several plots in the Ergatikes Katoikies area revealed groups of build- ings arranged on an orthagonal street plan - much interest will attach to the detailed publication of these discoveries, which include the pottery factory found complete with the clay base of the potter's wheel, as well as large quantities of pottery, clay moulds, kiln wedges and lamps. A wide variety of pot shapes, lamps, loom weights, roof tiles, water pipes and statuettes was produced in the factory. Most material dates to the Ist and 2nd cents A.D. (138-40). This is doubtless the site alluded to AR 1982-83, 11-2). Close to the pottery factory, a well-designed building complex was found on the Basoukou plot, where the main architectural scheme was HL but there was much R material in the overlying fill. The building line was at the junction of two ancient streets - across the road, remains of a second HL building were also partly investigated. Part of the building, on the street corner, had been demolished to make way for a deep-built basement, with several niches in its walls. The walls were covered with hydraulic cement to some distance from the floor. Built in ER times, it seems to have been used as a cistern. When abandoned it was used as a rubbish dump, containing masses of material from the pottery factory, together with glass, much animal bone and shell and many bone pins and needles, some with decorated heads and shafts. This site established that there was already a town grid by early HL (I45-8). A HL building nearby, on another street, had been demolished and replaced by an ER house, and the site again built on in LR times; the street (which had a piped water line in its make-up) seems to have been in use throughout this succession (140). Elsewhere, the dominant phase in a building succession was HL, where loom weights and Megarian bowl fragments were found of the 3rd-2nd cent. B.C., chiefly of Attic origin. A fragmentary amphora decorated in relief showed men dancing and other motifs; tragic masks were attached to its lower handle terminals. West Slope ware came from a possible courtyard. Elsewhere there was much R material contem- porary with the pottery factory in disturbed levels. A fragment of R floor had iron slag (some of it from below the floor). Lower still a pure C deposit and wall were found (I4I-3). Another building succession contained G sherds, with a good C level containing good-quality pottery (fragments of a bf pyxis, rf fragments, lamps). The HL level above contained much pottery and many lamps. Over it were the remains of a LR house some of whose rooms had coarse mosaic floors (145). Finally, a water tank was found built over an earlier HL wall adjoining an ancient street resurfaced many times (140). On Odos Lelantion remains of a R house, badly damaged by the recent construction of a potter's kiln, was found on the same orientation as the buildings in the Ergatikes Katoikies complex. On Odos Arethousas, structures, including a substantial terrace wall, probably of 4th cent. B.C. date were found below the water table, in the immediate vicinity of the ancient harbour on the edge of Ayios Stephanos bay (I35). Finds in the cemeteries include, on Odos Arethousas, a group of I9 tombs in the Ayios Stephanos cemetery SE of the city, near the sea on the way to Eretria. Most were tile- graves, dating from the early 3rd-late 2nd B.C. There was much pottery among the grave-goods (some Megarian bowls) and several coins. In the overlying fill was material from disturbed burials, including part of a marble grave stele inscribed EYKPATOY (I37-8). Two tile graves (?HL) on the W slopes of Vathrovouni suggest that the Ayios Stephanos cemetery must be of considerable extent (138). On Odos Monis Erion part of a largely ECh cemetery was excavated; more of it had been dug in I970. Twelve graves 3rd-6th cents were found, containing pottery, lamps, glasses and coins. A well in the vicinity (earlier) contained 4th-3rd cent. B.C. pottery. A stele inscribed on both sides was found elsewhere on the site (I43-4). Nine ECh graves were found on Odos 7th Syntagmatos (five tile graves, four rock-cut); there were no offerings (I44). On Odos Dimitriou, four tile graves, though without finds, may well be Byz; this area, W and S of the Veli Baba hill, has produced Med graves in the past (I43). M. Georgopoulou-Verra has described public works and other building activities in Chalkis in 1975 when several Med remains were noted. A marble well-head was found decorated</page><page sequence="14">i6 H. W. CATLING with the arms of the Dandolo family. It had been partly recut in Ott times (ADelt 30 Chr 17I-2). P. Themelis has studied the inscription IG XII 9 907, first found in the Igth cent. and published BCH 1892, I02-6, rediscovered in I968 near the main market. It is an edict of Publius Ampelius, datable to A.D. 359 when he was proconsul of Achaea (Arch. Euv. Mel. 24 [I981-82] 219-42). Eretria continues to be the focus of much excavation (Greek rescue and research projects, Swiss School) and study. The pressures created by an expanding modern town exactly coinciding with the remains of an important ancient city, its wall-stumps breaking surface at innumerable points, are intense, and place relations between the community and the Archaeological Service under great strain. E. Touloupa published her Ta enaetia glypta totl naou tou Apollonos Daphniphorou stin Eretria (Thesis: Ioannina, 1983). A. Andreiomenou has described building-plot investigation during 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 155-64. The earliest of a succession of building remains on the Roumbi plot were associated with G material. Much 5th cent. B.C. material was found, as well as 4th and 3rd cent. B.C. objects (I56). Part of a monumental building belonging to the Agora was found on the Klathi plot, with earlier remains beneath. Deposits were disturbed; G, C and HL pottery was found, including a fragmentary rf cup; (I) Siren, r. (Fig. 20) (158-9). On the Styliarou plot three Popoli plot (I 59); a complex of water mains and drains found on the Angelopoulou plot were found in a mixed horizon with G, C and HL pottery (I58-60). No date is suggested for the building remains and water lines found on the Theodorou plot. A. Andreiomenou has published a detailed account of the LG and SG skyphoi from her excavations of I973 and I977 (Figs 21-3), with a valuable series of photographs and profile drawings (AE I98I, 84-II3). Fig. 21 Fig. 22 Fig. 20 building phases were identified, in the first of which (associated with C pottery) were what may have been remains of a potter's kiln. Apparently to this level belonged fragments of a bf eye-cup ('Leafless Group'); (I) Gorgoneion (A) and (B) Maenads between handles and eyes. HL pottery and lamps were found with later walls and associated floor. In a nearby courtyard HL pottery was found in the fill of a built well (I59-6I). At least one room had had a pebble mosaic floor in a 4th cent. complex associated with central courtyard on the Philippi plot (161-3). Similar remains (including mosaic) were found on the Vraka plot, with C and HL pottery and lamps and a heavy bronze arrowhead with impressed flower device (I6I). LC and HL building remains were found on the Fig. 23 P. Kalligas has discussed the topography of the Agora of the C and HL city in the light of recent excavations in the modern town, much expanding the account in the Eretria Guide (Auberson and Schefold, I973, 163 if.). The Agora was enclosed by stoas on the N, E and W sides. The main N/S artery through it was on the W, immediately in front of what</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 17 may have been a fourth, W, stoa, which then continued N in the direction of the Apollo temple. E of the Agora another road, on a converging course, led to the Spring House. Streets at right angles to this appeared to have formed insulae within which have been found remains of private houses (AAA I5 [1982] 3-9). B. Petrakos has published a preliminary account of an excavation in I980 of remains of part of one of the stoas, Doric in style, roofed with Cor tiles (Arch. Euv. Mcl. 24 [1981-82] 324-36). A. Andreiomenou reports the discovery in 1975 of an honorific decree of 341-338 B.C., set up by the Assembly of Eretria for a citizen of Sikyon; the text was to be studied by D. Kn6pfler (ADelt 30 Chr 163-4). The activities of the Swiss School were on a reduced scale in I982. In collaboration with the Greek Service a small supplementary excavation was undertaken in the Agora, in the E stoa; a detailed report in a Greek periodical is awaited. P. Themelis (AS) continued in 1982 excavation of the 'defensive enclosure' complex (AR 1982-83, 15 and reference). The bothros found in 1981 was further dug; as well as its fill of clay, sand and rubble it produced many animal bones and much pottery, chiefly of the last quarter of the 8th cent. B.C. In Area I the presence of a NE/SW wall was confirmed, contemporary with the defensive enclosure and associated at this point with the gate. A deep sounding adjacent to the wall exposed a succession of street surfaces, pottery from which covers the LG and SG periods (750-68o B.C.). Further S, in the SW angle of Area H, the early 5th cent. B.C. deposit was completely cleared. The head of a goddess, severe style, was found. In the E sector a wider clearance of the HL buildings was made, including a basement reached by a built staircase. This had been destroyed at the turn of the 4th-3rd cents B.C. Finds included a many-nozzled lamp in the form of a ship. Study in the Eretria Museum of material found earlier located the right leg of the HL group of Aphrodite and Eros found in 1978 (AR 1979-8o, fig. 39) (Ergon 1982, 36-7). P. Themelis has given a fuller account of the goldsmith's hoard found in 1980 (AR 1980-81, 9, figs. 12-3) in AAA 14 (1981) I85-208. He identifies traces of a painted inscription on the skyphos containing the hoard, comparing it with the inscribed Pithekoussai fragment (AR 1970-71, 67, fig. 8). He dates the deposition to 700-680 B.C., associating it with the final phase of the Lelantine War. He describes a gold diadem (found folded many times) 0.337 m. long, decorated (traced) with chariots, warriors and wild animals. Euboea (other than Chalkis and Eretria). A. Sampson has reported a wide variety of chance discoveries during 1975 at many points in the island in ADelt 30 Chr 152-5). Manika. The results of the rescue excavation directed by A. Sampson since 1983 (AR 1982-83, I2) are of great interest. A preliminary account has been given by Sampson in Archaeologia 6 (1983) 67-76. An EH settlement has been found 800 m. from the Manika peninsula, where remains of rooms and storage areas recall earlier finds at Lerna and Akovitika. Surface indications point to a substantial settlement, pre- dominantly EH II, though there is late EH I material in the earliest excavated levels. In a separate area, S of the peninsula, near the shore, remains were found of what must have been a tool-making manufactory for obsidian, apparently EH II. This industrial (?and commercial) site may have extended into an area now covered by the sea. At yet another area a large EH building was identified whose floors were slabbed; one room contained an exceptionally large quantity of obsidian. The cemetery consists of a large number of chamber tombs reached by short dromoi, sealed by slabs of masonry. Most contained a single skeleton; a few held two. The majority of those buried seem to have been young women or children. The complex must be seen as one of the largest known EH sites, perhaps to be seen as an EH version of Chalkis. Later press accounts of the excavation refer to a rich tomb whose contents included stone vases, 'frying-pans' and other objects (Nea 30.7.83). Nea Artaki. E. Saranta-Micha and S.-K. Mishra have described Palaeolithic material found on the surface NW of the village (Archaeologia 8 [1983] 55-8). Psachna. A. Sampson has described limited tests in the N settlement at Varka (AR 1976-77, i8), where traces of house remains were found. Both MN and LN occupation is suggested by the variety of pottery fabrics (ADelt 30 Chr 148-52). At Glifas (BSA 6i [1966] 56, no. 34) tests were also made, finding part of a building and its floor. This small habitation may be rather earlier than Varka (152). Politika. The discovery in 1975 of a group of ECh tile graves near the beach is reported by A. Sampson. There were no grave offerings (ADelt 30 Chr 148). Oreoi. Part of a water conduit was found in 1975 some way from the village, identified as part of an aqueduct for ancient Oreoi (ADelt 30 Chr I48). Lefkandi. Thejoint Greek-British excavation at the Toumba site held a short excavation season in 1983 (AR 1982-83, I2-I5 and references) under P. Kalligas and M. R. Popham, who have reported as follows:- 'The E room was cleared of its fill to reveal a row of post- holes for the central columns. Three corners of the room con- tained structures of uncertain purpose; that in the NW a rectangular "box" constructed of mudbricks, in the SE a slightly raised platform of roughly oval shape with a mud plaster covering, in the SE a circle of stones with a pebble fill. The general fill of the room contained pottery of the same basically MPG character as that found previously elsewhere, though for the first time a few fragments from somewhat unusual pendent-semicircle skyphoi were recognised. 'At the E end, a further "storage" pit was located within the apse and two more of the post-holes of the peristyle. No post-holes were found either here or elsewhere against the outer face of the main walls.' Karystia and Styria. T. Zappas has published a detailed and careful study of the quarry sources of Karystian marble (cipollino), of quarrying techniques and of methods of transport to the coast and loading for sea transport (Arch. Euv. Mel. 24 [1981-82] 243-75). Ch. Pharantos has continued his study of Byz and post-Byz churches in S Euboea at Daphne, Perivolia, Ayios Yeoryios, Ayia Thekla, Orologi and Ochtonia (Arch. Euv. Mel. 24 [I981-82] 277-312). Krieza (E of Aliveri). A. Sampson reports the discovery in 1975 of a schist-built tomb of fine construction with three rf palmette lekythoi of the early 4th cent. B.C.; near was a marble sarcophagus with a child's skeleton and a similar lekythos (ADelt 30 Chr 148). A small cave was found in 1975</page><page sequence="16">18 H. W. CATLING at Mistros, Arakospilia, where, in a level of ash, ten rf squat palmette lekythoi were found, as well as three bg lamps and a terracotta statuette (ADelt 30 Chr I53). Voudochi (N of Eretria). Two concentric lines of forti- fication were found at 800 m. ASL, without any evidence of date (ADelt 30 Chr I53). CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS P. Papahatzis published Ancient Corinth: The Museums of Corinth, Isthnmia and Sikyon (Athens, 1983). K. Krystalli-Botsi has published an account of rescue excavation at Corinth in 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 59. A R workshop complex was found in a building plot, associated with two water-tanks and two wells. Coins, bone pins and an inscription were found. At Lefkos Potamos a R funerary monument was excavated. Niches in the inner wall-surfaces had been used for ash-ums. Nearby was the substructure of a Pi-shaped HL funerary monument, with a brick-built tomb, covered with poros slabs, the sides revetted with parts of fluted pilasters in secondary use. In a cavity in the rock below the foundation of this structure, concealed by a pile of stone, was a bronze hydria of the 5th/4th cent. B.C. around the neck of which was a gilded wreath of flowering myrtle (Fig. 24). In the Christodoulou plot part of an almost wholly pillaged HL cemetery was found, and, nearby, part of a brick-built R house, its wall surfaces covered with marble revetments. C. K. Williams II, on behalf of the American School, continued his excavation at Corinth in 1983. He writes:- 'In 1981 and 1982 excavation had been conducted along the E side of what is now known as the E Theater Street, in the area immediately E of the stage building of the theater and its NE court (Fig. 24a). 'This year excavation was focused between 30 and 55 m. further to the S, around trenches that originally had been dug in 1925 and 1926 on both sides of the E Theater Street (Fig. 24b). One of the areas of the I925 and 1926 excavation, lying on the E side of the street, was named "Athena Trench" because Fig. 24 Fig. 24a oI*N:5H : $ tfr: 0 : IfLLtM iS II: : i 0 lWt : WfLOAMÂ»S , ,1 ,, I I1:;" :.: , ' Â« . - . 4 i ,::: .1 . O :: , :e I..E ~R~</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 I9 Fig. 24b it was thought that the sanctuary of Athena Chalinitis might be found there between the odeion and the theater. This arose from a reading ofPausanias that implies that the sanctuary was in just this position. Excavation undertaken to verify the theory had been interrupted, however, and thus not published in a final form. In this condition the area retained its name "Athena Trench", despite the lack of remains to certify the identification. 'The present report is a stratigraphic and chronological supplement to the original excavation reports. Six distinct phases of activity have been distinguished and are presented here. 'Phase One, Greek. Evidence was found for at least one Greek level in the trenches of the I920s, attested now by a series of walls that rest either close to or on bedrock and a reservoir, I926-2, that was found filled with a large quantity of HL moulded relief bowls. These architectural remains have an orientation different from those of the earliest R structures in the area. No information was retrieved about the Greek levels in the 1983 excavation. 'Phase Two, Roman. Initial construction in the ER period, probably within the first years of the colony, i.e. during the reign of Augustus. This period ends with a destruction within the late Ist cent. A.D. Evidence for the destruction is clearly seen around the vomitoriuni of the theater. 'Phase Three, Roman. Construction in the late Ist cent. A.D., probably after A.D. 77. Destruction brings this phase to an end in the third quarter of the 3rd cent. A.D., or slightly later. This destruction is best attested in a structure on the E side of the E Theater Street, called the Terraced Building, which lies opposite the ramped entrance which connects the street to the court of the odeion. 'Phase Four, Roman. Reconstruction in the 270s, with the raising of the ground level E of the E Theater Street behind a new high terrace wall. The destruction that demanded the reconstruction probably should be equated with strata of destruction excavated E of the theater in I98I and 1982. This phase comes to an end in the second half of the 4th cent. 'Phase Five, Roman. The building of a wall along the W side of the E Theater Street in the second half of the 4th cent. and the dumping of fill behind it, or on its W side; this was topped off, apparently, in the early 5th cent. This street wall cuts off the ramped access from the E Theater Street to the odeion which had been in use since the late ist cent. A.D. 'Phase Six, Byzantine. Reoccupation in the LByz period. 'The Terraced Building. The earliest stratified material found this year comes from a deep fill piled against the S side of a buttressed terrace wall that stretches E/W into the E scarp of the Athena Trench itself. The fill behind this earlier terrace wall contained a large number of non-joining sherds of late C date, with a concentration of pots of very late 4th cent., some West Slope wares and HL moulded relief bowls. All but the bottom-most strata contained one or two pieces of R pottery. This wall, with the fill it retained, mav have been erected at the beginning of the colony and thus the pottery represents clean-up during the ER restoration of the city. This terrace forms the W limit of the Terraced Building. 'The Terraced Building, which is between the early terrace and the ER theater, appears to have been built contempo- raneously with them. On the E side of the E Theater Street opposite the ramped entrance to the odeion is the W wall of the Terraced Building, its lower fabric of coursed poros ashlar and its upper wall in opus reticulatum. At the N end of this wall is a patch of coarser stonework, a repair made when the area was reterraced in the 270s. The interior of the Terraced Building was less impressively built than the exterior walls might suggest, with the rooms decorated by frescoes painted on a mud backing, which, in turn, was put onto a mud wall. The building was entered along its N exterior wall from the walkway leading in from the street. 'It is along this entrance where a series of alterations to the building can be best seen. A fill of mudbrick and plaster debris was laid down over the original hard, level floor of the walk- way. Steps were laid directly on this debris allowing a rise of a meter from street level; they show a goodly amount of wear. These steps were put out of use when they were covered by a new, hard surface, done apparently because the levcl of the E Theater Street had been raised to a point which made the steps useless. 'The frescoed decoration of the rooms of the Terraced Building, especially the NW corner room, and the finds within the building suggest domestic or domestic and indus- trial functions, not religious. Here, too, in destruction debris and clean-up of the end of the 2nd cent. or first years of the 3rd cent. were found numerous fragments, some quite large, of glass basins discarded from some close-by glass factory. 'The stratigraphic evidence suggests that this building, along with apparently much else in the neighbourhood, was des- troyed in an earthquake. Mudbrick walls were found collapsed in large pieces over the floors; the decorated wall plaster which had covered these walls was found in that fill also in large pieces among the mudbrick debris. Similar debris was found covering the road-metal of the E Theater Street.' Isthmia. P. Clement has reported excellent progress in the preparation of the final reports on the excavations of the University of California, Los Angeles, from I967. The study of the Roman Arch which became the core of the NE Gate of the Hexamilion Fortress has been completed by T. E. Gregory, illustrated by the drawings of W. B. Dinsmoor Jr (Fig. 25). T. E. Gregory has also continued his study of the Hexamilion, the transisthmus fortification wall of Late Antiquity and a very important part of the excavations. L. Wohl has written the first draft of her monograph on the Greek and Roman lamps. J. Marty has made progress with her monograph on the R pottery and S. Lattimore has ready most of the final text of his catalogue of the sculpture. M. Mills finished weighing all the coins. He also compiled a study-list of all stamped tiles, which he will publish. G. Schmidt will publish the terracotta figurines. M. MacVeagh</page><page sequence="18">20 H. W. CATLING W B DINSMOOR,JR -1981/83 Fig. 25 Thorne has advanced her study of the West Cemetery and its pottery. C. Peirce revised and completed his plan of the course of the Hexamilion; the plan is based on the Papanis Survey of 1970-71, and shows the line of the wall from Corinthian to Saronic Gulf. He made studies for restorations of the NE Gate and for the juncture of Fortress Wall and Hexamilion at Tower 2. It has been decided to combine in one publication all the Greek and Latin inscriptions ever found in the Poseidon Sanctuary. The texts from the Isthmia Excavations itself will be edited by D. Jordan. P. Clement has completed the catalogue of coins found in the nine excavation campaigns. An introduction will correct and refine preliminary interpretations made in Essays in Honor of Basil Laourdas (Thessaloniki, 1975), in Hesperia 45 (1976) and in Ancient Macedonia: Second International Symposium (Thessaloniki, 1977). Stymphalos. E. H. Williams in 1983 continued on behalf of the Canadian Archaeological Institute at Athens to collab- orate with the Archaeological Society and J. Travlos in various survey activities. The Fitch Laboratory of the British School also participated. He writes (in a longer report): 'Geophysical survey: About 25,000 m.2 were surveyed by electrical resistivity meter and I2,000 m.2 by proton magneto- meter. Results were processed immediately in the field on an Epson HX2o battery powered computer that printed out a dot density plot of areas of high and low resistance/magnetic intensity at a scale of I: 500. Many linear features were detected including two clear peristyle structures, lines of streets and city walls, etc. Work concentrated in the SE part of the city closest to the lake. Tests of 800 m.2 were also made in the NE area of the city, on its W wall, due S of the theatral area carved out of its acropolis and on 4000 m.2 in the NW part of the city. Best results came from the first area, but the last area also produced a number of linear features that indicate lines of streets and buildings. All these areas have been much worked over by tractor-drawn ploughs and the ancient remains have clearly been much disturbed, and even eradicated from the sub- surface to as much as a metre. Generally speaking results from the resistivity survey were much superior to the magnetic. 'Architectural survey. The plan of the S city wall along the edge of the acropolis was completed. Several new gates and towers on both E and W city walls were discovered. Three especially large fortification towers, including an unusual polygonal one, were drawn up in detail. As two of them seem designed for artillery and are bonded into the city wall it seems necessary to reconsider the date in the second quarter of the 4th cent. B.C. assigned last year to the circuit. The regular rectangular towers in the W city wall are almost identical in size to those at Halos in Thessaly, perhaps founded (like Sikyon) on an orthagonal plan by Demetrius. The unusually dry conditions produced a good set of crop marks in the SE area of the site where the proximity of the lake and regular flooding makes cultivation and consequent destruction of ancient walls difficult. Elements of seven city blocks were planned. 'Area survey. The site was examined for architectural material ploughed up in recent agricultural work and thirty fragments of Doric and Ionic capitals, column drums, bases, mouldings, etc. were recorded. Four funerary stelai with traces of inscriptions were found in a field just N of the site, indicating the presence of an ancient cemetery, while a tile grave was found against one of the towers on the W wall.

M</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 2I city another field proved to be the source of three more inscribed stelai, and a third possible necropolis was reported elsewhere in the valley. An inscribed herm was found at the N foot of the acropolis in the city. 300 m. W of the city a large precinct wall was found with cuttings in bedrock for stelai. 'The entire length of the R aqueduct discovered in 1982 was traced for nearly 3 km. across the plain from the village spring (where its underground course was in part detected with resistivity survey, a channel 1.14 m. wide) by crop-marks, until it disappeared into a Igth cent. irrigation tunnel cut through the hills at the E end of the plain; broken R brickwork lay near the mouth of the tunnel. This is probably the aqueduct Pausanias mentions as built by Hadrian to Corinth. 'Cistercian Abbey. Examination of the remains of the 13th cent. Gothic church revealed a narthex that does not appear on Orlandos' plan or reconstruction. The original plan of the church seems to have required a transept not included in the final building.' Sikyon. K. Krystalli-Botsi (AS) returned in 1982 to the site originally excavated by A. Orlandos and cleared the later (R) wall at the SE corner of the large stoa, where she found foundations of a number of small rooms and HL architectural fragments. This work may well have confirmed Orlandos' conjecture that this is the HL stoa of Lamia (Ergon 1982, 38-9). Titani (28 km. W of Corinth). A R bath building, heavily damaged by earthquake, was found and partly excavated in I975. Below it a MH level was found (ADelt 30 Chr 59). Nemea. S. G. Miller continued his excavation for the American School in 1983 in three general areas (AR 1982-83, 24 and references). One was in the SW corner of the Sanctuary in and beside the Heroon; another was on the S side of the Sanctuary in probes beneath the 4th cent. Bath House and near the EChr Basilica, and the last was to the SE of the Temple of Zeus. He writes:- 'Probes beneath the HL Heroon were undertaken with a view to clarifying the structure's early history. In one test trench located at the SE corner of the Heroon there came to light a stretch of wall of the A phase of the shrine. A second test trench was laid out to investigate a cluster of boulders set upright near its centre in a scheme suggesting a small chamber. Excavation revealed that these stones were in their present position by the A period, thus reconfirming the vulnerability of the structure. It is likely that the chamber formed a focus for cult in the Heroon from early times. 'Excavation just W of the Heroon revealed the presence of an A road running N/S which was bordered by a handsome retaining wall on its W side. This road went out of use in the HL period and was replaced by structures which have left only fugitive remains. 'Traces of another A road, also running N/S, were recovered beneath the Bath House. This road, which intersected with an A E/W road discovered in 1982, was replaced already in the 5th cent. B.C. by a series of buildings culminating in construc- tion of the Bath House in the 4th cent. Besides the fragmentary remains of several buildings of the C period, the most signi- ficant find was a votive pit of the first half of the 5th cent. which was filled with vessels (drinking cups, votives, etc.) and bones and ash. 'A brief probe off the NW corner of the EChr basilica revealed installations of the 5th to 6th cents A.D., apparently storage facilities and perhaps a cistern. Cleaning nearby on the banks of the Nemea River produced several interesting archi- tectural terracottas belonging to the A Temple of Zeus, most notably a nearly complete ridge akroterion. 'SE of the Temple of Zeus remains of several buildings were uncovered. First there was found the very fragmentary corner of an EChr structure preserved among the usual shallow farm- ing trenches. Other activity of this era was represented by a series of long, deep trenches which might possibly have had to do with irrigation. The trenches were filled in during the EChr period and included a wealth of earlier material such as pottery, lamps, coins, architectural members, and architectural terracottas. 'Directly E of the easternmost Oikos foundations were discovered of a structure which appears to be an annex to that Oikos. Constructed, according to ceramic evidence, in the HL period, it had reused in its foundations significant earlier architectural pieces including several belonging to the facade of the Oikos next to which it was built; notable among these pieces was the central akroterion. 'Between these last two structures lay a rectangular building of the first half of the 5th cent. B.C. Measuring c. 11.50 X 9.70 m., its E part is subdivided into two rooms of unequal size. Its function was not determined but it might have had to do with accommodating priests or officials at the Games. 'A boundary stone reading QPPOE EnITTOAAE in letters of the 4th cent. B.C. was discovered near the rectangular building. Although other interpretations are possible, it is perhaps likeliest that this is a boundary stone to the sacred square where, according to Pausanias, cypress trees were planted and where visitors to the Games will have con- gregated.' Argos. ADelt 30 Chr carries no reports of rescue excavation in the ancient city during I975. In 1983, the French School continued work in Argos at several points. G. Touchais has reported on activity in the Aspis (AR 1977-78, 26; AR 1979-80, 28), when he checked the plan and stratigraphy in the N sector of the MH buildings partly excavated in 1976 and 1979; excavation in this area is now complete. Baulks were removed and some soundings enlarged. The two architectural phases previously recognized were confirmed, the older represented by a curved wall, the latter by a rectangular building (unfortunately not complete) (Fig. 26) whose size and plan allow comparison with the long building in the SE sector and Vollgraff's House N. Like the SE sector, all these buildings belong to the second half of MH, Fig. 26</page><page sequence="20">22 H. . CATLING though further work will be needed to determine whether there is close identity in the chronology of the two sectors. More work on the N fortification shows its width to be 3.0 m. It cannot be the rampart for the earlier MH settlement; the lowest course of the outer face is composed of a MH wall 0.80 m. wide, 6.50 m. of its course preserved. This rests directly on the earliest MH level which exists either side of the wall. This cannot be the same as Vollgraff's first fortifica- tion (1.60 m. wide). It might be the enceinte of the second MH settlement, but neither its thickness nor the length preserved can prove this. Only with the second course is it really possible to speak of a fortification. The 'cyclopean' character of the two courses may suggest they are contemporary, and therefore MH, but the stratigraphy associates the upper courses with the surface level which contains HL material, and some A. If the wall is earlier than the bastion (Fig. 27) (which is almost certain), and were not to be MH (which is possible), it can only be A. This is not contradicted by the polygonal masonry, without bossing, of the NE rampart. building below the C level in the N stoa. Soundings in search of the R race track were negative. P. Aupert completed his excavation of Bath B, and deter- mined the identity of individual rooms. Following the E entrance is the apodyterium A, followed, oddly, by two frigidaria (FI and F2), the latter opening partly onto an inter- mediary room (B), which in its turn leads to the palaestra and, to the S, to the succession of heated rooms. There are two tepidaria (TI and T2), followed by the caldarium C. The palaestra was surrounded by brick arcades. Tests were made below floors, especially where there were damaged mosaic floors in Room B, exposing a complex of earlier walls whose elucidation is difficult. The mosaic floor had been repaired at the end of the 3rd cent. A.D., at the earliest. The remains of the Byz building in TI were completely excavated as well as the remains of a floor. Objects recovered included the tile- stamp 'Menon Architect'. In Bath A, P. Aupert's architectural study suggests that in its first phase the building had been a Serapieion. A wall with doorway may be restored E of Room A as the predecessor of the colonnade of Phase II (bathing establishment proper), which solves the problem of roofing B 1-2-3. The existence of a plunge-pool in Room G of Phase II was confirmed. J. des Courtils examined the substructure of the Hypostyle Room with inconclusive results for its chronology and identify- ing its predecessor. A section of aqueduct was identified by the French School SE of Gymno, perhaps the source for the nymphaeum on the Larissa, several other fragments of which have been pre- viously found in the countryside N of Argos. Dendra. A resumed Greek-Swedish collaborative excava- tion took place in 1983 under the direction of K. Demako- poulou and P. Astrom when tests were dug at the citadel to date the defences and search for an underground passage. The fortification dates from LH IIIB2 (later than previously supposed); LH IIIC pottery was also found (Fig. 28). Fig. 27 J. P. Thalmann and M. Pierart continued their work in the Agora (AR 1980-81, I3; AR 1982-83, 25-6) to explore the arrangement of the C baths by soundings in the court of the stoa of Bath Building B, to date the C stoa and the A buildings which it succeeded, and to establish the history of the R race track in examining a possible starting line E of the square monument. These objectives were only partly realised: in the inner court of Bath B a huge Med pit had destroyed all C and HL buildings with the exception of a single wall which will be examined further. There was no trace of an A public Fig. 28 Tiryns. A G tomb was investigated S of the citadel in I975. The built cist contained the remains of a child, vases and a piece of iron sheet. Other vases were found above the sheet (ADelt 30 Chr 60).</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 23 Fig. 29 K. Kilian, for the German School, held a supplementary excavation season in the Unterburg in 1983 (AR 1982-83, 27-8 with references). A new trench was opened in LXI 42.43, LXII 43 (Fig. 29) (for the grid, see AR 1978-79, 19) to trace more of the earlier citadel wall, first identified in I982 (AR 1982-83, 27 ad fin.). Below LH IIIC advanced, developed and early levels without structures appeared a mudbrick tumble with traces of burning, associated with an early LH IIIC rectangular house, probably of the first building phase after the great earthquake (Fig. 30). There was an annexe S of the entrance. As well as Myc pottery, 'Barbarian' ware and 'Pseudo Grey Minyan' was found (the last copying standard LH shapes). Under this level was the destruction horizon of the major catastrophe (end ofLH IIIB2) (a Canaanitejar was found with it), with the three-phases citadel street which turns off to the E in the direction of the main street. Its W side was bounded by the stump of the earlier citadel wall. S of building VI was an open space in LH IIIB2, where a bronze-working area was identified. Fig. 30 This LH IIIB2 complex, contemporary with the construc- tion of the existing cyclopean wall had beneath it a rather poorly preserved group of rooms where an early phase of LH IIIB2 pottery was isolated for the first time. It has only a limited number of LH IIIB2 motifs, and seems to be an un- developed version of IIIB2. This complex in its turn covered a similarly arranged group of rooms associated with what seemed mid-IIIB pottery. In the SW corner of Room 214 Fig. 31 was a pithos, reused from an earlier phase. In the stone make-up below the floor of room 215 a 20 kg. rectangular copper ingot was found (Fig. 3I). At this time a mudbrick wall was built on top of the earlier citadel wall which, in its final phase, consisted of a stone socle o.8o m. high, average width 5.50 m., divided in Near Eastern fashion into a number of casemates of mudbrick, 2.80 m. wide, on the N/S course of the forti- fication. Below these features was a similarly arranged group of rooms with LH IIIBI pottery (Fig. 32). In Room 214 was the pithos, later to be reused. A feature in the N of the room may have been used for corn storage. In the middle of the room was a collapsed mudbrick-built oven. Fig. 32 A wooden-framed door, 2 m. wide, opened W into a small space between Rooms I90, 214 and 215 and the earlier forti- fications (Fig. 33). Nearby, five animal figures were found, including one with rider. Room 2I5 to the S had been partly filled with rubble. Almost in the middle of the room was a simple fireplace. A door with stone quoins in position leads from its SE corner E by way of a small corridor which to the</page><page sequence="22">24 H. W. CATLING building included a large stirrup jar decorated in light-on-dark technique, a crater with broad wavy line in the handle zone, and part of a Canaanite jar with incised syllabic signs on the handle (Fig. 34). Fig. 34 Fig. 33 S meets up with the open paved court found in I982 and also with Rooms 210 and 214 to the E. With the I982 Rooms 207-8 this gives a house-plan on two terraces, its main entrance in the corridor to the S, with a subsidiary entrance to the W. Finds from this house included a painted crater in R.207 and an onyx sealstone (goddess, griffon). The house was destroyed in an earthquake; simultaneously the large blocks on the face of the earlier enceinte fell in and crushed the house's W wall. This house is built on the remains of an earlier one (of similar ceramic date, however) which is itself contemporary with the building of the earlier fortifications. Its foundations are cut into LH IIIA deposits. In LXI 44, below the fortification, is a LH IIIA2 corridor belonging to a house whose E rooms lay below the later house. The E/W wall between these rooms is on the same axis as the earlier building, though moved i m. N. This suggests that the building sequence here remained basically on the same plan from LH IIIA to LH IIIB (early). Below the IIIA building are still earlier remains associated with LH II pottery. There is then a sequence of floors with pottery of Shaft Grave date, of MH III and MH II. EH II levels lie immediately over bed- rock. In the N of the Unterburg, in the area of the N gate and main street (LXIII 34/5, S of the Byz cistern) a succession of LH IIIC and IIIB occupation levels was found, the lowest of which immediately covers the great blocks that form the floor of the Guard Room. No sign of violent destruction was found in any of the deposits S of the Guard Room. To the S, the central street was cleared of its I 5 cm. thick burnt horizon and the final LH IIIB2 road surface exposed. On the E side of the road, remains of a hearth fallen from the second storey of a In the W part of Casemate 14 is a roughly circular well-shaft 10 m. deep, with much domestic pottery of mid-IIIB and early IIIB2, including several hydrias. There was also a 'Barbarian' ware cup, ten restorable deep bowls, small jugs and part of a pictorial crater (deer). The well seems to have been in use before the construction of the IIIB2 citadel wall and the building of the terraced houses. It at first remained in use after the citadel wall was built, but once the syringes were completed in the thickness of the wall, and the extensive IIIB2 building programme put in hand inside the walls, the well was disused and filled with rubbish. The building phase was probably of relatively brief duration. Outside the walls, a trench was opened in LVIII.LIX 41 to examine the extent of the settlement on this side of the hill (corresponding to work done in I98I on the E side). As noted elsewhere on the circuit, the citadel wall's destruction was of Byz date. Starting at the foot of the citadel wall a round- bottomed ditch was discovered that extends to the W gate. There was A architectural material in its fill, but it is dated HL by pottery. This must have been dug as an outwork to protect the W gate when the U,nterburg was reconstructed as a fort. Remains of an A wall were found in LIX 40 which had been cut by the ditch. Its outer face had been constructed of orthostats. This wall had been cut into a G gravel floor, below which, successively, were a MG and an EG occupation level, and a contemporary mudbrick wall with stone course in front for use as a stormwater drain. The associated room of this house should have extended almost as far as the rise in the rock. On almost the same orientation lay a deeply founded PG house wall, pillaged in EG. It had a rich floor deposit of painted and hand-made PG pottery which should, by analogy with Asine material, be EPG. This appears to be associated with a mudbrick-built apsidal house, cut into a LH IIIC Late/Developed level. For a distance of 9.40 m. the ground in front of the wall contained no deposits. Beyond lay an open space traversed by a N/S gravelled road, i.8o m. wide, parallel with the citadel wall. West again was a LH IIIC Developed/Late horizon, overlying a LH IIIC Early deposit 0.50 m. thick, full of ash, and much material - faience beads including a small plaque decorated with two triton shells, glass beads, a violin-bow</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 25 fibula, fragments of two animal rhyta and the remains of 259 terracotta statuettes, composed almost exclusively of Psi-type figures, most of normal size, but three could be restored at 0.20 m. high. There is much variety in form and decoration. Several have painted necklaces, and should therefore represent deities. A unique proto-Phi figure with rather clumsy body and a Phi figure occurred, as well as fragments of two hollow figures that must have been up to 0.30 m. high. There was also an ivory figure, armless, with cone-shaped body, probably a Levantine import, recalling the type of figurines used as foundation deposits. Other types included a fragmentary chariot group, the fragment of another chariot box, a stag and seven animal figures. There were also six fragmentary thrones. That these were found below Casemate 7 is probably not chance. The material resembles the contents of Casemate 7 and must have been thrown out of that location (which probably played a religious role) at the beginning of LH IIIC. This is suggested, too, by the discovery of similar statuettes in the underlying LH IIIB2 level, together with a basalt blossom bowl, all probably representing a cleaning of the cult- place and disposing of the rubbish by throwing it into the open through the wall. This seems more likely than the existence of an extra-mural cult-place. Below these levels were eight more occupation deposits, consisting largely of stone and quantities of small sherds, of LH IIIB2, LH IIIBI and LH IIIA immediately over bedrock. All the evidence suggests there was an occupation site in the immediate neighbourhood during these periods. K. Kilian has summarized some of his conclusions at the end of the Unterbura project. He notes that the plan of the settlement within the Unterburg was considerably changed when the existing citadel wall was built, contrasting with the plan that existed with little alteration from LH IIIA until the beginning of IIIB2. And it is not simply that there is a new plan - the plan is a reflection of palatial planning and architectural development and embellishment (Fig. 35) that had turned its Mycenae shows that, new though the LH IIIB2 scheme cer- tainly was, it can be seen to be typical of the period. The great earthquake of 1200 and the end of Mycenaean palatial society were followed by the temporary structures erected by the survivors in LH IIIC Early followed by a fresh radical re- designing of the heart of the Tiryns settlement which had very little regard for tradition, apart from cult-places, Priest's House and a Megaron on the acropolis. These post-earthquake replannings survived in essentials until the very end of the LH period. Then came another break, followed by another huge work programme at the beginning of the HL period, when the Unterburg was converted to a fort, and a fill 2.50 m. deep was brought in as levelling throughout the enclosure. It seems that the first, LH IIIBI, citadel must have enclosed a rather larger area than the IIIB2 fortifications. On the seaward side of the site occupation material was swept away to the rock; in the area of the Unterburg alone this means disposing of at least 350,000 tons of ballast. The evidence for the post-Myc occupation of the extra- mural area is to be added to the pattern of settlement nuclei of this period identifiable through the location of cemeteries (on the similar pattern at Argos) - SW of the Citadel, in front of the acropolis, to the W in front of the Unterburg, to which may be added the walls found in 1976. The A elements from public buildings - dedications, etc. - may be associated with the boustrophedon A inscription to Zeus and Athena. The narrowing of the main entrance to the acropolis at the same time as the digging of the ditch as an outwork for the W gate shows that the whole citadel was conceived of as a single fort at the time of that conversion. Fig. 35 back on earlier tradition. An instance is seen in the construction of the central street over previous house remains in the area of the N gate. In fact, Myc Tiryns as a settlement had developed on traditional lines from MH times onward; if there was destruction, then the rebuilding followed the example of the past; an exception to this pattern, of course, was the design and construction of the earlier citadel wall. The evidence of Fig. 36</page><page sequence="24">26 H. W. CATLING Asine. In I975, in the area of the Swedish excavations, a building plot produced two pillaged MH tombs; EH and LH pottery was found in the fills. The PR levels had been dis- turbed by a LR grave (without offerings) (ADelt 30 Chr 60). Palaia Epidauros. A. Archontidou-Argyri has reported on rescue excavations during 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 59-60. Levelling work at Katarachi destroyed the S wall of a sub- stantial building. A, C, HL and R pottery was found in the loose earth, as well as a bronze female statuette, Daedalic, of c. 600 B.C. (Fig. 36). On the W flank of the acropolis, in the Selas plot, remains of R buildings were found. A portrait bust of Marcus Aurelius was found built into a secondary wall. A built drain was found elsewhere in two different building plots. Spolia used in its construction included two inscribed tomb- stones. HL and R pottery was found in association. In the Mantzari plot a group of tombs, some cists, some jar burials, was found pillaged; the jars were HL and R. Two other graves were found elsewhere without goods, but with bg pottery and an iron strigil in the fills. ARCADIA - LAKONIA Lousoi. V. Mitsopoulou-Leon for the Austrian School in 1983 undertook the first excavation since 1898/99 (5Oh 4 [I90I] I ff.). Test trenches and squares were opened in the area of habitation, SW of the Sanctuary. In two terraces substantial remains of two houses were uncovered, between them a road and a large basin into which a smaller one had been built. Of the houses on the lower terrace a floor plastered with small clay fragments was discovered, surrounded by a band of mortar o.8o-I.0 m. wide -perhaps a dining room? On the upper terrace an impressive court was found, 5.55 x 6.o m., paved with slabs of local stone and surrounded by a Doric stylobate (Fig. 37). On a threshold leading into a neighbouring room Fig. 37 two Ionic bases were still in situ. The lines of the rooms of this peristyle house are to be seen in the grass. Pottery dates this building to the late HL period. These two quite well-built houses replaced older, smaller buildings with different orienta- tion, destroyed to their foundations. A third building phase exists above the peristyle house: a poor construction unrelated to the earlier building. This house had already been destroyed by the second half of the Ist cent. A.D. (pottery evidence). These first results are of interest in demonstrating the long life of the site. Bassae. According to Press reports in I984 it is intended to protect the Temple of Apollo with a lightly constructed roof (Eidiseis 9.2.84). Lykochia. In 1975 G. Steinhauer continued his study of a shrine on a hill overlooking the village, N of Megalopolis (AR 1978-79, 20). It is now seen (in the light of an inscribed perirrhanterion) that the shrine was dedicated not to Pan, as was originally supposed, but to Artemis. This may be the shrine of Artemis Kalliste referred to by Pausanias viii 35.8. It had two periods of activity: late 6th cent. B.C.-early 5th, and again in the 5th/4th cents, its prosperity in the latter of which should be connected with the foundation of Megalopolis. If correctly identified, the shrine also flourished under the tyrant Aristodemos. It may eventually have been destroyed by earthquake (ADelt 30 Chr 77-9). Analipsis. E. Krigas has published I Proistoriki Analipsis Arkadias (Thesis: Athens, 1983). Tegea. Y. Pikoulas has studied a relief of a warrior found in 1965 built into a recent wall, inscribed EXEMOZ, sug- gesting that this derives from a monument referred to by Pausanias viii 53.1o. The relief is work of the second half of the 4th cent. B.C., the inscription probably an addition of the ist-2nd cent. A.D. (Archaeognosia 2.2 [1981] 283-7). Megalopolis area. J. Roy, J. A. Lloyd and E. J. Owens with a third season's work in 1983 completed their intensive surface survey of selected areas within the territory of Megalo- polis. In a more extended report they write:- 'Field-walking was carried out in two areas, chosen to complete the sampling of Megalopolitan territory. In the main Megalopolitan basin an area of c. I2 km.2 was surveyed in territory belonging to the modern villages Ekklisula, Trilofo and Pavlia; this was chosen for comparison with those walked in I98I and I982 because it did not lie on a major ancient route (although it was presumably crossed by the road, described by Pausanias, from Megalopolis to Methydrium). In addition territory outside the main Megalo- politan basin (but still within the frontiers of ancient Megalo- polis) was surveyed for comparison with the land walked in the main basin. Several small sample areas were surveyed in or near the valley of the R. Lusios; these areas lay in the territory of the modern communities Dhimitsana, Zigovitsi and Stemnitsa, and amounted in all to c. 5 km2. 'The R. Lusios flows through mountainous territory N of the main Megalopolitan basin before joining the R. Alfios in the basin itself. N of the main basin the valley of the R. Lusios is very deep, very steep-sided, and generally very narrow. At some points, however, and notably around Paleokhori (a dependent village of Dhimitsana), the valley bottom is wide enough to allow more extensive cultivation. In addition side valleys also offer cultivable land; thus there is a field-system in a high and shallow basin around Zigovitsi, E of Dhimitsana, and another in a funnel-shaped valley E of Stemnitsa. These field-systems were surveyed, but produced no finds. The cultivated land near Paleokhori produced very limited C and HL material. The immediate neighbourhood of Dhimitsana, sited on classical Teuthis, was not examined. Despite the existence of Teuthis, the sample territories produced very little evidence of occupation at any period before the present day. This is in marked contrast to the quantity of material found in the main Megalopolitan basin in I98I-83. 'From the area of Pavlia, Trilofo and Ekklisula material was</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 27 discovered roughly comparable both in quantity and in other respects to that found in 1981-82. From the 12 km.2 surveyed in 1983 57 findspots were reported, on average 4.75 per I km.2, or slightly more than the average of 3.87 per I km.2 found in the 60 km.2 surveyed in I981-82. Almost all of the I983 findspots produced some material at least approximately datable, whereas some I981-82 findspots cannot be dated. 'The chronological spread of material found in I983 is comparable to those found earlier. PR material is very rare, although one site produced much PR pottery (possibly early EH) and some worked stone. 'The C and HL periods are by far the most commonly represented among the identified finds, if anything even more predominant than 1981-82. The findspots vary considerably in size, but it appears many would be best explained as dis- persed farmsteads. One large C site yielded fine and coarse wares of all periods A-LR, as well as evidence of a pottery- kiln; it is in the area suggested as containing classical Tricoloni but, according to Pausanias, Tricoloni was abandoned on the foundation of Megalopolis in the 4th cent. 'The distribution of C and HL sites between Pavlia and Trilofo is striking. Much of the landscape here is divided by large and deep gullies running roughly NE/SW, between which are well-defined hills; on the flatter tops of these hills and on terraces on their flanks there is cultivable land, and there are also on these hills readily defensible positions over- looking the surrounding countryside; but few findspots were recorded on the hills. Finds tended to occur E or W of the hills, or on less uneven ground near Pavlia and Paliomiri. The modern road avoids these gullies and hills by going E of them and it seems likely that any ancient route avoided them similarly. 'After the HL period, settlement in the area seems to have been much less. The large site already mentioned is one of only two in the Megalopolitan basin to have produced ER fine wares. A few other sites produced coarse wares. LR sites, though still rare, seem more numerous than ER. 'Byz and Frankish material was found at a number of sites, of which the most significant is at the so-called Pigadhie, E of Ekklisula. Limited excavation by Mme Karagiorgha in 1961 exposed part of a Byz structure. The site of the excavation is surrounded by a pot and tile scatter, in parts very heavy: it goes well beyond the excavated area, over some 25,000 m.2, and includes Frankish wares.' Sparta Museum. I. Makri has published a lead bulla, probably from Lakonia, with the name of Rendakios, who was protospatharios epi toln ikiakon. This Rendakios is other- wise unknown; the bulla may be dated at the turn of the Ioth/IIth cents (AAA I5 [1982] IOI-I4). Sparta. G. Steinhauer has reported on rescue excavations during 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 74-7; 79-80). On Odos Brasidou the plot was investigated next that where the 'Achilles in Skyros' mosaic had been found, to recover any remaining part, and to study the building to which it belonged. The NE corner of the floor and part of the geometric patternwork that bordered the central picture were found. The mosaic was seen to be later than the building to which it belonged; it had been inserted into a room that had been hypocaustal in its original form. Elsewhere, remains of the earlier building phase included painted wall plaster decorated with flowers and ?panels (76-7). In a building plot on Odos Triakosion and Xenophontos part of the ancient city's main thoroughfare was found. The road was 5.60 m. wide, lined on either side by stoas with poros stylobates, aligned NW/SE. There was an intercolumnar interval of 3.30 m.; the stoa was 3.60 m. wide. There was a substantial built drain on the E side of the road and, elsewhere, piped water channels. The use of spolia in the construction suggests this may have been a rebuilding of the city after some catastrophe - possibly following the incursion of the Goths and Heruli in 267. The reconstruction seems not to have lasted long (74). In a building plot on Odos Triakosion part of a lavishly appointed R house was found, perhaps of the 4th cent. Among its attractions was an internal fountain supplying two basins (one nearly completely destroyed by a Byz pit), and a room with mosaic floor and apsidal extension (also with mosaic floor) probably used as a dining room. The floor design places busts of Selene and Helios in a central enlblema (Cover) surrounded by the signs of the zodiac, enclosed within a guilloche band. The Four Winds are at the corners of the square within which this design is inscribed; beyond is a maeander border, then a complex guilloche. The dining room may be a late insertion (late 4th cent.) into a somewhat earlier architectural complex (74-6). During con- servation work in the ancient theatre, the LR nymphaeum was cleaned on the site of the skenotheke W of the theatre and at the same time the architectural blocks belonging to the R skene and the theatre seats put in order. Much architectural material and inscriptions were assembled in the orchestra. A previously missing fragment of the inscription of the epistyle of the final phase of the R skene was found:- -]OY KAI &lt;DA[ABIOY] OEOAOX[IOY which joins a fragment pub- lished BSA 27 (1925-26) 206. Three other inscriptions were found (two statue bases, one of Hadrian, a second of a pre- viously unknown corrector of the 3rd cent). A stele bore a type of dedication to Hadrian familiar in Sparta (79-80). Sparta area. The first season of an intensive surface survey planned eventually to cover an area of 150 km.2 between the Eurotas and the W piedmont of Parnon was undertaken by the British School in 1983. The project, under the overall direction of H. W. Catling, was led in the field by W. G. Cavanagh (Nottingham) and J. H. Crouwel (Amsterdam). They report as follows:- 'The area under examination in I983 was bounded on the W by the Eurotas, on the E by the Kelafina (Oinous) and on the N by the Sparta-Vresthena road. Parts of the village lands of Sellasia, Ayios Ioannis Theologos, Boutianoi, Kokkinorachi and Klada were involved. The areas studied contain a variety of terrain: fertile valley bottomn, much of it now given over to citrus cultivation; broken hill country overlooking the two rivers, and higher mountainous terrain, such as the mountain massif of Ayios Konstantinos, crowned by the site perhaps to be equated with ancient Sellasia. The changing pattern of settlement will be studied against the variety of these settings. 'Certain areas were found to be unsurveyable: vegetation in the torrent beds is usually so dense as to be impenetrable, and the thick maquis of prickly oak, thorn and similar shrubs proved impassable. Some hill-slopes have recently been mechanically terraced by the Forestry Service for pine- planting; this overturns the surface soil to reveal the bare rock below; experiment showed such terrain no longer responded to survey. '20 km.2 were covered, of which 6 km1.2 was unsurveyable. Within the remaining 14 kn.2 I45 sites were identified. Though the dates assigned are as yet provisional, it is clear very few locations earlier than A were found, while much the largest category were datable to C/HL. Mention may be made of some individual discoveries or recordings. The hill of</page><page sequence="26">28 H. W. CATIING Ayios Konstantinos, perhaps to be identified with ancient Sellasia, produced pottery of the 5th cent. B.C. to c. 200 B.C.; its circuit wall and the remains of houses within were studied. Nearby, Palaiogoulas, Ayios Konstantinos' main rival as the site of Sellasia, was also surveyed; it is clearly a village, and certainly much smaller than the site at Ayios Konstantinos. Some standing remains were noted at a previously unknown major settlement at Yeladari, beside the Eurotas; the site dates from A through to Ott. A LByz and Ott town was found at Chtoriza, beside the Oinous. In addition to numerous sites of farmstead size, more prosperous villas could be dated variously to C, HL and R. Several shrines, one with inscribed sherds, were discovered; they usually produce fine pottery of several periods. The sites of bridges that had spanned the Eurotas were located, and quarries where limestone blocks had been cut were found near the river. 'It is premature to interpret site location, though comparison with the placing of modern sites is sometimes revealing. Thus small C sites were found near modern winter sheepfolds in a setting that would suggest a similar pattern of transhumance in antiquity. Generally, areas of ancient and modern settlement tend to coincide, but there is a curious vacuum of ancient sites in the area of Kalyvia tou Theologou, perhaps an area too densely forested in antiquity for settlement. The ribbon- like spread of sites along the lower Oinous Valley shows the importance of routes of communication in this broken country. It is tempting to associate the increase in site-numbers and their prosperity in LC/HL with political concessions granted under the pressure of oligoawthropia.' Eparchy ofEpidauros Limera. During 1982 N. Drandakis (AS) surveyed the churches in the S of the eparchy, chiefly in the vicinity of Neapolis. The ruins of an ECh basilica were noted at Talanta (io kmn. WSW of Monemvasia). Wall paintings are best represented in the I3th cent., less so in the I4th. Though their style is provincial, their painters had evidently been well aware of the mainstream work of the period (Ergon 1982, 42-3). Mani, Kotronas. T. Moschos and L. Moschou have identi- fied the surviving defences of a fort (Palaikastro) which they attribute to the perioikic town of Teuthrone. Their analysis of the architecture of the fortifications, combined with a topographical study of the environs, associate this fort with Spartan defensive provisions for her S coastal territory during the first part of the Corinthian War (AE 1981, Chr 10-22). MESSENIA, TRIPHYLLIA AND ELIS Korone. The Greek Press in 1983 described the discovery of a bath-complex at Kastro in the village lands of Petalidhi (Akropolis 20.10.83). Voidikilia. G. Korres (AS) continued in 1982 his work at the complex of sites associated with the so-called Tomb of Thrasymedes (AR 1978-79, 20; AR 1981-82, 24 and references; AR 1982-83, 29-30). He notes that the N arm of the bay of Voidikilia reflects the same pattern of occupation to be seen on the S arm, site of the HL village and the Cave of Nestor, while the LC and HL cemetery has been located at Divari. In the main excavation area, in the NE sector the hollows beneath the floor of the EH buildings were examined and found to contain, inter alia, millstones, grinders, obsidian blades and earlier pottery decorated with relief or finger- pressing. In the SW sector work continued on the SW room, whose N and E walls were double (1.00-1.20 m. thick), standing four courses to a height of 0.70 m. The room has at least two phases, of which the upper was represented by a floor on which a millstone and animal bones were found. The lower fill contained many traces of burning. Some io m. E of the tholos a deposit of LC and HL terra- cotta votives was found, including some 200 plaques depicting funeral banquets, horse-and-rider (Fig. 38), scenes of dexiosis, Fig. 38 and worshippers. Small statuettes of men and women were also found. These objects belong to the hero and funerary cults not infrequently associated with tholos tombs at the turn of the C and HL periods (Ergotn 982, 4I-2). G. Korres in ADelt 30 Chr 86-96 has summarized results of his 1975 excavations at the Koukounara-Gouvoulari MH and LH cemeteries, the Kremmidhia-Kaminia complex and at Voidikilia (AR 1975-76, I5), other accounts of which have been given in Ergon 1975, 132-40 and PAE 1975, 428-514. Olympia. S. Photinos has published Olymnpia: Complete Guide (Athens, I982). N. Yalouris and I. Trianti have reported on work in 1975 on the pedimental sculpture of the Temple of Zeus, when a number of figures repaired in the past were partly dismantled either to remove oxydized metal ties or to add recently identified fragments (ADelt 30 Chr 97-8). The work of the German School in 1983 has been described by A. Mallwitz, whose efforts were again concentrated on elucidating the Imperial R history of the site in the area of the Leonidaion (Figs 39, 40) (AR 1982-83, 30). It was found that the N front of the SW Baths immediately adjoined and was aligned on a swimming pool, its courtyard and ambulatory on three sides. Three niches built into this N facade had been designed to hold statuary, arranged symmetrically around a door-like opening in the wall which was not, in fact, accessible from the swimming-pool; it allowed a prospect over the swimming-pool and associated buildings (Fig. 41). A flight of three steps led from the court to the swimming-pool. Everything was thoroughly well built. The bottom of the pool, the ambulatory floor and the surface of the court had all been covered with rectangular marble slabs, and the same material was used to revet the walls. The pool was served by a built drain that runs SE in the direction of the line of the</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 29 J ' : _ , ' --- I : Ff.... /... . . .

The Baths received fresh water supplied by a terracotta main coming from the direction of the 'water- tower' at the SE corner of the Leonidaion. The pipeline helps to date the SW Baths. It is earlier than Herodes Atticus' supply cf the 2nd cent., and was probably introduced in the ist cent. This harmonises with the evidence of a fragmentary console-geison found immediately E of the Leonidaion Baths, but probably to be associated with the SW Baths. The console-geison belongs to the same series as columns, bases and composite capitals reused in EChr times in the church in the so-called workshop of Phidias. The geison fragment is cut on a reused inscription, part of a large honorific text or dedication, LHL. The E wall of the swimming-pool ambulatory and court is later, when the walls were broken through for Drain 2 to pass beneath. This breach was subsequently resealed with . *&lt;</page><page sequence="28">30 H. W. CATLING Fig. 42 spolia, including a complete imperial R inscription (honorific decree of the Messenians for Lykortas, son of Teimokrates, archierieus: Fig. 42). Cleaning in the so-called 'Agora' S of the Leonidaion added little to the 1982 findings. The drain for the latrine on the SW corner of the Leonidaion is contemporary with the substantial R reconstruction in the Leonidaion - which may well have been contemporary with the building of the SW Baths. Study continued on the Bouleuterion complex. There had been no columns between the antae of the facade of the N building, apart from pilasters with anta-type capitals. The Ionic porch could be dated between the earthquake of 373 B.C. and the battle between the Elians and Arkadians of 364 B.C. (Io4th Olympiad). The spolia built into the porch belonging to the earthquake destruction and the absence of the linear ditches G5 and G4 inside the porch (ditches that were dug at the time of this fight [AR 198o-81, 21]) alike point to a date between the two events. In study of the Zeus temple, 338 of the original total of 450 column drums making up the peristyle have been identified and measured. New information on the columns' taper and fluting has been obtained. Entasis on the columns has been established for the first time. Ancient Elis. M. Koumouzelis has restudied the EBA grave found in 1961 near the theatre (AR 1961-62, 12) and argued both from the tomb-type and the two collar-necked jars it contained that the burial dates either to the end of EH II or to the EH II/EH III transition. SE European elements are identified in the complex (AAA 14 [1981] 265-72). N. Yalouris (AS) in 1982 continued his study of the area of Building D, where the construction sequence of associated buildings was clarified; these date from the Ist cent. B.C. until LR, while Building D itself is not later than the 3rd cent. B.C. Of the same date are two parallel walls, perhaps part of a stoa, belonging to the same complex as Building D. W of Building D a N/S road was identified, surfaced with fine gravel and tile fragments. Its W kerb was found, with at least two structural phases, of which the later is LR. The built conduit found in I98I (contemporary with Building D) is directly connected with this road (Ergon 1982, 40-I). ACHAEA Patras. A. A. Maraslis has published his Istoria tis Patras: I Exelixi mias protoporiakis polis (Patras, 1983). In 1983 the Greek Press reported discovery of a R public building on Ayios Yeoryios and Hephaistos Sts, comprising a series of vaulted structures. The site, which is in the neighbour- hood of the Odeion, is variously described as an amphitheatre or a hippodrome (Akropolis 21.12.83; Mesemvrini I4.4.84). I. Dekoulakou has reported on a large number of rescue excavations undertaken in 1975 (for an earlier, similar account, AR 1979-80, 34-6) in ADelt 30 Chr 99-120. On Nikitas and Karatza Sts further work uncovered more of the houses either side of a street first identified in 1973 (AR 1979-8o, 35). The street is 5.o m. wide, on a NE/SW line. In the level it overlay was pottery from the end of the 6th cent. B.C. to the ist cent. A.D., including a fine Attic rf fragment (Oedipus and the Sphinx). The previously reported drain in the middle of the road extends throughout its length, covered with terracotta slabs and spolia. Part of a house with atrium was found on the E side of the road, including parts of rooms opening from the N and S sides of the atrium. The pool was faced and paved with marble slabs. Somewhat similar was a house found on the W side of the street, including atrium and pool. A distyle porch fronted the street, with immediate access to the atrium. The pool was marble-lined; against one face was set a base. One of the rooms had a mosaic floor; pottery of the ist cent. B.C./Ist cent. A.D. was found below a floor. In one of the rooms opening off the atrium, on the other hand, two late burials were found, one with coins of the 5th-6th cents A.D. (IO8-I2). On Karaiskaki and Miaouli Sts two neighbouring R houses of some distinction were found, overlying earlier remains (Fig. 43). One house had an open court leading into the atrium. Of an earlier phase were remains of a built altar and offering base below the atrium floor. In the Fig. 43</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 3I second house was a room with mosaic floor (figured and floral ornament). Other appointments included baths and lavatories. Pottery below the floors of these houses was of Ist cent. B.C. date. Finds included Ist and 2nd cent. mould-made lamps, a clay lamp mould with the factory signature KA]AAICTOC, the tile stamp OMIAOY and part of a grave stele, inscribed i]APATIQNOZ[ ]N (I)AAFPOY XAIPETE (I00-2). Remains of a large R Bath were found on Vyronos and Cheilonos Patreos Sts. The part uncovered was gamma- shaped, the two wings meeting in a spacious octagonal room, probably the frigidarium. The sides of the room opened either into semi-circular basins reached by two steps, or exedras. The walls had originally been revetted in marble, the floor covered with slabs, below which was a piped drainage system. A corridor led E to a series of three heated rooms, two of which were immediately above the furnace. Coins date the buildings to the 5th and early 6th cents (99-0oo). On Gounari St part of a R street was found leading to the sea, with build- ings fronting it to the N. The street had been paved, and had also a pavement 2 m. wide on the N side, associated with a water-main. There was a large brick-built vaulted drain on the S side, 1.90 m. high, 2.0 m. wide. The buildings on the street were of two phases, the earlier LR, the later Chr. The remains of a LR foundry included part of an iron hearth with three legs. The street itself seems to have been laid out in ER, on pottery evidence (I02-3). Part of another R house was found on Ayiou Dimitriou and Pantocratoros Sts; the pool in the atrium was faced and floored with hydraulic plaster. A mosaic floor in the portico had a geometric panel and (badly damaged) a panel with lion to left, and perhaps a second animal. An unexcavated part of the house lay beyond a marble threshold block leading from the atrium. Remains of an earlier building were found below the floor of the pool (Io8). A wine-press was found on Anaximandrou street to which three rectangular tanks, lined with hydraulic plaster (two with shallow hollows in the centre of their floors), and a complex of pipes belonged. The unit is post- 4th cent. A.D. Part of an ancient street and buildings of three phases were found on Miaouli St; pottery, lamps and coins from the successive deposits date from the 3rd cent. B.C. until Justin II (104). In Pantanassas St a two-phase building complex was found, the later associated with two well-heads. Part of a mosaic floor was found, the rest of which had pre- viously been discovered in the adjacent Tzelepi plot (I05-6). A complex found on Tsamadou and Ypsilandou included a courtyard paved with terracotta slabs with a built well in the centre, a cistern nearby and piped water-mains below the courtyard floor. In the associated fill was part of a marble R relief- bearded man to r., remains of a second figure whose left hand rests on the man's shoulder. I. Dekoulakou's report contains references to another eleven sites in the city where building remains were found, of slighter interest; the majority were found with piped water supplies, sometimes wells or cisterns; they appear to date from ER to Byz. Few associated finds of note were reported, but the hand of a marble statue holding a sistruni came from a site on Papadiamantopoulou and Karpenisiou (II2). On Korinthou St the remains of a nymphaeum could only be partly excavated. The bases of two pilasters were associated with the draw-basin; wall sur- faces had been revetted with marble, and the floor was marble- paved. No date is suggested (104). Discoveries were also made in the city's cemeteries. On Mesolongiou St a number of burials and the funerary buildings to which they had belonged were found (Fig. 44). In one peribolos, connected to its S wall, was a small rectangular structure below which were burials covered Fig. 44 by large curved tiles. The bones were in a pile, mixed with the offerings that included gold leaves from a wreath and three glass unguentaria. This type of burial has Italian parallels. Among finds were several glasses and terracotta lamps - the latter include one of the 2nd cent. A.D. - Leda and the Swan (II7). In Ellenos Stratiotou St a family funerary monument was found, comparable to others dug earlier in Kanakari St (AR 1979-80, 36). The walls were of rubble, faced on both sides with baked brick. Eleven burials (nine tile-covered) were found around the monument. One contained a coin of Justin II and Sophia (mint of Thessaloniki). Another had a coin of Patras of the time of Caracalla. A lamp of the Kallistos work- shop (2nd/3rd cent.) was found, while another grave contained two glass unguentaria and a hemispherical bowl with cut ornament (II3-4). In a complex of tombs on Zalongou and G. Olympiou Sts a vault was found built of rubble masonry revetted with marble slabs and floor with the same, in which holes had been cut. A marble slab on the floor served as a pillow. Other graves nearby, including tile graves, all seemed to lack offerings (117). Burials dated from the 3rd-6th cents in four adjacent built tombs found on Karaiskaki St. Terra- cotta lamps and coins were found. A series of minor burial monuments was found on Pokevil St, together with burials. Pottery, glasses and lamps were grave goods (I18). Nearly twenty burials were found in two burial enclosures and associated tile graves on I2th Syntagmatos St; there were few grave offerings (118). On Dimitriou St, two adjoining Chr burial vaults had clay tile floors (117-8). According to Greek Press reports in 1983, such discoveries continue to be made - part of the N cemetery was investigated, including the street through it and funerary structures of C, HL and R date (Kathemerini 30.7.83). Ano Kastritsi (9 km. NE of Patras). I. Dekoulakou reported the discovery in 1975 of a G pithos burial, the mouth sealed by a large limestone slab. A LG oinochoe was in the pithos (ADelt 30 Chr II8). Drepanon. A pithos burial (accompanied by a spearhead - date unstated) was found at the Vosinaki factory site in 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr I20). Mamousia Aigialeias. I. Dekoulakou reports the excava- tion in 1975 of a fine pi-shaped funerary monument with architectural facade (Fig. 45) (eight Ionic pilasters, with a false</page><page sequence="30">32 H. W. CATLING Fig. 47 d_, i:| .. ...~: ~::~. 47). The whole area of the monument had been used for burials in the R period, from the ist cent. B.C. to the 3rd cent. A.D.; abundant grave offerings included terracotta lamps (Fig. 48), pottery and glasses (Fig. 49), bronzes, strigils Fig. 45 i : door in the centre, and many architectural elements found di: : .. fallen in front of the building, including half drums from the pilasters, capitals and blocks with shields carved in relief from the frieze). Within the building two cist tombs were found B of which one (HL) contained rich grave goods including a gold wreath (oak leaves), a silver cup and dipper (Fig. 46), and pottery vessels. The burial is of the 3rd cent. B.C. The I second tomb was empty. Behind the monument a number of earlier burials were found, including a pyre of the 6th cent. B.C., a sarcophagus used for two burials, with which bg and rf vases were found and a AV coin of Sikyon of the Ist half i of the 4th cent. B.C. Another grave held a kantharos of West Slope style with barbotine ornament (3rd cent. B.C.) (Fig. Fig. 48 Fig. 46 Fig. 49</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 33 badly damaged a LH IIA-B floor deposit of vases, five of which were recovered, including a one-handled goblet decorated with inverted rockwork, and a second with ivy leaves (closely recalling the well-known example from Lachish = Stubbings, Myc Potteryfrom the Levant pl. XIV. i). In subsequent rescue excavation an undamaged part of the floor was found on which was a LM IIIB storage stirrup jar with octopus decoration (Fig. 5I). An earlier floor was located Fig. 50 and coins. A miniature bronze footed oinochoe came from fill (Fig. 50) (ADelt 30 Chr I20). Ano Mazaraki (Rakita). I. Papapostolou (AS) in 1982 returned to a LG deposit found accidentally in 1973 (AR 1979-80, 36); an area of oo m.2 was excavated to a depth of a metre. The material must have come from the sanctuary of a female deity, no trace of which has so far been found. Votives included many bronze ornaments, fibulae, rings, beads, spearheads, glass beads and iron objects. Most unusual is an ivory figure of a recumbent bull, on the underside of which is the figure of a goat in relief (Ergon 1982, 39-40). CENTRAL GREECE: BOEOTIA Thebes. K. Demakopoulou has reported in ADelt 30 Chr 128-33 on rescue excavations in the town during I975. On Pelopidou St, BA levels were excavated, a good deal disturbed by overlying HL structures, in an area near that part of the Myc palace excavated in 1964 (AR 1964-65, I5). Parts of two LH rooms were found with clay floors, and many traces of a fire destruction, including ash and remains of burnt timbers. Many terracotta roof tiles were found, of two types - rec- tangular with raised edges, and curved cover tiles. Pieces of folded lead sheet, or lead molten by the fire, were also found. Much LH IIIBI pottery was found in this destruction, includ- ing a Group A deep bowl. Several terracotta figures were also found, and some bronze objects. In a test dug below the floor in one room a pure MH level was reached where, on an earth floor, a group of eight MH vases was found, including a beaked jug with polychrome ornament. A child burial was found under the floor in a small oval pit, covered by a slab; the skeleton lay on a bed of pebbles (I 3 -3). On Epameinondas St somewhat confused architectural remains of the EH and MH periods were found, heavily damaged by overlying buildings; R and Byz walls as well as a water main were found built on stereo. Several EH storage pits had been cut into stereo. Part of a MH floor and associated pottery were found. A child's pithos burial (MH) was surrounded by a rubble wall, and seems to have been inserted in an area between buildings, rather than below a floor. EH and MH pottery, obsidian blades and waste material, a bone scraper, bronze needles and pins, a bronze ring and a marble bobbin- like object were found (128-30). Building work on Tseva Fig. 5I below, where LH terracotta statuettes were found; the thin fill on which this rested contained much LH pottery. In the same plot was part of a building founded on bedrock, associated with MH pottery (I30-I). On Pelopidou and Antigonis the LH levels had been much disturbed both by R and Byz building, and by modern basement construction. Much LH pottery was found in the disturbed levels, and a fragment of a heavy fire destruction in an undisturbed area of floor deposit; there were many terracotta roof tiles and fragments of monochrome deep bowls and Group B deep bowls (I33). In Amphionos and Dirkis Sts LH levels without associated buildings were identified, with much LH pottery, particularly LH IIIB. A large LH IIIB crater (partly restored) is unusual in having only banded ornament. A MH level was also reached, and below it another with EH II and III pottery - sauceboats and fragments of Ayia Marina style tankards (I33). According to Greek Press reports, a major EH building was found in I983, on the E side of the Kadmeion. It is rectilinear and protected by a sturdy wall. In the same area work con- tinued on the excavation of a group of LH III workshops; ivory, stone and clay objects have been found. Some SMyc tombs were found in the ruins of the Myc buildings, with a few vases and metal objects. Elsewhere, at several points, architectural remains and tombs of the MH period have been found (Akropolis 4.II.83). Tanagra. Four more tombs in this large LH cemetery were excavated in 1982 by Th. Spyropoulos (AS), of which two (nos 127, 130) produced significant material. T.I27 had a dromos niche near the stomion, sealed by rubble masonry. In the chamber were four shallow loculi, added after the</page><page sequence="32">34 H. W. CATLING CENTRAL GREECE: PHOKIS, LOKRIS AND PHTHIOTIS Polydrosos (Eparchy of Parnassidos). Ch. Arapoyanni- Mazokopaki reports the accidental discovery in 1980 of a LG tomb with three vases, two bronze bracelets, two narrow strips with pointille ornament, three stylised bronze birds and a bronze disk surmounted by a similar bird. One of the vases is a one-handled cup, perhaps Attic, late 8th-early 7th cent. B.C. (AAA I5 [1982] 76-85). Dhistomo. The Greek Press in 1983 reported the discovery of part of the ancient (fortification) wall (of ancient Ambrossos) as well as of the C and HL cemetery, with tile graves con- taining coins, statuettes and vases (Eleftheri Gnonli I2.IO.83). THESSALY original cutting of the tomb. Its long history was seen in the central pit in which offerings had been dumped, as well as a mass of bones and many grave-goods of LH IIIA and IIIB types. Among the many objects in T.I30 was a fine pottery kernos (Fig. 52) (Ergon 1982, 33-4). Gla. Further investigation of Building 'H' (AR 1982-83, 3 I-2) was undertaken in 1982 by Sp. Iakovides (AS) when the passage H3 and the SE room, H5, were excavated. The passage occupies the central long axis of the building, with a door at each end at the outside. Doors lead from it inside to the two pairs of rooms on either side of it. There is a marked slope in the bedrock, corrected by a stone packing covered here and there with yellow clay. The walls are of mudbrick on a stone socle; the bricks included chaff, small pebbles and many sherds. The thresholds consist of unworked stone slabs pointed with clay; the door-frames had been of wood. While the fill had much pottery, the floor of H5 was largely covered with ash including carbonised grain and grape-pips. Restored pottery included a dipper, a large amphora and the shoulder of a small stirrup jar with floral ornament. The pottery largely consisted of kylikes, bowls and jugs; it covers the LH IIIBI and start of IIIB2 phases, and dates the construction and use of the building to the first half or first three-quarters of the I3th cent. B.C. (Ergon 1982, 32-3). Orchomenos. Greek Press reports refer to the continuation by Th. Spyropoulos in 1983 of his excavation at the Myc palace. Finds include many fresco fragments (Avgi 28.9.83). Khostia. Work was resumed during 1983 under the direc- tion of J. Fossey (McGill) for the Canadian Institute with similar objectives and comparable results to those reported AR 198o-81, 22-3. A somewhat modified schema for a pro- visional history of the site's occupation has now been suggested. Deposits of PR pottery on bedrock include N and EH (chiefly EH I?); later PR material (EH and earlier MH) is not common; otherwise, a full sequence down to LH IIIB has been observed. There is no further occupation until LG. The walling styles date partly to A or EC (polygonal, some of the 'cyclopean'), partly earlier and later 4th cent. B.C. (coursed trapezoidal and ashlar respectively). The fortifications seem to have been restrengthened in R Imperial times after a destruction and abandonlment in the 1st cent. B.C. The R reoccupation may have ended in the 4th cent. A.D. Phthiotic Thebes. The exploration of the basilican church of Archbishop Peter continued in I982 under P. Lazarides (AS) (AR 1982-83, 34 and references). Four building phases have been identified in the bath-building N of the church. A mosaic floor belonging to the first two phases was decorated with intersecting circles. More of the mosaic floor found in I98I outside the N wall of the basilica was uncovered for a length of I9.20 m. The springs of the apse of the 5th cent. church were found; the chord of the apse is 3.80 m. The walls are covered with lime plaster; some of the marble revetment slabs are preserved in situ. In view of the many small tesserae found below the floor of the 6th cent. church, it seems the 5th cent. basilica was enriched with wall mosaics (Ergon 1982, 31-2). The Press refers to the discovery of part of the wall of Phthiotic Thebes with an associated tower, and a small three- aisled church which may belong to the time of Justinian (Akropolis 28.12.83). Pharsala. K. Galles has described 1975 discoveries in ADelt 30 Chr I94. The 4th cent. B.C. defences found in building plots on the Ayia Paraskevi hill had been extensively robbed of their stone. N and EBA pottery was found in the associated fills, emphasizing the PR importance of this part of Pharsala. At Gyphtovrysi, on the NW piedmont of the acropolis hill, a terracotta sarcophagus burial of the 3rd cent. B.C. was found. With the skeleton were ten unguentaria and a gold finger ring. Krini (io km. NNE of Pharsala). A. Tziaphalias reports the chance discovery in 1975 of a cemetery attached to a previously unknown settlement, surface evidence on which suggests HL and R occupation. Two inscribed grave stelai of the ist and 3rd cents A.D. were found, the former for EPIKTETOZ, shown as a mounted huntsman (Fig. 53) (ADelt 30 Chr I96-7). Atrax. K. Galles has enumerated a number of inscriptions, chiefly gravestones, found recently in the vicinity of Atrax, many of them from Mantria (W of the main site, Kastria or Mytikas); the stones have been transferred to Larisa or Trikkala. The majority date to the 4th and 3rd cents. In another area, where inscriptions had earlier been noted, a manumission of the 3rd cent. B.C. was found. The place of discovery is thought likely to have been the Agora of Atrax (ADelt 30 Chr 198-200). Krannon. A.

A. Kontoyannis has published an inscribed stele of the 2nd cent. A.D., found in I978 as a spolion in a foundation wall on the acropolis, for Phoibos, a gladiator, shown in relief on the lower part of the stone (Fig. 56) (AE I98i, 37-52). A. Tziaphalias has referred to the discovery at Exi Dromi of a fragmentary manumission document. An inscribed LR grave relief was acquired for the Larisa Museum (ADelt 30 Chr I97). Ayios Yeoryios Larisis. To the account of this important 7th-6th cent. B.C. cemetery already given (AR 1980-81, 25; AR 1982-83, 35) add A. Tziaphailas in ADelt 30 Chr 194-6. Four inscribed funerary monuments were brought to the Pharsala 'collection' in I975. They consist of a rectangular block with a pyramidal finial on the top of which a round hollow must have been the setting for some object connected with funerary cult. One was inscribed Ei MYAI[A], another A[X]IAIO0 (ADelt 30 Chr I98). Souphli Magoula. K. Galles continued work in the EN cremation cemetery (AR 1977-78, 41) in 1975.

Votives include terracotta female protomes, miniature vases (oinochoai, hydriai, craters), seated female figures, standing and recumbent male figures (ADelt 30 Chr 197-8). Vasilika. K.

Tziaphalias reports the accidental discovery in 1975 of a cemetery (largely pillaged) at Kastro (near the sea), suggesting it belongs to ancient Meliboia. At least one burial in a terracotta sarcophagus was found (ADelt 30 Chr 196). AETOLIA - AKARNANIA Strouza (Aigition). The Archaeological Survey School of Holland in Greece has been active here since 1981 (L. Bommelje, P. Doorn, R. Fagel, K. van Gulik, H. van Wijngaarden); a major objective has been the Kastro of Strouza (modern Aigition, five km. SW of Lidorikon) and two ancient fortresses in the immediate surroundings. In a more extended report they write:- 'The circuit-wall and the architectural surface remains of the interior of the Kastro of Strouza were measured and recorded. Architectural fragments outside the fortress, as well as some loose finds, were drawn and documented. A docu- mentation was made of the agricultural exploitation area in which the Kastro is situated. The ancient Greek fortresses on Mount Zerza and on Mount Bouchouri, both near the Kastro of Strouza, were measured. An historical-geographical analysis of the economy, settlement and communication of the Strouza region in the pre-war period was made. Ancient surface remains of G occupation in the region were plotted and studied in combination with the geographical data. 'The territorial morphology of the Ozolian Lokrians and the Aetolians in the research area were more distinctly established. 'The Kastro of Strouza is an Aetolian settlement; it is situated in the territory of the ethne-confederation of the Ophians, and not in that of the Apodotians as was generally assumed. This follows from the functional association of the Strouza area with the Steno area where Kallipolis is situated, the central place of the Ophians. 'The natural acropolis above the two Strouza sites occupies a central position in the visual communication network (mobilisation system) in the region. When the location of both Strouza settlements in the communicative traffic network is considered, as well as their position near the Ozolian Lokrian resource area, the Strouza location may be seen as a (military and economic) centre in the hierarchical relations between the mountain villages, preceding or subordinate to the great Ophian centre of Kallipolis. 'Aetolian Aigition was a polis in the 5th cent. B.C. The two ancient kastros of Strouza are consistent with what Thucydides says of the location of Aigition. It is therefore concluded that Aigition should be identified with one of the Strouza sites, and that it was an Ophian settlement.' Mytika. Excavation of the ECh basilica of Ayia Sophia continued in 1982 under P. Vokotopoulou (AS) (AR 1982-83, 35), when the paved floor of the nave was completely cleared, without finding any trace of an anibo (Fig. 58). Remains were found of a construction that had enclosed a part of the N aisle and the two areas of the N ancillary building that communicate with it. The E wall of the nave has a painted decoration in white and dark green, imitating the marble revetment which is actually in situ on the E wall. Much of the sculptured orna- ment of the church has been found, including an Ionic capital, fragments of the fenestrated chancel screen and part of the temblon (Ergon 1982, 31). Amphilochian Argos. Ph. Zapheiropoulou describes the discovery in 1975 of several cist tombs belonging to the very extensive, much robbed and destroyed cemetery of the city. Note is made of a number of inscriptions from the area handed to the Agrinion Museum; several are gravestones:- I: MAKA:/TPQIAAOZ; XPHI MOY/ITAAIQTA; KOtY(IA/AtIXYAOY (ADelt 30 Chr I75-6). THESPROTIA AND EPIRUS Arta (Ancient Ambrakia). I. Vokotopoulou reports the loca- tion of the city wall at two points in building plots in I975. On Porphyriou Mitropolitou St, the wall was 5.60 m. wide. On the floor of a later structure built against its inner face was pottery of 500-460 B.C.; the wall itself seems to date to the late 6th-earliest 5th cent. B.C. On Rogon St the part examined included an angle. The very heavy rubble fill within the wall faces was examined. An early 5th cent. B.C. date for the construction seemed likely from the pottery in the fill (ADelt 30 Chr 209-IO). Investigation of the LA temple (AR 1968-69, 2I) was resumed in 1975 after a long interval. Much C and HL pottery was found in fills, and a few terracotta statuette fragments, including an A kouros torso. 67 Chr tombs were found nearby, all without offerings; a terminus ante queni for the cemetery is given by I3th cent. Byz coins; part at least of this cemetery should belong to the Ott period. A pure C level was found below the burials (ADelt 30 Chr 2I0-I). E. Andreou examined an EHL house in a building plot in 1975, associated with an ancient street, the earlier of whose two surfaces contained A material, the later C. A LR water tank had subsequently been built on part of the site (ADelt 30 Chr 218). Nikopolis. I. Vokotopoulou has described conservation work and trials at the nymphaeum on the W side of the city, consisting of two pi-shaped brick-built structures with plain external facades and internal niches. These stood at the ter- minus of the aqueduct bringing water to the city from the Fig. 58</page><page sequence="36">38 H. W. CATLING Fig. 59 Louros, 5o km. away. They are on slightly different axes, and are 23 m. apart. It is doubtful whether they are contemporary; one may have been built in the early 3rd cent. A.D. A marble relief (symposium), probably HL, was found accidentally; it must belong to the embellishments brought to the new city from the older towns in the region that were forced into resettlement here (ADelt 30 Chr 214-6). Also in 1975 tests were made in the vicinity of the R built tomb examined earlier (AR 1973-74, 24) in search of similar features. Though no significant structures seem to have been found, quantities of R pottery (chiefly domestic) were recovered. A particularly fine lamp has a mounted Amazon in relief(ADelt 30 Chr 219). Kassope. The collaboration between the AS, the Univer- sity of Ioannina and the DAI continued in 1982 under the direction of S. Dakaris (AR 1982-83, 36, with references). Of the five houses studied, three (nos 6, 7 and 9) were examined inside, two (nos 8 and 14) have not been completed. There are two houses to the insula, 30 m. wide, divided from each other by a passage only I.o m. wide, used both for the drainage of storm water and household effluent. The houses date to the 4th cent. B.C.; alterations were made to them during the town's three centuries; no. 14 was completely rebuilt at the end of the 3rd cent. It seems to have been a public building, to judge from several bronze weights and many coins found in it. In the N Stoa (N limit of the Agora) (Figs 59, 60) tests showed that the public building of the 4th cent. that underlies it extends E of street 6. Enough architectural elements have been recovered to allow a paper reconstruction of the building's facade (4.63 m. high). Ten more stone benches (some with traces of 3rd-2nd cent. inscriptions) were found the length of the krepis. Notable is a stele dedicated by three soldiers to Herakles Soter, with a ten-line epigram in iambic trimeters. A fragment of a coin hoard dating to the R capture of I68 B.C. was in house 9, containing two drachmas of the Epirot League and a didrachm of the Akarnanian League (Ergon 1982, 27-9). Riza. P. Chrysostomou has discovered the standing remains of a brick-built ?nymphaeum two km. SE of the village at Phrangokklesia (Fig. 6I). The main structure, much over- grown, is in places preserved almost to roof-level. The plan is decagonal, inscribed within a rectangle 8.o X 8.20 m. There are'four niches in the N half of the building, two in the S. Above each niche is a semi-circular arch, designed at once as Fig. 60 Fig. 6I</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 39 Fig. 65 Fig. 62 Fig. 63 a relieving element and a decorative feature. The building may be of the 3rd cent. A.D., and may have been built on what was an aristocratic estate (AAA 15 [1982] Io-2I). Ladochorion (3 km. S of Igoumenitsa). I. Vokotopoulou in 1975 discovered a pillaged R mausoleum (brick and stone built), originally containing four sculptured marble sarcophagi. The looters had removed one completely, and damaged all the others (Figs 62, 63). The finest (late 2nd/early 3rd cent. B.C.) is decorated with Trojan War themes - arming of Achilles - mourning the dead Patroclus - Achilles exultant over the dead Hector (Fig. 64). Its lid had been crowned by a pair of reclining figures sculptured in the round, while the edges of the long sides of the lid were each divided into three metopes carved in low relief with Tritons, Nereids and Erotes on dolphins. The main relief on the second sarcophagus was a Dionysiac revel; on the opposite side, a crater between antithetic lions (Fig. 65). On one narrow side, Dionysiac, on the other, Erotes squabble over a palm frond (Fig. 66). The sarcophagi are now displayed in the Ioannina Museum (ADelt 30 Chr 211-3). P. Agallopoulou has described the secular building found in association with the mausoleum. It is an eight-room LR house arranged around a central court; part of the building has been eroded by the sea (ADelt 30 Chr 239). Polydroson. A bronze helmet of Etruscan 'jockey-cap' type in the koinotic collection has been published by A. Spetsieri-Choremi. Said to have been found at Zagora, it was used for years to take charcoal to the village church. Though cheekpieces of this helmet-type have been found at Dodona and on Kerkyra, this is the first helmet as such found in Greece. It may have belonged to the period of the wars of Pyrrhos, and have been brought to Greece by a veteran of those wars and eventually buried with him (AAA I5 [I982] 59-64). Ephyra. The AS and the University of Ioannina collabor- ated under the direction of A. Papadopoulos in 1982 on further digging of a building found in 1981 N of tumuli A and B Fig. 66 Fig. 64</page><page sequence="38">40 H. W. CATLING (AR 1982-83, 36). The building is divided internally into three main rooms of roughly equal size (4.67 X 4.65 m.), separated from the NE part of the building by another wall. The upper level is HL and overlies PR levels (Ergon 1982, 30). Dodona. S. Dakaris (AS) continued his excavation of building OI (AR 1982-83, 36) in 1982, examining its E half. The floors of three rooms excavated were covered by burnt material from the 169 B.C. destruction. The rooms, each 5.50 X 5.20 m., communicate with Building 0 by an entrance on the S. Finds include stamped tiles, a lead sheet inscribed AFAOTYXA on one side and on the other OVK ECaT &amp;crpxaelcx, &amp;dA' dcrrcoAoo-rt Tv-ra in 4th cent. lettering. A cast bronze griffin protome of the 7th cent. B.C. was also found. As previously suggested, the building seems likely to be a hostelry for the entertainment of pro- minent members of the Epirot League, whose floruit coincides with the construction date of the building at the turn of the 3rd-2nd cents. An alternative identity as Prytaneion is also possible, in view of the building's proximity to the Boule- uterion, and the discovery of such votives as the griffin protome, objects of a kind habitually stored in Pyrtaneia (Ergon 1982, 29-30). Ioannina. A HL bath (3rd cent. B.C.) is reported to have been found on the Kastro in I983, suggesting much earlier occupation of the site than previously supposed (4th cent. A.D.) (Mesemvrini 5.8.83). Kato Pedina Zagoriou (Nome of Ioannina). E. Andreou reports the chance discovery in 1975 of pottery and a bronze spearhead ('leaf-shaped'), suggesting occupation at the end of the BA (ADelt 30 Chr 218-9). Vitsa Zagoriou. I. Vokotopoulou has reported on work in 1975 (see, earlier, AR 1968-69, 22; AR 1969-70, I8; AR 1970-71, I8; AR 1973-74, 24; AR 1976-77, 43; AR 1979-80, 42; AR 1978-79, 27) where, in the S cemetery, another G burial was found in defining the cemetery's limits. Two terrace walls were found partly to overlie G burials; one of these was a warrior grave with spearhead. Work in the settlement concentrated on House Z, apsidal, 6.60 X 13.50 m., with built hearth on axis. There were 4th cent. B.C. sherds in the floor make-up. The house plan had originally been apsidal at each end (ADelt 30 Chr 214). The accidental discovery of a bronze spearhead of Myc type and pottery of Boubousti form points to a BA complex in the neighbourhood (ibid.). Klithi. G. Bailey, on behalf of the British School, under- took a first season of excavation at a Palaeolithic rock shelter on the Voidomatis River to elucidate problems brought to light by the earlier excavations of E. S. Higgs at Asprochaliko and Kastritsa (AR 1981-82, 30-I and earlier references). He writes (in a longer report):- 'Klithi is in the territory of the village of Klithonia and is a natural rock shelter formed in the Eocene limestone of the lower Vikos gorge (Fig. 67). It faces almost exactly due S and is on the right bank of the Voidomatis River, near the monastery of Ayii Anargyri. It is at an altitude of about 500 m., and its immediate surroundings are dominated by limestone cliffs and steep slopes with the Gamila mountain peak rising to 2500 m. just NE (Fig. 68). 'Klithi is one of at least three rock shelters on the Voidomatis with evidence of Pleistocene deposits. The other two are on the edge of the Konitsa plain near the mouth of the gorge. I &lt;600m Â· Palaeolithic Rockshelter D- 600-1000m * Modern settlement &gt; 1000m A Monastery Fig. 67 Fig. 68 Surface finds of flint artefacts are frequently visible elsewhere in the area; the lower part of the gorge was effectively a single Palaeolithic site-complex. 'Klithi was chosen because of the apparent extent and depth of the deposits and the abundant surface finds. This, with its obvious attractions. as a comfortable and capacious shelter, suggests a good chance of recovering a full sequence of Palaeolithic material, including a Middle Palaeolithic occupa- tion that may have occurred in the hinterland. Its location is also of interest. Unlike the two nearby rock-shelters, which</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 41 Fig. 69 Fig. 71 face out onto the Konitsa plain, it is in the middle of a narrow gorge, and its immediate exploitation territory consists mainly of steep and inaccessible slopes. It differs markedly from Asprochaliko and Kastritsa which are at lower altitudes with extensive areas of valleys and plains within their exploitation territories. It is therefore in a distinctive environmental location close to the high Pindus which should highlight any functional contrasts in fauna and artefacts with the other rock-shelter sites. 'The shelter opening is 25 m. wide and 10 m. deep and the brow of the rock overhang is about 40 m. above the shelter floor (Fig. 69). The present floor is 30 m. above the river and is a flat-topped area 450 m2. This extends out beyond the pre- sent rock overhang and is retained by a modern wall, in front of which the surface slopes steeply down to the river and is littered with flints, patches of limestone scree and boulders. There are several active springs in the vicinity including one at the foot of the scree immediately below the shelter. 'The 1983 season was of relatively limited scope and was intended primarily to test the nature and extent of the PR deposits and their cultural contents. The best living area from the point of view of warmth and shelter would have been in the NW corner of the shelter. The deposits also appear to be thickest here, whereas the slope of the back wall suggests that bedrock is very close to the surface at the E end of the site (Fig. 70). A PR surface was found immediately below a shallow layer of goat dung. In at least three locations animal bones were still in articulation. In another spot two pieces of a broken flake were found together, and in a third area two burin spalls were found next to each other. This indicates a virtually intact PR surface over a large part of the shelter and one which has undergone minimal disturbance since the site was last abandoned by its PR occupants. The existence of such a deposit just below the modern surface provides an unusual opportunity to explore the spatial variation in a palaeolithic rock-shelter. 'The first season's results demonstrate that Klithi contains a rich Palacolithic deposit at least 2 m. thick (Figs 7I, 72) with a stone industry dominated by backed bladelets, a fauna dominated by ibex, and considerable evidence of personal decoration and bone work. The evidence is consistent with a late Palaeolithic date, perhaps within the period c. 20,000 to EAST FACING SECTION W33 W32 I W31 I W30 W29 I I L K E i 1 iL1 Goat dung &amp; humus 3 A.. _ Fine scree Coarse scree I Disturbed deposit +28 Spit number 8 Layer number __ Unconfirmed layer boundary m l Fig. 72 Fig. 70</page><page sequence="40">42 H. W. CATLING 12,000 years ago. There is every reason to suppose that the deposits go considerably deeper and that earlier industries remain to be discovered. On the other hand, the absence of any PR deposits of post-Palaeolithic date is surprising in view of the attractiveness of the shelter and its obvious value as a winter goat-shelter in recent times. This may be due to lack of sedimentation under temperate climatic conditions, removal of post-Palaeolithic deposits by more recent occupants, or a genuine hiatus in the use of the site. Very little post-Palaeolithic material has been found on the talus slope. A few potsherds have been found, together with modern materials, and none of this is inconsistent with an essentially modern or historical date. Absence of occupation for a period of many millennia after the final abandonment by Palaeolithic ibex-hunters is not inconceivable. In spite of its obvious advantages as a goat shelter the site is evidently in quite a marginal location for a 'neolithic' economy, since the goats kept in the shelter in recent years could only be maintained through the winter by the importation of winter feed, mainly barley. The general inaccessibility of Klithi may have made it unsuitable as a temporary animal shelter until the historical period and the establishment of the villages on the surrounding heights.' Florina. Work continued at Petres on the HL town (AR 1982-83, 37) in 1983, according to Greek Press reports. Four houses have been investigated; all have two building phases and respective destruction horizons. Among finds have been twelve terracotta female figures perhaps from a workshop in Pella (Ethnos 19.1.84). The Greek Press also described the discovery and partial excavation of a habitation site of the 3rd cent. B.C. 22 km. E of Florina, overlooking the plain of Amyntaion (Eleftheros Typos I2.I0.83). Oropos (Nome of Preveza). E. Andreou reports the dis- covery in 1975 of a rectangular structure of large cut limestone blocks, internally divided into three sections. Among associated finds was a terracotta cubical seal with a device on each face (bunch of grapes, spider, leaf, bull's head, star). The function is uncertain; the date may be 4th cent. B.C. It somewhat recalls the spring house at Lykosoura. LN sherds and chipped stone tools were found nearby (ADelt 30 Chr 219-20). An inscribed grave monument of the 2nd cent. A.D. was found in 1975 at the church of Ayios Ioseph (ibid.). IONIAN ISLANDS In Kerkyraika Chronika XXV (198I) 13-83 is a bibliography for the Ionian Islands 1965-68, compiled by P. Moschona and G.

Agallopoulou has reported rescue excavations in the ancient city during 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 237-8. In the Kanoni area, building remains were found on Parodos Vas. Pavlou, including part of a R construction of which more had been found in 1966. Traces of an earlier, perhaps C building were also found. A similar complex is reported on Phigareto St. A built well and part of a destruction horizon were found on Vas. Pavlou St. Near the Olive Institute on Dorpfeld St a previously known site was further explored and a R building was found overlying a HL predecessor. More recently, the Greek Press refers to the discovery of R buildings in the Kalavrentzou area in road works. Coins, terracottas, vases were found (Eleftheri Gnomi 16.3.84). A. Spetsieri-Choremi has published a pot-hoard of 157 AR Kerkyrian staters and one drachima found in 1978 in test excavations in the Metallinou-Vlachopoulou plot, Stratia, an area of the ancient city in which there are known to exist a sanctuary, public buildings and workshops. The context is dated at the 6th/sth cent. B.C. transition. The worn state of many of the coins suggest this is a 'mercantile' hoard, not 'domestic'. Few coins of this type had previously been found in Kerkyra: others are known in the Asyut and Taranto hoards, in the latter of which is a stater from the same dies as one of the new ones (AE I98I, 52-73). Kerkyra: Mon Repos. Six A Doric capitals have been transferred from Mon Repos to the Kerkyra Museum; they were previously known, and four of them are described in Korkyra I (Berlin, I940) (ADelt 30 Chr 239-40). Kerkyra: Peritheia (N part of the island). A LR cemetery was identified in 1975 at Cheromylos, with a tile grave and cist tombs (ADelt 30 Chr 238). Lefkas. Vol. 5 of the Epetcris tis etairias Lcfkadikon Meleton 1978-80 (publ. 1982) contains a series of papers given in honour of the memory of Wilhelm D6orpfeld and his archaeological work on Lefkas. E. Andreou has reported the discovery in 1975 of two EH cist graves (ossuaries) at Syvras (S central). One had part of a clay bobbin, two bronze beads and a bronze earring. The second had up to six skeletons and part of a clay bobbin. A ?G pithos burial, largely destroyed, was also found (ADelt 30 Chr 241-2). P. Kalligas has published the texts of four HL grave stones found in Lefkas for Kerkyrians; three are for women (Epet. Et. Lefk. Mel. 5 [1982] 75-85). CENTRAL MACEDONIA Makryialos (Ancient Pydna). Two Maccdonian tombs were found in 1983, according to the Greek Press. The first has a single vaulted chamber, and had been robbed. Among objects that survived were parts of the wooden doors, found in relatively good condition. A gold chain and medallion with representation of a woman sacrificing, and two gold earrings, were also found (Eleftheri Gnomni I4.10.83). The second tomb was apparently unlooted, containing a gold wreath, a silver kylix and other small objects. The interior was painted with a design of a room with various objects hanging on its walls (Eleftheros Typos 20.Io.83). A. Romiopoulou reported the discovery in 1975 at Karbounoskala of a group of ECh tombs in whose construction spolia had been used. Nearby is a partly pillaged cemetery probably of 5th or 4th cent. B.C. date (ADelt 30 Chr 250). Dion. A. Pantcrmalis has described his work at the site in 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 25r-4. He continued his excavation dur- ing I982 (AR 1982-83, 38 and references) for the AS and the University of Thcssaloniki jointly.

To the S excavation of the baths uncovered some of the heated rooms; clay 'bobbins' found may have been set in the walls for the circulation of hot air. Work in the Sanctuary of Isis attempted to clear and deepen the bed of the river which flows beside it. This revealed a complex of water pipes and tanks used to drain water from the Temnple of Aphrodite Hypolynpidia. On the E, the limits of the aisles were located, as well as the peribolos wall and the E entrance. In the remains of the walls of the S aisle planks and other wooden pieces of the structure were found. Outside the sanctuary a relief was found showing a pair of ears and a dedication to Sarapis, Isis and Anubis. The E defences were examined; a large part of the inner face of the wall was cleared, with an open space behind it. The tower near the marble gate in the wall was excavated. Part of the S wall was also examined and dated to the 4th cent. B.C. Work on the Great Baths within the city is nearly finished, with the excavation of the S wing and the uncovering of large heated areas, whose floors were carried on hypocaustal piers. This was the site of discovery of the fine statue of Dionysos and a satyr (Fig. 74) reported in AR 1982-83, 38. A new area was opened, beside the E Road, where a series of buildings was found, including shops and workshops. A fine portrait head of a philosopher of the 2nd-3rd cent. A.D. was found; it joins a damaged heri found five years before. The hcrmn is inscribed 'EpEvvaov6s (Ergoni 1982, 23-6). Accounts of A. Pantcrmalis' work in 1983 have been given in the Greek Press. The 4th cent. B.C. defences have been identificd beneath the R fortifications, while the central street of the city has now been cleared to its entire length, and some 20 other streets within the city identified. A new bath complex has been found in the area of the E street. The koilon of the R theatre has been clearcd, as well as the peribolos of the Isis Fig. 74 sanctuary. More work was done at the Demeter sanctuary, and a potter's kiln outside it (Makedonika, 18.9.83). The Dion Museum in 1975 acquired three inscriptions from accidental discoveries at neighbouring sites (ADelt 30 Chr 245). Pella. M. Karamanoli-Siganidou has described a series of investigations in I975, concentrating on the elucidation of details of the plans of buildings partly known from earlier campaigns, and investigating building plots in advance of construction, when parts of houses of the 3rd cent. B.C. were found and part of a street (ADelt 30 Chr 257-8). The same scholar has reported in Erxon 1982, 20-I on her 1982 investiga- tion (of which a Greek Press-derived account was given in AR 1982-83, 39) (Fig. 75, workshops; Fig. 76, bronze statue Fig. 75</page><page sequence="42">44 H. W. CATLING Fig. 76 arm - cf ibid.). The palatial complex covers 7,500 m.2; the great internal court is over I,000 m2. Within the very wide N portico, between the stylobate and the S wall of the rooms opening off the portico is a foundation of the same width and length as the N peristyle. At each end of the N portico is an apsidal space, of which the E (excavated 20 years ago) is considerably larger than the W. To the details of the Agora given ibid. may be added a date in the reign of Philip V, in view of the terracotta statuette types, stamped amphora handles and coins found in the complex. Some information about the 1983 campaign has been given in the Greek Press, which refers to the identification of a temple of Aphrodite and Kybele on the N side of the Agora, 9 m. long, 4 m. wide (naiskos), surrounded by a stoa. In the naiskos was found a small altar, and terracotta figures of Aphrodite and Eros. Near the naiskos were found the bronze fittings from a kline (horse protome above, youth's below) and the bronze handle of a volute crater, metal spits, pottery. In the same area a deposit of statuettes of girls, of Aphrodite and of Eros were found. 5o shops have now been identified (Makedonia 18.9.83). Mandalo (Nome of Pella). The Greek Press reports the discovery of a N settlement with houses built of pise. As well as abundant pottery, stone tools and terracotta statuettes have been found (Eleftheri Guomi 23.9.83). Sindos. With the completion of the excavation of this important and rich A cemetery (AR 1980-81, 29; AR 1981-82, 35-6; AR 1982-83, 37), A. Despoini (AS) has sought to place the site more firmly within its natural and human environ- ment. Her objective in 1982 was to define the N limit of the cemetery, and to explore its relationship with the nearby settlement site of Nea Ancliialos. The site was found not to extend beyond the new Thessaloniki water-main; it ceased to be used for burial at the end of the 5th cent. B.C. LN pottery was found in a deposit overlying bedrock in the NE section of this area; hitherto there had been no evidence for occupation earlier than the EIA. Such a N horizon has also been identified W of the lower slopes of the Nea Anchialos mound. Under the N level was found a gravel deposit belonging to an old bed of the Axios; it is hoped that future study of such riverine deposits may clarify the whereabouts of the ancient towns which, according to the sources, lay between the Axios and the Gallicos. Trenches dug on the E side of the mound found a dump of A pottery, chiefly local, but with some G and PCor imports from S Greece. There were also traces of metal- working. The excavator summarises her conclusions from three years' work: In LN there must have been an important settlement on the Nea Anchialos mound, whose activities extended S and W. The bed of the Axios was then well to the E of its present course, so that gravel from its alluviation reached as far as the mound. Only for the MBA is there no evidence of settlement. The settlement flourished in the IA, notably in the G period, and reached its peak in LA, the period to which belong the richest of the Sindos tombs. Decline followed the early decades of the 5th cent. B.C.; the cemetery reached its greatest extent in the last quarter of the 5th cent., in the area E of the A cemetery. Though life on the site con- tinued in the 4th cent. (as the four potter's kilns demonstrate) its peak had passed (Ergon I982, 23). Thessaloniki. A. Papayannopoulos has published his Istoria tis Thessalolikis (Thess., 1982) and B. Dimitriades his Topographia tis Thessaloniikis kata tin epochi tis Tulrkokratias (Thess., 1983). Archacologia 7 (I983) was devoted to the city, in a series of articles covering aspects of its history and develop- ment from antiquity to the present day. In the Museum, A. Romiopoulou reports that a number of inscriptions and sculptured gravestones, chiefly R, were acquired during 1975 from different areas of the city (ADelt 30 Chr 245-6). A. Despoini has published a bronze Cor helmet (No. 9130), probably found in the A cemetery at Nea Syllata, Chalkidiki, which she attributes to a provincial workshop, and dates to the mid-6th cent. B.C. (AAA 14 [I981] 246-50). Reports of discoveries in the ancient city and its cemeteries come from a variety of sources, including A. Romiopoulou's account of rescue excavations in I975 in ADelt 30 Chr 246-9. These are referred to by page reference only in what follows. In 1983 the Greek Press reported the location of a sector of the R and ECh defences on the E side, in the immediate area of the main hospital, filling a gap in the known lines of the wall between Ayios Dimitrios St and the Egnatian Way (Akropolis 7.6.83). Similar reports referred to the location of a tower on the E line of the wall during the work of restoration at the post-Byz church of Ayios Antonios (Kathemerini 19.6.83). Part of a sea wall was found on Proxenou Koromela St, dated by associated pottery to the 5th cent. A.D. (264). On Christopoulou St were found building remains of a private house whose rooms were arranged round a central court in which was a built well. There was a drain beside the house, running under a paved street. Below two distinct R phases of construction was an HL occupation level with much bg pottery and Megarian bowls, as well as some 4th cent. B.C. pottery (247). 5.0 m. below modern surface on Valaoritou and Orphanidou Sts a LR building complex was found, with</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 45 Fig. 77 which were a Corinthian capital and an Ionic column base (246-7). Equally deeply buried was a complex found on Egnatia St where the later of two successive floors was Chr (246). On Ayios Dimitrios St a tall rectangular plinth standing on a base of six steps was examined. It may once have sup- ported a column, the whole a monument to some important event. The bases had always been above ground (Fig. 77), but have had to be moved to facilitate circulation (Fig. 78) (247). Conservation at the church of the Metamorphosis (in progress since 1981) has revealed I4th cent. wall-paintings in the dome. An intact burial accompanied by two Byz plates was found in the S apse, a second in the N apse and a lead reliquary at the base of the altar (Akropolis 24.6.83). The Press reports the discovery in 1983 at the White Tower (during conservation work) of a tunnel below floor level leading in the direction of the sea (Kathemerini 4.I.84). E. Marki-Angelkou has described the discovery in 1980 and I98I during construction works on 3rd September St of a mortuary basilican church, a cruciform martyrion, and a com- plex of built tombs, all of the late 4th and 5th cents, outside the E wall of the ancient city. Brief accounts had previously appeared in the Greek Press (AR 1980-81, 29). The martyrion should be dated to the reign of Theodosios I (379-95); it contained ten tombs in addition to the primary grave. These may be tombs of the Bishops of Thessaloniki. The complex was probably destroyed in 618. The earlier suggestion that this could be the martyrion of Ayia Anysia is corrected in favour of Ayios Alexander. The 58 tombs outside the martyrion and basilica illustrate the custom of burial ad sanctos. In several cases the plastered surfaces of these tombs have painted orna- ment (AE 1981 Chr 53-69). E. Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou has described the silver reliquary found in situ in the chancel of the mortuary basilica (Fig. 79), perhaps immediately beneath the altar. The reliquary, which had been placed in a marble larnax, was an oval box with domed lid bearing the Chi-Rho monogram, with an incised inscription on the underside recording the weight of the reliquary (AE I98I Chr 70-8I). D. Evgenidou has studied a group of 77 coins found in associa- tion with the reliquary with a date-range mid-4th/mid-sth cents A.D. This is not a hoard in the normal sense; it may have been associated in some fashion with martyr-cult (AE 1981 Chr 82-5). On Langada St two built graves (?LR) were found in 1975 in an area where others had existed but been destroyed by later buildings (246). Thessaloniki - Agricultural School.

Romiopoulou) whose cover was a reused sarcophagus fragment with a Latin inscription. The date is uncertain. At the site reported AR 1974-75, 20, a further grave was found in I975, without offerings (ADelt 30 Chr 247-50). Torone. The activities of the combined Archaeological Society of Athens and Australian Archaeological Institute in Athens expedition under the direction of A.

Other recent Press reports describe work in 1983, when the N gate and a 70 m. stretch of wall was found. Part of the diateichisma was discovered in front of the gate. More work took place on the Via Colonnata, uncovering two more shops and parts of four others, part of the E stoa and a road running E at right angles to the Via Colonnata. A herm of Herakles, 3rd cent. B.C., was found with an inscription suggesting it had stood in the Gymnasium. Finds suggest the lower town was deserted in EByz times and reoccupied in post-Byz (Akropolis 6.I.84). Cemetery finds in the vicinity in 1975 have been described by I. Touratsoglou in ADelt 30 Chr 256-7. In the Longos area two HL chamber tombs with loculi were found, and a number of pit graves. The former had been used for successive burials, causing much disturbance. Finds included a pair of gold earrings with animal-head terminals, an AR tetradrachm of Lysimachos, pottery, bronze and iron objects. A group of ECh tombs were found on Kiuotacheias St, some of which were ordinary graves, others tile graves. Vergina. Work in 1982 undertaken by M. Andronikos for the AS and the University of Thessaloniki jointly was referred to in AR 1982-83. Further details have been given in Ergon 1982, 17-20. The investigation of three Macedonian tombs, commenced in 1981 (AR 1981-82, 39) continued. Tomb I has a built dromos leading to its Doric fasade (Fig. 81); the entrance was closed merely by a poros-built wall instead of the more usual marble door. Its prothalanmos has a flat roof; the painted ornament of the walls imitated stone coursing. The thalamos (with vaulted roof) was entered through a marble door; it contained a sarcophagus, its face carved in the form of a kline. Tomb II's facade was plain. It had a single thalamos, two-thirds of its space taken up by an enormous sarcophagus. Tomb III also had single thalamos; its unbroken facade is crowned by a horizontal geison. The marble door-frame is of excellent workmanship, re-echoed in the fine quality of the two leaves of the door that were found in the thalamos. Above the entrance to this tomb are the three painted figures referred to AR 1981-82, 39. It is suggested that the standing figure Fig. 81 represents the dead man, that the woman who hands him a gold wreath is either Arete or the personification of Macedonia, and that the seated figure represents the ideal of warriorhood. Within the chamber was a mass of poros and marble fragments, from which the thronos has been reconstructed. Its original position against the wall was identified, where there was a painted representation of its back-piece. The foot-stool that had belonged to it was also recovered. Tomb III is the earliest of this group (c. 300 B.C.); Tombs I and II belong to the second half of the 3rd cent. More work was done on Heuzey's tomb (AR 1982-83, 44), which has now been dated to the last third of the 4th cent., in the light of a Thasian amphora stamp with the name of the archon Krinomenes. An account is also given of the finding of the theatre, and of the naiskos with the Eurydika inscription (Fig. 82) (ibid.). The identification of this Eurydika with Philip's mother, though very probable, should still be regarded as provisional. In the theatre, while the E parodos wall is well preserved, only part of the E foundation of the skene survives. The foundation of the altar in the orchestra was found. The Greek Press reported in 1983 discovery at the basilica site (AR 1982-83, 44), of an inscription naming Eurydika daughter of Sirra (Akropolis 7.Io.83). The restoration of the parade shield found in the 'Philip II' tomb has now been completed, and it is now on exhibition in the Vergina gallery in the Thessaloniki Museum (Akropolis 5.4.83).

Elsewhere, on the S side of the town (SW of the Ch basilicas) part of an important HL house (2nd cent.) was excavated, including a room with well-preserved wall- paintings. The design included a series of rectangular panels (1.40 m. high) framed by Ionic columns (rendered in chiaroscuro) and a dado imitating polychrome marble (Fig. 87). In one corner a poros well-head was in situ, with deeply scored rope-marks. In the lower part of the room-fill was a mass of architectural elements. Fig. 85 the Gymnasium seems to have been on its E side, with its monumental flight of twelve steps, 8.70 m. wide (Fig. 85). 44.60 m. of the E side have so far been uncovered, 36.25 m. of the S side. A large rectangular open area within the complex was evidently used for gymnastics and games. Three points are of particular interest - SW of the staircase was a pair of rooms with slabbed floors, one of which was used as a bath; on the W side of the complex is a stoa with internal stylobate; it contained the bases of five herms, and a sixth found in the SE corner. The sculptured head of a wreathed athlete (ibid.) was found by one of the bases, while the head of a victorious athlete was found on the E (Fig. 86). The Apella inscription (ibid.) is dated early Imperial. Seven inscriptions confirm the building's identification as a gymnasium, including one of the gymnasiarch Antigenes son of Diogenes, cut on the herm. The building is HL in origin, remaining in use (with certain modifications) until early Imperial times, when it was destroyed by fire. Tests E and W of the gymnasium uncovered two R tombs, where wooden coffins had been inserted in lead covers. One had been pillaged, the second contained a woman's remains dated by coins to the reign of Hadrian; also in the grave were glass and stone vessels, gold leaves, a gold finger- Fig. 86 Fig. 87 The AV stater of Alexander (ibid.) comes from a 4th cent.

Ten burials were found; finds include a PCor aryballos, gold jewellery, bronze coins, weapons and tools of iron, including a knife with curved blade and bone handle decorated with incised circlets (Ergon 1982, 14-7). Pentapolis (Nome of Serres). D. Grammenos has reported a test excavation at an EBA occupation mound during I978. Structural remains were confined to a hearth and a rubbish pit.

A series of six C14 determinations (2350-3000 B.C., calibrated) combined with the pottery typology (chiefly monochrome polished and coarse) and other finds (flint tools, stone axes, loom weights, etc.) allow these levels to be equated with Sitagroi IV and V.

Examination of the building history of the theatre concentrated on the second diazoma (apparently added in R times), which remained untouched by modern restorations. The theatre seems to have been in use until the 4th or 5th cents A.D. A group of R tombs was found beyond the E extension of the city's limits. One group of disturbed sarcophagi included a small inscribed example:- C. PISIDIVS RVFVS/AN. XXIV H.S.E. A second group included 11 tile graves and a pit grave; there were very few offerings. In the W cemetery a group of 12 tile graves and pit graves covered with slabs and stones was found, dating Ist-2nd cents A.D. Among chance finds of inscriptions was an altar-stele:- I]OVI F]VLMIN[I MVNVS OLVSIVS MODESTVS Ch. Penna reports that a number of LR tombs were ex- cavated during 1975 in the E cemetery, some 400 m. S of the basilica extra muros. In the same area part of a monumental building complex was found including part of a porticoed street leading E to an open area, or court, on which were two rectangular bases (ADelt 30 Chr 306). M. Seve described the results of study by the French School in I983 of architectural remains in the forum. Work con- centrated on the paper restoration of the order of the E and W temples, including the reconstruction of the facade of the E temple. Though its remains are less comprehensive than the W temple, it can be seen quite closely to resemble the latter. A study was also made of the frieze blocks of the W temple whose setting had not been determined earlier. These blocks (of which there are many) form two series, one of which must be from the facade, the other from the lateral walls. This study is combined with work on the pronaos ceiling, of which some fragments of stone beams survive, all decorated with a simple channelling on the soffits, some with an 'L' section, which were supported on the lateral walls, the others an inverted 'T' section. The length of the frieze blocks on the facade only permits the restoration of two intermediary beams supported by the colunmns of the facade, on the founda- tion wall of the pronaos supported by the door and window framnes. The size of the door that results from this restoration is too great for its frame to have been stone; it must have been wooden. Other work in the forum was of a more general kind, allowing its general appearance to be envisaged, particu- larly that of the E and W stoas. Ch. Bakirtzis (AS) supervised in 1982 the continuing pro- gramme to complete the work of the late St. Pelekanides (AR 1982-83, 45), concentrating on the problems of the structural phases of the Octagon, and further excavation at the Episkopeion, where work on its N wing revealed a later structural phase. Beneath the later floor an earlier (4th cent. A.D.) mosaic floor was found, decorated with geometric patterns and stylised plant motifs (Ergon 1982, 14). Nea Peramos (Kavalla).

A useful account of chance discoveries of antiquities and topographic observations made throughout the region in 1975 has been published by P. Pantos in ADelt 30 Chr 303-5. Abdera. D. Triantaphyllos describes a number of burials (pithoi, sarcophagi and a cremation) found accidentally in 1975 in the area N of the city. One sarcophagus burial con- tained a gold coin of Alexander III (mint of Pella). Chance finds in 1975 from the Abdera area included fragments of grave stelai (ADelt 30 Chr 297-8). Excavation by Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki (AS) in 1982 revealed part of the ancient city wall beneath its Byz successor (Fig. 9I). A votive deposit found at the NW corner of the second defence contained many terracotta statuettes of a goddess of the third quarter of the 6th cent. B.C. to the transition of the 4th-3rd cents. This find supports the hypo- thesis that A Abdera lies well to the N of the modern shore line. Further details are given of the 7th cent. B.C. cemetery Fig. go</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 5I Fig. 9I attributed to the Clazomenian colonists (AR 1982-83, 46) found Ioo m. from this shrine (Fig. 92). 8I tombs were excavated, mainly pot-burials of infants; pottery included amphorae decorated with painted spirals on the shoulder, bird bowls, ring-vases with sub-G ornament and PCor aryballoi. Fig. 92 N and NW of the ancient city are many tumuli (up to 200 have so far been noted). Four were sampled at different points in the cemetery; the tumuli may either cover a single grave, or a number of separate burials. One excavated (A7) contained 45 burials (inhumations and cremations). The inhumations were found either in simple stone-built or tile graves, in clay coffins, or in pithoi. Others had been laid as they were on ground surface. The cremations had been carried out on the spot, above large pits cut into stereo (Ergon I982, II-3). Abdera: Polystylon. Ch. Bakirtzis (AS) in I982 began the systematic investigation of the Byz town (Polystylon) that overlies the city (AR 1982-83, 46), remains of its defences still visible on the low hill adjacent to the ancient harbour. In the area outside the walls where earlier work had located an extensive Ch cemetery (AR 1980-81, 34), a three-aisled basilica was found, with narthex, semi-circular apse and chancel, dating to the immediately post-ECh period. Inside the town, a single-aisled MByz church was found, remains of a cemetery surrounding it (Ergon 1982, 13). The Greek Press in 1983 gave further details of excavation in Byz Abdera. Further examination was made of the Ch cemetery surrounding the three-aisled basilica outside the W gate of the city, and the cemetery surrounding the single- aisled MByz church. In the latter 64 graves were examined; eight were found to contain wooden coffins. This was probably the main post-Byz cemetery of the settlement. The whole of the W circuit of the Byz fortifications was cleared; remains of a R bath were found inside (Akropolis 28.9.83). Maroneia. D. Triantaphyllos has reported chance dis- coveries in the vicinity in 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 294). Investigation of the HL and R theatre (AR 1982-83, 46) was continued by E. Pentazos (AS) in 1982 and showed the very mixed nature of the fill (4th cent. B.C.-Byz) right down to the level of the orchestra. By extending the excavation N and NW a considerable area has been exposed, including parts of three rows of seats (on some of which letters are cut), three sets of steps, and the parapet of the R theatre. Finds include fragments of statuettes, a stone throne and 12 coins of Maroneia of the 4th cent. B.C. (Ergon 1982, I3-4). Didymoteichon. Excavation continued in the site of ancient Ploutinopolis in 1983, according to the Greek Press, when Attic imports and stamped amphora handles were identified among the pottery. Work continued on a R public building (Vradyni I5.Io.83). Ch. Pennas reports essential conservation work on the mosque constructed by Murad I and his son Bayezid. Square in plan, with lead roof, it has a particularly fine wooden ceiling and excellent painted calligraphic inscriptions (ADelt 30 Chr 313). D. Triantaphyllos has described chance discoveries and topographic observations made at many points in the Nome of Rhodope during 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 294-7), and at other points in Thrace during the same period (ADelt 30 Chr 299-303). At Kalyva (Nome of Xanthi), a HL and later fort at the Kales hill was cleaned. The site is 28 km. NW of Xanthi, commanding the Nestos from Paranesti to Neochori. At Kirki (Xanthi) an inscribed base (2nd cent. A.D.) was found by chance naming 'Apellas' and 'Dorzi[n]this'. At Arzos (Eparchy of Orestias) a cist-tomb was found after the levelling of a tumulus 35-40 m. diam., 2.0 m. high. The burial was disturbed by the finders, and the grave goods removed. The skeletal remains had been partly burned. Among the grave</page><page sequence="50">52 H. W. CATLING Fig. 93 Fig. 94 goods was a bronze helmet of Chalcidian type (Fig. 93), an oinochoe (Fig. 94), a situla (Fig. 95) and a handled pan of bronze (Fig. 96), four silver vessels (Figs. 97a, b) and a terra- cotta lamp. The group dates to the later 4th cent. B.C. Mosunopoli (Nome ofRhodope). Ch. Penna has described investigation in 1975 of part of the fortifications of the town Fig. 96 Fig. 97a Fig. 97b known successively as Porsulis, Paisulai, Maximianoupolis, Mosunopolis and Messine-Kale. Mosunopolis was capital of the Byz theme of Voleros, covering an area of 400 stremmata (ADelt 30 Chr 311-2). Kerasea (Nome of Komotini). According to the Greek Press of 1983, the remains of a Byz IIth cent. church have been found which are thought to represent part of an extensive monastic complex that flourished in the Mt. Papikion area in the IIth and i2th cents. The church floor was of opus sectile (Eleftheri Gnomi 3.II.83). CYCLADES Andros: Palaeopolis. Y. Tzedakis has described his work in 1975 of cleaning sections of the surviving city wall (HL with R repairs), and the recording of inscriptions, fragments of sculpture and architectural members incorporated as spolia in more recent terrace walls and agricultural buildings (ADelt 30 Chr 323-4). Keos. An intensive diachronic surface survey of c. 20 km.2 in the N part of the island was carried out in summer of I983 under the direction of J. F. Cherry, J. L. Davis and E. Mantzourani, from whose more extended report the following account is taken. The primary objective was to obtain basic information on the spatial and temporal distribution of settle- ments in the island, in order (a) to place known PR and C sites, whether excavated or not, in their regional context, and (b) to test and further develop models concerning the deter- minants of patterns of settlement size, density and distribution at different points in Cyc history and prehistory. Until the inception of the survey there was no confirmed evidence of occupation of Keos prior to the final stages of the N period, for which three sites were known: Kephala, a settlement and cemetery, and two unexcavated sites, Paoura and Sykamias. The likely colonization of Keos at this time and the absence of earlier settlements conform to a more general pattern seen in the Cyc islands. Only a single BA settlement was known: Ayia Irini, on a peninsula inside the Fig. 95</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 53 large Ayios Nikolaos bay on the NW part of the island. In the historical periods of the 8th-2nd cents B.C. there were no less than four city-states on the island- Ioulis, Koressos, Poeessa and Karthaia. Although these states were sometimes bound together in a league, each often acted independently. As late as the 3rd cent. B.C., individual cities had their own coinage and legislative bodies. It was only after the R conquest of Greece that the more powerful began to absorb the two weaker city-states. In the ISt and 2nd cents A.D. only two or three Keian cities are mentioned by ancient writers and in the middle ages Ioulis became the chief town and capital of the island. Artefact density and visibility data were collected from a little under Iooo fields or groups of fields, and approximately 70 archaeological sites were examined. While in most cases these sites were previously unknown, a few can be shown to be places mentioned by earlier students of Keian archaeology but never studied in any detail; at least one quarter of these sites are presently threatened by the construction of new houses and roads. The earliest sites located during the survey are two small but dense obsidian scatters datable to the L or Final N, and thus roughly contemporary with the already known sites at Kephala and Paoura to which they are quite close; they are of special interest in view of the great rarity of such early sites in the Cyc. Obsidian occurs widely throughout the fields surveyed, but is not readily datable, and much of it may relate to agri- cultural activities of the historic period. BA material is rare and mostly consists of small quantities of diagnostic pottery found either in isolation or at sites whose pottery is pre- dominantly A to R. The general absence of substantial rural settlements outside the central place of Ayia Irini during the M and LBA is in harmony with the pattern in the Cyclades illustrated in the results of the Melos survey. But the fact that much the same sort of patterns appears to obtain during ECyc is both puzzling and unexpected, in view of the wealth of finds from this period on such islands as Siphnos, Melos or Naxos. Few surveys in Greece have recovered significant EIA material and Keos is no exception; even in LG it is only the acropolis of Koressos that shows signs of any occupation within the survey zone (although Ioulis, just outside it, is known to have much material of this period). The majority of the survey sites belong to the LA and C periods; well over 75 % of all the sites were in use at this time and few of them exceed c. one hectare in area, suggesting they are small farm-houses. Eight of them are associated with the square foundations of stone-built towers which, by analogy with other areas, most likely date between the 4th and 2nd cents B.C. It is clear that during these centuries (c. 7th-2nd B.C.) a strongly primate settlement structure obtained on Keos, with many small farming settlements dominated by the far larger urban central places of the city-states. This pattern seems to have broken down during HL and ER, for which far fewer rural sites are known and during which the synoikism noticed earlier was taking place. Again like many other surveyed regions in Greece, the LR period represents a peak of settlement density and the many stray finds of LR or EByz date in the fields testify to the intensity of agricultural activity in these times. After c. 7th cent. A.D. the settlement evidence becomes much more exiguous, although much work remains to be done in dating the post-R ceramic finds from the survey. Tenos. A. S. Lagouros has published I Istoria tis Tenou (apo ton archaiotaton hronoi ios simleron) (Athens, I983). Mykonos. D. Hatzi-Vallianou has reported finds of PR material at several points in the island during 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 327). Delos. According to the Greek Press a find of 14,000 clay sealings has been made in spoil from previous excavations. Some carry as many as 12 impressions; there may be as many as 60,000 impressions. There is great variety of subjects in the series (Vradyni 28.3.84). Rheneia. I. Zervoudakis reports the investigation in 1975 of two funerary periboloi damaged by the sea, the graves they contained having been pillaged. Finds included a fragmentary grave relief (woman, servant) (ADelt 30 Chr 325-7). Paros: Koukkounaries. The LH and DA settlement (AR 1981-82, 46 and earlier references; AR 1982-83, 47) was further excavated by D. Schilardi in I982. New trenches on the fifth terrace of the S slope of the acropolis uncovered a number of G house walls. Traces of a construction (G, or a little later) were found on the 'middle platform'. On the upper platform are the remains of a LH building 25 X 25 m., T-shaped, with a row of storerooms at the back. Under the floor of the first store is a rock-cut conduit covered with granite slabs. Below the floor of the second remains of a terrace wall in cyclopean masonry were found. In the main basement corridor the destruction contained a mass of shattered vases (deep bowls, one handled cups, kylikes, stirrup jars and jugs), some ivories and fragments of furniture affixes. At the NE limit of the plateau are the remains of a terraced building, evidently sited to control movements into Naousa Bay. The main occupation dates to LH IIIC, with G reuse. Below the house ECyc II pottery was found, proving the occupation of the site in the 3rd millennium. The head of an ECyc statuette was also found (Ergon 1982, 44-4). The Greek Press reported the discovery of an A cemetery in the vicinity of Paroikia, used from early in the 7th cent. B.C. until late HL. The burials were either cremations or jar burials (especially for children). A Melian vase I.0 m. high was found, perhaps important for localising the workshop where these vases were produced. Later burials were organised in periboloi, in built graves, or cremations. A large marble sarcophagus of the late 6th cent. B.C. contained several child burials; offerings included bronze and silver ornaments and much Cor pottery (Akropolis 27.9.83). Naxos. R. Trcuil (French School and CNFRS) has reported a topographic survey in 1982 and 1983 NE of Naxos town. The main discoveries, apart from a number of small PR and G sites, have included a BA settlement on the Kalamadiko hill, and a site of the historic period near the church of the Ayion Pnevma. Near Enkares (Mitria) the locations of earlier finds have been pin-pointcd, including that of IG XX 5, 53 and a sanctuary of the Nymphs. The valleys and lines of communi- cations into the hinterland have been examined in the NE area. A flint-implement factory found at Stelida in 1981 was further investigated. Naxos: Grotta. A full sequence of deposits in the Skordili plot was investigated by B. Lambrinoudakis (AS) in 1982, from G until reccnt times. In the S half of the site a complex of structures was found identifiable as a tannery, occupied in three distinct phases from the 4th cent. A.D. to the i4th. Below the late antique levels the standard early HL level was identified, containing G and A pottery from local workshops.</page><page sequence="52">54 H. W. CATLING At 0.80 m. below it a floor was found probably belonging to the PG house excavated further E in 1980. In the Potikian plot, Mesa Grotta, a building complex of several late antique phases was found, with parts of a court floored with simple mosaic and a large square well. A deep sand layer below these remains suggests that in antiquity the torrent bed was much wider than at present (Ergon I982, 45). Melos. Meliaka I contains a variety of papers on Melian topics (in Greek). These include G. A. Kallergi on 'The position of Melos in the Volcanic zone of the S Aegean'; N. A. Kephalleniadi, 'Account of Piratical attacks on Melos'; B. J. Slot, 'Consuls of the Netherlands in Melos and the Pilots'; S. M. Symeonides, 'The economy of the Latin Diocese of Melos 1642-1699', Z. Vaou, 'Traditional viticulture in Melos and Wine' and A. Lentaki 'The armorials of Melos'. Thera: Phtellos. M. Marthari has reported the discovery in a quarry S of Phira of a PR Cyc settlement, pottery from which is of ECyc-early MCyc types. The structures found are unusual - a round chamber connected by a short passage with a trapezoidal space, both of uncertain function, cut into stereo, apparently roofed with branches sealed with clay. Pottery fabrics represented include Cyc White and MCyc Burnished. The site is c. 150 m. from a previously reported (AE 1973, I6I-6) LCyc habitation (AAA I5 [1982] 86-IOI). Thera: Akrotiri. Ch. Doumas (AS) continued to prepare the site (AR 1982-83, 47, with earlier references) for publica- tion, concentrating on the West House, where he examined the small area on the upper floor between Rooms 5 and 6; this proved to be a small passage fitted with cupboards made of clay, seriously damaged by the roof collapse (part of the roof was actually still in situ). After this area had been con- served, it was possible to repair the E and W cupboards. Quantities of vases were found in the E cupboard (conical rhyta, fruit-bowls, 'flower-vases', nipple-jugs). Of note are four Cyc skyphoi with black burnished surface. Conservation of the frescoes found in 1981 in the area W of the lustral basin in Xeste 3 has made good progress, showing four young men holding various objects. Progress has been slower in the workshop in Athens where the Saffron-Gatherers from Xeste 3 are under repair (Ergon I982, 46-7). Thera: Sellada. A final season of excavation in the cemetery (AR 1982-83, 48 and earlier references) was completed by N. Zapheiropoulos (AS) in I982. In examining the slope beside the first sector of the paved road three ash-urns were found (a lebes and two unpainted amphorae). On one was inscribed the name BATIAAZ. In the SW part of Sellada I2 R tombs were found in the E part of the N sector. Glasses were found in two of them, while a bronze mirror, a small glass-paste pendant in the shape of a man's head and a ring- stone (bird) came from a third. Three pyres were found with pottery of normal type. A fourth pyre produced a most remarkable pottery house (?shrine) model (Fig. 98) and Ioo Fig. 98</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 55 Fig. 99 miniature vases, most of them found inside the model. The model is 0.6I m. long, 0.38 m. high, consisting of a large room entered from a porch through a wide doorway (Fig. 99). The entrance to the porch is flanked either side by a low parapet wall on which stand columns with Aeolic capitals. The model is covered with painted ornament that finds parallels on con- temporary Theran vases (Fig. Ioo). On one side, low down, are drawn two confronted monkeys (?men) and a procession of birds. On the parastades of the porch is painted the inscrip- tion 'ApX1iSKas Eic i Eycb - 'AvSpiacxs E ETroiE (Fig. 99) (Ergon 1982, 45-6). Yaliskari. Y. Tzedakis reports the discovery in 1975 of a pot-burial of a child of the last quarter of the 5th cent. B.C.; two other tombs were completely looted (ADelt 30 Chr 324). OTHER ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN N. Sporades. N. C. Moutsopoulos has published his Skiathos - Skopelos. Essai d'une etude de l'ecologie-sociale des ecosystemles insulaires des Sporades Septentrionales (Thessaloniki, 1983). Thasos: Theologos. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki con- tinued to excavate the PR settlement at Kastri (AR 1981-82, 48-9, with earlier references) in 1975, concentrating on a stratigraphic test to establish the site's full sequence. 1.50 m. was dug to stereo. Level A contained LBA and EIA pottery; the EIA horizon has been largely destroyed by cultivation; a LBA floor had hearth remains and traces of a wall. Level B was made up of superimposed stone layers and traces of architecture, including stone bases for wooden posts. Pottery is reddish brown or red, with burnished surface - shapes include shallow bowls with either inturned or outturned lips. Level C contains pottery somewhat similar to B, but also has graphite decorated forms on red or dark brown, red incised, or a combination on a red body of incision and added red - this recalls LN pottery from Dikili Tash. Levels B and C are seen as consecutive and belonging to Advanced LN = SubN = LN at Dikili Tash = Sitagroi III. The nature of interval between Levels A and B is unknown (ADelt 30 Chr 282-3). Thasos: Tsiganadika. The same scholar continued her excavation of this cemetery in 1975 (AR 1977-78, 56-7; AR 1981-82, 49). Among burials were T.I 5, a tumulus covering a rectangular space in which were found traces of a cremation. Grave goods included pottery and a bronze dagger; the hand-made pottery recalls material from the Kentria cemetery, among the earliest in this complex of cemeteries. A wheel-made vase in grey clay may imitate a Myc stamnos. T.I6 was a rectangular cist with two burials, hand-made vases and an iron dagger. T.I7 (Fig. IOI) was a double construction, Fig. I00 Amorgos: Lefkes: Ayia Eirene. L. Marangou has reported on her work in I980, describing in particular a num- ber of fragments of relief pithoi (Dodoni Io [1981] 491-502). Amorgos: Minoa. L. Marangou (AS) continued in 1982 her excavation of the temple referred to AR 1982-83, 48; it now seems certain that the building was distyle. New finds include fragments of marble sculpture, pieces of wall plaster, four fragments of lapidary inscriptions and pottery, G-R. Most of the pottery is HL bg and Megarian. In work in the area W of the temple and Building DI a fine terracotta head, 2nd cent. B.C., of a woman of Priene type was found. SW of this area six constructions cut in the rock were found, probably workshops. Most of the finds from this area were of late HL date, but some material was earlier. Study of the neighbouring area located an ancient building associated with a marble triglyph at Nero and, at Ayia Marina, two inscriptions, one of which completes IG XII 7, 260 (Ergon 1982, 47-8). Fig. IOI</page><page sequence="54">56 H. W. CATLING used for numerous burials; offerings included hand-made vases (plain or incised), bronze daggers and ornaments, clay beads. T.I8 was a substantial built chamber used for up to 80 burials, over a long period. Bronze daggers and two of iron were found. The earliest burials appear to be transitional LBA/EIA; the pottery recalls LBA material from E and Central Macedonia and S Bulgaria. The incised pottery of the upper levels in the tomb recalls earliest IA material, correspond- ing with Troy VII B2. Terracotta statuettes were a surprising find. T.I9 contained, inter alia, three bronze fibulae and an iron dagger. T.2o was a complex of several structures, the main grave containing a succession of burials. At two points dumps of pottery fragments (including pithoi) were found. T.21Iproved transitional LBA/EIA. A small, two-room R house was excavated within the cemetery (ADelt 30 Chr 278-82). Thasos: City. A. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki reports the excavation in 1975 of seven 5th and 4th cent. B.C. inhumations and cremations in a cemetery already partly investigated (AR 1981-82, 48, ad fin.) on the road W of the city. The burials were in stone-built cists; a fine bronze hydria was found with a cremation of c. 430 B.C., of the Group of the Siren Kalpides (Fig. I02) (Diehl, Die Hydria 35 and D. von Bothmer, Gnonmon 1965, 603) (ADelt 30 Chr 278). Fig. I03 contrast the levels over stereo contained only a few poor A sherds. G 15 could not be completely excavated; apart from A material in a sandy level below the surface soil a lower deposit contained 7th cent. B.C. pottery (Rhodian bird bowls). G 17 yielded 0 pottery in a near-surface level, over a deposit with little but coarse pottery of doubtful date. The complete absence of structures and the wealth of 7th and early 6th cent. material is a notable feature of these tests. F. Blonde, A. Muller and D. Mulliez continued to investi- gate the Terrain Valma in 1983 (AR 1981-82, 48 and reference; AR 1982-83, 49) where they studied the public area N of the Passage of the Theoroi (Guide de Thasos, 37-9). The round structure found in 1982 proved to be a well, 2.70 m. diam. internally, excavation of which was temporarily halted at the top of the destruction level. The construction date is not yet known. Associated with the pavement found in I982 are the founda- tions of a large building within whose perimeter was a solid mass of red clay mixed with marble chips, held in place by the lower courses of the walls, dating no later than the second half of the 5th cent. A.D. Up against the NE angle of the founda- tion rested a square-built well-shaft (found in 1982) further excavation of which yielded sculpture fragments and much late pottery. Fig. 102 J.-J. Maffre and A. Querel for the French School con- tinued their examination of the Artemision (Fig. 103) (Guide de Thasos Fig. 4 no. 5; AR 1981-82, 47-8 and references; AR 1982-83, 49), where a series of soundings was cut on the grid of squares within the peribolos established in I975. D II, E I2/E 13 were excavated to bedrock, and yielded abun- dant 0 pottery (including Cyc and Rhodian plates, Melian plates, Rhodian bowls, Ionian cups, small Cor vases in a mass of dark grey soil itself within a shallow fill overlying stereo). There was nothing Attic in the deposit, virtually no figurines (one found may be Lcmnian) and a Rhodian warrior-head plastic vase (Fig. 104). With the 0 pottery is a plate decorated with a duck with retorted head (Fig. IO5) and a Rhodian plate decorated in Wild Goat style (Fig. 106). A Cor aryballos is decorated with a panther.

This area was completely replanned at the end of the 6th cent. A.D. The large building was demolished to its founda- tions, and a thick sandy fill laid down. Thereafter, until the final destruction of A.D. 619, the square and associated road network ceased to exist. At first a sewer drained the Chr house (partly in a lead pipe) across the former square. This will have been cut at the time of laying an E/W drain across Pig. I07 the investigated area, other parts of which had previously been encountered in the excavation of the Artemision and its boundaries. Finds include a fragment of A kore and a sculptured headless akroterion (Fig. 107). The square well contained five heads, one of Severe Style, the others HL and R, including a Dionysos mitriphoros (Fig. 108). Among new inscriptions are two more fragments of the great list of the Theoroi, a sculptor's signature, an inventory fragment, two dedications, a block with magis- trates' names and herm-stela. J. des Courtils in 1983 worked on restoration at both the Herakleion and the Artemision; at the former a number of previously unstudied architectural fragments were examined. Thasos. Y. Garlan undertook further topographic study, recording a large number of rural sites, chiefly of the 4th and 3rd cents B.C., some of which must be identified as 'towers' to add to A. Bon's earlier list (BCH 54 [1930] I47-94). These results call for a substantial revision of ideas about the character of the Thasian chora. A fourth amphora factory (end 5th-3rd cents B.C.) was found near Kalyvia of Limenaria, at Keramidi, on the S side of the island. Among surface finds are amphora sherds (includ- ing some stamps), wasters, slag and kiln bars. Thasos: Palaeolithic finds. Nea of 2.9.83 reports a site with stone tools at Mavrolakas in the S, while Eleftherotypia of I.Io.83 reports mine shafts at Tsines, with two periods of use, apparently at the end of the Palaeolithic, the earlier of which seems to have been in search of red ochre. Samothrake. Greek Press reports in 1983 refer to the loca- tion of a BA settlement on Mikrovouni, near Alonia, occupied from the 3rd millennium B.C. to the LBA (Nea 21.6.83; Gnomi 23.6.83). Lemnos. In I983 the work of the Italian School (AR 1982-83, 50 and references) continued at Chloi where the poros foundations of the Telesterion of the Sanctuary of the Cabirii were uncovered. Material from the recent work at the sanctuary of Hephaistia was studied in the museum at Myrina; a Tyrrhennian graffito was found on a jug-handle. Pottery also includes several moulds and fragments of Megarian bowls akin to Attic types.</page><page sequence="56">58 H. W. CATLING Samos. I. Zervoudaki and D. Hatzi-Valianou have de- scribed rescue excavations of 1975 in ADelt 30 Chr 315-9. Near ancient Samos a two-period building complex was investigated on the shore. The later phase included part of a four-sided portico with paved passage on one of its sides. A dump of A and C pottery was found nearby (315). At Pythagoreion, in the Theophili plot, the lowest levels (containing a little PR pottery) were much disturbed by pits with LG and A material; remains of a LG building were found. In the upper levels were parts of R buildings and a R well. G and A pottery was found in the lower levels at a second plot, with building remains of more than one R phase in the upper levels. Elsewhere early HL structures were found, and a pit in the same plot contained burnt animal bones and LG and EA pottery (315-8). At Mytilinioi a previously unknown cemetery was found in road development, revealing funerary monuments and cist tombs. Finds of pottery and terracotta statuettes suggest the cemetery was in use in the late 5th-3rd cents B.C. A frag- mentary Attic rf crater of the second half of the 5th cent. B.C. was found. Nearby a habitation site was identified by surface finds of EA-HL pottery. Samos: the Heraion. H. Kyrieleis, for the German School, continued his excavation during 1983 (AR 1981-82, 49-50 and references). Work was concentrated in the SE sector of the temenos (Grid 0.13/14) where work had already been undertaken in 1977 (AR 1977-78, 58-60); the area already investigated was extended to W, N and E/SE. Apart from some Late Antique or Med garden walls, no post-A structures were found. This area, between the centre of the sanctuary and the sea, had been used as a rubbish dump since the 6th cent. B.C., seen particularly in a large mass of plain domestic pottery and animal bones. The water table was reached before the clearance of this late rubbish horizon had been com- pleted, and constant pumping was needed to reach the deeper deposits. Fig. iio An E/W street of the 7th cent. B.C. was found leading to the sea. It had been surfaced with a mixture of stone and gravel, in an area which had obviously been very marshy in antiquity. Beside the street two wells were found, partly enclosed by limestone slabs and flagstones. The construction was unusual; the shafts were lined with masonry, the well- heads were the upper parts of clay pithoi (Fig. o09). The drinking water which comes from a deeper-lying seam runs through an opening in the well-shaft in a short outlet channel of flat and upright stones. Much domestic pottery of types familiar at the Heraion, of the early 7th cent. B.C. (found with PCor aryballoi) came from these wells, as well as an important series of bronze, ivory, wood and terracotta objects (Fig. IIo), including a Fig. Io9 Fig. III</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 59 Fig. 114 Fig. 112 high proportion of imports from the Near East, Egypt and Cyprus (Fig. III). The context is a good one, and gives chronological precision to a number of unusual and important objects, among them a sheet-bronze relief of Herakles and Geryon, with the cattle of Geryon and the fallen Eurytion, two early sheet-bronze griffin-protomes, hammered (Fig. II2), a bronze stag statuette (Fig. II3), probably Near Eastern, a bronze (?Assyrian) rhyton with double lion-head, an Egyptian bronze situla (Fig. 114), the head and part of the upper body of a wooden female statuette of the early 7th cent. Below the water level was also found a series of wooden objects, including statuette fragments, pieces of furniture, ship models (Fig. 115) and others. Evidently the main access from the sea to the sanctuary in the 7th cent. passed this way; nothing of G date was found here. Fig. 113 Fig. II5 Samos: Pythagoreion. According to Greek Press reports, a HL building was excavated in a building plot near the Eupalineion and the ancient theatre with mosaic floors of exceptionally high quality and workmanship, of a class other- wise only known on Kos and on Delos (Avgi and Eleftheros Typos 23.9.83). Chios. C. Bouras published his Nea Moni on Chios; history and architecture (Athens, 1982). Psara (ten miles W of Chios): Archontiki (GAC 371). The Greek Press in 1983 reports fresh work in the Myc cist tomb cemetery on the coast three km. N of Psara village, when tombs threatened with destruction by the sea were excavated. A number had been used as osteothekes. Painted vases, bronze tools and beads of semi-precious stone were found. LN and EBA pottery was noted in the vicinity (Kathimerini 9.10.83). Other reports refer to topographic work in the island (Ethnos 14.10.83). Lesbos: Ancient Mytilene. I. Zervoudaki in 1975 investi- gated a building plot close to the R building earlier located (ADelt 28 Chr 515) and found an extensive paved area, either a crossroads or a small plateia, suggesting the ancient agora cannot be far away. Among finds are a headless marble draped female figure (R copy of a 4th cent. B.C. type) and a marble head of Melpomene, 2nd cent. A.D. copy of an HL original (Fig. ii6) (ADelt 30 Chr 314). Late 4th cent. B.C. terracottas and pottery were found when ten tombs were excavated in the known LC cemetery close to the city's C walls (ADelt 30 Chr 314).</page><page sequence="58">60 H. W. CATLING Fig. ii6 E. H. Williams, on behalf of the Canadian Institute, under- took topographic and geophysical studies in the area of the Med and Ott castle on the site of the ancient acropolis. He writes (in a more extended report): 'Remains of eight identi- fiable HL-EByz structures were drawn up and studied. Ele- ments from these buildings included Doric and Ionic capitals, architrave blocks, triglyph and metope frieze blocks, column drums and some wall blocks. Wall blocks from a number of other buildings were also recorded in the more than 2 km. of inner and outer wall faces that were examined. At least two of the structures identified were tombs, including a Doric stoa-tomb of late Ist cent. B.C. date that was identified by an inscription on its architrave (reused at some distance from the rest of the monument in an Ott fortification wall of the late i8th cent. in the lower castle) as that of Prota, probably the same lady whose epitaph by Crinagoras survives in the Greek Anthology. Another tomb, of Severan date, has unusual iconography with winged figures raising an eagle; it was probably Cor in form. Sections of a strigilated frieze from a building with an articulated facade like a nymphaeum or scene building were also noted. 'Most of these building remains were in one or other of the two local marbles whose quarries can still be seen near the villages of Moria and Thermi. At the much disturbed Moria quarries are large numbers of columns, basins, altars, blocks, etc. Andesite from the N of the island or from quarries across the straits in Asia Minor is also used not only for wall blocks but also columns and at least one Doric frieze. 'Significant results were obtained from the geophysical survey with Scintrex proton magnetometer and Bison resis- tivity meter in eight areas of the castle. Numerous linear anomalies were detected that probably indicate buried walls; a circular feature was identified with six linear features radiating from it. Tests carried out inside the inner ward and in the great undercroft and in the SW corner were inconclusive. Two different types of work were carried out with the resistivity meter: individual soundings to discover depth of fill over bedrock and traverses of larger areas to locate buried features. Results of the former indicated depths varying from 1.5 m. in the inner ward to 8.2 m. at the N end of the castle. Some traverses indicate hollow areas that may be reservoirs, cisterns, underground chambers, etc. 'A careful examination of the slopes S and E of the castle revealed traces of at least I8 ancient walls. As this area was kept clear for military purposes in the Ott period and probably earlier as well, the walls are likely to be no later than EByz and in some cases may be very much earlier. A wall of massive unworked stones was traced for 15 m.; it seems to have been a retaining wall, but could have been part of the early forti- fications of the hilltop. Quantities of LC and HL bg pottery (mostly Attic) were noted, as well as late HL and R wares, including Ephesos lamps and the first R Cor lamp known from Lesbos. Conspicuously absent were LR-EByz fine and coarse wares, which may suggest little settlement in this particular area of Mytilene after the 4th cent. 'Less material was visible on the N slopes of the castle, but an underground chapel appears to reuse an ancient bottle- shaped cistern. The E mole of the N harbour indicates that the ancient sea level was about 2 m. lower, and that a Doric colonnade ran along its inner edge. Some of the massive andesite blocks reused in the castle walls are similar in size to those in the mole and it seems possible there may have been some reuse of material so close at hand. Just NE of the harbour lie the extensive remains of a cemetery whose monumental tombs may have been carted across the bay for reuse as well.' Lesbos: Chorapha. I. Zervoudaki has reported conserva- tion work and further excavation at the 4th cent. A.D. building whose mosaic floors include scenes from the plays of Menander. Further exploration of the atritlm revealed two more panels with masks and an extensive rectangular panel with seafish amid which (on a much smaller scale) is a fishing boat and two occupants (ADelt 30 Chr 314). CRETE Private Collections. M. Tsipopoulou has published two nearly complete A relief-pithoi and the fragment of a third in the K. and M. Mitsotakis collection, dating them to the mid-7th cent. B.C., and suggesting they come from the same pillaged cemetery at Arkadhes as others in the Metaxas Collection, Thessaloniki, Jerusalem, Paris and Basle (AAA 14 [1981] 276-93). CENTRAL CRETE Herakleion: Chersonisos. St. Alexiou has described the continuing excavation in 1975 in the R cemetery where glasses and an AE coin of the Cretan League were found. The inscribed grave stones suggest a family burial plot which fell into disuse, the material from which was employed for the construction of the graves investigated (ADelt 30 Chr 340-I). According to Greek Press reports in 1984, the marble statue of a goddess or woman was found in a building plot (Ethnos 25.1.83).</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 6i Pentevi (between Herakleion and Knossos). A poros altar was found in 1975 in the remains of an ancient building of quarried blocks inscribed:- 'APTElISl EVXTI V Aiai5ouiEvo S OETTaAiCOKOU A stele with Latin inscription came from the same site:- EX AVG .....

An EM tomb was found in 1983, according to Greek Press reports (Eleftheri Gnomi 22.IO.83). Knossos. Public works in 1983 located more post-M tombs in the N Cemetery area (AR 1978-79, 43-58; AR 1982-83, 5I). Other tombs were found in the area of Fortetsa (Ethnos 22.12.83). Spilia (Area of Knossos). In 1975 a pillaged R chamber tomb with two pits in the floor and two loculi was excavated by A. Lembessis. Remaining offerings (glasses, coinsJamps) date use to the second half of the ISt cent. A.D. (ADelt 30 Chr 342). Epano Vatheias (Nome of Herakleion). The Greek Press reports the discovery in 1984 of a LM III chamber tomb at Sopata. Traces of blue pigment were found on the tomb floor and in the area of the burials, recalling similar practice at Katsambas, Poros and Knossos (Mesemvrini 26.1.84). Archanes: Turkogeitonia. Y. and E. Sakellarakis (AS) continued their investigation here in 1982 (AR 1982-83, 53-4 and earlier references) in two areas: (I) Tests made between walls A, K and I, and area 17 established a sequence of two Fig. 117 (LM IA and LM IB) destructions. Notable in the LM IA level were the many fragments of painted wall plaster, the large number of vases, fragments of stone lamps, of bronze objects, remains of tripod altars, items of rock crystal, all implying a prosperous area. (2) In area 17, scene of the previous year's discovery of the head and leg of ivory statuettes, it was con- firmed that these had fallen from an upper storey. New ivories, including two leg pieces, a hand and a head, all from different figures, came to light. 17 such pieces have now been found, belonging to at least three different figures (Fig. 117). Their postures suggest they might belong to a complex group for which the only parallel is the Knossian ivory bull-jumper. Fragments of burnt wood found with the ivories suggest that the complete figures may have had wooden torsos and ivory limbs. Finds of gold sheet and folded silver sheet may also be connected with the figures (Ergon 1982, 56-8). The Greek Press refers to the discovery in 1983 of a built altar in front of the facade of the 'palatial' building (Nea 3.8.83). Archanes: Phourni. Y. and E. Sakellarakis (AS) in 1982 worked at three points in the M cemetery: (I) between mor- tuary buildings 8 and 9 (AR 1971-72, 22) 19 prepalatial burials were found, in two burial levels. With the finds was a fine cylindrical ivory seal (Fig. II8). Mortuary building 8 was Fig. ii8 seen to have an earlier structural phase. (2) S of mortuary building 5, W of tholos Gamma, N of mortuary building 22, scene of the earlier discovery of Cyc statuettes, 40 such disturbed prepalatial burials were found with important grave-goods, including 85 vases, seven bell-shaped statuettes, seven animal figures and a bird, part of a zoomorphic rhyton. An anthropomorphic rhyton is of note. An ECyc marble statuette head and stone pyxis lid fragment were also found. (3) Mortuary building 21 (N part of the site) had many unusual features. It consists of a tholos-like underground structure, 4.10 m. deep, 3.70 X 2.50 m. in plan, reached by six steps giving access to a pit 1.90 m. diameter. It was full of stone, probably fallen from the upper structure; finds inside (obsidian blades, part of a stone vase, etc.) may well have fallen in from neighbouring structures; this perhaps also applies to the associated pottery, covering the whole M period. Though this seems not to be a mortuary building, its function is doubtful. It might be associable with the lustral areas within M palaces and settlements, allowing the oval form to reflect the standard tholos-shape for structures within the cemetery (Ergon 1982, 54-6). Ayia Pelagia. St. Alexiou has described work in 1975 at the HL complex (including an andreion-prytaneion) overlying LM IIIB and earlier remains. Of note is a bronze sauroteer</page><page sequence="60">62 H. W. CATLING with socket enriched by inlaid copper in simple linear patterns (ADelt 30 Chr 337-40). Klima Pirgiotissa (Herakleion). The Greek Press reported the discovery of a LM chamber tomb with five painted larnakes and twelve decorated vases at Ston Ellina (Akropolis I4.4.83). Trochali (Nome of Herakleion). The Press reported the discovery of a M rural site in a rescue excavation that un- covered a storeroom with six pithoi (Akropolis 28.5.83). Mallia. The work of the French School continued in I983 at several points. C. Baurain, P. Darcque and C. Verlinden continued to examine the NE palace boundary, where removal of the E enclosure fence allowed further study of the area dug in 1934 by F. Chapouthier, and it is to be linked stratigraphic- ally with a previously unexcavated area. Old excavation dump was removed from an area N of the palace in preparation for future excavation. Notable results include the discovery of some MM II walls standing immediately on an EM II fill of small stones with much lithic material. The abundant pottery included grey and black burnished wares, and material with incised ornament. The storeroom of I982 was further excavated; its contents include 20 pots (amphorae, pithoi, jugs). In a basement room further N were a small stone alabastron, two clay balls with two impressions of the same seal and ten wild goat horns. Greater precision could be given to the poorly preserved MM III plan and the extent of its floors. A fragment of ripple-ware basin was found. A causeway and terrace identified E of the palace may also be of MM II date. Chapoutier's area is more difficult to understand since little of it has survived undamaged; associations of walls and floors are unclear. However, the large E/W ammoudha wall of squared blocks was seen to have suffered a good deal of lateral displacement (?earthquake) (Fig. II9). S of this wall (built over the causeway) is a plastered bench and a rectangular stone base with an oval stippled area and three round sockets. These features belong to the penultimate architectural phase. Of the same date are carbonised wooden constructions, partly concealed by two walls roughly at right angles which, between the bench and the ammoudha wall, represent a final occupation. Fig. 119 O. Pelon continued his work within the palace in the vicinity of the polythyron III 7a (Fig. 120), in III 7b-c, IV I, IV 4-6 and below the portico on the N edge of sectors III and IV. This area had already partly been examined by F. Chapoutier in 1929 and P. Demargne in 1956. Examination continued of the Fig. 120 protopalatial system, when the SE angle of Room B was cleared below the floor of the lobby III 7b, and an additional semi-circular hollow found on the E platform (see the detailed account of work in this area in AR 1982-83, 56-7). A new plastered room belonging to the same complex was found below the N portico of III 7a, unquestionably of MM II date (MM II pottery includes part of a Kamares fruit-stand). S of polythyron III 7a and below the paving of lobby III 7b a first architectural phase of the second palace was recognized, consisting of an E/W wall that could be followed for 15.0o m., 1.70 m. wide, whose character and stratigraphy alike identify it as the MM III facade of the palace. The polythyron III 7a and its ancillary structures must be dated LM I. At several points in the newly excavated area there has appeared below the first palace structures an earlier level whose palatial character, too, seems hard to dispute. First identified in 1982, it seems to be of the final phase of EM. In collaboration with the Greek authorities, M. Schlnid has continued restoration work in the Palace and the area NE. Several areas of pavement have been lifted and replaced. Afrati (Eparchy of Pediadhos). At Orthi Petra a sarco- phagus burial of the 6th cent. B.C. was found in 1975 con- taining an iron knife and two vases (ADelt 30 Chr 341-2). Kato Syme Viannou. A. Lembessis has discussed evidence for continuity of cult at the M and post-M sanctuary, basing herself on excavation results up to I977. She publishes a series of period plans to illustrate the main changes in the shrine's physical character (AE 1981, 1-24). Prinias. The Italian School reported good progress in 1983 with the study of material from its excavation in the G cemetery of Prinias. Over 500 items have so far been processed. Gortyn. A. Lembessis has reported discoveries made in I975 in digging a trench for the OTE beside the main road from the 45.5-46.5 km. from Herakelion, including archi- tectural remains and fragments of sculpture. Notable is a headless marble statuette of Pan, R copy of an earlier original (ADelt 30 Chr 342).</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 63 A third season of excavation was completed by the Italian School in 1983 (AR 1982-83, 59 with references) at the Pervolopetra and Armi sites. The large tower at the meeting of the E/W with the N/S circuits was investigated as well as another 50 m. of the N/S sector. Both the latter and the tower contain two HL phases of construction. An outwork was identified to the N of the wall, on the NW slope of the Pervolopetra hill. Fig. I23 Fig. 121 In the area of the praetoritum (AR 1979-80, 5I) (Fig. 121) a control trench was dug to test the stratigraphy from the paved street on its W side and the fountain no. 4. A Byz house of two architectural phases was identified, one associable with a destruction at the end 6th/beginning 7th cents, the second with the final destruction of Gortyn c. 670 A.D. The final occupation period has produced fragments of painted pottery of a new class (Fig. I22). Fig. 122 Hagia Triadha. The Italian School continued work in 1983 in the NW part of the site (AR 1982-83, 57-8). A group of rooms was excavated that had been demolished to create the court of the Agora at the beginning of LM IIIA2. The plan has been completed of the complex of which these rooms were a part. MM III or LM I buildings were found in tests in the same area. Kommos. On behalf of the American School, J. Shaw (Toronto) conducted a further excavation season in 1983 (AR 1982-83, 58-9 with references). In a more extended report he writes:- 'Excavation in earlier years had been divided between the Hilltop, the Hillside (MM and LM houses) and the S area, where a Greek sanctuary was found superposed on monumental M buildings. With the M houses sufficiently sampled and indeed their study for publication well under way we could now concentrate on the S (Fig. I23). Here a few more outbuildings of the sanctuary were revealed, but more importantly the monumental M building T was traced more extensively. The latter's excavation involved deep trenches, for its floor lies almost 3 m. below the level of the sanctuary court. 'Some nine trenches of varying sizes were excavated begin- ning at the SW and extending to the E of the 4th cent. B.C. temple. Earlier IA levels were first encountered in all trenches, especially those SW of Temple C where a dump of G pottery from the time of Temple B was recovered. Of these three Greek buildings, "V" on the E is probably of the 7th cent. and may actually be an enclosure in front of a still undiscovered building to the NE. Near it was found a pit that may have melted iron, the study of which could add considerably to our knowledge of Cretan metalworking, an activity suspected to have been carried out in the vicinity of Temple B. 'The second building, Q, located some distance S of V, was massively built, 5.4 m. wide and with an entrance probably on the W. Apparently also of 7th cent. date, it provided little information as to how it had been used. The third building, W, consisted of a tiny room (I.88 X 2.I 5 n.) which in a period of reuse had been furnished with a central block, apparently serving as a table, surrounded by slab seats. W was apparently built at the sanle time as Temple C in the 4th cent. B.C., and during that phase it had a drain built into its E wall. 'The positioning of our trenches this year was determined partly by the sanctuary structures (e.g. the altars E of Temple C) which will be preserved in the future, as if on islands, at their higher level, and partly by our still incomplete under- standing of M Building T, the exploration of which was the primle aim of the 1983 campaign. This aim was only partially accomplished due partly to the fact that the dimensions of T are even more monulnental than envisioned. 'The first phase of LM I Building T, which probably func- tioned jointly with Building J on the W, featured a long build- ing oriented E/W. Portions of its N faqade, which runs under the Greek temples and which faces upon a broad E/W road leading from the sea on the W and then probably inland to Phaistos to the E had already been exposed in earlier years. In 1983 three trenches, one between the altars and the other two E of them exposed continuations of the same wall and road (Fig. 124). This facade, with its huge ashlar orthostates, is now known to be at least 5o m1. long, and it still continues E,</page><page sequence="62">64 H. W. CATLING Fig. 124 perhaps even beyond our property line. It is surely one of the straightest ashlar facades in M architecture. 'As to the interior of the building our knowledge is at the moment restricted to an area 6 m. N/S of parts of the facade where later remains did not interfere with digging. The plan includes a portico with five columns (intercolumniation of 3.27 m.) running parallel and to the S of the facade E of J. The portico is 27 m. long and 5.15 m. deep, opening onto a court paved with pebble and lime of which we do not yet have the S limit. Beyond the portico and after the area below one of the Greek altars, begins a series of spacious rooms on either side of an E/W corridor. The walls are excellently built and at points preserved up to 2.4 m. (Fig. 125). Further rooms, traced but still unexcavated, continue further E from here. Within one of the rooms excavated down to its hard clay floor was a deposit of LM I pottery next to a number of large fallen stucco fragments painted with a broad frieze of succes- sive bands in black, blue, red and white. 'The E rooms and the portico represent the original plan Fig. 125 of Building T. The rooms seem to have been abandoned in LM I while the portico was replaced in a second phase, perhaps still in LM I, by a wall which ran along the E/W line of the columns. Building J and a small area to the W are, by contrast to the areas just described, reused in LM IIIA2 when the level is raised dramatically and new walls are built, in some cases in connection with pre-existing walls. J, N and S then form a single spacious complex which does not seem to have been domestic. An intermediary phase is represented by an un- finished structure (R) built on top of the LM I court sometime between that date and LM IIIAI. 'The great size of Building T, which is similar in magnitude to the ashlar buildings recently discovered at Archanes and Kato Zakros, adds a new dimension to our appreciation of the Kommos site. In contrast to those sites, however, there is at Kommos a major contrast between the unpretentious character of the house architecture and the monumental quality of Buildings T and J. This discrepancy suggests that T's func- tion(s) may have been related less to the surrounding com- munity than to its strategic position next to the highway lead- ing to the harbour front.' Krotos (near Lenda Kainourgiou, Nome of Herakleion). Greek Press reports describe the discovery of a partly pillaged prepalatial tholos tomb with remains of over oo00 burials. The tomb's interior diameter was 3.50 m.; the wall thickness 1.40 Im., preserved 0.80 m. high. Among burial offerings were pottery vessels, three seals (one an ivory cylinder with design of animals), 1250 stone beads and 15 amulets (Nea, Mesenvrini and Akropolis 1.7.83). Krousonas (Nome of Herakleion). The Press reports excavation in a settlement of the 7th-6th cents B.C., where a number of houses were found. There were two instances of foundation deposits, where in a corner of the buildings in- volved a small pit had been cut in which was placed a small round stone slab on which stood a small vase. There were charcoal fragments in the pit fills. One of the houses was particularly well built, including a substantial rectangular room 10.5 X 5.0 m. Itself of 6th cent. date, it stood on the remains of an earlier building. Elsewhere an A dump was found with many complete or fragmentary relief plaques, Daedalic in style, representing a standing female deity. Others portrayed a standing nude female figure, others again a horse. All this material is of 7th cent. date. Part of the neck of a pithos was found with relief ornament; two naked men kill a woman dressed in chiton and peplos, wearing a polos, while a similarly dressed woman looks on - ?sacrifice of Iphigenia in the presence of Clytemnestra (Akropolis 17.9.83). Lasithi. EM and MM finds have been made in the Geronto- mouri Cave (Ayios Charalambos) in 1983, according to the Greek Press. An osteotheke containing 0oo crania was found at the same site (Akropolis 9.II.83). Lyttos. According to a report in Mesemvrini of 9.8.83 a research excavation was undertaken at four points in the ancient city in 1983. In the first, a complex of R shops and workshops was found, probably sited beside a street. Finds include a grindstone, iron tools, coins and vases. In the second, a succession of HL buildings was examined, to the earliest of which belonged a building with a large room containing a central hearth surrounded by four columns which may have supported a lantern for smoke control. This building con- tained abundant evidence of fire destruction, including burnt</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 65 roof beams and carbonised grain and olives. The building dates to the 3rd cent. B.C.; its destruction is perhaps to be linked with the sack of Lyttos in 221-20 B.C. by Knossos. In the third area part of a very large R building was found, of uncertain purpose. It opens onto a paved street, 5.0 m. wide. In the fourth area a large public building was found, perhaps a pyrtaneion or bouleuterion. Idaean Cave. Press Reports in 1983 described a second season of the reinvestigation of the cave shrine, under the direction of Y. Sakellarakis (AR 1982-83, 59), emphasising the very large number of objects recovered (8,500) (chiefly from already dug earth), of which 253 were gold, more than 200 ivory, 21 seals and,a great quantity of bronze, iron, stone, lead, glass objects as well as much pottery and terracotta (Avgi 1.10.83). Partheni (Eparchy of Monophatsiou). A. Karetsou reported the identification of M sites at two points in the vicinity of this village in 1975 (ADelt 30 Chr 343). EAST CRETE Sitia. N. Papadakis has published Sitia, fatherland of Myson and Kornaros (Sitia, I983). Kato Zakro. N. Platon (AS) completed his twentieth season of excavation in 1982 in the M palace and town. Results include (I) In the SE sector the enclosure wall was further studied, but the mass of masonry dislodged by successive earthquakes made this difficult, particularly in the area of the SW gate. Much MM IIIB/LM IA pottery was found. (2) Examination of the long E wall on the E side of the E wing of the palace showed it was in fact part of the enclosure wall of the orchard. In the same area a test was made below the floor of the court associated with the Room of the Circular Basin (?Throne Room), which produced Kamares-type pottery. (3) In the W court three successive surfaces of the first terrace were uncovered, in an area where an old palatial building had previously been found. Above was found the neopalatial (LM IB) terrace. Elsewhere, three successive ramps were examined which gave access to the NE area. The latest (LM IB) was poorly preserved, the second (LM IA) is paved, while the third (MM) is sited slightly to the E of the others. A valuable series of material was found in association with this structural sequence. To the N, two successive neopalatial terrace surfaces were excavated. (4) On the upper terrace more work was completed in Hogarth's House A, where excavation of the two earlier phases recovered much pottery which will elucidate the development of the Kamares style in E Crete. In the neopalatial levels the wells of two staircases were found. (5) Adjoining House A, the upper terrace of a neighbouring house was excavated, part of which had been dug by Hogarth in I9go. Pottery from one of its rooms seems Fig. 126</page><page sequence="64">66 H. W. CATLING to belong to an earlier LM IA phase. Under the floors of three of the rooms of this house were found building remains of the old/new palace period transition (= MM IIIA). The N rooms are poorly preserved, but the central area is occupied by a room with double entrance on the W and a central column (Ergon 1982, 51-4). Palaikastro. L. H. Sackett andJ. A. MacGillivray on behalf of the British School undertook in 1983 an intensive surface survey of the M town site at Roussolakkos (Fig. 126) with a view of defining more accurately its boundaries and identify- ing areas of particular architectural interest within it. In a more extended report they write as follows:- 'The architectural survey recorded a wide network of M stone walls, many of which were incorporated into later boundary and terrace walls. The walls were plotted on a new plan of the area. The completed plan shows the likely size of the M settlement at its greatest extent (during MM III and LM I) (Fig. 127). The occupied area is very much greater than that known from excavations at the site. The new town plan includes a number of houses on the promontory to the NE of the site and a line of houses along the beach to the E. All of the coastal constructions seem to continue into the sea suggesting that, as at Zakros, the present water level is much higher than the Minoan. The houses on the promontory and E beach probably represent a LM I eastward extension of the main town site. Approach routes to the town were observed on all sides. There is also a possible length of fortification wall with rectangular bastion on the E approach from Patema and the land route from Zakros. 'The survey of surface finds was designed to determine the density and distribution of ancient objects over the site. The objects were primarily potsherds. Using the balloon photo- graphs of Professor J. W. Myers the Roussolakkos area was divided into 98 zones. In most cases the zones were determined by field boundaries. Sherd density and distribution were noted for each zone as a whole and these were related to architecture, erosion and other features. In two areas deep ploughing had brought considerable amounts of pottery and other objects to the surface, Deposit A to the SW and Deposit B in a field near the E beach. 'Deposit A is an unusually rich quantity of MM III/LM I pottery including fragments of fine cups and jars. The bulk consists of conical cups and a number of openwork stands or offering tables. An almost complete conch shell was found. The position, apparently just outside the town limits, and the conch shell and offering tables may suggest a gatehouse shrine in the area of Deposit A. Deposit B consists of pottery found with building blocks and paving slabs recently disturbed by deep ploughing. It dates to MM III/LM IA and LM IIIB (Fig. 128); with stone tools and architectural fragments it suggests the presence of a house similar to those on the nearby E beach. 'A magnetometer survey was concentrated on the fields to the N of the excavated area, where roughly I3,000 m.2 were surveyed. A number of quite small features was detected which do not appear to represent a coherent structure. 'A study of the building materials at Palaikastro was under- taken by J. Driessen. While searching for the stone sources the ammoudha quarries at Ta Skaria were rediscovered 3 km. 0 50 100 150 200 m F- H -4 I 1 1 Fig. 127</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1983-84 67 Fig. 128 Fig. 129 SE of Roussolakkos. There are five major quarried areas at Ta Skaria and traces of stone-cutting on the nearby ridges. The site must be one of the largest known M quarries. A M mason's mark was found cut into a vertical quarried face (Fig. I29). It is the first evidence which may prove the link between the use of mason's marks and the extraction of stone.' Vasiliki. The work of A. Zoes (AS) in 1982 (AR 1982-83, 59 and earlier references) was confined to a number of tests designed as checks on earlier results, as controls on M building techniques, as a check on the reuse of building materials and the consequent possible confusion for normal dating methods by masonry styles, and as a means of establishing a more reliable chronology and classification of building techniques (Ergon I982, 48-51). Hierapetra. K. Davaras has reported rescue excavations in 1975 in building plots in the area of ancient Hierapydna. A number of R buildings were found, including one incorporat- ing tanks lined with hydraulic cement which may have been used in some industrial process. Elsewhere a set of eight pithoi were found built into a masonry bench (ADelt 30 Chr 349-5I). Kouphonisi. N. Papadakis in I983 published an account of his work on this deserted islet off the SE coast (AR 1977-78, 67; AR 1978-79, 40). The island's ancient name appears to have been Lefki. In addition to the theatre previously noticed an eight-roomed house has been investigated that fronts a street leading from the theatre. It was entered through a porch supported on rectangular piers crowned with Ionic capitals. Two rooms were floored with pebble mosaics decorated with simple linear patterns. The main settlement was found some 200 m. from the theatre, where a nine-room house was excavated. Finds of net weights and quantities of sea shells suggest an important role for fishing in the island's economy. Quantities of purple shells suggest this may have been a centre of dye-production. Such shells were also associated with traces of M settlement. The island may well have been a bone of contention between Hierapynda and Itanos. Built water conduits point to water supply problems. Elsewhere remains of a temple were identified, and fragments of its large cult figure. A possible prepalatial M fortification wall was identified. Everything was destroyed at the end of the 4th cent. A.D. (Archaeologia 6 [1983] 58-65). Gaithouronisi (Chrysis). St. Alexiou reports the location in 1975 of building remains associated with prepalatial pottery on the Pelegrina hill (ADelt 30 Chr 34I). WEST CRETE Axos. I. Papapostolou has reported a number of R features identified in 1975 which point to the area that should be identified as the centre of the R city (ADelt 30 Chr 347-8). During I983 the Greek Press reported the discovery of an unpillagcd A cemetery with pithos burials and others in rock hollows; some R tile graves were also discovered (Nea 7.6.83). Pankalochorio (Nome of Rethymno). According to the Greek Press a LM III chamber tomb was discovered containing three larnakes, several painted vases, a stone vase, a bronze mirror and a necklace (Vradyni 20.8.83). Angeliana. The Press reported the discovery in I983 of a LM built tomb with four larnakes and a number of painted vases (Gnonmi 11.6.83). Amariou. According to Kathimerini of 6.9.83 a MM house model and a number of vases were found during excavations here. Chania. I. Papapostolou has reported further excavations in 1975 at the Odos Katre site (AR 1973-74, 40; AR 1975-76, 32). The upper level contained building remains and a paved area, below which were walls and a floor of LM IIIB date. Details of the building associated with the Linear A archive were established (ADelt 30 Chr 347). Also in 1975 a cist tomb was found on Mournion St containing a bronze mirror and cover (ibid.). Chania: Kastelli. Y. Tzedakis and E. Hallager have pub- lished a further interim account of the joint Greek-Swedish excavation (under the direction of Y. Tzedakis) in the LM town at the Plateia Aikaterini site (AR 1980-81, 47) describing work in 1978 and 1979. In the removal of baulks a new LM IIIB hearth was found (Room K). A hand-made black polished bowl with rising handle came from a LM IIIB/C floor in Room D, as well as three sealstones. This building, which went out of use in LM IIIC, had replaced an earlier LM III</page><page sequence="66">68 H. W. CATLING building (with rather smaller rooms), itself partly built on the LM I level. Deep soundings established a sequence of levels (mostly associated with building remains) from LN and EM I through EM II, EM/MM, MM II, MM III to LM I. In the S part of the site further work on the LM I complex confirmed it consists of four different houses and the street system by which they were divided. With the exception of House I, only small parts of the houses have so far been investigated (AAA I5 [1982] 21-30). Work continued in I983; the excavators write:- 'Minor rescue excavations were carried out for ten days. The main results were:- in the LM IB destruction level House I at the site had at least one more room (Q) and that House IV had a staircase leading up to the first floor. Above the destruc- tion level in trench I9 we found further evidence for the LM II and LM IIIAI habitation at the site. From a supposed LM II dump came the most spectacular find of the year, a sealing with an impression depicting a large building complex on a rocky landscape near to the sea and with a male person standing on top of the highest roof. This sealing, however, in all proba- bility originates from the LM IB levels. The same date must' probably also be applied to a roundel (KH Wc 218) (Fig. 130) with a Linear A inscription L 8o, found in a LM IIIAi floor-packing in Trench I9. Further evidence of the LM IIIAI period was found in a well in the N part of the excavated area with a good deposit of pottery. From the LM IIIA/B level was excavated part of a floor deposit where, as well as several complete vases (Fig. 131), was a Linear B inscription (KH Z 22) Fig. I30 Fig. 131 0 1 2 3 4 5 10m .T"a&amp;"T Fig. 132 painted on a stirrup jar (Fig. I32). An interesting arrangement of an oven and hearth next to each other was discovered in the LM IIIC habitation in the N part of the excavated area.' In I982 Y. Tzedakis (AS) resumed investigation at the Mathioudaki Plot (AR 1982-83, 60), in two trenches. In one, remains of four phases came to light, the latest 8th/7th cents B.C., the others LM IIIA and IIIB. In the second (intended to uncover the remainder of the LM I building with polythyron) part of a LM IIIB floor was found; it was further noted that Room Gamma had been designed with polythyra in three of its four sides. There was a stone feature in the room with heavy burning traces, perhaps a hearth. A stone cylinder found nearby may have been connected with it. In the SW corner of the trench, beyond Room Gamma, 20 LM IB cups were found (Ergon I982, 51). Several discoveries made in 1983 were reported by the Greek Press. According to Avgi of I9.4.83, a mosaic floor was found below which were levels containing EM pottery. Akropolis I.I 1.83 describes the excavation of two undisturbed HL built cist tombs in the cemetery of ancient Kydonia. One contained a woman's burial, with clay vases, including a rf lekythos, bronze ornaments and a bronze mirror with bone handle decorated with incised ornament. The second had two burials (one male, one female?), and two female terracotta statuettes (ht. 0.46 m.), clay lamps, gilded bronze ornaments, a bronze mirror and a number of gilded clay objects. Vradyni I2.IO.83 reports another HL cist tomb with male inhumation with gilded bronze myrtle wreath, clay vases and an iron strigil. Ayios Ioannis (Nome of Chania). Eleftheri Gnomi of I4.Io.83 reports the discovery of four HL tombs during building works. Kastelli Kissamou. I. Papapostolou has reported the dis- covery of building remains in 1975 in the Stephanoudaki plot, including mosaic floors decorated with geometric and other designs (ADelt 30 Chr 347). M. Poloyiorghi has published a cist tomb of the 4th cent. B.C. found in I980 near the modern road to Polyrrhenia, containing a woman's skeleton with hair-rings, a pair of silver dress pins linked by a chain, a monochrome pointed amphora, a coarse chytra, a rf pelike (A-biga; B - two youths) (Fig. 133), four small hydriae and 39 squat palmette lekythoi. An AR obol of Polyrrhenia was found in the mouth. The group is datable to the decade 330-20 B.C. (AAA 14 [1981] 162-79). Drapania Kissamou. According to Eleftheri Gnomi of 14.10.83 a M site was discovered in the course of agricultural work. DODECANESE Work of 1975 has been described by Ch. Doumas in ADelt 30 Chr 361-72. A few more recent discoveries have been reported in the Greek Press during 1983 and early I984. For the ancient city of Rhodes see J. Kondis, 'Zum antiken Stadt- bauplan von Rhodos' in AM lxxii (I958) 146-58, particularly for the reference numbers to the ancient street grid. Also note G. Konstantinopoulos in AAA 3 (I970) 55. The cemeteries are explained by P. M. Fraser, Rhodian Funerary Monuments (Oxford 1977) I-8 and plan facing p. I. Rhodes. Akropolis of 28.5.83 reports work on the ancient harbour by the Underwater Ephoria in I983, when part of a</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I983-84 69 Fig. 133 paved wharf or jetty was identified; a stone anchor was found in the same area. Part ofrt ofthertfications were found in building operations in the Vegetable Market in 1983 (Rizospastis 25.8.83), on the Zephyros water-front. The fortifications were again seen in 1975 in a building plot on Gregory V St, where a 15.30 m. stretch was exposed, 3.50 m. wide, three courses preserved, and a buttress/bastion 5.20 X 6.30 m. In the same plot part of the circumferential street P 40 was also exposed (366). Elements of the ancient street irid were identified at several points, frequently in association with remains of buildings that had fronted the streets or the water and drainage systems that served such buildings and had been sited in the make-up of the streets themselves. The account is given in the sequence of street numbers. P Ia was found on Odos Griva (ADelt 30 Chr 366). P 23-1 appeared, associated with two rectangular built wells, in a plot on Odos Kourbouazie (366). P 26 was found again on Odos Kennedy, with an associated built water conduit (369). P 27 was found, together with building remains and part of a mosaic floor on Odos Them. Sophouli (369). P 28 came to light in a plot belonging to the church of Santa Maria. On its W side were remains of part of a building. The street, 5.10 m. wide, had a piped water line for part of its length. Remains were also found of the sub- stantially built bank of the channel linking the city's W harbour with the Mandraki (see Newton, Travlels I, 175 and Hiller von Girtringen, RE Suppl. V 674, I4). Parallel with the wall was a line of 28 pointed amphorae set on end in a sandy deposit the length of the street (a similar find in P 29a was reported AR 1981-82, 59) (366). P 30 was found on Odos Garibaldi with house remains; rooms surrounding an atrium paved with small stones (366). A small section of P 3oa was seen at the junction of K. Palailogou and Garibaldi (366). P 32 was 5.30 m. wide, associated with two square built wells, identified in the Parodos of Odos Ayia Anastasia (366). Eight surfaces of P 32b and a built rectangular well were found in a plot on Odos Solomou (366). A number of public and other buildings were investigated. During the demolition of an old building on Odos Cheimarra (Kyprioti plot) architectural elements and inscribed statue bases were found that had prob- ably originated in the public building earlier found in the adjacent plot. Part of a mosaic floor was also found (369). In a building complex on Odos Amerikis were much-damaged architectural remains associated with a built well and mosaic floors; there was also part of a hypocaust (363). Building remains on Amerikis/25 Martiou included a built cistern and well and mosaic floor. An ash-urn fragment with painted inscription was found in the fill (369). Chance finds from a trench dug the length ofDokous Sokak included wall remains, two altars, fragments of sculpture and AE coins (361). Two metallurgical furnaces were found in the Mylonas plot, Odos Diagoridon, elliptical in plan, one 8.20 X 2.50 m., the other II.45 X 3.30 m. Building remains were found elsewhere in the plot with piped water lines. The area may have been a peribolos (363). A headless statue of a man, a gold ring, a gold bracelet and a pot hoard of gold coins were found in 1983 during building works near the teachers' hostel, according to Greek Press reports (I Rodiaki 4.11.83). A number of finds were made in the ancient cemeteries. Of 13 tombs excavated between Dokous Sokak and the extension of Odos Th. Sophouli, eight were rock-cut and masonry lined, five formed a single group with shared divisions between them. Many unguentaria and two silver plaques were found with the much disturbed burials (361). Twelve tombs found in the extension of Odos Sophouli included two rectangular receptacles, nine rectangular graves with built sides and a plain earth burial. Most had been looted. A cremation in a hydria was found in one of the thekes. Two terracotta figures of women and a group of two cocks were found in a child's grave (361). Nine more graves, including a cremation, were found in the Atsidi plot in the same street. Eight pointed amphoriskoi and two iron strigils were found (36I). 198 graves were found in the same street, on the Diakosavva, Machairaki and Oikonomidi plots. An osteotheke was also found, with a lower deposit of bones and an upper deposit of skulls; three layers, each of some eight rows. Among finds were unguentaria and pointed amphoriskoi, bronze mirrors and iron strigils and knives. A poros stele is in;cribed HPAKAEIAA (363). In the extension to Ayia Maria St a monumental tomb com- plex over 31.50 m. was excavated, the W face incorporating a number of arched entrances to individual tomb chambers which had been constructed within the thickness of the monument (Fig. 134). 25 tombs of differing types were examined. Among finds were bronze mirrors, AR and AE coins, unguentaria, glass and pottery vessels, a small lead coffin, fragments of marble sculpture and inscribed bases (369). Lindos. A. B.

Two LH chamber tombs were found in 1975 on the flank of a very low eminence close to the sea. T.I contained a bronze spearhead, two spatulae and two chisels. The human remains appear to have been burnt. T.2's remains were also burnt; it contained several painted vases (Fig. I35), bronzes (spearhead, fishhook, Fig. I35 chisel, wire) and many lead sinkers. The material is of LH IIIA/B type (372). Kalymnos. According to the Greek Press four LH tombs were found, whose contents included pottery (Eleftheri Ora, 27.1.84). The British School at Athens H. W.
