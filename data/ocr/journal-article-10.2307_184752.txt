<plain_text><page sequence="1">philosophg of Science VOL. 3 January, 1936 NO. i A Metaphysics of Design without Purpose' BY MERRITT HADDEN MOORE HE problem of this paper may be stated simply. ! It is that, in dealing with the nature of reality, it is not only possible, but more fruitful and more accurate, to deal with the category of order ) or design, meaning by this, the structure or rela- { tionship of the parts of a whole, without associa- ting this idea with that of purpose or teleology, than it is to conjoin these concepts. It is the purpose of the paper to show why this separation is advisable, and to indicate the background of the problem which tends to make difficult the separation of these two concepts. I So far as records show, men have had their greatest success in getting hold of what appears to be the nature of the multifarious and variegated phenomena of the universe by imputing to them ordered relationships similar to those through which human ends are achieved. At first this took the form of crude and overt anthropomorphic statement. The difficultiesofthisposition early became apparent, however, and the more progressive, persistent, 'This article is as read before the meeting of the Eastern Division at the American Philosophical Association in New York, December 27, 1934, with the exception of some slight changes of terminology.</page><page sequence="2">2 Design without Purpose and consistent thinkers began to work away from the primitive form of the doctrine. As everyone familiar with the history of thought knows, this has tended to go on, until we have been led to resort to a set, or to sets of depersonalized metaphysical prin- ciples as the basis for our statements about the nature of things. However, one element of the earlier attitude still remains. This is the element of design. This idea is both a natural, and a necessary basis for knowledge. But, in many cases, at least, it is still linked with the idea of teleology, although the latter is no longer anthropomorphically conceived. The basic metaphysical assumption involved in this case is that however impersonal the forces of nature may be, and however natural their manifestations, they are actually working toward ends which are set up, and are finally to be attained, by a being, a force, an essence, or what not, which controls their overt expression. It has long been the opin- ion of many thinkers that this principle is inseparable from that of order or structure. This is the opinion which I wish to challenge. No one interested either in the problem of gaining control over nature, or in that of understanding it, can deny that in some sense or other reality is ordered and related in such ways that reason can deal with it. If desired, this fact may be made the basis of a statement that nature is rational. But care must be exercised in pointing out just what one means by this phrase. It may, and, I think, should, refer simply to the fact that has just been indi- cated-that reality and reason are commensurable, and that it can be significantly said that the latter knows the former. As a matter of fact, the statement in question has more often meant that nature is under the guidance of a rational being or a principle whose processes and purposes we follow as we gain greater under- standing of the processes of nature. Once the fact of knowledge is admitted, the first alternative is not subject to the slightest doubt; on the other hand, the latter seems to be both unnecessary and confusing. With the exception of avowed sceptics, and certain intuitionists and subjectivists, nearly everyone agrees that knowledge is a function of the awareness of order. This order may be regarded,</page><page sequence="3">M. H. Moore 3 as it was by Kant and the critical school, as reflecting a certain nature of the mind in terms of which we must think things. It may be regarded as a function of the nature of the self, as intui- tionists like Bergson, and subjectivists like Mr. George M. Kalif, in his recent article entitled "The Metaphysical Foundation of Induction,2 treat it. According to the latter, inductive discovery of relations is possible because of the persistence of the self. Such views lead to subjectivism or scepticism, for on the basis of them we may say either, that if there is something other than ourselves, we have no knowledge of it, or that nature is contingent upon ourselves. On the other hand, we may take the view that the order which we discover in things really belongs to nature independently of our experience of it. This is not an uncommon position, being, in a certain sense, the point upon which all realists agree. But, the notion of an objective order is often regarded by members of this school as being connected with that of purpose, or rational direction. The French philosopher Cournot is a proponent of this position. If this general position is accepted, the problem of getting through to a reality which "lies behind" a phenomenal appearance falls away. That there are difficulties involved in accepting it, no one can deny-there have been too many out- standing and consistent idealists to make persumptous the claim that idealism is an impossible doctrine. However, both common sense and reason would be gratified if realism could be established upon an adequate basis. Even so, the problem of whether the objective order is also purposive or not would still remain an open question. In the remaining part of this paper I shall indicate the bases for my argument that it is reasonable to believe that the order in nature, which makes knowledge possible, is both objective and independent of the nature of our mind, and also that there is no need for going beyond it to a purpose, or to a designer which explains it. It is perfectly possible to deal with the category of order or 2 Journal of Philosophy. Feb. 15, I934. In opposition to this view it has often been pointed out that the self is the most inconstant element in our experience, and is known only through the persistence of objects.</page><page sequence="4">4 Design without Purpose design without having to come back to the devices of a designing intelligence or to teleology. Before we go farther, it is necessary to state again just what significance the term design has in this connection. As it is used throughout this paper it is analogous with such terms as order, structure, pattern. Some such notion seems to be requisite to all practical and theoretical investigation of nature. Stating it more broadly, it is the notion of a relation of some or all aspects of reality in such a way that the discovery and analysis of one part, leads to the discovery and knowledge of other parts. Put in this way, the extensive limitations of this relationship are left undetermined, for to undertake to define them more specifically would imply that one had evidence as to the relative validity of the alternative metaphysical theories of mon- ism and pluralism. This problem lies outside the province of the present discussion. II Taking the category of design as synonymous with that of order, it must now be shown that it is not subjective, and that it does not involve the notion of teleology. As Cournot puts it, it is almost impossible that our experiences should present them- selves in the broad character of repeated patterns, unless such patterns were objective and independent of our processes of thought. This position cannot be given categorical demonstra- tion, but it is so much more probable than the subjectivistic alter- native, that we have good reason to believe it is true. It is very unlikely that the constancy of ordered relations is due simply to the constancy of our rational processes. Kant's formalism in- evitably continues the eighteenth century tendency to bifurcate nature. The variable a priori presented by Mr. C. I. Lewis,3 is a better suggestion, especially as regards the metaphysical implications of the problem, for, in so far as this variable a priori presents concepts related to the order of things, it represents the 3 Prof. Morris Cohen suggests a similar notion in one of the papers in his recent volume Law and the Social Order, namely, "The Place of Logic in the Law," especially pp. 174ff.</page><page sequence="5">M. H. Moore 5 constant checking of the thought and action of both the race and the individual by an unyielding reality. This process corrects and extends our concepts so that while each age has its uncriti- cized, a priori assumptions, those of any given period are unlike those of the periods which precede it and follow it; but they change on the basis of objective rather than subjective relations. That these relations present themselves in recurrent, identifiable struc- tures is a point in favor of the realistic position. The other extreme-subjectivism-is completely inadequate. In every statement of this position, having reduced the order of nature to a set of mental relations, it is immediately dragged around the house and into the back door, where it now appears as an objective system of relations under some such guise as God, or the constancy of the speed of light. In other words, neither Berkeley nor Eddington and Jeans, can deny the occurrence of experiences having an order the basis of which is objective. Within the limits of a general relativistic philosophy, too, the epistemological problem is that of establishing the correlation between that which is reported in experience and that which is "really there." That is, the whole idea of knowledge as being more than a relationship between concepts-the purely formal notion-implies objectivity. If knowledge and experience in- volve order and design, if they involve a relationship the character of which is relative to both the knower and to the known, then, this order and design must be a part of the relationship. That this cannot arise wholly with the knower, isshown in the criticism of idealism. It might be possible in an absolute knower, but a doctrine requiring such a reality raises more questions than it can settle. It complicates rather than simplifies our problem, and on that basis alone may be seriously questioned. Thus it is reasonable to believe that order or design in nature is objective, and the burden of proof rests upon those who challenge, rather than upon those who defend this metaphysical premise. Its defense rests admittedly upon arguments of probability, but a probability so well attested that we have reason to believe that it is true.</page><page sequence="6">6 Design without Purpose III But this simply poses rather than answers the problem of teleology. Granted that the pattern of experience is the true reporting of patterns in objective nature, how does the order thus revealed arise? It must come either from some source external to itself-the extranaturalistic argument-or from tendencies which are a part of the same nature of things which the forms reveal-the naturalistic argument. The difficulty with the for- mer is that it must explain the nature of that which is inexplicable. The moment any sort of an extranaturalistic thesis is set up, it is presupposed that an extranatural reality exists. Its function is to produce, to arrange, or to dispose the aspects of reality which we regard as natural. But on what possible basis can such reality be known? It must remain a gratuitous assumption, for, by definition, it is such, that acquaintance with it is impossible. The first difficulty of extranaturalism, then, is that of giving it significant meaning as related to reality. But grant that this can be done, the further presumption is that we can understand the way in which the extranatural acts upon the natural. Now this is unreasonable, for the necessity of setting up the extranat- ural is to explain those things for which our knowledge of nature cannot account. This means that the former must be essentially unlike the latter. In this case, we have no knowledge of how the natural order is affected by the extranatural, and no evidence that the natural order is a consequent of extranatural deter- minants. As far as knowledge is concerned, the only things that can affect natural reality are natural processes. We cannot imagine any relation between the natural and the extranatural. The problem of design is in no wise simplified by appealing to the idea of a designer outside of the system. Such an appeal simply moves the problem back one step, for either the designer designs by nature, to use an Aristotelian phrase, or designs because of some still further removed insistence for design. If the former alternative is taken, it is just as reasonable to say that the natural order is the condition of its own design. If the other alternative is taken, one is involved in an infinite regress, and the problem</page><page sequence="7">M. H. Moore 7 still awaits to engulf us; we have been granted only a temporary stay of execution. In further objection, it may be pointed out that the area of the known is being constantly extended. What is extranatural to one age, is natural to another. Since incursions into the extra- natural continuously reveal material amenable to natural state- ment, it would seem to indicate that what is still styled extra- natural, may, with increased knowledge, be seen to be like that which we have already come to regard as natural. What this amounts to is simply to repeat once more that an appeal to igno- rance proves nothing. The naturalistic statement avoids all these difficulties because it has no need of the entities and processes which they imply. In the first place, it accepts the structure of things as due to the nature of the things themselves in the ordered relationship. It has no need to correct its inadequacy by a greater one. This is not to say that naturalism does not recognize limitations in our ex- perience and knowledge. It does. But in so doing it rests on the probable belief that if what is now unknown, later becomes known, it can be dealt with in natural categories. In the second place, this position needs no outside agent to account for the fact of structure and design in the order of reality as known. An exami- nation of a few instances of design in nature is enough to reveal the basis upon which this argument rests. It is well known that any system of bodies tends to maintain its structure because of the mutual interaction of the movements and the directions of the elements composing it. This is true of the heavenly system; of a snow-flake; of ecological balance; and of social structures. In each case, the order or design of the sys- tem arises from its internal nature and relations, and not from external compulsion. It is natural that we should marvel at the neatness with which one form dovetails into the nature and needs of another; how a change in one part produces a compensating change in other parts. But in any system having design or order, this may be more reasonably dealt with in terms of the system itself than laid to the account of some agent external to it. Thus it is indicated that while order, or design, is an important</page><page sequence="8">8 Design without Purpose element in the scheme of things; and may even be the basic cate- gory of a metaphysics which is both realistic-in the sense that the order of nature is objective-and rationalistic-in the sense that the genius of the mind is such that it is responsive to this objective order in things-it is not necessary to regard reality with its order and structure as being the result of a teleological propulsion which lies outside of it, either as a designing agent, or as an impersonal, but actuating force or principle. What order or design is found, may best be dealt with as a function of the system itself, taken as a whole; as expressing the balance of form which results from the mutual interaction of the elements which compose it. This view not only appears to be as able-indeed it seems to be more able-to deal adequately with the problems of metaphysics, but it has the additional advantage of being the simplest approach to this insistent problem-since it avoids the complicating consequences of predicating things of the unknown. As between opposing theories, each of which accounts for the relevant data, it has long been recognized that the simpler is more probably true.4 Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois. 4 wish to make clear at this point that I am not shutting my eyes to the fact of pur- pose in human affairs. Certainly a good deal of the behavior of human beings, to say nothing of other biological forms, is directed toward ends and is therefore-by definition- purposive. This is sufficiently taken into account, however, when one realizes that this purposiveness is itself a function of the total situation in which the organism and its ends are found. The fact that we purpose one thing rather than another reflects the social structure in which we find ourselves. The fact that we are able to propose ends, and to attain some of them depends upon the organic structure which we bring to the situation. Again we are dealing with a situation in which the various factors are functionally related and require no "extras" from without the system to enable us to account for the changing pattern of the structure. The point for which I am contending is that purpose is not only unnecessary but also leads to unfruitful complications when used as a metaphysical category.</page></plain_text>
