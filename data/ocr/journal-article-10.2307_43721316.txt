MENKEN Katholieke Theologische Universiteit 3584 CS Utrecht The Netherlands I. Introduction The fourth evangelist relates that Jesus' side was pierced, immediately after his death, by a Roman soldier (John 19:34). He connects this incident with the word of the prophet Zechariah: "They shall look on him whom they have pierced" (Zech 12:10; John 19:37). This quotation confronts the exegete with two problems: (1) The textual form of the quotation is peculiar. It deviates strongly from the LXX; it has affinities with the Hebrew text and with the later Greek translations of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, but without agreeing exactly with any one of them. The quotations from the same passage in Zechariah, or allusions to it, found elsewhere in early Christian literature, closely agree in textual form with John 19:37b. How is the textual form of the quotation in John to be explained? (2) The meaning of the quotation in its Johannine context is far from certain. We can observe that the "piercing" from the prophecy has been fulfilled, in agreement with the formula which introduces the quotation in John 19:36, but what about the "looking"? In John, who are those who "shall look on him"? Are they the same as those who pierced him? When and how does this looking on him occur, and how exactly is Jesus its object? 494</page><page sequence="2">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 495 These problems have already been discussed by biblical scholars, of course, but the results are quite divergent.1 I hope to throw some new light on the textual form of the quotation by taking into account the various textual forms of Zech 12: 10aß which are known, and by tracing their development. The meaning of the quotation is usually established on the basis of its immediate and broader Johannine context; I intend to demonstrate here that this approach should be carried out consistently and that it should be comple- mented by considerations of a traditio-historical kind.2 II. Textual Form In assessing the form of the quotation in John 19:37, we should first observe that there is remarkable textual constancy in the quotations from Zech 12:10aß or allusions to it in early Christian literature. The explicit quotation in John 19:37 reads: ovj/ovxai eiç öv è£eK6vrr|aav, "they shall look on him whom they have pierced." In Rev 1:7, after an allusion to Dan 7:13 ("Behold, he is coming with the clouds"), we meet a clear allusion to Zech 12: 10aß: Kai ö'|/exai3 auxòv rcãç ò(p0aX^iòç Kai oïtiveç aôxòv è^EKévxT1- aav, "and every eye will see him, also those who pierced him"; the sequel, "and all tribes of the earth will lament on account of him," alludes to Zech 12:10b-14. The future oiļ/siai or oyovxai and the aorist ē^EKeviTļoav are found in both John 19:37 and Rev 1:7. An allusion is also found in Matt 24:30: "And then all tribes of the earth will lament and they will see (ovļ/oviai) the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven"; again, we observe that Zech 12:10-14, where the looking on the pierced one is followed by the lament of all tribes, and Dan 7:13 are combined. The parallel text in Mark 13:26 (cf. Luke 21:27) has merely: "And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds." The starting point for Matthew's insertion of the 1 See the survey in A. T. Hanson, The Prophetic Gospel: A Study of John and the Old Testament (Edinburgh: Clark, 1991) 223-24. 2 See my earlier studies on OT quotations in John, "The Quotation from Isa 40,3 in John 1,23," Bib 66 (1985) 190-205; "The Provenance and Meaning of the Old Testament Quotation in John 6:31," NovT 30 (1988) 39-56; "The Old Testament Quotation in John 6,45: Source and Redaction," ETL 64 (1988) 164-72; "Die Form des Zitates aus Jes 6,10 in Joh 12,40: Ein Beitrag zum Schriftgebrauch des vierten Evangelisten," BZ ns 32 (1988) 189-209; "Die Redaktion des Zitates aus Sach 9,9 in Joh 12,15," ZNW 80 (1989) 193-209; "The Translation of Psalm 41.10 in John 13.18," JSNT 40 (1990) 61-79; "The Old Testament Quotation in John 19,36: Sources, Redaction, Background," The Four Gospels, 1992 (Festschrift F.

On the other hand, it is clumsy Greek (a plural predicate followed by a singular subject), and that might be an argument for its originality.</page><page sequence="3">496 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 lament of all tribes can only have been Mark's öyovxai; this verb form reminded the First Evangelist of Zech 12:10, which, in the version known to him, apparently contained oyovxai.4 Quotations from Zech 12: 10(-14) or allusions to it are also found in early Christian literature outside the NT, always in an eschatological interpretation of this OT passage,5 just as in Rev 1:7 and in Matt 24:30. In Barn. 7:9, it is said that those who crucified Jesus oyovxai aùxòv xóxe xfj r^epą, "will see him then on that day," and that they will ask themselves: "Is he not the one we once crucified after having mocked and pierced (KaxaKsvxf|aavxeç) and spat upon him?" The allusion to Zech 12:10 is clear. Again, ovj/ovxai is used; this time the piercing is indicated not with ekkevxeiv but with the cognate verb KdxaKEVxsïv (cf. Jer 28[51]:4 LXX). In the writings of Justin Martyr, Zech 12:10 is used several times. Justin Apol. 1.52.10-12 is a mixture of prophetic texts which Justin ascribes to Zechariah (from whom indeed most of them derive); according to Justin, they contain the reaction of the Jews to Christ's coming in glory. Part of the series is Zech 12:10,12 from which Justin mentions the lament of the tribes and then, in literal agreement with the Fourth Evangelist, quotes the words which are also quoted in John 19:37: Kaì xóxe öyovxai się öv è£eKévxT|aav, "and then they shall look on him whom they have pierced" {Apol. 1.52.12). In Dial. 14.8, where Justin deals with Christ's second parousia, he first refers to Dan 7:13, and then to Zech 12:10: Kai övj/sxai ó X,aòç ó^uùv Kai yvcopisï się öv è^8K8vxT1oav, "and your people shall see and shall know him whom they have pierced."6 This reference agrees in textual form with the quotations in John 19:37 and in Justin Apol. 1 .52. 12, except for the singular öysxai caused by the subject ó A.aòç ô^uùv; in spite of the insertion of Kai yvcopieï, Justin retains the preposition się of his Zecharian text, which results in the odd construction yvcopiÇeiv eîç. Something similar happens in Dial. 32.2, where Justin distinguishes between the two parousiai of Christ: a first one when "he was pierced" (ē£eKsvxf|0Tļ) by Trypho's fellow Jews, and a second one öxe è7uiyvóa£a08 eîç öv è£eKevxf|oaxe, "when you will recognize him whom you have pierced," and when the tribes will lament. The allusion is evident, 4 So also B. Lindars, New Testament Apologetic: The Doctrinal Significance of the Old Testament Quotations (London: SCM, 1961) 124. N. Perrin ("Mark xiv. 62: The End Product of a Christian Pesher Tradition?" NTS 12 [1965-66] 150-55) discerns an allusion to Zech 12:10 in övj/eaöe in Mark 14:62 and ö'|/ovxai in Mark 13:26; however, the use of this verb, which is easily explained in another way (see below), seems, when taken alone, to be too narrow a basis for supposing influence of Zech 12:10. Matthew's reading of Mark 13:26 does not necessarily coincide with Mark's intentions. 5 I use the terms "eschatology" and "eschatological" in the sense of future eschatology, unless I expressly indicate otherwise. 6 Justin erroneously ascribes to Hosea the words from Zechariah.</page><page sequence="4">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 497 because Justin retains the preposition cię, although he changes the preceding verb into ¿TuvyvcbaeaBe, creating again peculiar Greek.7 Further confirmation of the presence of the verbs ópãv (in the future) and èKKsvieïv (in the aorist) in Justin's text of Zech 12:10 is found in Dial. 64.7, where he speaks of the returning Christ öv ópãv ^léMouai Kai kótutectOcu oi èKKsvxf|aavT6ç aòxóv, "whom those who have pierced him will see and lament," and in Dial. 1 18.1, about the day of judgment, "on which all those from your tribes who have pierced (èKK8vxf|aavxsç) this Christ will lament."8 From this survey of relevant passages it becomes clear that the part of Zech 12: 10 quoted in John 19:37 is cited in Justin Apol. 1 .52. 12 in exactly the same textual form, and - taking into account the relative degree of freedom an author has in casually referring or alluding to an OT passage - that the numerous other uses of this text in early Christian literature are based on the same textual form. The standard early Christian version of Zech 12: 10aß was: ovļ/ovTdi eiç öv è^8KévTT1aav;9 as will appear below, this version differs from the other known versions of the same passage. How is this constancy of textual form to be explained? There is, in my view, no convincing reason to suppose that any of the authors of the writings mentioned above influenced any of the others in the use of Zech 12:10. That John depends on Matthew is not very probable, and the Book of Revelation is independent of both gospels. The Epistle of Barnabas does not clearly show dependence upon Matthew, John, or the Apocalypse. Justin Martyr knows the Apocalypse {Dial. 81.4), probably Matthew and John as well, and maybe also Barnabas, but his use of Zech 12:10 shows no clear traces of literary dependence on one of the earlier quotations or allusions. Unlike John, he connects looking on the pierced one with Christ's second coming. Unlike the Apocalypse and Matthew, he always makes Jews alone those who look. The literary context of his uses of Zech 12: 10 is quite different from what we find in the NT writings. There is at most in Justin's writings, the Epistle of Barnabas , Matthew, and Revelation a common eschatological outlook in which Zech 12: 10-14 is applied to the "second parousia " of Christ (to borrow 7 According to A. Rahlfs ("Über Theodotion-Lesarten im Neuen Testament und Aquila- Lesarten bei Justin," ZNW 20 [1921] 182-99, esp. p. 185) and W. Bauer ( Das Johannesevan- gelium [HNT 6; 3d ed.; Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1933] 227), elç in Dial. 14.8; 32.2 belongs with è^EKévxr|aav ("they will know/ recognize the one in whom they stabbed"), but both schol- ars also remark that ¿kkevteīv, "to pierce," should be connected with an accusative. To my mind, elç belongs with yvopiet and èiciyvtûGECJÔE, as these verb forms serve as a supplement to ö'1/ECJ0ai or a substitute for it. On both suppositions Justin writes incorrect Greek. 8 See Dial. 121.2 for another quotation from Zech 12:10-14, which does not contain 12:10a. 9 The early Christian textual form of the sequel is less constant; KÓyovxai, "they will lament," and the substantive cpuA.f|, "tribe," always figure in it.</page><page sequence="5">498 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 Justin's terminology), and in which the combination with Dan 7:13 is more or less usual. Even if Justin, in his use of Zech 12: 10, depends on the NT texts, we still have the evidence of John, the Book of Revelation, and Matthew - all three independent of each other. So it seems best to suppose that Zech 12: 10-14, and especially 12:10aß, was in use in early Christian circles as a testimo- nium ,10 primarily concerning Christ's final coming, and that the textual form of the quotation in John 19:37 is, in fact, the form in which the text was current in early Christianity.11 The question is then how this textual form relates to the other known textual forms of the same passage. The MT has: Tipvntfx nx *Vx ltram, which can be translated as: "And they shall look on me, whom they have pierced." This Hebrew clause contains several grammatical obscurities: (1) The word vocalized in the MT as ^x, "on me," can also be vocalized as a poetic form of the preposition Vx which occurs in Job 3:22; 5:26; 15:22; 29:19. This vocalization would lead to the translation: "They shall look on whom they have pierced." (2) The particle nx can be considered as the nota accusativi or as the preposition "with." The latter interpretation, of course, is incompatible with the alternative vocalization discussed under (1). (3) When nx is read as the nota accusativi , there are still two possibilities: it can have that function either within the main clause or within the subor- dinate relative clause. With the first possibility, the main clause has a double object: one introduced by a preposition, and one introduced by the nota accusativi. The second possibility results in an instance where "by a kind of anticipation, itfx is preceded by nx of the accusative or by the preposition 10 My use of the term testimonium does not imply the hypothesis of a written collection of testimonies. The entire complex which is Zechariah 9-14 was in high esteem in early Chris- tianity: see C. H. Dodd, According to the Scriptures: The Sub-Structure of New Testament Theology (London: Nisbet, 1952) 64-67; Lindars, NT Apologetic, 110-34. 11 Roughly the same conclusion can be found in Dodd, According to the Scriptures, 65; Lindars, NT Apologetic, 122-27 (he rightly remarks about Justin's use of the passage: "If Justin derived his text from the NT, then it is an amalgam of all three passages, Matt. 24.30, John 19.37, and Rev. 1 .7.

In the latter case we should translate: "on me whom they have pierced." These grammatical obscurities imply exegetical problems. The person speaking in Zech 12:1-10 is the Lord, and he is the referent of the suffix of in its masoretic vocalization. Zech 12: 10b-14 is about the mourning of Jerusalem and of the land for the pierced one. When one follows the masoretic vocalization and considers nK as the nota accusativi , one is almost forced to identify God and the pierced one, which creates the problem of a very strong anthropomorphism: how can God be pierced? Reading Zech 12: 10aß from the perspective of the preceding verses suggests that "the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . . . shall look on me" means that they will look on the Lord, whereas the connection with what follows obliges the reader to consider the pierced one as a human being, distinct from God. The MT of Zech 12:10aß is obviously a very difficult text. It is possible that it arose out of a contamination of two textual forms, with two different constructions of the hiphil of una: nmm, "and they shall look on me," as a conclusion to what precedes, and Tip-nuta nx uram, "and they shall look at whom they have pierced," as the beginning of what follows.13 It is not surprising that various exegetical solutions have been proposed for making sense of the MT.14 In what follows, I shall show that the ancient translations of the Hebrew text can be explained on the basis of the lectio difficilior which we now find in the MT and which was apparently the reading of the Hebrew of Zech 12:10aß when the LXX translation was made; there is no need to suppose that other Hebrew readings were translated.15 The LXX reads: Kaì è7iipX.é'|/ovxai rcpóç àv0' d&gt;v Kaicùp/riaavio, "and they shall look on me because they have danced" - a translation which avoids the problem of the anthropomorphism. The translator read vipi, "they have pierced," as np-i, "they have danced" (with the connotation of dancing insultingly), probably not because his Hebrew text contained this word, but because he himself transposed the letters i and i, which are quite similar. Both letter transposition and the interchange of similar consonants were accepted 12 P. Joiion and T. Muraoka, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew (Subsidia Biblica 14; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1991) §158m, where more examples are given. One would expect: tik n¡rr -itfx (or mx, when is vocalized differently). 13 So M. Saebo, Sacharja 9-14: Untersuchungen von Text und Form (WMANT 34; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1969) 100. For the various possibilities see P. Lamarche, Zacharie IX -XIV: Structure littéraire et messianisme (EBib; Paris: Gabalda, 1961) 80-84; Saebo, Sacharja 9-14, 97-102. A similar evaluation of the reading of the MT is given by M. Delcor, "Un problème de critique textuelle et d'exégèse: Zach., xii, 10: Et aspicient ad me quem confixerunt," RB 58 (1951) 189-99, esp. pp. 192-96; Lamarche, Zacharie IX-XIV, 82; Sacbe, Sacharja 9-14, 99-101, and others.</page><page sequence="7">500 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 exegetical devices in early Judaism,16 and, apart from the LXX, there is no evidence for the reading npl. The best explanation for the LXX's àv0' óv, "be- cause," is, as far as I see, that the translator considered his Hebrew npv-itfx nx as an accusativus limit ationis:17 "they shall look on me concerning the fact that they danced," which is tantamount to "because they danced."18 So there is no need to suppose that the LXX translator translated a Hebrew text which differed from the MT.19 In the later Greek translations, the problem of the Hebrew text is solved in a less radical way. Aquila translated npvitíx nx with gov &lt;L ¿£skśvtt1CT(xv, "with the one whom they have pierced." He considered nx as a preposition (he used aov with the dative, not with the accusative),20 and in that way, so far as we can judge from this fragment, solved the problem of the apparent identity of God and the pierced one. Of Symmachus' translation, only the words s^iTupoaOsv sne^eics vxTļaav have been preserved. The latter word 16 For letter transposition, see, e.g., Ps 48[49]: 12 LXX, where oaip, "their inside," has been read by the translator as map, "their grave" = oí látpoi auxcov, a transposition also found in b. Moced Qat. 9b (see L. Prijs, Jüdische Tradition in der Septuaginta [Leiden: Brill, 1948; re- printed, Hildesheim: Olms, 1987] 35-45), or Gen 30:30 LXX, where 'rvaV, "for my house," was read as rra '■?, "for me a house" = ènauiô) oIkov; see also Schnackenburg, "Schriftzitat," 241 . For the interchange of i and i, see, e.g., Hos 10:7 LXX, where the stem nm, "to be silent," has been read as noi, "to throw" = à7EÉppi'1/ev, or Jonah 1:9 LXX, where the translator read nay, "a Hebrew," as *• ia», "a servant of the Lord" = SoCXoç Kupíou. For numerous further examples see J. F. Schleusner, Novus thesaurus philologico-criticus . . . (London: Duncan, 1 829), and J. Lust, E. Eynikel, and K. Hauspie, with the collaboration of G. Chamberlain, A Greek-English Lexi- con of the Septuagint. Part 1, A-I (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1992). See Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, §126g. A. S. van der Woude (Zacharia [De Predi- king van het Oude Testament; Nijkerk: Callenbach, 1984] 235-36) solves the problem of the MT by supposing this construction, which results in the translation: "They shall look on me [God] on account of the one whom they have pierced." 18 In the LXX, àvô' (bv is used as a translation for a range of causal conjunctions, such as pr, inte jy», "itíirnnn, itfx-V», and simple ntíx. 19 The variants of the LXX text in which the words elç öv è^EKévrriaav are substituted for ávô' (bv KaTû)pxr|cravTO (so the Lucianic recension) or are added to this phrase, are either corrections made on the basis of Theodotion's version (see below) or adaptations to the early Christian version found in John 19:37. See A. Deissmann, Veröffentlichungen aus der Heidel- berger Papyrus- Sammlung, 1 (Heidelberg: Winter, 1905) 66-71, and the apparatus in J. Ziegler's edition in the Göttingen LXX. According to Deissmann, the reading npi, presupposed as the reading behind the LXX, is the original Hebrew text which was changed in the pre-Christian period into vi¡n "im messianischen Interesse" (p. 69, with a reference, p. 66 n. 4, to A. Merx, Die vier kanonischen Evangelien nach ihrem ältesten bekannten Texte, 2/ 1 [Berlin: Reimer, 1902] 348-52); both Hebrew texts were then translated into Greek. Unfortunately, Deissmann and Merx do not make clear what kind of messianism this may have been; in fact, the supposed secondary reading created problems instead of solving them. A flaw of Deissmann's view is that he considers the variant readings only of the verbs in Zech 1 2: 1 Oaß, not those of the words between the verbs. 20 Overlooked, it seems, by Saebo, Sacharja 9-14, 99.</page><page sequence="8">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 501 agrees with Aquila, Theodotion (see below), and the early Christian trans- lation (see above), except for the double preposition. The former word could correspond to the targum's paraphrase, in which is rendered p, "before me,"21 but it is difficult to make definite sense of it. Theodotion's translation is known in two slightly different forms: (a) Kai ¿7iißX,e'|/ovxai 7upóç ne ôv è^EicévTTiaav, "and they shall look on me whom they have pierced" (so mš 86); (b) Kai ¿7iißX.e'|/ovxai npóç 'ie eiç öv è^EKévxr|aav, "and they shall look on me, to whom they have pierced" (so the Syro-Hexapla). Whichever of these two may be Theodotion's original translation,22 both forms presup- pose a text and vocalization like those of the MT. Theodotion read nx as the nota accusativi , in form (a) in the relative clause, in form (b) in the main clause. In the latter case, a second preposition (eîç) becomes necessary to introduce the second object.23 In both forms the problem of the anthropo- morphism remains. Form (b) of Theodotion's translation agrees with the Peshitta ( wnhwrwn Iwty bmn ddqrw), and form (a) with the Vg {et aspicient ad me quem con - fixerunt). The paraphrase in the targum is peculiar: iVüVüni V» p "and they shall pray before me for those who were exiled."24 "Looking" is interpreted as "praying," and "piercing" as "exiling."25 The paraphrase pre- supposes a Hebrew text and a vocalization like those of the MT, and m seems to have been read as the nota accusativi in the main clause. However, in the case of this targumic paraphrase, in which the problem of the anthropo- morphism has been settled drastically, we can hardly speak of a translation. We now turn to the early Christian version of Zech 12: 10aß as it is found in John 19:37. It starts with öyovxai, while all other known Greek versions have è7ûipXé'|/ovxai. The latter translation is certainly more to the point: ópãv, "to see," is a somewhat weak translation of the hiphil of tana, "to look." It is not, however, an impossible translation; one finds it for the hiphil of oaa in Symmachus' translation of 1 Sam 2:32, and one finds the aorist iSstv in the same function in the LXX of Num 12:8; Job 6: 19; Isa 38: 1 1 . The construction of ópãv with się in our passage (caused here by the Hebrew original) is somewhat unusual but not impossible; it is found in Greek literature since Homer (see, e.g., Homer OúÍ. 20.373; Sophocles El. 925).26 The choice of 21 Saeb0, Sacharja 9-14, 101 n. 1. Rahlfs ("Theodotion-Lesarten," 184) prefers reading (a). 23 The preposition elç does not belong with èÇeKévrnaav; see n. 7 above. 24 This seems the most obvious translation; see further Str-B 2. 583-84. 25 See T. Jansma, Inquiry into the Hebrew Text and the Ancient Versions of Zechariah IX-XIV (OTS 7; Leiden: Brill, 1949) 1 17. Jansma points out that also in the Targum of Isa 8:22 the hiphil of öaa is rendered by kpd, and he labels the rendering iVöVüxt V» a "solecism." 26 See LS J, s.v. ópáco i.l; Bauer, Johannesevangelium, 227.</page><page sequence="9">502 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 oij/ovxai might be explained as the result of a wish to create a wordplay with KÓv|/o vxai at the beginning of Zech 1 2: 1 Ob,27 but another motive for the choice seems more important. We have already observed that the predominant interpretation of our passage in early Christianity is an eschatological one: at the parousia people will look on the pierced Christ. Now in early Christian literature the verb ópãv (with the aorist iSsîv) is often used of witnessing Christ's parousia , or God, or the kingdom, at the eschaton.28 This verb, not ¿7üißX.87U8iv which is found in the other Greek versions of Zech 12:10, sug- gested itself for the translation of Zech 12:10 as applied to the parousia of Christ because it was already in use in connection with the parousia. Another peculiarity of the early Christian version of Zech 12:10aß is the absence of the 1st pers. sg. found in It can be explained simply by a different vocalization of the Hebrew: the word has been read, in the manner of a pesher, as the poetic form of the preposition Vx, and then translated as się. When this was done, nx had to be interpreted, of course, as an anticipating nota accusativi having its function within the relative clause. It is not strange that the 1st pers. sg. is eliminated in the early Christian version. As we observed above, Zech 12:10aß in early Christian literature is often read in connection with what follows in vv 10b- 14, the lament of the tribes for the pierced one,29 and this person is there referred to in the 3d pers. and is not considered as identical with God. In early Christianity, the text is applied not to God but to the crucified Christ who will come at the eschaton. It is not necessary at this point to hypothesize an otherwise unknown version of the Hebrew consonantal text which would be the basis of the early Chris- tian version of Zech 12:10aß;30 a different vocalization of the known conso- nantal text is a sufficient explanation. Nor is it necessary to suppose that the 27 So Perrin, "Mark xiv.62," 153; Schnackenburg, "Schriftzitat," 243. Freed (OT Quo- tations, 115) thinks that "[John's] öyovxai may be a misreading of the LXX's kó'j/ovt(xi" that is frequently included in quotations in early Christian writers. However, in several of the early Christian uses of Zech 12:10 both oyovxai and KÓyoviai are found, so that a wordplay seems more probable. 28 See Mark 9:1 parr.; 13:26 parr.; 14:62 par.; Matt 5:8; Luke 3:6 (= Isa 40:5); 13:28; 17:22; Heb 9:28; 12:14; 1 John 3:2; Rev 22:4; also examples in the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, e.g., Did. 16:8; 2 Clem. 17:5; Herm. 92:3 (Sim. 9.15). This way of speaking may have been inspired by OT texts such as Isa 33:17; 35:2; 40:5; 52:8,10. See W. Michaelis, "ópáů), ktX.," TWNT 5. 315-81, esp. pp. 361-62, 368; J. Kremer, "ópáa), ktX.," EWNT 2. 1287-93, esp. col. 1290. Perrin's explanation of this vocabulary via a pesher tradition concerning Zech 12:10-14 and Dan 7:13 ("Mark xiv.62," 153) is too narrow; see also Schnackenburg, "Schriftzitat," 244. 29 This passage sometimes even precedes v 10aß, see Matt 24:30; Justin, Apol. 1.52.1 1-12. Heb 10:29 possibly contains an allusion to Zech 12:10aa. 30 So C. C.

As for the theory that the Fourth Evangelist did not want to give an exact quotation,33 it can only be an ultima ratio when no better explanation can be found. The relative clause npvitíK is rendered in the early Christian version with öv è^EKé VTTļ octy, exactly as in Theodotion's translation. Aquila has the same verb, Symmachus a cognate one. Tìkkevteìv is a natural equivalent of ipi, used by the LXX to translate this Hebrew verb in Judg 9:54; 1 Chr 10:4; Jer 44[37]:10; Lam 4:9; and by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus in Isa 13:15; Zech 13:3 ( conßgent , according to Jerome). Other compounds of K6VT8ÏV are also used to translate the same Hebrew verb: ötiokevtew in Num 25:8 and 1 Sam 31:4 (bis) LXX, KaxaKevxeiv in Jer 28[51]:4 LXX.34 So the choice of ćkkevteiv in the early Christian version was quite an obvious one, and there is no need to postulate dependence here upon a proto- Theodotionic version; we already observed, moreover, that in the rest of the quotation the early Christian version and that of Theodotion widely diverge.35 It is of course possible to broaden the postulate of dependence upon a proto-Theodotionic version to arrive at the hypothesis of an early Christian text of Zech 12: 10aß dependent on a revised version of the LXX.36 But why 31 So C.

And why should the 1st pers. sg. have been omitted in such a revision, intended to make the LXX agree better with the Hebrew? On the other hand, these features of the early Christian version are called for when the text is read as a testimonium concerning the parousia of the crucified Christ, especially as "I" refers to God and v 10aß is read in connection with what follows. Our conclusion has to be that the early Christian textual form of Zech 12: 10aß is an independent Greek translation of the Hebrew. The use of Zech 12: 10aß (and following verses) as a testimonium probably started rather early: the passage is used in the mutually independent writings Matthew, John, and Revelation, and its christological potential, which could be inter- esting at a later phase of theological reflection (with the identification of Christ and God, and the application of the qualifications "only one" and "firstborn" of v 10b to Christ), is not yet exploited. This last observation also makes it improbable that the Fourth Evan- gelist himself translated the text from the Hebrew.37 Had he done so, he would not have had reason to leave out the 1st pers. sg. (cf. the quotations in John 2:17; 12:38,40; 13:18; 15:25; 19:24). The evangelist apparently knew and used Zech 12:10aß in the form of the fixed early Christian testimonium .38 III. Meaning The issue to be discussed in this section is the meaning of the quotation in its Johannine context.39 A first question to be answered here is whether those who look and those who pierce are necessarily the same. In the original text of Zechariah, they seem to be identical. It was quite possible in Jewish and early Christian exegesis, however, that the obvious but not explicitly indicated subject of a verb form was replaced by another subject in the (AB 29 A; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1970) 938. B. G. Schuchard ( Scripture within Scripture Ē- The Interrelationship of Form and Function in the Explicit Old Testament Citations in the Gospel of John [SBLDS 133; Atlanta: Scholars, 1992] 141-49) leaves open the possibilities of an Ur-Theodotion or a corrected LXX. 37 As is supposed by Burney, Lagrange, Torrey and Heer (see nn. 30 and 31) and by Humann, "Function," 40-42; it is also considered as a possibility by Freed, OT Quotations, 1 14; De Ru, "Zij zullen zien," 198; Schnackenburg, "Schriftzitat," 241. 38 See the literature mentioned above in n. 11; also Rahlfs, "Theodotion-Lesarten," 190. 39 It is quite possible that the quotation from Zech 12:10, together with the preceding narrative (John 19:31-34) and the OT quotation in v 36, comes from pre-Johannine tradition; the question to be discussed here, however, is what meaning it has in the final redaction of the evangelist, who gave the quotation its present position and function. See Menken, "John 19,36," section III.</page><page sequence="12">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 505 explanation of the biblical text. We have an example in John 6:31, where Moses, not God, is supposed to be the subject of Ps 78[77]:24b and thus the giver of the manna (see the correction in 6:32); there are other examples of this exegetical device.40 Still more important is the fact that in Jewish and early Christian exegesis of Zech 12:10 outside John 19:37 it is often presup- posed that the subjects of the two verb forms in Zech 12:10aß are not iden- tical. In Rev 1:7 and Matt 24:30, "every eye" and "all the tribes of the earth" are those who see and mourn; that implies that the subject of "looking" encompasses many more people than the subject of "piercing." In 6. Sukk. 52a, we find a discussion of the object of the mourning in Zech 12:10. One possibility put forward there is that the lament concerns the Messiah ben Joseph, and this interpretation is supported by a quotation from Zech 12:10aß- ba. Here, the subject who looks and mourns is evidently Israel, but the subject who pierces is different: the killing of the Messiah ben Joseph is ascribed in Jewish tradition to Israel's enemies.41 In the paraphrase in the targum quoted above a distinction also seems to exist between the subjects of the two verbs. So it is not necessary for the subjects of the two verbs in John 19:37b to be identical.42 While it is evident that the Roman soldiers and "the Jews" who indirectly instigate their act are the subject of èÇeKévxT]aav, the subject of o'|/ovT&lt;xi is not immediately clear. If the evangelist is merely interested in the fulfilment of the words from Zech 12: 10 in the preceding narrative, the Roman soldiers with "the Jews," and the eyewitness mentioned in 19:35, are the only possible candidates. So far as the former are concerned the problem is that a look - repentant or not - towards Jesus on the part of the soldiers or "the Jews" after the piercing43 is not mentioned in John's text.44 The eyewitness 40 See Menken, "John 6:31"; other examples there, pp. 55-56. 41 See Str-B 2. 297-99; W. Bousset, Die Religion des Judentums im späthellenistischen Zeitalter (HNT 21; 3d ed. [H. Gressmann]; Tübingen: Mohr, 1926) 230. According to R. J. Wyatt ("Jewish Exegesis and the Gospel of John" [diss., University of Wales, 1983] 208, referred to by Wilcox, "Text Form," 202), the same haggadic exposition as in b. Sukk. 52a appears in more detailed form in a fragment of Targum YeruSalmi found as a marginal gloss in Codex Reuchlinianus; there, the Messiah ben Joseph is killed by Gog. 42 The recourse to an impersonal character of the two 3d pers. pl. verb forms, in order to make it possible that their subjects are not the same (so, e.g., W. Thiising, Die Erhöhung und Verherrlichung Jesu im Johannesevangelium [NTAbh 21/1-2; 3d ed.; Münster: Aschendorff, 1979] 20 n. 35), is unnecessary. 43 The difference in tense between the future öyoviai and the aorist indicative èÇeicév- Ttļoav requires that the piercing of Jesus' side precedes the looking on him. This is too easily overlooked by A. Vergote ("L'exaltation du Christ en croix selon le quatrième évangile," ETL 28 [1952] 5-23, esp. pp. 19-20), H. van den Bussche (Het Boek der Passie: Verklaring van Johannes 18-21 [Het vierde evangelie 4; Tielt/The Hague: Lannoo, 1960]</page><page sequence="13">506 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 of v 35 is indeed a possible candidate as the subject of ovj/ovxai (see below). Some scholars suppose that John's only point here is that the piercing an- nounced by Zechariah has been fulfilled.45 That, however, is not probable, because the main clause of the quotation, having no referent, would then be floating in the air, and because in the comparable instance of the quotation from Ps 35:19 or 69:5 in John 15:25 the evangelist is not afraid of a drastic curtailing and change of his biblical text. There he quotes only "Who hate me without cause," a participle made substantive in both the Hebrew text and the LXX, and he makes it into an independent clause: "They hated me without cause." The question is whether the evangelist indeed intends the quotation in 19:37 to be a simple fulfillment quotation; in such a quotation the words of Scripture, whether put in the past (John 12:38; 13:18; 15:25; 19:24) or in the future (19:36), have become reality in what is told or said immediately before, and so they constitute proof that Jesus is God's eschatological envoy. On the one hand, the formula which introduces the quotation in 19:36 ("For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled") seems to apply also to the quotation in v 37 because of the indefinite plural xauxa, "these things," and the immediate succession of the two quotations. But on the other hand, the quotation in v 37 is not connected to the preceding one by a simple Kai, "and," and the verb 7r^rļpo0v, "to fulfill," is missing from the formula directly introducing it ("And again another Scripture says"). So v 37a leaves open the possibility that the evangelist does not want only to stress that Zechariah 's prophecy was realized in the piercing of Jesus' side.46 We have to ask, then, whether other passages from John can be helpful in determining the subject, the precise object, the character, and the point in time of the "looking" in 19:37.47 Many commentators have rightly connected our quotation with John 3:14-15, a passage which deals with the "effect" of the crucified Jesus on the believer.48 The one who believes in the Son of Man, 167), and Brown {John xiii-xxi, 954), who think that "the Jews" here see Christ's victory on the cross. 45 So several commentators, among them Bultmann, Johannes, 525 n. 1; C. K. Barrett, The Gospel according to St John (2d ed.; London: SPCK, 1978) 559. 46 The case of the quotation in John 12:39-40 is somewhat comparable: after adducing Isa 53: 1 as fulfilled in the unbelief of "the Jews" in 12:38, the evangelist adduces Isa 6: 10 not to stress its fulfillment but to offer an explanation for their unbelief. 47 See the survey of interpretations in C. Traets, Voir Jésus et le Père en lui, selon l'évangile de saint Jean (AnGreg 159; Rome: Universita Gregoriana, 1967) 163 n. 42. 48 Thüsing, Erhöhung, 12-31; van den Bussche, Boek der Passie, 167-68; F.-M.

The parallelism between 3:14-15, with its allusion to Num 21:8-9, and our quotation becomes still clearer when one realizes that the "seeing" of the serpent from Numbers is paralleled in John 3:15 by "believing."49 The sequel to 3:14-15 shows that people can look towards the crucified one not only with belief but also with unbelief, although God's primary intention in sending the Son is that people believe, and so have life instead of being condemned (3:16-18). The two other Johannine passages concerned with the lifting up of Jesus move along the same lines. In 8:28, the aspect of judgment on unbelief seems stressed: when "the Jews" have lifted up the Son of Man, they will know that he is "I am."50 In 12:32, the aspect of life for the believer is brought forward: when Jesus is lifted up from the earth, he will draw all to himself. The quotation in 19:37, seen in connection with 3:14-15 and the related passages, means that all will look on the pierced Jesus, and that they should look with faith, toward their salvation,51 although there will also be people who look with unbelief. This explanation concurs with the way the Fourth Evangelist speaks of "seeing Jesus."52 Apart from those instances where he uses verbs of seeing for the merely physical perception of Jesus (such as 1 1 :32), he often employs them to indicate seeing Jesus with faith (6:40; 9:37; 12:21 ,45; 14:9) or with unbelief (6:36; 15:24). In John, these verba videndi are used especially for the perception of the risen Jesus, which will be discussed below. The "looking on the pierced one" of which the quotation in 19:37 speaks, should not be taken in a too narrowly literal sense. In fact, only a very limited number of people saw Jesus hanging on the cross. The evangelist, of course, thinks also of the Christian community's proclamation of the crucified Jesus, who can be "seen" in the proclaimed gospel, just as Paul can write to the Galatians that "Jesus Christ was publicly displayed as crucified before [their] Schnackenburg, "Schriftzitat," 245; J. T. Forestell, The Word of the Cross: Salvation as Reve- lation in the Fourth Gospel (AnBib 57; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1974) 89, 197; S . Pancaro, The Law in the Fourth Gospel : The Torah and the Gospel, Moses and Jesus, Judaism and Chris- tianity according to John (NovTSup 42; Leiden: Brill, 1975) 352; Seynaeve, "Citations," 73-75; Moo, Old Testament, 214 (as a possibility); De Ru, "Zij zullen zien," 202-3; I. de la Potterie, " 'Volgeranno lo sguardo a colui che hanno trafìtto*: Sangue di Cristo e obi at i vita," La Civiltà Cattolica 137 (1986) 105-18, esp. pp. 107-8. 49 See Thüsing, Erhöhung, 7; Pancaro, Law, 333-34. 50 It is not quite clear whether Jesus* saying in 8:28 is about condemnation or about salvation. The context suggests the former. For the other interpretation see esp. Thüsing, Er- höhung, 15-19. 51 In its original context in Zechariah, Zech 12:10 is a promise of salvation. 52 See Traets, Voir Jésus, passim.</page><page sequence="15">508 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 eyes" (Gal 3:1). The positive reaction, the "looking on whom they have pierced" at which the evangelist aims, is a faith which sees in the crucified Jesus not the human failure but the exalted, glorified Son of Man (3:14-15; 12:23,32,34; 13:31-32), and which maybe also sees in the blood and water flowing out of his pierced side the gift of life (19:34, parallel with 7:38-39).53 It should be stressed that, for John, to look on the pierced Jesus with belief coincides with seeing the risen Lord. Jesus announces in his farewell discourses to his disciples that they will see him again after a short time (14: 19; 16:16-19). The privilege of seeing Jesus after his death is denied to "the world," however. "The world" can see only Jesus' dead body, but those who believe in Jesus see him, because he is alive and they will also live (14:19, cf. 14:20-24). A true look on the pierced Jesus, as the source of life for his followers, is possible only after his death, for those who see the risen Lord. It is not astonishing, therefore, that we can observe that the quotation of 19:37 comes true in the appearance stories of John 20. Mary Magdalene tells the disciples: "I have seen the Lord" (20:18). When Jesus appears to the disciples, he shows them his pierced side, and they rejoice when they see him (20:20). Later, they say to Thomas: "We have seen the Lord" (20:25). When Jesus appears to the disciples, including Thomas, he invites Thomas to place his hand in his pierced side, and he reacts to Thomas' confession with the words: "You have believed because you have seen me;54 happy are those who have not seen, and believe" (20:27-29). The macarism concerns the later generations, who did not "physically" see the risen Lord as the disciples saw him but who can only believe on the basis of their testimony. As believers who "see" the risen Lord in the preaching of the church, they can be said to belong also to those who "shall look on him whom they have pierced." The promise of 14: 19 concerns them as well. Several of the texts just referred to have clear literary links with the quotation in 19:37: o'|/£a0e (16:16,17,19), éápaica (20: 18), iSóvxsç (20:20,29), écúpáKa^sv (20:25), écbpaicaç (20:29), always with Jesus as object, can be put beside övj/ovxai in the quotation, and Jesus' pierced side, of which the quotation speaks, is expressly mentioned as seen by the disciples in 20:20,25,27. In John, the believing look on the pierced Jesus 53 Although it is not easy to determine the exact tenor of 19:34b, the interpretation which sees in the blood and water a symbol of the salvation which is realized in Jesus* death is one which should be taken seriously because of the parallelism with 7:38-39 (read with a full stop after ¿né in v 38). One of the possible scriptural sources for v 38 is Zech 13:1, from the same context as our quotation (cf. Zech 14:8). 54 Reading these words as a question ("Have you believed because you have seen me?") makes them a reproach, which they cannot possibly be in their context.</page><page sequence="16">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 509 consists in seeing the risen Lord, either directly or in the proclamation of the church, or, to put it more exactly, in seeing in the crucified Jesus the risen Lord, and vice versa. It is not without reason that in John 20 the risen Lord who appears bears the marks of his crucifixion.55 The interpretation of the quotation from Zech 12:10 in its Johannine context proposed here can be confirmed by traditio-historical considera- tions. We observed above that the current early Christian interpretation of Zech 12:10 is an eschatological one: the prophecy is applied to Christ's parousia. This interpretation, known to Matthew and to the author of the Apocalypse, certainly antedates the redaction of the Fourth Gospel, and we may suppose that it was known to the author of the Fourth Gospel, who quotes Zech 12:10 in the common early Christian form of the text.56 Now we can easily observe in John a tendency to interpret traditions concerning future eschatology within the framework of a realized eschatology (see, e.g., 4:21-26; 5:19-27; 6:30-35), without entirely excluding future escha- tology (see esp. 5:28-29). Such an interpretation occurs in the farewell discourses, where traditions which originally concerned Christ's parousia are now applied to his resurrection. The "messianic woes," vividly de- scribed in Mark 13 parr, and in many other apocalyptic writings, are interpreted in John as the temporary grief of the disciples because of Jesus' absence between his death and his resurrection (16:20-22). 57 With regard to Jesus' "coming" in 14:18, C. K. Barrett remarks that it is "by no means impossible that John consciously and deliberately used language appli- cable to both the resurrection and the parousia , thereby emphasizing the eschatological character of the resurrection."58 That the disciples will see Jesus again after his return (16:16-19), is, then, an interpretation of the eschatological seeing of the Son of Man described, e.g., in Mark 13:26 parr.; 14:62 par. (see n. 28 above).59 John's use of Zech 12:10, traditionally applied to the parousia , moves along the same line: the future looking on 55 Cf. Heer, Durchbohrte, 147-52. 56 According to Lindars (NT Apologetic, 124-27) and C. H. Dodd ( Historical D'adi t ion in the Fourth Gospel [Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1963] 132 n. 3), the application of Zech 12:10 to Jesus* crucifixion is primary, and to his parousia secondary. However, the escha- tological interpretation, which also determines the form of the text (see above), is older than John's final redaction, and John more often interprets eschatological traditions in a realized sense (see below). 57 See, e.g., Barrett, St. John, 493. 58 Ibid., 464. 59 See Kremer, "ópáto, ktä..," 1290, on John 16:16-19: "Die apokalyptische Redeweise wird in der Abschiedsrede in Form der präsentischen Eschatologie wiedergegeben."</page><page sequence="17">510 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 55, 1993 the pierced one is interpreted in John as taking place when people look in faith on the crucified Jesus as the risen Lord.60 This seeing of Jesus will, according to John, be consummated in the eschatological future (17:24, cf. 12:26; 14:3), and it may be that in that sense the traditional eschatological interpretation of Zech 12: 10 plays a certain part in the quotation in John 19:37. That does not mean, however, that one should interpret the quotation as one saying essentially the same thing as Rev 1:7.61 The main difference is that the evangelist, in using the quotation, is primarily interested in realized eschatology. Moreover, he considers the future escha- tological seeing of Christ as something destined only for believers: "the world" will not see Jesus (see, e.g., 14:19). If the above interpretation of the quotation in 19:37 is correct, the fulfillment formula of 19:36a can yet be said to apply to it. In 19:35, between the narrative of the piercing of Jesus' side and the OT quotations, the evan- gelist inserts a remark about the testimony of the eyewitness. He is called ó écopaKcòç, "the one who has seen." He has borne a true witness, "that you too (Kai u^ieïç)62 may believe." "Too" implies that the eyewitness himself is also a believer. He has seen the piercing of Jesus' side, and he has believed. In that quality, he is the first one of those "who shall look on him whom they have pierced."63 The eyewitness is probably the beloved disciple mentioned in 19:26-27; he would fit quite well in the terms of the quotation, since he functions in John as the ideal believer (13:21-30; 19:26-27; 20:2-10; 21). Here, he represents all believers, and his looking on the pierced Jesus is a repre- sentative fulfillment of Zechariah's prophecy. 60 Cf.

For Deissmann ( Veröffentlichungen , 70 n. 6) this is the only Johannine application of the quotation, and it explains why the evangelist chooses oiļ/oviai in the quotation; but see above for a more probable explanation of this choice. For Traets ( Voir Jésus, 165) and M.-E. Boismard and A. Lamouille ( L'évangile de Jean [Synopse des quatre évangiles en français 3; Paris: Cerf, 1977] 446, 451), the quotation also applies to the Roman soldiers who see Jesus and pierce him, and so to all future Gentile believers. However, John does not mention the soldiers' looking upon Jesus after they have pierced him; an episode comparable to the confession of the centurion in Mark 15:39 parr, is not found in John. Of course, Gentile believers are included in the universal subject of öyovxai as we have explained above.</page><page sequence="18">THE QUOTATION FROM ZECHARIAH IN JOHN 19:37 511 IV. Conclusion The peculiar form of the quotation from Zech 12: 10 in John 19:37 is that of an early Christian Greek translation of the Hebrew text. This form of the text is also found or presupposed at other places in early Christian literature where Zech 12:10aß is quoted or alluded to. Zech 12: 10(-14) was used as a testimonium concerning the parousia of Christ, and that use explains the peculiarities of the early Christian form of the text in comparison with the other known textual forms of the passage. For his OT quotations, John usually uses the LXX (1:23; 2:17; 6:31,45; 10:34; 12:13,38; 16:22; 19:24; cf. 12:15, with the influence of several other OT texts); in the few instances where he deviates from it (12:40; 13: 18) he has good reasons to do so.64 In 19:37, the LXX version would not have served his purposes, as the piercing is absent from it. So he chose the text of the testimonium with which he was familiar, and which fitted in well with his vocabulary and theology. The quotation in its Johannine context refers primarily to the look in which believers will see the pierced Jesus as who he really is: the exalted Son of Man, the risen Lord. It is a fulfillment quotation in the sense that the eyewitness in 19:35 is the first of these believers. Secondarily, unbelievers are in view in the sense that they also see the crucified Jesus, but not as who he really is. John uses the quotation, which was interpreted in an eschatological sense already before the Fourth Gospel was written, in the framework of his realized eschatology: the eschatological look on the pierced one occurs when believers see in the crucified Jesus the risen Lord, and in the risen Lord the crucified Jesus.65 64 See my articles mentioned in n. 2 above. 65 I thank Mrs. K.
