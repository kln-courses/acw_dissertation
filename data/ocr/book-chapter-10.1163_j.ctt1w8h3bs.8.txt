This impressive piece of historical research is divided into three main parts. In a preliminary section Alexandre first gives a brief survey of the study of the transmission of the corpus Philonicum inmodern scholarship and announces the theme of her article, namely to present some reflections on the Latin titles now in general use in Philonic scholarship. In the first part of the article she shows how the replacement of Greek titles by Latin ones is part of the humanist tradition, and is illustrated by the history of Philonic editions fromTurnebus to Arnaldez– Pouilloux–Mondésert. She then goes on in the second part to examine the Latin tradition of Philo’s reception in antiquity (Jerome, Rufinus, the Old Latin translation) in order to see whether the titles transmitted by it were influential in determining the Latin titles used in the editions. This appears to have hardly been the case. In the third part the titles now in use are analysed. Most of them were invented by the humanists of the Renaissance and the succeeding period; only a few are the work of philologists of the th century. The article ends with an appendix in which the origin of all the titles now in use is indicated in tabular form. (DTR) 9702. R. Alston, ‘Philo’s In Flaccum: Ethnicity and Social Space in Roman Alexandria,’ Greece &amp; Rome  () –. This paper aims to show that the buildings of Alexandria were significant symbols of group identity, and that by excluding the Jewish community from this urban space, the rioters in  c.e. enforced a particular interpretation of the urban community. The author suggests that it was also Philo’s view that the riots were primarily concerned with the identity and culture of the city and the phys- ical integration of the Jewish community. In his analysis of Philo’s In Flaccum, Alston focuses on the role of social structures and groups, and of buildings, dis- tricts and streets. He concludes that the Jewish view of Alexandria was of sep- arate communities which were each integral to the whole, i.e. a multi-cultural society. This was directly contrary to Roman views. The Jews failed to convince the Romans of the integral position of their community within the city. (HMK) 9703. S. C.

Subordinatingmundane ties of all kindswas a rhetorical theme and a mode of action deeply rooted in the tradition of Jewish monotheism, and not without analogy in the Greco-Roman traditions concerning the cost of conversion to the life of the philosopher. The article presents the evidence found in Philo, Josephus, the Cynics and the Stoa. Philo’s presuppositions are demonstrated from Spec. .–, i.e., his comment on Deut :– (warn- ing against going after false prophets). The author then briefly presents what Philo says on proselytes, the Therapeutae (their ascetism and their community as a spiritual family), and on heroic individuals as the patriarchs and other lead- ers of the people of Israel (who subordinate family ties for a greater cause).

In the context of an understanding of the story of Jesus brought before the Jewish leadership for examination (Mark :–) the author discusses some key passages from Judaism on blasphemy and exaltation to the side of God. For Philo comparing oneself to God is a blasphemous act (Somn. .–, Decal. –).His view is rooted in the interpretation of the first commandment. In several passages Philo presents Moses as an exalted figure, who is called ‘friend of God’ and ‘God to Pharaoh’ (Mos. ., Sacr. ). He appears to have a kind of divine status. The exaltation of Moses occurs also in Ezekiel Tragicus. (ACG) 9705. J. den Boeft and D. T. Runia (edd.), Arche: a Collection of Patristic Studies by J. C.

In this collection of  articles and reviews written by the emeritus Professor of Later Greek Literature of the University of Leiden over a period of  years, a section has been devoted to articles on Philo. Reprinted are R-R , , . But because the collection concentrates largely on the Alexandrian tradi- tion of Patristic thought, many of the remaining articles refer to Philo (see the Index locorum on pp. –) or are relevant to the study of his thought. In particular we draw attention to the paper originally published in aDutch version by the Royal DutchAcademy in  (=R-R ), which is now published in an English version entitled ‘ ‘Idea’ and ‘Matter’ in the Early Christian Exegesis of the First Words of Genesis: a Chapter in the Encounter between Greek Philosophy and Christian Thought’.

This monograph represents a synoptic presentation of the author’s research on Philo during the last decade. The introduction discusses whether Philo was a mystic, philosopher or exegete. Borgen himself sees correct observations behind the different options, but finds the last one the most relevant. The first two chap- ters account for Philo himself and his historical environment.The thirteen chap- ters that follow give, in addition to some other themes, a comprehensive treat- ment of Philo as an interpreter of the Scriptures. A typical feature of the book is that the author makes use of his own texts published elsewhere. Thus chapter  ‘Reviewing and Rewriting Biblical Material’ differs but slightly from the text in the article published in SPhA vol.  and summarized below . Chapter , ‘Rewritten Bible?’, demonstrates how Philo follows Jewish tradition in retelling the biblical story of the Pentateuch. Chapter , ‘Questions and Answers’, per- taining to Philo’s exegetical use of questions and answers, is followed by three chapters discussing specific books in the Philonic corpus, Gig., Deus and Leg. . In chapter , ‘Proclamatio Graeca—Hermeneutical Key’, Borgen analyses Philo’s idea that the Greek translation of the Bible was a decisive event in God’s reve- latory history. Three levels of interpretation of the biblical text can be detected in Philo’s expositions of the Law of Moses: one referring to specific ordinances, one to cosmic principles and one to the transcendent world. The relationship between Jews and non-Jews is discussed in chapters ,  and , ‘Tension and Influence’, ‘TheConflict’ and ‘Reaching Out and Coming In’, whereas chapter , ‘Illegitimate and Legitimate Ascents’, compares the illegitimate invasion of Gaius Caligula into the divine world with the legitimate ascent of Moses. For this section see Borgen’s Early Christianity and Hellenistic Judaism, , ff. (= RRS ). In chapter , ‘Man andGod’s People within a Cosmic Context’, Bor- gen elaborates upon a theme discussed in a previous article, ‘Man’s Sovereignty over Animals etc.’, published in  (= RRS ). Chapter , ‘Philanthropia and the Laws of Moses’, approximates the article ‘Philanthropia in Philo’s Writ- ings’, also published in  and mentioned in the bibliography of the volume (= RRS ). In the final chapter, ‘A Conditioned Future Hope’, Borgen places Philo’s eschatological ideaswithin the general framework of his thought.Thevol- ume ends with a concluding summary. Reviews: A.

Sterling (edd.), Wisdom and Logos: Studies in Jewish Thought in Honor of David Winston [=The Stu- dia Philonica Annual  ()], Brown Judaic Studies  (Atlanta ) –. The area of Philo’s activity as an exegete analysed in this article is the para- phrastic reviewing and rewriting of smaller and larger biblical units. For exam- ple, by taking a model from Deut Philo in Praem. presents a series of blessings tied to a series of curses. In a way that is quite similar to several early Jewish writings Philo in Virt. gives lists of biblical persons with the aim of creating a contrast between excellent and unworthy characters. In Leg.  such a listing of persons is combined with the theme of predestination which is articulated in transitional passages. Here Borgen makes some comparisons with Paul’s ideas in Rom . In discussion with P. S. Alexander the author points out the fact that Philo in rewriting biblical passages also incorporates presentations of laws (e.g. Hypoth., Decal. and Spec.). There are similarities with Josephus which suggest a common source for the two Jewish authors. The ethical notions which Philo develops in his rewritten Bible have both a Jewish and a Greek background. (KGS) 9708. F. Calabi, ‘Lingua di Dio, lingua degli uomini: Filone Alessan- drino e la traduzione della Bibbia,’ I castelli di Yale  () –. Hebrew was the normal language which all humans spoke before the tower of Babel. Moreover it was the language that God spoke at the time of creation. The language of Adam corresponded perfectly to the nature of things. But then the problem arises: is this correspondence maintained in the Greek translation of the Bible? Philo’s answer is positive. Greek is perfectly able to replace the Hebrew and corresponds perfectly to reality because the translation was inspired byGod.The choice of Greek was not amatter of chance or opportunism, but was according to Calabi ‘ideological’, because it allowed the translators to make use of the considerable resources of thought which theGreek language allowed them to express. (RR) 9709. G. Casadio, Vie gnostiche all’immortalità (Brescia ), esp. –. Philo’s concept of immortality is strongly influenced by Platonism and thus subscribes to a clear form of dualism. Only the soul is destined for immortality and not the body, which is regarded as ontologically inferior. (RR) 9710. R. A.

The author shows that the majority of Philo’s quotations from the Latter Prophets occur in theHaftarah cycle, and especially in theHaftarah of ‘admoni- tion, consolation, and repentance’. Of the  quotations in Philo from the Latter Prophets  contain verses found in this specific Haftarah cycle. This result is all the more striking given the very few non-Pentateuchal references in Philo. The author concludes that the traditional string of Haftaroth—admonition, consolation, repentance—existed already in Philo’s time. The author’s thesis has been more fully developed in her monograph Philo’s Scriptures: Citations from the Prophets and Writings: Evidence for a Haftarah Cycle in Second Tem- ple Judaism, Journal for the Study of Judaism Supplements  (Leiden ).

A thorough survey of all the passages in which Philo appears to refer to individual books of the Pentateuch. These are very infrequent when seen in relation to the countless references Philo makes to scripture as a whole. For the book Genesis there are at most four instances. Philo does not use the name  Ε  δ ς, but replaces it with !Ε αγωγ , the reason for this being, it is surmised, that the other name was associated with the theatre. The name Leviticus is used three times, Numbers not at all. The most complex case is Deuteronomy. This name is used twice only. Scholars have often thought that Philo uses alternative names to refer to this book, such asΠρ τρεπτικ ς,Παρα νεσις and !Επ ν μις. The author examines all these instances and determines that they are not synonyms for the final book of the Pentateuch. By way of conclusion it is argued that Philo always considered the Pentateuch as a whole as his point of reference and as a conceptual unit. For this reason the references to individual books are so infrequent. (DTR) 9713. T. M. Conley, ‘Philo of Alexandria,’ in S. E. Porter (ed.), Handbook of Classical Rhetoric in the Hellenistic Period B.C.–A.D.  (Leiden ) –. </page> <page sequence="8">  part two The crucial importance of Philo’s rhetorical practices has only recently been acknowledged, but the last twenty-five years of the th century have seen a number of studies in this field. The aim of Conley’s contribution on Philo in this handbook is to demonstrate how Philo’s rhetoric ‘works’. The discussion is divided in sections on (I) Style, (II) Sentence Composition, (III) Modes of Amplification, (IV) Topoi, (V) Beyond the Period: ΤΑ$ΙΣ, and (VI)TheDebate Setting.The author concludeswith regard to ‘the pervasive presence of rhetorical intention’ in Philo’s writings that there is unmistakable evidence for Philo’s awareness of the lessons taught by Hellenistic rhetoricians. ‘His hermeneutical practices, far from being adapted to the services of some philosophical system, were fundamentally rhetorical.’ (p. ) (HMK) 9714. B. Decharneux, ‘De l’ evidence de l’ existence de Dieu et de l’ efficacité des ses puissances dans la théologie philonienne,’ in C. Lévy and L. Pernot (edd.),Dire l’ evidence: Philosophie et rhétorique antiques, Cahiers de philosophie de l’Université de Paris XII – Val de Marne  (Paris ) –. General reflections on the role of revelation and philosophy inPhilo’s theolog- ical and cosmological thought, as provoked by the general theme of the confer- ence, i.e. ‘dire l’ évidence’, pronouncing what is clear and evident ('ν ργεια). For Philo the clear evidence of the existence of God and the efficacy of the working of his powers in the cosmos serve to reaffirm the validity and truth of the Jewish tradition as based on divine revelation, but also allow the entry of philosophical and rational demonstration wherever this is possible. ‘Jewish thought and pagan philosophy become reconciled at the end of paths which appear to be different but in retrospect are identical.’ (p. ) The article also includes a brief discus- sion of Philo’s debate with Alexander in Prov. . Philo does not capitulate to his nephew’s arguments but calls in evidence, as well as emphasizing the limits of human knowledge. (DTR) 9715. G.-L. Devic, ‘Philon d’Alexandrie; philosophe, mais aussi histo- rien contemporain du Christ,’Cahiers du Cercle Ernest Renan  () –. After summarizing the history of Alexandria, the author gives a general presentation of Philo of Alexandria, contemporary of Jesus Christ. He first introduces him as a philosopher who at a certain stage is annexed by the church, then as a historian, and he also gives an overview of his writings. Attention is drawn to Flacc. and Legat. A parallel is established between Flacc. – (the episode of Carabas) and the scene of the crowning of Jesus (Matt :–, John :–).

The general question posed in this essay concerns Philo himself: is he a man with a distinctive philosophical position who is seeking to apply this to what he regards as a sacred inspired text, or is he a pious exegete of scrip- ture, who tries to bring in various philosophical doctrines as the text appears to demand? Dillon examines his handling of various themes in Agr. The image of philosophy as a garden allows him to take a stand on a number of impor- tant issues in contemporary philosophy, such as the role of the passions and the status of logic. There is no question of witless vacillation. Philo knows exactly what he is about. Of the two alternatives sketched above, the author has no compunction in settling for the former as presenting the truer picture. (DTR) 9718. D. S. Du Toit, Theios Anthropos. Zur Verwendung von  ε( ς )ν ρωπ ς und sinnverwandten Ausdrücken in der Literatur der Kaiser- zeit, Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuem Testament . (Tübingen ), esp. –. The dissertation examines the semantics of  ε( ς, δαιμ νι ς,  εσπ σι ς applied to historical persons in the authors of the Roman empire. Against the affirmations of the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule these terms never ascribe men to the class of divinities, but either they denote a religious-ethical quality or they are used technically in an epistemological context for founders of a discipline or a type of knowledge. This result is confirmed by an inquiry in Hellenistic Judaism. After a survey on the history of research the author dedicates pp. –  to the terminology in the writings of Philo: in titular function  εσπ σι ι )νδρες in Praem.  and divini viri/homines in Prov. . and  mean pagan initiators of philosophical knowledge.The expression can, however, be used also for the Jewish authors of the Law (Migr. ) or the Psalms (Plant. ). ‘The divine prophet’ ofMos. . could be understood in this sense, if the expression </page> <page sequence="10">  part two does not have a relational meaning. In Spec. . and .  εσπ σι ι )νδρες are authoritative interpreters of the Law. In other places (Virt. , —not related to Moses) the adjectives have an ethical denotation and are parallel to *ερ ς, +σι ς,  ε  ιλ ς. (DZ) 9719. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo,’ in W. W.

Attractive brief general presentation of Philo in his historical context, both as an Alexandrian and as a Jew. Feldman retains the view of Wolfson that Philo’s thought is a crucial turning point in the history of philosophy. He is important for an understanding of the spiritual crisis of the first century. It is concluded that he emerges as a truly enigmatic character. Though strongly influenced by Greek thought, in his Jewish context he was realistic enough to see the dangers of extremism. (DTR) 9720. S. de Francesco, ‘Filone maestro di esegesi nelle Quaestiones. Interpretare domandando e coordinando,’ Ricerche Teologiche  () –. The article, based on a detailed analysis (applying  parameters) of Quaes- tiones (QG .–.), focuses on the role of the quaestio (as distinct from the solutio) in the exegetical act, and on the ‘coordination’ of textual data per- formed by the exegete in order to achieve a literal or allegorical interpretation. A study of the formulation of the quaestio, and how the biblical lemma in it has been ‘cut out’, leads to the conclusion that in the quaestio the exegetical act is already in progress, and that there are often indications in it of the exegete’s ‘pre-understanding’ of the text. The exegetical ‘coordination’ on the level of lit- eral interpretation aims at establishing the coherence of textual data through explanation of extraordinary facts and possible contradictions, and through ref- erences to the (wider) context of the lemma and to interpretations by other exegetes. On the allegorical level, the interpretation obtains its coherence from the exegete’s ‘guiding idea’: in Philo’s case the idea that a dramatic, existential trial purges the soul from its passions. The literal and allegorical interpretation of a single lemma may be either completely unrelated, or run parallel, or be in contrast, or be unequal (allegory dominating the letter). QG . (on Gen .) presents an interesting case of both the letter (speaking of rituals) and the alle- gory having an equally spiritual significance. As for Philo’s ‘pre-understanding’ of the text, decisive here is his conviction that God is absolutely transcendent, immutable, benevolent, and acting according to the principles of harmony and order. It is concluded that Philo’s Quaestiones are above all exegetical in nature; that they constantly aim at an equilibrium between letter and allegory; and that they display a profound conviction and awareness of the unity of Scripture. Fur- ther study of the aspects of unity, internal connections and coordination in the Quaestionesmay deepen our understanding of Philo’s approach to the Bible and on the enduring value of his exegetical teaching.

Gruen (edd.), Hellenistic Constructs: Essays in Culture, History andHistoriography (Berkeley ) –. The Stoics considered slavery, in contrast to legal slavery, to be ‘a moral condition characteristic of people who allowed themselves to be dominated by passions and emotions’. The famous early Stoic paradox, ‘every good man is free, every bad man a slave’, survives only in the writings of Cicero, Philo, and Ambrose. Attempting to identify the view of Middle Stoics, Garnsey considers passages attributed by modern scholars to Posidonius as well as citations of Posidonius in ancient works. He findsMiddle Stoic views on slavery to be elusive and probably not very different from earlier Stoic positions. Philo’s focus in Prob. – upon moral—as opposed to legal—slavery or freedom, is probably characteristic of Middle Stoic views. (EB) 9722. P. von Gemünden, ‘La femme passionnelle et l’homme ration- nel? un chapitre de psychologie historique,’ Biblica  () –. The study examines the manner in which the relation between logos/nous and the passions depends on sexual stereotyping which both is derived from daily relations between men and women and at the same time determines such relations. In this article the author examines these stereotypes by studying texts derived from three traditions, the Medea of Euripides, Maccabees, and the Philonic corpus. From Philo’s writings the stereotype that being female or feminine is equivalent to being dominated by the passions emerges clearly. But in two cases Philo distances himself from it. Spiritual progress can be described as a transformation in which women become masculine, yet when the summit of the spiritual journey is reached it is man who has to become woman. The reversal of values always takes place in relation to God, in the sense that God is the instigator of virtue. (JR) 9723. C.

In her mainly synchronic analysis of this apologetic work (with encomias- tic features) the author, after introductory remarks on its literary genre and integrity, concentrates on its third part (.–) and the picture of Judaism presented there. However, since Philo’sHypoth. has a similar apologetic purpose, a comparative examination seems appropriate. Beside correspondences in the description ofMoses and the Exodus, the function of the Sabbath, and especially the harsh sanctions (cf. Hypoth. .f, with Josephus Ap. .–), differences in content are noted. The result of the examination is that it cannot be excluded but neither can it be proved that Josephus drew on Philo. Since with regard to </page> <page sequence="12">  part two the epitome of the Law in .– not only Philo Hypoth., but also Pseudo- Phocylides offer parallels, even though these are stylistically quite different, a common stock (‘fonds’) has to be postulated. In that work OT laws were put together eclectically, without the typical Jewish rules, for the use of non-Jews. On p.  peculiarities of Josephus’ text are listed. An excursus on its relationship to the Laws of Plato (pp. –) may be interesting for Philonists as well. (DZ) 9724. R. Goldenberg, The Nations That Know Thee Not: Ancient Jewish Attitudes toward Other Religions (Sheffield ), esp. –, – . Material from Philo is extensively used in this study of ancient Jewish atti- tudes towards other peoples and other religions. The chapter entitled ‘Judaism at War (II)’, which treats Jewish literary polemic, commences with Philo’s stric- tures against polytheism in Decal. and uses it to structure the discussion. In the following chapter entitled ‘Judaism at Peace,’ Philo, though called ‘the philosoph- ical scourge of polytheism,’ is interpreted as providing evidence of a softer view of pagan religions. This chapter also includes a discussion of Philo’s exegesis of the LXX rendering of Exod :. (DTR) 9725. R. Goldenberg, ‘The Septuagint Ban on Cursing the Gods,’ Journal for the Study of Judaism  () –. Exod : (LXX ) ‘Do not curse elohim is rendered by the LXX as ‘Do not speak ill of gods’. This is a surprising utterance in the light of the habitual polemics of the Torah and the prophets against other nations’ gods. Philo offers three explanations of this ban: Spec. ., Mos. ., QE .. Goldenberg summarizes them as follows: () the name ‘god’ should never be taken lightly, even when it is wrongly applied (Mos.); () praise is always better than attack (QE); religious polemic leads to social violence and should therefore be avoided (QE); mockery of idols can provoke blasphemy of the true God, while respect toward idols can elicit praise of the true God (Spec., QE). A similar approach is found in Josephus. Other literary materials, however, show this law to have been a dead letter. Rabbinic literature, for instance, is full of mockery of Gentile gods. The author suggests that ‘the LXX presents here an early example of Jewish community-relations publicity, a short-lived project, probably centered in Alexandria, aimed at convincing Gentiles that Jews are friendly people who seek to get along with everyone. The brief history of the theme in ancient Jewish (and Christian) literature suggests the effort quickly failed’. (HMK) 9726. K. Grayston, ‘TheMeaning of ‘Parakletos’,’ in S. E. Porter and C. A.

For Philo a woman is inferior to a man by nature. The place of a woman is in the domestic sphere, while the man belongs to the public sphere. In Philo’s allegory ‘female’ stands for passion, sense-perception, passivity etc.; man represents mind, self- control, activity etc. In order to attain divine wisdom one has to lay off the female sphere of body and passion, and to become ‘male’. When a woman wishes to attain divine insight, she has to become a virgin. The boundary between men and women disappears in the return to the original Adam, which is an incorporeal androgyne, neither male nor female. With regard to woman and gender, there are differences and similarities between Philo and Paul. Both see an ideal humanity that is beyond gender and inequality. Philo, having a Platonic denigration of the body, bases his ideal of androgyny on the denial of the body in the incorporeal Adam. Paul, on the other hand, bases the equality between man and woman on baptismal unification with Christ. (ACG) 9728. K. Haacker, ‘Die Geschichtstheologie von Röm – im Lichte philonischer Schriftauslegung,’ New Testament Studies  () – . Philo can illuminate some traditional material in Paul.Thus the relativization of descent in Rom :b– recalls Philo’s reflections on noble birth (Virt. – ), esp. the examplesVirt. – (cf.Praem. –). Paul, however, excludes virtue as a criterion. Philo sees proselytes as compensation for the falling away of Israelites (Praem. ), just as Paul sees the Christians with a pagan origin. As common base Deut :ff., esp. verses  f., is postulated, where the losses of Israel mean gain for the pagans. Both authors consider the time when Israel is fallen in disfavour as limited; the restitution of Israel will be salvific for the world (cf.Mos. . f. withRom:, ).These commonviews at least partially can be explained by a similar reception of certain biblical texts. But the author also considers it possible that Paul deliberately included Philonic material in the letter to the Romans, because knowledge of the writings of Philo in Rome could be presupposed.

In his Leiden dissertation the author gives a careful discussion on the excerpt from the Genesis Commentary of Eusebius of Emesa in the Catena (Petit no. ) in which appears to be quoted. It is not so likely that Eusebius was the intermediary, since he does not cite Philo anywhere else and moreover this would be his only quotation from another author.

Right conduct is a necessary prerequisite of worship, prayer included. Prayer and praise from a devoted heart is better than literal sacrifices. In Philo’s works four prayers can be found, two of which (Migr.  and Spec. .–) are discussed by G. E. Sterling further on in the Anthology (see below ).

Thirdly the reverse procedure is followed and the passage is used to illuminate the treatise. The author concludes in a final section that the passage should not be regarded as the master key to the entire work, but it is well integrated into it and is not a ‘foreign body’ within it. It is possible that the passage does not refer to a special group, but rather to a class of individuals. Themain reason for mentioning them is hermeneutical, i.e. to teach his readers that both literal and allegorical interpretation is necessary, and that spiritual development requires not bodiless existence but the exercise of self-mastery.

Since the entire passage is rooted in Wisdom theology, there is a traditional place for the cultic function ofWisdom as well.The formulation ‘cleansing from sin’, however, refers to the death of Jesus against the background of the day of reconciliation. For the specific idea of the letter, namely that the High Priest offers himself as sacrifice, the author adduces as parallel Philo’s text Fug. –, where in an exposition of Num  the death of the High Priest, identified with the Logos, is connected with the ritual of Lev . Even if in Philo’s psychological application this death means something wholly different from the dying of the High Priest Jesus, the Logos is described in terms reminiscent of Hebrews as cosmic bond and as immaculate. Somn. . even speaks of the High Priest offering himself. (DZ) 9734.

This article deals with the so-called catechetical school in Alexandria. The prime source for this school is Eusebius, from whom Van den Hoek quotes the passages in which he refers to a διδασκαλε( ν in Alexandria. The Alexandrian school was closely related to Philo. The link with Philo was a literary heritage: Clement and Origen saw Philo as part of their own tradition. Both had access to Philo’s writings, which occupy a place in the library in Alexandria. The question as to how Philo’s writings were transmitted in the first and second century, however, has to remain unclear. (ACG) 9735. S.

Sterling (edd.), Wisdom and Logos: Studies in Jewish Thought in Honor of David Winston [= The Studia Philonica Annual  ()], Brown Judaic Studies  (Atlanta ) –. In this lengthy and learned paper the author attempts to demonstrate that the relationship between Judaeo-Hellenistic interpretation and the Peripatetic/Alex- andrian tradition may have been deeper than has been acknowledged. He aims to reconstruct, primarily from the Philonic corpus, a theory about the genres of the Pentateuch which may go back to a time when the Peripatetic/Alexandrian tradition rather than the Stoic/Pergamene approach was dominant. The first section of the paper, entitled ‘The genres of Philo and those of Peripatetic the- ory’, argues that the cosmological, the historical/genealogical, and the legislative genre as found by Philo in the Pentateuch (see Praem. ff. and Mos. .ff.) correspond with three genres of poetry distinguished in the Tractatus Coislini- anus and Diomedes. Section II (‘The Pentateuch and poetry’) deals with the theory that in ancient times written discourse was generally in poetic form, whereas prose was a later development: Philo in Det.  refers to the Penta- teuch as ‘divine poetry’. The theory indicated here may have reached Philo via Peripatetic sources. Section III is entitled ‘Non-mythical and non-mimetic lit- erature’. Philo’s statement, again in Det. , that the Pentateuch contains no myth (the same in Josephus), seems to put it in the category of non-mythical poetry as described, e.g., by Plutarch—‘myth’ is here an approximate equiva- lent of the Aristotelian term ‘mimesis’. In Section IV (‘The three genres as seen from the literalist perspective’) it is argued that the tripartite scheme of Pen- tateuchal genres is essentially literalist, since it allows one to establish the pri- marily didactic telos of the Pentateuch without an appeal to allegory. Philo in Conf. ff. acknowledges the legitimacy of the ‘literalist’ approach, although his own approach to the problems of the literal text is an allegorical one.The author </page> <page sequence="17"> critical studies   discusses a number of scholarly explanations of Philo’s (surprising) claim that there is no myth in the Pentateuch, notably the one of G. Delling. The literalist approach is evidenced by remarks of Josephus, whose theory and practice are not without contradictions. Kamesar sets out to provide the theoretical foundations for the literalist position, which in his view was based on an appeal to literary genre. Such a ‘generic’ solution to the problem of apparent myth in the Pentateuch stands in stark contrast to the solution generally associated with Hellenistic Judaism and Philo involving an attempt to ‘heal’ the apparent myth by means of an appeal to allegory, i.e. not a ‘generic’ but a hermeneutical approach (pp. –). In section V Kamesar considers by way of analogy Proclus’ theory about Homer’s poetry in his Commentary on Plato’s Republic. Section VI gives a ‘Summary and explanation of the origins and disappearance of the literalist approach’. Judaeo-Hellenistic grammatikoi somewhere around  b.c.e. came to compare the Pentateuch with Greek works written in the archaic age (such as of Empedocles and Hesiod), that is, not exclusively with Homer, nor yet with Plato. Later on the literary texts which came to be most often juxtaposed with the Pentateuch were the works of both Homer and Plato. But before the domination of the allegorical approach, there was still significant distance between these two, and there was room for a ‘literal’Moses in that space (p. ). (HMK) 9738. A. Kerkeslager, Jewish Pilgrimage and Jewish Identity in Hel- lenistic and Early Roman Egypt (diss. University of Pennsylvania ). This study advances the understanding of ancient constructions of Jewish identity through an analysis of the ways in which Jewish identity was expressed in pilgrimage traditions in Greco-Roman Egypt. Literary, papyrological, epi- graphic and archaeological sources are used in a strongly comparative frame- work. The longest chapter includes lengthy discussions of sources related to pil- grimage to Mt. Sinai, including the Septuagint, Demetrius, Philo, Jubilees, Gala- tians, Josephus, Eusebius, and others. These sources suggest that Jews in the Greco-Roman period believed thatMt. Sinai was located in northwesternArabia near the city of Madyan (modern Al-Bad’). The study concludes that a number of factors may have played a role in the diverse expressions of Jewish identity in Egypt. Philonic evidence is used throughout and his use of ‘Arabia’ plays an important role in the discussion of Philo’s view of the location of Mt. Sinai.

In order to prove his overall thesis indicated in the subtitle, the author thinks it possible that Hellenistic Judaism transmitted Egyptian ideas of divine sonship. Therefore he first analyses the relationship of Alexandrian Jewry to Egypt. Philo (pp. –) could have been acquaintedwith Egyptian religiosity, at least in a Hellenized version. Legat. ff. alludes to Egyptian-Hellenistic ideas about the king formed already in his mother’s womb (see also the earlier article, RRS ). In Legat. and Flacc. Philo seems to accept deification on the basis of benefaction. The royal dignity of Moses also is founded in virtue. In a political context, however, Philo avoids speaking of a divine origin. This is true also for the messianic passages Praem.  and Mos. .. Differing from a collective (Joseph and Aseneth, Wisdom) or an individual-political interpretation of divine sonship, Philo gives a spiritual one. In Cher. – he conceives of generation throughGod as a spiritual event in the soul.The imagery, however, is related to pagan cults which celebrate the birth of a child generated by a god out of a virgin mother, the initiates assuming the royal role of Horus (p. ).

In this study on the rest motif in the New Testament attention is also paid to Philo. He uses the rest motif particularly in connection with the Sabbath and the number seven. Rest is an attribute of God and is related to his immutability, stability, and immovability.Humanbeings can participate inGod’s rest insofar as they stand in proximity to God.The author reports the discussion about the rest motif betweenG.Theissen andO.Hofius (cf. R-R ). AlthoughLaansmadoes not followTheissen’s view that in Philo there are different and contrasting strands of thought in the rest motif, he admits that there is a difference in emphasis between various Philonic passages (pp. –). With regard to a Philonic background of the rest motif in Hebrews, Laansma concludes that there are no strong arguments for the view that the idea of rest in Hebrews is derived from Philo (pp. –).

While Jose- phus wants to defend himself against the reproaches of Justus of Tiberias, Philo’s accusation ofGaius probably is occasioned by the rise of Claudius to the imperial throne. Josephus puts his own achievements and his character in the foreground, whereas Philo disappears behind the ‘we’ of the delegation—with the exception of §§–. He presents a picture of Jewish unity which contrasts to the many factions emerging from Josephus’ narration. Josephus has better relations to the Romans than to his own people, while Legat. reflects the menace to Jews arising from pagan fellow-citizens and the emperor. (DZ) 9747. J. R. Levison,The Spirit in First Century Judaism, Arbeiten zur Geschichte des antiken Judentums und des Urchristentums  (Leiden ), passim. In this monograph devoted to a study of how conceptions of the divine spirit underwent complexmetamorphoses in Jewish biblical interpretation three chief bodies of writing are discussed, Philo, Josephus and Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities. The main body of the book consists of three long essays. In the first, entitled ‘An anomalous prophet’, it is shown how highly divergent and creative interpretations of the spirit were drawn from Num  and its account of how the spirit descended on Balaam. The difference between Philo’s account inMos. .ff. and the biblical account is largely due to the influence of Plato’s Socrates (the same applies to Josephus), as shown in a comparison with Plutarch. The spirit thus becomes an invading angel. In the second essay, entitled ‘An eclectic era’, Levison attempts to uncover the complex impulses which propelled Jewish authors both to assimilate and to resist Greco-Roman perceptions of inspiration. In this part he examines Philo’s presentation of Abraham at Virt. – and also his descriptions of the ascent of the mind in Plant. – and Gig. –. In the third part, entitled ‘An extraordinary mind’, Levison undermines the view that in Jewish literature the spirit was associated above all with ecstasy rather thanwith intellectual insight. Philo’s view of bothMoses and Joseph is examined. Here too the influence of Socrates’ daimon is felt. A long concluding section summarizes the findings and places them in a wider context.

There appears to be a scholarly consensus that Philo’s allegorical method is deeply indebted to Stoic allegorical readings of myths and poets. Long strongly denies this view. Stoics have been commonly regarded as allegorists for three reasons: firstly because the early Stoics regularly etymologized the names of divinities; secondly because Heraclitus allegoricus was thought to be a Stoic; thirdly because of reports that they allegorized Homer and Hesiod. But none of these reasons are founded. Further confirmation can be found in the method of the Stoic Cornutus, who concentrates on etymology and does not practice allegory in the Philonic sense. It is concluded that Stoic exegesis of myth and Philo’s interpretation of scripture have little in common. Philo’s source was no doubt his Alexandrian Jewish predecessors. The article concludes with some reflections on the use of language. The Stoics would have been sympathetic to the portrayal of Adam naming the animals in Opif. ff., but not to Philo’s understanding of Moses’ practice as a conscious allegorist. (DTR) 9750. J.

According to McGinn Philo was the first thinker in the West to connect the Greek contemplative ideal to the monotheistic faith of Scripture, using above all Platonic philosophy as an apologetic instrument and also as a means to penetrate to the authentic significance of revelation. An important con- sequence was the extreme emphasis on divine transcendence and also the adap- tation of Platonic contemplation in a more personal direction. The differences between Plato and Philo can be reduced to the theme of  upsilonlenisδ νεια as condition for contemplation, which is quite foreign to Platonic views. (RR) 9755. D.

The theme of reward and punishment, tied to the exercise of divine justice, is central in the entire Philonic corpus. The author examines two groups of treatises, which appear to offer differing perspectives. In Virt. and Praem., both part of the Exposition of the Law, Philo stays close to the view of the Deuteronomist in Deut : God rewards the good and pious and punishes the wicked and impious in this life. There is a difference between the two treatises in that in Praem. God is not given the same active role that he has in Virt. But in three treatises of the Allegorical Commentary, which deal with the fates of Cain and Abel, it is apparent that Philo was preoccupied with the problem of the suffering of the righteous and the fact that Cain does not appear to receive a commensurate punishment. He thus offers an interpretation in which, despite appearances, Abel is rewarded and Cain is punished. Throughout this trilogy Philo takes care to disassociate God from the direct exercise of punishment. The reward for the good person is knowledge of all that follows in God’s wake. The article closes with some reflections on Philo’s handling of divine justice. The author hesitates to draw chronological conclusions from the differences he has noted. Rather there is a creative tension between Moses, who epitomizes Law and tradition, and Plato, who epitomizes rational enquiry. (DTR) 9757. J. Milgrom, ‘Philo the Biblical Exegete,’ in D. T.

The author, who is preparing a commentary onLeviticus, presents seven cases in which Philo (in spite of his being a ‘supreme allegorist’) throws light on the plain meaning of the literal text of Leviticus.

Advancing a suggestion by Dahl and Segal (R-R ), Naeh probes the possible link between Philonic exegesis and rabbinic midrash concerning the ‘mixing’ of these attributes. The key texts examined are Deus – and Genesis Rabbah . (on Gen :), and the author examines the possibility that the imagery of Ps  (LXX ) underlies the respective arguments regarding the mingling of justice and mercy. It is concluded, cautiously, that the ‘similarities between Philo’s discussion and the Midrash . . . suggest that both may have been based on an earlier interpretation of Ps :, already reflected in the Septuagint’ (p. ).

The fundamental problem which the author tackles is the reconstruction of the biblical text towhich Philo refers. To this end she reviews themost important scholarly treatments of the problem and concludes that it is impossible bymeans of Philo’s writings to attain the biblical text on which he was working for the reason that his citations are not exact, but are always the result of interaction with the text. The article concludes with an excursus (pp. –) in which, as demonstration of her position, she examines the biblical citations in Leg.  and compares them with the LXX text in the Göttingen edition.

In the second chapter the religious and philosophical background is surveyed and it is noted that Philo utilizes the motif of God as creator in various ways, including its use as the foundation for the praise of God.

The former reveals a full acceptance of the Philonic heritage within the bounds of his Christianity, but at a cost. The latter evaluates Philo’s method of biblical interpretation and finds it partly unsatisfactory.

The final section of Contempl. has given rise to problems: how is the text to be established, translated and interpreted? The author first cites three translations which all differ at important points. He then establishes the text, making use of parallel passages elsewhere to determine that the text should read 6 λα πρ  ε(σα and not πρ σ ε(σα. This section concludes with the author’s own translation of the sentence. In the third part an interpretation is given of the entire section, concentrating on how its main terms—excellence, friendship of God, reward of/for goodness, prosperity and felicity—relate to each other. The Therapeutae show two chief excellences, self-control and piety. When these are combined with a desire for contemplation of God, the reward of friendship with him and felicity is theirs.

The late John Whittaker in an important article argued that ancient writers often practised the ‘art of misquotation’, and so their evidence for the indirect tradition of texts has to be regarded with suspicion. In this contribution Whit- taker’s theory is tested by applying it to the  Platonic citations in Philo (this category covers both direct quotes and paraphrases, the criterion is that Philo himself makes clear that he is citing the work of another author). For each cita- tion the text is cited (with mss. variants), the Platonic passage cited is indicated and brief comments are made on the way that Philo reports or adapts it. At the end of the article four conclusions are reached. () Philo practises a good deal </page> <page sequence="27"> critical studies   of variation in his manner of citation. () In general the citations adhere rea- sonably closely to the original Platonic text. () On a number of occasions Philo ‘tampers’ with the quotation, esp. for theological reasons. () On six or seven occasions ‘retro-correction’ has occurred in the critical editions of Philo, i.e. the Philonic text has been altered to conform to the Platonic original.

After specifying the meaning and the function of the terms ‘metaphor’, ‘alle- gory’, ‘symbol’ the author sketches the history of allegorical interpretation, dis- tinguishing between a Stoic and a Platonic (‘diaeretic’) form whose first identi- fiable representative is Philo. Since there is no allegoric exposition in early Rab- binic writings, Philo’s method hardly can go back to the Palestinian haggadic midrash, but has nearly exclusively Greek roots. The method of the Quaestiones et solutiones grew out of Alexandrian philology of Homer and is exemplified on p.  f. The Allegorical commentary develops this method against a Platonic background: the ideas or powers constitute the true signification of the words. Thus beside the immediate predecessors, the Jewish allegorists from Alexan- dria, the Philonic allegory has its precedents in the Platonic-Pythagorean tra- dition which seems to be alluded to in Contempl. . For this, the Platonic use of myths may have been exemplary. Philo’s occasional polemics against a Stoic- physical explanation do not necessarily take aim at Jewish allegorists. But the existence of etymological lists presupposes Jewish exegetes under Stoic influ- ence. (DZ) 9773. Y.

The question posed by this article is how we can understand the various ways in which Philo portrays the figure of Joseph. In Ios. Philo tells Joseph’s life as the life of a statesman. According to Philo there are three prerequisites for a statesman: shepherd-craft, household management, and self-control. Joseph possesses all three prerequisites. In Somn.  Philo deals with Joseph in quite a different way, and Sills discusses briefly scholarly solutions for the problem of this divergence. She suggests that Philo is especially interested in Joseph as statesman and politician. For this reason she draws attention to the historical treatise Flacc. in which Philo describes Flaccus’ fall frompower, exile, and death. Sills argues that Philo deals with the same theme in Flacc., Ios., and Somn. , namely the nature of political leadership. Flaccus is an example of a person who did not succeed as political leader, missing the three prerequisites Joseph did possess. (ACG) 9776. M.

Dixon Slingerland, Claudian Policymaking and the Early Imperial Repression of Judaism at Rome, South Florida Studies in the History of Judaism  (Atlanta ), esp. – and passim. This book on Claudius’ policymaking starts from the claim (made by Momi- gliano) that examination of Claudius in terms of his relationship with Jews and their religion provides privileged entry into the appreciation of his policy mak- ing as a whole. Of central importance in the study is the statement of Suetonius in Claudius . that ‘since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the insti- gation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from Rome’. The author argues that ‘Chrestus was neither Jesus nor any other suchmessianic figure, and, conse- quently, that the practically universal interpretatio christiana has taken Claudius . out of context. This study intends to restore the claim of Suetonius to vari- ous settings genuinely appropriate to it.’ A significant role in the investigation is played by Philo’s Legatio, besides Josephus, Acts of the Apostles, Dio Cas- sius, Orosius, and Eusebius’ Chronicle. Chapter  (pp. –) is entitled ‘Pre- Claudian Repression from between the Lines of the Jewish Sources’: the main source is here Philo’s Legatio, from which several passages are quoted (in trans- lation) and discussed. In the fourth chapter (pp. –), ‘Fundamental Reflec- tions of Claudian Policy making vis-à-vis Roman Jews and Judaism’, a central piece of evidence is Legat. –. The author concludes that, whereas mod- ern scholarship tends to draw the false conclusion that trouble-making Roman Jews were in great measure responsible for their own repeated difficulties, the available Gentile and Jewish sources show the regular object of governmental hostility to have been Jewish religiosity rather than any presupposed inclination to disorder or violence.

Philo is chosen as representative of the whole of Hellenistic Judaism, and his thought is analysed by means of three themes: Exodus, the life of Moses, and the Pascha. Philo’s interpretation of the Exodus account can be regarded as an alternative in comparison with those of the messianic movements, because the latter concentrate on the historical account, where Philo adds a moral and psychological aspect which falls outside the historical account. Nevertheless Stefani maintains that our philosopher does not reduce the letter of the Bible to ‘pure atemporal myth’, because he retains the belief in the specific nature of the history of the Jewish people.

Sterling first studies those texts in which Philo indicates what friendship is, with particular attention paid to Plant. –. Friendship is virtually identical with goodwill (εupsilonlenisacuteν ια), the Stoic definition of which he takes over. It is clear that Philo is well acquainted with the themes and vocabulary of hellenistic philosophical discussions on friendship. This is also seen in the fact that he takes over various topoi on the subject, e.g. on what the limits of friendship are when one is called upon to do something less that morally just in order to help a friend. Philo’s support for the rigid Stoic viewpoint here is perhaps prompted by polemic against Epicurean flexibility. A final theme is the boundaries of friendship, and here it is striking that Philo applies it both to fellow-Jews and to friendship with God. In fact Philo redefines friendship in religious terms; one’s friend is he who worships the true God. The bond of friendship is placed by nature in the heart of human beings, i.e. there is affinity ( 8κει της). In conclusion Sterling argues that Philo was attracted to the Stoic understanding of friendship because it balanced the claims of Jewish nationalism and exclusivism. The notion of friendship was thus wedded to a particular understanding of monotheism. It ‘became the vehicle for a Jewish universal understanding of the human race’ (p. ). (DTR) 9781. G. E.

Starting-point for this rich and learned article are the doctrinal controversies in the th century, in which attention is drawn to various prepositional phrases in the New Testament and their implications for Christology. But is this usage based on knowledge of the technical use of ‘prepositional metaphysics’ in Greek philosophy? Why is there so much inconsistency in their use? And in which way did this knowledge reach early Christian writers? In order to answer these </page> <page sequence="32">  part two questions the author first outlines the use of such prepositional phrases in Greek philosophy. Philo is a witness for their use in Middle Platonist thought (see pp. –). The variety of usage in the New Testament reflects a variety of schemes in Greek philosophy, with a basic divide between Stoic and Platonist formulations. Special attention is paid to the Christological hymn in Col :– , which contains a number of such phrases. It is suggested that this material entered the Jewish synagogue liturgy as a result of the attempt to present the doctrine in terms of philosophical categories and wisdom speculation. Philo’s use of such prepositional phrases for his doctrine of the Logos may have served as a basis for the development of several competing christologies in Alexandrian theology. Hellenistic Judaism thus played an important mediating role for Christian theology. (DTR) 9783. A. Terian, ‘Back to Creation: the Beginning of Philo’s Third Grand Commentary,’ in D. T. Runia and G.

Nikiprowetzky’s sweeping statement that Philo’s Allegorical Commentary and the Exposition of the Law are basically one grand commentary is an incen- tive to look once again at the relation betweenOpif. and Leg. and the proper place ofOpif. in the Philonic corpus. Moreover the question of the proper chronology or sequence of Philo’s various writings remains a fundamental issue that must be addressed before the chronology of thematic aspects of his thought can be estab- lished. Terian begins his detailed investigation with an examination of the evi- dence in Eusebius and the manuscript tradition. None of this material supports the placement ofOpif. at the beginning of the Allegorical Commentary. In fact in the manuscripts Opif. is always followed by one of the works of the Exposition. Next the internal evidence is taken into account, and esp. the cross-references to Opif. in Abr., Praem. and Mos. In the final part of the article Terian widens his focus somewhat and considers the aspect of development in Philo’s writings. He regards it as probable that there was a progression frommidrashic type com- mentaries to thematic expositions. But none of these considerations give us any freedom in the placement of Opif. It is locked in position as the opening treatise of the Exposition of the Law. (DTR) 9784. C.

The article first summarizes the ontological and cosmological ideas of Plato which became influential in Middle Platonism. The Greek Bible of the Jews has its own roots because it is orientated by wisdom. But in the concept of the Logos Jewish and Platonic–Stoic elements can be synthesized. This synthesis is realized in Philo, for whom the Logos is at the same time the Platonic Demiurge and the Model, as well as the Stoic governor of the world. The Philonic system of the divine powers is brought in relation to the mythological interpretations of the universal Logos as Hermes or Heracles in allegorists of the st century c.e., but with the NewTestament as well.The remainder of the article outlines the further development in the Valentinian gnosis and the Platonism of the nd century c.e. There, the supreme god thinks the ideas, the second god orders with their help the material world. A Platonic revival induces a series of three divine beings. (DZ) 9786. T. H.

Earlier Borgen (RRS ) and Mack (RRS ) have come to very different conclusions about that subject, Borgen emphasizing Philo’s messianic expecta- tions, Mack finding no messianic or apocalyptic features, but only mythology and wisdom tradition in the treatise. Tobin wants to locate the ‘eschatological’ texts from Praem. in the social and political contexts within which Philo wrote. To this end he considers Sibylline Oracles books  and . First comes an analysis of these two books. A significant trait of the books when considered chronolog- ically is the growing importance and ferocity of oracles against Rome; parallel to that, the deliverer figure shifts from being a worldly ruler (whether Cyrus or Ptolemy; cf. Isa :) to being a heavenly figure (cf. Num :,  LXX). The fact that the oracles were added to and reconfigured over a period of  years from the middle of the nd century b.c.e. onwards attests to their con- tinuing popularity among Egyptian Jews. Philo’s Praem., with its remarkable this-worldly eschatology in §§–, contains several parallels to Sib. Or.  and , notably the eschatological interpretation of Num : LXX (‘There shall </page> <page sequence="34">  part two come forth a man . . . ’, interpreted by Philo non-eschatologically inMos. .– ). Tobin argues that the eschatological passages in Praem. make much more sense when seen as significant revisions of viewpoints found in Sib. Or.  and . He concludes that () Philo, like most Jews of his time, does have eschatological expectations; () Philo has thoroughly revised the kind of eschatology found in much of the Jewish Sibylline tradition; () themost obvious reason for this is that he saw in the violent denunciations of Gentile peoples and especially the Roman empire in the Jewish Sibylline tradition a danger to the existence and well-being of the Jewish community of Alexandria, Egypt and elsewhere.

After having first recognized that the subject of prayer is rather diffuse in Philo, the author attempts to establish its salient characteristics, making reference to texts taken from the entire Philonic corpus. On the basis of this material he finds three types of prayer: () those of biblical personages; () those prescribed by scripture; () personal prayers of the soul of every human being. (RR) 9788. N.

We list here only those which focus on Hellenistic Judaism. ‘Frühe Begegnung zwischen jüdischem Glauben und hel- lenistischer Bildung in Alexandrien’ (pp. –, first published in ) presents a survey on the Jewish authors before Philo who appropriate Greek thinking or Greek forms of culture.

In ‘„Hellenistische Eschatologie“ im Frühjudentum—ein Beitrag zur „Biblis- chen Theologie“?’ (pp. –, first published in ) Walter establishes a Jewish-Hellenistic type of eschatology which is oriented to a timeless salva- tion already prepared in heaven, in principle accessible to all mankind and exemplified inter alia by the concept of God’s eternity in Philo and in the SlavonicEnoch. ‘Kannman als Jude auchGrieche sein? Erwägungen zur jüdisch- hellenistischen Pseudepigraphie’ (pp. –, published in the Festschrift Ben Zion Wacholder in ) gives an evaluation of Jewish writings under the name of Greek authors, most of whom want to show to their Jewish readers how congenial Judaism is with its Hellenistic environment, an aspiration which in the long run failed.

B.W.Winter,Philo and Paul among the Sophists, Society ofNew Testament Studies Monograph Series  (Cambridge ), esp. –. The first half of the monograph, based on a  Macquarie University Syd- ney dissertation (see RRS ), focuses on Alexandria, the second half on Corinth. In both cases, the author argues, we should take references to the exis- tence of practising sophists seriously. The beginnings of the second sophistic movement are thus earlier than is generally thought. The first chapter of the Alexandrian section examines POxy , a letter from a young student to his father complaining about the educational situation, the second to Dio Chrysos- tom’s Alexandrian oration (p. ). Three chapters are devoted to Philo. In the first the Philonic texts mentioning sophists are analysed. Winter urges us to take these references literally, i.e. as referring to actual educators working in Philo’s city. Specific texts discussed areContempl. ,Agr. ,QG .,Congr. ,Opif. . In the second chapter it is argued that Philo does not polemicize against the educational ethos of the Greek paideia, but against its misuse by the ora- tors and sophists of his day. The terms in which this critique is formulated are clearly indebted to Plato. Sophists misuse paideia for vice, deception and per- sonal gain. The third chapter shows how Philo himself, as orator and debater, enters into debate with the sophists and defeats them. In conclusion Philo’s expe- riences are compared with those of another Hellenized Jew, Caecilius of Calacte. Reviews: Anonymous, Irén  () ; F. G. Downing, JThS  () – ; A. J.

Shea (Berrien Springs Mich.) –. </page> <page sequence="36">  part two Observing that Philo, Josephus, and Paul all wrote in Greek during the first century c.e., Young examines how the three understood the καταλλαγ- word group (i.e. words pertaining to reconciliation). Usage is classified according to four categories, adopted from I. H. Marshall: reconciliation between two parties effected by a third-party mediator (‘reconciliation bymediation’), reconciliation initiated by one of two affected parties (‘reconciliation by initiative’), reconcili- ation whereby one party gives up anger and forgives the other (‘reconciliation by forgiveness’), and reconciliation whereby one party removes the cause of the problem from and forgives the other party (‘reconciliation by forgiving and removing’). Philo and Josephus speak of reconciliation in ways that fall into the first three categories, but only Paul speaks of reconciliation by forgiving and removing, thereby expanding the sense of the word-group. The prime exam- ple of this unique usage is Cor :–, in which God reconciles sinners to Himself through forgiveness and removal of their sin. (EB) 9792. D. Zeller, ‘Philons spiritualisierende Eschatologie und ihre Nachwirkung bei den Kirchenvätern,’ in E. Goodman-Thau (ed.), Vom Jenseits. Jüdisches Denken in der europäischen Geistesgeschichte (Berlin ) –. In Philo’s literal exposition the biblical promise of a long life is expanded to immortality, albeit only of the soul. The anthropological foundations for this are found in Plato: the imperishability of the soul ensures immortality for man if the spiritual element is made dominant in his life. Death then means returning to the soul’s origin, i.e. to God. Typical for Philo is the actualization and the religious interpretation of ‘life’ and ‘death’ in his allegorical commentary, analysed by the author in his article ‘The Life and Death of the Soul in Philo of Alexandria’ (= RRS ). Zeller then goes on to show the continuing influence of this conception, as can be recognized by exegetical devices in Christian fathers. Clement of Alexandria, like Philo, combines Deut : f. with v. , thus defining life as virtue and sin as death (Paed. .., dependent on Philo). The influence of Philo is also perceptible inOrigen’s’ interpretation ofNum: and Gen :, but now faith in Christ constitutes the criterion of life. Ambrose, esp. in his exposition of the Paradise-story, transports Philonic ideas to theWest, where he is echoed by Augustine. However, the latter’s polemics against ‘some’ who apply Gen : to the death of the soul do not aim at Philo, but rather at the Pelagians. On the whole, the Church fathers resist a complete spiritualization of death and life. (DZ) </page> <page sequence="37">  . D. H. Akenson, Surpassing Wonder: the Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds (Montreal ), esp. –. The author considers the Bible and later literature based on it as inventions of three sets of texts and their faiths: ancient YHWH faith, or ‘Judahism’; the modern Jewish faith, also called Rabbinic or Talmudic Judaism; and the Chris- tian faith, which developed out of Jesus-faith. Philo is included in a survey of the richly diverse manifestations of Judahism in the Second Temple period. Although, according to Akenson, Philo is relatively—and unjustly—ignored in discussions of the pre- c.e. period, he provides an excellent example of ‘a highly-devout diaspora Judahist’ (p. ), fully conversant with the contempo- rary Greek philosophical writings, who points in several ways to elements in future Jewish and Christian religions. In this regard, Akenson finds especially significant the question–and–answer form used by Philo and found in later rab- binic literature; Philo’s allegorization of the Temple; the Logos concept, reflected later in the Gospel of John; Philo’s emphasis on Moses as mediator between the Logos andGod’s people; and, finally, Philo’s thinking in ‘types,’ an approach used by later Christians (pp. –).

After some initial remarks on Philo’s method of allegoresis and some recent interpretations by scholars such as Hamerton-Kelly, Dawson, Hay and Dillon, the author presents a close reading of Abr. –, paying particular attention to the structural and rhetorical features of the passage. It is concluded that ‘allegory is . . . a rhetorical instrument that can be used as an exegetical technique as well as a persuasive argumentative tool’ (). (DTR) 9803.

The author examines the relationship between early Christian apologet- ics and Hellenistic-Jewish apologetics. In response to accusations of atheism, the first Christian apologists present monotheism in terms that resemble those of Philo’s Opif. –. Their polemics against polytheism and idola- try make use of the hierarchy of kinds of paganism elaborated by Philo ear- lier in Spec. .–, Decal. –, Contempl. –. In responding to accusa- tions of incest, ritual murder and misanthropy, the apologists praise Christian ethics and condemn pagan customs, taking their inspiration from Hellenistic- Jewish apologetics and notably from Philo. The same applies to their response </page> <page sequence="38">  part two to the accusation of novelty.

Lévy (ed.), Philon d’Alexandrie et le langage de la philosophie, Monothéismes et Philosophie (Turnhout ) –. A study of Virt. – on μετ ν ια and – on εupsilonlenisγ νεια, in which the author intends to demonstrate how Philo’s discourse, while using philo- sophical themes and vocabulary, is of a religious nature and embedded in an historic context. The author analyses first the ‘problematique, thèmes et lexique philosophiques’ (pp. –) as well as the ‘cohérence religieuse’ (–) of the section on μετ ν ια; the same twofold analysis (philosophical –, religious –) is then applied to the section on εupsilonlenisγ νεια. In Platonic and Stoic philoso- phy μετ ν ια (repentance, conversion) is mainly disqualified—the wise person should not repent. Philo, however, affirms the sinfulness of man, and the wis- dom of the person who returns from his idle ways. The interpretation of μετ - ν ια strikes Platonic and Stoic notes, but fails to show the coherence of a philo- sophical system (pace A. Michel, RRS ). By contrast, the author stresses the religious coherence of Philo’s discourse on μετ ν ια.The biblical motif of return to God is here of central importance (where the Septuagint mainly uses the verb 'πιστρ  ειν, Philo prefers μεταν ε(ν, μετ ν ια), as is the concept of the πρ σ-  λυτ ς (Philo often prefers to use the term 'π λυτ ς). In the final part of Virt. devoted to the virtue of εupsilonlenisγ νεια (nobility) Philo again can be found speaking in Platonic and Stoic terms, but Alexandre once more argues that the passage develops a religious argument, which is in tune with Philo’s historical context. The heart of Philo’s exposition, it is argued, is a reflection on the contemporary spiritual situation of proselytes and apostates. (HMK) 9805. R.

Arnal- dez focuses on Cain, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Hagar and Ishmael. All of these figures in their lives express a particular attitude towards themselves, towards the other, and towards God. It is concluded that in Philo we find Pla- tonic and Stoic as well as Epicurean vocabulary. But Philo’s main allegiance is to the Law of Moses, and his first interest is human life in all its complexity, for which philosophical ideas may serve as instruments of reflection.

The author argues that Philo’s writings belong to a different world when comparedwith the classic Jewish commentaries on theBible. An attempt ismade to explain this irreducibility, which is due to purely objective reasons caused by the use of Greek in the commentary on a text translated from Hebrew into Greek. In order to measure the extent to which this linguistic factor determines the differences between a Philonic commentary and a text such as the Midrash Rabbah, one needs to take into account the Hebrew text of the Bible, the Hebrew Mishnaic commentary, the Greek text of the Septuagint, which is already a kind of commentary, and the commentary in Greek produced by Philo. The data yielded by these comparisons is analysed from various points of view: the relation between signifiers, the quest for unity and coherence, and the pressure exerted by other literary corpora, namely the Greek pagan literature adduced in the case of Philo and the tradition of the oral Law in the case of the rabbis of the Midrash.

Barclay compares Paul and Philo with regard to their view on circumci- sion. In Spec. .– Philo lists six reasons for the custom of circumcision, ending with two allegorical explanations: circumcision is a symbol of cutting away the pleasures; further, it denotes the excising of the idea that human beings are able to generate on their own. Despite these allegorical interpre- tations, Philo does not reject the literal practice. In Migr. – he offers the same allegorical explanations, but at the same time he emphasizes that the literal observance should be maintained, because he wants to avoid the censure of the masses and their accusations (Migr. ). Having analysed the Philonic texts, Barclay discusses Rom :–, where Paul argues that the only circumcision that matters is the circumcision of the heart. In contrast to Philo, Paul is not concerned about the opinion of the masses.

According to Gregory Eunomius presents God’s dynamis as separate from God himself, being independent and possessing creative power. To Gregory this separation seems to be Philonic and based on material in Philo’s writings. Against this view he argues that a productive capacity is nat- ural to God, and that God’s transcendence includes the capacity to create. (ACG) 9810. A. Baumgarten, ‘Graeco-Roman Voluntary Associations and Ancient Jewish Sects,’ in M. Goodman (ed.), Jews in a Graeco-Roman World (Oxford ) –. In the Greco-Roman world there was a large variety of voluntary associations such as guilds, clubs and cult fellowships, of which people chose to bemembers. A major feature of these groups was that they ate together. At the same time Judaism in the Second Temple period was marked by a number of important sects, such as the Essenes and Pharisees. These two blocks of social organiza- tion were brought in relation to each other by both Philo and Josephus when describing the Jewish sects, apparently in the hope that the Greco-Roman vari- eties would illumine the Jewish examples because they were better known to their Greek readers. In his paper Baumgarten concentrates on the account that Philo and Josephus give of the Essenes (no mention is made of the Therapeu- tae), focusing above all on issues such as what food they ate, with whom, how often, and under what conditions. He ends by suggesting that the popularity of these sects in the Second Temple period may have something to do with urban alienation. (DTR) 9811. G.

The aim of the article is to elucidate a highly pertinent topic for Philonic studies, namely the importance of the philosophical background against which Philo’s thought is elaborated. The continuity of this background is particularly evident in the case of Platonism. It allows us, even though our explicitly philo- sophical sources are scanty, to trace the course of the exegesis of Plato’s dialogues. In order to study one thread of this strand of development, the author focuses </page> <page sequence="41"> critical studies   on the case of the Timaeus and its doctrines on the genesis of the cosmos in the interpretation of Philo, Plutarch and Atticus.

Bekken, The Word is Near You: a Study of Deuteronomy :– in Paul’s Letter to the Romans against the Background of Philo’s Exposition in De Virtutibus and De Praemiis et Poenis (diss. University of Trondheim ). In this Norwegian dissertation supervised by P. Borgen the author suggests that Paul’s interpretative rendering of Deut :– represents a sample of the conventional exegetical paraphrase of a biblical text. In such exegesis words, phrases and sentences from the OT are either omitted, repeated or replaced by interpretative terms and fused together and supplemented with other qualifying terms. Paul’s treatment of Deut :– can thus be placed within the literary conventions of his day, of which Praem – and Virt – represent important examples. Hence Paul’s treatment of Deut :– should not be considered an idiosyncratic creation by himself. After a brief review of research, and some literary observations on the surface level of the texts selected, Bekken further argues his thesis by in-depth studies of Virt. – (Chap. ), Praem. – (Chap. ), Rom. :– in its literary and Jewish Context (Chap. ), followed by a final summary.

The first part of the essay surveys discussion of dreams in such writers as Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Stoic thinkers, Artemidorus, and Asclepius, showing varying assessments of the ‘prophetic and divinatory significance’ of dreams. Oneiro- critical writings contain classification of and theories about different types of dreams, elements of which can be found in Philo’s Somn.These elements include technical terms, topics, symbols, and theory. Claiming that Philo used the oneirocritical tradition to underscore the divine source, the character, and the prophetic and philosophical significance of dreams recorded in the Pentateuch, Berchman encourages further study of this tradition for a better understand- ing of Philo’s approach.

During recent decades the revival of the discussion of the identity of the Qumran community has led to a renewed interest in the descriptions of the Essenes in Philo and Josephus. Bilde emphasizes that the old scholarly opinion of the Dead Sea Scrolls as being rather untouched by the Hellenistic culture, in contrast to Philo and Josephus, is no longer tenable. Hence his aim in this article is to provide a renewed discussion of the accounts of Philo and Josephus in light of recent discussions of the Qumran community’s identity and early history. After a lengthy presentation of similarities and differences between Philo’s and Josephus’ presentations of the Essenes (pp. –), including the Therapeutae, Bilde offers some interesting conclusions. He finds that Philo and Josephus present the same general picture of the Essenes, namely that of an admirable voluntary association of pious and virtuous men. Furthermore, their descriptions are based on traditional material, that is on one or more, possibly written sources. The Therapeutae are to be understood as a Diaspora group closely related to the Essenes. Finally, we should not consider Philo’s and Josephus’ accounts as ‘Hellenized distortions’ of the historical reality found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but the two groups of writings represent two different types </page> <page sequence="43"> critical studies   of Hellenization, as well as being different literary genres. Hence the accounts in Philo and Josephus should be regarded as relevant sources to the Essenes/the Qumranites even where they do not verbatim correspond to the Dead Sea Scrolls. (TS) 9817. A.

In his rational apologetics for the usage Philo depends on Jewish, but also Egyptian predecessors. His favoured symbolic interpretation is held in common with the radical allegorists opposed inMigr. –. Nowhere is circumcision considered to be a sign of the covenant.

Bock, Blasphemy and Exaltation in Judaism and the Final Examination of Jesus, Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament . (Tübingen ), esp. –, –. In order to illustrate the charge of blasphemy in Mark :– the author collects testimonies on blasphemy in Judaism. In Philo the Greek term  λα- σ ημ- shows a wide range of meaning from secular use to evil speech directed against God. It is not connected with the use of a specific term for God, but it appears inMos. .– that the fact the one uses the Name ‘unseasonably’ is worthy of death, which is close to the rabbinic position. Three of the four texts discussing blasphemy refer to cases where a human being is claiming divine- like authority (though Bock sees in Decal. ff. an attack on the ruler-cult). An example where ‘divinity’ is attributed to an human being, is Moses. But this is the way that Philo describes how Moses becomes a vessel for divine revelation (p. ). On p.  f. the Philonic passages are shown to be important for the evaluation of Jesus’ claim to share divine authority. (DZ) </page> <page sequence="44">  part two 9820. H. K. Bond, Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation, Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series  (Cambridge ), esp. –. The aim of the monograph is to present the first full-length academic treat- ment of the famous governor of Judea, concentrating especially on an examina- tion of how this real historical figure was used by various Jewish and Christian authors of the st century c.e. The first chapter is devoted to Philo, who is the first literary author to refer to Pilate. Philo’s harsh description of Pilate’s charac- ter and motivation in the incident of the shields stems largely from his political rhetoric, in which he tries to prevent the new emperor Claudius from adopt- ing his predecessor’s attitude to the Jews, and from his theology, in which the enemies of Judaism are portrayed as the enemies of God. Behind the theological gloss, however, the historical Pilate is just visible. Philo’s presentation of the facts seems trustworthy. (DTR) 9821. P.

Snyder (Harrisburg Pa. ) –. The author first describes the hermeneutical insight that Philo can interpret one and the same biblical text on two or three different levels, that is on the concrete and specific level, on the level of cosmic and general principles, and on the level of the divine realm of the beyond. Then he sets out to illustrate Philo’s two-level exegesis of Exod :–:. This he carries out by an investigation of Mos. .–, .–, Contempl. – and Ebr. . In the first two texts he finds that Philo illustrates Moses’ role as king and prophet, in the Contempl. – he finds a typological and liturgical interpretation of the biblical event, a kind of liturgical re-enactment in the present. In the last text he argues that Philo presents a cultural application which is applied to the life of the Jews in their pagan cultural context. (TS) 9822. P.

In this article Borgen investigates some of the various views and activities of the Jews and early Christians related to proselytism and mission. Accord- ing to his findings the sources demonstrate that some Gentiles became pros- elytes to Judaism because of attraction. In other cases Jews actively presented their religion in Gentile circles and even at times used military force to bring people into the Jewish religion. These various approaches were applied both to individuals as well as to collective groups; they were seen as being at work both in past and present history, and they were also part of the future eschatolog- </page> <page sequence="45"> critical studies   ical scenarios. Although the Christian mission did have some distinctive fea- tures, its matrix was the Jewish notions of proselytism, eschatology and con- quest. Borgen further argues that according to Philo the conversion of Gen- tiles to Judaism consisted of three aspects: religious conversion, ethical con- version, and social conversion. Concerning Christian mission in the New Tes- tament he finds that it is rooted in Jewish ideas and methods of proselytism, but these are recast on the basis of the motif of eschatology and conquest. Hence Philo’s ideas about proselytes offer a strikingly apposite background with the threefold understanding of conversion, as Borgen finds that also Christian mission consisted of these three aspects. There are, however, differences: while Jewish proselytism brought Gentile converts into the Jewish nation, Christian mission brought these into a cross-national community of Jews and Gentiles.

Sanders (edd.),TheFunction of Scripture in Early Jewish and Christian Tradition (Sheffield ) – . The author discusses different views of the narrative of Abraham and Sarah, including Philo’s interpretation. For Philo Abraham’s journey is the journey of the soul who leaves the material world and strives for purification. Sarah is a symbol of virtue and Abraham, the virtue-loving mind, can call her his sister because this name indicates the common love of all who desire excellence (QG .). According to Borgman, Philo’s ‘drama of the soul’s journey helps to illumine the story of Abraham’ (p. ). (ACG) 9824. A. P.

The author argues that, although Philo certainly presents his Mosaic phi- losophy in terms of Platonism, in actual fact a number of its distinctive doc- trines have an Aristotelian origin. This applies above all to the doctrine of the divine Powers, which turns on the distinction between God-as-he-is and God- turned-to-the-world. The closest parallel for this doctrine is found in the Aris- totelian writing De mundo, which may have been Philo’s source. InOpif.  Philo does not polemicize against Aristotle, but against the erroneous theology of the Chaldeans. In Opif.  the doctrine of two causes is closer to Aristotle than Plato. The image of the magnet, also derived from the De mundo, is used by Philo in various contexts in connection with God’s powers, the cosmos and the soul. In the final part of the article Bos gives an evaluation of Philo’s doctrines of the Powers and suggests that the final words of Opif.  should be read as allud- ing to Plato via the final quotation of the De mundo. He concludes (p. ): ‘ . . . whenever we encounter statements about ‘Philo’s Platonism’, we will do well to remember the words of the blind seer Isaac: ‘the voice is the voice of Plato, but the philosophy is the philosophy of Aristotle’.’ (DTR) </page> <page sequence="46">  part two 9825.

It is when he is dealing with the divisions of the soul—whether binary (Congr. ), tripartite (Leg. .) or other divisions (Mut. –, Abr. –)—that Philo demonstrates most completely his competence in Greek philosophical doctrine.He thus furnishes his readerswith knowledge of the human soul, which is not in the first place physiological or ‘anatomical’. It is rather the key element of a ‘soteriology’, as appears from the presence of a most influential metaphor in ancient thought, the clothes of the soul (cf. QG ., Deus , Leg. .– ,  and ). From a study of this metaphor it emerges that the Alexandrian is able to integrate diverse elements of Greek nomenclature and imagery in an anthropology and soteriology which remains faithful at a deep level to the teaching which he read in scripture. (JR) 9826. D. Bradshaw, ‘The Vision of God in Philo of Alexandria,’ American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly  () –. Although Philo is not always held in high regard as a philosopher, his under- standing of the vision of God is well worth studying for the way in which he understands the Bible in Platonic terms, while bringing Platonic concepts together with the notion of a personal God. One prepares oneself to see God by living a virtuous life through obedience to the Law. Such behaviour leads to the Platonic goal of assimilating oneself to God; unlike the Greek Fathers, however, Philo does not see this as a process of deification. Philo distinguishes between divine essence and existence, claiming only the latter can be known. Nonetheless Bradshaw argues that God’s essence has a personal dimension, the pursuit of which constantly draws the seeker, and that God’s existence can be felt as a personal presence. In Philo’s thought, therefore, vision of God is more than a rational apprehension of divine existence; it is a personal encounter. (EB) 9827. S. A. Brayford, The Taming and Shaming of Sarah in the Septuagint of Genesis, (diss. Iliff School of Theology and University of Denver ). It is argued that Sarah’s shameful portrayal in the Septuagint served as amodel for subsequent Hellenistic retellings of her stories. Unlike other scholars who credit Philo and Josephus with Sarah’s domestication, the author endeavours to show that they merely continued the Hellenization process already started in the LXX.

The first section of the paper attempts to place early Alexandrian Christianity in its historical context. It is likely that it grew out of the kind of ‘school environment’ found in Alexandrian Hellenistic Judaism and described by Philo. Some brief remarks are also devoted to the debt of Alexandrian Christianity to Philonic ideas. (DTR) 9829. G.

After some examples of modern interpretation and a short analysis of the biblical text the author presents three ancient Jewish understandings of the naming of the animals: Jubilees , Josephus, Ant. . and Philo, Opif. – . Whereas in the first two authors the encounter with the animals reveals to the first man his sexual need, in Philo he is a perfect being. His name-giving reveals his intuitive wisdom and his royal position over against the animal world. This interpretation is found again in Johann Gottfried Herder, but does not correspond to a concept held in theAncientNear East, asmodern commentators like to think. (DZ) 9830. F.

In this translation of the Italian original (see following item), Calabi devotes two chapters to examining the relationship between how the Law is interpreted and how it is applied and a third chapter to discussion of the principles of Philonic exegesis, with some reference to Greek commentaries and rabbinic literature.

The chief theme of thismonograph is the role of the Law in Philo, investigated by focusing on three fundamental questions: () the transmission of the Law from God to humankind; () the extent of and practical application of the Law; () the interpretation of the Law. To each of these questions a chapter of the study is devoted. ()The first theme centres on the figure of Moses in his roles as prophet, interpreter and lawgiver. If Moses is passive, however, in his reception </page> <page sequence="48">  part two of the divine message, does he still have an active role? In fact both conditions occur: as prophet the passive role predominates, as interpreter and lawgiver the active. But the process of mediation from God to humankind through Moses also involved an ontological leap, a shift from the spiritual to the material realm. For this reason the figure of Aaron is introduced. It is also emphasized that the translation of the LXX is strictly analogous to the transmission of the text via Moses. () The biblical Laws do not have an exclusively ethical or political role, but propagate a state of order and harmony which applies both to the cosmos and to the human realm. In the former no transgression is possible, in the latter it is. The author discusses how this is in the context of creation. For Philo’s political thought it is essential to recognize that the first founder of the state is actually external to the state, i.e. God. This means that ethics is superior to politics. Differently than in Plato, however, the goal of political legislation cannot be the felicity of the polis, but rather the realization of a cosmic and human order. () The process of the transmission of the Law is continued in human exegetical activity. The riches of the biblical text admit a plurality of interpretations, a characteristic which makes the Torah different to what occurs in philosophical texts. This plurality allows different levels of interpretation and authority, from the text itself which cannot be changed to the opinion of philosophers which are fully disputable. Calabi emphasizes two further aspects of the biblical record. Firstly, no reference ismade to non-written traditions, because scripture contains the whole of what is revealed (but it then has to be interpreted). Secondly the entire Torah is unitary and uniform; no one part is more or less important than the other. The final part of this chapter gives examples of biblical interpretation based primarily onMut. The main question discussed is how God, who is essentially unknowable, can still be known in some ways at the human level. Reviews: M. Hadas-Lebel, REJ  () ; A.

The notion of the biblical sanctuary expressed in Exod :, which calls for building a sanctuary so that God ‘may dwell among’ the Israelites, poses a challenge to philosophical principles. Surveying classical and modern thinkers, Canale shows that the philosophical approach, including that of Philo (pp. – ), requires a metaphorical understanding of the building. This is because from the philosophical perspective, God is either timeless or spaceless, and the sanctuary building exists in both time and space. Canale suggests taking a pre- scientific Biblical approach based upon Exod :–, which would allow for a view of God that is compatible with time and space and would thereby also allow for a literal understanding of the sanctuary.

So the names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their predecessors supply the key to the Philonic (allegorical) code. Without Hebrew of these names, the author argues, the entire Philonic system would collapse like a house of cards. This remark puts us on the track of allegorical exegesis and in the rest of the article various passages are analysed: Sobr. b–; Somn. .–; Deus –; Leg. .–. (JR) 9834. J.

Philo, discussed on pp. – , exemplifies a prominent writer from antiquity who saw philosophical— especially Platonic—notions in the LXX creation account, and Philo influenced a number of later thinkers. The textual features of the LXX, in which Philo and others saw indications of philosophical concepts, can be explained in other ways, however, and do not necessarily indicate the influence of Greek thought.

At stake is here the relation between Reason and Revelation. At the end of her article Crepaldi argues that the subjugation of Reason to Faith betrays a misunderstanding of this relation: the two domains should be considered as heterogeneous, mutually irreducible and of equal dignity. The relationship between them is one of dialogue. (HMK) 9836. E. Dassmann et al., Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, Band XVIII (Stuttgart ). R. Turcan, Art.

In this complicated article (the major part of which consists of extensive notes), an important role is played by the th century scholar Justus Lipsius. He appears to have been the first to draw attention to Philo’s Stoicism, as compared with the widespread opinion concerning his Platonism. Philo’s relationship with Stoicism is problematic, it is true, and there definitely is a distance between his allegorisation and that of the Stoics. Lipsius notably referred to Philo’s treatise Aet. The author, agreeing with D. T. Runia R-R  on this point, discerns an Aristotelian   σις (the world as ungenerated and indestructible) in this treatise, which Philo refutes as being atheistic with the help of Stoic arguments. The author discusses in particular Lipsius’ translation of Aet. . But as regards atheism (or impiety), does this not paradoxically enough apply to the Stoics as well? To answer this question the author draws attention to the theory of natural places (hence the paper’s title) and the use made of it by Philo, precisely because it is on the cornerstones of the edifice of Aristotelian teleology (p. ). The author then focuses on Philo’s argumentation in Prov. .–—a text unknown to Lipsius—in which Peripatetic arguments are once again countered with Stoic ones. An excursus elaborates Lipsius’ thesis of Philo’s Stoicism in contrast to his Platonism, and describes the ensuing discussion about the characterization of Philo’s philosophy from Lipsius’ own time onwards to the th century.

The term  ιλαυτ α does not originate with Philo, but he does use it rather frequently. For this usage he is indebted to Plato and Aristotle, but he adds to the reflection of his predecessors the inspiration of his Jewish convictions, as the author shows in discussing the more important Philonic texts on this subject, which concentrate on two major figures, Cain and Pharaoh (Det. , , , Sacr. , Conf. , Post. , Leg. ., Cher. ). As negation of the God and the Beautiful, philautia above all focuses on leisure and pleasure. In regarding himself as the cause of all things, the philautos pursues every path of unreason, illustrating the confrontation of the sensible and the intelligible. When philautia holds someone in its grip, the person flees towards the passions and so distances himself from God. (JR) 9841. J. Dillon, ‘Asômatos: Nuances of Incorporeality in Philo,’ in C.

This can be seen as a piece of muddle-headedness, and as a compromise with Stoic materialism, but it can also—more profitably in my view—be seen as an indication that the boundary between the corporeal and the incorporeal was not drawn by many ancient thinkers where we might think it should be drawn.’ (HMK) 9842.

There is an influence of Heraclitus on Philo which can be called ‘concealed’, in the sense that it is not reducible to the fundamental concept of the Logos and the views on it that the Alexandrian received from Heraclitus through the intermediation of the Stoa. This influence is encountered in the general theory of opposites which in Philo characterizes the figure of Moses. Moses is seen as an example of an equilibrium between the opposites. But in the treatise on his life these opposites taken together are multiple, and for this reason the mediating function of Moses is multiple as well. On the one hand he represents the equilibrium between doctrine and life (logos and bios). On the other hand the same Moses becomes the intermediary between God and man (p. ). There can be no doubt, therefore, that the philosophy of Heraclitus is very much present in the treatise Mos. (RR) 9846. E. S.

In the portraits which he sketches of the Roman emperors in Flacc. and Legat., Philo uses a terminology, inspired by Greek philosophy, which was an integral part of his cultural heritage. But it should not be thought that he merely uses it for purposes of flattery or when his Jewish culture is no longer capable of supplying what he wishes to express. In this regard his usage of the theme of the king-shepherd, present both in the Old Testament and in Greek literature, is illuminating (cf. Ios. , Prob. ). Philo’s consistent inclination to draw on Greek culture can be explained by the fact that certain ideas developed in political philosophy were close to his own. This is what happens with the ideal of the king as living law (Mos. .), which the Alexandrian understands as the accommodation of the will of the king to the Law, which in his eyes is the Law of Moses (cf. Spec. .–). In short, emphasizing the role of philosophy in the portrait of the emperors amounts to emphasizing the role of the Law and of the Jewish people who were attached to that Law. Philo thus makes himself the advocate of Judaism for an enlightened Roman public. (JR) 9848. L.

Dio defends the efforts to depict the invisible, because of the human need to have the Divine nearby in the form of visible and tangible symbols by statues and temples. Philo, on the other hand, ridicules the idols, but at the same time recognizes a similar desire to approach and converse with the Divine. For Philo, since sacrifices can only be offered in the one temple, this desire is met by prayer as a major virtue, and by living according to the Law. (TS) 9849. D. M.

Hay suggests that Philomay not have agreed with all the values of the group such as celibacy, equality of the sexes, renunciation of property, and avoidance of slav- ery.Details one can glean about theTherapeutae include their life away fromcity, plain diet, use of sexual imagery for spiritual experience, preference for allegor- ical interpretation, and celebration of a fiftieth day festival which culminated in a song of thanksgiving. One can only guess why Philo is silent about so many aspects of the group. His purposes in this work may have included extolling the virtue of contemplation and showing the superiority to pagan ways of Judaism, as practised by this community.

Hillar, ‘The Logos and its Function in theWritings of Philo of Alexandria: Greek Interpretation ofHebrewThought and Foundations of Christianity. Part One,’ A Journal from the Radical Reformation  () –. In using Greek philosophical concepts, like the Logos, to explain the bibli- cal account, Philo laid the groundwork for later Christian philosophical and theological doctrines. The ‘Logos’ idea had been found in both Greek philos- ophy and Jewish thought. In Philo’s usage the Logos ‘changed from a metaphys- ical entity into an extension of the divine and transcendental anthropomor- phic being and a mediator between God and men.’ Hillar characterizes Philo’s descriptions of the Logos and its functions as follows: () utterance of God, whereby God’s words and actions are the same; () divine Mind, which encom- passes God’s thought and powers, identified with Plato’s notion of intelligible forms; () agent of Creation, whereby the Logos creates matter based upon God’s eternal creation of the intelligible world; () transcendent power, which unites the two divine powers (referred to by Philo in different ways); and () universal bond, which binds together and administers all parts of the universe.

The Hebrew translation of Philo, commenced in , is making good prog- ress, but poses a number of problems which the author attempts to resolve by examining the following questions: () would the Hebrew language, as known and practised in Philo’s time, been able to accommodate the expression of his thought? () would Philo have been able to express himself in Hebrew if he had wanted to do so? () did he have access to writings which in his time were only available in Hebrew? The author answers these questions and also gives some examples of problematic terms. (JR) 9853. J.-G.

A stimulating survey of Philo’s thoughts on political involvement and political ideals. Philo does not believe in the ivory tower of contemplation but insists that the philosopher take up the active life when necessary. Moreover contemplation is presented as best practised in a collective context, as for example in the case of the Therapeutae. When Philo pronounces on political ideals, he has to take various audiences into account, and it may well be that his personal meaning is concealed. This can be sensed in his interpretations of the figures of Joseph and Jethro. The article ends with a brief account of Philo’s views on slavery, which are remarkable on account of their anticipation of abolitionism. (DS) 9854. A. Kamesar, ‘Philo, the Presence of ‘Paideutic’ Myth in the Pentateuch, and the ‘Principles’ or Kephalaia of Mosaic Discourse,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. For Philo it is axiomatic that Moses rejected the use of myth and that the Pentateuch is a non-mythical work. Generally Philo explains away apparently mythical elements by allegorizing them. But Kamesar points out that there are some texts in Philo where myth seems to have a paedeutic purpose. A key text in this regard is Deus –, in which he sets out two Mosaic principles of discourse. It is shown that attempts to pin down what Philo exactly means by these principles have not been very successful. The background of these principles seems to be a literalistic form of exegesis, which Philo faithfully records, but is not in accordance with his preferred method of reading the Bible. But where does this theory of the two principles come from? Kamesar rejects the view that it has semitic or rabbinic roots. A much better parallel is found in the literary theorist Hermogenes. This confirms that it is more likely that the principles have a literalist background. They are both meant to be taken at a literary level, but refer to two different modes of expression of the biblical text. The ‘mythical’ mode, however, is not meant for purposes of delectation, as in </page> <page sequence="56">  part two Greek theory. Philo prefers a purely ‘didacticist’ interpretation of its usefulness. The article concludes that Philo’s position is made up of a mixture of elements. He is prepared to support the use of ‘paedeutic’ myth, but this does not cohere so well with his employment of allegory for the ‘healing’ ofmyth.TheNeoplatonists with their distinction between paedeutic and inspired myth were able to put forward a more consistent theory.

The Jewswho, after the conquests of Alexander theGreat,migrated toAlexan- dria, adjusted well to the new environment. New Jewish concepts arose during this period, some of which were influenced by Greek thought, including the division between body and soul, immortality, resurrection, angels and demons, and the development of the messianic idea. Philo’s ideas are used to illustrate this development, e.g. in his allegorical interpretations, his distinction between the world of perception (sense) and conception (intellect), the transcendence of God and the divine Logos, and notions—found also in Proverbs and Rabbinic Midrashim—about wisdom and creation. (EB) 9856. J. J. Kanagaraj, ‘Mysticism’ in the Gospel of John: an Inquiry into its Background, JSNT.S  (Sheffield ), esp. –. It is the thesis of this study that the Gospel of John, even its mysticism, should be interpreted against a Palestinian Jewish background. Important in this background is the so-calledMerkabahmysticism: the author finds that John, being a Palestinian Jewish Christian, polemicizes against theMerkabah mystical practice prevalent at that time. To substantiate his thesis, he traverses several works related to Hellenistic mysticism, including Philo (pp. –), Palestinian mysticism in the Hekhalot literature, evidence of Merkabah mysticism in pre- Christian writings, in the Christian era, in apocalyptic literature, in the Yohanan ben Zakkai tradition, and the influence of key passages from Scripture (Ezek , Isa  andDan ), building up a list of  aspects ofMerkabah mysticism. Against this background he investigates seven motifs of the Gospel of John: ascent, glory, king, sending, indwelling, light and the logos. For all these, however, he finds that the conceptual and phraseological parallels with Hellenistic mysticism and Philo’s ‘mystical’ teachings are very slender. For example, the eschatological aspect of seeing is not found in Philo’s writings, and it is less probable that John was influenced by Philo’s mystical reflection on the Logos than that both had used contemporary cosmological speculation based on Gen .

Traditions surveyed include pilgrimage to Jewish tem- ples and synagogues (Jerusalem, Elephantine, Leontopolis, Alexandria, and local synagogues); tombs of heroes and ancestors; Mt. Sinai; and other ritual cen- tres for both Jews (Pharos) and non-Jews (Edfu, El-Kanais). These traditions demonstrate continuities of identity with earlier Jewish and non-Jewish tradi- tions, but purported continuities with the innovations of later Christian pilgrim- age are more tenuous than often realized. Philo is frequently cited regarding the Jerusalem temple (pp. –), synagogues (pp. –), and Pharos (p. ). The allegorical methods of Philo and other Jews originated among non-Jews, as exemplified in the Derveni Papyrus (p. ). A long section devoted explic- itly to Philo concerns his understanding of ‘Arabia’ and the location of Mt. Sinai (pp. –; cf. , ). Like other Jewish authors surveyed, Philo locatedMt. Sinai in north-western Arabia, not the Sinai peninsula. (DTR; based on author’s abstract) 9858. J.

This research work under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Stegemann was accepted as a dissertation in Basel in . Philo’s writings are analysed together with Jubilees, the texts of Qumran, Josephus’ Antiquities, Macc and the Pseudo-Philonic Biblical Antiquities. In the long chapter on Philo a brief introduction discusses his education and his allegorical method. The research method outlined here dates back to the early nineties. Different exegetical tendencies of Philo’s writings are not mentioned and hermeneutical questions are not strongly prioritised.The account of the sacrifice of Isaac inAbr. is central. Material relating to the New Testament (the letters of Paul, Hebrews, but also James) is emphasized. Parallels to Jewish traditions are givenmore consideration than the Greek philosophical background. The author distinguishes between ‘Alexandria’ for Hellenistic traditions and ‘Jerusalem’ for Palestinian traditions. In addition, other texts of Philo are discussed, for example the offering of Isaac </page> <page sequence="58">  part two as parable to the behaviour of the wise (Fug. ff.). In Fug. ff. Isaac is the symbol of the man who receives the gift of wisdom. In Cher  Isaac is exemplified as the soul which loves virtue, bearing fruit through Divine powers. All in all, two different interpretations are offered for the writings of Philo. First, in the allegorical interpretation the wise man (Abraham) discovers the enjoyment (Isaac) as the embodiment of otherworldly life. Second, the offering is viewed from the point of the son Isaac himself: the willingness of the wise man (here Isaac) is symbolised as offering God his own spirit. Apparently Philo has drawn on the wisdom tradition of Early Judaism. Links to the Christology of John (for example John .–) on the basis of this Wisdom-literature are postulated. This also applies to the question of the Logos’ pre-existence. (GS) 9860. J. Laporte, Teologia liturgica di Filone d’Alessandria e Origene, Cammini nello Spirito  (Milan ).

The author signalizes in this treatise, which he considers as belonging to the genre of the moral sermon, three characteristic traits: () elaboration of the theme of mastering of the passions (which includes the themes of freedom of choice and that of the relation between pleasure, reason, and the senses); () polemics with Epicurean philosophy; () discussion of the question what is true well-being (εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α). Le Boulluec discusses these traits in three successive sections, and concludes that much further study of the Philonic concept of pleasure is needed, e.g. a comparison with the rabbinic notion of the ‘evil inclination’. But one thing is certainly clear: Philo’s reflection on &gt;δ ν  in all its complexity is in no way inferior to that of the philosophers. (HMK) 9862. J.-Y. Leloup, L. Boff and L. M.

This book is the result of a seminar on therapeutic psychology directed by the authors.

The expression ‘care of being’ is understood in the context of contemporary phenomenology and with a strong emphasis on transpersonal therapeutics. L. Boff contributes with a reflection on the life and writings of Francis of Assisi in the same perspective. </page> <page sequence="59"> critical studies   Leloup, finally, incorporates within the therapeutic proposal the anthropological perspective and methodology of the psychologist and philosopher Karlfried Graf Dürckheim (–), promoter of the ‘transpersonal psychotherapy’ which both authors find congruent with basic features of Philo’s Therapeutai. The treatise Contempl. is mentioned frequently as witness to the therapeutics practised by priests of the desert, who took care of the human phenomenon in its totality, involving the harmony of men and women, body and soul, immanence and transcendence. Philo can thus be considered an old instructor for the contemporary holistic therapies. A second edition was published in . (JPM) 9863. B.

In the author’s view Philo has become a hostage of the language of philosophy, which means that he has placed himself ‘out of bounds’ for the proper deploy- ment of Jewish thought. In order to support this thesis, he examines the Philonic conception of creation and compares it with that ofMidrash Rabbah. From the comparison it emerges that Philo has been constrained to think what he did not wish to think, the absolute nature of evil and the eternity of the posterity of Cain. Philo thus forgot what every Jew knows, namely that evil will come to an end. (JR) 9864. C.

The author demonstrates that the Stoic concept of  8κε ωσις (‘appropriation’, i.e. the natural instinct of every living being to strive after that which is salutary for himself, resulting in a harmonious relationship with the self and the world) is contrary to Philo’s views (in which ethics is not guided by instinct but by the Law of God, and based on reason). When Philo uses the term, it is in the sense of an implicit refutation of the Stoic view, but also charged with a positive meaning, in which  8κε ωσις approaches the Middle Platonist notion of  8κε ωσις τ=A  ε=A .

As the organiser of the conference and editor of this volume, Carlos </page> <page sequence="60">  part two Lévy, states in the Preface, the theme of the conference was inspired by the thesis of Valentin Nikiprowetzky that in Philo philosophy is used in the service of scripture. A number of papers comment on this thesis. Another aim of the conference was to see to what extent the advances in our knowledge of both Greek philosophy and Alexandrian Judaism are making it possible to offer new interpretations of Philonic thought. It would seem, however, that at the present time no consensus is being reached on how Philo should be read. This is illustrated by the diversity of approaches illustrated in this volume.

The question the author poses is how Philo selects his terminology in order to deal with the topic of the first principle,  ρ1 . In a general sense, Philo uses the term αBτι ν; in a specific sense, this incorporates the term nous in order to designate the first cause, although without the further Aristotelian attribution of ν ητ ς.This last term, instead of being an attribute of the cause, instead denotes the product of their action, i.e. the kosmos noêtos. In this way Philo produces a combination of Plato’s lexical tradition with that of Aristotle, in such a way that it is functional to express a biblical idea, namely of a Subject which conceives its own Logos. In this context, the use of αupsilonlenisταρκ στατ ν in Philo is Aristotelian rather than Stoic. (JPM) 9867. N.

He suggests that the Philonic texts of Spec. .– andMos. . convey the notion that in Philo’s time the Jews of Alexandria slaughtered a lamb for the Passover meal in their own houses, and regarded it as equivalent to the sacrificial lamb slain and offered up in the temple of Jerusalem. Such a practice he also finds supported by the Elephantine papyri, by the case of the temple at Leontopolis, and by the TYomTov ., which seems to indicate that some Jews prepared a lamb for the Passover in Rome, and called it a Passover offering. Philo’s reasoning in his texts seem to form an attempt to find a meaning and a justification for such a custom in a Diaspora context. (TS) 9868. S. Mathews, ‘Great is the Mystery of Godliness’.

This article aims to shed light on the argument by way of comparison with Cicero, who has been similarly labelled. As C. Lévy has demonstrated, Cicero’s thought forms a coherent whole and shows strong affinities to the new Academy (Carneades). His thought refrains from systematization and resorts to the eclecticism of dialogue, in order to leave the discussion open. Likewise, Philo’s thought is coherent and brings together distinct currents of thought (Stoic, Aristotelian) in the spirit of the New Academy of his day, which was on its way to forming the synthesis from which Neoplatonism would arise. At the same time Philo may well have been inspired by Jewish commentaries before him, as argued by R. Goulet. Philo’s thought is original in that his God is the God of Israel, and the knowledge of God is a gift from thisGod himself: it is grace. Academic scepticism here develops its extreme consequence within a religious perspective, resulting in negative theology and a theology of divine illumination. (HMK) 9873. T.

Philo is one of the three authors (together with Ezra and the author of Jubilees) who are studied in detail in order to illustrate this thesis. It is concluded that he recasts the written Mosaic Law as the perfect embodiment of universal Natural Law.

In the th century many Jewish scholars—stimulated by Christian scholar- ship—studied Hellenistic Judaism, esp. Philo, with a view to his supposed alien- ation from authentic Judaism and his congeniality to later Christian theology. Two famous names are ImmanuelWolf in his foundationalmanifesto from, and later on Zacharias Frankel, who emphasized the contrast to Palestinian exe- gesis. The liberal pioneer Isaac Marcus Jost, however, praised the synthesis of Judaism and Hellenism in Alexandria as a paradigm for modernization in Ger- many. Similarly, Maurice Wolff discovered Philo as a model for modern Jew- ish spirituality, while the position of Heinrich Graetz remains ambivalent. The scholarship on Alexandrian Judaism from  onwards is characterized by institutionalization and proliferation. Jacob Freudenthal and Moritz Friedlän- der, to mention two of the more important scholars, show an appreciation for the Jewishness of Philo and other authors. Reviews: D. R.

Basing himself on the second commandment of the Decalogue, Philo develops a philosophical position onpaganism.Hedistinguishes betweenpaganismof the Egyptians, who worship cats and dogs, and Greek paganism, in which natural elements, such as the stars, are deified. Philo’s view on mythology is complex. Following Plato he criticizes pagan myth, but he does appreciate philosophical mythology. He qualifies myth as by nature false and untrue, and contrasts it with truth. Niehoff </page> <page sequence="64">  part two sees a contradiction in Philo: he regards myth as foolishness, but he also makes use if it. On this score, he resembles Plato, who speaks negatively about myth, but tells his own stories as conveying philosophical truth, i.e. as a ‘logical myth’. Philo implicitly treats the creation account in Genesis as such a logical myth, making good use of Plato’s Timaeus in his interpretation. (ACG) 9878. H.

This Habilitationsschrift studies extensively the concept of canon in the st to th century c.e. A section is dedicated to the LXX and Philo. The latter uses καν&lt;ν in the sense of ‘normative rule’; in a juridical context this can be nature (Spec. .); in particular the Decalogue has a canonical function vis-à-vis the rest of the commandments. The expression κανDν τEς  λη ε ας is contrasted to myth and sophistry. Ultimately it consists in the cosmic order, incorporated in the Law. (DZ) 9879. E. F. Osborn, ‘Philo andClement: Quiet Conversion andNoetic Exegesis,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. Osborn returns once more to the question of the relation between Philo and Clement. The question of Philo’s influence on Clement is not the right question to ask, but rather, to what use did Clement put what he read in Philo. But here again one should not just look at the passages and words taken over. The question is: what did Clement do with them? Osborn suggest that two main purposes can be discerned. Firstly Clement quietly wants to convert Jews to the Christian faith and Philo could supply apologetic instruments to this end. Secondly Philo could supply the method of noetic exegesis of Scripture to show how the hiddenmeaning could be uncovered. Logical analysis is linked to divine vision. The techniques of logic and philosophy are not made redundant by prophetic inspiration, because its meaning is hidden, and has to be brought out in lucid teaching. In the final pages of the article Osborn returns to the methodological problems involved and makes a comparison with the method of Justin. Justin’s dialogue with Trypho was noisy. Clement’s appropriation of Philo was quiet and all the more effective. (DTR) 9880. A.

The author observes that the rabbis too are acquainted with this distinction, but the names associated with them are reversed. For a time it was thought that this was due to Philo’s faulty knowledge of Hebrew, but today it is regarded as probable that the Alexandrian drew on a tradition which is older than the rabbinic sources and that this doctrine could represent a difference between Palestinian and Alexandrian Judaism.

This article deals with Philo’s conception of his local environment. In the first part the author describes Philo’s negative attitude towards Egypt and the Egyptians. For him Egypt is a symbol of () body, () sense-perception, () passion. He interprets the Exodus from Egypt as the liberation of the soul from the body.Moreover, he shows a special hostility towards Egyptian idolatry, which implies worship of animals. Because of this condemnatory attitude towards the Egyptians, he makes a strong distinction between Jews and Egyptians. In the second part the author considers the question of Philo’s identification with Alexandria. Philo is proud ofAlexandria as his home town, and as a proper home for the Jews who live there. At the same time, he considers the city as a place unsuitable for understanding higher realities. (ACG) 9883. A. Petit, ‘Philon et le pythagorisme: un usage problématique,’ in C.

According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Philo was particularly attached to the  γωγF κατGΠλ τωνα κα  Πυ αγ ραν (HE ..). But Pythagoreanism, either in its dualistic (matter/the dyad co-eternal with God/themonad) or in itsmonis- tic version (the dyad/matter proceeding from the monad) is hard to reconcile with Philonic theology.The author, reviewing various solutions, inclines towards the hypothesis of a Philonic usage of monistic Pythagoreanism. One gets the impression of an instrumental dyad in Philo. If Philo was a Pythagorean, he was one of an unusual kind. (HMK) </page> <page sequence="66">  part two 9884. R.

The author complains about a certain lack of reciprocity in the study of the relations between Philo and the Greek philosophical tradition, as seen in the fact that almost all scholars are inclined to underline the debt that Philo has incurred to Greek philosophical thought, but virtually no one is prepared to admit the reverse, namely the influence that the Alexandrian could have exerted on thinkers of the Imperial age and on the Platonist tradition in general. If, however, one thinks of the distribution of Philo’s writings in the Christian era, along the three axes of Alexandria, Syria and Rome–Italy, which take their lead fromClement, Justin andAmbrose respectively, it is difficult not to place these in relation to the three major representatives of ‘secular’ thought, such as Alcinous (and the Middle Platonists in general), Numenius and Seneca. Both Numenius (whom Radice does not discuss explicitly) on the one hand and Alcinous and Seneca on the other reveal a number of fairly obvious points of contact with Philo. This can easily be observed if one places Philo within the confines of the Platonist tradition, as a representative of a particular line of thinking (p. ). (RR) 9885. C. L.

In Philo’s thought on the Temple two themes can be discerned: the cosmic temple and the temple-soul. A brief review of passages leads to the conclusion that Philo’s allegorical interpretation of the tabernacle/temple highlights on the one hand the cosmic character of true worship of God (the whole cosmos is called to worship), and on the other hand the spiritual worship to be rendered by the human soul as a microcosm. Philo achieves a brilliant synthesis between prophetic Judaism and the Stoa, while his interpretations have clearly influenced Clement and Origen. (HMK) 9886. R.

In the chapter on Plato, Philo and Platonic philosophy, Philo’s thoughts on the status of Greek philosophy, on creation as presented in Opif., on unity and plurality in God, and on the origin and destiny of souls are outlined.

The article combines a theoretical look at the question of the influence of Philo on early Christian thought with a practical example of how that influence took place. Starting point is the thesis of Valentin Nikiprowetzky that Philo’s use of philosophy is ‘instrumentalist’. This needs to be related to the fact that Philo places reason in the form of logos in Scripture itself. After outlining a number of difficulties involved in the study of Philo and the Fathers, the author sets outwhat he judges to be the four principal aspects of Philo’s influence: the central role of exegesis, the methods of exegesis (including allegory), the use of specific philo- sophical terminology, and the use of a number of particularly influential biblical texts. These aspects are then illustrated by means of two texts of the Alexan- drian theologian Didymus the Blind, the former from his Genesis commentary on the creation of humankind in Gen :–, the latter from the Commentary on Zechariah and involving the use of the verbum Philonicum  γαλματ   ρ ω. The article ends with some conclusions on the value of Nikiprowetzky’s thesis for the subject of Philo’s influence on the Fathers. It should be noted that very often in the Fathers philosophy becomes spirituality, a change that is anticipated in Philo himself. (DTR) 9888. D. T.

He discusses the Colossians’ religious conception and practice which Paul qualified as ‘philosophy according to the elements of the cosmos’ (Col :).

This study is concerned with the moral problematisation of sexual desire and intercourse in two Jewish/Christian writers of the first century of our era, namely Philo of Alexandria and St. Paul. A detailed methodological chapter </page> <page sequence="70">  part two argues for a fundamental re-thinking of the analysis of Jewish and Christian writings of this period in line with the theoretical discussion which is taking place in cognate disciplines like classics, philosophy, sociology and history: the author argues that a social constructionist perspective on the study of ‘sexuality’ in antiquity is called for in the study of Philo and Paul, that is, an approach which regards sexual desire and behaviour as a social phenomenon rather than a ‘nat- ural given’. This methodological part is followed by an extensive summary and review of the critical responses to the historical proposals of Michel Foucault on the history of ‘sexuality’ in antiquity, which are taken as the focus of this study. Rather than an extensive critique of Foucault’s proposals themselves, however, the focus of this study is on reading two important authors representing strands of first-century Hellenistic Judaism, which Foucault’s work ignores altogether. The author presents an extensive study of Philo and Paul, analysing their moral problematisation of desire and intercourse, and comparing Foucault’s historical suggestions with the results. The study suggests that reading Hellenistic Jew- ish texts would help to correct and sometimes explain some of Foucault’s sug- gestions with regard to this historical period in the ‘history of sexuality’.

It is generally agreed that Philo has a positive view of the female members of the community at Lake Mareotis which is described in Contempl. The author questions this view, taking as his point of reference Philo’s attitude to ‘pretty slave boys’ used for sexual purposes, to whom he ascribes the ‘female disease’. Philo was forced to accommodate the Therapeutrides even though he did not approve of their presence in the community as such. He describes them as ‘mostly aged virgins’ because his view of γυνα(κες (as opposed to παρ  ν ι) does not permit him to ascribe positive values to them. (DTR; based on author’s abstract) 9899. H.

In Contempl. he contrasts the ‘banquets’ of the Therapeutae and Therapeutrides with ancient συμπ σια, at which pretty slave boys were present. Szesnat discusses Philo’s condemnation of intercourse ofmen with these slave boys, to whom Philo ascribes the ‘female disease’. The author argues that this disease concerns the attachment of what is regarded as female (passion, body) to a man. When boys are used for sexual purposes, their souls and bodies are changed into a female form. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="71"> critical studies   98100. J. E. Taylor and P. R.

This article deals with some aspects of the religious community ofTherapeu- tae which Philo describes in Contempl. The authors argue that the designation  εραπευτα  is not restricted to this community but has to be understood uni- versally. Therapeutae are persons who are devotees of God or people who serve him. Philo finds a prominent example of them outside Alexandria. The location has to be situated on an hill on the south-west side of the town. The authors discuss the participation of women in the community. With regard to the socio- economic grouping they conclude that members of the community came from educated Jewish circles in Alexandria. (ACG) 98101. J. W.

The author discusses a form of argumentation used by the author of the Epis- tle to the Hebrews, namely argumentation that concerns categories of the fitting, the necessary and the impossible.This use is unique in Scripture and it has been suggested that Philo forms the background of its use. In his interpretation of the Bible, Philo avoids inappropriate views on God. It is, for instance, inappropri- ate for God to punish personally. The anthropomorphic language of God in the OT is also inappropriate for God. Philo never, however, considers the practice of the Jewish sacrifices as inappropriate for God. These are symbols of realities that are necessitated by the nature of reality and of God. The author concludes that Philo’s ‘understanding of necessity and appropriateness was shaped not only by the tradition of the philosophers, but by his commitment to Judaism as well’ (p. ).

Although Philo figures in this article mainly in the title and in brief general references, the subject matter of the article nonetheless is of great interest for students of Philo as one of our most important witnesses of Hellenistic Judaism and the period immediately preceding the rise of Christianity. It is Alexandria, not Jerusalem, which has provided the Greek world with the first information on the Jewish people: the first Greek historian we know to have written about the Jews was Hecataeus of Abdera in his ethnographic work on Egypt. Troiani very briefly discusses, with reference to modern debate, Hecataeus’ excursus on the Jews, which combines elements of the book of Exodus with Egyptian traditions </page> <page sequence="72">  part two and at the same time seems to reveal views of Diaspora Judaism on its own past and institutions. ‘Hellenization’ in its original sense was the requisite for integration in the civil administration and the army. Notables of every ethnic origin could be called ‘Greeks’. Hellenization appears to have been promoted by the Jewish elites (cf. the books of the Maccabees). The author then points out the international dimension of Judaism in the Hellenistic or Greco-Roman period, and argues that this is not sufficiently taken into account when common exegesis identifies the ethnê in the NT with Gentiles (e.g. in Acts :). This term, apart from indicating Jewish communities in many nations of the ancient world, can also have the connotation of ‘those that know nothing of the law’ (cf. John :). The author argues that Hellenism played an important role in the differentiation between strict adherents of the Law of Moses and Jews with an Hellenistically ‘enlightened’ approach to the Law (for which cf. Strabo ..–). He quotes other sources (Josephus, Justin, Eusebius) to support the probability of an interpretation of ‘Greeks’ as ‘Hellenized Jews’ (in e.g. John :, and with reference to Paul’s audiences in Acts); Jews of the Diaspora seem sometimes not to have been circumcised. Christianity, then, may have absorbed these ‘Greeks’. In the conclusion it is suggested that the rapid ‘Hellenization’ of Christianity may find an explanation in Christianity being rooted precisely in the ‘Greek’, Hellenized part of Judaism.

P. Lemche and H. Tronier (edd.), Etnicititet i Bibelen [Danish: Ethnicity in the Bible] (Copenhagen ) –. In this article Tronier compares the ways Philo and Paul argue in determining the identity of their respective groups, finding great similarities between the two men. Both ways of arguing are to be read as Hellenistic, and inner-Jewish, but they are also related in other ways. Concerning Philo, Tronier especially inves- tigates Her. – and Migr. –. He finds the identity of the Jews to be rooted in the philosophical community of interpretation. This community, fur- thermore, mirrors a transcendental reality above time and space. The task of allegorical interpretation is to recognize the general in the particular, the univer- sal, cognitive and transcendental in the particular and empirical. Jewish identity mirrors the transcendental; ethnic-specific praxis mirrors and realizes the uni- versal transcendental reality (κ σμ ς ν ητ ς). Philo’s community is κ σμ ς in : ν ς, and its ethic mirrors κ σμ ς too as κ σμ ς in H  ς. Philo’s and Paul’s construction of the identity of their respective communities is not somuch con- cerned with the ethnic versus the universal, but in a different understanding of the relation between the universal/transcendental, and the concrete/particu- lar, an understanding that also leads to a different praxis. Tronier finds, further- more, that Paul’s allegory in Gal :– is closely related to Philo’s. At the same time, however, it corresponds to the attitudes of the allegorists denounced by Philo inMigr. –, which led to their abandonment of the observance of the </page> <page sequence="73"> critical studies   ritual Torah. By introducing apocalyptic cosmology into his interpretation, Paul develops a change in view that makes him construct a new, third ethnic group, with a new praxis. (TS) 98104. W. M.

He is the first to make the connection between Scripture and Platonism. Various texts are cited to illustrate God’s essential unknowability.

Wan, ‘Commentary as Pedagogical Guide: Scripture and Commentary in the Thoughts of Philo Judaeus,’ Journal of Humanities East/West (Taiwan)  () –. The article commences with reflections on the relation between scripture and education. They might seem to be natural allies, but in actual fact there is potentially a strong conflict between them. Scripture projects its authority through self-transcendence, but this can have the effect of making it remote. Education is meant to project its ideals on the community. One way of linking the two is through scriptural commentary as a pedagogical instrument to bridge the gap between scripture and educational ideals. In the remainder of the article the author pursues this subject with specific reference to Philo. He first explains how Plato and the Platonist tradition used allegory to make Homer morally and intellectually palatable. He then explains how the Torah or Law functioned in Hellenistic Judaism. It is clear that Torah-centred education was in competition with Greek liberal education. Philo accords the latter some value, but mainly because ultimately it will lead the soul to seek the higher reality of moral and spiritual values. In this process scriptural commentaries, especially in the allegorical mode, play a vital role. The remainder of the article sets out how </page> <page sequence="74">  part two Philo produced different kinds of commentaries to fulfil his aim of guiding the initiate into the deeper truth of the Torah, which leads the soul to a vision of God. It might seem, Wan concludes, that Philo’s strategy was a failure, but in a different Christian setting it actually became ‘wildly successful’ (p. ). It may be concluded that scripture and commentary can live in a hermeneutical symbiosis. It is in fact commentary that makes scripture finally acceptable to a community. Without a commentary tradition scripture would not survive. So educators have to be interpreters of their own traditions. At the end of the article there is a summary in Chinese. (DTR) 98107. B.

The example of the Therapeutae shows that ‘holistic health and spiritual worship are inextricably entwined’. (DZ) 98109. J. Whittaker, ‘How to Define the Rational Soul,’ in C. Lévy (ed.), Philon d’Alexandrie et le langage de la philosophie, Monothéismes et Philosophie (Turnhout ) –. Modern editors in Det.  and Praem.  read κ κληται (‘has been named’) to the effect that according to Philo ν upsilontildeς κα  λ γισμ ς (Det.) or ν upsilontildeς κα  λ γ ς (Praem.) were in use as definitions of the highest form of soul. Neither of these designations, however, belongs to the usual Middle Platonic repertoire of terms. Whittaker argues that κεκλ ρωται (‘has been allotted’; cf. Conf.  and Spec. .) should be read instead. The couplets ν upsilontildeς κα  λ γισμ ς/λ γ ς nevertheless do have their own history, and this history is sketched by the author by means of a learned discussion of passages from, among others, Plutarch, </page> <page sequence="75"> critical studies   Plato, Cicero, Calcidius, Marcus Aurelius, Gregory of Nyssa and Philo himself. A recurrent theme in these passages is man’s relation to the Divine. At the end of the article, Whittaker focuses on the triad ν upsilontildeς/λ γ ς/αBσ ησις in Philo and other authors.

The author writes his article in reaction to recent attempts to present Philo not only as a misogynist, but as the author of later Western misogyny. The chief proponent of this view which he argues against is D. Boyarin, who compares Philo’s platonizing soul-body dualism unfavourably with the rabbinic view of the body-soul relationship; see RRS  and a. Winston argues that both in the case of Philo and the rabbis much depends on the rhetoric of the passage as determined by the context. In fact often both share the same view which denigrates the body in comparison with the soul. Moreover Boyarin is mistaken in thinking that Philo’s divinization of soul necessarily leads to a great degree of asceticism and a down-grading of the body. Philo’s positive views towards physical reality can be seen in his view that marriage is more than merely procreative necessity, but can also be the occasion for genuine love. Just like the rabbis, Philo has a fundamentally positive evaluation of the sexual act. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Philo was thoroughly androcentric in his thinking, and there appear to be some traces of misogyny in his thought. No answer is given, however, to whether Philo is more or less misogynistic than the rabbis. (DTR) </page> <page sequence="76">  . W. Aalders, De Septuagint: brug tussen synagoge en kerk [Dutch: The Septuagint: Bridge between Synagogue and Church] (Hee- renveen ). The author, a senior Dutch theologian (born in ), presents here a per- sonal and theological reflection on the Septuagint, which he considers to be a bridge between the Jewish synagogue and the Christian church. Philo plays an important role in the book because he is regarded as the ‘Jewish crown-witness to the Septuagint’ (p. ). Later in the book he devotes an entire chapter to him, entitled ‘Philo Alexandrinus as theologian of the Septuagint’ (pp. –). Philo’s great achievement is that he pointed out the comprehensibility of divine rev- elation. He is the chief witness to a renaissance of Jewish thought inspired by the Greek translation of the Torah. His interpretation of the creation account is important because he deduces from it the unity of creation and identifica- tion of the order in the cosmos with the divine Logos. The author emphasizes that Philo’s theology also relates to the work of God in history, and contains an eschatological and messianic perspective. It is suggested that the emphasis on salvation history and eschatology is the result of the experience of confrontation that he had with the Emperor Caligula. ‘His language [in Legat.] is no longer that of a contemplative theologian, but of the writer of a diary in a concentration camp or a prison, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer or Jochen Klepper’ (p. ).

It attempts to give an analysis of the allegorical interpretation of the Patriarchs’ migra- tions or flights (concentrating mainly on the case of Abraham) as a condition for reaching virtue by their natural endowment. This theme shows how Philo accommodates Stoic and Middle Platonist definitions of the goal of human life (telos) to his own purpose. In the course of the inquiry the difficult prob- lem is encountered of the Philonic conception of the relation between human individual, human generic and divine intellect(s). Some doubts are expressed about the appropriateness of Philo’s use of the Stoic (and Peripatetic) con- cepts of πνεupsilontildeμα as a means to express divine life and to indicate the differ- ence between earthly and heavenly (or noeric) intellect(s).

In this dissertation the author studies literary, epigraphical and archaeologi- cal sources contemporaneous with the period of the Second Temple. Due to his more than two dozen references to synagogues, Philo of Alexandria is used as one of the most important sources of information about Second Temple syna- gogues.The book is divided in main sections, dealing with the Sources, Termi- nology, Palestinian synagogues, Diaspora synagogues, Synagogue functionaries, Synagogue functions, and Sectarian synagogues (the Essenes, Therapeutae and the Samaritans). It is concluded that the synagogues are not to be considered as rivals to the Temple. The fact that Philo and Josephus could hold both institu- tions in high esteem strongly speaks against such an oppositional relationship. The synagogues should rather be viewed as an extension of the Temple; as sub- sidiary sacred precincts that extended spatially the sacrality of the Temple shrine and allowed Jews everywhere participation within the central cult, the shrine of the Holy One in Jerusalem.

Although Abraham’s prayer in Her. – has several distinctive features, the similarities with the Hodayot suggest that it is an Alexandrian example of the same kind of prayer. Flaccus’ prayer in Flacc. –, and the whole treatise Against Flaccus, belong to the writings which present the view that those who attack God or God and His people suffer punishments. Writings of this kind are the book of Esther and parts of the books of Daniel and Maccabees. A parallel is also found in Rev . Abraham’s prayer illustrates how a cited text in Philo’s Allegorical Commentary is interpreted by means of expository paraphrases and elaborations in which various biblical texts are woven together. In the treatise Flacc. the interpretation of the Laws of Moses in the practice and crisis of communal life is the main issue.

In his discussion of the knowledge of the self as superior to that of the world, the author regards Philo as the first ancient thinker to have asserted this superiority. When reflecting on the travels of Abraham, the Alexandrian shows that there is no need for the person who is able to know himself to make a detour involving the consideration of nature. One can speak of an ‘Abrahamic Socratism’. (JR) 9912. D. K. Buell,TheMaking of the Christians: Clement of Alexandria and the Rhetoric of Legitimacy (Princeton ), esp. – and passim. The author argues that ancient assumptions about procreation played a role in how early Christians imagined and constructed their relations with each other. She compares Philo andClement of Alexandria in terms of their attitudes toward sexual conduct and the role of the metaphors of procreation and ingestion in conjunction with the education of the soul, and shows how Philo’s agricultural imagery for procreation was a source for Clement’s metaphors of procreation.

The author does not wish to enter into the debate on the authenticity or oth- erwise of De deo, but on the basis of a provisional acceptance of its authenticity she proposes, firstly, to compare the language and the philosophical contents of the work with parallel passages in the Philonic corpus. Secondly, she wishes to see whether it is possible to find a rationale for the author’s recourse to the text of Isaiah instead of limiting himself to exegesis of Genesis as he usually does. On the basis of a detailed and well-documented analysis of the texts, which focuses on the nature of the divine Powers, the author concludes that the presentation of the Powers is somewhat toned down in comparison with the views found in the Philonic corpus. In the De Deo they are understood as ‘ways of acting and man- ifestations of God’, and are not linked with the moral journey of the progressing soul. As for the citation of Isa , this would be a unique case in Philo, but could be justified in that this lemma enables him to link the doctrine of the Powers to the scriptural account.

His philosophy represents the third of three turning-points that determine the history of Western thought. Cohen’s interpretation is thus a revision of Wolfson’s thesis that Philo and Spinoza were revolutionary thinkers who have decisively influenced the development of thought. Wolfson sees the history of thought determined by the relation between reason and revelation. In the ancient period reason and revelation were separate; in the medieval period, inaugurated by Philo, reason and revelation were in harmony; in the third period, that begins with Spinoza, reason dominates revelation. Revising Wolfson’s thesis Cohen claims that () Bergson represents the beginning of a third epoch, the contemporary period, and that () it is in fact this third period, and not the medieval period, that represents the harmonisation of reason and revelation.

In this study on the interpretations of the story of Cain and Abel by philoso- phers through history, the first chapter deals with Philo’s exegesis. Dijkhuis offers an overview of Philo’s interpretation. Cain is generated by Eve, symbol of sense perception, and Adam, who symbolizes the mind. The name Cain means pos- session and he thinks that all things are his own possession, not regarding God as creator. He is placed opposite to Abel, who refers all things to God. Pro- tagoras, who thinks that man is the measure of all things, is an offspring of Cain’s madness. Because Cain regards himself as his own possession he is also a self-lover, whereas Abel is a lover of God. The characterization of Cain as self-loving Philo is inspired by Plato (Laws d–e). Cain challenges Abel for a dispute in order to master him with sophistical tricks. He kills his brother but Philo explains that in reality Cain kills himself: he loses the virtuous life; Abel continues to live the happy life in God. Cain builds a city, that means he constructs his own world view. Philo’s interpretation influenced Christian thought: both Ambrose and Augustine follow Philo’s exegesis of the two broth- ers.

Unlike the latter, however, Döring does not look for sources in Philo’s interpretation of Jewish feasts, but at best for traditions. After a general discussion of the passages on the Sabbath in Philo, he deals with the single prescriptions. They show that Philo knew precise halachic practices from different Jewish origins. He interprets them within the horizon of his Greek and Jewish formation. He has a universalistic conception of the Sabbath which is grounded in the creation of the world and looks forward to the acceptance of the Sabbath by all peoples in the end of times. Nevertheless, arguing against the extreme allegorists, he insists that the Sabbath should be literally observed. An appendix on the Therapeutae highlights that they honour the sabbath by breaking their fast on this day (Contempl. ). Reviews: H. Weiss, SPhA  () –. (DZ) 9922. T.

The author proposes two possible answers, then suggests a method for choosing between them, and finally elab- orates on a close reading of the whole work to bring out its comprehensive and coherent meaning. The Philonic work has long been treated as a ‘moral philo- sophical treatise’. Engberg-Pedersen, however, opts for its genre as a ‘fictional story’ (πλ σμα). After presenting his arguments for this genre, he carries out a close reading of Philo’s work, finding that it exhibits such a degree of literary coherence that he finds it to vindicate his proposal that the treatise is a fiction. Hence scholars should not go on asking questions about the historicity of the Therapeutae. Basically, the good scholarly questions to be asked should be about Philo and ‘his’Therapeutae, not about ‘the’Therapeutae as such. Hence the trea- tise is a ‘philosopher’s dream’. (TS) 9923. S.

The author demonstrates, on the basis of exact research, that the Armenian text of the Deo was produced in an environment that was both Greek and Christian. It must be said that the understanding of the original Philonic text is not always satisfactory, because the translator stands at too great a distance from Philo’s philosophical sensibility. In spite of this, the author concludes, the Armenian version of Deo was of considerable significance at the time in which the exegesis was prepared. (RR) 9925. J.

Frey first summarizes the history of research on the background of the opposition between flesh and spirit in history of religion. When the discussion of the Qumran discoveries faded out, the derivation from Hellenistic Judaism prevailed (E. Brandenburger, cf. R-R ). Frey however criticizes the use of Wisdom and Philo to defend this thesis. In Wisdom human mortality is contrasted not with πνεupsilontildeμα, but with σ   α. Philo’s abstract use of σ ρ is conditioned by the Bible. It designates earthly existence, which is not in itself opposed to God. Not even in Her.  is there a dualism of classes of human beings. Neither the sinfulness of σ ρ nor its character as cosmic power has a real analogy in these authors. Instead Frey again points to the Qumran texts, especially the recently deciphered wisdom-instructions Q–, to show that already in wisdom-circles of Palestine in the rd and nd century b.c.e. the traditional ethical dualism had been widened with a cosmic and eschatological dimension.

Thismonograph, based on aMcMaster doctoral dissertation under the super- vision of A. Mendelson, is the first comprehensive study devoted to the theme of providence in Philo’s thought. The author sets out to determine how Philo con- ceptualizes the idea of providence, and whether it is possible to interpret the ref- erences to the idea that are scattered throughout his works into a coherent con- ception. The structure of the study is primarily determined by its starting-point, Philo’s famous summary of the five chief doctrines that contribute to piety and well-being inOpif. –. There the doctrine of providence is specially tied to those of the existence and nature of God and of creation. Accordingly the first two chapters examine Divine transcendence and Divine immanence in relation </page> <page sequence="84">  part two to providence. The third then moves on to providence in relation to Philo’s theory of creation. The fourth and fifth chapters examine two more specific themes, namely providence and astral fatalism and theodicy and providence. A sixth and rather brief chapter takes on the subject of providence and history, looking at providence in relation both to individuals and to the Jewish people as a whole. In his conclusion the author states that Philo’s conception of divine providence is central to his theology as a whole. Indeed he claims that it is no exaggeration to declare that this doctrine is the structural pillar which gives Philonic theology its coherence. Reviews: F. Avemarie, Jud  () – ; P.

The origins of the Christian Trinity, however, are sought in the family-constellation of Father, Mother and Son (cf. Ebr. ) and in the later development of Platonic principles inMiddle Platonism.

The author analyzes the concept of δια  ρ  in Philo, and distinguishes two patterns of understanding difference. The Greek philosophical pattern is based on the contradiction of opposites within the identity of the subject that supports them. Philo proposes its own pattern to understand difference, which focuses on a radical distance between the capacities of human mind and the inexhaustible action of the divine Wisdom. It is not within man’s disposition to understand this sense of difference, but comes upon him. In diverse ways, we find the development of this idea in medieval and modern thought. (JPM) 9929. R. M.

For Paul, theDeutero-paulinewritings and the letters of Peter, baptismmeans a new structuring of the dominion over the passions. In antiquity, especially in Hellenistic Judaism, this control is not connected with a rite (Philo’s allegorizing of circumcision is noted as an exception). The solutions offered by Maccabees and Philo are characterized as ‘remaining within the system’. In contrast to what is found in Maccabees, in Philo the passions are not only to be cultivated by reason, but there are also statements which tend to their elimination. But this corresponds to steps in human perfection. Again in contrast to Maccabees, the role of divine help is emphasized in Philo. For Paul, however, man has to change the system and become a Christian. He is less optimistic than Maccabees or Philo about the possibility to dominate the passions by reason or by means of the Law.

The Stoic doctrine of the πρ π  ειαι or ‘pre-emotions’ concerns the invol- untary pre-emotional and pre-rational response to sudden events. The history and conceptual significance of the doctrine are difficult to trace. Some scholars think it is a late doctrine, while others believe it is part of the early Stoic sys- tem. In the present article the author examines Philonic evidence that has so far not been taken into scholarly consideration. These texts are located mainly in the Quaestiones in Genesim (esp. QG ., ., ., ., .–, .). It is not to be expected that Philo’s treatment of the question will necessar- ily conform to the usage of his Stoic sources. His evidence is nevertheless of great value when it coincides with what is found in other witnesses, e.g. in Cicero and Seneca. On the basis of Philo’s evidence, it may be inferred that the concept already belonged to an earlier period of Stoicism. The study has been reprinted in the volume edited by F.

Van der Horst rejects McKay’s claim, arguing inter alia that Philo and Josephus call the places of assembly πρ σευ1α  and πρ σευκτ ρια (houses of prayer) and that it is improbable that in these houses no prayer occurred on the Sabbath. There is, at least, one pagan author, Agatharchides of Cnidos (c. – b.c.e.), who mentions praying of the Jews on the Sabbath. Moreover reading and teaching the Torah were regarded as a form of worship. For a Dutch version of this article see . (ACG) 9938. C. Hutt, ‘Qumran and the Ancient Sources,’ in D. Parry and E.

Philo, for example, intro- duces into his account certain Hellenistic themes like preference for spirit over body and male over female. One must also use caution in assessing later sources like Eusebius and Jerome, who connect the Essenes with Christianity. Only an adherence to positivism and physicalism will anchor any subsequent claims to surety in deriving information from these sources about the Qumran commu- nity. (EB) 9939. A. Jakab, ‘Le judaïsme hellénisé d’Alexandrie depuis la fonda- tion de la ville jusqu’à la révolte sous Trajan,’ Henoch  () –. The article attempts to trace the history of the Jewish community of Alexan- dria from its foundation until the age of Trajan. It includes archeological evi- dence from early Hellenistic times and describes the Hellenistic Jews as a pros- perous community, whose members belonged to all classes of society. With the coming of Roman rule ( b.c.e.) the political situation started to deteriorate, and Jews became the main targets for Greeks hostile to Roman rule. In the first century a number of incidents took place that forced the Jewish community to withdraw to one area. After the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem ( c.e.) they had to pay a special tax, and the repression of the Jewish revolt under Trajan (–) appears to have led to the extermination of Judaism in Alexandria. Philo’s work Flacc. is used to exemplify the social and legal status of first cen- tury Judaism when the situation was beginning to become grave, and his Legat. is utilized for its important historical information.

After a sketch of pre-Philonic Alexandrian exegesis (pp. –) the author dwells on the biblical text of Philo and its authority, as well as on Philo’s hermeneutical terms, esp. the concept of typos in his theory of knowledge and in pedagogical contexts. These are seen against the background of the Platonic thought of model and image, which is applied in Philo’s doctrine of creation, esp. of the spirit as image of God. Here Julius notes a difference between the ontological concept in Opif. and a more soteriological one in Leg. (see also pp. –). Scripture has a ‘typical’ character, too, because there historical- human contents correspond to spiritual facts, which have a normative function. On p.  a difference is drawn between this kind of typology and allegory as continuous metaphor. Abr. – and Ebr. – are analyzed as examples of such an exegesis. The author there detects fixed models of interpretation, which reveal the scholarly context. This is esp. perceptible in the opposition of figures like Jacob and Esau under different aspects. Julius wants to show that a similar exegetical school is responsible for preconceived Pauline typologies which transcend their context.

The Bible is now seen as such an integral part of the development of Western culture that it is easy to forget that this has not always been the case.

Secondly he gives an account of the origin of theGreek and Latin versions of theBible.Thirdly he relates how the method of biblical interpretation developed in the West. For each section he gives a complex but most illuminating diagram indicating the main trends. Philo as the major representative of Jewish-Hellenistic biblical interpretation is frequently referred to in the final section. According toKamesar theAntiochene tradition of interpretation in the th century c.e. came about as a direct reaction to the Philonic-Origenian tradition, yet there seems also to have been a connection between the classical scholarship of the Alexandrian tradition and the methods of the Antiochene school. It must be suspected, he concludes, that there are some lines of connection between Philo’s ‘literalist’ predecessors and the Antiochene school, but these need to be further elucidated. (DTR) 9942.

The dissertation written under the supervision of K. J. Torjesen supports two theses. () In his allegorical interpretation of Scripture Philo drew upon Jewish wisdom mythology, a mode of thinking that employed a personification of wisdom partially derived from Egyptian myths of the goddesses Maat and Isis. () A major focus of Philo’s allegorical interpretation was a studied attempt to relate Jewish beliefs to the practices and concepts of Hellenistic paideia. The treatise Congr. is used as an example to show how Philo’s ideas related to the twin themes of wisdom and paideia. It is concluded that wisdom was a common discourse relating to both Jewish and Hellenistic traditions. Through the use of wisdom mythology Philo was able to interpret both traditions as well as build his own hermeneutical system. (DTR; based on DAI-A –, p. ) 9943. H. M.

Keizer, Life Time Entirety: a Study of ΑΙΩΝ in Greek Literature and Philosophy, the Septuagint and Philo (diss. University of Amsterdam ). This study is devoted to the development of the meaning and interpretation of the Greek word α8&lt;ν in the period from Homer to Philo. Although ‘eternity’ is the best-known meaning of α8&lt;ν, its earliest attested meaning is ‘life’. Inves- tigation of the usage and meaning of α8&lt;ν in Greek literature, from Homer up to and including the Hellenistic period (Chapter II), leads to the conclusion that α8&lt;νmeans here either ‘lifetime’, more specifically a complete or completed life (life-lot), or ‘all time’ (past, future, or both). Where the role of α8&lt;ν in Greek philosophy is concerned (Chapter III), it is argued that for Plato and Aristotle, life as a whole of time is the seminal notion in their reflection on α8&lt;ν and time (1ρ ν ς). Hellenistic (immanentist) philosophy uses α8&lt;ν to designate ‘all time’ in relation to the universe. The other path in the history of α8&lt;ν is the usage and meaning of the word in the Biblical context, i.e. in the Septuagint (Chapter IV). It emerges thatα8&lt;ν in the Septuagint is the standing translation of #olâm. #Olâm, and hence α8&lt;ν in the Biblical sense, is time constituting the human temporal horizon. Formulated in another way, it is all time coinciding with the created world. Chapter V of the book is devoted to the biblical exegesis of Philo, the first author in whom we find the meeting of the worlds of Greek thought and the Bible documented. The chapter investigates Philo’s interpretation of Biblical aiôn and the role he allots to philosophical α8&lt;ν (the latter especially inHer. , Mut. , and Deus –). It is concluded that Philo in his exegesis of the bib- lical words aiôn and aiônios keeps to the biblical, i.e., ‘creational’, meaning of the words, also when the adjective pertains to God. In Philo’s conception of Platonic α8&lt;ν, the notion of ‘life’ again is important. For Philo, the intelligible world no less than the perceptible world is created by God. α8&lt;ν in Philo is not used for the life of God (as the doubly emended text ofDeus  suggests) but in whatever meaning it is used, it describes what belongs to the created realm.

The final section focuses on Philo’s presentation of Abraham as astronomer. Abraham’s Chaldean background is acknowledged, but in contrast to Josephus, Philo is not interested in crediting the Chaldeans with the discovery of astronomy. Abraham himself is presented as a kind of Jewish Plato who proceeds from the visible to the immaterial and conceptual. He thus anticipates Plato’s later reflections on the role of astronomy.

The stated aim of this long article is to determine what sorts of theological and religious themes are connected with the idea of kipper (atonement) in Jewish texts written and read around the time of Jesus. The Old Testament is not dealt with per se in this article, but the author examines the etymology of kipper (pp. –), including reference to Philonic material. The author finds that Philo’s writings provide a way of understanding the term  ρ ν ς τEς 1 ριτ ς in Hebr : as ‘the mercy seat’, an equivalent translation of ‘kapporet.’ Furthermore, in the section on Philo (pp. –), he finds that repentance is an important element in Philo’s understanding of expiation. Indeed it would seem that, according to Philo, expiation is possible only when it is accompanied by the right attitude of the heart: repentance from the one that sinned and prayers for the sinner said by the priest who performs the expiation ritual.

Philo’s discussion of proselytes sheds light upon two ‘call to discipleship’ pas- sages in the New Testament, Mark :– and Luke :–. Although the NT mentions proselytizing explicitly only once (Matt :) and in a negative sense, these two passages clearly point to proselytizing among early Christians. Unlike other such passages, they mention the leaving of one’s home and family, and the Mark passage also mentions a new home and family. Similarly, Philo’s discussion of proselytes, which must reflect a well-known Hellenistic under- standing, includes leaving one’s home and family in order to join a ‘new and godly commonwealth’ (Spec. .–). Whereas the motive for leaving one’s background in the Philonic passage is ‘for the sake of virtue and religion’, the implied motive in the NT passages is to follow Jesus’ teaching. The twofold Sitz im Leben of the passages includes the call to follow the historical Jesus and the later proselytizing by Jewish and non-Jewish Christians. (DTR) 9949. O. Leaman, ‘Philo,’ in R. L.

Within each section, profiles are arranged alphabetically by philosopher, and the profile of Philo comes last in the book. Explaining that Philo used allegorical interpretation to understand the Bible in terms of Greek philosophy, Leaman surveys Philo’s views on a number of philosophical issues: form,matter, and creation; divine providence, the existence of evil, and aspects of divine intervention in the world; ways of knowing God; and natural, divine, and human law. He notes that Philo ‘is generally credited with being the originator of the notion of negative theology, according to which one has to be satisfied with knowing what God is not as opposed to what he is’. Though ‘Philo is often seen as too eclectic . . . to be a really interesting thinker’, one finds in his thought ‘some unusual and intriguing ideas’. (EB) 9950. J. R.

These passages reflect what M.

Themes found in Philo that are echoed in Wisdom include the distinction between death of the body and that of the soul, the notion that spiritual death ‘entered the world’ as a punishment whenAdam disobeyed God’s commandment, the idea that Cain experienced his punishment when he killed Abel, and the idea that Abel, though physically dead, remains alive to God.

The title of the study refers to its main subject, a thorough historical analysis of the background of the description of God in Rev : as ‘the One who is and who was and who is to come’. Two sections survey the evidence that Philo can bring to the discussion. In the first (pp. –) the author first emphasizes that for Philo God is essentially nameless, as is clear from a number of texts which are given a brief analysis. Next it has to be asked whether Philo knew about the tetragrammaton in Hebrew. It is concluded that he certainly knew about it and may have seen it as underlying the LXX terms   3ν and κupsilonacuteρι ς. He may well not have known how it was pronounced, but was aware of restrictions in its use. In the second section (pp. –) McDonough discusses the evidence on Philo’s use of the Septuagintal self-description of God as   3ν and of its philosophical equivalent τ4 @ν. The pre-existing convergence of these two descriptions was a vital source of inspiration for Philo’s project of reconciling religion and philosophy. In contrast to Plato and the Platonists Philo does not use τ4 @ν for the forms. Only God is ‘real being’, whichmeans that he is radically different firstly to all idols, and secondly to all other beings. It is also possible that Philo derived God’s necessary being from the epithet   3ν, a step that is also found in Greek philosophy. The discussion concludes with a brief examination of the question whether Philo takes the epithets to indicate God’s everlasting or timeless being. The most important text here is Deus , which in fact contains a Dreizeitenformel parallel to Rev :. (DTR) 9955. M.

The fictive speeches found in Flacc. do not allow the work to be classified as pragmatic historiography, but fit the mimetic genre. The upshot of the treatise as formulated in § that God does not desert his people does not yet prove a destination to Jews (against Gerschmann), whereas the lack of a specific Jewish terminology, the pagan colour in which Judaism is presented, and the emphasis on the loyalty to the emperor indicate that Flacc. is written for pagan readers (the </page> <page sequence="94">  part two position held by Goodenough). Its apologetic intention is demonstrated by an analysis of the five speeches placed in the mouth of Flaccus; they show the topics of the speech which an enemy of God would be expected to deliver after having been chastised. Since the word ρετ  does not occur, the treatise can hardly have had the title Περ   ρετ=ν. (DZ) 9956. J.

Najman, ‘The Law of Nature and the Authority of Mosaic Law,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The author discusses the question how Philo authorizes the law of Moses. Although Moses’ law was given to a particular people, it has universal signif- icance. Philo claims that Moses’ law is the most excellent copy of the law of nature. Moses’ written law is not a denigration of the unwritten laws of nature, as Hellenistic thinkers might think. The story of the translation of the Pentateuch shows that the Septuagint has divine authorization. Because Moses’ law begins with an account of creation and the lives of the patriarchs, not with particular laws, it has universal significance. For Philo, the law of nature is the law of reason, and therefore human beings, endowed with reason, are able to live according to the law of nature. The aim of Philo’s allegorical interpretations is to show the authority of Mosaic law: particular laws, explained by allegorical interpretation, have universal significance. (ACG) 9961. M. R. Niehoff, ‘Jewish Identity and Jewish Mothers: Who was a Jew according to Philo?,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. In contrast to studies focusing upon the ‘Jewishness’ of Philo’s thought, Niehoff argues that Philo’s Jewish identity should be understood within the social context of Roman Egypt. Claiming that descent from a Jewish mother was important to Philo, Niehoff uses this issue to illustrate Roman influence on Philo’s position. Roman practice emphasized the civil status of the mother—in addition to that of the father—in determining the status of the offspring. Like- wise, Philo considered a child to be Jewish only if both the mother and the father were Jews. To support her argument, Niehoff discusses Philo’s interpre- tation of Hagar, Bilhah, Zilpah, and Tamar, contending that he viewed them as non-Israelite women who became Jews. Accordingly, except for Hagar, whose menial status kept her son from being considered legitimate, Philo conferred legitimate status on the offspring of the other women, who had achieved proper status, both religious and social.

Popa, ‘Functions of the Typos Imagery in Philo of Alexan- dria,’ Ancient Philosophy  Special Issue: Representations of Philosophy in the Classical World () –. Although scholars such as Dillon and Runia have briefly touched on the importance of the imagery of the mark or seal (τupsilonacuteπ ς) in Philo, they have not discussed it in any detail. Popa argues that the idea is derived from Mid- dle Platonism and ultimately goes back to Platonic texts in the Timaeus and the Theaetetus, but that Philo uses it much more often and also significantly expands its scope. On the basis of a discussion of central texts, found mainly in Opif., he concludes that Philo’s use of τupsilonacuteπ ς imagery accomplishes three main functions. () Just like the less sophisticated ε8κ&lt;ν imagery, it under- scores significant similarities between a model and its replica. () It neatly marks the ontological difference between a paradigm and the corresponding physical objects. () This difference is not regarded as a simple sequence in the hierarchy of the cosmos, but rather as a dynamic relationship in which the pattern informs and governs its material image. Indeed, it may be claimed that this τupsilonacuteπ ς imagery epitomizes what is distinctive in Philo’s metaphysics. (DTR) 9964. R. Radice, ‘Modelli di creazione in Filone di Alessandria,’ in C.

In this article Radicemakes clear the unity ofmethod and content inOpif. and Leg., locating both treatises in the development of the allegory of the creation in seven days. In his judgment the creation which is described in Leg. should be located on the seventh day and should rightly be regarded as the creation of values.The fact that God proceeds to this creative activity precisely on the day of his ‘rest’, is meant to indicate to human beings the superiority of contemplative activity in comparison with practical activity in accordance with a typical Greek attitude. From the theological point of view this unified interpretation of the two treatises would confirm the mixed nature of the divine action, which is ex nihilo for the conceptual aspect and demiurgic for the material aspect. In a previous work (RRS ) Radice has definied this creative activity as ‘foundational’, i.e. creation of the foundations of reality. (RR) 9965. G. J.

It describes the process whereby Stoic philosophy absorbed cosmological and psychological doctrines fromPlato’s Timaeus, which then sub- sequently influenced the way that the Platonic dialogue was read in later antiq- uity.

Chapter three is entitled Philo Judaeus: immanence and transcendence (pp. –). It revisits themes already discussed in RRS  and . The first part of the chapter discusses background issues, such as the relation between Stoicism and Platonism in Philo’s thought. The second part examines the doc- trines of God and the principles of the universe with an emphasis on impor- tant texts in Opif. The third part focuses on psychological themes and especially the relation between cosmology and the structure of the human soul. Reviews: A. P. Bos, SPhA  () –; P.-H.

The article studies the origins and development of the term and concept of the κ σμ ς ν ητ ς in the period from Plato to Plotinus. It chiefly concentrates on the appearance and use of the specific term, but this involves studying the concept as well. Although the expression does not appear as such in Plato, its origins can clearly be traced to various Platonic passages in theRepublic,Timaeus and Philebus. The earliest extant author to use it explicitly is Philo, in whose works we find at least  instances. These references go in a number of different directions, being either related to cosmological or epistemological concerns. Thereafter the author discusses usage by other st century sources such as Timaeus Locrus and the doxographer Aëtius, nd century Middle Platonist authors, Alexandrian Church Fathers such as Clement and Origen, and finally Plotinus. At the end of the article five ‘modest conclusions’ are drawn. ()Theuse of the term is less frequent than one might think. () Historically the strongest connections are linked to the concept of the model in the Timaeus. () There is also a tradition connecting the term with epistemological doctrines. () In pre- Plotinian texts little overt reflection is found on the contents and organization of the intelligible cosmos, but this complacency is broken in Plotinus. () The evidence available makes it risky to speak of a ‘brief history’ at all. (DTR) 9967. D. T. Runia, Filone di Alessandria nella prima letteratura cris- tiana: Uno studio d’insieme, a cura di R.

Runia, ‘Philo of Alexandria and theGreekHairesis-model,’ Vigiliae Christianae  () –. The article undertakes to examine the extent to which Philo made use of the Greek notion of αJρεσις in his presentation of Mosaic thought. First the term itself with its wide range ofmeanings is examined. It is then argued that a distinct model of the hairesis was prevalent in the Greek intellectual world from the nd century b.c.e. to the th century c.e. This model is articulated in terms of seven features, the most important of which is that a hairesis is not a philosophical school in the sense of an institution, but rather represents a school of thought, towhich one owed loyalty, but fromwhich one couldmove away. AlthoughPhilo in fact seldom uses the term, the model outlined is in fact very relevant to the way he presents the ‘school ofMoses’, even if he certainly does not take over all its aspects. This can be shown when the seven features of the Greek model outlined earlier are compared with the Philonic material. Why then does Philo actually use the term so little? It is suggested that this has to do with the apologetic focus of his portrayal of Judaism, which emphasizes unity in contrast to the dissension that marks Greek thought. (DTR) 9969. D. T.

This review article examines what the monumental edition in four volumes of the Catena on Genesis produced by Françoise Petit (cf. RRS , , ) can tell us about the presence of Philo in that work. It emerges that he is directly or indirectly cited in  lemmata. These excerpts are analysed in a database on the basis of six criteria: the number in Petit’s edition, the Genesis text being commented on, the source of the excerpt in Philo’s QG, the length of the excerpt, the title used to describe Philo (whether name only, or Philo the Hebrew or Philo the Bishop) and the method of exegesis used. This evidence allows some conclusions to be drawn about the usage of Philonic material in the compendium. (DTR) 9970. D. T. Runia, ‘The Pre-Christian Origins of Early Christian Spirituality,’ in P.

But this does not mean that they did not have antecedent traditions which exerted a strong influence on them. The article first examines the spirituality of the Greek philosophical tradition. It then turns to the tradition of Hellenistic Judaism and explores the characteris- tic spirituality found there. In the third and final part it investigates how these two traditions actually make their presence felt in early Christian spirituality, using the ‘New song of the Logos’ in the opening chapter of Clement’s Protrep- ticus as an example. In the section devoted to Philo’s spirituality (pp. –) particular attention is paid to the views of Marguerite Harl and David Winston. (DTR) 9971. K.-G.

In this printed version of a lecture delivered to a Finnish Classics society, Sandelin briefly presents Philo’s attitudes to the Graeco-Roman culture of his time as exhibited by his attitudes to four aspects of this culture: the aesthetic, the religious, the intellectual and the political. Philo describes several aspects of the aesthetic in positive terms, but his own attitudes are more ambiguous; con- cerning religion, the author finds that Philo’s use of mystery terms demonstrate more that hewaswell versed in the culture of his time than a reflection of his own religious praxis. Furthermore, Philo is a person of considerable intellectual sta- tus and learning, and demonstrates great respect for philosophers such as Plato: he has a dualistic anthropology, he uses allegory in his expositions of Scripture, and he is influenced by Stoic traditions. Philo’s political views are demonstrated by his attitudes to the Roman prefect Flaccus, he criticizes Caligula, but praises Augustus for his reign of order. Hence Philo is presented here as one who tries to integrate while trying to keep a critical distance from his contemporary Graeco- Roman culture. (TS) 9972. P. Schäfer, Guideofobia.

Popularizing the results of his earlier research (cf. esp. RRS , , and above ) the author gives an introduction to Philo and his work, showing his relevance for the theology of the New Testament. It is this universalistic, philo- sophical line of Jewish theology which is at the roots of Hellenistic Christianity. Sellin explains Philo’s allegorical method, his view of the Logos, with whom the pious can identify, and his position between Greek philosophy and Jewish piety. He notes three points which cannot be deduced from Greek philosophy: () immortality of the soul by God’s inspiration, () a holistic anthropology, () the negative theology, which is based on OT motifs. Finally, Sellin sketches Philo’s influence on NT Christology (through Philo it becomes understandable that a man is the cosmic Logos), the Pauline ‘mystic’ of Christ and other NT subjects. (DZ) 9976.

For the sequence of quotations of the Torah and secondary texts from outside the Pentateuch he recalls similar procedures in Philo. He then elucidates the terminology for the exegetical method applied here and draws some parallels to Philo. Philo also has an interpretation of πα 9ειν (Gen : f.) in malam partem, presupposed in Gal :. The localization of Mount Sinai in Arabia (v. a) is confirmed by Philo, Mos. .. For the equation of Hagar with this mountain an explanation via the Philonic etymology of Hagar and the etymology found in Exod : LXX is suggested. Especially Philo’s allegorical exegesis of Hagar and Sarah and their sons provides an analogy to Gal :–. He, too, illustrates with the story two types of men, not simply identical with Israel and the pagan peoples. Like Paul, Philo stresses the supernatural birth of Isaac, which is contrasted with the bastard origin of Ishmael. Both dwell on the free state of Sarah.Thus, Philo at least indirectly attests the difference between a spiritual and a natural relation to God. (DZ) 9977. F. Siegert and J. de Roulet, Pseudo-Philon.

The Jewish homilies contained in this volume have been transmitted under the name of Philo, but are certainly not authentically his and also cannot be attributed to another Ps.Philo, the author of the Biblical Antiquities. The author of these works is probably a contemporary of Philo, earlier than the Jew referred to by Celsus. Alexandria is the most likely Sitz im Leben of these writings. Frequent reference is made to Philo’s genuine writings in the Introduction and the notes to the text. (JR) 9978. G. E. Sterling, ‘Recherché or Representative? What is the Relationship between Philo’s Treatises and Greek-speaking Judaism?,’ The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. In this article the author examines two questions: () were Philo’s writings read by Jewish and pagan authors in antiquity? () are there thematic par- allels between Philo and other Jewish works? To answer these questions the author compares Philo with Jewish works written in Greek outside Alexandria and with a few pagan authors. The following works and authors, arranged geo- graphically, are involved in the research: Cleodemus Malchas,The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Enoch, Baruch, Egyptian Sibylline Oracles, Eupolemus, Lives of the Prophets, Sibylline Oracle , Justus of Tiberias, Maccabees, Hellenis- tic Synagogue Prayers, Numenius of Apamea, Celsus, Heliodorus Aethiopica, Plutarch, Caecilius of Calcate, Ps.Longinus On the Sublime, Josephus, and Plot- inus. The author observes some overlaps between Philo and Enoch, The Tes- tament of Joseph and Hellenistic Synagogue prayers in themes such as cos- mology, ethics and anthropology. Cleomedes, Eupolemus, and Justus repre- sent Jewish apologetic traditions, which Philo also clearly knows. Three pagan authors from Syria may have known some of Philo’s treatises: the philosopher </page> <page sequence="102">  part two Numenius of Apameia, the opponent of Christianity Celsus, and Heliodorus, who in his Aethiopica quotes Philo verbatim. From the authors working in Rome, Ps.Longinus is indebted to Philo, Josephus has read Philo’s Opif., and Plotinus also knows, directly or indirectly, Philo’s writings. The author’s general conclusion is that ‘there is evidence to suggest that some of Philo’s treatises began circulating in Egypt, Syria, and Romewithin Jewish and pagan circles during the first and second centuries c.e.’ (p. ). (ACG) 9979. G. E. Sterling, ‘ ‘The School of Sacred Laws’: the Social Setting of Philo’s Treatises,’ Vigiliae Christianae  () –. Using philosophical schools as a model, Sterling argues that Philo probably taught students either in his home or in a privately owned structure. School settings depend upon a tradition of learning, and that Philo worked within such a tradition seems probable, based upon his explicit references to other exegetes, the likelihood that he relied upon earlier sources, and the similarity of themes and discussions in related Jewish and Christian literature. Philo himself uses vocabulary referring to synagogues as schools and to various ideas or groups— especially the Therapeutae and Essenes—as reflecting or constituting schools of thought. Also, in Anim. , Lysimachus, Philo’s great-nephew, addresses Philo as if Philo were his teacher within a formal school setting. Also relevant is that Philo’s commentaries may belong to a school tradition, as suggested by such features as their focus upon a specific text, discussion of the text on different levels, and incorporation of several points of view. Philo must have had a library comprising his own works and those of others, which was probably preserved by one or more of his disciples. (EB) 9980. H.

The article investigates Philo’s use of the rare term γupsilonacuteνανδρ ς in the context of recent scholarship on ancient male writers’ concerns about female homoeroti- cism in the early Principate. In contrast to other classical Greek sources, which seem to use the word as a synonym of  νδρ γυν ς, Philo appears to use γupsilonacuteναν- δρ ς to refer to women who usurp the sexual role preserved for men. Philo, like Paul and Ps.Phocylides, confirms that the increasing male concern about female homoeroticism in early Judaism occurs not only as late as rabbinic literature, but clearly has its roots as far back as the first century c.e.

In a lengthy excursus the author of this habilitation thesis (Erlangen ) gives a detailed survey of the portrayal of Philo in the works of Eusebius. Besides his relevance for Jewish historiography, the writings of the Alexandrian author are cited at length in his Praeparatio evangelica andHistoria ecclesiastica. Philo is significant especially for his exegetical contribution and because of his methodological approaches. Eusebius naturally underlines the Platonic doctrine of the Logos, which he widely adopts. For the Christian reader the selection of the citations suggest a Christian understanding of the doctrine about the ‘second cause’. Finally, the ascetical living community of the Therapeutae is declared to be a proto-Christian community. Nevertheless, it is important to note that for Eusebius Philo always remains the highly esteemed ‘Hebrew’ and ‘Jew’ and is not converted into a Christian himself. (GS) 9985. G. M.

Argall pursues the suggestion of Morton Smith that a common Hellenis- tic Jewish source about the Essenes underlies Prob. – and Ant. .– rather than that Josephus drew upon Philo. He also posits that this source and Pliny may both make use of a core of older material found in the work of Marcus Agrippa. Although R. Bergmeier had proposed an outline of such a source based upon additional passages from Philo and Josephus, Argall sug- gests that the focus should be limited to the two passages mentioned in the title of his article. This allows him to argue that the Hellenistic source encom- passed the additional topic of sacrifice, which Philo and Josephus each men- tion and address in their own ways. Argall provides a list of topoi covered in the hypothetical common source, including the older material used also by Pliny. He notes that Philo and Josephus discuss these topoi in the same order; that their common source had inserted a moralizing commentary, e.g., about the injustice of slavery; and that this list of topics is shorter than Bergmeier’s because Argall includes only those topics mentioned in both Prob. and Ant.

This work, which undertakes to reexamine the problem of original sin with reference to the history of ideas, represents a complete and very well docu- mented study. It contains a chapter devoted to Philonic views on the subject, a first version of which appeared earlier in  (see RRS , p. ). Philo’s views depend on the manner in which he understands the revealed doctrine of the creation of the world and of humankind. In first presenting these themes, the author highlights the dualistic emphasis of Philo’s anthropology. This dualism, even though it is mitigated by amonotheistic faith in creation, nevertheless does remains a dualism, situating the origin of evil in the sensible, corporeal and ter- restrial world. A pessimistic view of humankind is the result. Human beings are bornmarked by a ‘congenital stain’.They are driven to wickedness by a dominant evil tendency within their make-up. (JR) 20003. P. J.

In particular he points to the lack of parallels in the Hebrew Scriptures with regard to Abraham receiving the spirit. However, authors like Paul did not only draw upon the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures, but on traditions of exegesis of these Scriptures. Hence the author further argues that Paul probably had access to traditions that associated Abraham and the spirit. He briefly discusses Philo’s Virt. –, Ps.Philo De Sampsone  and Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael Beshallah .–, arguing that these provide interesting parallels to the emphasis on the spirit inGal :–.

This study seeks to locate some aspects of Paul’s mission and theology within the framework of expectations related to Israel and the nations in Early Judaism. In this endeavour Philo of Alexandria plays a major role in the Jewish texts the author draws upon. Central topics in his presentation are: the univer- sal Reign of the Messiah; the eschatological role of the Law; the blessings of Israel as shared with the Gentiles in the end-time; the conversion of the Gen- tiles; and the restoration of Israel. On this basis the author suggests it is pos- sible to see Paul’s view on the relationship between Israel and the nations as a redefinition of Jewish hopes, and Paul as Israel’s eschatological apostle.

Berchman deals with the issue of Philo and philosophy. Many modern schol- ars—for example Nikiprowtzky, Winston, Runia, Radice—consider Philo to be not a philosopher but an exegete. Berchman opposes this view, arguing that philosophy can be found in Philo’s connection of allegory and rhetoric. Furthermore, it is Philo’s aim to connect Jewish and Greek wisdom. Berchman sums up Philo’s philosophy in threewords: () atomism, () fundamentalism, () criticism. () Philo employs philosophical ideas, but never wrote a philosophical commentary. () His borrowings of philosophical ideas are stripped of their technical philosophical value. () His criticism does not consist in evaluating ideas, but he considers their meaning only within the exegetical context. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="106">  part two 20006. G.

In recent years increasing attention has been paid to the interpretive activ- ity in Philo’s work Against Flaccus. The present study reviews the studies of M.A. Kraus, M.Meiser and R. Alston, focusing on how they may contribute to a holistic perspective on this work and on the relationship between Philo’s inter- pretations and historical events. In the final part the author elaborates on his own view of Jewish laws and customs in community conflict as interpreted by Philo, and at the end offers some observations on comparative material, briefly focusing on Maccabees, Rev  and Acts :–. According to Borgen points of similarity between Flacc. and other writings of Philo support the view that Philo applied Pentateuchal principles, as understood and formulated by him, to his interpretation of historical events.

In Opif. – Philo rejects the view, attributed to the Chaldeans, that the universe itself is divine. Bos calls this view ‘cosmic theology’. Philo, by way of contrast, does not regard God as part of the cosmos but as a transcendent, meta- cosmic principle. Important in Philo’s theology is the difference between God himself on the one hand and God’s Logos and his powers on the other. God himself is the creator of the universe but he uses his powers as an instrument to create and to rule his creation. In Abr. Philo narrates that Abraham is aroused from the Chaldean mentality and discovers the existence of a transcendent God. The image of the awakening is borrowed from Aristotle. Bos argues that Philo is not a true Platonist, but rather a Platonist in the image of Aristotle. Philo’s theology is inspired by the Aristotelian treatise De Mundo (which Bos regards as authentic). Finally, it is argued that Philo’s meta-cosmic theology is a source of inspiration for Gnostic ideas. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="107"> critical studies   20009. A. P.

In his treatment of Philo’s philosophical spirituality, Bos discusses three texts: Opif. –, Abr. – and Congr. , –, . In Opif. Philo, rejecting the cosmic theology of the Chaldeans, opts for a meta-cosmic theology: God is not part of the universe, but is transcendent. In Abr. Philo narrates that Abraham awakes from the Chaldean state of mind and gains the insight that there exists a transcendent God. In the last text Philo interprets the allegory of Hagar and Sarah in terms of preparatory general education and virtue. Explaining this interpretation, Bos affirms that Philo brings a Greek philosophical message and fails to do justice to the biblical text. Finally, some remarks are presented on Philo’s dualistic anthropology, based on Gen :. (ACG) 20010. S. Breslauer, ‘Philosophy in Judaism: Two Stances,’ in J. Neusner and A. J. Avery-Peck (edd.), The Blackwell Companion to Judaism (Oxford ) –. With regard to the relationship between Judaism and philosophy, one stance views the two as identical, while another sees philosophy as external to Judaism. This article surveys the ancient, medieval, and modern periods and focuses on a representative of each stance within the different periods. Issues com- mon to all periods include ‘an interpretation of scripture, a defense of the unity of reality, and a justification for Jewish practice’ (p. ). In the ancient period, Philo represents the stance that philosophy is external to Judaism and Josephus represents the position that Judaism in itself is philosophical. Believ- ing that Judaism carries a universal message, Philo uses allegorical interpreta- tion to expound upon the philosophical ideas embedded in the Bible. Influ- enced by Plato, he envisions an ‘emanational system,’ in which the Logos is a link between the corporeal and intellectual realms. To grasp the philosophi- cal teachings of Jewish laws, Philo believes it is essential to observe these laws. (EB) 20011. F. Calabi, ‘Galeno e Mosè,’ Rivista di storia della filosofia  () –. The article takes its starting-point from the passage in Galen (De usu partium ., .– Kühn) in which he criticizes Moses and Epicurus with regard to their views on providence. Whereas Epicurus denies that there is a providen- tial order in nature, Moses does admit its existence, but also retains the possi- bility that God can intervene at any moment to modify that order by acting in a manner that is arbitrary and lacking regularity. The author seeks to determine what Galen is referring to when he speaks about Moses: does he have a particu- lar author in mind, e.g. Philo, when he recalls the Bible here, or does he cite an </page> <page sequence="108">  part two opinion which was widely held about Jewish thought? Referring to the inter- pretation put forward by R. Radice, she notes that certain aspects of Galen’s statement could make one think of Philo, e.g. the principle of the divine word, the absoluteness of God, divine omnipotence, the simultaneous nature of cre- ation. If, however, in the Galenic passage certain aspects appear to be reducible to Philo, others seems to recall the biblical text of Genesis more directly. Cal- abi’s hypothesis is that Galen, when speaking about Moses, does not distinguish precisely between the views of Jews and Christians, but on the contrary tends to assimilate them. Invoking other authors, in particular Celsus and Irenaeus, she puts forward the view that Galen’s reference is composite, consisting of Genesis, Philo and Christian authors, all seen in a unitarian manner as presenting ‘the view of Moses’.

Schofield (edd.), The Cambridge His- tory of Greek and Roman Political Thought (Cambridge ) –, esp. –. As a historiographical category Middle Platonism is somewhat problematic. The authors of most interest during this period in the area of political thought are Philo and Plutarch. Both had active involvement in politics but their theo- retical reflections are of limited importance for their thought.This is because the programmatic and utopian aspects of Plato’s political legacy could not be influ- ential in the differing political circumstances of their time. A brief account of Philo and his political ideas follows. The paradigms of kingship for him are the biblical figures of Joseph and Moses. The principal themes of Philo’s teachings on politics, rule and kingship, are rooted in Greek traditions, but for realization of his ideal he looks to Judaism, inspired by what he read in its scriptures.

In this study it is argued that the reliability of the Letter of Aristeas regarding the history of the Greek translation of the Pentateuch has since the th century been discredited for no good reason. The author establishes the date of the translation as  b.c.e., deducing this date from the evidence found in the Fathers of the Church who preserved eleven relevant dates. Analysis of the accounts of the translation in Philo (Mos. .–) and Josephus (notably Ant. .–) leads to the conclusion that both ‘are based on Aristeas, and that changes made by each author to Aristeas are a reflection of their opinion on the divinity of the text’ (p. ). Philo, in his overriding desire to convince his reader of the sanctity of the text, minimizes the role of theGreeks and in so doing completely distorts the account of the translation (p. ). We can probably learn next to nothing from Philo and Josephus about the factual history of the translation (p. ), but the accounts of both authors ‘suggest that they are part </page> <page sequence="109"> critical studies   of a persistent debate within Hellenistic Judaism concerning the question of the sancitity of the Pentateuch in Greek, of which Philo provides the earliest proof ’ (p. ).

Brooke (ed.), Jewish Ways of Reading the Bible (Oxford ) –. Collins defends the basic premise of the Letter of Aristeas that theGreek trans- lation of the Pentateuch was initiated by Demetrius of Phalerum, librarian to Ptolemy II Philadelphus, for acquisition in the royal library. While acknowledg- ing that not all aspects of the Letter are true, she selects details of the Letter which, she claims, challenge the current scholarly consensus—held for only two hundred years—that the Jews themselves initiated this translation because they no longer knew Hebrew. Although Aristeas relied upon an earlier source, which contained hints of Jewish opposition to the translation, by his time the transla- tion was viewed as divinely inspired, and he adapted the earlier source to con- form to the later view. Philo ‘continued the fight to prove the divine origins of the translation’ (p. ), consistent with his purpose to spread knowledge of Judaism among theGreeks, and he omitted any account of Jewish opposition to the trans- lation. Josephus, who did not believe in the divine inspiration of the translation, follows the account of Aristeas in large part. Later Jewish sources expressed very negative attitudes toward the Greek translation, presumably because it was used against them. (EB) 20015. D.

Beginning with a bibliographic overview, this essay explores how the alle- gorical readers Philo and Origen used the metaphor of body and soul in rela- tion to text and meaning. Because both writers were so strongly influenced by Plato, it is ironic that Plato himself rejected ‘as philosophically pointless’ the practice of reading poetic narratives allegorically (p. ). Dawson adduces three Philonic examples that show how Philo highlights ‘the positive and productive interaction of mind and body’ (p. ). One example (QG .) emphasizes the epistemological importance of sense-perception and likewise of the narrative aspect, or body, of the text. Another example (Migr. –) presents the text as ‘recorded law,’ whose meaning is discerned through physical performance. The third example (Contempl. ) underscores that one arrives at the inner meaning, or soul, of Scripture only through its outward, literal text, or body. Origen, who opposed excessive literalism, posited three levels of meaning of the text, using the metaphor of body, soul, and spirit. As one progresses in understanding, ‘the body becomes more and more spiritualized, but it is never simply left behind’ (p. ). (EB) </page> <page sequence="110">  part two 20016. G.

Etienne, ‘Réflexion sur l’ apostasie de Tibérius Julius Alex- ander,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The exceptional cursus honorum of Philo’s nephew, the Roman knight Tibe- rius Julius Alexander, has been the object of numerous investigations and stud- ies. Yet historians have often failed to reflect on the validity of the accusation of apostasy with which he has been carelessly charged. Further, the majority of modern authors rely on the testimonium of Flavius Josephus (AJ .) with- out expressing the least suspicion in respect to it. The personality of Tiberius Julius Alexander and the events of his prestigious career agree with this state- ment of the case since, at first glance, everything leads us to think that he had to renounce his ancestral religion. The innovative aspect of the analysis given in this article lies in the fact that an investigation of all the elements of the life of Tiberius Julius Alexander—not just the statement of Josephus—leads us to think that he had to apostatize or stand in opposition to the Jewish law. It is, however, imperative to determine which elements actually merit consideration and to jus- tify their selection. The essay does this by setting out the concept of apostasy, the evidence of the two Philonic treatises that involve Tiberius Julius Alexander, the </page> <page sequence="111"> critical studies   evidence of his career, and finally how all of this evidence affects our understand- ing of Josephus’ statement.

Förster, ‘The Exegesis of Homer and Numerology as a Method for Interpreting the Bible in theWritings of Philo of Alexandria,’ in G. J. Brooke (ed.), Jewish Ways of Reading the Bible (Oxford ) –. Greek interpreters preserved the central role of Homer in their educational system by interpreting his work allegorically to bring his message up to date. Some interpreters also applied different kinds of Pythagorean arithmological exegesis. We have evidence of this kind of exegesis from various writings, includ- ing those of Nicomachus of Gerasa and Anatolius, Ps.Plutarch and excerpts in Stobaeus, and various Scholia on Homer. Philo occasionally quotes lines of the Iliad in providing arithmological interpretations of the Bible as well as in other contexts. Although the results of his exegesis differ from those of other known arithmological interpreters of Homer, his exegetical method is similar to theirs, and it is likely that he was familiar with the traditions upon which they drew.

The radical opposition in Augustine between love of god and self-love is traced back to Plato and Aristotle. In his exegesis of Exod : (QE .ff.) Philo underlines the necessity of divine grace to overcome the destructive forces in the soul. In Sacr. – he shows how victory over self-love is possible. This vice is inherited and corresponds in that respect to original sin. More directly, however, Augustine depends onPlotinus. To declare the abuse of human freedom the cause of all evil does not resolve the problem of theodicy. (DZ) 20022. J. de Garay, ‘Bárbaros e infieles en el pensamiento de Filón de Alejandría,’ in J.

The author emphasizes the novelty of Philo’s thought with respect to the theory of knowledge. Going beyond the idea of an appropriation on the part of a subject that reaches the identity with the object, Philo proposes a concept of knowledge which extends towards hearing and hoping, i.e. not far from the modern proposal of Levinas. Understanding occurs in intellectual attention, but also in the presence of otherness. It reaches a higher degree in the recognition of the difference between being and not being. (JPM) 20024. A. C.

Philo’s eschatology is discussed under three headings: () individual eschatol- ogy; () national eschatology; () cosmic eschatology. () Important in Philo is the distinction between the rational and the irrational soul. Whereas the ratio- nal soul is immortal, the irrational soul, from which the passions originate, is mortal and corruptible. At death the rational soul can escape from the body. () According to P. Borgen, Philo claims a national role for the Jews: they have the cosmic divine law which will establish universal peace. Grabbe is not con- vinced by Borgen’s interpretation. () Philo’s description of a paradise in Praem. – has been interpreted as referring to the age to come.

This is the reason that messianism represents no more than a marginal part of his preoccupations. Apart from Divine providence, to which he attaches great importance, he looks above all to Rome when evoking the security and earthly prosperity of the Jews. The particular concern that Providence shows towards Israel testifies to her election. A sign of this election is the observance of the Law. This gives Israel a separate state in history, because she is not subject to its ‘cyclical revolutions’. (JR) 20028. C. T. R. Hayward, ‘Philo, the Septuagint of Genesis :– and the Name ‘Israel’: Fighting the Passions, Inspiration and the Vision of God,’ Journal of Jewish Studies  () –. Philo’s understanding of the etymology of Israel as ‘[the] one who sees God’ occurs frequently throughout his work and appears to derive from an earlier tradition. Because the Septuagint is central to Philo’s exegesis, Hayward explores how Philo uses the LXX in relation to his discussions of Israel. Although Philo does not use the LXX to explain the link between Israel and ‘seeing God,’ he draws from the LXX several other themes, which he develops in connection with Israel.These themes include the portrayal of Jacob as a wrestler and athlete; Israel’s name change as ‘a blessing uttered in prophecy’ (p. ); and, especially, Israel’s role as a ‘boundary figure’ between heavenly and earthly things—a role similar to that played by the Logos, the high priest, and the firstman. In addition, Philo uses the episode at Bethel (Gen ) rather than the one at Penuel (Gen ) to illustrate the experience of Israel as ‘the one who sees God.’ Underlying these various complex associations may be an understanding of divine inspiration, which Philo himself may have experienced. In turn, this experiencemay account </page> <page sequence="114">  part two for his ‘evident fascination’ with Israel and the vision of God and ‘his expressed wish that others, too, might share such a privilege’ (p. ).

Luttikhuizen (ed.), TheCreation ofMan andWoman: Interpretations of the BiblicalNarratives in Jewish and Christian Traditions, Themes in Biblical Narrative: Jewish and Christian Traditions  (Leiden ) –. Philo’s interpretations of the creation of man and woman, which rely upon two contradictory biblical accounts, are themselves complex and inconsistent. In one set of interpretations—classified here as ‘anthropos undivided and di- vided’—Philo first posits creation of an exemplary human being, modeled upon the noetic world. Changing the biblical wording of Gen :, he declares this )ν ρωπ ς to be neither male nor female, i.e. undivided. In another interpre- tation, based upon Gen :, Philo sees the creation of a human who could be male or female. Elsewhere, Philo modifies these interpretations in ways that produce various inconsistencies. In another set of interpretations of passages which come after the creation story—classified here as ‘anthropos divided: man and woman’—Philo moves away from the cosmological to the anthropologi- cal realm. Here he leaves his ‘generic, non-gendered concept of anthropos’ and uses allegorical interpretation to present man as mind and woman as sense- perception becoming entangled with sensual pleasure. Both in his allegorical interpretations and elsewhere in his works, Philo speaks of women in very nega- tive terms, preferringmale-oriented language to discuss the general human con- dition.

In the philosophical discourse of Deus , α8&lt;ν is not the life of God, as a double text emendation of this passage has led scholars to believe. And Philo’s exegesis of Exod :– inMut. as well as his comment on Prov :– in Ebr.  show that for Philo ‘the α8&lt;ν’ in the LXX correlates with the created world. (HMK) 20038. J.

(Wiesbaden ) –. Kügler here elaborates a chapter from his Habilitationsschrift (see above ). Philo inMos..– ascribes to Moses qualities well known from the Hellenistic royal ideology; themessianic-eschatological concept does notmatter for him. In allegorizing the conception of the mothers of the patriarchs (Cher. –) Philo is far away from theEgyptian-Hellenistic idea of a royal SonofGod. He sees in God, however, the true king who delegates his authority to the Logos, his firstborn Son. People who follow his direction and do what is good can be called Sons of God too (Spec. .). In Conf. – this sonship is mediated by the Logos as Image of God; he thus fulfills a similar soteriological function as the Egyptian king. In Philo’s image of the shadow (for the Logos cf. Leg. .) Egyptian traces are also detected. On the whole, political ideas are spiritualized; this however has political consequences in the critique of contemporaneous aspirations of emperors.

Evidence suggests, however, that the northern Mediter- ranean route was shorter, safer, and more comfortable than the way via Alexan- dria. It is also fairly well accepted that Agrippa left Italy in July and arrived in Alexandria in early August, but this dating does not accord with other events linked to the death of Gaius’ sister Drusilla in June. It is more likely that Agrippa set sail for Alexandria earlier in the spring, specifically to help the Jews in their struggle with the Greeks. His purpose would have been to obtain and convey to Gaius a letter from the Jews expressing their congratulations upon his accession and presenting their complaints against the Greeks. Because the Greeks feared the potential success of Agrippa’s intervention, his visit sparked their violence against the Jews. Philo’s explanation that Agrippa stopped in Alexandria because of Gaius’ advice was therefore provided to cover up the real intent behind his visit. (EB) 20040. A.

The main argument is the parallel at Ps.AristotleDeMelisso Xenophane Gorgia , a (=Xenophanes A DK). The comparison with children on the sea shore, drawn fromHomer,may also go back to Xenophanes. Both arguments can be well fitted into an understanding of Xenophanes’ theological argument.

Of Gideon’s campaigns (Judg :–:) Philo only mentions the destruction of the tower of Phanuel (Judg :–, , cf. Conf. –). Like the Tower of Babel, this tower represents impious pride which thinks it can conquer the skies in order to subdue intellectual values and subject them to the world of sensible reality, when in fact the celestial realities are inaccessible. To this pretension Gideon is opposed, whose name signifies ‘piracy’. He embodies the just person, ‘this pirate who maltreats injustice and incessantly seeks its death’. (JR) 20042. L. I.

In this second volumeof introductory portraits of ancient philosophers, Philo ranges between Cicero and Seneca. First his works are presented (Mos. is miss- ing). Then his attitude to philosophy is discussed. A conflict between his iden- tity as Jew and as philosopher cannot be denied. Through use of the allegor- ical method he wants to avoid contradictions in the revealed text. As for his philosophical presuppositions, Lévy points out that in Philo’s time the borders between the Platonists and the Stoics had become fluid, and that Eudorus estab- lished the absolute transcendence of the highest principle. In Philo, however, this transcendence is that of a person, not of an abstraction. His doctrine of the Logos allows Philo to maintain a God who is immanent to the world without being inconsistent regarding his transcendence. Finally, Philo’s ambivalent atti- tude towards scepticism and education as well as towards the passions is out- lined. (DZ) 20044. C. Lévy, ‘Philon d’Alexandrie et l’ épicurisme,’ in M. Erler (ed.),Epikureismus in der späten Republik und der Kaiserzeit, Philosophie der Antike  (Stuttgart ) –. Although the presence of Epicureanism in Philo’s œuvre is much less marked than that of Stoicism and Platonism, it is still a subject well worth studying. The author first discusses those passages, in Prov. ., Post.  and Aet.  where Epicurus and his school are mentioned explicitly. The main questions on which Philo strongly disagrees are those of divine providence in creation and the role of pleasure. Lévy is inclined to downplay the specific role of Epicurean themes in Alexander’s arguments in Book  of Prov. It would be a mistake to think that Philo’s references to the Epicurean doctrine of pleasure were wholly superficial. An analysis is given of the defence of pleasure that Philo places in the mouth of the serpent in Opif. –. This text puts forward the Epicurean theory of  8κε ωσις. The only other text with the same argument is found at Sextus Empiricus Adv. Eth. , but Philo’s presentation is in actual fact more precise and informative. Other texts in the Allegorical </page> <page sequence="119"> critical studies   Commentary confirm that his knowledge of Epicurean doctrines is far from superficial. It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that there is not a single point of confluence between Epicurus and Philo. Surprisingly his use of the theme of ‘cataleptic sensation’ is closer to the Garden than the Porch. He is prepared to accord an important role to sensation, but obviously can- not regard it as the supreme good. The author ends his article with three con- clusions. () Philo’s philosophical knowledge is much more precise and deep than often thought. () In relation to Hellenistic philosophies Philo has a dou- ble mission, to refute them when they deny transcendence, but at the same time use their views to bolster it. () Epicureanism paradoxically tries to unite all systems of dispersion in one thought. It thus symbolizes the very antithesis of monotheism. But it is possible that Philo did appreciate its quest for unity. (DTR) 20045. Y.

Liebes’ monograph presents a radical reevaluation of the status of the Jewish mystical treatise known as Sefer Yetsirah or, somewhat inadequately, the ‘Book of Formation.’ This small but enigmatic composition, which played a seminal role in the development of central components of Jewish mysticism in the Middle Ages, has been described as ‘layers of tradition woven together to form a collage of speculation on the process of divine creativity and the nature of what has been created’ (E. R. Wolfson p.  in the critical review article cited below). The claim of this book for the interests of the present audience lies precisely in its extreme argument for an early dating of the Sefer Yetsirah: in opposition to a consensus of scholarly opinion which sees the treatise as inherently tied to an early Islamic context, Liebes would assign the work to the end of the period of the Second Temple. The argument naturally turns to salient parallel material from the first century c.e., and there are extended discussions of presumed contacts between the mystical treatise and the Philonic corpus, especially with regard to the presentation of Abraham (pp. –, –, –), the Temple (pp. –) and messianic universalism (pp. –). In his concluding discussion of the date of Sefer Yetsirah (pp. –), Liebes emphasizes the extreme proximity of the worldviews of the author with those of Philo. Reviews: E. R.

The article poses the question: why does Philo refer so seldom to the syn- agogue? In fact almost all of his references to this institution occur in the two so-called historical treatises. Martin argues that the lack of references should not be taken to indicate a lack of interest. It may well be a consequence of the genre of most of Philo’s extant writings, as well as the fact that he just takes the syn- agogue for granted as a central institution of Alexandrian Jewish life. Although he expresses distaste for the common masses, Philo is nevertheless devoted to the maintenance of Jewish praxis, which includes the study and interpretation of scripture in a synagogue setting.Themost powerful evidence for the importance of the synagogue for Philo’s Judaism is probably his description of the practices of the community of the Therapeutae.

An Investigation into the Relationship between the Institutions of the Greco- Roman Diaspora Synagogue and the Jerusalem Temple in the Late Second Temple Judaism: Philo—a Case Study (diss. University of Melbourne ). In this Melbourne dissertation it is argued that an inherent tension existed between the institutions of the Graeco-Roman Diaspora synagogue and the Jerusalem Temple in the pre- c.e. period. The relationship between these two institutions was characterised by an inherent ambiguity, thus contrasting with attempts to demonstrate the existence of either a complementary rela- tionship or an overt opposition between the Temple and synagogue in this period. This ambiguous relationship derives from the fact that both institu- tions functioned as loci of divine worship, yet each embodied quite distinct constructions of the locus of sanctity. A structuralist model of sacred spaces in Judaism is drawn upon in an attempt to describe these conceptions of the locus of sanctity and characterize their ambiguous relationship in first cen- tury Judaism. The relationship is placed in the context of the transition from a temple-centred locative worldview to an anthropocentric utopian worldview taking place in the religious thought of the Mediterranean world during this era which a number of scholars have proposed. Proceeding from a position admitting the existence of a plurality of Judaisms in the post-Maccabaean era, the writings of Philo of Alexandria are taken as a discrete body of evidence to serve as a case study to test the proposed hypothesis. It is shown that Philo betrays a notable tension in his thought concerning the relationship between the institutions of the Temple and the synagogue. While Philo vociferously defends the relevance of the Jerusalem Temple, examination of his exercises in idealizing speculation—his description of the life of the Therapeutic com- munity of Contempl. and his vision of the eschatological endtime—reveals that ultimately the Temple is irrelevant to the mode of spiritual worship, the life of the virtuous man, which he consistently and wholeheartedly advocates and </page> <page sequence="121"> critical studies   which is embodied in the life of the synagogue, a ‘school of virtue’. The Tem- ple retains relevance for Philo only insofar as it functions as a symbol of Jewish corporate identity in the Gentile Roman world. The notion of the ‘centrality’ of the Jerusalem Temple, commonly ascribed to the Judaisms of the late Sec- ond Temple period, is revealed to be a dubious and ill-defined concept. Some implications of the ambiguous relationship thus revealed for the issue of syn- agogues associated with Greek-speaking Diaspora communities in pre- c.e. Jerusalem (such as that of Acts ) are examined. (DTR; based on author’s sum- mary) 20049. A. M. Mazzanti, Art. ‘Filone di Alessandria,’ in A. Monaci Castagno (ed.), Origene Dizionario (Rome ) –. In the view of the author ‘the methodological and conceptual influence which Philo exerted on Origen was noteworthy’ and concerns above all the problem of the allegorical interpretation, especially the corporeal (i.e. literal or historical), the psychical (i.e. moral) and the spiritual (i.e. mystical) exegesis of the Bible (p. ). Mazzanti recounts in brief terms the views held by scholars on this issue. Other points of contact between Philo and Origen are the dominance of Platonic themes and the figure of the Logos. Origen’s anthropology also seems to be influenced by the Alexandrian, and especially the allegory of the human being created in the image and the human being formed from the earth. (RR) 20050. H. Najman, ‘The Writings and Reception of Philo of Alexan- dria,’ in T. Frymer-Kensky, D. Novak andM. Signer, (edd.), Christian- ity in Jewish Terms (Boulder ) –. As a Jew who wrote before Judaism and Christianity parted ways but whose writingswere preserved byChristians, Philo offers a unique opportunity to study links between the two traditions. Influenced by the universalist concerns of Greek philosophy and aided by allegorical interpretation, Philo presented Bibli- cal figures like Moses and Abraham as paradigms, and he explained the Mosaic laws as embodiments of the universal, unwritten law of nature. Philo upheld, however, both the particularity of the law for the Jews and the need for obedience to the law. After the decline of the Alexandrian Jewish community, his works were preserved by Clement and Origen in the nd century c.e., who applied Philo’s universalizing interpretations to suit Alexandrian Christians. To main- tain the distinctiveness of Judaism, the rabbis shunned the universalizing ten- dencies found in Philo, although shared exegetical traditions can be found in rabbinic and Philonic works. Some later Jewish philosophers addressed issues similar to those raised by Philo, but universalizing tendencies were often con- troversial also among later Jews. Study of Philo can help Christians appreciate particularistic aspects of Jewish law and interpretation and can help Jews appre- ciate the universality of the divine-human encounter emphasized by Christians.

Kottek andM.Horstmanshoff (edd.), From Athens to Jerusalem: Medicine in Hellenized Jewish Lore and in Early Christian Literature (Rotterdam ) –. Published in a volume recording the partial proceedings of a Symposium held in Jerusalem, the article concentrates almost exclusively on Philo’s treatise Anim. The disappearance of the original Greek text of the work is a great loss, since it makes it more difficult to determine Philo’s sources, but nevertheless it deserves careful study for the insights it yields on his views in the area of psychology. The paper examines how Philo interprets classical animal psychology through his presentation of Alexander’s case for animal rationality and his own rebuttal of that position. The question is not only important on theoretical grounds; it also has clear juridical implications, since Philo’s position entails that animals do not fall under the purview of human justice. When Alexander argues that animals outstrip humans in some attainments, this recalls what G. Boas has called ‘theriophily’. The author also notes that Philo, though plainly hostile to Alexander’s case, does not try to answer all the points that he makes, but rather resorts to generalizations and rhetorical effects.

Exegetische Studien zur Soteri- ologie und Mystik bei Philo von Alexandrien, Wissenschaftliche Unter- suchungen zum Neuen Testament . (Tübingen ). This dissertation is dedicated to the phenomenon of divine inspiration in Philo seen from a perspective of religious psychology (‘mysticism’). Against H. Jonas, who generalizes the model of prophetic ecstasy, Noack wants to show that inspiration does not necessarily exclude human ‘consciousness’. In introduc- tory remarks Philo is situated sociologically, and his writings are differentiated form-critically into three categories: the missionary writings (the Exposition of the Law together with the philosophical and historico-political treatises), the Quaestiones, and the Allegorical commentary. From each group Noack analyzes an exemplary text, enabling him to establish three types of ‘Gottesbewußtsein’. () Virt. – is a kind of encomium presenting Abraham as a model for proselytes with features of a ‘divine man’.Through inspiration he becomes a suc- cessful teacher of wisdom. He is also impressive in terms of bodily beauty. The contact with God has the effect of a holistic improvement which, however, does not persist. () In QE . the ascent of Moses is an allegory for the temporary ecstatic identity of the consciousness with God while the sensual world disap- pears. In contrast to Abraham’s case this does have an external manifestation. () InHer. – inspiration functions only as analogy for the non-ecstatic, persist- ing change of consciousness, the decision for a view of reality where everything depends upon God.This is conceived in dualistic terms, but acquires a new rela- tion to the sensual world. Noack also wants to read Her. – in the same vein. In prophetic ecstasy the mind is excluded only in so far as it insists on its </page> <page sequence="123"> critical studies   own absoluteness. In his final synthesis Noack tries to sharpen the soteriological profile of the three genres under consideration and even attempts to make some suggestions on their ‘Sitz im Leben’ and their chronological order.

In his comprehensive survey on the semantics of τupsilonacuteπ ς the author wants to resolve the contradiction that the term can signify ‘model’ as well as ‘image’. He therefore reduces its semantic content to ‘that what makes visible another thing or forms it’. Against the older work of L. Goppelt (, R-R ) he insists that the term is used without connotations of time and value. It expresses a relation, not an entity. This is evident also in Philo, where the Logos can be conceived as model of the earthly man as well as as image of the Creator. In this flexibility the author sees a difference to the Platonic ideas. He challenges the view of Goppelt (who relies among other things on a doubtful interpretation ofMos. .), that τupsilonacuteπ ς in Philo usually means the lesser image. Philo uses the concept in his cosmology, in his exposition of Scripture and in his doctrine of the soul. Here, the τupsilonacuteπ ι have an active character. In this connection, the ‘third type’ in Her.  is explained as model of the mind, not as imprint. Other passages which seem to contradict this view (the idols Leg. .f.;Mos. .) are interpreted in this sense, too. In an appendix he shows that Philo uses  ντ τυπ ς only in the classical sense of ‘resistant’. (DZ) 20055. A.

After a detailed discussion of the bib- lical concepts of Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee as described in Lev  (but see also Exod :– and Deut :–) and their historical realization, the author then analyses Philo’s treatment, both literal and allegorical, of these con- cepts. It is concluded that Philo defends the Jewish law and practice of Sabbath rest in the context of the fact that it was not well accepted in Greco-Roman society. Where he underlines the benefits of the Sabbath Year, he does not give enough evidence for us to conclude that in his time the law on the Sabbath Year was observed. Philo’s allegorical interpretation gives much importance to arith- mology and to a spiritual detachment from earthly matters in favour of pur- suit of knowledge and wisdom, while a social note of solidarity is also present: the ‘holy years’ restore the social and personal dignity of slaves and the poor.

Among other things, in their profound concern for biblical interpreta- tion, Kugel and Philo love to pose questions at the biblical text and then see what answers they can come up with. Further, they emphasize the centrality of exegetical traditions and thus are pluralist and inclusivist in their approaches. For both, ‘there is no single interpretation that represents the truth’ (p. ). (KAF) 20063. D. T. Runia, ‘Art. Philo theTheologian,’ in T.

Runia, ‘The Idea and theReality of theCity in theThought of Philo of Alexandria,’ Journal of the History of Ideas  () –. The theme of the paper is the conception of the city as a social and cultural phenomenon in Philo’s thought. As an inhabitant of Alexandria Philo was thoroughly immersed in urban life. But what were the views that he held on the nature of the city itself? Firstly Philo’s views on Alexandria itself are noted. He was clearly proud to be a citizen of this great metropolis, even though during his lifetime life became increasingly precarious for the Jewish community. Next the city is treated as a potent symbol of order.This is best illustrated by the beautiful image used at Opif. – to illustrate the process of creation. Further material on the city is found in Philo’s vast exegetical output, e.g. the allegorization of the passage in Genesis when Cain builds a city. The theme of the city is used to illustrate the inner workings of the human soul. Just as there are two kinds of </page> <page sequence="127"> critical studies   city, so there are two kinds of soul, one marked by order and virtue, the other by disorder and vice. In certain passages Philo also criticizes the city and praises solitude. This theme is also relevant to his idealized descriptions of two extra- urban communities, the Essenes and the Therapeutae. Finally the article briefly touches on the theme of Jerusalem as the idealized city. Philo is a distant ancestor of Augustine’s famous contrast between the city of God and the city of human beings. The articles ends with some conclusions. Philo is seen as ambivalent towards the city. He habitually makes three contrasts: between the ideal and the reality of the city, between the good and the bad city, and between city life and solitude. His thought represents a mixture of both classical and Judaic views. From a historical point of view his conception looks both backwards to the ideal of the classical polis and forwards to Christian views when the desert was to become like the city. (DTR) 20066. D. T. Runia, ‘Philo’s Longest Arithmological Passage:De opifi- ciomundi –,’ in L.-J. Bord andD.Hamidovic (edd.),De Jérusalem à Rome: mélanges offerts à Jean Riaud (Paris ) –. The article was written as a preliminary study for the author’s commentary on Opif. in the Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series (= ). The placement of such a long excursus on the hebdomad in Philo’s commentary on the Genesis creation account is quite remarkable and gives rise to two questions which are examined in the article. Firstly, what is the principle of organization that Philo uses to structure the excursus?The author first examines two structural analyses made by K. Staehle and R. Radice and finds them both defective. A structural analysis of the entire passage is given. It can be divided into two main parts, §§– and §§–. The chief difference between the two is that the former contains much arithmetical calculation involving the seven (e.g. four phases of the moon amounting to × =  days), whereas the latter only lists groups of seven things (e.g. seven planets, seven vowels). The latter part is well structured. The former part is much more difficult, with esp. the section §§– proving difficult to understand from a structural point of view. The author stresses the role that association plays in this section. It is possible to reconstruct Philo’s mode of thought, but the result is far from satisfying. In order to understand it the methods of ancient authors, who make use of excerpted material, need to be taken into account. The second question to be discussed is why the long excursus is so little related to the rest of the treatise. Partly this is explained by the emphasis that scripture places on the hebdomad, which Philo wishes to explain in philosophical terms, i.e. by emphasizing the special features of the number, rather than exegetically. Another factor is that Philo did not wish to emphasize the role of the hebdomad as completing the other six days, as he did in Spec. .–. The article closes by looking at the relationship between Judaism and Hellenism in the excursus. Although Hellenism predominates, there are a number of hints that reveal that the writer is Jewish. In some respects the excursus is reminiscent of Philo’s philosophical treatises. (DTR) </page> <page sequence="128">  part two 20067. D. L.

In a preliminary section this Habilitationsschrift compares the Johannine reciprocal formulas μ νειν and εKναι 'ν with various materials of the history of ancient philosophy and religion. Philo uses μ νειν to characterize the im- mutability of God. In particular he recognizes an indwelling of God, his Logos or his Pneuma in the human soul, although usually he cannot stay there for- ever (Gig. ). Reciprocity is never stated directly. The author wants to distin- guish these statements from prophetic inspiration through :κστασις and sub- stitution of the human mind. Reviews: G. Sellin, SPhA  () –. (DZ) 20069. M. B.

Philo belonged to two worlds, the Jewish and the Greek, ‘but he never felt quite at one with either’ (p. ). Although he believed that the highest truth could be found in Judaism alone, Philo remained outside the inner circle of rabbinic tradition and he wrote about Judaism ‘almost as a foreigner’ (p. ). Well aware of tensions between Jews and Greeks in Alexandria, Philo defended the Jews in his writings and hoped for a time of harmony among different peoples. His essays Flacc. and Legat.—summarized in detail in this article— are philosophical more than historical and are based upon the notion that God punishes the wicked and protects the Jews. (EB) 20070.

In a volume that focuses upon religious rivalries in Caesarea Maritima, the author introduces the example of Alexandria as a useful comparison. She discusses the two cities in terms of location and population, arguing that the </page> <page sequence="129"> critical studies   Alexandrian population of Hellenes, Egyptians, and Jews was more complex than the Casesarean population of Jews and non-Jews. She then summarizes details of the Alexandrian ethnic conflict of  c.e. and examines the compli- cated issue of 8σ π λιτε α, equality of civil rights. With very few exceptions, which included Philo and his brother Alexander, Jews were not citizens of Alexandria. They had a π λ τευμα, whose authority is not clear, and discus- sions of 8σ π λιτε α may reflect Jewish membership in the π λ τευμα rather than citizenship in Alexandria. As a source of information about Jewish-Gentile relations in Alexandria, Philo represents a narrow, elitist point of view. Philonic studies would thus do well to embrace social scientific approaches, which would provide a broader, more inclusive picture of all classes of society. (EB) 20071. J. F. M.

Philo (Virt. –), Josephus and the Mishnah treat this biblical law in ways similar to Paul, but, whereas their interpretation intends to enhance Jewish identity, Paul’s interpretation exhibits a definitely ecclesiological character and ultimately intends to enhance the identity of the church in Corinth as the exclusive community of the one Lord.

Philo’s historical and apologetic works depict the Hebrews and their Fathers as peaceful people, which does not exclude readiness for struggle, as the example of Phineas may illustrate. Finally, some hints as to the philosophical roots of Philo’s conception are given, notably the theme of the cosmopolitan state of the wise. (DZ) 20074. J. M.

A reading of Philo’s description of the community of the Therapeutae which focuses on the way he presents the women of the community. After some opening words in which she emphasizes that Philo’s depiction and the reality behind it will not be the same, the author first outlines the images of wom- anhood that Philo develops in his work, both in his allegories (in which it is often masculinized) and his description of social reality. When Philo includes women among the ‘disciples of Moses’ he does not domesticate them in the manner of female Pythagorean philosophers. Because he wants them to eclipse Greco-Roman models they seem ‘strangely beyond gender’ (p. ). Though described as ‘mothers’, in fact they move beyond womanliness to a state of spir- itually fruitful celibacy, which may be closer to a cultic and prophetic spir- ituality than to the philosophical life. Finally there is a discussion of how Philo presents a gendered space in their meeting house, in which it is possi- ble that female elders may have led the worship. In conclusion Taylor empha- sizes that in Philo’s description ‘the women of the community have not ‘become </page> <page sequence="131"> critical studies   men’ but retain the identification of women; . . . gender remains and has not been blurred by spiritual achievement’ (p. ). (DTR) 20077. C. Termini, Le potenze di Dio: studio su dynamis in Filone di Alessandria, Studia ephemeridis Augustinianum  (Rome ). The critical debate on the doctrine of the Powers in Philo concentrates on two problems, one genetic, the other functional (p. ). On the first problem it can be said that Philo inherits the concept of power from the Hellenistic-Jewish tradition which precedes him, which means that he inherits it in a theologi- cal, or rather a theophanic perspective, i.e. it is connected to the way that God reveals himself, either in revelation or in creation. At the same time Hellenis- tic Judaism, in developing the concept of divine dynamis, was influenced by the Hellenistic religious environment. The cultural polyvalence of the term finds its maximum extension in Philo. By speaking of powers in the plural (which rep- resents a break with the Alexandrian Jewish tradition) and emphasizing a uni- versalist and philosophical conception of God, Philo allows the transcendence of God to be preserved, though at the same time maintaining his direct concern with the world and the plurality of his manifestations in relation to humanity (pp. ff.). The resultant osmosis between Judaism and Hellenism allows the problem of anthropomorphic expressions in the biblical text to be resolved at least to a certain degree.These in fact can be taken to be nomore than symbols or descriptions of divine powerswhich allegory (esp. in the formof etymology or by means of division) succeeds in interpreting, in this way achieving a ‘conception of God purified of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic elements’ (pp. ff.). With regard to the functional aspect of dynamis, it needs to be understood that Philo is not completely clear on the relationship between essence and power in God: there appears at times to be a partial overlap of the two, which does find a precise articulation because the powers too are rooted in the depths of the divine mystery. From the allegorical point of view, against the background of divine transcendence, the powers are channelled into the twomajor figures of theos and kurios, into the symbolism of the two cherubim (in various hierarchical schemes which are fully analysed), and in the allegory of the creation of the human being. Here the powers have above all the role of acting as a ‘screen’ for God, guarantee- ing the extraneous nature of evil (cf. p. ). On this basis it can be affirmed that ‘in the creation of humanity no sin is introduced’ and that ‘evil depends wholly on the exercise of human freedom’.This means, according to the author, that the multiplicity of creators is only ‘virtual’ (p. ) and that, when allegorical neces- sity does not impose, God remains the sole protagonist in creation, and that δupsilonacuteναμις and πνεupsilontildeμα have for Philo above all an instrumental value. The divine power has in Philo a cosmological and an anthropological role, which confers on creation its stability and gives the powers the function of bond (δεσμ ς). At this point, according to Termini, the distance between Philo and both the Platonic doctrine of the World-soul and the Stoic concept of the pneuma-logos becomes apparent, because the notion of desmos in no way implies that God is (only) immanently present in the cosmos.

In Philo’s thought the connection between spirit and scripture operates at three levels.The first corresponds to the actual process of formulating the sacred text and is reserved forMoses.The second is linked to the translation of the Bible into the Greek language in the Septuagint. The third involves the allegorizing exegete, and thus Philo himself, in the task of uncovering the hidden and fundamental contents of revelation. The author, after presenting this analytical analysis of the three relations with reference to numerous texts, points out that they are based on a particular concept of revelation as a non-conclusive process, whichmoves from inspiration to translation and then to reflection. In actual fact both translation and commentary have the task of ‘unveiling the beauty of the Torah to the Greek-speaking world’ (p. ). (RR) 20079. T. H.

The author explores the question whether Philo wrote a treatise interpreting Gen :–: along the lines of Leg. and the allegory of the soul. He says there is enough evidence to suggest that Philo wrote such a treatise. The fact that two of the four treatises of Leg. have been lost makes it possible that a third treatise has been lost as well. The opening of Leg.  seems to refer to a previous interpretation of Gen  (Leg. .), one not found in Opif. Moreover Leg. ., – and Leg .– point retrospectively to an elaborate interpretation of Gen :– along the lines of the allegory of the soul. Tobin speculates that the treatise was intentionally suppressed by the Alexandrian Jewish community some time between Philo’s death and the Jewish revolt in Egypt in – c.e. (KAF) 20080. G.

Some works by Philo and Pseudo-Philo, which were translated into Arme- nian in about the th century, were actively commented on in twelfth–fourteenth centuries by Armenian ecclesiastical doctors (vardapets). While observing the hermeneutic ‘coat’ of the ‘Armenian Philo’, as well as the description of the ‘class- reading’ given in medieval Armenian manuscripts, it is possible to reconstruct the stages of preparing and digesting philosophical and theological texts which were included in the school curriculum. As such, the procedure did not differ from grammatical and rhetorical methods of analyzing, memorizing and para- phrasing texts, as they are described in Ars Grammatica by Dionysius Thrax and especially in the three chapters at the end ofProgymnasmata byTheonofAlexan- dria which were lost in Greek but are preserved in an ancient Armenian transla- tion. The correlation may be noted between these stages of commenting and the genres of commentaries: (a) the introductory lection about an author under the study (Gr. upsilonasperπ  εσις, Lat. causa, Arm. patcˇar ̇); (b) an exposition of the text(s), i.e. piece by piece paraphrase with sporadic explanations (the scholia in proper sense, Arm. lucmunk‘); (c) a concise rhetorical composition on the basis of the studied text, an epitome (arm. hawak‘umn).

This is the first part of a Habilitationsschrift (for the second volume on Philo and Josephus see below ) which against the backdrop of the ‘new perspective on Paul’ tries to differentiate the Jewish understanding of the Law from the rd century b.c.e. until the first half of the st century c.e. For this eleven Greek-speaking authors are selected, including Aristobulus, Ps.Aristeas and Wisdom. Diaspora Judaism, confronted with the rationalizing tendency of Hellenism, tried to maintain its identity by means of the Torah. Hellenistic culture is related to the Law of a single people, and at the same time this particular Law gets a universal meaning. This implies an ethical interpretation of the entire Torah which is founded in the nature of the cosmos created by God. The appendix treats  special questions, mainly of a philosophical kind (no.  on allegory) and mentions Philo on p. , p.  (the name(s) of God) and pp. – (Philo as founder of negative theology).

Through allegorical interpretation Philo can perceive the phenomena of the visible world as signs of an invisible One. In interpreting Abraham’s way as farewell to the universe of the senses (Abr. –), Philo at the same time justifies allegorical understanding as such. This shows the connection between cosmology, gnoseology and allegory. In the gnostic movement (e.g. the Naassenes Hippolytus, Ref. .ff.) allegorical interpretation serves the emancipation of the true Self. Here, the sensual world no longer bears the traces of God as it does in Philo. (DZ) 20084. J. Whitman, ‘Present Perspectives: Antiquity to the Late Mid- dle Ages,’ in J.

Philo, dis- cussed on pp. –, is said to have approached the spirit of Scripture through ‘continual engagement with the ‘letter’ of the law’—i.e., in both its narrative and legal portions. The second part of the essay addresses the extent to which allegorical interpretation might have ‘textures’ of its own. Here the literature reviewed pertains to philosophic modes in medieval Islam, Jewish approaches to philosophic allegory, Christian allegorization of ancient philosophic writing, and philosophic attitudes toward signification in Christian Scripture.

Rather than a philosophical dream (Engberg- Pedersen), the author concludes (p. ), the treatise is ‘a narrative of something real, a pedagogic and apologetic narrative, with formand content of an epideictic nature.’ Philo uses the techniques of rhetoric in order to offer a spirited defence of a philosophical way of life embodied by these ‘citizens of the heaven and the world’ (§).

The author argues against Engberg-Pedersen that Philo’s famous description of theTherapeutae is not a fiction or a thought experiment in narrative form. It is rather a consistent description in the form of an epideictic discourse, modelled as a narrative composition and integrating within it sequential articulations of narrative and chreia elaboration. Philo’s rhetorical techniques are illustrated by a structural analysis of the treatise, including detailed analyses of §§–  and §§–. The community consists of committed philosophers who apply themselves to learn with the all-wise Moses and reflect together on the actual truth, the meaning of which is hermeneutically disclosed and rhetorically mediated for instruction. The author suggests that the encomium of these philosophers may also have had a paraenetic function, i.e. Philo is encouraging his readers to pursue God’s friendship and true excellence of life.

The first focuses on the passages in which the Alexandrian con- demns the dance, whereas the second concentrates on the Philonic texts inwhich the dance is appreciated and celebrated. Prominent among these is Opif. (esp. §), which is connected with the Timaeus of Plato. Philo’s condemnation is reserved for a particular kind of dance—whether it is accompanied by the mime or is rather boisterous and masculine as mentioned in Agr. andMos. —which is tied to the senses, the passions and pure entertainment. This means that Philo does not condemn the dance as such. In fact, the dance that Philo particularly appreciates is the one of the virtuous person, who imitates the motions of the stars, not in a physical sense, but because it shares in harmony and measure, i.e. not so much a ‘danced’ dance, but rather a contemplated one. This not only prepares the soul for astronomy, but is also contemplation of the creation in all its beauty with a special involvement of the intellect (cf. Opif. –). But the dance can also be an expression of joy (Ebr.  f.), when the soul is full of grace or possessed by God (cf. Her.  f.). Finally there is a type of dance which is the perfect expression of piety (Contempl. ff.). In all these views, including the distinction between ‘lascivious’ and ‘virtuous’ dance Philo is indebted to Plato, except that in Plato the dancer is the virtuous person, who owes his virtue to himself, whereas in Philo the pious person is touched by God and swept along in a kind of ‘sober ecstasy’.

To determine how Philo saw the relationship between Greek culture and the opponents of the Jews in Alexandria, the author examines two commonplaces— first, that Philo was a great admirer of the Greeks and their culture and, second, that the opponents of the Jews in Alexandria were Greeks and Egyptians. Based on a study of vocabulary pertaining to ‘Greeks’ (LΕλληνες) and ‘Greece’ (MΕλλ ς), Birnbaum concludes that although Philo admired theGreeks and their culture, hewas also critical of them. At times he portrays the Jews as in someway better than Greeks and even as better than Greeks and barbarians combined. Philo never refers to the opponents of the Jews in Alexandria as Greeks and Egyptians. Instead he calls them Alexandrians and Egyptians, and he obscures distinctions between these two groups. Philo does not associate Alexandrian opponents of the Jews with Greek culture. Despite the universalizing aspects of his thought, he sometimes distinguishes sharply between Jews and non-Jews and sees Jews and their heritage as superior to all other peoples and cultures.

In this article the author argues that ‘Philo’s treatise called Legat. is to be ranked among Philo’s exegetical writings. In it Philo applies Scriptural principles to historical events in a way similar to that found in his expository writings, such as for example in Somn. .–.The conflict inAlexandria and Jerusalemwas a struggle for theway inwhich the Laws ofMoses and ancestral traditions should be interpreted and practised in society’ (). The laws are here thus interpreted relative to the practices in communal life and the critical events that took place. To demonstrate and substantiate this thesis, Borgen applies an interpretative model, formulated by B. Gerhardsson, that views the Jewish laws as woven into the very fabric of Jewish society and institutions. Borgen then investigates Legat. by focusing on the role of the Torah as inner tradition (the Torah-centric relation to the only god), verbal tradition (Torah as words), behavioural tradition (Torah as practised), institutional tradition (Torah as institution) andmaterial tradition (Torah as thing). In each section he starts with aspects from the Legat., and then relates these to comparable discussions in the expository writings, finding that the Embassy exemplifies how the Laws functioned in communal life on all these various levels.

Vetenskapssamhällets Uppsala Handlingar  (Uppsala ) –. The author here deals with Philo’s views on the relationships between Greek encyclical education, philosophy and the Jewish synagogues. In Philo, we find all the seven artes generales (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, music and astronomy) mentioned, though not all in one and the same work. Furthermore, as there were Greek debates on encyclia and philosophy, Philo’s writings also reflect these debates. Philo allows the encyclical education to be characterized as ‘virtue’, but as a kind of lower virtue than that of revealed wisdom. This distinction is interwoven in Philo’s writings. The encyclia is pri- marily a preparatory form of education. It should prepare for the true phi- losophy, which to Philo is the wisdom of Moses. According to Philo the Jew- ish synagogues are places of philosophy; they are schools of the sacred laws. Several aspects of Greek educational ideas are brought together in Philo’s dis- cussion of these issues. But a basic difference between these ‘two schools’ is that ‘the encyclia uses human teaching as its basis, whereas the philosophy of the Laws of Moses studied in the synagogues has its basis in self-taught wis- dom brought forth by nature itself ’ (p. ). The last part of this article deals with the dangers to be avoided. One is that the student should not become so charmed by the encyclia that he ignores philosophy, i.e. that he forgets to pro- ceed. Another danger is getting a false impression of God, still a third one is to misuse it for social and political offices of prestige. In this way Philo’s writ- ings demonstrate how central issues in his Greek educational environment also are mirrored in the Jewish fight for their identity in their Greco-Roman world. (TS) 20109. D.

This study concludes, on the basis of a comparative analysis of Philo’s Logos theology, theMemra of the Targum, and the Prologue of the Gospel of John, that the beginnings of Logos theology and trinitarian reflection are to be found, not in the mere idiosyncrasies of Philo but in the widespread religious imagination of st century Jews. In short, Logos theology as it comes to expression in Philo was an integral element of much Jewish and early Christian–Jewish theology. (KAF) 20110. G. R.

Although Philo says little about his exegetical method, it seems that he follows Stoic views in rationalizing his belief in Scripture. He has a deep interest in traditional Greekmythology, and—in contrast to Josephus—offers an allegorization of Greek myths. Philo considers the Jewish tradition as superior to the Greek tradition, which has deviated from the purest tradition of thought. Following Stoic views he sees the validity of a tradition in its antiquity. Because Scripture is older thanGreek philosophy it represents a superior theology. In this way he can justify his programme of allegorical exegesis. Reviews: J. M. Dillon, SPhA  () –. (ACG) 20111. R. Cacitti, ‘N* ε8ς :τι νupsilontildeν κα  ε8ς &gt;μOς κ ν νες.

An amply annotated study which explores how the Therapeutae as a move- ment in Judaism—when the latter was not yet separated fromnascent Christian- ity—came to be recognized, by a tradition of which Eusebius is witness, as the first Christians in Egypt. The author reviews the possible (and in his view prob- able) relationship between the Therapeutae and the Essenes, the historicity of Eusebius’ testimony and the characteristics of the Therapeutae’s monachism, ecstasis, and use of hymns. He concludes that early Alexandrian Christianity found enough reasons to consider the Therapeutic movement as being part of its own roots. (HMK) 20112. F. Calabi, ‘I sacrifici e la loro funzione conoscitiva in Filone di Alessandria,’ Annali di Storia dell’Esegesi  () –. The author analyses the double presentation of sacrifices in Philo, () in the literal sense, i.e. sacrifices as acts of worship rigorously following the norms of Leviticus, and () in the allegorical sense, i.e. sacrifices as signification, alluding to reality. The two conceptions are interrelated. It is emphasized that both cultic observance and the spiritual disposition of the sacrificer are of parallel importance.The attentiondirected at the status and the intention of the sacrificer are not in contrast with the value accorded to the purity of the body and the perfection of the offered victim, which means that the purity of the will of the sacrificer is also not set in opposition to the role of cultic norms centred on Jerusalem and the Temple. The article concentrates in particular on a special aspect of its theme: to what extent can sacrifices, as ‘signifiers’ of reality, be considered as a ‘language’, i.e. as formulations of truth expressed by means of cultic acts which refer back to the profound and real significance of the acts involved. Linked to this aspect is the pedagogic significance of the sacrifices which, far from serving God, are in fact useful for human beings. God has no need to receive what already belongs to him. The sacrifices are thus situated at two levels. In the first instance sacrifice is intended in the literal sense as cultic reality, but this does not detract from the sacrifice’s allegorical significance and </page> <page sequence="140">  part two symbolic value, which surpasses the simple offering ofmeat or plants. It becomes an evocation of themonad, of the cosmos, ofmoderation, of knowledge of divine grandeur, of the perfection of God’s works. Sacrifices, therefore, are indicators of messages, of linguistic elements which are situated in between reading of truth and instrument of knowledge. (RR) 20113. E.

Carter, ‘Adult Children and Elderly Parents: theWorlds of the New Testament,’ Journal of Religious Gerontology  () –. As background for understanding NT teaching about adult children and elderly parents, the author discusses Philo, Aristotle, and the nd century c.e. Stoic Hierocles. Philo speaks of honouring one’s parents in connection with the Fifth commandment. According to him parents have a God-like role, are supe- rior in virtue because they are older, and function as instructors and benefactors to their children. Philo does not acknowledge any change in the relationship between children and parents as children become adults. Based on Lev , Philo also mentions respect for the elderly, for whom parents are ‘prototypes’. Philo’s teachings are similar to other first-century discussions—which go back to as early as Aristotle—on household organization. Aristotle establishes a hierarchi- cal household structure in which themale is central—as husband, father, master, and wealth-earner. Children are indebted to parents for sustenance, upbringing, and education and remain obligated to parents throughout their lives. Hierocles also emphasizes a child’s ‘never-ending obligation’ to care for parents (p. ) and elaborates on this obligation in several ways. The NT does not speak with one voice on this issue. Some writings uphold Aristotelian tradition, but Matthew calls for a new kind of community of disciples that is egalitarian and inclusive. This diversity in NT positions opens the way for different Christian responses regarding obligations of adults to their parents. (EB) 20115. A.

Contrary to Sanders, Das argues that certain Jewish writers, including Philo, maintained that Jews were expected to obey the Mosaic law perfectly and in its entirety (Spec. .–). Although complete obedience to the Law is impossible, it must be pursued. A merciful God graciously bestows for- giveness on the person who repents and participates in the sacrificial system.

The article examines the extra-biblical Jewish traditions on the creation of man, especially in the Apocryphal books and early rabbinical literature. Although it does not concentrate on Hellenistic Jewish authors, it does mention Philo several times to document the antiquity of various traditions on Adam’s creation: the Creator’s dialogue with the angels or with their powers, Adam’s relationship with the four elements, the narrow correlation between Adam, Logos and the cosmos, the double creation of man and his intermediate nature as a creature with free will.

For Philo the virtue of hospitality was particularly important in view of the charge made to the Jews of their being misanthropic and hateful toward strangers. He emphasizes the inhospitality of the people of Sodom in contrast with the hospitality of Abraham and Lot. The Sodomites’ second vice was their extreme licenctiousness. In Philo’s account of Gen – (in various treatises), Abraham does not dispute or bargain with God, but rather pleads with Him. For Philo there is no problem of theodicy: he justifies the destruction of Sodom by noting that all inhabitants were involved in unholy acts. Philo stresses that it is not God who is the cause of evil, but his subordinates who do the work of punishing sinners. Philo couples the Flood (destruction by water) </page> <page sequence="142">  part two and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (by fire). In addition to his literal explanation, Philo also, in his usual fashion, explains the episode allegorically. (HMK) 20120. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo’s Interpretation of Joshua,’ Journal for the Study of Pseudepigrapha  () –. As its title indicates, this article investigates how Philo portrays Joshua. Generally, he tends to downgrade Joshua in order to stress Moses’ role. Retelling the war with Amalek (Mos. .), he presents Moses as mustering the men and taking the lead, whereas in the biblical account it is Joshua who leads the battle (Exod :–). In the episode with the golden calf, when the people cry (Exod :), Joshua represents one’s subjective feeling toward the tumult, but Moses knows the true cause (Ebr. ). In his account of the mission of the spies to the promised country, Philo does notmentionCaleb and Joshua by name,when they report a deviating point of view (Mos. .–). Philo does, however, discuss at some length the fact that, when Moses chooses a successor, he does not select one of his sons, but appoints Joshua. (ACG) 20121. K. A. Fox, Paul’s Attitude toward the Body in Romans –: Compared with Philo of Alexandria (diss. St. Michael’s College, Toronto ). The inceptive stimulus for this examination of the body was the question whether Paul held a disparaging view of the body. This investigation concludes that he did deprecate the body. For the unbaptized, this attitude came to expres- sion in his assertion that, even though the cosmic power of sin acts upon the entire person, yet there is a peculiar relationship between that power and the body, whereby sin seizes the body, and then from its seat in the body wages war against the mind and its desire to do good. The result of this is the captivity and enslavement of the mind in the body under the power of sin. Further devalua- tion of the body came into view with respect to Paul’s attitude toward the body of the baptized. For while the mind of the baptized experiences life, the body does not. Presently, the body of the believer is mortal and corrupt—like Philo, Paul devalues the body because it is mortal—, and as such it is the dwelling place of sinful passions. To the extent that Paul devalued the body in ways that he did not devalue the mind, it can be said he shared with the dominant Greek culture a deprecating view of the body. Yet when his attitude is brought into relation with Philo’s, the author is led to conclude that Paul’s devaluation of the body was much less extreme than Philo’s. For contrary to Philo, Paul identified with the biblical notion that the body is a territory for purity and dedication to God, and held out a future for the resurrection of the body. (KAF) 20122. L.

Even though one finds a fairly critical view of Jacob in the prophetic context, the Jewish authors of the Hellenistic-Roman epoch testify to his idealization. This applies particularly to themost importantwitness, Philo of Alexandria, who sees in the patriarch the model of progression by πρO ις and )σκησις, i.e. the ascetic par excellence. It is his practical engagement in life that makes him show progress. His reward is expressed symbolically by the change of name which the athlete Jacob receives: Israel, which for Philo means ‘he who sees God’, whereas Jacob is the name for study and progress. Beside this reward, Philo also cites an additional prize, ‘numbing of the hip’, which symbolizes the paralysis of the impetuosity of the passions. (JR) 20124. D.

The author claims that the commonly perceived opposition in Judaism of the Second Temple period to the union of the offices of priesthood and king- ship deserves careful reexamination. In response to a scholarly consensus that interprets widespread enmity to the Hasmonean dynasty as a result of princi- pled opposition to the possibility of the linking of the roles of king and priest, Goodblatt argues that such expressions are consistently ad hominem and should not be treated as an expression of ideological incompatibility. In the course of the argument, Philo’s standpoint is reviewed (pp. –): the brief examination of five key passages leads the author to the conclusion that Philo is positively inclined in principle to the possibility of the union of kingship and priesthood, while his reservations are always on the level of either practical difficulty or his- torical circumstance.

Philo justifies the Jubilee year from an ethical point of view, but also emphasizes the connections which he sees between the Jubilee year and the contemplation of the universe.

The article discusses three forms of Jewish community life: the Essenes, the Qumran community, and the Therapeutae. The article begins by looking briefly at the identity and organizational structure of the first two groups and then examines the Therapeutae in greater detail. Described by Philo in his Contempl., the group’s characteristic features include the presence of women, celibacy practiced by all members, and total dedication to contemplative life. The discussion focuses on the Therapeutae’s social-cultural extraction, their daily contemplative life, the Scriptures and other books they used, the question whether they performed manual labour, their celebration of the Sabbath, their festival of the fiftieth or forty-ninth day (with Nikiprowetzky’s reconstruction), their celibacy, theTherapeutrides and themeaning of ‘elderly virgins’ (Contempl.  and Cher. ). The article concludes with a discussion whether the three groups were autonomous or related to one another. It is argued that the Essenes and the Qumran community were closely related; the community experience of theTherapeutae, on the other hand, was independent and unique.

Hellenistic Jewish thought, with a special focus on Philo, is one of the four periods dealt with in this dissertation, which investigates the interpretation of the phrase tohu va-vohu up to and including the Middle Ages. Two basic approaches are followed.The first is philological, the second utilizes philosophi- cal exegesis and inter-textual analysis. It is speculated that there might have been a kind of ‘Jewishmatter’, in which everything is mixed up as mish-mash, in con- trast to the Greek idea of four elements. The ethical connotations of the concept are also pursued throughout the entire period covered by the study. It might seem that matter has a kind of eternity and so can be regarded as somewhat like God. Many authors warn against such a misapprehension. (DTR; based on DAI-A /, p. ) 20128. D. M.

He used both literal and allegorical exegesis of the Bible and believed that the deepest understanding of the laws comes from allegorical interpretation. The spiritual journey of the individual is at the core of Philo’s religious philosophy, but he was a leader in the Alexandrian Jewish community and he evinces solidarity with the entire Jewish nation. ‘Covenantal nomism’ is not a useful description for Philo’s deeply individualistic religious pattern. He rarely mentions the divine covenant with Israel and his frame of thought is not soteriological. Taking for granted the requirement of obedience to Mosaic laws, Philo equates these laws with the law of nature. He believes in divine grace but also affirms rewards for the good and punishments for the wicked. While Philo does not argue directly that Judaism is the ultimate truth, onemay conclude this fromhisworks. (EB) 20129. E. Hilgert, ‘The Philo Institute, Studia Philonica and their Diadochoi,’ in D.

Interesting observations on Wolfson’s theory on the beginnings of Western religious philosophy in which Philo played a central role. Since the American scholar regarded the biblical elements as dominant and the role of Greek phi- losophy as subordinate, it should be seen as a non-symmetric binary synthesis. Comparisons are also made with Scholem’s theory, which attributed a dominant role to Jewish gnosticism. In both cases biographical factors may explain why they sought for beginnings.

Although there are many decidedly Stoic terms and concepts in Philo’s treatment of natural law, his presentation of such ideas is scarcely typ- ical of the Stoics in every respect, because it is also informed by his dependence on other traditions of discourse, whether Middle Platonic, Neo-Pythagorean or Jewish. The result is a quite distinctive presentation of the Stoic correlation of λ γ ς and law. (DTR) 20132. D. R.

In  c.e. the emperor Gaius (Caligula) ordered his statue to be placed inside the Jewish Temple at Jerusalem. Herod Agrippa I, the King of Judaea and a good friend of the emperor, wrote a letter to Gaius attempting to convince him to cancel the decree. According to the Jewish writer Philo of Alexandria, who preserved Agrippa’s letter in his writings, the letter convinced Gaius to cancel the decree. Three months later, Gaius was assassinated, ending the threat to the Temple and the expected violent Jewish resistance. While many historians are convinced that Philo wrote the letter, this study shows that the evidence points toward Herod Agrippa as its author. The letter not only revealed Agrippa’s views towards the Jewish God, Yahweh, but it was also an effective manifesto for peace between the Jews and the Romans who ruled over them.

Kamesar, ‘Ambrose, Philo, and the Presence of Art in the Bible,’ Journal of Early Christian Studies  () –. </page> <page sequence="147"> critical studies   The article is a treatment of Ambrose, Ep. , inwhich he addresses a problem that had long troubled educated readers of the Greek and Latin Bible, but came especially to the fore during the pagan-Christian cultural rivalries of the fourth century.The problemwas that the biblical authors did not appear to have written their works according to principles of literary art involving rules of composition and style. In defence Ambrose puts forward the assertion that the requisites of art are in fact indicated in the biblical text. In formulating this claim he relies heavily on a section of Philo’s treatise Fug. –. However, in this passage Philo is not concerned with the issue of art in the Bible. Nevertheless, although Ambrose does remove the Philonic passage from its original context, in his own way he does return to that context. Suggestions are made as to why Ambrose took the passage in the direction that he does. These reasons have as much to do with changes in the general philosophical and religious environment in the period between the two authors as they do with specifically Christian as opposed to Jewish approaches to the divine text. () The tendency to concretize the abstract divine word as the written text of Scripture is a general post-Philonic development in both Judaism and Christianity. () The manner in which Ambrose interprets the three-fold scheme of Fug.  is probably due to a late Platonic (rather than Stoic) orientation towards the concepts involved. On the other hand () the assumption that the ram of Gen  typifies the Christ/Logos is based on a Christian reading of the text, and () the identification of the Christ/Logos with the ‘inscripted’ logos is derived from Alexandrian Christian theology. However, the identification of the λ γ ς with the  π τ λεσμα of the text is based on a tighter application of Philo’s allegorization to the actual wording of the text. The implications of this identification as refined by Ambrose, although seemingly alien to the apparent context at the beginning of the letter, move in a thoroughly Philonic direction.

The author gives an overall view of the history of reception (Wirkungs- geschichte) of the Decalogue in Early Judaism. Among other Jewish Greek Literature—Septuagint, Letter of Aristeas, Wisdom of Solomon and the Greek Jewish Tradition around Alexandria—it is especially Philo who underlines the centrality of the Decalogue. In the end of the treatise Decal. – he summa- rizes his understanding: the Decalogue is an abbreviation of the whole Torah. The Decalogue is related to all people, not restricted exclusively to Israel. This text (and the parallel inHer. –) is discussed and its importance for Philo underlined. According to Philo the Decalogue seems to be an universal call of Jewish law: law for the whole world (cf. in the same collection D. Sänger, ‘Tora für die Völker—Weisungen der Liebe: Zur Rezeption des Dekalogs im frühen Judentum und Neuen Testament’ –, esp. –).

Abraham’s leaving his father’s house in response to God’s command in Gen : raises for several interpreters the question of whether he ignored his filial responsibility to stay with his father, Terah, and bury him at his death. Philo (Migr. ) and Stephen (Acts :) maintain that Abraham left Haran after his father died, a claim with no basis in the LXX.The solution of R. Isaac in Genesis Rabbah that Terah was spiritually dead may indicate a Jewish background to Jesus’ saying in Matt. :– (Luke :–): ‘Leave the dead to bury their own dead.’ Figurative understandings of ‘dead’ as spiritually dead can be found in Philo and rabbinic sources, which have in common some prooftexts and exegetical methods. A related notion is that ‘the righteous dead are really alive.’ In rabbinic and Hellenistic writers, including Philo, death might refer to wickedness generally, to participation in worldly life, or to life as a pagan. </page> <page sequence="149"> critical studies   Conversion is often seen as a new birth, separating proselytes from their families of origin.

Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (Oxford ), esp. –. This monograph contains a brief discussion on impurity and sin in Philo’s thought. For Philo there is clearly a relationship between ritual and moral impu- rity. Ritual impurity, affecting our bodies, is resolved by ritual purification, and the defilement of the soul, caused by various kinds of sins, is resolved by sacri- ficies. Because the soul is superior to the body, moral purity is more important than ritual purity, Philo does not consider ritual impurity as a punishment for sin: it is natural and often unavoidable.

Within the culture and religiosity of Israel there is the significant problem of the relationship between the proclaimed transcendence of God (from which derives his substantial unknowability and ineffability) and his constant presence in theworld and in the history of Israel. For this reason it has proved necessary to single out mediating figures, among which the Logos of Philo stands out. In the few pages that Kraus Reggiani devotes to this argument, she succeeds in giving a complete outline of the significance of the Logos in Philo by means of citations and comments on the chief Philonic texts on this subject. The author warns, however, that ‘logos’ is an ambiguous term with a diversity of meaning that can be quite disconcerting. She adds that its significance sometimes is confused or identified with the biblical Wisdom. Thus if the Logos is the principle ( ρ1 ) in philosophical contexts, Wisdom is the basic principle in the biblical context. (RR) 20141. J. Leonhardt, JewishWorship in Philo of Alexandria, Texts and Studies in Ancient Judiasm  (Tübingen ). The monograph offers a detailed description and analysis of Philo’s views on worship. It is argued that it is problematic to use a definition of the modern term ‘worship’ as the starting point of the research. Instead Philo’s own terminology should be used.The study analyses the terrain covered by the term λ τρεια (even though it is not very common in Philo) rather than  εραπε α (which is too broad). It consists of three main chapters.The first discusses the Jewish festivals, with a special emphasis on the Sabbath and Sabbath assemblies. Leonhardt strongly rejects any notion of distinguishing between Sabbath observance and Sabbath worship. For Philo the very purpose of the Sabbath is to rest from one’s labours so that one can study the holy books and so approach God. The second </page> <page sequence="150">  part two main chapter treats prayer (including vows) and praise, with a long section on Philo’s use of the Psalms and on his references to psalm and hymn singing. Prayers, vows and hymns are all associated with thanksgiving to God. But for Philo εupsilonlenis1αριστ α (a largely non-Septuagintal term) is the fundamental attitude behind all religious acts and must pervade every aspect of worship. The third chapter focuses on the Temple in Jerusalem, including issues of tax, offerings, sacrifice and purification. Leonhardt strongly emphasizes Philo’s loyalty to the Temple.This devotion allows him to present Judaism as the ultimate cult for the entire world, not an ideal as in Plato, but actually realized in practice through its worship of the one God and creator. The study concludes with a chapter summarizing its results. It emerges that Philo’s knowledge of Jewish tradition appears to be broader than is sometimes assumed. Material aspects of religious ritual remain important for the social and corporeal aspects of life.The symbolic meaning of religious acts leads the worshipper to a life in direct relation to God the creator. This means that for Philo Jewish worship offers what no other Hellenistic cult could, a set of rites that do justice to the social needs of humanity but also offer a philosophical system that satisfies the needs of the intellect. For Philo, therefore, Judaism is the ultimate Hellenistic cult (cf. p. ). Reviews: C. Grappe, RHPhR  () –; A. M.Mazzanti, Adamant  () – ; D. M.

(JPM) 20143. Y. D. Matusova, ‘Philo of Alexandria and Greek Doxography’ [Russian], Vestnik Drevnej Istorii  () –. The article was written partly in response to D. T. Runia’s note on ‘Why does Clement of Alexandria call Philo the Pythagorean?’ in VChr  () – (= RRS ). While commenting on Clement of Alexandria, Strom. ..–, the author suggests that the somewhat strange philosophical school attribution of Aristobulus and Philo means simply that Clement puts these persons in the general perspective of Greek philosophy. Matusova notes that both authors believe that the teaching of Moses was accepted by Pythagoras followed by Plato and Aristotle. As Matusova writes, ‘it was not unusual for the first generation of Aristotle’s disciples to connect the Pythagorean doctrine </page> <page sequence="151"> critical studies   of which they produced the first systematic descriptions, with the Orient in general and with Judaea in particular. Later these ideas became very popular with the Neopythagoreans whose literary and philosophical activity was closely connected with the heritage of the Peripatos’. While Aristoxenus (at Hippolytus Haer. .., , Eusebius PE ..) for the first time connects the person of Pythagoras with the Chaldeans, Theophrastus (De pietate, at Porphyry De Abst. .) and Clearchos (De Educatione, at D.L. ., cf. De somno, at Jos. Ap. .) develop the idea of borrowing from the Eastern wisdom. Sotion of Alexandria (rd century b.c.e.) (cf. Diels Dox. Gr. ) and Heraclides Lembos (ibid. – ) are doxographers who testify to the fact that Pythagoras has borrowed some of his ideas from the wisdom of the East. Hermippus was the first known author to witness to Pythagoras’ connection with Judeans (at Jos. Ap. .– ; Origen, Cels. .). Aristobulus says that Pythagoras draws heavily on the teaching of Moses and so does Philo when he connects Plato’s philosophy with Mosaic teaching. The author concludes that the epithets of ‘Peripatetic’ and ‘Pythagorean’ given by Clement to Aristobulus and Philo in connection with the history of philosophy illustrate the two periods (Post-Aristotelian and Neo- Pythagorean) of this doxographic tradition.

Philo of Alexandria has been characterized by scholars of the twentieth century as a great philosopher (Harry A. Wolfson), a Hellenized mystic (Erwin R. Goodenough, David Winston), and recently as an allegorizing exegete of the Hebrew scriptures (Valentin Nikiprowetzky and Peder Borgen). Nikiprowetzky and Borgen viewed Philo as an exegete, whose commentaries are designed to explain the Pentateuch to a thoroughly Hellenized religious community. While this debate continues among Philonic scholars, contemporary New Testament studies have downplayed at best, and ignored at worst, Philo’s contribution to the understanding of the Christian scriptures. By comparing Philo’s writings with Paul’s Letter to the Galatians, this dissertation attempts to advance the perspective that Philo was an exegete and that his writings are useful to New Testament scholarship. After a brief biographical introduction to the lives of Philo and Paul in ch. , the dissertation surveys the survival of Philo’s writings and outlines Philonic scholarship of the twentieth century in ch. . Ch.  provides a historical backdrop by surveying the history of interpretation of the Jews during the Second Temple period and the Christians in the early first century. Following the survey, this chapter focuses on three key features of Philo’s andPaul’s interpretativemethodology: the socio-historical contexts of their first- century readers, their use of the literal and allegorical methods of interpretation, and their apologetic motives. Ch.  compares Philo’s and Paul’s interpretations of the narrative of Abraham, Sarah andHagar found inGen–.Using the socio- historical discussion of ch.  as a point of departure, this chapter juxtaposes the author’s interpretative rationale and structure in order to discover common exegetical elements.

Ch.  highlights the contributions of each chapter and posits areas for further study. While no single factor may be sufficient to support the entire thesis, the cumulative effect of the biographical, motivational, and exegetical similarities uncovered in this dissertation offer valid evidence for the comparative approach to understanding Philo of Alexandria.

Philo’s cosmogonical theory is systematically explained in hisworkOpif., con- sidered as an allegorical interpretation of the book of Genesis. This interpreta- tion, however, in some crucial points shows remarkable parallels, formal as well as essential ones, to Plato’s Timaeus. The paper examines the possible influences, affinities and differences between the two texts. It concentrates, through a com- parative study, on the examination of the structural points of the two theories on the creation of the world, namely (i) the relationship between model and image both at the ontological and the epistemological level, (ii) the reasons of a theory of double creation in Philo, (iii) the types of causes introduced for the explanation of cosmogonical processes, and (iv) the roles and characteristics of the precosmic stage, time and intermediate creatures. Finally the author sug- gests that Philo’s work should be regarded as a fine example of the way in which the philosophical exegesis introduces a necessary alteration of the interpreter’s disposition and point of view in relation to the text she has to explain. Philo, in fact, passes the bounds set by religion not only by making use of a terminol- ogy which is completely different from the religious one. His allegorical inter- pretation gives a new perspective to universal questions rendering them more existential and more immediately relevant for the individual.

The author studies Philo’s ideas by drawing upon the theories of F. Barth and C. Geertz. Emphasizing subjective rather than objective standards, these thinkers see the key to understanding ethnic identity and culture in how groups perceive themselves in relation to others and how groups select features of their environment as self-defining. Following the Introduction, Part One on Jewish identity covers how Philo perceived Jews in relation to Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks. Two other chapters are devoted to ‘Jewish Descent: Mothers and Moth- ercities’ and ‘Jewish Values: Religion and Self-Restraint.’ An overriding theme in Part One is that Philo’s views on all these topics were strongly influenced by ‘the contemporary Roman discourse.’ Philo wrote for his elite Jewish associates, whose opinions he wished to bring into accord with this discourse of the ruling </page> <page sequence="153"> critical studies   class.

Taking his point of departure in Gaius Caligula’s decision to have a statue of himself installed in the Jewish Temple at Jerusalem, the author discusses this and other episodes in order to reach a conclusion on the general Jewish reactions to the imperial cult. Using the works of Philo, Josephus, the Rabbis and some papyri and inscriptions, the author’s main thesis is that the case of Caligula was exceptional, and that usually there was no pressure from central authorities for Jews to compromise with the cult, although the issue may have been less clear- cut at a local level. In general, the Jews seem to have been content to ignore the imperial cult, and the proponents of the cult were content to ignore the Jews. (TS) 20148. M. Osmans ́ki, Logos i stworzenie. Filozoficzna interpretacja traktauDe opificiomundi Filona zAleksandrii [Polish:Logos and creation. Philosophical Interpretation of the treatise De opificio mundi of Philo of Alexandria] (Lublin ). In this book the author focuses on the problem of Logos in Opif. and its place within Philo’s conception of creation. The main analysis is preceded by a brief exposition of Philo’s life, his philosophical background, the structure and place of the treatise in the Philonic corpus and the sources of his conception of the Logos. In the first chapter two main questions are raised: () Is the Logos to be identified with or distinguished from God? () Is the Logos created or not created? In the next chapter questions concerning the immanent Logos are raised: () Is it material or immaterial? () How can its relation to nature or the law of nature be described? In the final chapter the Logos’ relation to human beings is analysed. Each of these questions is preceded by a review of scholarly positions on the subject. Although the author refrains from giving definitive answers to these problems, he argues for an interpretation of the Logos in Philo as ‘God’s mind turned towards creation’. Within the Logos thus conceived he distinguishes four aspects: () formal, i.e. thinking itself; () material, i.e. the ideas conceived; () unifying or arranging, i.e. the unity of all the ideas forming one archetype; () creative, i.e. creating the sensible world according to the archetype. In a formal sense the Logos is the principle of the unity of these four aspects in the act of creation. It seems that the manifestation of these four </page> <page sequence="154">  part two elements are identifiable in the material world (though under different names), which means that the basic unity of the transcendent and immanent aspects of the Logos can be maintained: God’s mind, which serves as an ‘instrument’ during creation, is ‘then’ introduced into the world and serves as nature (or immanent Logos) in maintaining its existence and governing its course. The Logos’ relation to humankind is twofold: anthropological, which consists in likeness (or kinship) between God and the human mind, and ethical, which arises from that likeness and consists either in direct illumination of the human mind by the Logos, or in an indirect influence through the mediation of the Mosaic Law. In the view of the author Philo’s conception of the Logos may be regarded as his answer to the difficulties contained in the biblical account of creation, namely the creation of the sensible world by the transcendent God, God’s presence in this world ‘after’ creation, the resemblance of human beings to God, and the story of creation in six days. Thus the conception of the Logos makes it possible for Philo () to include earlier notions of creation such as forming or ordering (Plato) and thinking (Aristotle), () to emphasize the absolute transcendence of God who ‘limits’ his gifts in the Logos, () to bring together God (the Logos as God’s nous) and the creation (the Logos as its model), () to explain God’s activity as creatio continua, and () to show that God’s creative activity is proportional to its subject (the Logos as the model and guide for the world and human beings).

There are three witnesses to the Jewish scriptures at the time of Jesus: the Dead Sea scrolls, the works of Philo of Alexandria and the writings of the New Testament.Thanks to the texts ofQumranwe understand better the pre-eminent role of the Torah and its cult, a cult which is also attested by Philo. He comments on the Torah and is also the first extant witness to its composition in five books.

By the time of Philo it had become established practice in the ancient world for writers to divide longer works into books, which generally coincided with the length of writing that could be placed on a papyrus scroll. This was not only a practical feature, but was also used for literary purposes and so had an effect on how works were planned and written. In this article Royse presents a comprehensive and detailed treatment of all the information we can find in Philo about how he consciously divided up his treatises. After discussing the ancient context, he first examines how Philo refers to his own works. This often occurs at the beginning of treatises. Philo is generally rather inexact about the number of books in a particular work or series, which is in marked contrast to Josephus’ practice. Next the terminology that Philo uses for his books is analysed. The relevant terms are:  ι λ  ν/   λ ς, γρα  , λ γ ς, πραγματε α and σupsilonacuteντα ις. Further evidence on Philo’s practice is supplied by divisions in manuscripts of his writings, which often appear to reflect his original divisions, and also by the way he refers to the writings of others. In the final part of the article Royse returns to the difficult question of the original division into books of the Quaestiones (cf. R-R ). It is conceded that the evidence is fragmentary and sometimes contradictory. Nevertheless, Royse argues, it is possible to reconstruct the original structure so that justice is done to most of the evidence. Philo appears to take the physical constraints of books in his time into account, but also wishes to follow the divisions of the biblical text as used in Synagogue readings of his time. (DTR) 20157.

This fine study, a dissertation written at the University of Lund, Sweden, and supervised by Prof. Birger Olsson, is part of a large-scale project directed by him onTheAncient Synagogue: Birthplace of TwoWorld Religions.The author’s ambi- tion is to present a socio-historical investigation of the origins of the ancient syn- agogue. After an introduction (pp. –), he deals with Important Views and Theories over  Years (pp. –), The First Century Synagogue (pp. – ), The Origins of the Synagogue in the Land of Israel (pp. –), The </page> <page sequence="157"> critical studies   Origins of the Synagogue in the Diaspora (pp. –), and a summary chapter on Some Decisive Stages in the Development of the Early Synagogue (pp. – ). He further presents his aim as to ‘define what is meant by ‘synagogue’ and trace its origins in the Land of Israel as well as in the Diaspora.’ In doing this, he focuses especially on issues such as institutional, liturgical, non-liturgical and spatial aspects of his subject, but the aspect functioning as a sine qua non for the identification of a ‘synagogue’ is the public reading and teaching of the Torah. His main and partly innovative conclusions are that the origin of the ‘synagogue’ as a public assembly including Torah-reading rituals is bound to the administrative structure of the land of Israel and goes back to the Persian period, more specifically to the reign of Artaxerxes (p. ). The first signs of non-official institutions dedicated to communal reading and study of Torah appeared somewhere in the final phase of the Early Hellenistic and the begin- ning of the late Hellenistic period. These voluntary associations were proba- bly influenced by the general pattern of the Graeco-Roman thiasoi or collegia. The developments of the ‘synagogue’ in the Diaspora were, however, quite dif- ferent from those in the land of Israel. In Diaspora countries with an ancient Jewish presence, the ‘synagogue’ grew from Jewish temples (p. ). The author deals with the works of Philo in several of his sections, not least in Chapter Five on the origins of the Diaspora synagogue. Concerning Egypt, he argues that the ‘synagogues’ of the first century c.e. were, spatially, temples into which ‘synagogue’ rituals had been incorporated. This he also finds confirmed by the use of the term πρ σευ1  in several texts, Philo’s works included. Further- more, he reads Philo, Spec. . as addressed to Jews, and its reference to a Jewish Temple. The same basic interpretation he finds valid for Deus  and Flacc. –. Hence, the πρ σευ1 -synagogue of Philo’s time grew from a tem- ple institution, and in fact, was still a temple in its nature and architecture. (TS) 20158. D. T. Runia, ‘Philo’s Reading of the Psalms,’ in D. T. Runia and G. E.

The book of the Psalms has played amajor role in expressing both Jewish and Christian spirituality. Philo refers to the Psalms about forty times, which ismuch less than his references to the Pentateuch. Nevertheless it seems worthwhile to look at his use and reading of the book in closer detail. The article first presents the evidence. Twenty quotations or paraphrases and ten allusions to Psalm texts are presented, divided into Philo’s three major biblical commentaries. In each case location, context, method of introduction, text, method of citation and pretext for citation are outlined.The evidence fully justifies the division into two distinct groups. For example, most allusions are found in the Exposition of the Law, which contains no cited texts at all. On the other hand, all quotations or paraphrases are introduced by an explicit introductory formula preceding the text itself. In all cases the text cited is very short. In only one case does it exceed </page> <page sequence="158">  part two ten words (Gig. ). All the passages discussed occur in allegorical contexts. Why does Philo quote them, even though they are not part of the Pentateuch? The author suggests three reasons: () evidence or proof of a daring exegesis; () illustration of an exegetical point being made; () offering fresh material which allows the exegesis to be substantiated and advanced.Abrief section of the article also discusses other references to hymns and songs, e.g. in the accounts of the Therapeutae and of the events in Alexandria involving the Prefect Flaccus. The article ends with a discussion of Philo and the spirituality of the Psalms. The full potential of that spirituality is certainly not exploited. On occasion it is even toned down. Philo does not feel a need to exploit it because through his use of the allegorical method he is already spiritualizing the Pentateuch. (DTR) 20159. D. T.

Brief account of Philo’s distinctive interpretation of the books ofMoses as part of the Introduction to the publication of the translations of the entire Pentateuch prepared by the project ‘La Bible d’Alexandrie’. Philo’s three commentaries are discussed and attention is drawn to the diversity of interpretations which they contain, which is at least partly explained by his debts to Alexandrian predeces- sors. The survival of Philo’s works is a great stroke of luck, because they yield insight into a very different kind of Judaism than is found in the Rabbinic tra- dition, a form of Judaism which was later to exert considerable influence on the Fathers of the Church.

In his ways of handling statues, either as concrete phenomena or as elements in figurative speculation, Philo demonstrates the difficulty he had in balancing between the commitment to his Jewish religious heritage and his fondness for the culture of the Greco-Roman world. He fights for monotheism and aniconic religion against polytheism and worship of images. For his basic Jewish attitude he every now and then finds support in ideas of a Platonic kind (e.g. Decal. – ; Spec. .–; Gig. ). Nevertheless, Sandelin argues, Philo cannot always resist the fascination that statues of the gods exert on his mind. When in a non- Jewish manner he evaluates them in positive terms, he reveals his indebtedness to Platonism (cf. Opif. ; Ebr. ff.). There exists at this point in his thought a conflict between the Jewish and the Greek ideas that cannot be reconciled.

Philo’s exegesis of the Decalogue emphasizes two aspects: first its importance in relation to the other legal regulations; second its role as an abbreviation of the whole Torah, since the other legal injunctions are linked to it (see also the article of U. Kellermann in this same collection, summarized above ). The second—ethical—tablet seems to be more important for him than the first. Nevertheless these systematics donot diminish theDecalogue’s authority. Sänger emphasizes this Jewish background also in the New Testament understanding of the Decalogue. Even if the Decalogue itself is not cited often, it remains the fundamental orientation for ethics. In particular the second tablet was the basis for the dialogue with non-Jews, as is shown by the majority of New Testament texts in which the Decalogue is cited. (GS) 20162. U. Schnelle, M.

In some Jewish diaspora works, the terms π ρ ικ ς κα  παρεπ δημ ς belong to the semantic fields of ‘proselyte/proselytism’. In Peter, however, they do not indicate that the recipients of the letter are considered former proselytes. Drawing on the view ofG. Lakoff andM. Johnson,Metaphorswe live by (Chicago ), the author argues that the terms function rather as metaphors drawn from the social world of proselytes (source domain), which characterize the social situation of the Petrine Christians (target domain), and especially throw light on the social estrangement of the Christian converts in the Greco-Roman </page> <page sequence="160">  part two societies of Asia Minor as understood by the author. Several aspects from the works of Philo are used to demonstrate how the social conditions of proselytes may illuminate issues in Peter. (TS) 20164. A. M.

In interpreting the symbol of the sword representing the word of God, the author also deals with the contribution of Philo. This occurs in section II devoted to ancient Jewish literature. The biblical passages which he focuses on are Gen :, :, Exod : and Num :, where Philo takes the sword as symbolizing the word of God. The major part of the discussion, however, concentrates on an analysis of the doctrine of the Logos cutter in Her. Here the double role, i.e. both cosmological and soteriological, of the Logos comes clearly to the fore. (RR) 20165. R.

The author analyses a few words from the first book of Spec. and the way that they are rendered in the Armenian translation. For example the translation of  μ upsilonacuteσων in Spec. . corresponds to a lexical calque with the Armenian term anerazˇisˇt (non-musical), which introduces the significance of ‘uneducated and boorish’ in a form that hitherto did not exist and so is only comprehensible with reference to the Greek. In another case, Spec. ., the Armenian translation allows us to reconstruct the exact form of the Greek text. Other cases in turn demonstrate inaccuracies and errors of comprehension on the part of the trans- lator (e.g. in Spec. .). (RR) 20166. Y. Shibata, ‘On the Ineffable.

The main emphasis of the article is on Justin, but Philo is brought in mainly at the beginning for purposes of comparison and contrast. In the view of the author Philo places more emphasis on the limitations of the human cognitive faculty. Justin’s main emphasis is different. The ineffable maintains a certain contact with human language through the evolution of the Logos in his incarnate role. (DTR) </page> <page sequence="161"> critical studies   20167. F.

In this work Newton searches for an explanation of bodily motion, and he employs the Stoic notion of divine pneuma as a cause of the motion of bodies. Interpreting the working of God in nature, Newton makes use of Philo, who immaterializes the materialistic pneuma of the Stoics. For Newton, as for Philo, God is both immanent and transcendent at the same time. Newton also profits from the works of the Neo-Stoic Justus Lipsius (–), who is acquainted with Philo’s works and uses him to reconcile Stoicism with Christianity.

The second part of the chapter deals with the Philo- nian theology (method of the interpretation of the Scripture, theGod, the Logos, –). An essential element of Philo’s writings is their strong religious charac- ter with the dogmatic content of the Jewish monotheistic, transcendent con- cept of God. Although in his interpretation of the Scriptures, in order to achieve his apologetic and rhetorical purposes, Philo uses heterogeneous philosophical themes (Platonism, Pythagoreanism, Stoicism), in fact his ideas are not without coherence. Platonism and Pythagoreanism constitute the main elements of his theological thoughts (negative theology, Middle Platonic attributes), but there is insufficient evidence of direct influences of Antiochus of Ascalon or Eudorus on </page> <page sequence="162">  part two the Jewish thinker. The third section of the chapter discusses Philo’s anthropol- ogy and his ethical and spiritual teaching (–).

This is the first monograph devoted to an account of Philo’s thought from a theosophical perspective. After two introductory chapters on Philo’s life and his writings, the author introduces the allegorical method used by Philo, illustrating it by giving an account of the allegorization of the ark of the covenant. After this a chapter follows on the development of the Kabbalistic tree of the ten divine emanations (Sefirot) from Rabbi Hillel to the Zohar. Five chapters are then devoted to central aspects of Philonic doctrine: the Deity; the immaterial world; the structure of the universe; the structure of the human soul; the original, functioning and final goal of the soul. The parallelism between the Kabbalistic tree and Philo’s theology and psychology is demonstrated through two diagrams on pp.  and . A brief chapter follows on a secret in the Septuagint, namely the significance of the twelve jewels on the High Priest’s λ γε( ν. This can only be explained here because it presupposes acquaintance with Philo’s psychology. In the climactic chapter of the book the relation between Philo and the Kabbalah is explained. Two texts that demonstrate this link are Her. , ,  (on the Menorah) and Fug. – (on the six cities of refuge). The author is unable to determine, however, whether Philo used the Kabbalistic schema consciously or unconsciously. A final chapter elaborates on the relation between Philo’s theology and psychology and the much older Hindu Advaita-Vedanta school. The author claims that it is startling how great the parallelism is. (DTR) 20171. G. E. Sterling (ed.),TheAncestralWisdom:Hellenistic Philoso- phy in Second Temple Judaism.

Starting from Martin Hengel’s thesis that all Judaism (i.e., both Palestinian and the Diaspora) from about the middle of the third century b.c.e. is to be con- sidered hellenized Judaism, the author sets himself the task of testing the hypoth- esis that while all Jews were hellenized, the specifics of their Hellenization varied markedly, the most important of the variables controlling the extent of Hell- enization being the community to which an individual Jew belonged and its sit- uation within the larger Graeco-Roman world.The hypothesis is tested by com- paring Jerusalem andAlexandria c.  b.c.e.– c.e. under three headings: the political-social situations, linguistic practices, and the social-religious practices of the communities. Obviously, Philo is often cited as source.The overview of the evidence confirms the hypothesis.

After sketching the status quaestionis with regard to the possible relation- ship between Philo and the Epistle to the Hebrews, the author formulates his intention with this article as follows: to ‘address the relationship between Pla- tonic ontology and Christian eschatology in Hebrews by examining the use of the tabernacle in Heb :–:’. A detailed analysis of Heb :–, :–, ;, :– and : is followed by a discussion of the tabernacle in Philo (includ- ing a comparison with Josephus’ description) and in apocalyptic traditions. In Hebrews a vertical/spatial orientation (in line with Platonic ontology) and a linear/temporal orientation (of Christian eschatology) can be distinguished. The author is ‘convinced that the spatial dimension is indebted to Platonizing exegetical traditions’. His conclusion is that Hebrews ‘does not reflect a profound understanding of Platonism; it only betrays a knowledge of Platonizing exegeti- cal traditions. ( . . . ) It indicates that Platonism (. . . ) had become common coin in some exegetical circles among Jews and Christians. Thismeans that Philo should not be read as a solitary figure, but as the most sophisticated representative of a larger tradition of exegesis.’ (HMK) 20175. J. E.

The author discusses texts from Acts about the community of life among the first Christians. They had a radical form of common life and property. This description is compared with Philo’s text about the Essenes in the Hypothetica preserved by Eusebius (PE .). Taylor concludes that the way of life of the Christians as described in Acts closely resembles that of the Essenes. (ACG) 20176. J. E.

Philo’s De vita contemplativa is a highly rhetorical piece and it is valuable to explore the relation between the rhetoric and the historical reality to which it points. Taylor’s article, which explores themes dealt with at greater length in her subsequent monograph (see below ), focuses on the role of women in Philo’s account. It is plain that Philo’s purpose was to describe the members of the Therapeutae community as ‘good’. But how could he do this in the case of the women members and at the same time hold on to his own gender theory, in which women were regarded as less philosophical? In the first part of the article Philo’s conception of women in general is treated. The </page> <page sequence="165"> critical studies   author observes that, in spite of the negative presentation given of ‘feminine’ characteristics of the soul, there is something strangely powerful about the fem- inine that remains in Philo’s construction. Next Taylor discusses the role of the women as students of Moses. It is unlikely that their presence would be regarded positively, since women philosophers were generally seen in a negative light in the context of philosophical schools. The final part of the article focuses on two characteristics of the portrayal of the women, first that they are in some way maternal, secondly that they are celibate and are described as virgins (but this is likely not to have been literally the case). Here, however, Philo’s rhetoric may not have been pure apologetics. It is possible that the notion of being spiritu- ally fruitful through celibacy was an ideal that the community itself embraced. Taylor concludes by emphasizing that in Philo’s presentation the theme of gen- der remains and has not been blurred by celibacy or spiritual achievement. (DTR) 20177. N. H. Taylor, ‘Popular Opposition to Caligula in Jewish Pales- tine,’ Journal for the Study of Judaism  () –. Caligula’s order to construct a statue of himself for the Jerusalem Temple pro- voked effective popular protests among Judeans and Galileans, who confronted the local Roman ruler Petronius on two separate occasions. Philo and Josephus, the main sources about this crisis, represent elite interests opposed to such pop- ular movements. Although both writers discuss these movements, Philo and Josephus attribute resolution of the crisis to Agrippa’s intervention and to the subsequent assassination of Caligula. Taylor attempts to identify the composi- tion, leadership, and motivations of the popular groups. The Judeans may have been led by prophetic figures drawn from priestly and scribal classes, while the Galileans, consisting primarily of farmerswho abandoned their agricultural pur- suits, may have been led by a popular prophetic figure or figures. Both groups, motivated by piety and devotion to theTemple,may have been inspired by escha- tological expectations of divine intervention. (EB) 20178. C. Termini, ‘La creazione come APXH della legge in Filone di Alessandria (Opif. –),’ Rivista Biblica  () –. Philo’s treatise De opificio mundi should not be placed before Legum Allego- riae, the beginning of the Allegorical Commentary on Genesis—where it has habitually been placed since Mangey’s edition—but should be placed at the beginning of the Exposition of the Law. There are two main reasons for this: () the form of the treatise itself, which does not have the structure of a sequen- tial commentary giving a lemma by lemma analysis, but rather the aspect of an exposition or paraphrase of Gen :–:, without a connection to the next trea- tise (Leg.), and () because the opening section of Opif., and indeed the entire treatise inasmuch as it is dedication to the creation account, presents itself as a proemium ( ρ1 ) to the revealed Laws. Of fundamental importance for Ter- mini’s argument is research into the cultural context to which Philo makes ref- erence in a quite polemical manner, i.e. in his opening remarks, which refer to </page> <page sequence="166">  part two legislators who either show little respect for the subject of the Laws or invest them with a mythical character which undermines their credibility. Needless to say Moses’  ρ1  does not fall into either camp, but assumes a philosophical principle as its basis. The author is well aware of the influence of Plato’s views on the role of the proemium (Laws e–a) which is particularly visible atMos. .–, as well as the principle of harmony between κ σμ ς and ν μ ςwhich is typical of the Stoics, and especially Chrysippus. The Torah, by assimilating and synthesizing these models, rises above them and is able to assume a universal character. (RR) 20179. J. L. Thompson,Writing the Wrongs. Women of the Old Testa- ment among Biblical Commentators from Philo through the Reformation, Oxford Studies in Historical Theology (Oxford ), esp. –. This study examines how the stories of Hagar (Gen ), Jephthah’s daughter (Judg :–), and the Levite’s concubine (Judg –) were interpreted from the first century until the sixteenth and seventeenth. Philo sees inHagar a symbol of preliminary or encyclical studies. She functions as a ‘handmaid’ of virtue in its purest form, symbolized by Sarah. In this allegory Philo exalts and denigrates Hagar at the same time. As a concubine she stands below a wife, but she is important on the philosophical level: she is necessary for the acquisition of virtue. Philo’s interpretation of Hagar is taken over by Clement of Alexandria. Origen and Didymus the Blind combine the Philonic interpretation with Paul’s exegesis from Gal . Gregory of Nyssa’s picture of Hagar is more Pauline than Philonic. Ambrose follows Philo: Sarah represents virtue, whereas Hagar is the wisdom of the world. (ACG) 20180. T. H.

The testimony of Philo, esp. in Legat., is of fundamental importance in correcting certain fixed theories on the genesis of Christianity, even if up to now it has been little used. The value of Philo in this case is due to the fact that Legat. gives a precise picture of the variety—geographical, linguistic and cultural—of the Jewish community in the Diaspora, and also helps us to understand the influence that Philonic thought may have exerted on Paul. Finally, Legat. also helps us reconstruct the context in which the Gospels were spread, because it gives us a picture of the condition of the Jews of Rome and of the Empire at the time of the Embassy. This community undoubtedly reveals a variety of attitudes towards the Laws because it was time and time again constrained to make compromises with the Roman and the imperial authorities. These differences were determinative for the diversity of reactions on the part of Jewish communities towards Christianity. (RR) 20183. J. D.

There is undoubtedly a direct relation between certain Philonic texts (espe- cially QG . and Agr. –, both cited in an appendix), and Plato’s Phaedrus. Noteworthy is the role of the ‘bit’ in the relation between the rider and the horse. It is used to indicate the role of a brake on the passions and the mastery that the intellectual part should exercise on all that belongs to the senses. But in Philo’s exegesis of the myth of the flying chariot of the Phaedrus his own views on sen- suality also emerge. It is given a negative value in the moral and intellectual per- spective (basically it is regarded as the origin of sin), but a positive value as an essential aspect of creation. (RR) 20186. H. C. Waetjen, ‘Logos pros ton Theon and the Objectification of Truth in the Prologue of the FourthGospel,’Catholic Biblical Quarterly  () –. Philo is seen to be the first person to give expression to the uniting together of the biblical Word of God and the Greek Logos with the resulting objectification of truth as correct seeing rather than hearing. Philo’s objectification of truth was appropriated by the Gospel of John, which attempted in the Prologue of the Gospel to refute Philo’s platonically-orientedmetaphysics. Philo’s understanding of the Logos and its activity is thus contrasted with that of the Gospel of John. (KAF) 20187. R.

() The Torah is understood as universal law, known to all human beings as normative guide to action, which can be performed. () The Torah is also the inner unity of a universal and fundamental ordering of the cosmos, making it a ‘religion for humanity’ (D. Georgi).

In the Introduction the translator briefly recounts the role of Philo in the work, without giving a detailed analysis. The main discussion of Philo occurs in chapters  to  in Section  of PartThree entitled Words of Understanding. Chapter  recounts ‘the commend- able aspects’ of his works which are compatible with the Torah. Chapter  out- lines ‘four defects’ which can be brought against Philo. Chapter  offers ‘a plausi- ble defence’ against these charges and gives a final verdict on him. He concludes (p. ): ‘In view of all that has been written in this chapter, I say to the Jewish people that I cannot pass an unconditional verdict on [him]. I cannot absolutely absolve or convict him. I shall call him neither Rav nor sage, heretic nor sceptic. My only name for him shall be Yedidyah [beloved of the Lord] the Alexandrian. Whenever he is mentioned in these chapters, it will not be as an intimate mem- ber of my people, but as any other sage of the world to whom a hearing will be given when hemakes general statements and has no vested interest in the subject . . . ’ There are, in accordance with this conclusion, frequent references to Philo in the remaining parts of the work, which can be tracked down via the index of sources on pp. –.

The phrase νυν  δ  is explored in the writings of the Septuagint, Josephus and Philo. These texts served as the background to Paul.

The assumption commonly held that those who deny resurrection (Cor :) did so because they enthusiastically anticipated the last things or because of a spiritualisic tendency contemptuous of the body, is not supported by the argument that follows in the chapter. The latter position is often reconstructed with the help of Philo. This raises the question whether Paul necessarily became acquainted with certain anthropological terms via the so called Alexandrian dualistic wisdom. The motifs of the deniers hardly can be correlated with the enthusiasts sarcastically criticized in Cor : nor with the supposed liberal slogan at Cor :ab. Consequently caution is advised for those who want to assume an uniform front in Corinth and who exploit the writings of Philo for this purpose.

Tougher (ed.), Eunuchs in Antiquity and Beyond (London ) –. The article examines Philo’s interpretation of Joseph in order to gain a better understanding of his views on gender relations, castration, eunuchism and circumcision. Philo’s views of gender relations are complex because views on the differences between male and female are combined with the notion of spiritual progress in which the female can be left behind, but the soul can also receive the divine seed. After some general observations on Philo’s interpretation of eunuchism, the article concentrates on the figure of Joseph. Just like the Rabbis, Philo is sensitive to ambiguities in the figure of Joseph as he appears in the biblical narrative. He can be read both negatively (indulging in pleasure) and positively (rejecting passion). The latter interpretation runs parallel to his allegorization of circumcision. Ultimately Philo’s gender hierarchy guarantees that the figure of the eunuch must always be subject to slippage back into the passive realm of sensuality. Philo thus prefigures debates about the role of self- mutilation in early Christianity. (DTR) 20202. V. Alfaro Bech, and V. E.

The monograph contends that in Cor :–: Paul, when he compares himself with Moses, uses the metamorphosis motif to convince the Corinthians about his legitimacy as an apostle. In her examination of Jewish-Hellenistic texts Back explains Philo’s reports of the metamorphosis ofMoses (Mos. .–) and Abraham (Virt. –) as a phenomenon of charismatic and prophetic enthu- siasm. The authority of the mediator of divine revelation (Offenbarungsmittler) is underlined, the divinity of his message confirmed and the development of his spiritual perfection documented.

Philo’s commentary on one of the dreams of Joseph (Gen :–) is of particular interest for the study of the symbolismof colours.The author proposes a first interpretation of the three σημε(α: τ4 δι λευκ ν, τ4 π ικ λ ν and τ4 σπ δ ειδPς Qαντ ν in relation to Jacob, the symbol of the  σκητ ς, who attains to wisdom through practice, but at the time of the dream has not yet reached the goal of his spiritual itinerary (§§–). A second interpretation is then given: the same signs, but now in reverse order, are related to the High Priest, the symbol of the τ λει ς, the man who has attained wisdom (§§–). The three signs this time represent the three stages in an ascent that can be described as mystical. Attached to this second part is also a digression on the politician, represented by Joseph (§§–), who only has access to the intermediate sign, the π ικ λ ν, which has a negative connotation.

Barclay points out the ambiguities and difficulties presented by use of the term ‘apologetics’. In his original History, E. Schürer viewed Jewish apologetic literature as primarily defensive in refuting anti-Jewish claims, and he distin- guished between apologetics and propaganda, which sought either to proselytize or to create a positive impression of Jews. In his revision of Schürer, M. Good- man, influenced by V. Tcherikover’s seminal article, acknowledges that much Jewish apologetic literature may have been intended for Jews and not aimed at </page> <page sequence="173"> critical studies   Gentiles at all. Goodman also distinguishes between general Jewish apologetics and different kinds of ‘missionary’ purposes that include information, educa- tion, apologetics, and proselytization. As Barclay observes, apologetics may be direct or indirect. The term ‘apologetics’ raises complex issues related to actual and implied readers of Jewish works, oral and written apologetics, and apologet- ics and proselytism. Some scholars with a Christian perspective may overlook that so-called apologetic literature may have a variety of aims, as suggested by Goodman, not just full proselytism. Although Barclay mentions Philo only in passing, his article has direct relevance for the questions of Philo’s audience(s) and intentions. (EB) 20207. L. Baynes, ‘Personification, and the Transformation of Gram- matical Gender,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. Philo saw grammatical gender as philosophically important, but this cre- ated a problem when a word’s grammatical gender and its true nature con- flicted. Fug. – is illustrative (cf. Abr. –; QG .). Rebecca’s father is Bathouel, which etymologically means ‘daughter of God’. Philo asks how the female ‘daughter of God’, Wisdom, which is grammatically feminine, can in nature be masculine. Contrary to Sly (RRS ), Baynes shows that Philo was not the only ancient to wrestle with the significance of grammatical gender and, although Philo does not have a systematically consistent and sustained philos- ophy of language, he nevertheless draws on Stoic linguistic theory to resolve this conflict. Philo enters the nature/convention debate and in almost complete agreement with the Stoics comes down on the side of convention. Names were given by human imposition but, and here is the qualification, the names given reflect the nature of things (cf. Opif. –). Philo and the Stoics only part company in the identity of the namegiver. For the Stoics it was wise men, for Philo it was the wise man Adam (Leg. .). With the Stoics, Philo believed that language gradually underwent corruption with the addition and subtraction of letters to words. As a result, grammatical gender now deceives by obstructing meaning rather than clarifying it. Through etymology as practised by the Stoics and Philo nouns can be divested of their feminine grammatical gender so they conform to their true meaning and fit Philo’s philosophical schema.

In this study on spirit and wisdom in the Gospel of John, a chapter is devoted to Philo and other Jewish writers. In Philo’s thought πνεupsilontildeμα is seen as the essence of the rational soul breathed in by God. Because πνεupsilontildeμα is given by God, it functions as the principle of communication between God and man. It provides the basis for knowing and seeing God. Philo argues, however, that God cannot be known in himself, but only through the lower levels of being.Wisdom </page> <page sequence="174">  part two is a guide on the way to the understanding of God.

The conviction that God was concerned for the world was generally current at the time of the rise of Christianity. In her study on the Christian apologetic literature of the nd and rd centuries Bergjanmakes some reference to the term πρ ν ια in Philo’s writings. For example Conf. , Det.  f. and Post.  are cited as the background of some ideas of the Church Fathers, especially those of Alexandria. Philo was one of the first who explained the nature of God with reference to his activity—as a general pattern of meaning, in terms of order or as individual care. It is a pity that in the monograph no attention was paid to Philo’s treatise on divine providence (Prov.) or the two political–apologetic ones (Flacc. and Legat.), where the idea of the divine providence is underlined in central passages. (GS) 20210. R. Bergmeier, ‘Der Stand der Gottesfreunde; zu Philos Schrift „Über die kontemplative Lebensform“,’ Bijdragen  () –. Usually scholarly interest in Philo’s De vita contemplativa is limited to the so- called Therapeutae as a distinctive group or community of Jewish sectarians, their identity and character, their Mareotic settlement and ascetic way of life. But Philo himself is not really engaged in giving an account of a historical community, for he writes a philosophical treatise on being wholly devoted to worship and contemplation (Contempl. , , , ). For this reason he does not describe, but actually defines that τ4  εραπευτικ4ν γ ν ς has consisted of those who aspire to ‘the contemplation of the Being’ (§; cf. Plato, Rep. c) and in this way obtain complete felicity. At the end of the treatise (§) this idea is taken up again in idealizing words about being true philosophers, i.e. friends of God, a gift of God that affords true virtue and leads to the height of felicity. Philo presents the contemplative manner of living by telling about the so-called Therapeutae. In doing so he uses different traditions and sources that allow him to present an apparently historical community: (a) remarks that actually refer to Jewish life and institutions in general; (b) the source on the Essenes which he already used when writing Prob. – and Hypoth. .–; (c) another source on the Essenes, not used before, but also known to Josephus and Pliny, not Pythagorean, but presenting the Essenes in a Pythagorean perspective. The common features of the Therapeutae and the Essenes thus represent Philo’s version of the matter, and hisTherapeutae are the paradigm of the philosophical manner of living that Philo wants to promulgate. Jews, at least the best of them, he wishes to say, are those people who belong to God’s friendship and spend all their virtuous life in meditation and worship (Contempl. , ; cf. Praem. –).

In the th century, in response to the accusations of misanthropy originally formulated in the literature of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, a new defence of the ‘philanthropy’ of the Laws of Moses was developed. This defence shows continuity with the apologetics of Philo and Josephus, but is also radically different in the way it interprets the biblical concept of ger, the resident stranger. In the st century of our era Jewish philanthropy is expressed in the welcome accorded to proselytes. In contrast in the th century the term designates a stranger who is not converted to Judaism and the philanthropy consist in guaranteeing his safety within the Jewish community without demanding his conversion. The author demonstrates that in both cases the cultural context influences the interpretation. In antiquity this occurs through praise of Roman philanthropy, in the th century through the idea of tolerance. (JR) 20212. K. Berthelot, ‘Philo and Kindness towards Animals (De Virtutibus –),’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The paper demonstrates howPhilo in response to accusations ofmisanthropy against the Jewish people argues apologetically that the Law ofMoses commands Jews to behave in humane ways toward all human beings. Applying the a minori ad maius argument to Deut :, Philo argues that if Jews are commanded in the law to extend gentleness and goodness to animals, then all the more so will they extend justice to all humans. Berthelot says that the ‘ass’ of Deut : does not signify proselytes as Colson supposed (LCL) but non-Jews in general. Extending kindness to animals becomes a form of training for the practice of  ιλαν ρωπ α toward humans. That this same argument inVirt. – can be seen in Plutarch and Sotion, as reported by Seneca, suggests that this a minori admaius argument waswell-known before Philo and was Pythagorean in origin.

The author suggests that a common assumption inmany studies of the Jewish Diaspora is the certainty of Jewish ethnic continuity in Diaspora settings. This view, Bohak claims, is based on the experiences of the mediaeval Jewish Dias- pora, and is a model that should be challenged as a key to understanding the Jewish Diaspora in antiquity. According to Bohak, Jewish continuity in Dias- pora settings cannot be taken for granted, and in some cases itmay have been the exception, not the rule.The author first investigates the Thessalian Demetrias— which attracted many foreigners—focusing especially on the Phoenician immi- grants; then he deals with the works of Philo, the Egyptian Chora and the land </page> <page sequence="176">  part two of Onias. Especially interesting for Philonists is his exposition of Flacc. –. Bohak’s own conclusion is that the often implicit assumption that the commu- nities of the Jewish Diaspora thrived from one generation to the next flies in the face of what we know about the fate of immigrants in the ancient world—and of some of the Jewish evidence as well.

Characteristic of the Gnostic movement is a double theology: a distinction between the highest, unknown and invisible God, who is truly good, and a lower God, who creates the cosmos. According to Bos, Philo is an important figure in the development of this gnostic belief. In the beginning of Opif. he rejects the world-view of the Chaldeans, who consider the created cosmos to be God. Bos refers to this view as cosmic-theology, whereas Philo, believing in a transcendent God, represents a meta-cosmic theology. The author also discusses Abr. –, in which Abraham is commanded to free himself from the Chaldean world- view. The metaphor of awaking from a deep sleep, used by Philo, is—directly or indirectly—borrowed from Aristotle. (ACG) 20215. F.

Philo in some passages speaks of God as being unnameable, but in other passages of human beings as being unable to know the name of God. The author therefore poses the problem whether in Philo’s view () God does not reveal his name (because it is such as humans are not able to know it) or whether () God does not have a name (because of his nature). Her conclusion is that Philo expresses himself along the lines of the first hypothesis when he is quoting and commenting on a biblical text, whereas in (much more numerous) expositions more or less independent from biblical passages he develops the second hypothesis (for which cf. Plato’s Parmenides). The second problem the author discusses is the relation among the via negationis, via eminentiae and via analogiae, all of which can be found in Philo’s discourse. Here she concludes that for Philo the three ways are not mutually exclusive or incompatible: they are three different modes, not of how God relates to the world, but of how human beings relate to God.

Reference is also made to Aristotle’s Physics,De generatione animalium andDe partibus, not to speak of numerous allusions to Stoicism. Such references, however, are used for the purpose of interpreting the biblical text, e.g. the clarifi- cation of difficulties inherent in the double account of creation, the explanation of creation as act of divine will, the providential role of God etc. In addition the doctrine of the Powers must be seen in the context of the Jewish prohibition of pronouncing the divine Name and the double appellation of God and Lord in the Bible. The article focuses in particular on the passages in Opif. dealing with the simultaneous creation of the cosmos, the divine Model of which the empirical world is a copy, the role of the Architect of the cosmos, as well as the representation of the Divine powers in Cher., Abr. and Deo.

The article studies the theatrical metaphors present in Flacc., the numerous references to mimics and actors, and the presentation of public life as a great spectacle in which the main figures present themselves publicly. As background the author recalls the cross-currents between theatre and political oratory in Greek literature of the th and th century b.c.e., the negative view of Plato, who considered theatre as a place of fiction, and the Stoic use of the metaphor of the actor. The article presents the evidence for the exhibitionism and villainy of Flaccus, which is echoed by the games and contests in the circus, while the reversal that takes place in the theatre is represented by the farce of Carabas. Philo views the theatre in a negative light, seeing it as characterized by falsity and obscurity. Apart from the traditional Jewish hesitation towards the theatre, Platonic influences probably also play a role here. Opposed to the negative representation of the deceivers is the dignified ‘spectacle’ of the persecuted Jews. The account taken as a whole is negative, presenting the protagonist as similar to a mimic or an actor. There is a reversal in relation to the Stoic metaphor of the actor.The virtuous individual consents to the choices he has carried out. He does not recite his life but lives it.

What interests him is to assert and demonstrate the legitimacy of the Law of Moses. Prototype and model of the true king is Moses, the lawgiver. In first century Alexandria the Mosaic Law needed to be defended: Philo underlines its eternity, necessity and truth in respect of other laws.The Law is one and contains all there is to know about the relationships between God, cosmos and man and about the relationships between men. Human kingdoms and governments come and go, what counts is concordance with the will and the Law of God. (HMK) 20220. C. Carlier, La Cité de Moïse: la représentation du peuple juif chez Philon d’Alexandrie (diss. Sorbonne, Paris IV ). This doctoral dissertation was prepared under the supervision of Prof. Mo- nique Alexandre and defended in June .The basis of the study is a philologi- cal investigation of the terms used to describe the city as a community of persons (π λ της, π λιτεupsilonacuteω–π λιτεupsilonacute μαι, π λ τευμα, π λιτε α—π λις had been cov- ered in an earlier unpublished study). On this basis conclusions are reached on how Philo as a Hellenized Jew conceives the community of the Jewish people in terms of the Hellenistic conception of the city. The dissertation consists of five chapters. The first examines the use of π λ της and π λιτε α in relation to the Jews in non-Jewish authors such as Hecataeus, Manetho, Nicholas of Dam- ascus and Strabo. In the second chapter Carlier examines various Hellenistic- Jewish writers before Philo and their use of the vocabulary of the city. In the last three chapters attention is fixed on Philo himself. Chapter three examines Philo’s use of institutional terminology when describing the city of Moses and the members of its community. Chapter four examines the conceptual termi- nology used to depict the relations between the members of the city of Moses, notably  ιλ α, κ ινων α, 8σ ν μ α. The fifth chapter turns to the philosophical use of the vocabulary of the city, examining the link between city and cosmol- ogy, the concept of the κ σμ π λ της, the connection between citizenship and virtue and the concept of God as only citizen. In an appendix a commentary is given on Legat. – which describes Jerusalem as *ερ π λις. The main conclusion of the study is that Philo’s conception of the Mosaic polity shows a community of Jews and proselytes held together by a common devotion to the laws of Moses, a community without a territory, but with the created reality of the cosmos as its spiritual home. In this conception Philo is influenced by </page> <page sequence="179"> critical studies   his reading, not only of Plato, but also of Aristotle’s political thought. To some degree he shows nostalgia for the institutions of the classical polis as set out in th century philosophical writings. But at the same time he stands in the middle of the volatile political situation of his own time, in which Alexandria is ruled from Rome. Philo thus combines being both a bookish figure and one who is very much involved in contemporary politics. In both cases his Jewish identity is paramount.

Cavadini, ‘Exegetical Transformations: the Sacrifice of Isaac in Philo, Origen, and Ambrose,’ in P. M. Blowers, A. Russell Christman, D. G. Hunter and R. D. Young (edd.), In Dominico Eloqui: In Lordly Eloquence. Essays on Patristic Exegesis in Honor of Robert Louis Wilken (Grand Rapids–Cambridge ) –. The author considers howOrigen and Ambrose receive and transform Philo’s interpretation of the #Aqedah (Gen :–). Philo understands Abraham to be an unwritten law, and his identity is closely bound up with God. He is therefore ‘always ready to renounce’—as shown by his willingness to leave home and to sacrifice his ‘beloved and only son’ (Abr. ). Answering ‘unnamed ‘quarrelsome critics” (Abr. ), Philo emphasizes Abraham’s obedience to God as the motivation behind his willingness to sacrifice Isaac. Philo also allegorizes the story to mean that the sage must sacrifice his joy to God, i.e., recognize that ‘his joy is only in God’ (p. ). Origen focuses on Abraham as an archetype of faith—rather than of law, as in Philo—ready to give up his identity by sacrificing God’s promises, an act that may suggest martyrdom on Abraham’s part. Origen’s Abraham is also ‘a kind of figure for God the Father’ (p. ), and Isaac and the ram are figures for Christ. Ambrose builds on and transforms elements from Origen and Philo, but in Ambrose’s exegesis, Isaac plays the primary role as a type for Christ, and Abraham becomes a mere onlooker. Cavadini ends with some reflections on how to evaluate ‘precritical’ exegesis and observes that, because Ambrose minimizes the role of Abraham as depicted in the biblical narrative, his exegesis ‘seems less successful’ than that of Philo and Origen (p. ).

Besides Clement’s synthesis of sources, Choufrine discusses his </page> <page sequence="180">  part two continuity and discontinuity with earlier Christian thinking, and his orthodoxy. Philo appears primarily in Chapter  (‘Theophany as Light’), which includes Clement’s revision of the Philonic idea of Abram’s conversion, Philo’s notion of the eternal Day, an Aristotelian background for his idea of illumination, and his ontology of light.

Kugel (ed.), Shem in the Tents of Japheth: Essays on the Encounter of Judaism and Hellenism, Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism  (Leiden ) –. The author aims to show that in the case of several rather common Greek words, Philo found a Judeo-Greek connotation (related to their general con- notation, but not the same) ready to hand. The terms discussed are ν μ ς and ν μ  εσ α (=Torah),παρ δ σις (= ancestral traditions), δ γμα (= rule), δικαι-  σupsilonacuteνη (= faithful adherence to Torah statutes), and most extensively σ   α and λ γ ς (= Torah).The author goes on to argue that these Judeo-Greek terms were once again redefined by early Christianity and these re-definitionswere accepted by scholars as their primary connotation. This explains why they have so often been misconstrued by Philonic scholars. (HMK) 20224. I. Davidzon, ‘Il deserto nel De Vita Mosis di Filone Alessan- drino: possibilità di un’ascesa etica e conoscitiva attraverso i prodigi,’ Materia guidaica  () –. The article deals with the meaning of the desert as seen in Philo’s Mos. It intends to show how the desert is not only a physical place but offers to human beings the possibility of rising to God. In this treatise there is a strict rela- tionship between the desert, suffering and divine intervention. In this context manna is the link between human beings and God. The human path towards God starts with the sufferings and the deprivations inflicted by the desert, but finally humans reach the contemplation of nature and the knowledge of God through the wonder of manna as divine manifestation.

De Souza–Filho, ‘The Maker’s Knowledge Principle and the Limits of Science,’ Proceedings of the American Catholic Philo- sophical Association  () –. In modern philosophy, the ‘maker’s knowledge argument’ denotes that peo- ple can know what they make. The argument can be construed positively—that people can indeed know what they make—or negatively—that people can know onlywhat they make.This understanding of human knowledge has implications for the definition of ‘scientific knowledge, which is thus separated from spec- ulative metaphysics and purely theoretical knowledge’ (p. ). Although it is widely assumed that the maker’s knowledge argument is not found in ancient </page> <page sequence="181"> critical studies   philosophy, the author argues that the Demiurge in Plato’sTimaeus has amaker’s knowledge of the universe, though this is a knowledge of ‘a technical, practical kind’ (p. ), rather than a metaphysical knowledge of unchanging forms and principles. Philo may have been the first to articulate the maker’s knowledge principle in relation to God. For Philo God, unlike Plato’s Demiurge, incorpo- rates the Platonic Form of the Good and therefore he has perfect knowledge that is both theoretical and practical. Christian thinkers further developed the explicit idea of God as creator ex nihilo. Originally attributed to God as creator, maker’s knowledge gradually came to be applied to humans and this application became the foundation of the maker’s knowledge argument in modern philoso- phy.

Morelli (edd.), «Sectes» et «hérésies» de l’Antiquité à nos jours, Problèmes d’histoire des religions  (Brussels ) –. The author aims to show that the concept of heresy (αJρεσις in Greek; the corresponding Latin term is secta) with its connotation of inciting repressive measures is late. In the case of Philo, who strives to present Judaism as the philosophical religion par excellence, he demonstrates that the way of life of the Therapeutae as described in Contempl. is highly spiritual and valorizes Judaism. In their case the use of the term αJρεσις is positive. (JR) 20227. J.M.Dillon, ‘TheEssenes inGreek Sources: SomeReflections,’ in J. R.

In this article, the author compares some aspects of the descriptions of the Essenes in Philo and Josephus with descriptions of the Qumranites in the Qumran scrolls.The aspects focused on are asceticism and rejection ofmarriage, community of life and property, and some various provisions like the total number of members, their clothes, swearing and the degree of determinism in their ideology. The author argues that neither Philo nor Josephus can count as first-hand witnesses. The evidence from Greco-Roman sources such as these very probably refer to the same groups as depicted in the Scrolls; but one should not expect a greater degree of accuracy than is generally characteristic of Greek sources of alien civilizations or customs.

The author pays special attention to how interpreters of the Joseph narra- tive are influenced by their religious and cultural settings. Besides an intro- duction and conclusion the article is divided into four sections: inner-biblical </page> <page sequence="182">  part two interpretation, covering Ps :– and Maccabees ; Hellenistic Jewish sources, including Artapanus, Joseph and Aseneth, and Josephus’ Jewish Antiq- uities; Palestinian Jewish sources, including Jubilees and Ps.Philo; and negative presentations of Joseph, including those of Philo (p. ) and Genesis Rabbah. Most of these depictions of Joseph are quite positive and highlight his resistance to Potiphar’s wife and his exalted position in Egypt.Themes that reflect the con- cerns of authors and readers include ‘the issue of intermarriagewithGentiles, the continuing validity of the Jewish law and the need to promote unity’ (p. ). Philo is not discussed among the Hellenistic Jewish texts but only under the section on negative interpretations. His treatment of Joseph is positive in Ios., in which he stresses Joseph’s powerful position in Egypt, and more negative in Somn., in which he calls attention to Joseph’s arrogance and instability, perhaps as a way of criticizing contemporary Roman rulers.

It is very unlikely that Philo exerted influence on the exegesis that Augustine gives of Gen :– as he read it in the Vetus Latina.

Dyck, ‘Philo, Alexandria and Empire: the Politics of Allegorical Interpretation,’ in J. R. Bartlett (ed.), Jews in the Hellenstic and Roman Cities (London ) –. The aim of the article is to explore the cultural and political dimensions of allegorical interpretation as it is evidenced by the works of Philo, especially the way in which it is embedded in the cultural politics of Alexandria on the one side, and the imperial politics on the other. The essay takes the form of critical reflections on David Dawson’s cultural critical reading of Philo, using Daniel Boyarin as a third dialogue partner. The focus throughout the article, however, is primarily on the work of Dawson, and the author reaches some different conclusions. Far from revising Greek culture and imperial politics, Dyck suggests, Philo in actual fact endorses it. To him, Philo represents ‘a form of Judaism which had come to terms with a high degree of socio-cultural and political assimilation and acculturation. Furthermore, it accommodated Judaism to the dominant culture via practices such as allegorical interpretation without abandoning its distinctive traditions and practices’ (p. ). (TS) 20231. G.

These themes signify the dynamism of the interior life.The second part of the thesis emphasizes those moral situations that humans have at their disposal in order for that interior life to follow its course, a life which is the locus of a struggle of the soul with herself. The third part clarifies how the human being can put an end to this struggle or at least not be overwhelmed. It emphasizes the importance of ‘working on oneself ’ (‘travail sur soi’) for Philo, a process that takes place not only through effort and conversion, but also through a new- found understanding of ‘knowledge of the self ’ (‘connaissance de soi’) as quest for the Other in oneself (‘l’Autre en soi’). (JR) 20232. L. H. Feldman, ‘The Death of Moses, according to Philo,’ Estudios Bíblicos  () –. This article deals with several aspects of the presentation of Moses by Philo, includingMoses’ alleged divinity. Philo is reluctant to call Moses divine, because this epithet was used for the Roman emperors. In addition, Philo tries to refute the story of Moses’ bodily ascension to heaven and his apotheosis. At his death Moses’ whole being is transformed into mind and is thus immortal, but he does not become God. In Exod : Moses is said to become ‘as God to Pharaoh’ but Philo allegorically interprets God as referring to the mind, which is God to the unreasoning part. Moses is the most perfect man and is a level higher than Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He is the wise man who possesses all the virtues. Being neither God nor man, he stands on the borderline between the uncreated and creation, just as the High priest is less than God but superior to humans. Moses is not God but is called friend of God. He is a partner of God, and enters the darkness that is God’s invisible existence. (ACG) 20233. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo’s Version of the #Aqedah,’ The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. This paper describes Philo’s treatment of the binding of Isaac at Abr. – and investigates reasons that motivated Philo’s shaping of the biblical narrative of Gen :–. Philo’s omissions and additions to the biblical account are due to the fact that he wrote his narrative to defend Abraham in the face of non- Jewish critics whominimized Abraham’s deed and accused Jews of misanthropy. Philo does not mention the physical binding of Isaac, for example, as that probably would have seemed excessive to aGreek audience andwould have been incriminating for Abraham. (KAF) 20234. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo’s View of Moses’ Birth and Upbringing,’ Catholic Biblical Quarterly  () –. In Mos. Philo presents Moses as a representative of the perfect king, and in describing Moses’ life he follows the method of ancient biographies, discussing his descent, childhood and education. He emphasizes the excellence of Moses’ </page> <page sequence="184">  part two parents, who are both Levites, and dramatizes the story of the abandonment of Moses by his parents. Retelling the narrative, he refers several times to the role of divine providence in the rescue of Moses. A typical motif in the biography of a hero is his exceptional physical and intellectual development, his beauty, and his self-restraint.Thismotif occurs in Philo as well, who narrates that Moses was educated by teachers from Greece and Egypt, and that he quickly surpassed his teachers’ intellect. It is noteworthy that he is educated in the same subjects as the philosopher-king in Plato’s Republic. In contrast to Josephus, Philo recounts the story of the killing of an Egyptian overseer by Moses, giving justification for Moses’ deed, but he does not speak about the two Israelites fighting. (ACG) 20235. L. H. Feldman, ‘The Plague of the First-born Egyptians in Rabbinic Tradition, Philo, Pseudo-Philo, and Josephus,’ Revue biblique  () –. Feldman addresses the questionhow theRabbis, Philo, Ps.Philo, and Josephus cope with the fact that God, in slaying the first-born in Egypt, kills innocent people and animals. Philo underscores that God kills the first-born only, and not the whole nation. Moreover, the children embodied the vices of their parents. He avoids the problemof the justification of punishing innocent children for the sins of their fathers. With regard to the Flood and the destruction of Sodom, Philo remarks that the people performed so many wicked deeds that they deserved punishment. In discussing the war with the Amalekites he passes over the command to annihilate them. (ACG) 20236. L. H. Feldman, ‘The Portrayal of Phinehas by Philo, Pseudo- Philo, and Josephus,’ Jewish Quarterly Review  () –. Philo discusses Phinehas in eight treatises. Acknowledging that the multi- tude would consider Phinehas a murderer for killing Zimri and Cozbi the Mid- ianite, Philo—in contrast—praises Phinehas for his zeal. He also considers as well-deserved the reward of peace bestowed on Phinehas by God. In committing murder Phinehas kept others from apostasizing. On the symbolic level, ‘Zimri and Cozbi represent passion and mere appearance, while Phinehas represents sincerity, truth, reason, and intelligence’ (p. ). Ps.Philo greatly expands the role of Phinehas, whose activities extend from the Exodus to the time of the Judges. Josephus’ treatment of Phinehas, however, is influenced by contempo- rary factors and his own situation. A priest who sympathized with Rome and disdained the Zealots of his day, Josephus does not call Phinehas a zealot and does not mention the reward he received for taking the initiative to do violence. Instead Josephus depicts him as a hero who took the law into his own hands to halt Zimri—a figure possibly reminiscent of Josephus’ own contemporaries— who intermarried and flouted Moses’ authority.

At Mos. .–, Philo drops any mention of God hardening Sihon’s heart and the divine mandate to destroy all men, women and children. Only soldiers are put to death. Moreover, the Israelites had justice on their side in view of how their emissaries were treated. At Leg. .–, the story is treated allegorically with Sihon being equated with Sophists. Philo does not treat the elimination of Og and his people. (KAF) 20238. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo’s Version of the Biblical Episode of the Spies,’ Hebrew Union College Annual  () –. This paper describes Philo’s non-allegorical treatment of the episode of the spies in Num – atMos. .–. Although brief in length, Philo’s version closely parallels Josephus’ treatment but contains several revisions due to theo- logical problems and aspects in the biblical text that could cause embarrassment. Philo focuses on Moses and his qualities of leadership. As a general Moses takes responsibility for the decision to reconnoitre the land and he alone chooses the spies. Sensitive to the charge that Israelites might be accused of theft, Philo omits Moses’ instruction to the spies to take fruit from the land. He also leaves out the dialogue between Moses and God in which God threatens to annihilate the Israelites as this would make Moses more merciful than God. (KAF) 20239. C. B.

Prin- cipalities, Powers and the Elements of theWorld in theirHellenistic Con- text,’ Journal for the Study of the New Testament  () –, esp. – . As part of an investigation of what Paul means with his terminology of ‘prin- cipalities and powers’, the author examines Philo’s theological use of the term δυν μεις. A large number of passages are quoted and it is concluded that Philo’s doctrine is not fully consistent (and is exacerbated for the reader by inconsistent use of capital letters for ‘Powers’/‘powers’ in translation). The tendency to create personified abstractions for and around God is not idiosyncratic and peculiar to Philo, but is also common in Middle Platonism, for example in an author such as Plutarch. Paul uses this terminology not just for purposes of communication, but as the result of personal synthesis of Hellenistic-Jewish and Greco-Roman thought. (DTR) 20240. F. Frazier, ‘Les visages de Joseph dans le De Josepho,’ The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. Although entitled Life of the Statesman, Philo’s bios of Joseph offers neither a reappraisal of the political world nor a transformation of the biblical Joseph into an ideal Greek π λιτικ ς. Instead we discover a series of tensions within </page> <page sequence="186">  part two the text. First, within the commentary sections of the treatise (§§–, –, –) the high moral value of the politicus is relativized by the ontological inferiority of the political world. Second, in the narrative sections of the treatise (§§–, –, –, –), the figure of Joseph displays a number of characteristics that belong to the pious biblical hero rather than to the π λιτικ ς of the commentary sections. Third, in the final narrative section and conclusion, Philo displaces the portrait of the commentary sections through two speeches of Joseph (§§– and –) and two final assessments (§§– and –). Can these different images of Joseph merge into a synthetic figure of an ideal politicus judaeus? Neither the composition of the text nor a comparison of Joseph with Moses suggest that they can. The politicus graecus is immersed in the material world and cannot be fully unified with Jewish piety. The figure of Joseph represents a distinctive spiritual experience.

This article focuses on the presentation of Moses as a Stoic sage and a Platonic philosopher-king in Philo. The four functions that Philo ascribes to Moses—philosopher-king, lawgiver, high priest, prophet—have a Stoic back- ground. Philo attributes Platonic–Stoic virtues to Moses, such as self-restraint, temperance, and justice. Describing Moses’ youth inMos., Philo depicts him as subduing the passions with self-control, just as a Stoic sage would do. When Moses stays in Midian he practices the theoretical life and tries to live according to the right reason of nature. Having attained the ideal of the Stoic sage totally, Moses is the sapiens, whereas his brother Aaron plays the role of the proficiens, who is still under way, unable to reach the final goal.

This book is a revised version of the author’s  Leiden doctoral disser- tation: see above . In the first part of this study, the author argues that Philo’s biography of Moses, Mos., is not part of the so-called Exposition of the </page> <page sequence="187"> critical studies   Law, as is usually assumed, but that it has to be compared with introductory lives (bioi) of philosophers. Examples of such bioi are the Lives of Democritus and Plato, written by Thrasyllus, and Porphyry’s Vita Plotini. A bios not only narrates the important facts of the philosopher’s life such as his descent, birth and death, but also discusses his writings. It is meant as an introduction to his philosophy. InMos. Philo recounts Moses’ life, but also relates the origin of the Greek translation of the books of Moses. In this way the treatise introduces readers without any knowledge of the Pentateuch to Mosaic philosophy, as more elaborately explained in the allegorical writings. Part II is an introduction to Gregory’s De vita Moysis, in which the author also deals with Gregory’s attitude towards Judaism. Gregory discerns a kinship between Philo and the neo-Arian Eunomius, because both do not ascribe being to the Logos, but only to God the Father. Gregory resists the view that the Logos is, in one way or another, subordinated to God. But at the same time there are similarities between Philo and Gregory in the doctrine of God, especially in the notion that God’s essence is incomprehensible for the human mind. Both show also a negative approach to the divine, which is expressed with alpha-privatives. In part III Geljon analyses the Philonic background of Gregory of Nyssa’s treatise. He distinguishes between Philonic phraseology on the one hand and exegesis derived fromPhilo on the other.On the level of phraseologyGregory offersmore than  borrowings from Philo, the greatest part of which are derived fromMos. The most important exegetical theme in which Gregory uses Philo’s exegesis is the interpretation of Egypt, Pharaoh, and the Exodus from Egypt. Like Philo, Gregory interprets Egypt as the land of the passions, Pharaoh as lover of the passions and the exodus as the liberation of the passions. Remarkably Origen, to whom Gregory is also indebted, does not offer this reading of Egypt. Other important exegetical themes which reveal Philo’s influence are the necessity of education, the interpretation of the serpent as a symbol of pleasure and the exegesis of the royal way. In all these themesGregory does not rely onPhilo’sMos. but draws on the treatises belonging to the Allegorical Commentary. Gregory does derive two interpretations from Philo’s Mos.: the dark blue of the high priest’s robe referring to the air; and the interpretation of the hardness of the nut of Aaron’s staff as a symbol of the austerity of the virtuous life. In the conclusion the author states that Gregory is not a slavish imitator of Philo, but an original and creative thinker and exegete. Reviews: G. Maspero, ScrTh  () – ; J. P.

The composition of some Philonic treatises and Talmudic tractates is char- acterized by ‘unity and coherence’ (p.  n. ). The authors recognize two connected principles of organization—anticipation and symmetry—described by J. Cazeaux in relation to Philonic treatises. According to the principle of </page> <page sequence="188">  part two symmetry, the beginning and end of a work are marked by ‘two fixed points, two sister-quotations for example’ (p. ). Anticipation, or teleological con- struction, describes the organization of a work whereby between the beginning and the end a chain of quotations and exegeses distract the reader, but the topic of the opening verse reappears at the end. Without arguing for any continu- ity between Philo and the Talmud, the authors observe that ‘the same tension between exegetical and homiletic foundations must have created the same pat- terns and structures in both sources’ (p. ). To illustrate the pattern of sym- metry and teleology, the authors analyze Philo’s Leg. and B. Qid a–a (the pattern may characterize the underlying Mishnaic chapter as well). Variations on the pattern in the Talmud are also discussed. Some observations by Philo about beginnings and ends are adduced to argue that symmetry and teleology were at the heart of both his composition and his philosophy. (EB) 20245. R. M. M.

Thefigure of the balance is part of a ‘conceptual andmetaphorical field’ which illustrates the notion of equilibrium for various points of view, from the stability of the wise person to the precarious and insecure situation of the one who yields to passion. In general the image gets used in the context of ethical values in order to represent the continual oscillation of foolish persons in opposition to the solidity of thosewho follow the ‘royal road’ that leads toGod.There is a direct link with the metaphor of the ship battered by the waves in order to indicate the tempest of the passions.

Essenism was a movement spread over the whole of Palestine, consisting of local communities in towns, villages or iso- lated spots; the Qumran community represents one of these, albeit with spe- cific characteristics and an independent development. TheTherapeutae formed a single community of limited dimensions and with peculiar characteristics: the presence of women, celibacy practiced by all members, preponderance of soli- tary contemplative activity, alternated by community meetings on the Sabbath and on the festival of the fiftieth day. While the Essenes and Qumran appear closely related (cf. the Groningen thesis), the community experience of the Therapeutae was independent and unique.

Jewish notions of Gentile impurity are integral to the understanding of group identity because these notions influence ideas about whether and how non-Jews can join the Jewish community. Indeed controversies on these questions ‘led to the rise of sectarianism in the Second Temple period and, ultimately, to the separation of Christianity and Judaism’ (p. ).Hayes identifies different kinds of purity/impurity, including ritual, moral, and genealogical. In Part I she examines concepts of Gentile impurity in the Bible and various Second Temple sources and then considers implications regarding intermarriage and conversion. She also examines the positions of Paul and early Church Fathers. Part II is devoted to rabbinic views of Gentile impurity, intermarriage, and conversion. Hayes argues against earlier scholars who claim that it is ritual impurity that Jews most commonly associate with non-Jews. Instead she maintains that it is genealogical purity that concerns Ezra, Jubilees, and QMMT, while other Second Temple sources, the Rabbis, and Paul emphasize the moral factor. Philo exemplifies this concern with moral—rather than ritual or genealogical—purity/impurity, and he understands conversion as ‘a passage from impiety to piety (moral impurity to moral purity)’ (p. ). Likewise Philo’s explanation of the prohibition against intermarriage is based on ‘the deleterious moral-religious effect it may have on the Israelite partner’ (p. ). Reviews: M. L.

A comparative study of the texts cited in the title of the article demonstrates that the form of the Decalogue that they represent stands closer to the version of Exodus than to that of Deuteronomy, and that this Decalogue is closer to the </page> <page sequence="191"> critical studies   LXX than the Masoretic text. In the case of Philo (cf. Decal. , , –) it appears that the order of commandments six to eight agrees with that of the LXX (Deut). But various indications presented by the author lead to the conclusion that Philo agrees more with the text of Exod than that of Deut.These indications are the elements specific to the text in Exod (cf. Decal. , –, , –). The elements of the Deuteronomy text are found in Decal. . On the basis of his enquiry the author concludes that Philo cites the text of the Decalogue from memory.

The article is a more discursive presentation of the material set out in full in the author’s article in SPhA  (); see the summary above .The com- parison of two huge corpora of texts such as those of Philo and Origen presents considerable methodological challenges. Van denHoek advocates being as thor- ough as possible, i.e. building up a complete dossier of links between them. She bases her material primarily on identifications given in editions of Philo’s and Origen’s works. These are then graded in categories from A to D, depending on the kind of influence or dependence shown in them. A dozen examples are treated inmore detail in order to show how the classification works. On the basis of the results (only summarily indicated in the article) a number of conclusions are reached. The most interesting texts are those graded A or B, which indicate certain or highly likely borrowings. It appears that Origen drew on  of Philo’s  preserved works. The subject matter is predominantly biblical interpretation and allegories, but there are also quite a few texts dealing with philosophical questions and the theme of creation. Philo was for Origen not only a theoretical model, but also a limitless resource for practical purposes. (DTR) 20254. P. W. van der Horst, ‘The First Pogrom: Alexandria CE,’ European Review  () –. The first ever documented pogrom took place in Alexandria in  c.e. The eye-witness account given by Philo is a problematic source because his concern is largely theological and also because he fails to inform the reader about the causes of the violence. These causes must be sought in a growing tendency among Alexandrian intellectuals to depict Jews as criminal misanthropes, and the Jewish tendency to side with the Roman occupiers of Egypt.

Studien zur Rezeption eines hellenistischen Ehrentitels im Neuen Testament, Neutestamentliche Abhandlungen  (Münster ), esp. –. </page> <page sequence="192">  part two The NT term Σωτ ρ (saviour, deliverer) has long been seen as the coun- terpart of pagan gods or of persons such as Hellenistic or Roman emperors who were honoured as gods. Consistent with this interpretation, NT scholar- ship has presented Jesus as the saviour in opposition to all the other preten- sions. But the present Munich dissertation under the supervision of J. Gnilka shows that it is a widely used term relating to saving actions on the part of both gods and human beings. The thesis of this Monograph is that the idea was not developed in contrast to one or many concepts of salvation but through the reception of well-known religious, cultural and political traditions, of which Philo is a good example. In the chapter about the Septuagint Jung offers a detailed description and analysis of the term in the different texts and Gattun- gen of the books which show deep Hellenistic influence. God’s activity for his chosen people becomes more and more a trait of his personality. Philo could build upon these descriptions. He focuses all his testimonies on the God of Israel as the one true Saviour. But Jung also marks the differences. First of all it is noted that the Saviour can also change to becoming Judge. This sup- ports the paraenetical approach of the author. It is interesting that all the ref- erences to God as saviour come from the Pentateuch. Jung notes the difference between the Gattungen in Philo’s treatises. But he does not notice that all the texts which underline God’s activity in preserving the world originate in the Exposition of the Law. In contrast the Allegorical Commentary uses the term σωτ ρ for God’s beneficent activity only once (Sobr. ). Deliverance can only be offered by the true creator, the God of Israel, whom all people are invited to worship. This motif is most clearly seen in the apologetic treatises (such as Legat.). In the various texts or inscriptions (and some coins) which he cites (in both Greek and German) Jung develops his method and ability of differ- entiation most impressively. The NT authors refer to these common ideas and are able to develop their own Christological concepts against this background. (GS) 20256. A. Kamesar, ‘Writing Commentaries on the Works of Philo: Some Reflections,’ Adamantius  () –. In response to the plans for the new series of commentaries on the works of Philo, the author offers suggestions for how these commentaries should approach their task. Because he himself is preparing a commentary on Det., he focuses particularly commentaries on the Allegorical Commentary. He argues that progress may be achieved by a greater focus on what he calls the ‘lower elements’ of the text.Thefirst of these is Philo’s understanding of the Septuagintal text that forms the basis of the treatises. The Septuagint should be seen as a ‘stand-alone’ text, not just a translation of the Hebrew. Moreover Philo’s reading of the text is not always easy to discern, because he often moves straight to allegorical interpretation. The second ‘lower element’ is the ‘grammatical’ level, using the term in the ancient sense, i.e. the level of interpretation or exegesis of literary texts. The third is the rhetorical level, which is the aspect of the text directed towards the reader’s edification. Kamesar ends the article by emphasizing that other themes, including the relation to wider exegetical </page> <page sequence="193"> critical studies   traditions and philosophical issues, should not be neglected. But choices have to be made, and it is hoped that differing approaches will result in a broader illumination of Philo’s writings. (DTR) 20257. P. Kotzia-Panteli, ‘Forschungsreisen.

The author mentions four texts that he believes represent the earliest Jewish writings in Hebrew about scientific knowledge; he dates these to the th or th century. One text is Sefer yetsirah (SY), which discusses components of the universe and their relationship to numbers and letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The second part of the article is a critique of Y. Liebes’Ars Poetica in Sefer Yetsirah (see above )—specifically, of Liebes’ use of parallels to date SY to the st century. Langermann primarily objects that Liebes ignores important questions about his sources and juxtaposes parallels without explaining how he chooses them and why they are significant. Liebes adduces so many parallels between SY and Philo that he devotes a separate index to Philo’s works alone. According to Langermann, these works may have been known to later Jewish writers and thus parallels with Philo would not necessarily support a first-century dating for SY.Citing an article by B.

Following a brief survey of the importance of Abraham in the varied forms and expressions of Judaism during the Second Temple period, Mach turns to the centrality of the figure in the writings of Philo. The point of departure for the investigation is the divergence of Philo’s portrayal from that found in the epistles of Paul.The latter’s focused treatment of Abraham’s ‘justification through faith’ (Gen :) is contrasted with Philo’s dynamic description of the patriarch’s progress through the acquisition of secure knowledge of the Deity.

Philo accepts a mythological reading of the biblical text. By means of allegory, he denies any sexual interpretation and affirms the radical distinction between angels and women, that is to say, between soul and material bodies. In this context we find early the term πνευματικ ς in the sense of ‘immaterial’ (QG ., Greek fragment). (JPM) 20262. J. P.

Communication begins with the creative act of the divine Logos, and extends to the unfolding of λ γ ι in nature and to the text written by Moses, the Tρμηνεupsilonacuteς. The hermeneutical act continues in the trans- lation of the LXX for all the nations, and finally, it finishes in the comprehensive reading by the wise person, who culminates the process of Tρμηνεupsilonacuteειν by silence before God.

The characteristic of ‘boundary-dweller’ (με  ρι ς) which Philo attributes to human beings in a certain measure constitutes their essence, inasmuch as the human being ()ν ρωπ ς) is presented as the being which stands in between the material world and the heavenly realm.This fact according to some scholars (H. A. Wolfson, A. Maddalena, T. H. Tobin, D. Winston, M. Harl, G. Reale and others) implies an aspect of negativity implicit from the beginning, even if it is possible to surmount the dichotomy in a third dimension of the Spirit (πνεupsilontildeμα). This third constituent bestows on the corporeal a certain positive element of participation, thanks to the (Platonic) relation between themodel and the image. In this perspective the human being comes to be identified with the noetic and rational essence. This is indivisible and immanent in anthropological reality. (RR) 20266. D. A.

The categories of Greek philosophy are here used as a tool or instrument in setting forth his views.

In this comparative study of the function of allegory in the works of Philo and Clement, the author finds that both believed that the Scriptures contained truths that might be decoded by help of allegorization. Philo’s allegorization pointed upward (beyond sense experience) and downward. The allegorization of Clement exhibited neither of these: his allegorization was flat and immediate. Clement, however, could use typology, a procedure Philo did not employ. (TS) </page> <page sequence="197"> critical studies   20270. L. Padovese, Cercatori di Dio.

In his wide-ranging account of the religious life in the first centuries of our era, with an emphasis on the themes of the search for God and the role of asceticism, the author devotes a chapter to Jewish asceticism, which he subtitles ‘marginal parenthesis in the history of Israel’. After a brief section on rabbinic/talmudic objections to asceticism, Padovese goes back in time and devotes sections to the Essenes and theTherapeutae, for whom Philo is his chief or sole source. The final ten pages of the chapter are devoted to Philo himself. After some introductory remarks, the author concentrates on the themes of the quest for God and spiritual virginity. In the case of the former theme, he notes the emphasis on human nothingness, which is contrasted with the Greek and Platonic emphasis on human perfection and self-realization. Philo thus leaves the framework of Greek asceticism and anticipates the affirmation of asceticism in Christian monasticism. (DTR) 20271. R.

The reviewer discusses Collins’ detailed argumentation for her thesis (rehabilitating the historicity of Aristeas’ account) that the origin of the LXX was a Greek initiative (Ptolemy) which met with resistance on the part of Judaism, and she expresses her surprise that Collins feels the need to exclude the possibility of more than one contributing factor at the origin of the LXX, i.e. both a Greek initiative and an interest from the part of Hellenistic Judaism to have the Scriptures in a more accessible tongue. For Passoni Dell’Acqua, the way in which Collins interprets Philo’s and Josephus’ accounts of the origin of the LXX—in her view Philo stresses the role of the Jews in the enterprise, and in so doing completely distorts Aristeas’ account, while Josephus avoids as much as possible any allusion to divine inspiration of the translation, and in so doing eliminates any support for the thesis of a Jewish initiative—ismuch influenced by the thesis which is her point of departure, and therefore runs the risk of creating a vicious circle of argumentation.

Seneca could have been present at the lectures held by Philo at Rome during his participation in the Embassy in – c.e. Moreover certain statements in Seneca’s Ep. —which constitute somewhat of an exception in his thought— look very much like a reference to the doctrine of the ideas as thoughts of God as we find it in Opif. It is in fact possible to recognize in this letter a valuable link which is lacking in the history of Platonism as it develops from the Academy to Middle Platonism. It is also a witness in favour of the thesis of the ‘bi-directionality’ of the relations between Alexandrian Judaism and Greek philosophy, i.e. the need to consider the contributions that the Jewish- Alexandrian tradition may have made to Greek philosophy and not only those contributions that move in an inverse direction.

The aim of the article is to explore which psychological model Philo uses in his analysis of rational behaviour and the passions. The author argues that the two strands of philosophical influence which he undergoes are balanced because they have been subsumed under his larger purpose. In the first part she outlines the trajectory of thought from Plato to Philo, emphasizing the role of the ‘Socratic’ view of the relation between body and soul, which is prominent in both Plato and the Stoics. Adding to the complexity of Philo’s stance is the pressure of interpreting scripture, which in large part determines his strategies. In the second part a valuable list of Philonic passages is presented under five headings: the soul/body distinction, mind versus the senses and the passions, the Stoic model of the soul, the Platonist model of the soul, and ‘mixed’ cases. On the basis of these passages a conceptual analysis of Philo’s stance is given in the final part of the article. Reydams-Schils argues that Philo’s choice for one psychological model over the other is largely determined by the context of the scriptural passage being commented on, but this is by no means sheer randomness. The distinctions between body and soul and between mind and </page> <page sequence="199"> critical studies   passions provide the higher hermeneutical ground from which he can launch either into the Platonic or the Stoic model. In both cases the Socratic paradigm plays an important role.

As an adherent of strict monotheism, Philo criticizes atheism as it manifests itself in diverse guises: polytheism (animal cult, veneration of natural elements, divinization of human beings); atheism as doctrine; atheism as moral category, symbolized by Pharaoh, but also by Cain; atheistic exegesis. In the author’s view the problematics of atheism centre on the unicity of God the uncreated cre- ator. Polytheistic cults, philosophical doctrines, wicked behaviour, inappropriate readings: all of these are judged in accordance with the single criterion of con- formity to Jewish monotheism. Everything that threatens this belief is imbued with atheism, a term which sums up everything which Philo fights against. One atheist, however, does find favour in his sight:Theodore of Cyrene, whomhe sees not so much as a denier of God but of the Athenian gods (Prob. –). (JR) 20277. D.

Chapter four of this study contains a summary of the discussion on the question of Justin’s dependence on Philo. E. R. Goodenough argues that several Philonic interpretations in Justin prove the Christian author’s dependence on Philo. A different view is advanced by L. W.

In his view the similarities between the two writers must be regarded as a product of their common source, viz. the LXX. Finally, the opinion of O. Skarskaune is reported, who posits that no evidence for a direct link between Philo and Justin exists. Justin’s sources are () Christian testimonies, based on disputes between Jewish-Christians and Christians, and () typological interpretations developed by Justin himself. (ACG) 20278. R.

For Philo the Israel which belongs to the Lord (Κupsilonacuteρι ς) are those who see and worship God. There is no difference between the Most High (LΥψιστ ς) and the Lord, and elsewhere (Opif. , Leg. ., Decal. – ) Philo affirms that there is no other God than the Most High, because God is One. Polytheism is thus rejected. However, in the Philonic texts things are not that simple. Philo records the distinction between  ε ς and κupsilonacuteρι ς and the appearance of God as three (Abr. –). He also speaks of a seven- fold appearance of the single God (QE .–). According to the author Philo has joined together Old Testament and Jewish conceptions with Greek and philosophical ideas. Despite his confession of monotheism, Philo takes up again the ancient Israelite conception of the Pantheon by paying attention to the plurality in the single God. (JR) 20279. D.

The article examines the relation between Greek philosophical and Helle- nistic-Jewish ideas by focusing on the concept of εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α, usually but mis- leadingly translated ‘happiness’. In the first section six crucial features of the con- cept in Greek thought are outlined, notably the link to the good life and theo- logical connotations. In the next two sections use of the term and concept in Philo and Josephus is examined. It is concluded that in these authors a form of eudaimonism is present, but elsewhere in Hellenistic-Jewish literature it scarcely occurs. The question is then raised whether this is perhaps merely a matter </page> <page sequence="201"> critical studies   of terminology, i.e. a Greek term is used but its content is Jewish. It is proven that this is not the case by noting that Philo relates the concept of εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α to God, which does not take place in the Bible at all. In the final section the question is raised why Philo is so attracted to the themes of excellence ( ρετ ) and well-being (εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α). It is concluded that they help him bridge the gap between his loyalty to Judaism and his situation as an intellectual in Alexandria. (DTR) 20282. D. T. Runia, ‘One of Us or One ofThem?

The starting-point for the article is the discovery of three significant Philonic papyri in Egypt, the Coptos codex, the Oxyrhynchus codex and a small papyrus fragment published in . All three are definitely of Christian provenance. The paper falls into four parts. In the first part a brief account is given of Philo’s survival in Egypt (including Alexandria). Thereafter the article concentrates on two test cases, the use of Philo by Didymus the Blind and Isidore of Pelusium. On this basis some conclusions are reached in the final section. Philo’s greatest value to Christians in Egypt was the contribution he could make to biblical interpretation.Up to the th century there was no reason to emphasize that Philo was a Jew.Hewas ‘one of us’. During the th century this tacit acceptance starts to change and it may be concluded that he begins to become ‘one of them’, albeit as a special case. With regard to the papyri, however, it is quite possible that their owners simply regarded their author as a Christian interpreter, i.e. ‘one of us’. (DTR) 20283. D. T.

Frede (edd.), Traditions ofTheology: Studies in HellenisticTheology, Its Background and Aftermath, Philosophia Anti- qua  (Leiden ) –. The article is the final one in a collection of nine papers presented at the th Symposium Hellenisticum held in Lille in the summer of . Its basic thesis is that Philo’s theology is a witness to the end of Hellenistic theology and the beginning of a new theology that would dominate philosophy until the end of antiquity. It begins with two texts in the doxographer Aëtius and the sceptic Sextus Empiricus which, it is argued, are typical of Hellenistic theology. They are confident and direct in their approach to the question of the divine nature. It either exists or it does not exist.The evidence of Philo is then called in.The paper concentrates on texts from the Exposition of the Law, esp.Opif. –, Spec. .–  and Praem. –. Through an analysis of six theological themes—the basic division of reality, the noetic cosmos and the extended image in Opif. –, the Logos, the reception of the divine powers, existence and essence, a superior path to knowledge—it is argued that the confident and direct epistemology of </page> <page sequence="202">  part two Hellenistic theology gives way to a different approach which is less confident and more complex, involving a negative theology in which the nature of God is not denied but regarded as not directly accessible to human knowledge. Three further authors are adduced by way of comparison: the Ps.Aristotelian De mundo, Seneca and Alcinous. The paper ends with some reflections on whether Philo, in his philosophical theology, is a witness or an innovator. ‘Philo stands at the interface of Hellenistic and later Greek philosophy, looking . . . both back and forward. He has the status of an outsider. The inspiration that he found in biblical thought made him sensitive to changes that were in the air, e.g. in the case of negative theology . . . [T]he texts in which Philo points forward to later developments are the ones that are most interesting.’ (p. ) (DTR) 20284. M.

Philo takes a stand against astral determinism, emphasizing the free will and responsibility of human beings. In the extensive Philonic corpus, however, the opposition against astrology is not clear. Salcedo Parrondo con- cludes that the thought of Philo rather seems a compromise between the Jewish monotheism and its Hellenistic culture, virtually an eclectic Platonism. (JPM) 20285. K. O. Sandnes, Belly and Body in the Pauline Epistles, Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series  (Cambridge ), esp. –. In a number of passages, Paul uses expressions like ‘their god is the belly’ (Phil :), or serving ‘their own belly’ (Rom :). In this study K. O. Sandnes suggests that Paul here exploits a traditional idiom, a topos or a literary com- monplace that is attested in ancient Greco-Roman sources, and exploited in Jewish sources as well. The belly became a catchword for a life controlled by the passions. Accusations of belly-worship was not only pejorative rhetoric to Paul, but developed from his conviction that the body was destined to a future with Christ. After an introductory chapter, Sandnes deals in Chapter Two with ‘Aspects of ancient theories of the belly’: ‘the belly as a sign—ancient phys- iognomics’ (pp. –); ‘The belly in ancient moral philosophy’ (pp. –); ‘Ancient critique of Epicureanism’ (pp. –), and ‘Banquets—opportunities for the belly’ (pp. –). InChapterThree he deals with ‘The appropriated belly’ (pp. –), briefly presenting aspects of the belly-topos in Jewish-Hellenistic sources, and then ‘The belly in Philo’s writings’ (pp. –). Sandnes finds two partly conflicting views on the belly in the writings of Philo. On the one hand, his warnings against being enslaved to the belly and its pleasures indicate oppo- sition to immoderate pleasure. The desires of the belly have to be controlled, </page> <page sequence="203"> critical studies   mastered or tamed. On the other hand, the belly is viewed from another per- spective as well. It is not only a matter of taking control of the belly, but of aban- doning it altogether. At the end, belly-devotion is a sign of paganism. According to Sandnes, a possible way to reconcile these two views might be Philo’s concept of gradual progress through training. Philo does not expect everyone to have reached the same level in mastering the belly, thus allowing for some flexibil- ity in his attitudes. In the rest of his study, Sandnes deals with belly-worship in the Pauline texts of Philippians, Romans and Corinthians. Finally he tests his results by having a look at how the earliest expositors of Paul’s letters dealt with this topic. (TS) 20286. P.

The notion of a feminine manifestation of God is found in the earliest kabbalistic work, the th century book Bahir. Schäfer seeks the origins of this notion by tracing possible precedents in biblical and early Jewish wisdom literature, Philo and gnostic sources, and in the idea of the Shekhinah in rabbinic literature and Jewish philosophical writings. Observing that ‘the kabbalistic notion of God’s femininity [is] a radical departure from earlier Jewish models’ (p. ), Schäfer reexamines G. Scholem’s theory that the notion originated in gnostic sources. He then turns to the Christian side of the Bahir’s setting in th century France and finds significance in ‘the gradual deification of Mary’ (p. ) and in Jewish-Christian polemics about Mary. He concludes by suggesting ways of understanding origins and influence as a dynamic process. On the subject of Philo he notes that, influenced by Jewish and philosophical traditions, Philo presents a range of complex ideas about Wisdom and the Logos, at times even changing the gender of Wisdom from female to male.

It is a curious part of the reception of Philo that he was adopted by Christian- ity as witness of the sufferings of Christ and the beginning of Christianity and that by the end of the Patristic period he had virtually achieved the status of a Church Father. This development is clearly demonstrated through two bronze busts in the Cathedral of Münster, Germany, where Philo is twice represented as part of altogether  busts of the OT prophets. He holds a scroll written with a Latin text in his hand: Philo.Morte turpissima condemnemus illum (Philo. Let us condemn him to a shameful death). This shows that he is regarded as the author of the book of Wisdom (cf. Wis :). The article pursues Philo’s Nachleben in Christianity as Prophet, witness to the beginning of Christianity and even finally by the end of the th century c.e. as bishop ('π σκ π ς).

The author shows how the modern scholarly construct of  ε( ς  ν ρ has little to do with ancient perceptions and that to first-century eyes there was no set type or model of  ε( ς  ν ρ. Scott’s eventual concern seems to be to explore how Jesus of Nazareth came to be seen as God in the Church. He identifies two features that divinized humans had in common, divine parentage and bodily ascension, but since both traits are absent from Philo’s portraiture of Moses, Scott concludes, as did Holladay before him, that we cannot look to Philo for a bridge between Hellenism and early Christian thought.

The zeal of the young Saul has been dealt with in several studies, drawing on the issue of zealotry in Palestine, but the conclusions reached are rather diverse. The present study suggests that the often overlooked phenomenon of zealotry in the writings of Philo of Alexandria should also be considered. The </page> <page sequence="205"> critical studies   material from Philo does not support the view that the early zealots formed any consistent movement or party, but that they were vigilant individuals who took the Law in their own hands when observing cases of gross transgressions of the Torah. (TS) 20291. F. Shaw, The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of Ιαω (diss. University of Cincinnati ). The publication of a fragmentary Septuagint manuscript from the Judean desert, QLXXLevb (= Q), which contains a few instances of the earliest Greek form of the Jewish name of God !Ια&lt;, has brought up the problem of the role of this name in the LXX’s textual tradition. After reviewing what little has been said in scholarship on this matter, in order to investigate the issue of this form of the divine name within Judaism, the study examines all (or nearly all) the earliest non-mystical usage of Iao. This includes the following: () Christian copies of ancient onomastica (which must go back to earlier Jewish originals) where a surprising number of instances of Iao are found in expositions of bibli- cal characters’ names. This evidence indicates that far more copies of LXX mss. containing Iao must have circulated than the single instance found so far since the onomastica were originally based on the LXX’s text. () Several classical/ Gentile sources: specifically Diodorus of Sicily and the Roman polymath Varro; other instances may exist in Herennius Philo of Byblos, the emperor Gaius (in Philo Judaeus), Valerius Maximus, and the pagan story of Jewish ass worship. () Jewish sources: a passage in the Mishnah, several instances in the Pseude- pigrapha, epigraphic evidence. () Ecclesiastical testimony: Origen, Eusebius, Jerome, Theodoret, and the unknown ecclesiastical interpolator(s) responsible for certain entries in Hesychius’ lexicon. The conclusion reached is that, if one is to understand the appearance of Iao in the LXX’s history, one must look beyond merely the textual issue. Rather this Qumran ms. is evidence of the fact that there was contention within ancient Judaism on the matter of the use and dis- use of God’s name. Not all Jews of the second temple period were eager to dis- continue their employment of the divine name. Some likely motives for their persistent use of Iao and the historical situation that may have influenced their usage of the name are explored. A chronology of the use of the divine name in various sources during the late centuries b.c.e. and the first few centuries c.e. is sketched, and an attempt is made to document when the name most likely moved from being a non-mystical usage to the more commonly known one associated with Gnostics, magical papyri, and other charms and amulets. Three areas need further investigation and elaboration. First, not all second temple period Greek-speaking Jews referred to God as κupsilonacuteρι ς or  ε ς. Some employed Iao (onomastica, Qumran ms., classical sources), some ‘Heaven’ (, Maccabees, Matthew, Prodigal Son parable in Luke), others ‘Father’ (most NT writers), others ‘the Unseen One’ (onomastica, Hebrews ), others Greek philo- sophical terms (Philo, Acts , Josephus) while at times some Jews used δεσπ - της instead of the more standard κupsilonacuteρι ς (two LXX translators, Josephus); all this, combined with scribal practices at Qumran, seems to show that there was considerable choice among ancient Jews and early Christians regarding how </page> <page sequence="206">  part two to refer to God. No one appears to have yet studied these individual preferences, and the likely reasons for them, in detail. Secondly, it becomes apparent when one works extendedly with the two critical editions of ancient onomastica that these lists have much to offer those interested both in Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity. Thirdly, though modern academics are far too often eager to state in principle that antique Judaism was quite diverse, yet they are frequently reluctant to apply this dictum to specific practices and beliefs among ancient Jews. There exists a real gap between this now nearly universally accepted gen- eral abstraction and the utilization of the notion in areas where it can help us understand the dynamics behind individual issues.

Sicre Díaz, ‘Las tradiciones de Jacob: búsqueda y rechazo de la propia identidad,’Estudios Bíblicos  () –, esp. –. Although Philo’s treatise dedicated to patriarch Jacob is lost, the author attempts to reconstruct it in outline by means of evidence in extant works. The author distinguishes and opposes two traditions of ancient Jewish literature on Jacob: one rejects him as a cheater because he has supplanted his brother; the other elevates him as model of the Jewish people. Philo belongs to this second tradition, together with Jubilees, the Targum Neofiti and others. Philo sees in Jacob a prototype of the wise person, model of asceticism and virtue. (JPM) 20293. J. Martin Soskice, ‘Philo and Negative Theology,’ Archivio di Filosofia  () –. The author argues that Philo’s treatment of the divine names cannot be accused of wrenching God from the Sinai and forcing Him into the Acropolis. In Philo (and the Christian writers who followed him) naming and knowing God presents itself as a problem because of the testimony, not of philosophy, but of Jewish scripture (p. ): above all the texts about Moses meeting God and asking his name in Exod ,  and . After a discussion of Philo’s (exegetical) thought on the subject, notably in Mut., the author concludes (p. ) that for Philo, resolutely metaphysical as his treatment is, God nevertheless is not an object of ‘adequation’: we name Him ‘by grace’ and ‘relatively’.

Festschrift für W. Huber zum . Geburtstag (Gütersloh ) –. In this article Theissen makes an interesting comparison between Paul and Philo and gives some noteworthy parallels. He claims to find a synthesis between the Hellenistic autonomous ethic (with freedom from all passions) and the bib- lical love which human beings are commanded to exercise towards their fel- lows. Paul and Philo both focus on exemplary communities. The author main- tains that this synthesis is systematically set out in Philo’s treatise on Freedom (Prob.). He focuses on three levels of freedom: freedom as self-determination which is well-founded in God; freedom as competence in law; freedom as competence in conflicts. But both authors have their own particular insights too. It is Philo’s firm conviction that a society is able to abandon slavery. He idealizes Jewish community life and the social-cultural expression of the way of life of the Therapeutae or Essenes. In his view a life in obedience to the law is possible for all people. Paul introduces in Galatians the term freedom as a counter-term to social and religious pressure (Gal :; cf. :,  f.). For Paul freedom could and sometimes must mean resistance to the (Jewish) law. (GS) 20296. A. Tripolitis, Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age (Grand Rapids ), esp. –. Besides an introduction and conclusion, the book is divided into five parts. Part I, ‘The Hellenistic-Roman World’, surveys historical background, mystery cults, and religious philosophies. Part II covers Mithraism; Part III, Hellenistic Judaism; Part IV, Christianity; part V, Gnosticism. In her treatment of Hellenis- tic Judaism, the author considers the history and Hellenization of the Jewish Diaspora and addresses the development of the synagogue. She also devotes a section to Philo (pp. –), whom she singles out as the most important repre- sentative of this kind of Judaism. After briefly describing Aristobulus as the first to interpret the Pentateuch allegorically, Tripolitis discusses Philo’s ideas about God, the Logos, the universe, the human soul, and the individual’s quest for God. She notes that although Philo was an observant, committed Jew, he was ‘rejected by Palestinian Jewish theologians’ (p. ); instead his thought influenced later pagan philosophers and Christian thinkers.

With some  photographs and sketches, this impressive volume details the results of these excavations and explains the distinctiveness of the monumental tombs—which combine Greek and Egyptian elements—from the Ptolemaic through to the Roman period. The author also discusses the influence of the Alexandrian style in tombs outside the city, whether in Egypt or beyond. Very few Jewish tombs can be identified with certainty. Features that suggest a Jewish identification include lamps showing a seven-branched candelabrυμ or a palm tree, epitaphs with biblical or Jewish names like Miriam or Joseph, and the absence of ornaments and paintings. Jews were buried in all parts of the city in the same cemeteries as other groups. Philo is mentioned only in passing for evidence that Jews lived throughout the city (p. ).Nonetheless Philo scholarsmaywish to consult this volume to learnmore about the great cosmopolis—home to the most important Jewish Diaspora of its time—where Philo lived and wrote.

This study is the author’s  Tübingen dissertation with some supplements, especially for the Qumran writings. Even if Philo’s interest concerns mainly the Pentateuch and Moses as the most important inspired person, he knows much more about OT writings. Some texts like Sam were cited as a *ερ4ς λ γ ς. When telling the story of the Septuagint translationmiraculous aspects are given much more emphasis when compared to the narrative of the so-called Letter of Aristeas. Many terms of the Platonic doctrine of inspiration occur. Philo shows that he knows all four kinds of inspiration of the Greek tradition. He himself is presented as an inspired author.Nevertheless the biblical texts are his first source. The use of the term πνεupsilontildeμα comes nearer to the Jewish tradition than to the Greek background. Whitlock explains some traditional views on the question of inspiration and the Holy Scripture. Most of these he agrees with, but on some occasions he has reexamined the texts for his own purpose. In some cases, however, he is criticizing interpretations such as that of H. Leisegang which goes back to the beginning of the th century. Interactionwith recent interpretations of Philo is rare.

Winston commences his beautifully crafted paper with some general remarks on his understanding of the main thrust of Philo’s thought. In his commentaries the reader is ‘deftly beguiled into discovering Greek philosophical doctrine beneath the literal shell of the scriptural narrative’ (p. ).The aim of the paper is to examine several themes in Philo’s thought that resist an easy blending of their Jewish and Greek elements. In each case Winston prefaces his treatment with a brief description of the theme in the Wisdom of Solomon, whose author was probably Philo’s near contemporary. The first theme is creation. Various texts are cited in order to establish and confirm that Philo espouses the doctrine of eternal creation, i.e. God is always creating the universe in a process that had no beginning. The largest part of the article treats the theme of revelation, particularly in relation to the role of Moses as author of scripture and Philo’s theory of three types of prophecy. Winston restates his position and compares it with other interpretations by Burkhardt, Levison and Amir. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the theme of providence. The cyclical ‘dance’ of the Logos (Deus ) can be reconciled with Philo’s belief in the eventual advent of the Messianic age if it is assumed that the rotation equality of the present cosmic era will be replaced by a steady state form of equality, in which there will be no dislocations of the divine economy.

The concept of  π ρρ ια (emanation) enjoyed a wide distribution in the first century of the Imperial era, especially in eschatological and astrological texts. It generally indicates the emanation or effusion of the divine substance, while sometimes the human soul is regarded as a direct effect of such emanation. Among the authors who apply the term in this sense is Philo, who inMigr. – and Congr.  undertakes an interpretation of logos as speech, the emanation of thought, and thought as the origin of emanation.

The article applies to Philo’s works the concepts of utopia and uchronia (i.e. not locating a story in a particular time).The positive aspects of Judaism are not located in their historical setting, e.g. the period of biblical monarchies. Instead the ideal Jewish communities are represented by two groups which worship God: the Essenes (Prob. –) and the Therapeutae (Contempl.). In order to develop these concepts, Philo established anuchronia based on the philosophical tradition of Hellenism. (JPM) 20303. M. Alesso, ‘No es bueno que el hombre esté solo,’ Circe  () –. Explaining the term ‘alone’ of Gen : at the beginning of Leg. , Philo con- firms that monotheism is the theological axis of his thought. His interpreta- tion does not respond completely to the ‘creationistic’ pattern of Plato’s Timaeus, because the One—unchanging and eternal—only becomes related to the mate- rial order through the Logos, the creative agent conceived as the mediator Word. The human intellect is related to the body like the divine Logos to the cosmos. The nous needs the mediation of powers (δυν μεις) which, activated, connect it with the world through the senses.

Judaism is not a uniform block; different groups have different interests. He shows that exchange of religious ideas occurs not only in the intellectual upper class of Alexandria. On the other hand it is argued that, in contrast to the situation in Asia Minor, the political background fosters the outbreak of the riots. The social order had been disturbed from the beginning of the Roman era, allowing the ‘market-place’ to become a theatre of war. (GS) 20305. H.

In their preface, the authors identify several approaches to the relationship between science and religion: denying the divine, denying science, understand- ing the divine as compatible with science, viewing science and religion as com- pletely distinct spheres, and declaring the ways of God to be unknowable. Part One has chapters on the problem posed by science and religion, the nature of human reason, ancient and modern science, the origin of scientific attempts to explain the world, and pagan philosophers’ attempts to reconcile science and religion through their understanding of God. Part Two is devoted to attempts from antiquity (Plato) through the end of the th century to reconcile sci- ence and religion. In this section Philo earns a chapter of his own. With Opif. as their focus, the authors explain that Philo grounds ethics in physics when he claims that Mosaic Law derives from the creator of the whole universe, and he thus views Jewish law as having universal significance. The authors discuss how Philo interprets the biblical creation account in terms of Plato’s Timaeus, and they observe that his notion of God goes beyond the realm of Platonic ideas. Philo’s efforts ‘to reconcile the best scientific theories of his era with revealed religion’ were continued in the Middle Ages by Jewish, Chris- tian, and Islamic philosophers who grappled with Aristotelian science (p. ).

The story of Abraham’s hospitality to the three visitors in Gen :– was retold and interpreted by later exegetes to reflect their own interests, values, and </page> <page sequence="212">  part two customs. The author examines how traditions connected with this passage developed in such Hellenistic Jewish sources as the Septuagint, Jubilees, Philo, Josephus, and the Testament of Abraham; Christian sources such as Clement, Apocalypse of Paul, Origen, John Chrysostum, and Augustine; and rabbinic sources such asThe Fathers according to R. Nathan, Genesis Rabbah, and Sotah (Babylonian Talmud). Most of these writings view Abraham as a paradigm of hospitality to be imitated. Common concerns in some works include identifying the three visitors as men, angels, or God; addressing how the visitors could be described as eating, since it was commonly assumed that angels do not eat; and viewing Isaac’s birth as a reward for Abraham’s hospitality. Philo saw Abraham as a living law, whose example of hospitality was to be emulated. Philo also contrasted Abraham’s hospitality with the inhospitality of the Egyptians rather than that of the Sodomites, which the Bible and other interpreters emphasized. It is also shown how these various traditions can illuminate passages in the New Testament, especially Heb :. (EB) 20308. D. E. Aune, T. Seland and J. H.

In order to illustrate her reading of Contempl. seen as a replica of the Platonic model of the city, she has focused on the following themes: the location of the community, its regimen of food and clothing, the presence of women in the community, and the description of the banquet.

Berthelot, Philanthropia judaica: le débat autour de la ‘misanthropie’ des lois juives dans l’ antiquité, Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism  (Leiden ). This significant study in the context of Philonic and Jewish studies con- sists of three parts. In the first part, entitled ‘The discourses of ancient authors on Jewish misanthropy,’ there is a first chapter which traces the history of the word  ιλ ν ρωπ ς and its derivatives in Greek literature. A second chapter is devoted to the history of the accusation of μισαν ρωπ α brought against the Jews in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In the second part entitled ‘Reactions and responses,’ the third chapter sets out ‘the first echoes’ which are found in the Hellenistic-Jewish literature, especially from Alexandria, in response to these accusations.Thenext chapter is particularly important because it brings together the texts in Philo of Alexandria in defence of Jewish  ιλαν-  ρωπ α. After first setting out the ‘context of the Philonic discourse,’ the author examines how the  ιλαν ρωπ α of the Law is manifested in the case of the ‘living laws,’ i.e. the Patriarchs, and presents the example of Moses as well as the universal scope of the  ιλαν ρωπ α of the Law as set out in Virt. Finally she draws attention to the apology for Judaism which is developed in Hypoth. The third part, which is chapter five, is dedicated to Josephus, who in contrast to Philo almost never described the Law as ‘humane.’ He hes- itates to use the term in relation to Judaism, but instead uses it in giving favourable descriptions of main political, military and religious figures, whether they are Jews or non-Jews. In Contra Apionem, however, he alters his general practice and speaks about the  ιλαν ρωπ α of Judaism, drawing his inspira- tion from Philo’s Hypoth. Reviews: F.

Ulrichsen (edd.),Neotestamentica et Philonica: Studies in Honor of Peder Borgen, Supplements to Novum Testamentum  (Leiden ) –. According to D. Dawson, Alexandrian Jewish writers use allegorical inter- pretation to present the best of Greek culture as originally Jewish and thus to portray the Jews as more learned than the Greeks. Testing this claim in a study of the Letter of Aristeas, the fragments of Aristobulus, and the works of Philo, the author concludes that Dawson is only partially correct. The allegor- ical and non-allegorical parts of these works reflect a variety of stances: not all allegorizations that depict the Jews as superior—especially those in Aris- teas and Philo—necessarily draw upon originally Greek meanings. Many alle- gorical interpretations—particularly those of Aristobulus and Philo—are sim- ply neutral about the Jews, while the non-allegorical parts of these works may express Jewish superiority. By contrast, Philo sometimes uses allegorical inter- pretations to imply equality between Jews and all wise and virtuous peoples, regardless of ancestry. Such equality is suggested as well in non-allegorical parts of both Aristeas and Philo. Birnbaum also considers whether allegorical inter- pretations in Aristeas and Philo may reflect contemporary Alexandrian soci- ety, and she focuses onMos. .– and Congr.  as specific Philonic exam- ples. While often suggestive, such correlations between exegesis and social real- ity must remain speculative. (EB) 20313. L. Boff and J.-Y. Leloup, I terapeuti del deserto.

This article argues for the desideratum of ‘a comprehensive study of eth- nic stereotypes in the ancient world’ (p. ); the lack of such research has fos- tered errant views and judgments of ancient ‘anti-Semitism’ due to insufficient contextualization within the range of Greek and Roman attitudes toward bar- barian nations in general. The bulk of the discussion is devoted to a survey of a complex of Greco-Roman attitudes toward Egyptian culture and worship. Though there are few direct references to Philo’s writings (pp. , , ), the issue discussed is of immediate import to all students of Hellenistic Judaism. (DS) 20315. P.

In this study the author describes his task as to show how aspects of Philo’s writings can illuminate aspects of the Gospel of John. His main thesis is that Philo not only can throw light upon several of the exegetical methods and exegetical traditions found in John, but that he also provides comparative mate- rial to the way exegesis of the laws of Moses was a factor in controversies both within the synagogue and between the synagogue and the emerging Christian community. He argues this thesis by drawing on several of his former studies, highlighting in this particular essay especially issues such as the use of Scrip- ture, controversies over the Sabbath, dangers at the boundary, birth from above, the Temple, and ascent and descent.

The chapter by Borgen in this volume on Biblical Interpretation is a con- densed presentation of Philo as an exegete. The author presents the various aspects of Philo’s exegesis under the following main headings: Philo’s exposi- tory writings, Hermeneutical presuppositions, Aspects of Philo’s exegesis, Philo as an exegete in context, Some exegetical approaches and forms, and The Laws of Moses in the Alexandrian conflict. Each of these sections is divided into subsections providing characterizations and examples of the various exegeti- cal procedures to be found in the works of Philo. He is on the one hand to be seen against the background of tendencies present in earlier literature pre- served from Alexandrian Judaism; on the other hand, he in turn also influ- enced the theologians and exegetes of the early church, especially in making the connection between the biblical sources and philosophical ideas and categories.

Philo criticizes those who consider the cosmos as ungenerated and imperishable and show more admiration for the cosmos than its maker. According to Bos Philo refers here to those philosophers who do not recognize any transcendent reality, whom he calls Chaldeans. They have a cosmic theology, whereas Philo supports a meta-cosmic theology. Bos argues that Philo is influenced by Aristotle, and especially by the Aristotelian work De Mundo, which Bos, in contrast to the opinio communis, regards as written by Aristotle himself. In the final part Bos deals with Aristotle’s the- ory about the generation of living creatures, which he, according to Bos, also applies to the cosmos as the most perfect living creature. Three issues are </page> <page sequence="216">  part two discussed: (a) the view that the Father is not the maker but only the first mover; (b) the proliferation of movement; (c) the movement in semen as the vehicle of logos.

Bosman, Conscience in Philo and Paul: a Conceptual History of the Synoida Word Group, Wissenschaflichte Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament . (Tübingen ). This impressive monograph is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Pretoria in  (see RRS ). In spite of the impression given by the title, the subject of the study is narrower than the broad concept of conscience. It studies the crucial terms related to the verb σupsilonacuteν ιδα, especially the nouns συνειδ ς and συνε δησις, the former being more common in Philo, the latter in Paul. The study falls into five main parts. In the first the interpretation of the word-group from Patristic times to modern scholarship is presented. The second part studies the lexical history of the word-group. The third part is more theoretical and attempts to reconstruct the terms’ historical meaning through use of the stimulus-response scheme. But the main part of the book is formed by the two long sections on Philo and Paul. Philo’s usage is thoroughly examined. Analysis of συνειδ ς should be separated from his use of :λεγ1 ς, because the former usually has a negative role, i.e. it rebukes and chastises, whereas the latter can be positive in bringing about reconciliation and healing. Philo connects συνειδ ς with outspokenness (παρρησ α) and places much emphasis on the role of rationality. To some degree Philo moderates the negative role of the term, because the ultimate aim is reconciliation with God. In the final part the study moves to Paul’s writings. Here συνε δησις acts as a monitor which registers the inner states of the person, i.e. loses the negative force it has in Philo and virtually becomes part of the soul. Paul places greater emphasis on the sovereignty of God’s judgement. See further . Reviews: R. Vicent, Sales  () –; F. G. Downing, JSNT  () –; D. T.

Braun Pasternak (edd.), Gender and Difference in the Middle Ages (Minneapolis ) –. Boyarin identifies two stances in ancient and modern discussions about gen- der and sex, both of which have negative implications for the female. According to one stance, sexual differences between men and women are transcended in an idealistic universal representation, which despite the transcendence of differ- ences is expressed as male. A second stance emphasizes sexual differentiation, whereby the two sexes remain distinct and are defined by their biological roles. The first stance is reflected in the observation of Jacques Lacan that the Phallus is not the penis—i.e., the universal, male signifier is different from the physical male organ. Boyarin sees an ancient expression of the two stances in the different treatments by Philo and the Rabbis of the two stories of the creation of human- ity. For Philo, the first story tells of the creation of an ideal human androgyne, referred to as male, while the second tells of the creation of a real, physical male from whom a physical female was produced. By contrast, the Rabbis see in the first story the creation of a real, physical human with both male and female gen- itals, and in the second story, the sexual separation of this human into two bod- ies. Boyarin traces the first stance in the myth of Isis, Osiris, and Typhon (which introduces the Phallic symbolism) and in Christian and philosophical writers; he also discusses various interpretations of Lacan’s ideas, and explores implica- tions of the two stances in both ancient thought and modern feminist discourse on the Phallus.

Philonic texts cited are Hypoth. .. Decal.  and Spec. . The confrontation of the Jews in Alexandria with the city’s Hellenistic milieu could explain the frequency of the subject of pederasty and must be seen as playing a role in the background. Philo’s significance lies in his framing of the question within the exegesis of the sixth commandment. In this way the prohibition of homosexuality is diverted into the paraenetic sequences of the Decalogue as understood in Hellenistic Judaism. (GS) 20322. L.

This study seeks to understand the paradox of Joseph’s anonymity in Ios. It is striking that Philo avoids naming the chief personage of his treatise as much </page> <page sequence="218">  part two as he possibly can. Instead he presents him as the type of the politician. This representation was set aside by the Church Fathers and medieval authors, who basically see in Joseph a prefiguration of Christ. From the Renaissance onwards Joseph again takes on the role of the political person, but the ambiguity which this role possessed for Philo is now lost. He becomes the type of the good politician, or indeed of the ideal prince. (JR) 20323. J.

This study, the published version of aDurham dissertation, examines the Jew- ish background to Paul’s statements that he is a ‘slave of Christ’ and other uses of slave terminology and metaphor. In a preliminary discussion of terminology, Byron notes that slavery language is extremely common in Philo (more than  instances). There seems to be a preference for the term δ upsilontildeλ ς above that of  ερ πων, but the term δι κ ν ς is quite rare. Philo uses slavery language mainly in philosophical and exegetical contexts, and not with reference to his- torical situations as in Josephus. These insights are further developed in chap- ter  entitled ‘Responses to Slavery in the Writings of Philo’. The author argues that participation in the Alexandrian Jewish diaspora community seems to have shaped Philo’s views on slavery. The Jews could accept their situation because they had the freedom to worship God. Philo recasts Judaism in philosophical terms with its most important marker: ‘his tenacious adherence to monolatry and the belief that God is sovereign over all creation’ (p. ). Both the themes of covenant and exile are largely absent in Philo’s thought, allowing him to blur the outsider/insider ideology of enslavement to God found in other Jewish writ- ers. Philo’s approach to slavery is further investigated through an analysis of his writings in two stages: (a) Prob. illustrates his views from the philosoph- ical (esp. Stoic) perspective; (b) his exegetical writings offer a more theologi- cal perspective. Slavery and freedom are most often interpreted in terms of the moral qualities of the soul. Esau is a prime example of the slave, because he is enslaved to his passions. His example shows that it can be beneficial to be physically enslaved. The last part of the discussion focuses on slavery to God. According to Philo God has sovereign control over creation and humanity’s response should be one of obedience and loyalty, coupled with the rejection of self-rule. This is typified by the reponse of Abraham, whom the visitors (Gen ) call a ‘fellow slave’ of God (Abr. ). Philo’s view is perhaps best summa- rized by his statement that ‘of all things slavery to God is best’ (Somn. .). (DTR) 20324. A. Cacciari, ‘Philo and the Nazirite,’ in F.

Important issues in Philo’s presentation are: () the significance of the person of the Nazirite, whom Philo never calls by the calque from the Hebrew; () the comparison with the (High) priest: both abstain from wine and strong drink; () the notion of defilement within the contrast between ‘purity’ and ‘impurity’; () the distinction between voluntary and involuntary sins. The main reason for involuntary failure is ignorance. Cacciari argues that Platonic and Stoic ideas play an important role in Philo’s treatment of this theme. (ACG) 20325. F. Calabi, ‘Il serpente e il cavaliere: piacere e “sophrosyne,” ’ Annali di Scienze Religiose  () –. Depending on the differing biblical contexts, Philo gives the snake two meanings. It may represent alternatively pleasure or self-control. From the ethical perspective of controlling the passions, these meanings represent two contrasting poles. If, however, the discourse is concerned with the formation of knowledge, i.e. the apprehension of the sensible realm by the intellect, then pleasure, far from representing wicked cunning which is to be tamed or even eliminated, in fact constitutes the instrument of knowledge that guarantees the union of Adam and Eve, symbols of intellect and sensation. The ambivalence which characterizes the snake is the same as that which characterizes pleasure. It can bring on death, but in other situations it is the source of knowledge and procreation, and therefore of life, and also of ethical and historical determination for the human being whowas uncertain and incapable ofmaking a choice before meeting the snake.

The aim of this collection of essays is to give English-speaking scholars an impression of research on Philo carried out by Italian scholars. As the editor notes in her introduction, there has been a significant increase in Philonic scholarship in Italy during the past – years, but it has had less impact than it might have on account of the language in which it is written. Interest in Philo is growing and his work is being studied from different points of view and from different perspectives by scholars working in different disciplines. The present study contains nine separate articles which are written with various approaches: historical, linguistic, philological and philosophical. All nine articles are cited under their authors’ names in the present bibliography. The study concludes with an index of Philonic passages and an index of modern scholars. Reviews: F.

Some of Origen’s statements about the unknowability and unattainability of God are derived from the Platonic analogy between the Good and the sun in the image of the Cave. Taking as its starting point an article by John Dillon on Origen’s use of the imagery of light in the De principiis, the paper attempts to discover whether any aspects of his reading can be traced back to Philo. The theme of the brightness of the Good which makes the objects of knowledge knowable and consequently dazzles whoever wishes to achieve the contemplation of the source of knowability is derived from the Platonist tradition which emphasizes the impossibility of obtaining knowledge of the first Principle. The interpretation of the sun analogy and the dimming of sight through the brightness of the incorporeal rays is present in Philowhen he affirms that the ‘One who is’ is unknowable. From Him, like from the sun, blinding rays of light stream forth which make vision impossible. Just as He is )ρρητ ς,  κατ ληπτ ς and  περιν ητ ς, so he is also   ρατ ς. His essence cannot be known. He can only be seen ‘from a distance’ (cf. Somn. .). But at the same time God is the creator of intelligible light which gives sensible objects their power of illumination. Unlike Plato Philo makes a distinction between the source of light and the rays that shine forth. The latter are equated with the divine Powers, but even they blind the viewer. Origen also accepts the distinction, but the rays are associated with the Son, who deprives himself of equality with the Father in order to show humankind the path of knowledge. (RR) 20328. F.

Philo has true deification inmind in his portrayal ofMoses when the problem is considered from the perspective of ancient and Philonic conceptions of gender. When Moses is mapped against the integrally related but fluid, shifting, and relative categories of gender and divinity, his perfect masculinity becomes commensurate with his divinity. Philo shares with the Roman world the idea of a divine continuum. As Moses climbs up the gender hierarchy, he simultaneously draws nearer to divinity, relative to the asexual masculinity of God (Mos. .). (KAF) 20331. N.

On the basis of texts of Philo, taken mainly from the Allegorical </page> <page sequence="222">  part two Commentary on the Law, and from previous studies by E. Bréhier and H. A. Wolfson, the author illustrates the double function of the Logos as image of God and paradigm of the cosmos. He concludes that there are three lev- els in the status of ideas according to Philo: () before creation, as infinite power of God; () as created ideas, immanent in the divine Mind, which form the intelligible world; () as emanated ideas, reflected in the sensible world.

The treatises Flacc. and Legat. are often typified as historical, but according to the author they are to be viewed as writings on political philosophy and not as works which attempt to establish some kind of ‘historical truth.’ As a participant in the events he records, Philo is too engaged a witness to be a reliable informant. Legat.  illustrates his philosophical point of view when he is confronted with the absolute power of Caligula. Philo’s personages develop in the course of his political writings (Ios., Mos.) like puppets which symbolize differing postures. They play the terrible game of sacral power, constantly mixing up their human identity with that of the gods. Flaccus is a pretender. Caligula is an imitator of the divine. In contrast, Philo’s heroes—Joseph, Moses or even Agrippa—represent unity in the face of worldly diversity; rejecting power games, they take up the mission of being intermediaries in the bosom of a universe of which God is the sole monarch. (JR) 20335. D. S. Dodson, ‘Philo’s De Somniis in the Context of Ancient Dream Theories and Classifications,’ Perspectives in Religious Studies  () –. Dodson surveys Greco-Roman dream theories and classifications and con- siders Philo’s discussion in Somn. within this context. Homer and Plato dis- tinguish between dreams that come true and those that do not, but neither writer classifies dreams more formally. Other ancient thinkers who do clas- sify dreams are Herophilus, Artemidorus, Macrobius and Posidonius. Ques- tions behind the classifications of the first three thinkers pertain to whether or not a dream is predictive, and Artemidorus and Macrobius are also inter- ested in whether a predictive dream requires interpretation or is straightfor- ward. Underlying Posidonius’ approach is the issue of how humans can, with divine help, gain knowledge of the future through their dreams. Philo shows familiarity with these contemporary ideas about dreams, and his dream classi- fication in Somn. ‘has a practical correlation with the dream theory of Artemi- dorus/Macrobius and a formal one with the dream classification of Posidonius’ (p. ).

The author is above all interested in Philo’s understanding of reality (‘Wirk- lichkeitsverständnis’). Philo is regarded as a Middle Platonic source, parallel to Plutarch, Seneca or Alcinous, especially with regard to the themes of eschatol- ogy, protology and angelology (which also covers the questions of theodicy and the problem of evil). The relevant texts are cited in full, translated into German, analyzed with due awareness of the context, and discussed. He concludes that it is only possible to speak of eschatology in Philo to a limited extent; it is better to speak of human destiny in terms of aretalogy. Protology is intended only in a religious sense, i.e. in the acknowledgement of the transcendence of God, pre- venting the error of deifying the world. Philo’s greater interest is in angelology, which connects transcendence and immanence andmediates between them (see the text Somn. .–). The angels are compared with demons or identified with God’s δυν μεις or his λ γ ι. (GS) 20337. G. Ellia, La sensation chez Philon d’Alexandrie: spiritualité des sens (DEA Université de Caen ). In the first part of the study the author presents the divisions of the soul adopted by Philo and determines the place that sense-perception occupies in the soul. He then establishes the status which the Alexandrian gives sense- perception. It is regarded as the privileged locus of spirituality and of the spiritual quest. In the second part an examination is made of the different senses. It emerges that it is the confrontation between hearing and sight which reveals the importance of sense-perception in the spiritual life. (JR) 20338. J. E.

Philo speaks disapprovingly of homosexual activities between men and boys, in which the boys may or may not participate voluntarily, and homosexual activities between men and men, in which participation may or may not be voluntary. The basis of Philo’s objection to male homosexual behavior is that it does not accord with nature because () it involves unnatural indulgence in pleasure; () its purpose is not to procreate, and procreation is the only acceptable reason for sexual relations; and () it places a male in a female role, which is not only unnatural for a man but also demeaning and debilitating.

In the present study Engberg-Pedersen argues that these transla- tions hold for Philo too. (TS) 20341. L. H. Feldman, ‘Conversion to Judaism in Classical Antiquity,’ Hebrew Union College Annual  () –. This article investigates the evidence for the considerable increase in the number of Jews between  b.c.e and the first century c.e. Dealing with the question of how many Jews there were in the Hellenistic-Roman period, Feldman uses Josephus and Philo as sources. Although we do not know the exact number of the Jews, it was very large: Philo remarks that there are a million Jews in Egypt (Flacc. ). The explanation for the increase in the number of Jews has to be found in voluntary conversion to Judaism. Judaism was not a missionary religion but the Jewswerewell disposed towards attracting converts. Philo shows a favorable attitude toward conversion of non-Jews to Judaism. He portrays, for instance, Tamar (Gen :–) as being converted from polytheism to the belief in one God (Virt. –), even though there is no biblical basis for this event. People were attracted to the Jewish faith for various reasons, and especially for the economic advantages it might bring. (ACG) 20342. L. H.

This command- ment is similar to others in the Bible that call for destruction of the Amalekites and the nations of the kings Sihon and Og. Philo does not mention any of these commandments. Instead he allegorizes Amalek as passion and a pleasure- hungry character. For Philo, the worst punishment, that of being killed, is reserved for apostates. Ps.Philo mentions in passing the commandment about the Amalekites, but without a rationale; he also omits the commandment about the seven nations and several details about the episodes related to Sihon and Og. A possible explanation is that this writer lived in the land of Israel and rec- ognized that it was necessary to get along with its non-Jewish inhabitants. In the longest section of the article, devoted to Josephus, Feldman discusses Jose- phus’ treatment of various biblical intermarriages and of the commandment to destroy Amalek and the seven nations. Josephus’ explanation that such a com- mandment was ‘necessary for the survival of the Israelites as a people, since the Canaanites would destroy the ancestral constitution’ (p. ) would have appealed to his Roman readers and displayed his loyalty before his Jewish read- ers.

The author reviews the account of the early career of Moses (Exod :–:) as represented in the Philonic corpus, and principally Mos. .–, under the following topical rubrics: () Moses’ escape from Egypt; () Moses in Midian; () the Burning Bush; () Moses’ return to Egypt. Particular attention is given to those themes central to Philo’s thought (e.g., Moses’ lack of human eloquence), as well as to those elements which are the subject of special emphasis (or conspicuous silence). Feldman argues that departures from the order of the biblical narrative, expanded treatments of certain episodes and the curtailment (or omission) of others is most often the result of apologetic sensitivities; this is demonstrated in several cases through comparison with Josephus’ account (esp. at AJ .–).

In the exegetical tradition Jethro is a controversial figure. Philo, together with the Rabbis, belongs to those whose attitude towards him is divided. The article analyzes Philo’s treatment in Mos. and elsewhere of the two main episodes in which Jethro occurs in the Bible, his treatment of Moses on arriving in Midian and his advice toMoses on improving his administration. It proves very difficult to explain the inconsistencies in Philo’s attitude to Jethro. Feldman concludes that most likely his general attitude is negative, coming particularly to the fore when he is taken as a symbol of the preference of the human above the divine and the seemingly wise above the truly wise, but that he is willing to concede that Jethro was able to give Moses good technical advice.

Philo describes the rebellion of the Levite Korah against Moses, but he does not mention Korah’s name (.–, –). In contrast to Josephus, Philo does not mention Korah’s descent, wealth or ability as speaker. His main concern is theological: Korah resists the divine commands by which Moses was appointed as leader. It is a conflict between belief and disbelief. In the biblical account Dathan and Abiram are also mentioned as leaders in the revolt, but Philo omits their names. In contrast to the biblical narrative, Philo tells us that the Levites try to persuade the tribe of Reuben to join the revolt. (ACG) 20346. L. H. Feldman, ‘Philo’s Version of Balaam,’ Henoch  () –. The fascination that the figure of Balaam exercised on Philo may be seen from the sheer amount of space that he devotes to him, both because of his interest in the phenomenon of prophecy and because he sought to elevate the figure of Moses, the true prophet, through contrasting him with Balaam, the greatest of pagan prophets but actually a mere technician (μ ντις). Philo is consistent in disparaging him, notably in his most extended treatment of the Balaam episode, Mos. .–, where he does not even mention Balaam by name. He is careful in his treatment of Balaam’s messianic-like prediction that a man will come forth from the Israelites who will rule over many nations (including the Edomites, from whom according to later tradition the Romans were descended). Philo reduces Balaam’s prophetic claims to absurdity by stating that his donkey proved to have superior sight; he omits, however, to say that the donkey spoke, presumably because sophisticated readers would find this hard to believe. Finally, Philo, perhaps indirectly referring to what he saw in the Alexandrian Jewish community of his own days, adds that it is Balaam who suggests to Balak the means by which he may overcome the Israelites, namely by illicit sexual allurements coming fromMoabite women.

The author discusses several questions relating to the interpretation of Noah and the flood by Philo, Josephus, Ps.Philo, and the rabbis. On the question of the historicity of Noah and the flood, Philo has no doubts and does not regard the story as a myth. An important theological issue in his reading is that God is perfectly just and that people suffer because they deserve it. As a philosopher Philo is also concerned with the question why animals, who do not have free will, are also destroyed by God. Philo emphasizes the fact that God lengthened the lives of those living at the time of the flood in order that they may repent. </page> <page sequence="227"> critical studies   Noah is saved because of his justice.

Philo reflects solid awareness of the technical and practical discussions of music in Greek philosophical thought represented by the Pythagoreans, Platon- ists, Aristotelians, and Stoics. His frequent statements about instrumental and vocal music demonstrate his high regard for music. It positively results in har- mony of soul and of whole person, while musical ratios and harmonies illus- trate number symbolism and cosmic harmony. The principal function of music was for praising God. Philo provides the fullest and most informative account of the musical activities of the Jews in Alexandria and among the Therapeutae. The other tradition in Greek philosophy concerning music, that of the Sophists, Sceptics, and Epicureans, is also examined as it comes to expression in Philode- mus, who attacks the philosophical tradition about music reflected in Philo.

The author first explains the process of ‘de-historicizing’ the biblical narrative, which forms the basis of the allegorical interpretation of the first human beings. When analyzed in terms of genealogy and bioi, the historical part of the Pen- tateuch is read as an archaeology of the legislative part, but conversely the laws too are an ‘archaeology,’ i.e. a discourse which transcribes the virtues embod- ied by the biblical ancestors. One of these ancestors, Enos, embodies Hope, an essential component of Jewish piety which the Greek language conceptualizes through the single term 'λπ ς. It enables Philo to give a sketch of the contours of the virtue of Hope, unknown to the Greeks, through a remodelling of the Stoic system of the passions. (JR) 20350. J.

This article explores possible historical and sociological interpretations of the unique expression συναγωγF τ upsilontilde ΣατανO, to be found in Rev : and :. There are three main historical solutions prevalent in recent research. The first is that the expression reflects a fictitious situation where the entire book was meant for internal encouragement. The second is that the expression refers to other Christians, since there are several other internal Christian conflicts reported in Revelation. The third one suggests that the expression refers to non-Christians. This is the solution that Fuglseth prefers, particularly since he finds traces of similar conflicts in Philo, which makes it more probable to see the Christian expression as part of an extra-mural conflict. The author also draws on theories about sects to understand the social issues at stake and suggests translations that avoid using words like ‘Jew’ and ‘synagogue.’ (TS) 20354. K. L. Gaca,The Making of Fornication: Eros, Ethics and Polit- ical Reform in Greek Philosophy and Early Christianity (Berkeley ), esp. –. In this impressive and wide-ranging study the author investigates the origins of the restrictive code of sexual morality in Christianity. She rejects the view that it is in part based on views developed in the Greek philosophical ethics of the Platonic tradition and the Stoa. Instead she places at the centre of her study the concept of ‘fornication’ (π ρνε α), which she takes to mean ‘sexual behavior opposed to God’s law.’ The term has a biblical background and embodies an entire way of thinking that aims to regulate sexual behaviour for purposes of religious and social control. The study is structured in three parts: the first discusses the sexual reforms advocated by Greek philosophers; the second concentrates on the watershed period of the st century c.e., analyzing first the Septuagint, and then the crucial contributions of Philo and Paul; the third moves to the Patristic period, where Philonic and Pauline ideas are taken up and further developed by Tatian, Clement and Epiphanes. Chapter seven, entitled ‘Philo’s reproductive city of God,’ focuses on Philo. The author argues that Philo wishes to establish a city of God based on a philosophical interpretation of the Law of Moses. His agenda in sexual matters is innovative in that he wishes to combine the restrictive laws of the Pentateuch and the ideology of fornication with the reformist and procreationist ideas of the Pythagorean philosophers. The key to his interpretation is his reading of the Tenth commandment of the Decalogue, in which he argues that sexual activity must be seen in religious terms and for that reason must be strictly controlled. Philo lays the ground for a paradigm shift in biblical sexual norms, but himself remains conservative and resists the conclusion that transgressing procreationism is tantamount to </page> <page sequence="230">  part two apostasy. This was taken a decisive step further by Clement, who regards any deviation from God’s procreationist law as rebellion. Reviews: V. Burrus, JECS  () –; K.

Gambetti,The Alexandrian Riots of C.E. and their Impli- cations for the Experience of the Jews of the Diaspora: a Historical Assess- ment (diss. The University of California at Berkeley ). In the summer of  c.e. the Jewish community of Alexandria in Egypt was brutally persecuted. An edict issued by the Roman prefect Flaccus, by declaring the Jews foreigners, cancelled their π λ τευμα containing all their privileges. The Alexandrian citizens, after having destroyed the Jews’ homes, shops and synagogues, pushed them into a small part of the city. Punishment and torture were reserved to those who would try to cross the limits of that quarter. This event was the explosion of a situation which had existed in Alexandria for a very long time, and which had ripened over the last year. In  the emperor Gaius had endorsed the position of the Alexandrian citizens against the rights of residence of the Jews, and had adjudicated in that sense. In  Gaius sent Flaccus hismandate, also containing orders about the transformation of the previous adjudication into policy. By issuing the edict Flaccus executed imperial orders. The social situation of Alexandria proved to be the proper environment for the riots. The translation of old anti-Jewish Egyptian traditions into Greek first (making those stories available to a Hellenic audience), and, later, the advancement of a part of the Hellenized Egyptian population into the body politic, transformed the Alexandrian civic institutions, especially the gymnasium, into a hot-bed for anti-Jewish sentiments. In  these people were successful in turning their bias into a judicial case, which the emperor endorsed. An embassy to Gaius in  was not enough for the Jews to re-establish their privileges. The emperor did not withdraw from his decision taken two years earlier. Only Claudius in  would make some efforts to bring the life of the Alexandrian Jews back to an acceptable situation. In the analysis of these events constant use is made of source material provided by Philo.

Goldenberg,The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Princeton ). Goldenberg investigates how the so-called Curse of Ham, based on Gen :–, came to be understood as a justification for Black slavery. The book is organized into four parts: () a chronological study of early Jewish views of the Black African, () an examination of Jewish attitudes toward dark skin color, () a history of Black slavery, and () a study of the effect of the historical identification of Blacks with slavery upon Jewish, Christian, and Islamic biblical interpretation. While the Bible itself does not link Blacks with slavery, ‘the increasing association of Black with slave in the Near East’ and the incorrect but recognized etymology of Ham as ‘dark, brown, or black’ influenced later interpretation of the biblical passage (p. ). Because Philo understands the blackness of the Ethiopians to represent evil, some writers considered him to be ‘the only exception to a lack of racism and prejudice in the ancient Greek world’ (p. ). Goldenberg defends him against this charge, however, by noting that Philo was drawing upon commonly accepted color symbolism. (EB) 20358. L.

Modern biblical scholars continue to debate how central the covenant is to the Hebrew Bible. Grabbe surveys Second Temple literature (both biblical and non-biblical) and concludes that while the notion is important in some sources, ‘a significant number of writers and writings do not mention ‘covenant’ or show no interest in the concept’ (p. ). Philo and Josephus must be classified among this latter group. Without knowing Hebrew, Philo uses the term δια  κη, the Septuagint translation of theHebrew brit. His understanding is thus conditioned by the primary sense of the Greek word as a will or testament rather than of the Hebrew word as a mutual agreement between God and humans, and he emphasizes the covenant as a freely given divine gift. After discussing several Philonic passages which mention δια  κη, Grabbe observes that Philo uses the word with a range of associations that include the wise man as God’s heir, God’s gift of grace, God’s law, God’s word, divine justice, the intelligible world, </page> <page sequence="232">  part two and God’s gift of himself. Josephus never uses ‘covenant’ in a theological sense, probably because the notion did not serve his aims in addressing his Greco- Roman readers. (EB) 20359. P.

The author recognizes that Philo’s silence about himself does not allow us to put together a biographical narrative. If we want to get to know him, it is necessary in her view to ‘read his works tirelessly.’ This is exactly what she has done, as the gripping spiritual portrait which she offers us bears witness. After a guided tour of Alexandria, the city where Philo was born and lived, she describes his cultural universe, which also includes a description of the terrible anti-Jewish riots which marked his final years. Chapters five to eight deal with Philo’s view of Judaism, his biblical commentaries, his method of philosophizing, and his thought. A final chapter entitled ‘Philo, Church Father honoris causa’ (the phrase is taken from David Runia’s study on the subject) rounds off this excellent introduction to the man whom Edouard Herriot called ‘the glory of the Jewish school of Alexandria’.

This revision of a  Ph.D. dissertation prepared at Macquarie University, Sydney, investigates the extent to which Paul interacts with the Greco-Roman benefaction ideology of 1 ρις. To explore how Greek-speaking Judaism was affected by Greco-Roman benefaction ideology, Philo and Josephus are exam- ined. Harrison surveys modern scholarship on Philonic 1 ρις and concludes that scholars have abstracted the terminology of 1 ρις from its historical con- text. He then examines Philo’s use of 1 ρις in contexts of divine benefaction to show that Philo’s readers would have understood him against the backdrop of honorific inscriptions. Turning to the motif of reciprocity, Harrison shows that Philo’s treatment distorts the focus of the Mosaic Law on God’s redemptive love as incentive to generosity by substituting it with reciprocity. Finally, he exam- ines Cher. – to show how Philo unabashedly criticizes the institution of beneficence. (KAF) 20363. D. M.

This study explores the literary structure and rhetorical devices of Philo’s treatiseContempl. Primary attention is given to its references toGreek, Egyptian, and Jewish texts, groups such as the Essenes, and individuals other than the Therapeutae. The author discusses Philo’s harsh criticism of Xenophon and Plato, and the descriptions of contemplative life, pagan worship, and banquets. All this raises the questions as to how Philo himself was connected with the Therapeutae and who the intended audiences of the treatise were. (KAF) 20364. A.

The dietary laws fall under the tenth commandment,  upsilonlenisκ 'πι υμ σεις.

In his general conclusion Houston states that ‘in their broad contentions, Philo, Milgrom and Douglas may be accounted correct’ (p. ).

These authors include Philo of Alexan- dria, Flavius Josephus, Aristobulus, and the so-called ‘minor’ Jewish authors (Eupolemus, Ezekiel the Tragedian, Artapanus etc.).The study aims to shed new light on the quotation process as exploited by the bishop of Caesarea through the particular case of the Jewish authors. Eusebius’ treatment of Philo occupies an important part of this study because of the abundance of Philonic testimonies cited by Eusebius, especially in the PE. Each Jewish author is not treated sep- arately. Instead, the viewpoint from which Eusebius sees them is adopted. In most cases, Philo is presented by the latter as a ‘Hebrew.’The author argues that this appellation constitutes a crucial rhetorical device in order to appropriate Philo’s texts. According to the author’s analysis, Eusebius’ insistence on Philo’s ‘Hebrew-ness’ in the PE enables him to turn the philosopher into a most useful predecessor, the pre-Christian theologian par excellence. The passages in which he deals with the Logos are especially useful in this respect, since he identifies Philo’s Logos as Christ. However, Eusebius’ endeavour is not only a theologi- cal one, but also, and more importantly, an apologetic one: his re-interpretation of Philo enables him to demonstrate that Christianity is a unified theological system more ancient, hence better, than that of the Greeks. At the same time, the synthesis made by Philo between the Jewish Scripture and Greek philos- ophy enables Eusebius to compare Christian and Greek philosophy. Therefore, Philo becomes amost important link betweenChristianity andHellenism. In the DE, on the other hand, Philo is mentioned only once, in a historical-apologetic context. It is argued that this passage accurately illustrates the manner in which Eusebius occasionally distorts quotations of Jewish authors for apologetic pur- poses in the DE. With regard to the text of Eusebius’ citations in the PE, he gen- erally proves to cite Philo faithfully, although certain differences between Philo’s and Eusebius’ manuscripts seem to indicate that Eusebius occasionally modified Philo’s text in theologically significant passages. The author also argues that if Eusebius certainly knew Philo first hand, he may have collected excerpts in the form of florilegia for his own use. Finally, the author insists on Eusebius’ original- ity in dealing with Philo: not only did he use theological and historical passages that were rarely quoted by the Church Fathers, but he also explicitly acknowl- edged, as it were, the debt of Christianity to Philo. Yet one should bear in mind that Eusebius’ use of Philo in the PE and the DE was above all apologetic. (DTR; based on the author’s summary) 20369. H.

In the Armenian translation of QG . Philo is reported as explaining the place name  αραν at Gen :, but the actual biblical text in both the MT and the LXX reads αραδ.

Although psalms were probably sung during the Jewish worship service in the Second Temple and in the synagogue, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Jewish singing of psalms, or psalmody, in either of these locales had a direct influence on Christian psalmody. The group banquet, however, was a form of worship shared by both Jews and Christians, and it is likely that Philo’s account of the singing at the banquet of the Therapeutae has a direct bearing upon psalm singing by later Christians. Philo’s account in Contempl. displays a sophisticated understanding of music and reflects much in common with musical practices at Greek symposia. Early Christians such as Clement, Tertullian, Hippolytus and Eusebius describe similar kinds of singing after meals, and the last-named author refers to Philo’s account explicitly. It is often thought that Philo’s use of the word ‘antiphon’ denotes singing in alternation, but Jeffery argues that Philo is instead referring to ‘two concurrent renditions [by men and women] an octave apart’ (p. ). Later Christians, however, were unaware of Philo’s technical sense of the word and instead used ‘antiphon’ to refer to alternating choirs. (EB) 20371. F.

A careful reading of accounts of embassies, of Philo’s narrative in Legat., of the Letter of Claudius to the Alexandrians and the polemical literature known as the Acts of the Alexandrian martyrs, allows the author to sketch a rich tableau of diplomatic relations between Rome and Alexandria in the first two centuries of the Roman Empire. Precious information is furnished on the personalities of the ambassadors and the purpose of the embassies, on the organization of the Imperial cult, on protests relating to daily life and civic institutions, and on the adjudication between communities. The profound gulf that existed between theGreeks and Jews of Alexandria and the insolent behaviour of certain Alexandrian citizens sometimes led to the transformation of imperial audiences into veritable legal trials which resulted in the condemnation to death of a notable citizen of the city.

In a section on Hellenistic Judaism Philo is closely linkedwith theWisdomof Solomon. Brief remarks are devoted to the doctrine of the Logos, concluding with the assertion that ‘Philo has consid- erably increased the dynamism of the conception of God’ (p. ).

(DTR) 20373. K. Klun, The Decalogue in Jewish and Christian Philosophy [Slovenian] (diss. Ljubljana ). The thesis considers the main differences between Jewish and Christian understanding (‘philosophy’) of the Ten commandments. Its first section gives background on the origin and the role of the Decalogue with the entire Mosaic legal code. The main part of the thesis deals with Philo, whose treatment of the Decalogue can be viewed under three headings: as a summary of the Torah; as a collection of themost important legal and religious principles; and as the nucleus of the Sinaitic revelation. Through an extensive treatment of the Mosaic law in his Greek exegetical opus, Philo tries to show to a philosophical audience within the Greco-Roman world that the ten God-given principles (heads) embrace a complete legislation given in the Sinai desert. He even goes on to meet the expectations of his Greek contemporaries in Alexandria by an extended legal and moralistic analysis of each commandment, using a contemporary Greek philosophical and religious terminology. Philo’s opinion is in fact quite revolutionary when he argues that the state (π λις) based on a divine law is not a Platonic idealistic illusion, but a historical fact, as proven in the Biblical ‘Mosaic Constitution,’ and by the Jewish homeland and the diaspora reality. The creation story in Genesis serves him as a preamble to the Constitution, and he also considers the Ten Commandments preambles to different groups of laws, as well as being a code of the principles of natural law, a popular term among first-century philosophers. Another important feature of Philo’s treatment is Neopythagorean approach to the number ten and to arithmology in general, as well as the allegorical method of the interpretation of the Bible in general, probably the most important contribution of Philo to the Western (Christian) method of reading the Old Testament. Philo is thus the first sage in the history of Greek philosophy to fuse the Biblical (Jewish) and Greek language, religion, morality and thought into a unique system of universal religious philosophy. For this reason he, though a Jew, was even given the title church father honoris causa. The final part of the thesis presents an analysis of some of the most important Early Christian documents on the Decalogue and on Jewish law (The New Testament, theGnosticLetter of Ptolemaeus to Flora, theDidascalia apostolorum, Irenaeus of Lyon (Adversos haereses) and some other Church fathers).

This monograph, based on a McMaster Ph.D. completed in  (cf. RRS ), examines Philo’s indebtedness to Greek philosophical notions of higher law and how Philo mapped the connection between the higher law and the Law of Moses. The Mosaic law is discussed only in terms of its external relationship to Greek notions of higher law. Martens sets out to explore whether Philo’s use of three concepts of higher law—the law of nature, the unwritten law, and the living law—which Philo alone of all ancient writers discusses, renders the Mosaic law superfluous for some people. More than anyone else in antiquity, Philo attempts to make explicit the wide-ranging content of the law of nature. Martens gives a descriptive overview of four major strands of Greek thought on ‘nature’ as they come to expression in Philo: as the power of life and growth, as the inherent character of any thing or being, as the order of the cosmos, </page> <page sequence="239"> critical studies   and as God. For Philo there is a transcendent God who stands over nature and creation, and so nature can act as a bridge through which humanity can come to know God because it bears God’s ethical imprint. Hence there is for Philo a intimate relationship between law and nature. Philo’s distinctive contribution lies in his accounts of wise men who actually fulfilled the law of nature, his overlapping of the unwritten law with the law of nature, and in his assertion that certain people are themselves unwritten laws.

The article deals with different cultural and political roles which the Greek language has played during its long history. An assumption of the Library of Alexandria was that the Greek language could represent the universal culture. Within this historical framework the version of the Bibel or Septuagint repre- sented for Philo and other Alexandrian Jews the universal diffusion of a particu- lar ‘text’: the Law ofMoses. When the Greco-Roman culture converted to Chris- tianity and wanted to spread this text as a part of its Christian faith, it found that some of the surrounding nations lacked a written language. The Greek alpha- bet and morphology, then, acted as a basis for producing new writing methods and linguistic developments.

Martin, ‘Philo’s Use of Syncrisis: an Examination of Phil- onic Composition in the Light of Progymnasmata,’ Perspectives in Reli- gious Studies  () –. In contrast to earlier studies on Philo’s use of rhetoric, which have gen- erally referred to rhetorical handbooks for training in ‘the more narrow art of [oral] declamation’ (p. ), Martin considers Philo in relation to πρ γυ- μν σματα, preliminary exercises for training in written composition. Though only one of the four extant progymnasmata dates from the first century c.e., the later ones (third through fifth centuries c.e.) preserve traditional curric- ula and are thus relevant. Martin focuses specifically upon the technique of syncrisis, or comparison. The progymnasmata curricula address kinds of com- parisons (good with good, bad with bad, good with bad), topics for compar- ison (goods of the mind, goods of the body, and external goods), represen- tative and numerical comparisons (individual examples or a genus of exem- plary members), and ways of organizing larger works (through separate or combined comparisons). Martin provides several Philonic examples of syn- crisis to show that Philo, a master of rhetorical skill, reflects familiarity with the range of comparisons described in the progymnasmata, particularly in the curriculum represented by Pseudo-Hermogenes (third/fourth century c.e.).

Calabi (ed.), Italian Studies on Philo of Alexandria, Studies in Philo of Alexandria and Mediterranean Antiquity  (Boston ) –. The author deals with various Philonic passages in which a terminology typical of the mysteries is used. Scholars widely differ in their views, ranging from the claim that Jewish mysteries did exist in the Hellenistic world to the consideration of the use of certain terms only as literary formulae. Philo expresses a negative evaluation of pagan mysteries. The mysteries of God, on the other hand, acquire their value in that they lead to knowledge of the divine. An ethical perfection emerges, determined by the formation of a harmonious ordering of the components of human nature; the perspective is that of a happiness open to all those that seek it. A study of Philo’s ‘mystical’ terminology thus turns out to touch upon fundamental theses of Philonic thought.

S.M.Nadler, ‘Spinoza and Philo: theAllegedMysticism in the Ethics,’ in J. Miller and B. Inwood (edd.), Hellenistic and Early Modern Philosophy (Cambridge ) –. The author, who is Spinoza’s biographer and a leading exponent of his thought, is strongly opposed to the view that the Dutch–Jewish philosopher’s metaphysics can be seen as a mystically inclined pantheism (or pan-entheism) which was ultimately, if unconsciously, derived from the Kabbalah. One way of illustrating the issues involved is to make a comparison between Spinoza and his distant Jewish predecessor Philo. The main body of the article consists of insightful analyses of the main lines of theological thought espoused by the two thinkers. Philo is a mystic in Nadler’s use of the term for three reasons. The human being requires either divine revelation or an act of divine grace to obtain a true knowledge of God’s existence, but even so the full knowledge of God’s essence simply remains beyond reach. Spinoza on the other hand sees the </page> <page sequence="242">  part two intellectual love of God as central to the human quest for happiness, but unlike Philo he is supremely confident in the ability of the human being to achieve full understanding ofGod’s naturewithout receiving any kind of divine aid.Noother philosopher had such optimism in the cognitive powers of the human being. Thus the approaches that the two thinkers develop on the subject of human knowledge of God are diametrically opposed. (DTR) 20387. H.

The Biblical Stories Retold and Interpreted in Jewish and Christian Traditions, Themes in Biblical Narrative  (Leiden ) –. Najman argues that Philo’s interpretation of Cain andAbel is typological, with Cain representing the type of wickedness, and Abel exemplifying the type of holiness.They are the archetypes of good and evil and their conflict is the conflict between good and evil in every human soul. Cain is a self-lover. He becomes a farmer and is called a tiller of the soil because he refers all things to his own mind, not realising that the land belongs to God. Due to his self-love he does not bring an offer to God immediately. By way of contrast, Abel is a lover of God, as his name signifies (it means ‘one who refers all things to God’). He becomes a shepherd, which is a good preparation for rulership. According to Najman ‘the story of Cain and Abel is important because they exemplify the ways in which the archetypes of virtue and vice may come to leave their copies upon the human soul’ (p. ).

In biblical and para-biblical texts of the Second Temple period, the signif- icance of Moses expands as authoritative laws are amplified and attributed to him and as Moses himself is idealized as an authority figure with several roles. The Book of Deuteronomy is a model for these trends, which characterize what Najman terms ‘Mosaic discourse.’ Four features of this discourse are that the new text that reworks older traditions () claims for itself the authority of the earlier traditions; () portrays itself as having the status of Torah; () re-presents the Sinaitic revelation; and () claims a link to or authorship by Moses. Najman examines the Mosaic discourse in Deuteronomy, Jubilees, the Temple Scroll, and Philo. The political situation in Alexandria requires Philo to authorize Jewish law for both Jews and non-Jews, which he does in several ways. He presents Mosaic law as superior to laws of all other peoples and claims that it is a copy of the law of nature. In associating Mosaic law with universal concepts like the law of nature, Philo achieves ‘a strikingly original fusion’ (p. ), in which Mosaic law is not subordinate to the universal ideas. Mosaic law is also not reducible to a written code of rules, because the lives of the patriarchs and of Moses are </page> <page sequence="243"> critical studies   copies of the law of nature too (p. ). Philo elevates Moses to a god-like but human figure. Two features that distinguish Philo’s Mosaic discourse from that in other works are that the law of Moses becomes subordinate to the figure of Moses, instead of the other way around, and Philo distinguishes between Mosaic writings and his own interpretations, even though he attributes these interpretations to Moses. Exploring continuities between Second Temple and rabbinic literature, Najman finds, among other things, that it is ‘misleading’ to identify Philo’s notion of ‘unwritten law’ with what came to be known as rabbinic oral law, or Torah she-b#al peh (p. ).

Law andNature in Hellenistic Phi- losophy and Philo of Alexandria=The Studia Philonica Annual , Brown Judaic Series  (Providence RI ) –. As with the early Stoics and Cicero, if the superior law of nature is unwritten and transcends the written law of any community, then to link it intimately with the written law revealed by God, as Philo does, can be seen as incoherent and paradoxical. An exploration of Philo’s thinking does not entirely remove the paradox, but it does illuminate an inner logic. To begin, the law of nature and the Law of Moses have the same source and legislator, God. But more to the point both have a similar structure. Just as the law of nature is exemplified, not by a code of actions but by the rational disposition of the sage that enables the sage to act in accordance with the law of nature, so too, the written law of Moses, when read within the context of an interpretive community, is a reminder and expression of the lives of the patriarchs and Moses.

The author examines a range of sources to show that discussions about prophecy and ecstasy are less concerned to understand these experiences in themselves than to set limits on who can have access to divine knowledge, to establish the authority of one’s own group, and to define community identity. Although she focuses mainly on early Christian debates (especially as reflected in Paul, Tertullian, and Epiphanius), the author also considers Artemidorus, Plato, and Philo. The discussion of Philo (pp. –) centres on his treatise Her. Using Dionysian cultic language and a fourfold taxonomy of ecstasy similar to Plato’s, he highlights the abandonment of body, sense perception and logos to allow for ‘the rising of the divine mind’ (p. ) during a state of ‘ecstasy and inspired possession andmadness’ (Her. ). In Philo’s account, when one leaves behind the shallow, human realms of knowledge, one can receive the ‘truly rich inheritance’ of divine knowledge (p. ).

Niehoff, ‘Circumcision as a Marker of Identity: Philo, Origen and Genesis Rabbah on Gen. :–,’ Jewish Studies Quarterly  () –. This article examines the nature of the considerable change in attitude among Jews toward circumcision from the time of Philo to the composition of Gen- esis Rabbah. Special attention is given to the questions whether and to what extent Christianity played a role and whether rabbinic exegetes knew ecclesi- astical positions and responded to them. Tracing exegetical trajectories from Philo through Paul, Justin Martyr and Origen, to the rabbis shows that the parting of the ways between Judaism and Christianity was rather more pro- longed and gradual. A detailed exegetical study of Philo’s interpretation of Abra- ham’s circumcision shows how Philo divorced circumcision from covenant, and yet did not disregard the practice altogether because the practice ultimately restores man’s original virility and his Adamic likeness to the image of God. (KAF) 20392. J. N. Novoa, ‘The Appropriation of Jewish Thought by Chris- tianity. The Cases of Philo of Alexandria and Leone Ebreo,’ Science et Esprit  () –. Philo and Leone Ebreo (ca. –) are two examples of Jewish thinkers whose works were embraced primarily by Christians rather than Jews. Although both writers were committed Jews, they believed in ‘the concept of allegory and the layered reading for sacred and profane texts’ (p. ), and they drew upon non-Jewish ways of thinking in order to make Judaism more intelligible to out- siders and, in Philo’s case, to seek proselytes among them. Philo incorporated Neoplatonic and Stoic ideas, while Ebreo used Patristic thought and the writ- ings of G. Boccaccio on pagan gods. Paradoxically, for this very reason, while not officially banned by their co-religionists these Jewish writers were ‘consigned to irrelevance’ by them (p. ). Both writers were instead taken up by Chris- tians who were more sympathetic to the outside elements in these Jewish works and who overlooked the original motivations behind these works. Philo was embraced by early Church Fathers and Ebreo by ‘the courtly society of Renais- sance Europe’ (p. ). It was centuries before Jews showed interest in either of these thinkers. (EB) 20393.

The article starts with a discussion of the Logos philosophy existent in Philo’s time and Philo’s ‘triple inflection’ of it: Philo gives the Logos (the intermediary realm between God and his creatures) a personal quality; he inserts Logos- thinking in a context of grace; and he develops the social aspect of Logos, repre- </page> <page sequence="245"> critical studies   sented by the Law of Moses which enables people to practise  ιλαν ρωπ α and its synonym κ ινων α towards one another. O’Leary then offers a profound and detailed analysis of Philo’sConf., startingwith the treatise’s guiding concerns (the quest for authentic κ ινων α and the role of the logos/Logos, and the demon- stration that Israel has realized this κ ινων α more fully than other groups), then exploring Philo’s discussion with his allegorical predecessors regarding the meaning of the Babel story, and finally (the most extensive part of the article) giving an insightful presentation of the line of argument of the treatise. He con- cludes that, having confounded the false language of false κ ινων α, God creates a new κ ινων α. At the end of his paper the author poses the question ‘Can the connection between Logos and κ ινων α in Philo be seen as a background to the Johannine writings?’ His answer is that the differences between the Philonic and Johannine worlds make direct influence seem implausible; ‘the tried and tested paths of Hellenistic reason, so familiar to Philo, seem unknown to John, whose writings are the utterances of a contemplative community bearing wit- ness to an event of revelation, and contain no metaphysical discussion’ (p. ).

Although the idea of the Logos as a form of nourishment plays only a relatively minor role in Philo’s thought (especially in the passage Leg. .– ), it nevertheless appears to have had a great and long-lasting impact on the Christian theologians. The article traces this impact, commencing with Origen and ending with Cyril of Alexandria. (DTR) 20395. A. Passoni dell’Acqua, ‘Upon Philo’s Biblical Text and the Septuagint,’ in F.

The article gives a detailed survey of scholarly work done on Philo’s use of scripture, and in particular on the text he uses when he quotes from scripture. Very few studies have been carried out in recent years and it is noted that a number of questions should be revisited, because there are now newer critical editions of the Septuagint available. The author is attracted to the view that scripture and commentary should not be rigorously separated because Philo regards them as intertwined.This view permits him to engage in a free rendering of the biblical text in the course of his commentaries. In an excursus at the end of the article a comparison ismade between the Septuagint text in the Göttingen critical edition and the version quoted by Philo in Leg.  in the texts printed by Colson and the French edition. Some valuable textual observations are made and the following conclusion is reached (p. ): ‘The fact that the text chosen by </page> <page sequence="246">  part two Philo largely conforms to the Septuagint leads us to reaffirm, even in a limited study like this, that Philo freely chose which biblical text to follow (either the Septuagint or the Hebrew).’ (DTR) 20396.

This paper investigates questions relating to the deprivation of God in the thought of Hans Jonas based on Gnostic writings, in particular on those of Philo Judaeus and those inNag-Hammadi, and the nihilistic and existentialistic- philosophical implications of the same. In relation to Gnosticism Jonas points to humanity having conceived of itself in late ancient Gnostic teachings as a being based upon oneself, in relation to which God in the universe and in His own creation became excessive. Therefore, such Gnosticism opens the door to a nihilism, which, in its tyrannical reign, poses itself as its own ‘moral law,’ and which at the same time, abolishes any responsibility. Something similar is also valid of an existence that imposes itself and that, in this self-imposition, rejects all norms and responsibility. (DTR; based on author’s summary) 20397. B. A. Pearson, ‘Cracking a Conundrum: Christian Origins in Egypt,’ StudiaTheologica  () –. Due to the silence of our sources on the origins of Christianity in Egypt until the early nd century, historians have been forced to argue backwards from nd century sources. The author, in addition to acknowledging this procedure and thus focusing on the Epistle of Barnabas and the Teachings of Silvanus in this article, also suggests that the firstChristians of Egyptweremembers of the Jewish communities there. Hence he draws on Jewish sources in order to be able to say something on the kind of Jewish religiosity influencing the first Christians in Alexandria. For this purpose Philo is an important source. Accordingly, before commenting on the Epistle of Barnabas and the Teachings of Silvanus, Pearson sketches some issues of Alexandrian Judaism as evidenced in Philo’s works, especially his messianism. Philo is considered a proponent of ‘realized eschatology.’ Finally, when recognizing that we do not know what Philo thought about the Jesus-believing Jews hemight have encountered, Pearson suggests that some of them may even have been his pupils.

In opposition to this grand cup-bearer he places on three occasions (§§, , ) another cup-bearer, the ‘cup- bearer of God’ who, according to the author’s analysis of three passages, is the archetype of Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and, at an even higher level, a figure of the Logos.

The author focuses on the interpretation of the Giants in Gen :– and makes reference to Philo’s Gig., and in particular to the theoretical and philo- sophical aspects of their allegorical interpretation. Philo does not divide the angels into categories (cf. p. ) and so does not distinguish between fallen and undefiled angels, and so does also not postulate substantial differences between angels, demons and souls.He limits himself to interpreting the biblical passage in an allegorical sense by interpreting the giants as symbols of pleasure. According to Philo, those who carry the title of angels know the daughters of right reason (virtue) but go beyond it to the mortal descendants of human beings, i.e. plea- sures. In a word, the Giants represent the hedonists, and for this reason there is not a single trace of superstition or mythology (referring to the myth of the Titans, p. ) in the Bible. (RR) 203101. H.

This study examines the interpretations of the creation account in Genesis by Philo and Augustine, who both assign a noteworthy role to the soul in creation. In dealing with Philo, Post offers first an introductory section about Philo’s life, writings, and exegetical methods. In Opif. Philo interprets the creation of the world in Platonic terms: God first created the noetic world and afterwards the visible world. The noetic world is placed in God’s Logos. Philo regards the creation ofman and woman as the creation of ν upsilontildeς (mind) and αBσ ησις (sense- perception): Man is ν upsilontildeς, God’s image, and woman is αBσ ησις, which belongs to the world of becoming. Sense-perception and mind need each other, the nous is made as a help for the mind. According to Post we find here Pythagoras’ Table of opposites: Nous, i.e. man, belongs to the realm of the noetic, the good, and the divine. Woman, i.e. the senses, belongs to the earthly and changeable world. As the senses are subordinate to the mind, so woman is subordinate to man. According to Philo, the purpose in life is to become like God. Because God’s image inman is his nous and the senses do not have part in God’s image, woman is left out. Augustine follows Philo in his reading of the creation account. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="248">  part two 203102. R.

The figure of the lawgiver in Philo is studied here especially from the philo- sophical point of view, comparing it with the similar conceptions found in Plato (both in his ‘idealistic’ phase of the Republic and in his realistic phase in the Laws) and the Stoics. In Plato the idea that the author of the Laws is also the cre- ator of the cosmos ismissing, but it would seem to be implicit in the Stoic system (positive law is based on natural law and both depend on the Logos which cre- ates, or rather structures, the cosmos). This correspondence becomes explicit and central in Philo, as indeed it is in Aristobulus. (RR) 203103. R. Radice, ‘The “Nameless Principle” from Philo to Plotinus: an Outline of Research,’ in F.

In this study the author offers a ‘short sketch of one approach to linking Philo to Plotinus on the question of God’s unnameableness, ineffability and unknowableness’ (p. ). It emerges that the theme of ineffability is rich in meaning. It is connected to two central questions, the (positive) infinity of the Principle and the value and representativeness of a ‘name.’ In relation to the former Philo marks the moment of change within Platonism, while Numenius represents an intermediate position. In relation to the latter Plotinus continues the Platonic tradition, whereas Philo and the Gnostics take a different route based on a strong conception of a name. (DTR) 203104. E.

The clean aquatic animals, for instance, symbolize freedom from passions, whereas the unclean animals represent a life of pleasure. It is forbidden to eat carnivores because they are wild and agressive, and therefore not suitable for a gentle soul. (ACG) 203106. C.

There are two traditions on the founding of Alexandria, one that it was planned and built by Alexander himself, the other that he made use of the famous architect Dinocrates of Rhodes. This background is relevant to Philo’s interpretation of the Genesis creation account, in which he makes extensive use of the commentary tradition of Plato’s Timaeus, and in particular to the image that he uses at Opif. – to illustrate how God created the cosmos. The article gives a translation and detailed analysis of Opif. –, discussing in sequence the interpretation of ‘day one’ in the Genesis account, the noetic cosmos, the role of the noetic cosmos in creation, the contents of ‘day one’ according to Moses, the location of the noetic cosmos, the image itself, the application of the image to the creation of the cosmos, the general interpretation of the passage, and finally a brief treatment of some other related themes. It is argued that Philo in his image tries to have it both ways. In the image the functions of king, architect and builder are kept separate, in its application the persons involved are coalesced, the reason being that Philo refuses to accept a split-level theology in the manner of Middle Platonism. The article concludes with some reflections on Philo’s relation to the development of the Platonist tradition up to his time, and a brief epilogue on the use of Philo’s image in later Christian tradition and by Rabbi Hoshai#a of Caesarea, the friend of Origen (whowas no doubt his source).

Ulrichsen (edd.), Neotestamentica et Philonica: Studies in Honor of Peder Borgen, Supplements to Novum Testamentum  (Leiden ) –. The prologue of Philo’s Legat. is a remarkable passage which has given rise to a number of interpretative difficulties. The article first outlines various scholarly discussions that have been held about the passage, including whether there is a lacuna between it and the rest of the treatise. The author advocates a contextual reading, inwhich an attempt ismade to relate the theological contents of the passage to the historical/apologetic contents of the rest of the work. This contextual reading takes up the largest part of the paper. It is concluded (p. ) that the contents of the passage are closely related to the subject matter of the whole work, with as its chief theme the role of divine providence. The theological section §§– has a triple purpose: to explain the special relationship between God and Israel; to locate the role of providence within the divine nature; to anticipate the theme of the purported rivalry between God and the megalomaniac emperor Gaius. The text is difficult because Philo does not make all the connections in his train of thought clear, but it is not necessary to conclude that it is incomplete.

Reydams-Schils (ed.), Plato’s Timaeus as Cultural Icon (Notre Dame ) –. The aim of the article is to examine the role that Plato’s Timaeus and the tradition of its interpretation played in the questions of first principles and the relation between God and creation in Philo and early Christian thought. First background issues are sketched, including a summary of schemes of first principles in Platonist thought, based on the research of Matthias Baltes. The article then first analyzes a number of Philonic texts, notably Opif. , Prov. .– , .–. Philo’s thought is continued by Justin and Clement. Characteristic of their views is that matter is not really regarded as a principle in the full sense. God is the sole creator and first principle of reality, but for a philosophical account of created reality something beside God is required. The author uses the term ‘monarchic dualism’ to represent this position. Next the thought of Tatian, Theophilus and Irenaeus is discussed. In their case too there can be no question that matter is not a principle beside God. In their view matter is created by God, i.e. the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, but it is difficult for them to avoid the derivationist language of Platonism when they try to explain how this occurs. The final part of the article gives a brief survey of later treatment of the same question in Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine. It concludes with a question: is it a coincidence that both Platonism and Christian thought give up the basic creational model of the Timaeus involving multiple principles at the same time?

The chapter forms part of a substantial volume devoted to the theme of theodicy in ancient Near Eastern, biblical and Jewish texts (Greek philosoph- ical texts are conspicuous by their absence). The first part of the article gives background material on Philo and the main features of his Judaism, followed by similar material on theodicy in the Greek philosophical tradition. In the main body of the article texts on the theme in Philo’s writings are analyzed, beginning with his two books on Providence, which focus heavily on the theme and are strongly indebted to Greek philosophical models, followed by passages from the exegetical works (esp. Opif. –, –, Abr. , Praem. –, Det. –, Post. –, QG .). The final section treats the theme in rela- tion to the contemporary situation of the Jews, as depicted especially in Flacc. and Legat. The author concludes that Philo uses four main strategies in con- fronting the theological problem of God’s responsibility for evil. Firstly God is consistently dissociated from the causation of any kind of evil. Secondly Philo argues that apparent evils contribute to the good of the whole. Thirdly he is convinced that God in his concern for the world always has positive intentions. Fourthly, when all else fails, he resorts to the argument that God’s ways are inscrutable and only known to Himself. Of these it is the third that </page> <page sequence="252">  part two has his preference.

This article focuses on one section of Plato’s Timaeus (c–d) and on Philo’s description of the fixed stars. Its main point is to stress those features of the fixed and everlasting circle in Plato’s account which are used and slightly modified in the Philonic conception of the fixed stars. (JPM) 203114. E.

This paper examines in detail one of the three Philonic quotations of Pindar: Aet. –, quoting Pindar’s fr. c Snell-Maehler, which is about the transfor- mation of Delos from a wandering to a steady island. After a survey of the Pin- daric and extra-Pindaric sources of the myth and a discussion of Philo’s peculiar interpretation of the fragment, the author investigates the Philonic occurrences of the verb α8ν ττεσ αι (and cognate words): they appear to be a key to an inter- pretative theory of textual meaning, in which Gentile poetical tradition and bib- lical authority sometimes merge.

After some introductory comments on models and perspectives for under- standing violence, and a brief presentation of Philo, this essay deals with Philo’s representations of violence under the following headings: ‘Philo as a wit- ness/victim of anti-Jewish violence’ (pp. –), and ‘Philo as a witness of intra-Jewish violence,’ the latter including his presentations of ‘some cases of vio- lence in the Hebrew Bible,’ and possible ‘cases of establishment violence’ in his expositions of Spec.

This volume forms a supplement to the author’s Introduction to the Septu- agint (on which see ). He first corrects some mistakes and makes some additions to the previous volume. A new chapter deals with the reception of the Septuagint. Philo is one of the first witnesses for the circulation and cen- tral role of the Septuagint in Hellenistic Judaism. His knowledge of the Hebrew language is limited to the use of onomastica. It is well known that the Greek Torah, i.e. the Nomos, is at the centre of his exegesis with  citations (against  of other Septuagint texts). Siegert notes that Philo’s exegesis of the Psalms tends to a psychological approach. Moreover there are also some first indica- tions of fixed sequences of citations.

Philo marks the end of genealogical thinking (see Abr. , Congr. ). His portrait of Abraham reveals him as a symbol of faith. He is the symbol of obedience to the law, indeed he is typified as a ‘living law’ (Abr. ). Ultimately he is the symbol of knowledge of God (‘Gotteserkenntnis’). The fragments of the treatise De Deo show this through the exegesis of the vision of God in Gen  (especially in §§, ). It is emphasized that Philo’s Logos-doctrine is the pre-eminent background of Christian Logos-theology (see QE .). All this has value as a good common basis for Christian–Jewish dialogue. (GS) 203119. D. Smith, From Symposium to Eucharist: the Banquet in the Early Christian World (Minneapolis ). The author’s explicit hypothesis in this work is that in order to understand any individual instance of formalized meals in the Greco-Roman world, one must first understand the larger phenomenon of the banquet as a social institution. The banquet was namely, according to the author, a social institution that cut across ethnic, religious, and social lines. The study thus intends to define the banquet as a social institution and thereby provide a common model that can be utilized for the study of all data on formal meals from the Greco- Romanworld. Having thus defined the banquet, Smith proceeds by investigating and describing the Greco-Roman banquet; the philosophical banquet; the club banquet; the Jewish banquet; the banquet in the churches of Paul; the banquet in the Go spels; and the Banquet and Christian theology. In the chapter on The </page> <page sequence="254">  part two Jewish Banquet (pp. –), Smith deals with the Therapeutae on pp. – , providing a quote and some rephrasing comments on the gatherings of the Therapeutae.

The title of this article is a quotation from a letter by Samuel Coleridge about the relevance of Philo for understanding the New Testament. The author agrees with Coleridge, affirming that ‘the Philonic corpus is the single most important body of material from Second Temple Judaism for our understanding of the development of Christianity in the first and second centuries’ (p. ). Following an overview of Philo’s life and works, Sterling argues that Philo was part of ‘a long-standing exegetical tradition’ (p. )—as attested by Philo’s own awareness of Jewish exegetical predecessors and by awareness of his works shown in Jewish, pagan, and Christian sources. Sterling then provides specific examples of how Philo can inform understanding of the New Testament: he proposes that Philonic works can shed light on the tension between ontology and eschatology as reflected in Cor :– and Heb :– and :, on the concept of repentance as discussed in Acts :, and on various aspects of the prologue to the Gospel of John.

The clusters of common ethical laws in Philo’s Hypoth. §, Josephus’ C. Ap. , and Pseudo-Phocylides point to a common ethical tradition among Diaspora Jews of the Second Temple period. Most likely, the ethical instruction was oral and associated with instruction in the synagogue. As representative of Second Temple Jews, Philo, Josephus and Pseudo-Phocylides knew how to make the hermeneutical move that identified the immutable law of Moses with the immutable law of nature, a move that may have led Philo and Josephus to increase in severity the penalties for violation of the Mosaic law and to use natural law to prohibit homosexual relations. This hermeneutical move gave Jews the opportunity to counter charges of misanthropy and particularism levelled against them. Jews did not practice ridiculous and vulgar customs but the law of God.

Philo’s ‘Therapeutae’ Reconsidered (Oxford ). </page> <page sequence="255"> critical studies   Recognizing the ‘highly rhetorical’ nature of Philo’s idealized presentation of the Therapeutae, Taylor nonetheless believes that he wrote about a real rather than a fictive group, and she aims to establish what can be known about them. In the first part of the book, she explores the historical context of Contempl. (Philo’s primary intended audience, according to her, was the Emperor Claudius and other officials in Rome), the term ‘Therapeutae,’ the Essenes, the geographic and social locations of the group (including maps and photographs of Lake Mareotis and environs), the philosophy of Judaism adhered to by this group, the group’s allegorical and ascetic practices (she identifies the community as extreme allegorizers), and the solar calendar most likely followed by this group. The second part of the book focuses on women and gender in Contempl. Here Taylor considers paradigms of other women philosophers in antiquity (and includes photographs of artistic representations of these figures); Philo’s presentation of the female Therapeutae, or Therapeutrides; his descriptions of communal, personal, and sacred space (with illustrations); and his account of the group’s ‘spiritual and musical/mystical enterprise’ (p. ). Throughout the book Taylor draws upon other relevant evidence in order to place Philo’s discussions in a larger social, political, and philosophical context. Reviews: D. M.

This study explores how Paul’s argument in Cor :– would have been persuasive in its Hellenistic-Jewish context, particularly as it sought to combine appeals to Scripture, shame, and nature. Philo’s perspective offers helpful com- parisons to how Paul argues. Both appeal to the created order and its hierarchy of being as the basis for conduct. An examination of Philo’s use of  ρ1  shows how it signifies both source and sovereignty in a hierarchical relationship that is grounded in creation. (KAF) 203124. H. G.

This is illustrated by their understanding of creation. Philo emphasizes that the cosmos is created by God and that the human beings that live in it can tend to either good or evil. Their life is regulated by the Torah. For Origen creation results in the fall of humanity. Redemption is a ‘returning’ to the vision of God and the relationship with Him. Origen is focused on mission, whereas Philo is focused on tradition and the conviction that God guides his people. (GS) 203125. H. Tirosh-Samuelson, Happiness in Premodern Judaism: Virtue, Knowledge, and Well-Being, Monographs of the Hebrew Union College  (Cincinnati ), esp. –. The author commences this extensive monograph on happiness in pre-mod- ern Judaism by arguing that it is wrong to think that the question of happiness is not relevant to Jewish religion. She believes that through the ages Jews have been deeply convinced that their tradition was the best path to a happy life and thus secured their happiness.There is thus no irreconcilable conflict between Judaism and the tradition of Aristotelian ethics in which happiness plays such a crucial role. The absorption of Aristotelian ethics by the Jewish tradition in fact begins with Philo. She begins her section on Philo by citing with approval Wolfson’s claim that medieval Jewish philosophy is a continuation of Philonic thought. Philo agrees with the Greek philosophers that only a life lived in accordance with reason will lead to human happiness. She then delineates Philo’s views by first examining his views on God, the Logos and the nature of the human being. God is the origin of human happiness. Humans have been created in such a way that in order to attain the ultimate end of human life they must devote themselves to virtue. A long section follows on Philo’s views on the virtues, which departs from the views of his Greek teachers in placing a strong emphasis on religious and social virtues. The Laws instituted by Moses are an aid to human beings because he could use audio-visual aids to convey his conceptual message. But the main task of the educated reader is to penetrate to the deepermeaning of the Law through allegorical interpretation. The final part of the section discusses the goal of happiness for Philo as ‘being loved by God,’ which is a relational concept. The zenith of happiness is thus reached in an individual, ecstatic, unmediated coming to know the transcendent God. It is not clear, however, whether such a mystical state can be attained in this life. Certainly, however, theTherapeutae are the people who in Philo’s view are able to attain the happiest way of life. (DTR) 203126. P. J.

Wiedemann andK.Dowden (edd.), Sleep, NottinghamClassical Studies  (Bari ) –. The author seeks to find the text in Genesis that Philo commented on in the lost treatise of Somn. In a well documented analysis she proposes to consider Gen : as the object of the commentary of the lost treatise. In this, first of the original trilogy on dreams, the Patriarch Isaac would represent the figure of a man wise by nature, who attains the vita contemplativa. Isaac needs neither learning nor exercise, the particular traits of Abraham and Jacob (= extant Somn. ). He also does not belong to the sensible world of the politician as Joseph does (= extant Somn. ).The author acknowledges a possible objection for this thesis: Gen : is not a dream. But for Philo :κστασις, i.e. direct encounter with God, belongs to the typology of dreams. (JPM) 203128. K. J. Torjesen, ‘The Alexandrian Tradition of the Inspired Interpreter,’ in L. Perrone (ed.), Origeniana Octava. Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Bibliotheca EphemeridumTheologicarum Lova- niensium  (Leuven ) –. The author focuses on the cultural identity and role of the interpreter in the Alexandrian tradition, and aims to demonstrate that the Alexandrian notion of the interpreter unites the roles of prophet, teacher and exegete. Speaking about Philo she discussesMos. .– where he distinguishes three types of oracles to be found in the Holy Scriptures: the three types regard different levels of inspiration of the prophet (who as the recipient of revelation can be passive or active to various degrees). In her discussion Torjesen refers to the solutions of Esther Starobinski-Safran, John Levison and David Winston for the difficulties raised by Philo’s view on prophecy and inspiration. She concludes that in the case of Philo the accent falls on the interpreter as prophet: there is a parallel (noted by Levison) between the way Philo presents Moses as prophetic interpreter of the divine will and the way Philo sees himself as prophetic exegete of the Mosaic Law. Origen too sees the interpreter functioning as a prophet, but he identifies prophesying with correct biblical exegesis, so that in his case the accent falls on the interpreter as teacher.

This thesis examines the theology of the New Testament Gospels, especially that inherent within the parables of Jesus, in light of the soul-based theology of Plato and his followers. It is shown that Jesus’ notion of the Kingdom of God is consistent with Greek philosophy, and is not incompatible with an allegorical notion of Jewish salvation history.The theology of Plato is reconstructed and fol- lowed through the Middle Platonic Jewish scholars in Alexandria; in particular, to Philo, and on to Hellenistic Jews in Galilee. The gospel as preached by Jesus can be interpreted using Platonic, as modified by Philonic, theology to under- stand the Kingdom of God. The interpretation of the New Testament Kingdom of God as being the kingdom of the lovers of wisdom, the philosophers, who emphasize the nourishment of individual human souls by the practice of virtue and the seeking of divine knowledge, is shown to be valid. An exegesis of the Kingdom parables using Hellenistic philosophical doctrine is included. (DTR; based on DAI-A –, p. ) 203132. G.

The monograph surveys the ways in which Jews and Christians in antiquity viewed the Sabbath, focusing especially on the religious concerns of the texts which he examines.

Weiss concludes (p. ): ‘Philo does not argue the Sabbath. On the basis of the Sabbath he argues for the Jew’s love of wisdom, peace, revelation, prophecy, etc. Philo’s elaboration of the nature of the number seven makes clear that he thinks comprehension is not dependent on ecstatic experience but is within the realm of reason. Thus, while in essence it belongs to the uncreated world, as part of the created world the Sabbath makes possible the contemplative life and fosters peace, freedom, equality, faith, and hope.’ (DTR) 203134. J. Whitlark, ‘Enabling Charis: Transformation of the Con- vention of Reciprocity by Philo and in Ephesians,’ Perspectives in Religious Studies  () –. With an interest in how the first-century audience of the letter to the Eph- esians would have understood 1 ρις, Whitlark surveys understandings of the term in classical Greek literature and religion, Greco-Roman benefaction, Philo, and Ephesians itself. Classical Greek literature and Greco-Roman benefaction are marked by the convention of reciprocity among humans and—in Greek lit- erature and religion—between humans and gods. Bestowal of 1 ρις, which was oftenmerited, led to indebtedness, and the recipient’s gratitude would eventually bring about some kind of reciprocation; lack of reciprocity would incur retribu- tion and dissolve relationships. Augustus was ‘the chief patron and benefactor of the Roman Empire’ and his reign was largely supported through the system of benefaction or patronage (p. ). Covenantal nomism and a synergistic semi- Pelagianism are two salvational systems based on reciprocity between God and humans. In contrast to all these understandings, Philo’s notion of 1 ρις is not based on reciprocity. According to him, God freely gives the universe to all peo- ple and virtues to only some; God further enables these latter individuals to maintain a life of virtue. Similarly in Ephesians 1 ρις is not based upon reci- procity between God and the saints. Instead God gives them 1 ρις ‘both ‘to get in’ and ‘to stay in’ the eschatologically saved community’ (p. ). (EB) 203135. J. M.

Busse (ed.), Der Gott Israels im Zeugnis des Neuen Testaments, Quaestiones Disputatae  (Freiburg–Basel–Wien ) –. The starting point for this thematic study is the history of philosophy. Philo depends on Aristotle and the Stoa. In his view the theological vision of God is possible for everyone. To this extent the monotheistic faith of the Jews is a possibility for the non-Jews too (Virt. ). This means that the idea of God is sown in all people, but some special persons such as Moses can look at God in their own light (see Leg. .,Det. –). The proper knowledge of God comes through abstraction. But Philo needs to transform the literal sense in terms of the fundamental sense, e.g. in the themes of God’s regret or anger inDeus –, –. At first sight Philo’s approach seems to bypass the historical role of Israel. But in other texts (especially in the treatises on the Pentateuch) the importance of Israel and the role of the covenant is emphasized.The Jewish people are in this sense the first fruits of the whole of humanity offered to God (see Spec. .). Finally some modern theological questions are raised. (GS) </page> <page sequence="261">  . F. Alesse, ‘Il luogo del nous: alcuni aspetti dell’antropologia di Filone di Alessandria,’ in A.

Only the intellect in the human being carries the divine stamp, and for this reason, even though it is imprisoned in the body it is not a victim of the fall that afflicts the soul. This fact determines the consistent novelty with which Philo conceives the human being in a tripartite form (and not bipartite as the Greek philosophy teaches, even if he does not abandon this position entirely), i.e. body, soul, intellect. For the last-mentioned component the term nous is used, but sometimes also the term πνεupsilontildeμα. This tripartite anthropology is also present in the philosophy of the st and nd century c.e., and especially in Plutarch, for whom the analogies with Gig.  in the author’s view are particularly evident. A specifically Philonic treatment of the role and place of the nous is found in Leg. .ff., of which the psychological doctrine finds a projection in narrative form in the figures ofMoses, Aaron andPharaoh. Certainly the identification ofAaron with the irrational soul is coloured by the notion of the λ γ ς πρ   ρικ ς (cf. Migr. , Det. ), a kind of subordinate logos, which can also be the source of deception (as in Ebr. ), even if it is linked to the δι ν ια. (RR) 20402. M.

The philosophical thought of Philo conflates the notion of time as unlimited and eternal (theGreekway of thinking about time) and the doctrine of revelation (Hebrew thinking). He is indubitably in debt to Plato’s Timaeus when the philosopher affirms that time was created in order for the world to be the mobile image of eternity, but also to the broad tradition on the ‘hebdomad’ when expounding the biblical seven days of the creation of the world.

Philo of Alexandria and Paul of Tarsus are the two most outstanding repre- sentatives of Hellenistic-Judaic universalism. This universalism can be enclosed in the wider frame of the koiné, whose central characteristic is ecumenism. Two trends work together for the development of Philo’s and Paul’s universalism: the Hellenic contribution (essentially Stoicism) and the Hebrew one (particularly that coming from the sapiential tradition). In the centre of his thought Philo places the idea inherited from sapiential Judaism according to which the Torah is Law of nature, without however abandoning the concept of observance. In Paul’s case what impels his universalism is his interpretation of Christianity. (JPM) 20405. F. Avemarie, ‘Juden vor den Richterstühlen Roms.

It is inter- esting to observe that the term used, !Ι υδα( ς, characterizes rather different persons and positions. Occasionally Acts shows a kind of anti-Judaism but with many fewer consequences than in the anti-Judaic conflicts in Alexandria. In contrast to Philo Luke pictures the representatives of the Roman power rather realistically, one could say as involved in quite ‘mundane’ everyday occurrences. This is connected with a reduced emphasis on their religious positions and their administration. All in all Luke grants the Roman officials only a supporting role. (GS) 20406. C.

The author observes that it has long been scholarly practice to link up virtually automatically the terms ‘Essenes’ and ‘pacifists’ and that even after the publication of the Qumran manuscripts scholars defend a pacifism that is an essential feature of the Essenes. Recent research on Qumran has started to distance itself from this theory of ‘Essene pacifism’, but this rejection is taking place without debate or critical argument. In this historiographical study the author analyses the ancient sources on which the theory is based: Philo (Prob. –; Contempl.) and Flavius Josephus. From this analysis it emerges </page> <page sequence="263"> critical studies   that the thesis is based on successive assimilations of the Essenes to the Thera- peutae, and then to the Pythagoreans.

Contrary to the argument in Engberg-Pedersen’s  article (see above ) that Philo’s Contempl.is a fictional account of the ideal society, Philo’s pre- sentation points to the historical reality of the Egyptian-Jewish contemplatives. This article shows how Philo’s description of the Therapeutae resembles Hel- lenistic utopian conventions, particularly Iambulus’ account of the Islands of the Sun (Diodorus Siculus .–). The differences between the Heliopolitans and theTherapeutae are due to realization that the latter are an actual community of ascetics known to Philo (Contempl. ). (KAF) 20408. R.

In this monograph on the doctrine of  8κε ωσις in the Stoa, the author examines as a source Philo’s Anim., in which Philo investigates the question whether animals have reason or not.

This view is refuted by Bees, who concludes that thework cannot be regarded as having been influenced by Posidonius. (ACG) 20409. K.

The study analyzes how humanism was conceived of in different philosophi- cal schools during the Hellenistic and early Roman period, and how these ideas were debated in ancient Jewish thought. The term humanism (‘l’ humanité’) refers to the idea that every person has duties towards his/her fellow human beings, for the sole reason that they all share a common nature or are bound by a form of kinship. The book also tries to determine to what extent Gen :– (creation of human beings in God’s image) and Lev : (the com- mandment to love one’s neighbour, who is like oneself) could be interpreted in a humanistic way by ancient Jewish writers. Two sections of the book are specifically devoted to Philo’s thought on the question. It is too simple to say that Philo explicates Jewish ethical ideas by means of Greek philosophical lan- guage. Often he subverts these concepts and gives them an entirely different connotation. In particular the author examines the concepts of κ ινων α,  8- κε ωσις, συγγ νεια and  μ  ωσις, with particular emphasis on the exegesis of </page> <page sequence="264">  part two crucial texts such as Gen :–, :, :. The analysis includes a discussion of Philo’s attitude to slavery, esp. in the light of his encomium of the Essenes. It emerges that his views are marked by a strong loyalty to Scripture, which even leads him to subvert his own views.The intimate connection between obedience to the Law and moral excellence ( ρετ ) has as a consequence that humanism as understood by Philo cannot include solidarity with the wicked. The univer- salism of Philo’s ideas remains very limited, esp. since his understanding of the creation of the human being ‘according to the image’ is interpreted above all in terms of the relation between human beings and God (and not so much in terms of inter-human relations).

Harris and G. Ruffini (edd.), Ancient Alexandria between Egypt andGreece, Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition  (Leiden ) –. Through their portrayals of wise and virtuous people, the Letter of Aristeas, the Wisdom of Solomon, and the writings of Philo reflect Jews’ perceptions of themselves and others. The Letter of Aristeas takes a dual stance in sometimes viewing Jews and non-Jews as equally wise and virtuous and sometimes seeing Jews as superior to non-Jews. Based on the latter stance, Birnbaum suggests that the work may be ‘a Jewish Diaspora fantasy’ intended chiefly to bolster Jews’ confidence but perhaps also to impress non-Jews (p. ). In the Wisdom of Solomon (whose provenance is debated), the wise and virtuous are identified completely with the Jews and their ancestors, non-Jews are ignorant of God, and relations between the two groups are only hostile. Recognizing wise and virtuous people among both Jews and non-Jews, Philo sometimes appears to view Jews and non-Jews as equals. At other times, however, he sees Jewish wise and virtuous figures as superior to non-Jewish ones and sometimes claims that the entire Jewish nation surpasses all others. Despite such claims, Philo also distinguishes among different kinds of Jews, such as literal and allegorical biblical exegetes. Philo never includes his Alexandrian contemporaries among the non-Jewish wise and virtuous, who instead seem to be ideal figures of long ago and/or far away. The author suggests that while Philo could ideally accept the equality of Jews and non-Jews, the turbulence of current events may have led him to present the Jews as superior to everyone else.

To illuminate this role, Birnbaum </page> <page sequence="265"> critical studies   reviews the political situation in st century Alexandria and discusses Philo’s life, character, works, intended audiences, and ideas. Philo’s ideas about God, virtue, and the Jews constitute the vision which informed his teachings. Cen- tral to the imagining of Philo as a leader is an understanding of his differ- ent intended audiences because these audiences may indicate whom he influ- enced or wished to influence. The section entitled ‘Philo’s Messages to Differ- ent Groups’ presents Philonic teachings that might have been directed toward a mixed group of Jews and non-Jews, Jews alone, the Alexandrian Jewish com- munity specifically, and Philo’s own inner circle of like-minded Jews. In dis- cussing Moses, Joseph, and Pharaoh, Philo reflects the leadership qualities that he did and did not value. Although he wished to reach a broad audience, Philo was probably most influential with the philosophically sophisticated Jews in his own circle, and his works were neglected by later Jews for centuries. Nonethe- less his writings reveal his pride in and commitment to the entire Jewish nation. (EB) 20412. M.

It is surprising to learn (p. ) that the ‘quaint interpretation of Adam’s love for Eve’ in Leg. . is ‘the first appearance since the Lyceum of the characteristic Aris- totelian contrast between energeia and dunamis.’ Philo’s chief contribution is to interpret the 'ν ργεια of God in terms of his activity and not his actuality (as in Aristotle). He only makes the distinction between God’s ousia and his energeia in one passage, but in a larger sense this contrast runs throughout his statements on human knowledge of God.

Attempts to identify a systematic thought process in the two authors, starting out from the identification of lines of dependency, do not always seem to give convincing results or be solidly grounded.The investigative approach that seems to be most convincing consists in giving priority to the biblical texts that both authors comment on, and using these texts as a concrete guideline for a series of </page> <page sequence="267"> critical studies   parallel findings in the corpus of the two Alexandrian authors.

The paper gives a general presentation of how Philo treats sacrifices. On the one hand he emphasizes their importance in literal terms as elements of cultic observance in accordance with Levitical norms. On the other he interprets them allegorically as symbols. They are endowed with meaning which exceeds the simple acts involved: they have reference to the monad, to the cosmos, to the excellence of moderation. Sacrifices can thus refer to divine greatness, to the perfection of his creation, and to excellencewhich human beings should acquire. They thus constitute signs, messages and linguistic elements, expressing a reality in a non-verbal language and concealing a meaning that is different to what appears on the surface. Allegorical interpretation of sacrifices enables them to be seen as tools both for understanding truth and for obtaining knowledge of reality. (DTR) 20418. F.

This article, concentrating on the treatise Decal., maintains that for Philo the Decalogue is not so much a set of ethical rules, but rather an ontological and political foundation, as well as a self-revelation of God. The individual is set in a broader context which transcends his individuality. Obviously, the commandments are formulated in the second person singular in order that each person should feel directly and personally involved, but the message is directed at the people as a whole: the transmission of the law makes sense in the sphere of interaction between human beings, between human beings and God, and between human law and natural law. It is no coincidence that this communication was made by God directly to all the people together and that it happened in the desert far away from the city, in the midst of miracles. The revelation of the law thus appears to be much more a self-revelation of God and a political foundation than the construction of a set of individual ethics, </page> <page sequence="268">  part two an element which is practically absent. The attention given to the self-revelatory aspects of God present in the Decalogue is almost inextricably interwoven with its being natural law.However, this does not lessen the importance of compliance with the special laws for which the ten commandments provide the basic and more general principles.

The article discusses Philo’s thinking, characterized by his grafting Platonist- Aristotelian thought on the biblical tradition, as a decisive moment in the trans- formation of classical ontology into theology. Philo deals with the themes of causality of the first principle and the Ideas as thoughts of God, hence with the problems of unity and plurality of the first principle, transcendence and imma- nence, and the modes of action, knowability, describability and nameability of God. Calabi’s hypothesis is that Philo tries to overcome the philosophical diffi- culties by introducing a distinction between points of view; she observes a con- tinuous oscillation in Philo’s work between, on the one hand, the presentation of the Powers and the Logos as modes of action of God or even as autonomous entities, and on the other hand, their presentation as human forms of knowl- edge, modes of approaching the first principle. Philo realizes a sort of dou- bling effect by distinguishing between Ideas within the mind (Logos) of God and Ideas which thanks to their creation have obtained an existence outside it. Do we have here two separate levels of being, or rather two different ways of looking at the same thing? The author opts for the latter vision, with refer- ence to and discussion of many Philonic passages (e.g. from Opif. and Mut.). (HMK) 20420. F. Calabi, ‘Ruoli e figure di mediazione in Filone di Alessan- dria,’ Adamantius  () –. The author discusses the question of a demonology in Philo: whether in Philo there are mediating beings between God and man. Her answer is that rather than speak of mediators, one may speak of roles of mediation in Philo, per- formed by created beings, viz. angels, who are souls (living in the air) charged with specific functions. The central text is Gig. –. Calabi holds that for Philo, souls, demons and angels are different names for the same beings, depend- ing on the different choices made by them. The mediating role of angels is in answer to a need of mankind for help, consolation, revelation, and pun- ishment. Calabi also discusses Opif. –, interpretation of the plural ‘let us make human beings’ in Gen :. Philo here ascribes a specific role in the work of creation to angels, viz. the creation of the human being’s imperfect part (open for evil), as distinct from the general role in the work of creation, ascribed to the Powers, viz. the creation of the (imperfect) world as a whole.

This monograph is a revised version of the author’s dissertation (Sheffield ; see RRS ). Its thesis is that the traditions of Abraham’s rejection of idolatry and embracing of monotheistic faith are very significant for an understanding of Paul’s argument in his letters to the Galatians and the Romans, and the debates in the communities to which he writes. Excluding the rabbinic texts, Calvert-Koyzis focuses on Jubilees, the works of Philo, the Ps.Philonic LAB, Josephus’ Antiquities, and the Apocalypse of Abraham. Then she turns to the Letter to the Galatians and the Letter to the Romans. Concerning Philo, after having sketched the main tenets of his life and work, the author deals with the interpretation of Abraham in the works of Philo.

Philo plays an important role in this monograph devoted to the reception of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in Gen  (together with the outrage at Gibeah in Judg –) in Jewish and Christian traditions up to the Reforma- tion. Philo is the exception to the general trend of Jewish exegesis to read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in terms of injustice, lawlessness and hostility to outsiders.The author in fact considers ‘Philo to be the inventor of the homopho- bic reading of Genesis ’ (p. ). This conclusion is based on an examination of Philonic texts, particularly Abr., which provide a theological grounding not only for homophobia but also for genocide. Examination of Philo’s allegories, however, show that his interpretation of male and female roles leads to contra- dictions. Attention is also given to the interpretation of Lot and his family in QG. Carden notes that Origen appears to know Philo’s reading of the Sodom story (p. ).

After discussing the limitations of our sources, the author turns to how Jews and Christians responded to their Alexandrian environment. Although some Jews like the author of the Letter of Aristeas and Philo appear to have felt quite at home in the city, it was also important to them to maintain a distinctive </page> <page sequence="270">  part two identity, central to which was the Greek translation of the Bible. Both writers emphasize the openness of Jewish culture to the outside world and the com- patibility of Jewish and Greek intellectual traditions. Jewish sources sometimes reflect the influence of contemporary Greek philosophers and exegetes, but we have little evidence of who these figures were. Despite signs that Jews felt at home in Alexandria, Philo also reveals a sense of alienation from the culture, especially when he discusses proselytes, aspects of Alexandrian life, and the violent upris- ing against the Jews. Other Jewish works too suggest that not all Jews felt at home in Alexandria and some pagan writers express hostility toward the Jews. Alexan- drian Christians maintained continuities with earlier Jews through their shared Greek Bible, biblical exegesis, and interactions with Greek intellectual tradition. Nonetheless Christians rejected Jewish practices and focused on a broader range of biblical books. Despite impressions of cultural interaction and openness, both Jewish and Christian sources convey a sense of hostility in Alexandria between Jews and pagans, Christians and pagans, and later Jews and Christians.

The article gives a preliminary analysis of Philo’s mystery terminology, con- centrating primarily on the term μυστ ρι ν and related words. First a number of unspecific usages are examined, including those which refer to the knowledge of God and the Torah as ‘mysteries’.Then a larger group of passages are analyzed in which ‘mystery terminology’ is used in the context of philosophical allegoriza- tion of the biblical text, including those in which reference ismade to the process of (attempting) to gain knowledge of God. The author concludes that there can be no question of any kind of ‘mystery religion’. Philo uses this kind of terminol- ogy metaphorically. He does not have in mind any kind of secret esoteric lore, but he is keen to avoid criticism from fundamentalist–literalists. For him the ‘Great Jewish Mysteries’ are God’s absolute unity and incorporeality, combining Judaism and Platonism. The article concludes with some remarks on what can be said about Philo’s ‘mystical experience’. (DTR) 20425. F. Conti Bizzarro, ‘Nell’officina di Polluce,’ in G. Abba- monte, F.

Scholars disagree about whether the background of Heb :– should be understood as the high priest’s entry into the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement or as part of the inauguration of the entire sanctuary. The dispute rests upon whether τG Wγια in Heb : refers to the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary or to the sanctuary in general. To illuminate the Hebrews usage, Cosaert examines how Wγι ς is used in extra-biblical Greek Jewish literature— namely, the Sibylline Oracles, Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Psalms of Solomon, Philo, and Josephus. He concludes that when used alone, τG Wγια in this literature refers only to the entire sanctuary and never just to the Holy of Holies. The background of the Hebrews passage would therefore seem to be the inauguration of the whole sanctuary. The evidence of Philo supports Cosaert’s conclusion: to refer to theMostHoly Place in the sanctuary Philo uses 'ν  δupsilonacuteτ ις or τG Wγια τ=ν Xγ ων. (EB) 20427. N.

This contribution studies the senses of the term λ γ ς in Philo, with refer- ences to its antecedents and their influence. The result of the combination of hellenistic and Biblical traditions is not without originality. One of the most cre- ative ideas is the convergences of the divine Logos, the foundation of creation, and the writings of Moses.Through the path of the Torah one can obtain knowl- edge of the world and the Logos, and then reach true knowledge of God, which is always dependent on the grace and self-revelation of the same God.

The author briefly discusses texts and scholarly interpretations of the idea of the divine logos according to Philo. It contains elements of Platonic and Stoic traditions in addition to the Biblical perspective of the word as creative power. The logos is the mediator between the eternity of God the creator and the perpetuity of his creative work, an idea which reappears in Christian and Neoplatonist philosophers.

Internationales Symposium zum Corpus Judaeo-HellenisticumNovi Testamenti (Eisenach/Jena, Mai ), Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament  (Tübin- gen ). The book records the proceedings of the first conference held in Germany to be devoted largely to the thought of Philo. It was organized as the First International Symposium of the Corpus Judaeo-Hellenisticum Novi Testamenti project under the leadership of the two editors of the volume. In a valuable introductory section entitled ‘Philo und das Neue Testament—Das Neue Testa- ment und Philo. Wechselseitige Wahrnehmungen,’ the editors outline the aims of the project and the conference, and also give a valuable overview of Philo’s importance for theChristian tradition, including interesting remarks on Luther’s knowledge of Philo and on the extensive use of Philo made by Hugo Grotius. The programme of the actual conference as represented in its proceedings falls into four parts: (a) three papers surveying the field of Philo and the New Tes- tament; (b) twelve articles presented in six pairs, with a Philonist and a New Testament scholar looking at a common theme from the viewpoint of their own specialization; (c) two further articles on separate subjects; and (d) three detailed readings of Philonic texts, the results of workshops held at the conference. Every effort was made to ensure that the scholarly conversation was reciprocal and bi- directional in its approach. The papers are summarized under the heading of their authors in the present bibliography. Reviews: L. Doering, JSNT  () ; C. Grappe, RHPhR  () –; T.

In this revised second edition of his  Chicago dissertation the author argues against the view that Paul should be seen as the founding father of Chris- tian asceticism. Rather the discussion between him and the Corinthians should be seen against the background of the Stoic–Cynic debate about the advantages and disadvantages of marriage. In the lengthy second chapter Deming gives a detailed account of this debate as it emerges in a rich array of sources. One of these is Philo. In a brief survey those texts are emphasized in which the influ- ence of Stoicmarriage discussions can be discerned.However, there are also texts which reveal Cynic motifs, for example in his depictions of the model philoso- phers, the Essenes and the Therapeutae. Philo is thus able to accommodate a number of differing points of view. But in his various pronouncements on the desirability of contributing to the civic obligations of the community and trying to escape them, he verges on inconsistency.

This compact but detailed introduction addresses the complex issue of what the Septuagint (LXX) comprises, and includes chapters on descriptions of its origins in the Letter of Aristeas and Aristobulus; questions about its dating, location, and purpose; accounts of the Septuagint in Philo, Josephus, rabbinic sources, and various Christian sources; later Jewish and Christian texts of the Greek Bible; language and style of the LXX; interpretive uses of the LXX in Jewish and Christian sources, including a brief comparison of the LXX and the Masoretic text; and modern scholarly approaches to the LXX. Philo is discussed for his account of the origins of the LXX (pp. –) and his interpretive use of it (pp. –). With his suggestion that the translators were divinely possessed and his claim that they each separately arrived at the identical translation, Philo is the first to emphasize the miraculous and supernatural character of the LXX. He also offers ‘the first sustained interpretation of the LXX’ (p. ) and considers theGreek Pentateuch (and probably the rest of theGreekBible) to have equal authority to the Hebrew original.

The author commences by setting out the basic meaning of καιρ ς, the fixed moment, the given or the right time, and of λ γ ς, the word or reason.

This study deals with the question of how the total elimination of the Amale- kites (Deut :, Sam :) is interpreted by Philo, Ps.Philo and Josephus.The exegesis of the elimination of other groups—with or without God’s command— is also discussed: the perishing of all animals and human beings in the flood </page> <page sequence="274">  part two (Gen ), the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen :–:), the murder of the Egyptian first-born (Exod :), the extermination of the seven nations of Canaan (Deut :–), the revenge taken by Simeon and Levi for the rape of Dinah (Gen ), the annihilation of the nations of Sihon and Og (Num :–), the complete destruction of the people in Jericho (Josh :), the extermination of the priests ofNob (Sam:–), andPhinehas’ zealotry (Num :–). These stories raise questions of divine morality. Philo finds solutions in allegorical exegesis, regarding the struggle between the Israelites and the Amalekites as one between passion and mind. The revenge on the Hivites by Simeon and Levi is also interpreted allegorically. In other cases he argues that wicked people deserve punishment (the Flood, Sodom, the Egyptian first-born). Philo nowhere refers to God’s command to exterminate the nation of Canaan or the extermination of the priests of Nob.He also does not deal with the episode of the destruction of Jericho. He deals extensively with the story of Phinehas, and although Phinehas committed an illegal action, he is praised overwhelmingly by Philo. Comparing Philo, Ps.Philo and Josephus, Feldman concludes that Philo ‘adamantly defends the principle that the innocent should not suffer for the sins of the guilty. He is likewise concerned with maintaining good relations with the non-Jews, and so he must answer those who charge the Jews with hating non- Jews’ (p. ). He has also to be careful to justify the actions of God and of the Israelites. Reviews: M. Barker, JSOT  () –; S. Bowman, AJSR  () –; B. N. Fisk, JJS  () –; L. L.

In his treatment of the story of the revenge meted out by Simeon and Levi for the rape of their sister Dinah (Gen ), Philo offers an allegorical exegesis, explaining Shechem as a symbol of toil and Dinah as a symbol of justice (Migr. –, Mut. –). In this way he avoids the issue of Simeon and Levi’s deceit and guilt. He denigrates Shechem and praises Simeon and Levi. Philo favours conversion of Gentiles to Judaism and he knows about frictions between Jews and non-Jews in Alexandria. Therefore, he ‘would surely have found it impolitic to recall the details of an incident in which Jews demanded conversion and then were guilty of perfidy once it had been agreed to’ (p. ).

Filler stresses that Philo did not recommend abstinence and was thus closer to the rabbis than to certain Greek thinkers. Moreover, the Therapeutae are identified as a group of elderly philosophers, who abstained frommarital life only towards the end of their lives, after establishing a family. Finally, Filler explains Philo’s famous insistence on the separate place of women in the house as an expression of his concern that homosexuality may spread if the essential difference between man and woman is not upheld.

Philo associates the allegorical method with a certain kind of biography, a method which has unusual features. The author compares Abr. and Ios., which are not straightforward accounts of biographical events, but both constitute a bios. These ‘allegorical biographies’ are based on a first kind of basic allegory which extracts from the biblical account a symbolic figure and reconstructs it through a rewriting of the narrative. To this basic task a ‘second allegorization’ is added, involving detail, which is attached to each episode and varies its function from the one treatise to the other. A comparison of the treatises’ structure allows the tensions inherent in Ios. to be observed: the tension between the ideal figure of the politician drawn in the narrative and inspired in particular by Hellenistic theories on good government, and the allegorical commentaries, which emphasize the difficulties and the relative worth of the political world, a tension which also arises between the figure-symbol and the biblical patriarch whose destiny is part of God’s purpose.

In this monograph based on a  Emory dissertation (on which see ) the author includes a chapter on ‘Freedom in the Works of Philo’. Philo is seen as continuously engaging the Cynic–Stoic tradition by means of his allegorical method. Against the background of the philosophical discussion, the theocen- tric character of freedom is emphasized. The mind, after being liberated from the tyranny of passion and wrongdoings, has God for its master. Regarding wealth Philo does not value the Cynic’s call to a life of renunciation. Although Prob.reflects strong agreement with Stoic teachings, it also reflects Philo’s overar- ching concern that the vision of God must be the goal of the person who is free. </page> <page sequence="276">  part two Such a person is no longer called God’s slave, but rather his friend. The chapter ends with observations on the realization of such freedom in community life, notably in the communities of the Therapeutae and the Essenes. Philo’s views draw heavily on his own social location as a wealthy male of some eminence in a patriarchal society. (DTR; partly based on a summary provided by D. Zeller) 20438. R. Goldenberg, ‘Religious Formation in Ancient Judaism,’ in J. vanEngen (ed.), Educating People of Faith (GrandRapids ) –. In a book devoted to understanding the education of people of faith, Gold- enberg considers Philo, the Qumran community, and early rabbinic texts in order to discern their ultimate goals of religious education, ways the goals were achieved, the role of others in helping to achieve the goals, and implied ideas about the sources themselves based on their notions of these goals. Philo’s ulti- mate goal was the ecstatic state of ‘sober intoxication,’ attained through obser- vance and deep philosophical understanding of the Mosaic laws. Training for this goal involved Greek and Jewish education. Although Philo felt strong social obligations, he did not indicate the basis of these obligations. ‘The driving force’ of his life would seem to involve educating disciples through writing or personal example. Nevertheless for him the religious quest was essentially solitary. The ultimate goal of the Qumran community was to belong to this community, a goal seen not as an achievement but a divine gift. People joined after they were already educated but membership involved ‘a lifetime of disciplined perfection’ (p. ). In contrast to the relative isolation of Philo and the Qumran commu- nity, the rabbis sought maximum involvement in the community.Their ultimate goal was twofold: for the rabbis themselves, it was to immerse themselves in and transmit learning of Torah; for the community, it was to live in accordance with rabbinic teaching. All three sources reflect elite classes, address literate adults, and virtually ignore the training of children. (EB) 20439. P. Graffigna, ‘Modelli di vita felice.

The question of a good life was amongst the most seriously debated issues in the Greco-Roman period. This article aims to analyze the theme of a good life and happiness in Philo’s works. What emerges is that happiness, whether termed εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α or μακαρι της, is, for Philo, the goal towards which the life of every wise and virtuous human being must aspire. The lives of Abraham, Moses, and the Therapeutae are examples of good lives. The philosophical background here is Stoicism, but also Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. Happiness occupies pride of place in Philo’s ethics, in which God enjoys a perfectly happy and contented life and human beings should strive to be like Him, restore the </page> <page sequence="277"> critical studies   connection of kinship with Him and stand before Him in the same condition of immobility in whichHe himself lives. Happiness thus finds a corresponding ele- ment in stability (εupsilonlenisστ  εια), an important virtue, the model for which is God and which is accurately reflected by the Patriarchs in their lives. The lives of the Patriarchs and theTherapeutae are the true paradigms of a happy life, because in each of them  εραπεupsilonacuteειν, εωρε(ν and εupsilonlenisδαιμ νε(ν are equivalents, in both the Platonic and Aristotelian sense: the genuine  εραπε α, the one directed towards God, leads to the stability of contemplation which, in its turn, brings content- ment in life. For Philo, however, unlike Plato and Aristotle, this is all part and parcel of the practice of the highest virtue, εupsilonlenisσ  εια. Stability (εupsilonlenisστ  εια) thus has a central role in Philo’s ethics and is determined by  π  εια, γαλ νη, ε8- ρ νη, εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α: it defines man’s ideal state, the original perfection which he must strive to attain, and which consists in recognizing one’s own ontologi- cal ‘being for God’: for this reason, those who succeed in being εupsilonlenisστα  ς are necessarily also εupsilonlenisδα μων and εupsilonlenisσε  ς.

Kovelman’s article (see below ) the author argues against his claim that Alexandrian exegesis was a missing link in the evo- lution from biblical epic to rabbinic spoudogeloion, or serio-comical litera- ture. Questioning this characterization of the evolution altogether, the author maintains that ‘the admission of humor’ into the rabbinic corpus reflected an internal change in Jewish literature—but not a change in genre—and that this change came about ‘in dialogue and community with the Greco-Roman’ literatures (p. ). To counter Kovelman’s argument that the Rabbis were influenced by Philo’s treatment, she also discusses rabbinic interpretations of Eve’s creation and rabbinic use of the androgynous human creation myth.

The paper argues that an examination of the spirituality of the Therapeutae can shed significant light on Philo’s rather abstruse exegesis of Gen  and  in terms of a double creation of humanity. The life of the soul that this community practises can be read as a kind of nearly realized eschatology. Although no direct historical link can be established, there are clear parallels between Paul’s affirmations in Cor :– and Philo’s double creation of humanity, just as there are between the Corinthians whom Paul addresses and Philo’s Therapeutae. In both cases praxis and theory shed light on each other. Reading Philo’s treatises helps us understand the kind of spiritual problems that Paul was attempting to address. (DTR) 20444. B.

The heavenly journey proves to be valuable like a traditional linguistic game (‘Sprachspiel’) that was often used from Plato onwards.

In this study the author offers a short sketch of the doctrine of scriptural inspiration as seen in the exegesis of Tim :. Two questions are central: the relationship between the New Testament texts and the writings of Philo on the one hand, and the consequences on the other. Herzer rejects the traditional interpretation of H. Burkhardt that the texts provide evidence for the doctrine of infallibility (esp. Praem. ). In reality the characterization of Moses as Tρμηνεupsilonacuteς shows the concept of a twofold hermeneutics: the prophet Moses as interpreter of the divine word and the hermeneutics of the exegete who is interpreting (allegorically) the scriptural evidence under the powerful influence of the divine spirit. The author concludes that the common view of the theme of ‘Holy Spirit in scriptural inspiration’ as having been taken by the author of the Pastoral epistle from Hellenistic Judaism is unverifiable. It is more likely that Tim has developed his own idea in controversy with his opponents. (GS) 20446. I. Himbaza, Le Décalogue et l’ histoire du text.

When Philo lists the ten commandments, he does not cite the actual text of their contents. In Decal. , however, we find a direct quotation of the th to th commandments. With regard to the two versions of the Decalogue, the question is raised whether Philo follows Exodus or Deuteronomy.

FS Frankemölle (Paderborn ) –. The New Testament scholar Hoppe analyses the term δικαι σupsilonacuteνη against the philosophical horizon of ancient ethical teachings. Already in Plato δικαι σupsilonacuteνη reflects more than the natural order: ultimately it is established in an anthropo- logical/theological sense. Due to a number of texts dealing with God’s δικαι - σupsilonacuteνη the subject is fundamental in the writings of Philo, who emphasizes that it has its origin in God. It is seen as a gift of God to humanity and is connected with the order of the creation and the Torah. It plays an important part in the virtues which are incorporated from the Greek tradition and encourages human beings to be self-sufficient and free of acquisitiveness. This liberates them from the troubles of the world and empowers judgment.The true wiseman represents himself as a doer of justice in his practical experience. Although Matthew and Philo are not directly connected, both show in their use of the term δικαι σupsilonacuteνη the close relationship between the milieus of Judaism in Palestine, Hellenistic Judaism and the world of the first Christians.

The Jewish puppet king Agrippa I plays a role in both the book of Acts and in Flacc., the major difference being that in the work of Luke this king is a  ε μ 1 ς, a persecutor of the earliest Christian community, while in Philo’s work he is the opposite: he intervenes on behalf of the persecuted Jews in Alexandria. It is as if Luke had read Flacc. and reverses the roles. Parallels between Acts and Flacc. further include the matter of names of synagogues (Acts :; Flacc. ); the details of the sea voyages of Agrippa and Flaccus (Flacc. , –) and the one by the apostle Paul (Acts –); the location of synagogues in the vicinity of water (Flacc. ; Acts :) etc. (DTR; based on author’s summary) 20450.

Van der Horst first makes some remarks on the use of the Quaestiones genre in the Jewish–Hellenistic tradition. Philo’s only extant predecessor is Demetrius the Chronographer, who uses the genre to deal with problems in the biblical text. There may have been others, but if so, they have been lost. He then asks whether it is meaningful to compare Philo with the rabbis.The answer is no and yes. There is no rabbinic literature which specifically deals with the biblical text in the manner of Philo’s Quaestiones. But the rabbis did deal with implicit problems in scripture, to which they gave answers, and in this sense it makes sense to compare Philo and the rabbis. Moreover, they share common assumptions in their attitude to the biblical text. Van der Horst explains these by drawing on the work of Kugel in his book Traditions of the Bible (see ). The most important is the assumption of the cryptic nature and hidden meanings of the sacred text. In the final part of the paper five examples of common problems tackled by both Philo and the rabbis are analyzed. The Philonic texts dealt with are QG ., , , –, . In spite of the profound differences in the solutions proposed by Philo and the rabbis, they do have common ground through the fact that they wrestled with the same problems posed by the biblical text. One of the most striking differences is Philo’s use of Greek philosophical themes (e.g. the immortality of the soul). But such divergence, the author concludes, is less weighty than the striking convergence in the nature of the questions asked. (DTR) 20451. L. W.

In the first part of his paperHurtadodealswith the relationship betweenPhilo and New Testament authors and reaches the conclusion that no direct relation- ship is possible. In the second part, referring to recent scholars, especially Peder Borgen and John Barclay, Hurtardo shows how Philo is important for obtain- ing knowledge of Judaism in the Diaspora, the context in which Christianity has emerged. He emphasizes that Philo has to be understood in his own cultural and religious setting. The final part is devoted to two features of early Chris- tianity that are distinctive in comparison with the Roman-era Jewish setting: the programmatic conversion of Gentiles without requiring Torah-observance, and the devotion to Jesus as divine. Hurtardo concludes that in Philo there is no impetus for these features. Philo can explain early Christianity because he tells so much about Graeco-Roman Judaism. Philo displays a commitment to the religious beliefs of his ancestors and is also engaged in his cultural environ- ment. He is in some respects comparable to Paul, but cannot be used to explain the distinctive features of early Christianity. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="282">  part two 20452. S. Inowlocki, ‘The Reception of Philo’s Legatio ad Gaium in Eusebius of Caesarea’s works,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () – . The author examines Eusebius’ use of Philo’s Legat. in the Demonstratio evangelica and in the Historia ecclesiastica. In these works Eusebius refers to Philo’s treatise in three passages: DE . aff., HE .. and HE ... In the first passage Eusebius narrates the sacrilege committed by Pilate, refer- ring to both Philo and Josephus. Inowlocki discusses some problems arising from this passage, especially the discrepancies between the versions of Philo, Josephus, and Eusebius. Although the bishop’s account does not correspond to Philo’s wording in Legat., he does refer to the treatise. Because of his apologetic purpose Eusebius reshapes Philo’s words. In HE .., where Eusebius refers to Philo’s account of Sejanus’ hate for the Jews and Pilate’s misdeeds against them, he paraphrases Philo’s words because the report was too sympathetic to the Jews. In HE .. Eusebius cites Legat.  literally. Inowlocki concludes that Eusebius, by employing several techniques (paraphrasing, summarizing, citing carefully), uses Philo for his own apologetic purposes, and makes the information that the Jewish writer offers subservient to his theological views.

This article deals with Eusebius’ interpretation of the description of the Therapeutae that Philo gives inContempl. Making use of Philo’s report, Eusebius wants to demonstrate that the Therapeutae are the first Christians in Egypt. In his exploitation of Philo’s account he makes use of several techniques; he paraphrases, summarizes and quotes it. This variation is due to his apologetic aim. Eusebius has a high esteem for Philo, who is presented as nearly converted to Christianity. He also reports about a meeting between Philo and Peter in Rome. By demonstrating that theTherapeutae are Christians, Eusebius validates the apostolic authority of the Alexandrian see. At the same time with the aid of Philo he legitimates the catechetical schools in Alexandria and Caesarea, which he implicitly traces back to Peter and Mark. (ACG) 20454. H.

In Somn. .– Philo in discussing God’s immutability notes the old story that the divinity toured the cities in order to examine human wickedness. This is an allusion to Homer Od. ., which Plato firmly rejects in his passage on true theology at Rep. d–d. For Philo, however, it is educationally beneficial and should be exploited.

Kamesar, ‘The Logos Endiathetos and theLogos Prophorikos in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the Iliad,’Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies  () –. Philo offers the earliest extensive evidence of the λ γ ς 'νδι  ετ ς, or ‘inter- nal logos,’ and the λ γ ς πρ   ρικ ς, or ‘uttered logos.’ Most often symbolized in his thought by the brothers Moses (as λ γ ς 'νδι  ετ ς) and Aaron (as λ - γ ς πρ   ρικ ς), this doctrine of the two logoi is generally attributed to the Stoics. Kamesar argues that Philo was influenced not only by the doctrine itself but also by an allegorization found in the D-scholia to the Iliad, Greek sources that explain Homeric phrases and myths but also contain later, more developed exegetical material. In the Homeric interpretation, the two logoi are symbolized by two brothers, Otus and Ephialtes, known as the Aloadae, and one brother is associated with learning, the other with nature. These associations may possibly reflect the widely attested pairing of (or conflict between) rhetoric and philos- ophy. The D-scholia additionally include an interpretation of the brothers, or λ γ ι, as restraining anger, Ares, who is later freed by Hermes, λ γ ς or reason. Kamesar believes that the interpretation of the Aloadae in the D-scholia may be traced to the Stoa of Diogenes of Babylon and his immediate successors or like-minded circles. (EB) 20457. C.

In this comprehensive survey of the entire field of Patristic literature a brief section is devoted to Philo in the chapter on Patristic hermeneutics. Perhaps surprisingly it focuses on Philo’s views on the literal interpretation of the scrip- tural text. The author cites the view of the editors and translators on the French translation series that ‘the literal value of Torah was of such importance for Philo that it induced him to rethink the very notion of allegory’ (p. ). Kan- nengiesser illustrates Philo’s combination of literal and non-literal exegesis with various texts mainly drawn from the Quaestiones. In the case of QE he argues that there is a difference between those texts where he uses the distinction ad litteram and ad mentem, which make use of allegory, and those where he advances beyond the literal by linking it with the contemplation of the cosmos or with ethical evaluations. In these texts he speaks primarily about ‘symbols’. (DTR) </page> <page sequence="284">  part two 20458. E.

This comprehensive investigation ( pages) aims to investigate the under- standing of the otherwise not attested Greek word 'πι upsilonacuteσι ν of the Lord’s prayer and to suggest a new conjecture. The first section is a presentation of the various previous efforts of understanding this term, drawing especially on the literature published in the years –, demonstrating that no single understand- ing has received support from a majority of scholars. In the second section the author sets forth a new hypothesis, suggesting that 'πι upsilonacuteσι ν should be read as 'π  Qupsilonacuteσι ν, probably to be translated as ‘das Brot als Sühnmittel, als Mittel der Unheilsabwehr oder der Befreiung.’ In the third and last section, the author investigates the use of Qupsilonacuteσι ν in works from Homer to the Byzantine period.

Rejecting the literal meaning of aspects of the biblical creation stories, Philo presented his philosophical understanding. The rabbis, however, accepting the literal meaning, ‘went so far as to use it for parody and travesty’ (p. ). The rabbis ‘rejected the seriousness and didactic tone of the Second Temple literature (Rewritten Bible, Alexandrian exegesis), changed the style, while standing on the shoulders of this literature’ (p. ). Kovelman emphasizes that to understand the developments in Jewish </page> <page sequence="285"> critical studies   culture specifically, one must understand general developments in the larger context regarding ‘the style of exposition from one period to another’ (p. ). (EB) 20461. A. Kovelman, ‘Continuity and Change in Hellenistic Jewish Exegesis and in Early Rabbinic Literature,’ Review of Rabbinic Judaism  () –. The transition from biblical to rabbinic literature coincided with the emer- gence of the Greco-Roman novel, a literary revolution that gave rise to ‘serio- comical genres.’ In contrast to epics, these genres lack distance between the past and contemporary reality and they often have their origins in folklore. Rabbinic literature reflects the serio-comical genre and contributes to it. In the rise of this genre, Alexandrian exegesis played a crucial role. Both the Letter of Aristeas and Philo emphasize the solemnity of Mosaic Law, especially through their allegorizations, and criticize writers that render the Law frivolous. Kovel- man suggests that Philo’s allegorization of Eve’s creation (Leg. .) and the cre- ation of man (Opif. , ) expresses criticism not of the literal meaning of the Bible but rather of the Platonic myth of the androgyne, which the rabbis embraced. He notes that ‘in shattering the naiveté of the epic, Alexandrians paved the way for irony and laughter,’ found in rabbinic literature (p. ). The two literatures address similar problems such as the separation of the Jews from other peoples. Unlike Pseudo-Aristeas and Philo, however, who had to grapple seriously with the Stoic idea of the freedom and equality of all humanity, the rabbis did not have to reconcile Jewish Law with philosophy; for them, God’s will behind the separation was sufficient explanation.

Sober drunkenness is the spiritual joy or agitation of the human mind elevated towards God, as represented by Isaac (‘laughter’, Leg. .–) or Hannah (‘grace’, Ebr. –) respectively.

This study deals with the relation between civic rights and participation in the (local) cults in the Greek cities, in Rome and in ancient Judaism: to what extent did a stranger have the rights and obligations to participate in the local cults? How are the ancient religions to be perceived concerning exclusivity and compulsiveness? The author presents a very competent and penetrating analysis of his sources, providing an interesting study of the issues that are relevant for students of Judaism as well as of early Christianity. Diaspora Judaism is dealt with on pp. – and focuses on the Greek cities, while pp. – looks at the organization of Jewish Diaspora communities.

The main thesis of this work is that the admission to local cults was not in general associated with membership in a particular ethnic group. In addition Judaism practised a relative openness towards non-Jews. Hence Judaism was a ‘ganz normale’ religion at that time. (TS) </page> <page sequence="287"> critical studies   20466. G.

For both exegetes Abraham’s journey is a model of the road leading to perfection. Didymus also considers Abraham as an example of the ascent of the soul which is narrated in the Psalms. Although Didymus bases himself on Philo, he does alter the conception of perfection. For Philo, to become perfect is to become wise and to acquire the virtues of the cultured sage. In Didymus the migration aims at the perfection of the Christian ascetic involved in spiritual combat. The Christian exegete uses Philo’s material in ways that are appropriate to his own circle. In addition to Philo, Didymus is also inspired by Jubilees and Origen in his exegesis of Abraham. (ACG) 20468. J.

It is noted that §§– </page> <page sequence="288">  part two differ from what precedes and follows, which suggests it might be an insert.

This article discusses some similarities between the conceptions of the Logos in the writings of Philo and in the Prologue of John. In spite of the different approaches to the idea, both authors refer to the very same text in Gen . Both offer a comparable vision of divine revelation and communication in the beginning of Creation. Both show that the function of the Logos is the true explanation: in Philo the explanation of creation, in John the explanation of the Divine creator. Both unite the deep conviction that the Logos always depends on his Father. Both use the concept of the Logos in the manner of the Wisdom literature. Nevertheless there are strong differences: for example, Philo would never refer to a Logos who becomes flesh. Many more differences emerge in the discussion of points of detail. It could be argued, however, that in the st century a prevalent tradition concerning the exegesis of Gen  exists which makes use of the notion of the Logos in the exegesis of the story of the creation. Greek philosophy, Jewish Wisdom literature and biblical exegesis combine together in the notion of the Logos in a creative way. It allows historical events to be framed by their universal importance.

The author replies to the question posed in the paper’s title by surveying the evidence in the Philonic corpus. Philo lived in Egypt because this was the country chosen by his ancestors as their domicile, where the Law had been translated into Greek so that it could become known to the whole of humanity. According to the author Philo does not espouse any idea of amystical association with the land of Israel which creates an obligation to reside there. He lives in Egypt not because of error but because of flight, for the point of departure is the reality of Egyptian life and the bridge that is sought is the activity of the divine Logos, of which the Law is the concrete expression.

Besides the NT, the author uses other sources, among whom is Philo, whose views on Moses are briefly presented throughout the study. In Mos. Moses is portrayed as king, philosopher, lawgiver, high priest, and prophet. His role as prophet was the foundation ofMoses’ leadership of Israel. Inspired byGod, hewas also the author of the Law. Philo avoids the impression that Moses was divine, but at the same time he presents Moses as being of a different order than other mortals. The saying that Moses is as ‘god’ (Exod :) has to be qualified. Moses’ death is described as a pilgrimage from earth to heaven. (ACG) 20472. W. Loader,The Septuagint, Sexuality and the New Testament. Case studies on the Impact of the LXX on Philo and the New Testament (Grand Rapids ). Philo plays a prominent role in this compact but well-researchedmonograph. Loader’s method is based on the close examination of texts, in the first instance comparing the LXX with its Hebrew original, then analyzing Greek texts in the New Testament, Philo and other Second Temple authors to see how they treat the scriptural text.The case studies examined deal with the areas of male–female relations and sexuality. They are the Decalogue, the creation account in Gen –  (with :– added), and the injunctions on divorce in Deut . In each case Philonic texts are discussed. His interpretation of the Decalogue and esp. the tenth commandment reflects influences from Plato and the Stoics, but it is clear that the LXX is the basis for his exposition. Philo’s use of Gen – is extensive. Loader focuses on those texts that relate to his understanding of sexuality. He follows the LXX in highlighting the hierarchy that exists between male and female. Women are seen as a curse not so much in relation to :, but through their creation in :– and ultimately :. ‘Philo necessarily portrays human beings, but especially women, as flawed by nature, particularly because of their sexuality (p. ).’ As for Deut , Philo’s reading shows a shift of focus away from pollution to morality.

The author calls for a new appreciation of the inconsistencies in Philo’s writings, which cannot be harmonized, but need to be appreciated in light of the changing circumstances in Alexandria. While Philo before the riots was a ‘humanistic,’ cosmopolitan philosopher, he was later forced to withdraw to the Jewish community and to defend his tradition vis-à-vis outsiders. While the author does not offer a chronological analysis of all Philonic writings, he suggests that the Allegorical Commentary must be seen as the clearest expression of his state of mind prior to the riots. Somn., on the other hand, reflects the tension in the city. (MRN) 20475. L. M.

Particular attention is paid to the transposition into Armenian of some key terms in Philo’s exegesis. This involves three different translation processes: usually the translator has a fixed correspondence between a Greek term and its Armenian equivalent; sometimes, however, he uses the same Armenian word to render two different Greek words which need to be distinguished, e.g. 8δ α and εKδ ς; but on other occasions he analyses the Greek term and uses more than one Armenian word to render it. It is particularly the last method that makes the Armenian version of Philo’s text so distinctive. (RR; based on author’s summary) 20477. S.

The language used in the Armenian translation of Leg. should not be consid- ered exclusively in terms of the parameters of the so-called Hellenizing school. The linguistic traits that are present in the translation reveal a dialectical relation consisting of similarities and differences with the classical language. The Arme- nian version of Leg. has to be viewed in the linguistic framework formed by the other Armenian translations of Philo. Elements of contrast between these ver- sions and those attributed to the initial phase of the school of Hellenizing trans- lation which is typified as ‘pre-Hellenizing’ allow some questions to be asked about the relative dating of certainHellenizingwritings.

The author focuses on one of the fundamental problems of Philo’s theological thought. If the work of creation is a manifestation of the divine nature, how can one explain the origin of evil in the world and in history? She does not pose the problem in this explicit way, but this aporia is undoubtedly present in the exegesis of the various figures of the )ν ρωπ ς that emerge in the creation of the human being (the human being fashioned, made according to the image, ‘inbreathed’ by the divine πνεupsilontildeμα). In the view of the author these figures lead to a basic opposition between the celestial and the terrestrial human being. This original duality explains the negativity of history, in which it should be understood that ‘the genesis of historical reality is marked by a prevailing negativity’ (p. ). This viewpoint is also present in the Qumran writings and inHermetic thought. However, the author asks, what is the relation between the negativity of history and the absolute positivity of God? Is it because God revealed himself to humanity that it has become wicked? It is suggested that the meaning of history—above all for Philo in the historical treatises—should be considered in a salvific and eschatological perspective. (RR) 20480. A. M. Mazzanti and F.

The description of desert monastics by ecclesiastical historians of the th, th, and even th centuries—e.g. Eusebius, Rufinus, Sozomen, and Evagrius Scholasticus—stands in a long tradition of writings about others on the periph- ery. Though this tradition can be traced as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh and includes the Bible, Herodotus’ account of northern peoples, and Tacitus’ account </page> <page sequence="293"> critical studies   of the Germani, amore direct influence is Philo’s description of theTherapeutae. A common aim of these pre-Christian writers is to use their depictions of people on the periphery to critique practices and norms of the centre. Philo, for example, contrasts the simplicity of theTherapeutae in dress, diet, sex, and living quarters with the excesses of people in Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Later Christian writers use the same genre of writings about people on the periphery and their social, dietary, sexual, communicational, and physical peculiarities, but with different goals. These goals include presenting ascetic monastic communities as ideals, criticizing heretics through presentation of the orthodox monastic ascetics, and showing howwidely the newChristian faith had spread—even into the peripheral desert.

Taking its cue from Francis Bacon’sNovumOrganum () the paper exam- ines the association of idolatry with erroneous ideas about the natural world in the writings of late-antique Jewish and Christian authors. It focuses on two polemical genres. The first of these is the hexaemeral commentaries composed by Philo, Basil of Caesarea and Augustine. These thinkers used their commen- taries and expositions of the six days of creation in order to revise or refute philo- sophical errors in natural philosophy, making use of various critiques of idol- atry in so doing. In discussing Opif. Miller notes in particular those passages which contain polemic against wrong ways of thinking (notably §§, , ). The second genre is heresiology, initiated by Irenaeus and adapted by Augus- tine to refute Gnostic and Manichaean cosmological myths and disregard for the creation account in Genesis. (DTR) 20483.

The author thinks (see p.  n. ) that in the bibliography on this subject not much has not been said after Schürer and that his observations on an implicit messianism in Philo still command respect.

In discussing Nemesius’ doctrine of the human being as a borderline figure (με  ρι ς), the author states that it is important to take into account the Philonic </page> <page sequence="294">  part two background, which is the decisive source for the conception. She includes in the discussion earlier treatments of this theme by Jaeger and Skard, as well as the more recent study of Runia. Nemesius does not take over the ontological dualismof Philo, but onlywelcomes a radical dualism in the ethical sphere. Some comments are also made on the relation between Philo and Gregory of Nyssa, as it affects our view of Nemesius’ sources (cf. p. ). (DTR) 20485. H. Najman, ‘Early Non-Rabbinic Interpretation,’ in A. Berlin and M. Zvi Brettler (edd.), The Jewish Study Bible (New York ) –. Biblical interpretive works that preceded and differed from rabbinic writ- ings range from ‘self-effacing’ retellings, translations, and commentaries to the self-conscious, highly individualistic works of Philo and Josephus. Retellings like Jubilees and the Genesis Apocryphon address legal and literary issues raised implicitly by the Bible. Translations like the Targums, which may date back to Ezra’s time, also include interpretations that address implicit difficulties. A com- mentary like Pesher Habakkuk distinguishes between Bible and interpretation and claims divine authority for both. Unlike these texts addressed to Jews alone, Philo had to authorizeMosaic Law and Judaism itself for both Jews andnon-Jews in the recently established Roman Empire. He did so by attributing universal significance to creation, the patriarchal narratives, and Mosaic Laws, especially with the help of allegorical interpretation, Plato’s Timaeus, and the concept of the unwritten law of nature. Philo wrote self-consciously in the first person but also recognized other sources of authority, including Moses, behind his inter- pretations. Though Josephus claimed to convey the details of Scripture alone, his writings abound with interpretations that often present Jewish tradition in a morally favorable light. He too wrote in his own voice but also presented himself as a divine messenger. (EB) 20486. M. Neher, Wesen und Wirken der Weisheit in der Sapientia Salomonis, Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die alttestamentlicheWissenschaft  (Berlin ), esp. –. The problem this author tries to solve in this monograph (based on his  Marburg dissertation) is the question of whether in the Sapientia Salomonis there is already an understanding of Wisdom as a hypostasis, or if its per- sonalized descriptions of Wisdom are primarily to be understood as poetic metaphors. On pp. – he focuses on ‘Das Vermittlungsproblem bei Philo’. Here he deals with the intermediate figures in Philo, that is especially the Logos, but also the ‘powers’ (δυν μεις), which in fact are manifestations in the world of the Logos. In trying to describe these more precisely, however, he finds in Philo primarily the use of metaphorical language. On the other hand, Philo also uses language of hypostasis. Hence Philo’s solution of the problem demonstrates that the wisdom in the Wisdom of Solomon is to be understood as a ‘Zwischen- stufe’ on the road to a full hypostasis understanding, a road on which Prov  </page> <page sequence="295"> critical studies   represents a beginning and which reaches its goal in the Jewish-Alexandrian theology of Philo. Hence Wisdom is to be dated before Philo (p. ). (TS) 20487. G. W. E. Nickelsburg, ‘Philo among Greeks, Jews and Chris- tians,’ in R.

The article presents a general introduction to Philo and his writings. Part I describes Philo’s life, his writings, his education, and themanner of his scriptural interpretation. Nickelsburg emphasizes that Philo is a man of two worlds: he studies and interprets the Jewish Bible, but at the same time he is educated as a Greek, and participates in Greek culture. In Part II the author touches briefly on some elements that Philo has in common with other contemporary Jews, and also on some ways in which he is unique, such as his attitude towards Scripture, and his use of allegory. Part III is devoted to Philo’s influence on early Christianity. (ACG) 20488. M. R. Niehoff, ‘Response to Arkady Kovelman,’ Review of Rabbinic Judaism  () –. The author responds to and critiques the article of A. Kovelman summarized above at . In contrast to scholars who either ignore Alexandrian Jewish exegesis or try to harmonize Philo with Palestinian rabbinic exegesis, Kovelman carries on the tradition of J. Freudenthal who contends thatAlexandrian Judaism must be appreciated on its own terms. Niehoff questions, however, Kovelman’s broad association of Bible with epic and rabbinic literature with comic novel. She also believes that he has not fully explained how Pseudo-Aristeas and Philo, ‘the very exegetes who most distanced themselves from everything comic . . . became the harbingers of a more comic approach to Scripture’ (p. ). Philo’s allusions to frivolous writers imply that other Alexandrian exegetes had quite different approaches. Niehoff suggests that these other exegetes may themselves have been ‘the crucial bridge between biblical epic and Talmudic farce’ (ibid.). Philo’s objections were not in fact to the frivolity of the literature but rather to the diminishing of divine power implied in the literal understanding of the Bible. In general Kovelman has introduced stimulating ideas that need stronger supporting evidence and analysis. (EB) 20489. M. R.

In his literal treatment three episodes in the life of Sarah are examined: her sojourn in Pharaoh’s house (Gen ), her decision to offer Hagar to Abraham (Gen ), and the visit of the messengers at Mamre (Gen :– ). In his allegorical treatment, Philo draws freely on existing exegetical and Pythagorean Athena traditions (Ebr. –,Mut. –,Mos. .). (KAF) 20490. C.

Both Philo and Paul are witnesses to the impressive creativity of Hellenistic Judaism. The author tries to show that the two contemporaries are compara- ble with common approaches to problems (‘Problembezügen’) and similar sit- uations (‘Problemlagen’), even though they are living in quite different socio- logical circumstances. The paper’s starting point is a Philonic text at Congr. , where Philo distinguishes between souls who boast in ‘having,’ as comparedwith those who place value on ‘receiving.’ This is compared with three Pauline texts: Cor –; Phil ; Cor :–:. Paul and Philo interact with both the exege- sis of holy texts and their readers. The common element is how they can guide the readers and hearers to a spiritual and sober lifestyle (compare the stylistic device of the Diatribe). The author restricts himself especially to the problem of the antithetical characterization of foolishness and wisdom which is connected to human experience und ethical behaviour and is unfolded in lists of evil deeds and virtues (‘Laster- und Tugendkataloge’).

While there are some similarities concerning the views of suffering in the works of Philo and Peter, the differences are more obvious and even more important. First, concerning Philo: while to Philo suffering can be described as a general condition of being human, there are also two other forms of sufferings; suffering as punishment, and undeserved suffering. These do not come from God; indeed, suffering comes never directly from God. The other suffering is to be fought against: ‘mannhafter Kampf im Leiden ist das Ideal’ (p. ). In Peter, however, there are similar views, but the differences are first </page> <page sequence="297"> critical studies   and foremost evident concerning the undeserved suffering. The community of Peter is suffering: how is this to be understood? One of the differences of view is that the suffering of the Christians according to Peter may be described as coming from God, or at least in accordance with the will of God. Suffering becomes one of the ways of communicating with God, and a mark of belonging to God. This kind of suffering is not, according to the author, to be found in Philo. (TS) 20492. A. PassoniDell’Acqua, ‘Alessandria e la Torah,’Richerche Sto- rico Bibliche  () –. Survey article onAlexandrian Jewish literature from the LXX to Philo, paying particular attention to the conception of the Torah and its practical application as expressed in this literature. Alongside Philo, an important source text for this article is theLetter of Aristeas. InAlexandria for the first time theBible, especially the Torah, is approached as a literary text (canon defined, translated, interpreted, all as in the philological tradition of the Alexandrian Museum and Library). The author touches on the context of the origin of the LXX: the synagogue, Alexandria, the Ptolemies, the close contacts between the diaspora/Alexandria and Jerusalem, the translators coming from Jerusalem, and the work in progress in this period of establishing an official Hebrew text of the Scriptures. She discusses the implications of ‘Torah’ translated as ν μ ς, the central place of the Scriptures in Jewish-Hellenistic literature (translations, re-elaborations), the Torah seen not only as Jewish but rather as universal law, the problems in establishing the place and time of origin of many Jewish-Hellenistic works, and the adaptation of the LXX translation to the Alexandrian environment, so that the LXX can be seen as an interpretation of the biblical text (e.g. through the lexical choices, and the titles given to the Biblical books). The author then focuses on the interpretation of the second commandment (regarding idolatry) in Alexandrian Judaism, among others in Philo. As a conclusion, faithfulness to the Torah turns out to be a leading characteristic of Alexandrian Jewish literature. As for the daily practice in the Egyptian diaspora (forwhich papyri are a good source), Jews appear to be recognizable as such only by their adherence to the Torah (not e.g. by dress or names). In Alexandrian Jewish literature, the Torah functions as a model for life and a source of a living, re-interpretable (not static) tradition. (HMK) 20493. P.

According to the author the doctrine of creation is the ‘coping stone’ for the entire edifice of Philo’s thought. In it the ‘logical and ontological’ relation </page> <page sequence="298">  part two between God the creator and his creation are central. Restricting the scope of his enquiry, Pavone concentrates his analysis on the term τ4 πα ητ ν in Opif. –, where the order of the universe is reduced to the two factors of the active and the passive cause. The term itself can be taken in two different ways: either as ‘pre-existent passive’ or as ‘non-pre-existent’. In the second meaning the account of creation in Opif. would not be incompatible with a form of creatio ex nihilo. The doctrine of the simultaneity of the divine creative process also presses in this direction, aswell as that of its unicity, inwhich theπα ητ ν would fulfil a double role: it would indicate the potentiality for divine creation, and at the same time it would prefigure ‘the final result of the divine activity’, i.e. the cosmos (p. ). These two realities, potential and actual, do not contradict each other, but are ‘the two sides of the same medallion’ (ibid.). (RR) 20494. S.

This essay exploreswhat Philo intended by applying the language of μητρ π - λις (‘mother-city’) and  π ικ α (‘colony’) to the relationship between Jerusalem and Jews. Pearce rejects the assertion, made by Kasher (RR ) and Niehoff (see ), that Diaspora Jews saw Jerusalem as their true homeland and the place to which they owed greatest allegiance. While devotion to the Jerusalem temple was central to Philo, an exegesis of Flacc. and Legat. – against the broader contours of Philo’s thought shows that Philo did not claim the cen- trality of Jerusalem over other homelands and Alexandria in particular. Rather, Philo’s language is influenced by the Greek Bible and his Pentateuch-centric piety. (KAF) 20495. S.

The theme of conference for which this contribution was prepared was the Greek and Christian roots of the Islamic tradition of the ideal and virtuous ruler. The paper focuses on the work that was perhaps the most important influence on early Christian models of ideal rule, Philo’sMos. It commences with some general considerations on how Philo presents Moses, followed by some comments on the work itself and its place in the Philonic corpus. It is argued that the work was most likely originally independent of the Exposition of the Law, but that there is a clear association with the latter series, as indicated by internal cross-references. The remainder of the article consists of a fairly literal translation followed by extensive comments on the following passages:Mos. .– , , –, –, , , –, , , .–.

Pessin, ‘Loss, Presence, and Gabirol’s Desire: Medieval Jew- ish Philosophy and the Possibility of a Feminist Ground,’ inWomen and Gender in Jewish Philosophy (Indianapolis ) –. As far back as the Pythagorean ‘Table of Opposites,’ the feminine principle is seen as the negative counterpart of the masculine. One finds what Pessin calls ‘the feminine-as-loss dynamic’ in such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, Philo, and Maimonides as well as in kabbalistic writings. In contrast to these thinkers, Solomon Ibn Gabirol (d. ) provides grounds for evaluating the feminine in a positive way. Unlike his philosophical predecessors he offers a positive evaluation of matter, usually associated with the feminine, links matter to the divine, and sees the passive stance as the positive erotic desire to be completed, in implicit contrast to the masculine erotic desire for power. To illustrate the subordination of female to male in Philo’s thought, Pessin focuses especially on his allegorization of Adam and Eve in Leg.  and observes that ‘it is not merely subordination or suppression, but the demise of the feminine other that marks the Adamic vitality’ (p. ).

The author aims to show by means of a concrete example the extent to which Philo blends background material fromGreek literature with Jewish theological motifs in a synthesis full of allusions. The example is found in the life of Moses, where he speaks about the role of the shepherd practised by Jethro in Midian. Philo is aware that in his description he has to reach out to awide readership. For this reason he does not use the famous biblical shepherd David as an example, but brings into play the classical background of Xenophon’s Cyropaedia and its tradition. The role of shepherd was treated with disdain by many people in the ancient world, notably in Egypt (cf. Agr. ), although it was favoured in the Platonic tradition. It certainly contrasts with the conception of the divine king such as we find in Hellenistic-Roman ideology, so we may conclude that Philo was clever in exploiting the theme of paideia as it had developed in the Xenophontic tradition.

It focuses on a group of terms belonging to the semantic field of the ‘law’ (ν μ ς,   - μις,  εσμ   and their compounds and derivatives), confining the investiga- tion to those treatises where both original Greek and the Armenian version are available. The various renderings of the Greek terms are listed and com- pared with those in earlier and contemporary Armenian translations, with the aim of determining which factors influenced the translators’ choices. Although they often reflect a practice that developed over time, i.e. a conventional sys- tem of correspondences, the choices appear to be less mechanical than is often thought. In general the translators seem to be aware of the particular connota- tions intended by Philo. The choices made reflect a number of different factors, including the translator’s personal linguistic and hermeneutical sensitivities, but also external influences, such as the contribution of the Greek exegetical tra- dition, earlier literature translated into Armenian, and the context. Many cor- respondences were found when comparing the translation of terms within the corpus, but also differences, which suggests that the Armenian translation of Philo’s works was produced by more than one person.

Eine motivgeschichtliche Studie zur Wettkampfmetaphorik bei Paulus, Herders Biblische Studien  (Freiburg ), esp. –. The author examines Paul’s use of a metaphor which was commonly used at the time of the Ancient Greeks ( γ&lt;ν, contest) and traces its development. ‘Sport and games’ played an exceptional role in the world of the Greeks, which is why the word  γ&lt;ν came to be used in a metaphorical way. It represents the battle of the wise against adversity and for virtue. In this study the main emphasis falls on Paul’s use of this metaphor. But an entire section of the work is also devoted to its background both in Greek and Hellenistic–Jewish literature, including a fairly long section on Philo. The author first notes the difference between his approach, involving the allegorization of the lives of the Patriarchs and that of Greek sources. The role of the  γ&lt;ν can be quite precisely determined in Philo’s schematic ontology in between irrationality and rationality on the one hand, and passion and virtue on the other. It is a struggle to attain piety and well-being (εupsilonlenisδαιμ ν α) by means of moral effort. There follows a discussion of the specific prizes that the spiritual athlete gains, with discussions of the terms 6 λ ν,  ρα ε( ν and στ  αν ς. Finally it is noted that Philo’s metaphor is based on his own experience of sport in daily cultural life. (TS) 204100. R. Radice, ‘Considerazioni sulle origini greche dell’allegoria filoniana,’ in A.

The author traces the origins of Philo’s allegorical method to the Stoic sphere, and more specifically to the distinction between allegory and allegoresis, i.e. between allegory as a practice and systematic allegory, in the form of a science, which in his view can be found in Chrysippus. However, although the early Stoics explained myth in terms of philosophical doctrine, they apparently did not bother to give full credibility to the poets as authors and disseminators of myth. This was the contribution of the Middle Stoa (and especially Posidonius), with their theory of the golden age of humanity and the perfect wisdom of the poets. The third part of the study focuses on the allegorists in both the Stoic and the Peripatetic sphere, and also other exponents who take on certain essen- tial features of allegoresis, such as the systematic use of etymology, the specific aim of apologetics, the attention given to non-Hellenic material and the adop- tion of originally Stoic methods by non-Stoic philosophers. All these elements came together, in different degrees, in Alexandrian Judaism, which developed them in an original manner, particularly in the total identification of philoso- phy with allegoresis. Its distinctive feature is its systematic and comprehensive nature, including doctrines of creation and theology. Because of these features, Jewish-Alexandrian allegory pre-empts much of the exegesis produced by later Christian authors. (RR) 204101. I. Ramelli, G. Lucchetta and R. Radice, Allegoria.

The method of systematic allegory expressed by Chrysippus in SVF . finds echoes in Philo, which demonstrates a line of continuity between the two authors. At the same time there are significant differences, which can be traced back to the fact that the Bible is conceived as an organic text of philosophical wisdom.Thismeans that Philonic allegory can bemore systematic and more complete, but less dependent on etymology. Above all it is able to be innovative from the philosophical viewpoint, which distinguishes it from classical Greek allegory that is limited to the confirmation of already existing doctrines.

This thesis demonstrates that Philo of Alexandria and Paul of Tarsus make significant use of the Stoic paradoxes, which are a set of ethical beliefs that go against common opinion (Cicero, Para. Stoic.). It shows that Philo employs the philosophy and philology of the paradoxes in his biblical exegesis and that Paul relies upon philosophical assumptions similar to those of the paradoxes. Although the Stoic focus on the singular good of virtue does not find linguistic expression in Paul, his focus on the singular good of a life in Christ points toward a similar structure of thought. Four aspects of the thesis are of particular interest to Philonic studies: () the identification of eleven instances where Philo replicates the Stoic formula ‘virtue is the only good,’ () a comparison between the discussions of the paradox ‘the sage alone is free’ in Philo, Prob., and Cicero, Parad. Stoic., () an evaluation of current debates on Philo’s view of wealth (Mealand R-R , Schmidt R-R , Phillips above ) with attention to Philo’s use of the paradox ‘the sage alone is rich,’ () a discussion of Philo’s application of the paradox ‘the sage alone is king’ to the figures of Moses, Abraham, and Adam.

The third of the allegorical explanations given by Philo at QG . in order to explain why Sarah did not bear children to Abraham is rather obscure. The author suggests that the text may be better understood if it is seen to refer to the Stoic doctrine of the σ  4ς διαλελη &lt;ς, i.e. when the sage instantaneously changes from wickedness to virtue even though he is at first unconscious of the change.

Quite a few of the notes attributed to him in the C-W edition of Opif. stem not from Mangey’s edition but fromhis handwritten notes in his personal copy ofMangey. Eighteen passages where a reading is attributed to Markland in the C-W edition of Opif. are examined to show that sometimes he was the source of the emendation, and contrary to Cohn’s assumption, sometimes Mangey was.

A chapter is devoted to Philo in this volume on Patristic theology as part of the section entitled Rival Traditions: Christian Theology and Judaism. It is not inappropriate to call Philo ‘the first theologian’ (Bousset). His thought is more theocentric than what we find in Greek philosophy. Moreover the Alexandrian Hellenistic Judaism that Philo represents tends to approach religious faith in a dogmatizing frame of mind, as illustrated by the ‘creed’ found at the end of Opif. The article proceeds to outline the main themes of Philo’s thought on the nature and activity of God. It endswith a brief discussion of the critique of Philo’s theology by the fifth-century monk Isidore of Pelusium. (DTR) 204107. D. T.

The paper, written as a contribution to the Festschrift for the Australian Patristic scholar Eric Osborn, offers a comprehensive examination of how Clement appropriates the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers. It first exam- ines the biblical basis of the doctrine, in which Pauline influence is superim- posed on Genesis. It then successively treats the subject in the areas of theology, cosmology and the doctrine of creation, including the creation of humanity. For Clement experience of the divine power (usually in the singular) leads to knowl- edge of God (to the extent possible) and intimacy with Him through the Son. Clement’s Philonic heritage has enabled him to develop a positive and above all a dynamic theology. (DTR) 204108. D. T.

This paper was presented at the  SBL conference in Atlanta as part of a seminar on Etymology and Allegory organized by the Hellenistic Moral Philos- ophy and Early Christianity Program Unit. The paper aims to give an overview of how Philo makes use of etymology as an allegorical technique in his exegesis of scripture. It commences by pointing out the excellent research done by Lester Grabbe onPhilo’sHebrew etymologies in his monograph (RRS ). After some remarks on the distribution of etymologies in Philo’s three main exeget- ical works, it outlines the method in its essentials and demonstrates that an etymological allegorical interpretation consists of four component parts which can be presented in any order: the Hebrew word, its translation into Greek, its symbolism represented by the translation, and a justification of the symbolism. This use of etymology is based on a consistently held general theory of lan- guage. Brief comments are then made on the nine cases where Philo gives Greek etymologies of Hebrew names. Next there is a discussion on how Philo makes use of etymologies in his exegesis, particularly in his allegories. It is suggested that it would be useful to have a complete list of all the names, their usage and </page> <page sequence="304">  part two symbolism and the texts where they are used. The final two sections discuss the source of Philo’s etymologies (he is certainly dependent on earlier exegetical traditions) and the relation of his practice to Greek allegorical allegorizing. There are some parallels to what Philo was doing, but they lack the systematic coherence of his achievement. (DTR) 204109. H.

A dozen of Ambrose’s letters can be regarded as Christian reformulations of Philonic treatises. The author concentrates on a letter addressed to a certain Justus (Ep. ) who had asked Ambrose about the half drachma which the Hebrews had to pay pro redemptione animae suae.

The prevailing attempt to interpret the Pauline Adam-Christ typology in Cor :– from a Philonic background, particularly the text in Leg. ., and to present it as a Christian adaptation is in the opinion of the author a good example of New Testament scholars’ misuse of parallels. Many of them argue that the ontological motifs of Philo were reshaped into a temporal structure and received an eschatological orientation. But in the view of the author the two thinkers deal quite differently with the twofold report of the creation of man in Gen :ff. andGen :.There are twomain differences. Paul sees no distinction between the two human beings created in Gen : and Gen :, whereas Philo does. More importantly the pneumatic human being is never identified with the first human being, but the latter is linked with the ‘earthly Adam’ of Gen :. The author concludes that a crucial piece of evidence for regarding Paul as the earliest date of a knowledge of Philo and his ideas in contemporary Jewish circles of Diaspora is invalidated.

The chapter entitled Sectarian life in New Testament times describes how the two different views on the afterlife in Jewish society—resurrection of the body and immortality of the soul—begin to be blended together. A section of this chapter is devoted to Philo. In his beliefs on life after death Philo can perhaps be considered representative of the new Jewish intellectual class, who are well attuned to Greek philosophical traditions and able to understand the Bible and Judaism in the light of Greek philosophy. Philowas strongly indebted to Platonic ideas on the immortality of the soul. It is he in fact who crafted the notion of the immortal soul which is so familiar in Western tradition, building on the Platonic heritage.There are some passages in Philo which hint at the more native Jewish tradition of bodily resurrection, but these are not developed and he avoids the standard vocabulary for this view. Most often he regards death as the soul’s liberation from the prison of the body. The discussion concludes (p. ): ‘Philo . . . was able to harmonize Judaism with Greek philosophy. For him, both said the same, when each is seen in its finest light.’ (DTR) 204114. T. Seland, ‘The Moderate Life of the Christian paroikoi: a Philonic Reading of Pet :,’ in R. Deines and K.-W.

Postulating a Philonic reader well versed in the works of Philo, this study asks how such a reader would possibly read Pet :, and especially its anthropolog- ical part (b). Such a reader would have recognized several important terms as common to Philo and the Petrine passage. Furthermore there is close to nothing in Pet : that would problematize the understanding inherent in a reader’s Philonic symbolic universe of thought. However, such a reader would certainly find various interpretations in recent research on Pet : strange or strained. (TS) </page> <page sequence="306">  part two 204115. T.

Philo’s wish in the Mos. is to trace out a ‘true’ image of Moses, basing it on the one hand on the ‘autobiographical’ scriptures of the Lawgiver himself and on the other hand on the ancient oral traditions. The aim of this article is to cast some light on the question of revelation and prophecy as related, by analogy and by contrast, to the phenomenon of divination, the latter meant as a set of techniques for pursuing the knowledge of phenomena and events which lie beyond the normal, rational means of investigation and which also reveal the action of superhuman powers. On analyzing Mos. and parallel Philonic texts, we can detect a masterly construction built by the author in order to bring out the true prophet as the interpreter of premonitory signs of the future, a </page> <page sequence="307"> critical studies   mouthpiece for the revelation of the one God, in contrast with the μ ντις– γ ης (Balaam) operating on the contemporary religious scene. In the prophet, the gift of direct inspiration, guaranteeing the truth of the message, and the exercise of his rational faculties in the comprehension of the same message are combined in a close symbiosis.Thismakes the prophet a sage, with a set of ethical and religious prerogatives. The prophetic event in Philo’s perspective has the characteristics of an ecstatic and at the same time invasive experience, as the human intellect stands back before the manifestation of the divine Spirit, which uses its ‘interpreter’ as a tool. Nevertheless, its significance is of a rational nature, because of the very basis of Moses’ revelation, the divine Logos, of which the Judaic law is the expression.This lawhas a universal value because it is essentially identical to the natural law which regulates the whole of cosmic life.

The focus of this article concerns not the question of whether Tim : in some way is dependent on similar thoughts from Philo, but rather the question of what we can find in the works of Philo concerning the doctrine of Inspiration. In considering ‘what was Holy Scripture in st century Israel?’ the author deals with the terms γρα   and γρα α . For Philo this is primarily the Nomos. He then investigates Philo’s reception of the Aristeas legend and his expansion of the same. In a fourth section he deals in more detail with the specific theory of Inspiration in Philo, concluding that he in fact cherishes both a kind of ‘Personalinspiration’ and an inspiration of the written texts of the Scriptures. In the last section the author surmises that wemight even find a kind of ‘Inspiration of the reader’ evidenced in the works of Philo. (TS) 204119. F.

This rich and highly compressed article argues that the track associated with the Hellenistic-Jewish concept of the Logos leads us closer to the centre of Johannine Christology than others connected with speculations on angels, high priests and so on. Ideas such as we find in Philo would have been orally communicated; texts are only a secondary witness. The article proceeds to discuss a number of theological themes which link Hellenistic Judaism of the Philonic type to the Gospel of John. Among these are the relation between σ   α and λ γ ς, the various kinds of divine triads (God and the two powers, </page> <page sequence="308">  part two God–Logos–cosmos), rules that regulate the language used of God, the use of  ε ς with and without the article, the true centre of Johannine Christianity which lies in the pronouncement of the incarnation, and the disappearance of logos-speculation in Judaism. Siegert makes numerous striking observations and claims, including the one that Philo’s Judaism is more spiritualized than Christianity, that ‘Christianity is nothing else than Hellenistic Judaism which has been reorganized around the pronouncement of the incarnation’ (p. ), and that there is only one such pronouncement in the Philonic corpus, namely at QG ., where the ark is the embodiment of the intelligible cosmos.

Although the article has as its chosen theme the figure of Sarah in Philo’s works, it focuses mainly on preliminary issues relating to Philo’s exegetical method. In relation to the question of the inspiration of scripture Siegert first discusses the growth of the ancient legend of the Letter of Aristeas. He then discusses the inspiration of Moses, but also that of the Major Prophets. In scripture Sarah is presented as the ideal woman. Finally, Siegert poses the question of the inspiration of the readers. (GS) 204121. H. J.

In this final contribution on Philo’s thought published not long before his untimely death the author focuses on the doctrine of God, the stream of wisdom that emanates fromHim, and the relationship between that wisdom and human intelligence.

The author’s task was to set the scene for the conference on the relation between Philo and the New Testament. His approach is positive and optimistic. Althoughhe is convinced that there are no direct connections between Philo and the New Testament, he nevertheless argues that there are many traditions which they share. Philo is not as isolated within Judaism as wemight think. At least two </page> <page sequence="309"> critical studies   Jewish authors are demonstrably dependent on him: Josephus and the author of Enoch. Others share traditions with him. Philo was also known to a number of pagan intellectuals. As for New Testament writers, Sterling focuses on four texts where he detects the use of Platonizing traditions reminiscent of what we find in Philo: the Corinthian correspondence, Hebrews, Luke–Acts and the Gospel of John. He is particularly intrigued by the correspondences between Philo’s exegesis of Gen :– and the use made of the same passage by the Evangelist in John :–. Is it not likely that they shared the same Platonizing tradition? In his view this hypothesis has to be worked out in more detail. In short, Sterling argues that Philo’s treatises fill some of the gaps in our knowledge left by theNew Testament documents. The extent to which this can happen depends on how we see Philo’s place in Judaism. (DTR) 204123. G. E. Sterling, ‘Was there a Common Ethic in Second Temple Judaism?,’ in J. J. Collins, G. E.

Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium of the Orion Center, – May  (Leiden ) –. Citing Philo’s description of synagogues as schools of ethical instruction (Mos. .), Sterling asks whether such instruction was typical in the Second Temple period, whether it was uniform, and, if so, to what extent and whether instruction in the Diaspora was similar to or different from that in Israel. A comparison of Philo’s Hypoth., Josephus’s Contra Apionem, and Ps.Phocylides reveals significant similarities in the selection of laws, particularly in the way these are clustered in each text. Sterling identifies nine clusters pertaining to ‘sexuality, violations of others, a household code, disregard of others, concern for others, burial practices, reproductive practices, scales and measurements, and . . . laws that protect animals’ (pp. , ). He suggests that behind the three sources lay a shared body of oral teachings and that the synagogue was the most likely place for this instruction. Sterling then compares the Diaspora sources with the Damascus Document, Temple Scroll, and Halakhic Letter (QMMT). Despite differences regarding openness to the outside world and focus on the concept of holiness, he finds similarities between the two sets of sources in their selection of laws based on Lev – and Deut , and in laws, such as kinds of forbidden marital intercourse, based on common exegetical traditions. He therefore concludes that while the evidence does not support the existence of a common written code, Israel and the Diaspora shared significant ethical teachings. (EB) 204124. G. A. G.

Some traditions describeChrist as laughing in heaven, while Simon of Cyrene is crucified in Christ’s place. The author argues that the laughter of Christ is a reference to the Philonic etymology of Isaac as ‘laughter’. It is noted that Philo too claims that Isaac is a son of God, not of Abraham, and that his mother Sarah was a virgin when she conceived him. (ACG) 204125. K. P.

Taylor investigates the question whether Pythagorean communities and their way of life were an important source of Essene and Christian practices. In dis- cussing the Essene practice, Justin Taylor (not to be confused with his namesake Joan Taylor) uses Philo’s Prob., Josephus, and the Dead Sea Scrolls as sources. The author also refers to Philo’s description of theTherapeutae in Contempl. and notes some common points and differences between on the one hand Philo’s Therapeutae and Therapeutrides and on the other Pythagorean and Essene tra- ditions. Philo, for instance, never mentions the theme of purity.The author con- cludes that the parallels between the Pythagorean and the Essene ways of life can be explained by the influence of the former on the latter.

The Study of Women in Bibli- calWorlds. Essays inHonor of Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza (London ) –. Philo’s highly rhetorical presentation of the Therapeutae and Therapeutrides is characterized by what E. Schüssler Fiorenza has called ‘slippages’, or ‘small ker- nels of reality indicating the real-life struggle of women that are embedded in an androcentric text’ (p. ). The presence of women among the Therapeutae was a problem for Philo’s overall purpose to depict the Jewish group as supe- rior to comparable groups in the Greco-Roman world, among whom women philosophers were sometimes ridiculed or were expected to be wives and moth- ers as well as philosophers. Philo deals with the problem by omitting mention of the Therapeutrides in some contexts and by portraying these women as ‘mostly elderly virgins’, who sat separately from the men, were modest, and were celi- </page> <page sequence="311"> critical studies   bate by choice. The last description suggests an implicit contrast with Greco- Roman cultic figures who were required to be celibate. Through ‘slippages’ in Philo’s account, however, one can view the senior Therapeutrides as equal to the men; they were ‘mothers’, or honored figures in the group, who participated equally with the men in cultic and ecstatic song and the partaking of food, which associated them with the priests at the temple service. This association is especially striking because in the temple service in Jerusalem not only could women not be priests but they could only observe the service from a special area. (EB) 204128. C.

Rashi’s Commentary on Genesis opens with a question: if the Law is the culmination of God’s revelation to Israel, why does the Torah start with Genesis and not for example with Exod :, which is the first command of God on the celebration of the Pascha? This question is implicitly posed and answered by Philo, who affirms that the Patriarchs too, well before Moses, lived in perfect conformity with the Law. In this sense the laws of nature embodied in the Patriarchs have an archetypal value, of which the Torah is a copy, albeit a perfect one. In his thought Philo has three objectives: () to lay a philosophical foundation for the Mosaic laws; (b) to give them the aspect of universality; () to show their value for the political and cultural world in which he lived. For these purposes he uses a fairly vague terminology (ν μ ς  upsilonacuteσεως, ν μ ς :μψυ1 ς, )γρα  ς ν μ ς,  εσμ ς), which allows frequent interaction with various spheres (ethical, political, scientific) along the lines of Cicero’sDe legibus. Contrary to Cicero, however, Philo does not allow for a conception of law that has the possibility of error in the transition from rational principle to written text. Instead he traces a direct relationship between the natural law and the Law ofMoses, becauseGod is the author of both. Philo thus endows theMosaic Torah with a universal value and the patriarchs play a central role in the argument. They achieve a rational knowledge of the natural laws, whereas the process of revelation is reserved for Moses, enabling the transition from rational law engraved in the soul to written text to be protected.

Philo’s taxonomic method is compared with Josephus and Philo’s taxonomic categories are shown to demonstrate affinities to Cicero. Philo can be considered the first author in Jewish literature of the Hellenistic-Roman age who gave preeminence to the Decalogue. (KAF) 204130. F. Thome, Historia contra Mythos.

Stu- dien zur Alten Kirchengeschichte  (Bonn ), esp. –. This study examines the question of whether the allegorical interpretations of emperor Julian exerted a negative influence on the anti-allegorical exegesis of the Antiochene exegetes Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia. A trans- lation is given of Theodore’s preface to Ps . This preface is directed against allegorical interpreters and is partly devoted to Philo and Origen. Theodore claims that Philo was the first to use the pagan method of allegorical reading in the interpretation of scripture. Thome concludes that the allegorical interpreta- tion of Julian probably encounters resistance in Diodore and encourages him to emphasize the historical meaning in his exegesis of scripture. Theodore follows his master Diodore. (ACG) 204131. M. A. Tolbert, ‘Philo and Paul: the Circumcision Debates in Early Judaism,’ in F. Crüsemann (ed.), Dem Tod nicht glauben.

After having briefly sketched the origins of the Jewish circumcision practice, Tolbert deals with Philo and Paul. Drawing primarily on QG .– andMigr. –, she presents the various arguments of Philo for the observance of cir- cumcision (to prevent disease, to increase fertility, and the function of excision of the pleasures). But as circumcision is only formen, Philo maintains its impor- tance as a gender boundary, and furthermore, that its symbolic and literal mean- ings should not be played out against each other. Paul, on the other hand, unlike Philo, makes no attempt to keep the spiritual and the literal together, but sees the two as being atwarwith each other. Furthermore, the symbolic view espoused by Paul not only eliminates the insider/outsider boundary functions of circumci- sion but also eliminates the gender boundary Philo preserves. Finally, Tolbert has some suggestions as to how and where Paul arrived at his view, namely among the Jews of Damascus. (TS) 204132. L.

Political history in Philo is, on the one hand, dependent upon the particular angle from which the public life of the city was observed and the status of the same: in his time Alexandria was one of the largest metropolitan cities of the Roman empire, and, thanks to the papyri and literary texts, it is well known how turbulent and unstable the political situation was. On the other hand, his philosophical conception assigned to politics a role that is brought out very effectively by the beginning of Legat. and theorized in the treatise Ios. Since politics is a direct emanation of the sensible world subject to the Tyche, and precariousness and inconstancy are inherent to politics, history consists in a succession of misunderstandings and failures to comprehend. Philo’s interest in political history serves to probe the question of Nature as opposed to Tyche and thereby reach a greater understanding of the same. (HMK; based on author’s summary) 204133. H.

Tronier (edd.), Frelsens biografisering [Danish: Salvation Biographized] (Copen- hagen ) –. In this article the author attempts to demonstrate his view that the Gospel of Mark is to be read as an allegorical work, written according to the same allegorical principles as Philo uses, for example, when he interprets the biblical narratives on Abraham and Moses. It is the author’s hypothesis that Mark applied an allegorical strategy and way of constructing narratives in order to write into the story of Jesus a Pauline theology. The procedure, according to Tronier, is comparable to the way in which Philo writes into his biblical and ethnic stories a philosophical terminology in order tomake them ‘philosophical.’ Mark thus makes Paul’s ideology ‘Jesuanic’ in a similar way as Philo made the philosophy of his time Jewish/biblical through using the allegorical method.

Origen cites in particular QG  in relation to the plan of the Ark, its tripartite structure which is an image of the human body, and its window compared to the faculty of sight which opens up the first path to philosophy. Also mentioned are the texts concerning Noah the righteous man, whom Philo presents as ‘heir of the divine essence’ and as the ‘true and faithful covenant,’ and texts which deal with the difference between the order of entry into the ark and departure in terms of the difference between separation of the sexes andmixing, i.e. the obligation of continence and that of procreation.

The Essenes at Qumran (the yahad) had a practice of facing the sun in daily prayer at sunrise. Waddell addresses whether this practice should be understood as part of a wider Hellenistic worship of the sun (as Morton Smith claims) or as something more specific to the yahad. To support his argument that the yahad did not pray to the sun itself, as one might understand from Josephus (BJ .), Waddell considers Philo’s description of the Therapeutae (Contempl. ), who also faced the sun at dawn. Examining such texts as Jubilees, QMMT, andHabakkuk Pesher, Waddell underscores the importance of calendar disputes between the Essenes as a whole and the Jerusalem priesthood. Taking into account the Groningen Hypothesis, he believes that the yahad at Qumran separated from the parent Essenemovement because the latter continued to send votive offerings to the Jerusalem temple.The practice of facing the sun in prayer at sunrise would position the worshippers with their backs to the moon and also to Jerusalem. This practice should therefore be understood not as reflective of a wider Hellenistic worship but instead as an expression of the commitment of the yahad to the solar-sabbatical calendar rather than the lunar calendar followed by the Jerusalem priesthood and as opposition to the Jerusalem priesthood itself.

In this study the author interprets Tim :– as an allegory in which the virtues faith, love, holiness, and temperance are portrayed as the children of those women in Ephesus who will be saved. On pp. –, he attempts to substantiate this highly allegorical interpretation by drawing on the allegorical interpretations of Philo. He here finds similar interpretations of virtues as being described as children in Leg. .–, ., ., Congr. –, Her.  and others. He argues that Philo demonstrates that the idea of virtues and vices as children particularly of the soul occurred in the context of the Genesis narrative, and was in currency at the time of Timothy’s author and earlier.

Central to this monograph is the observation that Paul and his fellow Jews read the same scriptural texts, the Torah and the Prophets. As a Jew, Paul is thus a reader of scripture alongside others, and his theology is inter-textual in form. The author deals with Philo in several sections, but especially with his interpretations of Abraham on pp. –. This represents a part of a larger section that discusses the picture of Abraham in Jubilees, in Philo, Paul, and the Genesis texts, thus investigating just this three-sided conversation between scripture, Pauline texts and non-Christian Jewish texts that is so central to the methodology of this study.

In Second Temple Judaism there are two main streams of thought in relation to the temple. The one tends to view the universe as God’s temple and mainly </page> <page sequence="316">  part two negates the earthly temple and sacrifices, the other affirms these. At the same time the positive view towards the concept of temple is accompanied by denun- ciation of the Second temple. Against this background Philo’s views on the tem- ple are examined. The author comes to the unexpected conclusion that Philo stands closer to a text such as QFlorilegium from the land of Israel (her for- mulation) than those of the Hellenistic-Jewish Diaspora which take a negative view of the Jerusalem temple (such as Stephen’s speech in Acts ). Both affirm temple and sacrifices, the difference between them lying in what they identify as the superior temple, in Philo’s case the universe, for the Qumran document the future earthly temple.

To understand the modern Western notion of authorship, Wyrick examines narratives about the history of texts in Jewish, Greek, and Christian traditions and considers implications of these views for the development of canons. He focuses especially on Second Temple and rabbinic sources, Alexandrian schol- arship, and early Christian writers, particularly Augustine. Among these writers, Josephus is a key figure because he expressed the differences between Jewish and Greek perspectives, criticized the Greek approach, and influenced later Chris- tian ideas of authorship. Philo is discussed briefly for his treatment of human vs. divine authorship of the Pentateuch, his position on valid and invalid ora- cles (based on Leg. .), and his account of the miraculous translation of the Septuagint.

The author’s dissertation from Lund University, Sweden, was supervised by Prof. Birger Olsson. It is a kind of narrative analysis of the Gospel of Luke. The reader is invited to accompany the first readers or hearers of the gospel and to experience the narrative alongside them. It utilizes W. Iser’s theory about reading and readers and focuses on gaps and vacancies in the texts. It is also suggested that the readers would probably have been acquainted with comparable stories, and this is where Philo comes into focus. Ytterbrink presents aspects of biographical works of Isocrates, Xenophon, Plutarch, Philo and some others. Of Philo’s biographies she presentsMos.,Abr. and Ios. (pp. – ). It is probably too much to say that Philo’s works are prominent in the rest of this study, but some further comparative remarks occur. Commenting on the Narrator, the author suggests that, when compared to Philo, Isocrates, Xenophon, and many others, the author of theThird Gospel takes a much more obtrusive role, more like that of an editor than of a real author. It was most probably possible for the contemporary audience to apprehend the differences (p. ). (TS) 204145. D.

Zeller criti- cizes his view of Apollos as one who understands himself as a mediator between God and the Christians, comparable to the role of Logos in the works of Philo. Zeller finds this view untenable, and tries to substantiate this by dealing with Sellin’s interpreation of Philo, focusing especially on issues like )ν ρωπ ς  ε upsilontilde as a type, Logos as God’s )ν ρωπ ς, on ‘Idiomenkommunikation’ between the perfect ones and Logos, and the Logos as ‘place’.

It has been argued that the Roman restrictive attitude towards the Collegia, introduced by a Lex Iulia somewhere between  and  b.c.e. was also intro- duced in Egypt. The author of this article argues, however, that the evidence adduced for this suggestion does not really support such a view. The evidence from Philo in his Flacc. on the dissolution of the hetaireiai and synodoi does not support such a conclusion, but is rather to be understood as a temporary response by the Prefect to rising tensions inAlexandria.The other source used as evidence, theGnomon of the Idios Logos §, is too fragmentary andmight only reflect the prohibition by Flaccus the Prefect. Hence, according to the author, the Collegia in Egypt did not suffer from any general prohibition of law. The case of Collegia in Egypt is in fact evidence for the view that the Romans were not suspicious of the collegia as long as they did not challenge the pax Romana.

Does it imply that there was an evolution towards monotheism in the Greco-Roman world, maybe under the influence of Judaism, since the Septuagint translates Elyon by Hypsistos, a divine name used by Philo as well? Through the analysis of votive inscriptions, the author shows that the use of upsilonasperacuteψιστ ς by pagan worshippers is to be understood as a way to exalt the god, which is not exclusivistic and does not imply monotheism. Not only are several gods called upsilonasperacuteψιστ ς, but the god Hypsistos is sometimes mentioned together with other gods whom the devotee wishes to worship as well. True, in the majority of cases, the god Hypsistos is the only one to be invoked, but simply because in this specific religious context the devotion is directed towards this god in particular. Moreover, archaeological data show that gods which were called upsilonasperacuteψιστ ι were worshipped in the same way and through the same rituals as the other gods. Finally, the adjective upsilonasperacuteψιστ ς, which emphasizes the god’s greatness and might, represents a reflection on the essence of the divinity rather than on its unicity.

Just as is the case for many modern commentators, ancient authors, whether Jews or Christians, felt uncomfortable about the eradication of the Canaanite population during the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites. The author dis- cusses one of the ways in which Jewish authors in antiquity, and in particular Philo, justified these massacres. In Spec. .ff. the Alexandrian defends both divine justice and the Israelites who were its agent. He presents the Canaanites as monstrous beings who sacrificed their children to their gods. He also defends the Jewish people against accusations of misanthropy brought against them by Greeks and Egyptians. He turns the tables by accusing them of behaving like the Canaanites when they participate in the Dionysiac cults which accompany human sacrifice or when they expose their newly-born children. These argu- ments show a certain sensitivity towards humanistic objections against the bib- lical accounts, even if they do not imply true adherence to humanism on the part of Jewish authors.

This Leipzig Habilitationshcrift distinguishes between three fundamental parts of the corpus Philonicum: the Exposition of the Law, the Allegorical Com- mentary on the book Genesis and the Quaestiones.

Böhm views the Exposition of the Law as an introduction for interested non-Jews in Alexandria. The ‘difficult texts’ are skipped, discussions between Jews are not mentioned, Philo seems to decline to work directly with the text of LXX and the biblical text is only paraphrased.The narratives have an ethical orientation and an important focus lies on the dualismof virtue and vice, which originate inGod’s creation and providence. The second part of Philo’s œuvre is a real commentary. The readers are supposed to be familiar with the LXX and they are introduced to a universal meaning of the text. The third part, the Quaestiones, is interpreted as an early work of Philo. The main audience for this work also seems to be Jews, to whom a kind of study-book (Studienbuch) is offered. In this way the author relates the narratives of the Patriarchs to the different hermeneutical orientations of Philo’s writings. This is the reason for the different perspectives, varieties and jumps in content, which are normally attributed to Philo as inconsistencies. But in this hermeneutic Philo is underlined as a contextual theologian and narrator. All in all, the writings of Philo are evaluated as different theological approaches adapted for the task of dealing with the tensions between Egypt, Greek and Jewish inhabitants at an intellectual level.

University of Notre Dame ). The dissertation written under the supervision of G. E. Sterling examines the role of the theological intermediary as developed in Middle Platonism and the influence it exerted on theologies founded on a biblical basis. Middle Pla- tonism espoused an intellectual system that would explain how a transcendent supreme principle could relate to the material universe. The central aspect of </page> <page sequence="323"> critical studies   this system was an intermediary, modeled after the Stoic active principle, which mediated the supreme principle’s influence to the material world while preserv- ing its transcendence. Having similar concerns as Middle Platonism, three reli- gious traditions from the turn of the era (Hellenistic Jewish sapientialism, Early Christianity, and ‘Gnosticism’) appropriated Middle Platonic intermediary doc- trine as a means for understanding their relationship to the Deity, to the cosmos, and to themselves. However, each of these traditions varies in their adaptation of this doctrine as a result of their distinctive understanding of creation and humanity’s place therein. In particular Hellenistic Jewish sapientialism (Philo of Alexandria and Wisdom of Solomon) espouses a holistic ontology, combin- ing a Platonic appreciation for noetic reality with an ultimately positive view of creation and its place in human fulfillment. Early Christians (those who speak in Cor :, Col :–, Heb :–, and the Johannine prologue) provide an eschatological twist on this ontology when the intermediary figure finds its final expression in the human Jesus Christ. On the other hand, Poimandres (CH ) and the Apocryphon of John, both associated with the traditional rubric ‘Gnos- ticism,’ draw from Platonism to describe how creation is antithetical to human nature and its transcendent source. The dissertation was published as a mono- graph in  under the title By the Same Word: Creation and Salvation in Hel- lenistic Judaism and Early Christianity (Berlin).

Denningmann,Die astrologische Lehre der Doryphorie: eine soziomorphe Metapher in der antiken Planetenastrologie, Beiträge zur Altertumskunde  (Munich–Leipzig ), esp. –. The Münster dissertation examines the metaphor of the ‘spear-bearers’ (δ - ρυ  ρ ι) who accompany the king in ancient astrological literature. There are also two philosophical treatises in which the image is used in relation to the sun and the planets, the one in Philo, the other in Proclus. After first setting out the different ancient views on the order of the planets, the author introduces the Philonic text, Her. –, in which the sun and the planets as its doruphoroi are compared with the Menorah. Noteworthy in this text is Philo’s use of the Posidonian order of the planets. Next other Philonic uses of the metaphor are examined: the senses as δ ρυ  ρ ι of the mind (cf. Leg. .) and God surrounded by his Powers as δ ρυ  ρ ι (cf. Abr. –). The origin of this use of the metaphor is to be found in Plato Tim. b, but has been mediated through the Hellenistic philosophical tradition. The author then returns to the presentation of the planets as δ ρυ  ρ ι of the sun. The image does not just convey the status of the planets. There is a complex use of analogy involved, which is lucidly set out in a table on p. . The monarchic conception of king, assistants and people has been given a theological, cosmological, psychological and an epistemological application. The essential role of the δ ρυ  ρ ι in the metaphor is that of mediators. The author suspects that the philosopher Posidonius may have played an important role in developing the metaphor, but this cannot be proven because there is no direct textual evidence.

The article briefly introduces the controversy generated by Plato’s creation account in the Timaeus. Dillon is firmly of the view that it should not be taken literally as advocated by Aristotle: there never was a pre-cosmic stage in the cosmos’ creation. Rather it reflects a degree of distortion in its material substratum which gives rise to imperfection. After noting some interpretative stages in the Hellenistic period, he then moves on to Philo, who does not follow Stoic ideas, but rather a Pythagoreanized view perhaps mediated by Eudorus. An interpretation in terms of a creation out of nothing is not an option. Philo of course would not openly abandon the conception that God the creator brought the cosmos into existence. Nevertheless his words atOpif. – come close to the original defence of Plato made by Speusippus and Xenocrates. (DTR) 20521. A. C. Dinan, Fragments in Context: Clement of Alexandria’sUse ofQuotations fromHeraclitus (Philo of Alexandria, Plutarch,Greece) (diss. Catholic University of Washington ). This dissertation provides the results of an investigation into Clement of Alexandria’s use of the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus.The principal means for this investigation is a comparison of those passages in Clement, Plutarch, and Philo of Alexandria which are thought to contain citations of the same Hera- clitean fragments. Few conclusions are drawn respecting the source of Clement’s Heraclitean citations. Instead the thesis concentrates on Clement’s art of cita- tion, his reading of Heraclitus, and the extent to which these had precedent in Philo or Plutarch.The research confirms the lofty esteem in which Clement held Heraclitus, and clarifies the unique way in which Clement invoked the Eph- esian philosopher as a prophetic voice within Greek culture. It is also demon- strated that despite Clement’s reputation for providing accurate citations, he was not averse to modifying the text of the Heraclitean fragments and even to subverting a standard interpretation. The dissertation contributes to the understanding of the appropriation of Heraclitus in Hellenistic philosophy, adds to our understanding of Clement’s penchant for citation, and confers insight into Clement’s thought and working methods.

Romeyer Dherbey and J.-B. Gourinat (edd.), Les Stoïciens, Bibliothèque d’Histoire de la Philosophie (Paris ) – . The author in examining how the transition from the Stoic to the Christian Logos took place emphasizes the role played by Philo. Two important texts are the exegesis of the creation account in Opif. and the depiction of the role of the Logos in Her. ff. The Logos is the agent through which God orders the universe, a conception which brings us quite close to the Stoa. There remains, however, an important difference: the Logos is the agent, but not God himself. But even if there is no conjunction of the two, as in the Stoa, there does remain an oscillation, just as in the case of the Stoic God, between the two conceptions, i.e. sometimes he is the agent of the divine power, at other times a personified deity. The major problem is the status of the logos as both created and creative. The logos is the first-born of God, the Word which he emits and which effectuates creation, but in achieving this the Word in fact takes on the function of God himself. The Logos is thus both Son of God and in his functionGod himself inasmuch as he creates, orders andmaintains the universe. (JR) 20523. C. A.

Fuglseth, Johannine Sectarianism in Perspective: a Socio- logical, Historical, and Comparative Analysis of Temple and Social Rela- tionships in the Gospel of John, Philo, and Qumran, Novum Testamentum Supplements  (Leiden ). This is a lightly revised version of Fuglseth’s doctoral dissertation (Trond- heim, Norway) completed in , on which see above .The study is an investigation of the alleged community behind the Gospel of John, the so-called ‘Johannine community’. The Gospel is analysed by means of social-scientific methods (mainly Stark and Bainbridge), and compared to texts from two other Jewish milieus, the Jewish community in Alexandria as reflected in the works of Philo and the community of Qumran as reflected in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Two issues are primarily focused on as basis for the sociological analy- sis and comparison: () the relationship to the Jerusalem Temple—dealing with John and the Temple (pp. –), the Temple in Philo and Qumran (pp. – ), and Temple-related festivals in John (pp. –); () social relationships to ‘others’ and ‘outsiders’ as found in these writings—Social Relationships in John (pp. –) and Social relationships in Philo and Qumran (pp. – ). Philo is explicitly dealt with in an introductory section (pp. –), in which the author discusses the question: ‘was there a Philo community?’. His qualified answer to this question is that we should only use the notion of a ‘Philo community’ or ‘Philo group’ in a general way, referring to Jews in Alexandria like Philo. Nevertheless, a general Philonic audience is plausible. In pp. – he discusses ‘the Temple in Philo’s writings.’ On the basis of how Philo deals with aspects related to the Temple, Fuglseth characterizes Philo, in spite of his criti- cism of animal sacrifices and rejection of temples of stone, as a Jerusalem adher- ent. Philo never supported an abrogation of the Temple, but criticized those who did. Finally, in Chapter  (pp. –), social relationships in Philo’s writings are described. Although it is hard to find a Philo community depicted in his writ- ings in the same way as in the Gospel of John and in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo nevertheless deals with the relationships to non-Jews. According to Fuglseth, there is a universalizing outlook on the relationships to Gentiles. This relation- ship is described as depending on Israel and her special relationship to God. Hence particularism and universalism are not contradictory concepts in Philo’s case. Reviews: M. Barker, JThS  () –; E. W. Klink III, JETS  (–).

First, the author deals with the notion of divine infinity in Gregory of Nyssa, and criticizes the thesis of E. Mühlenberg that Gregory was the first to ascribe infinity toGod. In the second part Philo’s view is discussed.The opinion ofHenri Guyot that Philo was the first to introduce divine infinity has to be qualified: there are starting points for the notion of divine infinity in Philo, but Philo never calls God infinite. Philo describes God’s blessings and gifts as everlasting and without circumscription, which implies being infinite. God’s gifts are too great for human beings to receive fully and they have to be adapted to the capacity of man. In addition, human beings are unable to understand God fully, so the quest of the soul for God is unending. Gregory, who also presents the search for God as without end, was able to connect up with this notion. (ACG) 20527. R. Goulet, ‘Allégorisme et anti-allégorisme chez Philon d’A- lexandrie,’ in G.

Philo is often regarded as the father and example par excellence of Jewish– Christian allegoresis. But it should not be forgotten that he can sometimes express strong hostility towards certain allegories which he reports. An allegory that is too radical in totally and systematically rejecting the literal sense of the text and which denies the historicity of the persons and the incidents recorded in the Bible cannot be accepted by the loyal Jew Philo, who himself adopted a moderate form of allegorization, to be regarded as a pietistic reaction to a far more audacious kind of allegorical enterprise. In his research the author has found traces of this allegorical enterprise in Philo’s commentaries. Three valuable appendices presenting the treatises of the Philonic corpus, the structure of the Allegorical Commentary, and a list of etymologies and symbolisms round off the article. Reviews: J.

Preliminary to an evaluation of Paul’s critique of Jewish confidence in the election of Israel, a review of the motif of election in the literature of Second Temple Judaism is undertaken. The election of Israel does not play a prominent role in the writings of Philo. Even though Israel is a spiritual entity and does not refer to an ethnic group, the concept, which is an honorary title depicting an elite group that attains to seeing God by means of grace, has not been universalized to include Gentiles in Israel as seers of God.

Hayward, Interpretations of the Name Israel in Ancient Judaism and Some Early Christian Writings: from Victorious Athlete to Heavenly Champion (Oxford ), esp. –. This survey demonstrates that Jewish exegetes’ interpretations of the name ‘Israel’ reflected their contemporary concerns about what was centrally impor- tant to Jewish identity and that some Christians adapted (or may have adapted) Jewish interpretations to suit their own purposes. Chapters cover the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, Ben Sira, Jubilees, Philo, the Prayer of Joseph, Josephus, Rabbinic texts, the New Testament, and Patristic passages. Philo most consis- tently understands ‘Israel’ through the etymology ‘one who sees God.’ Even though he never uses the LXX to support this understanding, his discussions reflect several LXX themes in relation to Israel such as Jacob’s struggle, a link between Jacob’s experience at Bethel in Gen  and his change of name in Gen , prophecy and prophetic inspiration, and Israel as a boundary figure between heaven and earth, sometimes turned toward God, sometimes toward the world. This last theme calls to mind the symbol of the high priest, who represents the Jewish people as a whole, though Philo may also have included non-Jews among those who can see God. The Temple is a place where God might be seen, and Israel, ‘the one who sees God,’ is also the ‘suppliant race’ that has the Levitical role to serve God. Combining this kind of contemplation and service, the Ther- apeutae exemplify what it means to be ‘Israel.’ Hayward further discusses Philo’s understanding of ‘Israel’ in relation to the Prayer of Joseph. Both sources, which have important differences but also similarities, probably drew upon earlier Jew- ish tradition. (EB) 20530. A.

Hilhorst deals with the words of Stephen in Acts :– that Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. First, he asks what can be meant by wisdom and what image the author may have had of Egypt. Secondly, he discusses what Hellenistic Jews had to say about Moses’ education. It is Philo who gives the most extensive picture ofMoses’ education (Mos. .–). Moses learns not only subjects belonging to the Greek encyclical education, but also Egyptian hieroglyphs. Because in Acts Moses is only educated in the Egyptian wisdom, but in Philo he also learns typical Greek subjects from Greek teachers, the view that the author of Acts summarizes Philo’s portrayal cannot be correct. Finally, Hilhorst refers to patristic readings of Acts :, including Clement’s summary of Philo’s account on Moses’ education at Str. ..–. (ACG) 20531. M.

Despite other assessments of the challenge to the Jews posed byHellenization, Himmelfarb, following Elias Bickerman, believes that the Jews were unusually successful in maintaining their distinctness. Whereas Bickerman emphasizes their monotheism, Himmelfarb attributes their success to the Torah, first avail- able in Hebrew and later in Greek. Deuteronomy, with its emphasis on itself as a book but also as oral teaching before a real audience, was especially important for several reasons. As for the role of Torah in the Jews’ encounter with Hellenism, Himmelfarb notes that like Greek readers of Homer, Philo allegorized when the Torah presented problems, but he upheld the importance of literal observance. Chaeremon’s depiction of priests resembles Philo’s portrayal of the Therapeu- tae but—unlike Chaeremon, whose portrait probably held ‘only a rather tenu- ous connection to reality’ (p. )—Philo was constricted by a written text and thus could not characterize the priests of Jerusalem as philosophers. Similarly, Josephus too was constrained by the text of the Torah, in contrast to Philo of Byblos, who also presented a history of his people. Even though Philo and Jose- phus used Greek ideas and values to understand the Torah, the distinctly Jewish text anchored their efforts and was central in preserving the distinctiveness of the Jews themselves.

The article forms the central paper of a conference volume recording the proceedings of a post-graduate seminar in Göttingen on Plutarch’s theology as it relates both to philosophy and to traditional religion. Although there are significant differences between the Delphic priest on the one hand and the exegetically orientated Jew on the other, it also cannot be denied that there are clear convergences between them. The article undertakes to examine them in three specific areas. () Both thinkers anchor their philosophy in their respective religious traditions which they fully espouse in their own lives, claiming that their religion gives access to divine truth and then using philosophy to give expression to their reflection on that truth. () Both share the hermeneutics of allegory and symbolism in order to interpret their respective religious traditions in terms of a Platonic philosophy. Paradoxically, however, in Philo the God of history is transcendentalized, whereas in Plutarch the transcendent God of Academic tradition is personalized and historicised. () When the content of their theology is examined, it emerges that they havemuch in common, not only the shared view that God is immaterial and transcendent, but also that he is one and has a personal relation to human beings. In the final section of the article it is argued that the links between the religious philosophy of two thinkers can be explained through their Alexandrian connection, in Philo’s case because he lived there all his life, in Plutarch’s case through his teacher Ammonius and the </page> <page sequence="330">  part two pythagoreanizing Platonism that goes back to Eudorus, and also through the attraction that Egyptian myths and rites held for him.

In John  allusions are found to the story of the manna in the wilderness (Exod :–), and Jesus says ‘I am the bread of life’. These words are often seen as forming a contrast with themanna story. Hylen poses the question: ‘what if the characters and actions of John  were read as interpreting the story of the Exodus instead of as a departure from this story?’ (p. ). Within this framework the author examines allusions to Exodus in ancient Jewish writings, focusing on Ezekiel, Jubilees, Wisdom and Philo. Philo identifies manna with heavenly wisdom, which is associated with learning that comes without labour. It is food for the soul.Themanna is also equated with God’s Logos. Philo uses details from the manna story to describe the Logos. Hylen suggests that John’s interpretation of Exodus may be shaped by other readings.

Kerkeslager, ‘The Absence of Dionysios, Lampo, and Isidoros from theViolence in Alexandria in C.E.,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. In this article the author argues against the generally accepted view that three members of the Alexandrian Greek elite known as Dionysios, Lampo and Isidoros were involved in the violence in Alexandria in  c.e. In the first section, entitled ‘What Philo does and does not say’, the author argues that Philo’s texts about the violence do not support the view that the three persons were involved. Kerkeslager bases this position on four arguments. () Philo never says that these three persons played a role in plotting the violence. When he </page> <page sequence="331"> critical studies   mentions their names, he uses them to refer to three categories of people. () They are completely absent fromPhilo’smajor reports of the riot against the Jews. () When their activities as individuals are narrated (Flacc. –), they are portrayed not as enemies of the Jews but as hostile towards Flaccus. () In Legat. Philo pictures Isidoros as anti-Jewish but this passage refers to events which happened in Rome after the summer of . The second section deals with the death of Dionysios. Our Dionysios can be identified with the Dionysios that is mentioned in P. Oxy. ., in which the central theme is a conflict between Dionysios and Flaccus. Isidoros, who was exiled in c. –, also appears in the papyrus. Kerkeslager suggests that Dionysios was executed by Flaccus as early as  and almost certainly before . In the third section it is argued that Lampo was not present in Alexandria in , because none of his activities in the city can be dated to . Highly probably, he was in Rome in  because of personal interests. The last section is devoted to Isidoros, and the author claims that his departure fromAlexandria described in Flacc. – has to be dated to before . Isidoros went away from Alexandria into voluntary exile to Rome, where he remained for the entirety of . Because of his crimes it was too risky for him to play a leading role in the troubles in Alexandria. In his conclusion Kerkeslager formulates three major implications of his view: () Because of the absence of known Greeks from the elite in the violence, it is less probable that civic rights were an issue. () Philo’s attribution of blame to the Roman authorities must be taken more seriously. () More attention has to be paid to the possibility that Flaccus was acting in accordance with Roman policies.

In Philo’s day two schools werewell known in philosophical circles in Alexan- dria, Aristotelianism and Platonism. At this time a significant event occurred in the history of philosophy, the meeting of hellenized philosophy and ori- ental thought, particularly in the form of Jewish religious thought which had moved to Alexandria. This is the context for the emergence and development of Philo’s thought, a meeting point of philosophy and religion. Philo’s allegori- cal hermeneutic can be seen as a syncretistic attempt to mediate between Greek, Jewish, and—later—Christian thought. (JR) 20537. J.

Only once does he affirm that the Diaspora of the Jews is a consequence of divine judgment. </page> <page sequence="332">  part two Elsewhere he argues that it is motivated by the desire to ‘colonize’ or by the search for better living conditions.

It remains difficult to determine whether the tension between the hope of the return of the exiles and the positive view of the Diaspora represents a contradiction that is real, i.e. psychological or biographical–chronological, or whether it only appears to be such. But elsewhere the juxtaposition of acceptance of the diaspora situation and adherence to eschatological expectation is quite common. Reviews: U. Becker, ZATW  () . (DTR) 20538. G.

The paper argues at considerable length that the notion of ‘true’ or ‘genuine’ light in the Prologue to John’s Gospel has a Greek-philosophical background particularly in the Platonic tradition. Philo provides valuable evidence, notably in his connection of intelligible light with the divine Logos. Both Philo and John assume the Platonic differentiation between the intellectual and the visible realms. The idea was not strange because the LXX already offered the basis for this interpretation in its phrasing of Gen :a, ‘but the earth was invisible and unformed.’ The author also notes the favourable view that Philo has of Plato (p. ).

But he does add and underline what he regards as important. Philo also interprets the miracles allegorically. A very important theme in his interpretation is the emigration of the soul out of the body and its struggle against desire and pleasure.TheExodus out of Egypt is the symbol of the spiritual emigration. Philo can offer a natural explanation for a miracle, but this is no reason to assume that he explains the miracles rationally. He presents Moses as both a prophet and a miracle-worker, and sometimes ascribes violent miracles to Moses. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="333"> critical studies   20540. A. Kovelman, Between Alexandria and Jerusalem: the Dy- namic of Jewish and Hellenistic Culture, The Brill Reference Library of Judaism  (Leiden ). This book seeks to understand the interplay of changes in Jewish and Greco- Roman cultures within the context of various political, social, and economic developments in the larger society. Kovelman sees ‘Jewish cultures of the Second Temple and Talmudic periods as stylistic systems,’ and key to stylistic changes was ‘the collapse of an old literature and the creation of a new one’ (p. xii). In Ch. , the author uses Greek papyri from Roman and Byzantine Egypt to understand the transition from theMishnah toGenesis Rabbah in the fourth and fifth centuries c.e. In the second chapter, he argues that differences between late biblical and early rabbinic literatures reflect ‘a general literary revolution . . . in theRomanEmpire during the first and second centuries c.e.’ (p. xiii). InCh. , he turns to the relationship between Alexandrian exegesis and Rabbinic Midrash. Ch.  focuses on the Letter of Aristeas from the perspective of Aggadic Midrash and early Christian literature. In Ch. , Kovelman examines the connections between popular mentality and changing literary styles in the early centuries c.e. A discussion of the Philonic evidence is located primarily in Ch. , and is based on the author’s earlier papers, ‘Continuity and Change in Hellenistic Jewish Exegesis and in Early Rabbinic Literature’ and ‘A Clarification of the Hypothesis’ (see  and ).

Vervenne (edd.), Interpreting Translation: Studies on the LXX and Ezekiel in Honour of Johan Lust, Bibliotheca EphemeridumTheologicarum Lovanisensium  (Leuven ) –. This article deals with the so-called ‘aberrant’ texts in Philo, deviations from the standard LXX text which some manuscripts display. The point of departure is the study by D. Barthélemy (RR ), who argues that the ‘aberrant’ texts of biblical quotations are based on Aquila’s version, and that the ‘retoucher’ was Jewish. Kraft focuses on those passages in which quotation formulae such as ‘Moses said’ appear in some manuscripts, while others display a more general identification such as ‘the sacred word says’. There are ten passages in Somn.  that show this difference. Because suppression of the formula ‘Moses said’ is not evidenced in other infected treatises apart from Somn. , Kraft concludes that the changes go back to a time when Somn.  circulated by itself. The changes, made in the nd and rd century c.e., were probably done by a rabbinically minded Jew, because rabbinic Judaism avoids explicit attributions to Moses. Appendix  offers an overview of references in Philo to Moses as scripture- speaker, Appendix  to ‘lawgiver’ as scripture-speaker, while Appendix  lists the ‘sacred word’ references.

Brancacci (ed.), Philosophy and Doxography in the Imperial Age, Accademia Toscana di Scienze e Lettere «La Colombaria» Studi  (Florence ) –. Without doubt Philo is a major source of the study of philosophical doxog- raphy, but little use has been made of his evidence, partly because historians of philosophy have shown little interest in him, partly because his writings are rather inaccessible. The author does not wish to focus on Aet., because it can- not be considered characteristic of the problems posed by the study of doxog- raphy in Philo (and its authenticity is still not wholly beyond dispute). Instead he prefers to analyse two other examples. The first concerns the passions of the soul and focuses on the texts Leg. ., Agr. , Congr.  and Leg. .. These texts reveal that Philo does not consider the various passions to be on an equal footing, but regards pleasure as the foundation for the other three. There would appear to be a connection with Posidonius, but it would be wrong to claim that Philo’s view of Stoicism was wholly determined by that thinker. Philo respects Stoicism for the way it gives expression to ethical perfection, but is critical of its doctrine of immanence. The second example discussed at greater length relates to the sceptical tropes in Ebr. –. Much has been written on this passage, and in particular on its relation to the other sources Sextus Empiricus and Dio- genes Laertius. Lévy points out that differences between them could be not just a matter of style or the use of a different source. It is also possible that they point to the incompatibility of the sceptical arguments with Philo’s philosophical and religious convictions. He points to at least two interventions on the part of Philo, the omission of the argument that human beings are not truly superior to ani- mals, and the omission of the example ofmythology. It is also noted that in Philo’s day the tropes may not have had the same fixed form and number that they later acquired. Lévy determines that in Philo only eight of the ten tropes found in Sex- tus can be identified. He concludes the article by arguing that Philo’s evidence in doxographical matters shows that he is ‘infinitely better informed about the history and current state of philosophy’ than has often been thought (p. ). He is also interesting because he is not a professional and so gives evidence of the movement of doctrines from the philosophical schools to the cultured public. (DTR) 20544. R.

The </page> <page sequence="335"> critical studies   author suggests that Philo sees idolatry as having different grades of seriousness, from worship of the elements, of demigods, of actual idols of wood and stones, to the worst: Egyptian animal worship. He finds some similarities between Philo andWisdom of Solomon, but not enough to suggest a common tradition. In the rest of this study, the texts of Philo play no central role in the author’s discussions of Corinthians. (TS) 20545. M. F.

The article investigates whether exegetical traditions in Ancient Judaism can be institutionally identified. The author offers a detailed introduction discussing the problems of studying Hellenistic Judaism in comparison to Palestinian Judaism, stressing that many sources have been lost and many of those extant cannot be located with any degree of certainty. Concerning Philo, the author argues hesitantly against the current consensus that assumes organised Torah study in Alexandria with which Philo was familiar. Following Dillon, the author rather stresses Philo’s individual synthesis of Greek traditions with the Biblical text. (MRN) 20546. S.

The Armenian translation of Leg., attributed to the ‘Hellenizing school of translation’ (th or th century), is characterized by a strong textual correspon- dence between the Greek source text and its Armenian rendering. Starting with a few concrete examples, the author proceeds with analytical reflections on the process of translation in general. The article concludes with the observation that the ‘Hellenizing school’ and the translation of Philo’s works have contributed to both the lexical and the syntactical development of the Armenian language.

Philo, notwithstanding his biblical belief in a Creator God, in Aet. de- fends the Aristotelian thesis of the eternity of the world as ungenerated and </page> <page sequence="336">  part two incorruptible. The article first reviews the ‘crisis of the Platonists and Stoics’ (who saw thematerial world as generated and possibly perishable) as an effect of Aristotle’s arguments. It then discusses how Philo in Aet. dismantles objections against the corruptibility of the world, and how he presents arguments in favour of this thesis (the most important: Providence has willed the world to be unperishable). There follows a discussion of the ‘riddle’ represented by the end of Aet. (the reference to a counter-argumentation in a lost second part). The article concludes with the allegorical solution regarding the eternity of creation exposed by Philo in his exegetical treatises, where he attributes incorruptibility to the intelligibleworld (in the logos) as distinct from thematerial world.

The article considers a hermeneutic theory, in which the biblical text and the organization of the world and its history correspond to the same creative Logos, with human beings having an intermediate place that allows them to understand these languages and to be comprehended by them. The article also presents a hermeneutic technique according to which the whole text of the Pentateuch has a finished coherence for the communication of truth if it is read through the norms of Greek exegesis. Finally, it presents a hermeneutic praxis in the sense that the Pentateuch is the crucial factor for the ethical and political formation of the Jewish community, especially in the Diaspora.

This article presents the development of primitive Christianity as a progres- sive interpretation of texts, first of the writings with Hebrew origins, later also of the properly Christian books. For this hermeneutical core Philo had made some important preparations, like the concept of ‘typos’ applied to Adam and a double dimension of the sense of the Torah, comparable to the relation between body and soul.

This article considers the two terms,   ασ ς and συσσ τι ν, which Philo uses to describe the Essenes as brotherhoods and affiliations, cf. Hypoth. .. Although Philo does not explain the meaning of these terms, they must have been understandable for his readership. They probably refer to small communi- ties that held table and house in common. This agrees with the information we have about Qumran. (JPM) 20553. G. W. E. Nickelsburg, Jewish Literature between the Bible and theMishnah: a Historical and Literary Introduction. nd ed.

For this new edition of the classic introduction to the literature of Sec- ond Temple Judaism (first edition published in ) the author has broad- ened his approach and so has added sections on Philo and Josephus miss- ing previously. The section on Philo is located in the chapter entitled ‘Israel in Egypt’ and is, as the author indicates in n. , an abridged version of his paper in the Philo and the New Testament volume published in  (see above ). Philo is regarded as an important and significant figure among Hel- lenistic Jews around the turn of the era, but in Nickelsburg’s view he was not unique. His works do, however, furnish a unique window into the world of Hellenistic Judaism. Without his corpus, our knowledge of this phenomenon would be greatly impoverished and our view of the Judaism of this period would be less balanced. Reviews: R. D. Chesnutt, SPhA  () –.

The author compares Philo’s and Josephus’ interpretations of the biblical figure of Joseph, asking whether the personality or historical situation of the interpreter is reflected in his exegesis. Both interpreters are shown to offer topical interpretations.Thefigure of Joseph enables Philo to reflect on the issue of Jewish existence in Egypt, showing in the literal interpretation how an ideal leader maintains his Jewish identity in mental separation from the environment, while the allegory takes into account the reality of Jewish assimilation to Egypt which Philo frowned upon. (MRN) 20556. E. F. Osborn, Clement of Alexandria (Cambridge ), esp. –. In his final monograph the author returns one more time to the subject of Clement’s debt to Philo in a chapter full of rich insight entitled ‘Philo and Clement: from Divine Oracle to True Philosophy.’ A rational reconstruction of the thought of the two writers reveals common ground in their essential monotheism. Philo moves from divine oracle to true philosophy with a central focus onMoses and the Law. Clement makes the same move with a central focus on Jesus and theGospel.The decisive difference between them lies in the relation of the Logos to God. For Philo the powers under God unite in the Logos. For Clement there is reciprocity of God and Logos, Father and Son. In addition Clement’s view of the role of the Jewish people differs from Philo’s. It is more complex and also more abstract, because he did not have direct contact with Jews.The chapter proceeds to examine the main passages where Clement makes use of Philo, first the four short sequences, then the four longer passages. Some reflections are appended on literary issues and the problem of why Clement gives so little acknowledgement of his debt to Philo. Osborn concludes that Philo anticipates parts of Clement’s ‘true dialectic,’ but lacks his redefinition in terms of prophecy and economy. Both Philo and Clement are audacious in their thought, but Philo lacks Clement’s gift for argument. Clement did not see Philo as a rival, but as one of the many predecessors who had said something well.The concluding words are worth quoting: ‘Clement found in Philo the wonder of the elusive God and the richness of the history of Moses. Wonder was for Clement the beginning of knowledge and, time and again, Philo pointed to the wonder of scripture.’ (p. ) (DTR) </page> <page sequence="339"> critical studies   20557. M.

The concept of πνεupsilontildeμα has an extensive range of meaning in Philo. Philo’s lack of interest in prophetic eschatology indicates that for him divine Spirit is not something to be anticipated in the future. As the principle of life and reason Philo does not think divine Spirit has been withdrawn from Israel. The Spirit and gift of prophecy are presently available to all, depending on one’s moral status and not limited to a few good wise men within Judaism. The Spirit is the source of charismatic revelation, wisdom, and knowledge, as well as skills and abilities.

There is no other concept in Philo’s thought as complex (and seemingly confused) as that of the λ γ ς. It is argued in this article that the reason for this lies in the fact that for Philo the same doctrine can be expressed both in philosophical and in biblical terms (and in Philo’s eyes the latter option is the better of the two). Philo represents an important step in Jewish Hellenistic thought: from a physical conception of God’s workings (Aristobulus: dynamis) to a metaphysical one, for which Philo (maybe surprisingly so) makes use of the Stoic concept of logos aswell as of theDemiurge in Plato’sTimaeus.The influence of Philo’s logos theory was not limited to Jewish Hellenistic thought, but reached Middle Platonism,Gnosticism, the Prologue of theGospel of John, and Plotinus.

This monograph deals with the problem of moral progress in ancient Sto- icism. In Part II the views of Philo and Plutarch are discussed. In Philo’s philo- sophical interpretation of Scripture the theme of moral progress takes an impor- tant place. In Scripture he finds several examples of πρ κ πτ ντες (Aaron, Noah) and various symbols of πρ κ π . On the road to virtue the πρ κ - πτων is somewhere between total wickedness and perfection, the former rep- resented by a totally bad person such as Cain, the latter by the few people able to attain wisdom and to become σ   ς like Abraham. Roskam concludes that Philo is acquainted with the Stoic doctrine of moral progress but the Stoic view is not his basic frame. He does not, as the Stoics do, regard the πρ κ πτων as fundamentally bad. Rather, he is inclined to the Peripatetic-Platonic view in which progress is seen as a separate third phase different from both virtue and vice. Although Philo uses several Stoic notions, he is not a Stoic philosopher. (ACG) 20562. D. T. Runia, ‘A Conference on Philo in Germany,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –.

After a sketch of the social situations of Philo and Paul, the author discusses their treatment of various aspects of alien religion under headings such as ‘The Evaluation of alien Gods,’ ‘Participation in alien religious activities,’ ‘Arguments from the Bible,’ ‘Conversion and apostasy,’ and ‘The rescue from polytheism and idolatry.’ The main text of Paul investigated here is Cor :–:. From Philo he draws on a wider set of texts. He emphasizes that Philo considers polythe- ism a strong evil force, and he may attribute it both to ignorance and to an evil aim in the minds of those who have introduced polytheism. Furthermore, Philo apparently considers club-meetings as a dangerous arena of polytheism, and he uses the episode of the golden calf in the desert as a warning example. Finally, in Philo’s view the rejection of polytheism cannot be achieved by human beings through their own powers, but they are in need of God’s help.The author’s main conclusion is that the way Paul handles what he sees as idolatry demon- strates that he is an heir of the same Jewish tradition which Philo represents.

In the lightly revised edition of her dissertation (Humboldt University, Berlin ) the research assistant of the German Septuaginta translation project deals with the meaning and function of Passover in Early Judaism and the Gospel of John. Philo has a particular importance for Hellenistic Judaism. Methodically, Schlund operateswith the classification developed from the research of P. Borgen and F. Siegert. Two themes should be distinguished from each other in the interpretation of Passover. On the one hand there is the allegorical explanation: the estrangement of the soul from the passions (= Egypt) and the acceptance of the pure wisdom and truth (= Land of Canaan); this explanation (δι  ασις) is unique to Philo’s works. On the other hand Philo stresses the importance of the (high)-priestly intervention on behalf of the entire (Jewish) people. In this way Passover is first and foremost a feast of thanks and enjoyment through the deliverance from slavery in Egypt, uniting all the people in a congregation of worship (συναγωγ ). The slaughter of the sacrificial animal without any participation of cultic staff reminds thereof. Except for the sacrifice by all the Israelites, the Passover animal and its blood does not play any part. It is striking that neither in the historical nor in the allegorical interpretation is there any mention of the protection or sparing of the Israelites by God. It seems that this aspect (especially of the LXX) does not carry any weight for Philo, althoughhis texts do pick up specific Septuagintal terminology rather frequently. (GS) 20566. T.

Shaw, ‘The Emperor Gaius’ Employment of the Divine Name,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The article focuses on Philo’s account of the words of the Emperor Gaius to the Embassy of Alexandrian Jews (of which Philo himself was the leader) in Legat. . Two main problems are discussed. First, how are Gaius’ words to be interpreted? Shaw discusses the two different understandings of the words (i.e. the adjective  κατ ν μαστ ς refers to God or to the Emperor himself) and concludes that Philo might have wished to convey both interpretations that have been made by modern scholars. The second question is the divine name that Gaius most likely uttered. It is argued that it would have been a Greek name and that it was most likely Ιαω. In an Appendix Shaw discusses evidence for the knowledge of a Hebrew divine name among Romans. A brief response to the article was published by P. W. van der Horst; see below .

Bakhos (ed.), Ancient Judaism in its Hellenistic Context, Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism  (Leiden ) –. The author deals with the question of the extent to which Hellenistic philos- ophy was popular among Second Temple Jews. To examine this issue Sterling discusses three areas in which both Hellenistic philosophy and Jewish thought are interested: theology, creation, and ethics. In this discussion frequent refer- ences are made to Philo. His conception of the transcendent God, for instance, is influenced by Hellenistic thought. He offers a Platonizing exegesis of the cre- ation account in Genesis. Concerning ethics, Jewish writers identify Mosaic leg- islation with natural law. Sterling concludes that there were exegetical tradi- tions influenced by Hellenistic philosophy that enjoyed wide circulation. As a consequence we should take the influence of Hellenistic philosophy on Greek- speaking Judaism seriously. (ACG) 20571. G. E. Sterling, ‘ ‘Day One’: Platonizing Exegetical Traditions of Genesis :– in John and Jewish Authors,’ The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The author first affirms that the Prologue of the Gospel of John is based on Gen :–, and then argues that there are points of contact between the Pro- logue and the Platonist tradition. Four Platonizing features are discussed: () the world of being versus the world of becoming; () the Logos; () prepositional metaphysics () light versus darkness. Other Platonizing exegetical traditions of Gen :– can be found in Philo and in Enoch. In his discussion about Philo’s creation account in Opif. Sterling deals with the same Platonizing topics found in John. Regarding the treatment of Gen :– in John, Philo and Enoch the author concludes that all three texts identify ‘day one’ with the eternal, intelligi- ble, or invisibleworld.Thedifferences suggest that theymade independent use of a common tradition. The tradition was transmitted to later Christians (Clement, Origen, Eusebius) largely, although not exclusively, through the works of Philo. (ACG) 20572. C.

It first analyses the natural relation of parents and children, treated specially in Decal. – and Spec. .–. In the author’s view this relation has the following characteristics: </page> <page sequence="345"> critical studies   it is hierarchic, asymmetric—because the children will not be able to repay the received gifts—, contains reciprocity and affection, and includes a promise of immortality by the fact of having children. The semantics of filiation extends to other hermeneutical fields: the filiation of the world in respect to God and the Logos as first-born. Considering specially Conf. – the article analyses the distinction of degrees in the filiation of those who have a human being, the Logos, or God as father. Philo develops the Greek idea of virtue caused by divine seed but denies that this topic has any mythological implications. The mother of God’s son is not Rachel but Leah, not a woman but a virgin. The author credits the Greek sources that Philo uses, especially those with a Platonic background, but she argues that Philo uses these sources to give original readings of biblical texts. The result is not far from a New Testament idea, namely that true sonship does not occur by ties of blood but derives from a gift of God. (JPM) 20573. L.

For guidance about the role of humans in relation to animals and to God, the author considers the law of not boiling a kid in its mother’s milk, especially in Deut :b. Philo and others view this law, whose significance is obscure, as relating partly to the pain that the suckling mother would feel if she could not express milk to her young. The law must also, however, be seen in the larger context of the mother-offspring bond. Here too, Philo—followed by later Jewish and Christian exegetes—provides evidence that this and other biblical laws regarding animal mothers and offspring were meant to show kindness to animals. Another possible explanation, found in Virt. , is the separation of the forces of life (represented by the mother’s milk) and death (represented by cooking), a theme also found elsewhere in biblical laws pertaining to animals. This explanation and others aid Vasantharao in understanding why the rabbis greatly developed the prohibition of boiling a kid in its mother’s milk to extend to the separation between milk and meat products and utensils.

Concerning the background of the missionary consciousness of Paul, Ware rejects the possibility of relevant figures in Hellenistic philosophy or religion as models, and focuses instead on Paul’s Jewish background. Chapter One deals with ‘The Problem of Jewish Mission’ (pp. –). Did the missionary consciousness of the early Christians have its origins in Judaism? And if so, in what ways? Ware here deals with the much discussed questions of Jewish missionaries, the number of converts, and the nature of the ‘God-fearers.’ His conclusions are that there is little evidence that converts were actively sought by Jews, and that there is no evidence of missionaries and/or missionary preaching to Gentiles. ChapterThree deals with ‘Conversion of Gentiles and Interpretation of Isaiah in Second Temple Judaism’ (pp. –). The main question here is: ‘to what extent were Jewish attitudes toward Gentiles in the second temple period related to the Old Testament, especially the book of Isaiah?’ Ware here deals with the relevant texts from Isaiah in the LXX version, with Targum Isaiah, Sibylline Oracles, Wisdom of Solomon, the parables ofEnoch, Philo of Alexandria, Rom:–, as well as theTestament of Levi and some related Qumran texts. In his analysis of Philo (esp. Virt. – , Spec. .–, Mos. . and .–, Abr. ), he finds that Philo did understand the Jewish people to have a priestly and mediatorial role for the Gentiles, but there is no concern for amission for their conversion.Hewelcomed present-day proselytes as a foreshadowing of the future eschatological coming. Summarizing the results of his investigation of these Jewish texts,Ware finds that there existed a widespread interest in an eschatological conversion of Gentiles, but not all shared the same interest in the present conversion of Gentiles, and there is no evidence to be found of a concern for mission.

This dissertation argues that Rom :– should be understood as a dramatic depiction of the death of the soul, a moral-psychological condition ascribed to extremely immoral persons. In Chapter  the author discusses Hellenistic discussions of extreme immorality and focuses on Philo of Alexandria who often uses death analogies to describe the mind which has been completely overwhelmed by the passions. It is argued that Paul represents such an extreme type of wickedness in Rom :– and that he similarly uses death and dying as moral-psychological metaphors to describe the mind’s total domination by passions and vices.The study was published under the same title as amonograph in  (Tübingen).

Weitzman, Surviving Sacrilege: Cultural Persistence in Jew- ish Antiquity (Cambridge Mass. ), esp. –. </page> <page sequence="348">  part two Weitzman studies the tactics that Jews used to preserve their culture, partic- ularly in times when the Temple and/or Jewish ritual were endangered. He thus considers the Babylonian destruction of the First Temple, the threat against Jew- ish religious practices by Antiochus IV in the time of the Maccabees, Caligula’s attempt to install a statue of himself in the Temple, and the Roman destruc- tion of the Second Temple. Philo is discussed most prominently in the chapter on the crisis with Caligula, based on Philo’s account of the Embassy (pp. – ). Weitzman focuses on Agrippa’s approach to the Emperor and analyzes it in terms of notions that were nearly contemporary with Philo about friendship and flattery. Recognizing that Philo’s account of Agrippa and his letter to Caligula is a rhetorical device, Weitzman then considers Philo’s own tactics and concludes that he presents Jewish culture and imperial rule as having an important affinity, but one that is not quite complete because of the Jews’ commitment to preserv- ing their ancestral beliefs and practices. After Caligula’s assassination, Claudius acted favorably to the Jews because of the friendship that he had with Agrippa and Herod and the friendship that the Jews had shown to the Romans. In rela- tion to the Caligula episode and its immediate aftermath, therefore, the Jews managed to preserve their culture by having ‘Friends in High Places’ (which is the title of this chapter).

Plato’s understanding of courage ( νδρε α) in theRepublic provides a gateway to a thoroughgoing comparison of Cicero and Philo with respect to their philo- sophical understandings of courage, as understood in relation to other virtues deemed essential for personal, civic, and military life. Both Cicero and Philo work out their treatments in the context of participating in public life. A sys- tematic commentary on Philo’s treatment of courage, found in De fortitudine (= Virt. –), presupposes realities specific to Philo’s situation in Roman Egypt and his political desire to construct an image of Judaism congenial to the ideol- ogy of the Roman ruling classes, as reflected in the propaganda of the Augustan principate.

Winslow, Early Jewish and Christian Memories of Moses’ Wives: Exogamist Marriage and Ethnic Identity, Studies in the Bible and Early Christianity  (Lewiston N.Y. ), esp. chapters  and . The accounts of Moses’ Midianite wife, Zipporah, in Exod :, and  and his unnamed Cushite wife in Num  give rise to several exegetical motifs that includeMoses’ exogamous marriage(s), Zipporah’s act of circumcision, and Moses’ later celibacy. Winslow examines how these accounts and motifs are treated in the Hebrew Bible, later Jewish sources—including the LXX, Arta- panus, Demetrius, Ezekiel the Tragedian, Jubilees, Philo, Josephus, Targums, and Rabbinic literature—and Christian sources—including Origen, Tertullian, </page> <page sequence="349"> critical studies   Aphrahat, Ephrem the Syrian, Jerome, and Gregory of Nyssa. Philo does not appear to be bothered by Moses’ marriage to a Gentile, but he does not refer to Zipporah’s act of circumcision in any of his writings. This omission may reflect Philo’s general tendency to avoid portraying women as taking initiative or having the ability to influence Israel’s history. InMos. , Philo mentions Moses’ marriage and children (from Exodus) without referring to Zipporah by name. She is named, however, inMut., Post., and Cher., in which she is allegorized, as is Moses’ Ethiopian wife (fromNum ) in Leg. . Both wives represent qualities that advance Moses’ character development. Philo is the first Jew we know of to claim that Moses renounced sex in order to be prepared to hear God’s words (Mos. .–). This claim appears to be influenced not by exegetical concerns, as in some other sources, but by ‘Philo’s fundamental assumptions about the incompatibility of the ‘female’ with the attainment to knowledge of the divine’ (p. ).

Bellia (edd.), The Book of Wisdom in Modern Research, Deuterocanonical and Cognate Literature Yearbook (Berlin ) –. As the title promises, this article surveys scholarship on the Book of Wis- dom over the past century. A central, puzzling issue is the Book’s combination of an apocalyptic outlook and philosophical sophistication. Winston discusses examples of the conjoining of wisdom and apocalyptic in other literature and mentions Philo in passing to illustrate the theme that unmediated understand- ing given by God is superior to mediated learning acquired through a teacher. InWisdom, wisdom is understood as ‘immanent divine causality’ (p. ), which is not explicitly identified with Torah. Relevant in this context is Philo’s under- standing of natural law and of the patriarchs as its living embodiments. One can also discern similar tensions between apocalyptic and philosophy in Philo, whose ‘quasi-apocalyptic messianic vision’ (p. ), restricted to only a few pas- sages, seems to conflict with his notion of divine providence. Winston suggests that both sources were written during the period of severe persecution of the Jews in Alexandria and that both authors were motivated ‘by the need to fuse Jewish tradition with Greek philosophy in an attempt to defend its integrity both in the face of persecution and the intellectual changes of pagan culture’ (pp. – ). Biblical exegesis, therefore, is only secondary to this aim. For the Italian version of this article published earlier see above . (EB) 20583. J. Woyke, Götter, ‘Götzen,’ Götterbilder.

Discussions on aspects of Philo’s theology occur at various points in this Tübingen dissertation. On pp. – there is an extensive excursus on the </page> <page sequence="350">  part two terminology used for foreign gods, in which Philo’s use of the terms εBδωλα,  ε πλαστε(ν and  ε   is also investigated. It is only against the background of a Platonic world-view that the term εBδωλ ν can have the double signification of ‘a divine image’ and ‘phantom’. The designation of the stars as  ε   α8σ ητ  , however, is conventional and does not imply veneration. On pp. – Philo’s concept of faith is outlined: it comprises knowledge of God, trust in God, and conversion as well. On pp. – F. Siegert’s thesis that QE . betrays the existence of polytheistic sympathizers of the Hellenistic synagogue is contested. Jethro, however, could be the symbol of such an exterior circle of adherents. Further references to Philo’s doctrine of monotheism are found on pp. – and –. The author observes a tendency to abstract from God’s activity in history; in contrast to Stoicism, Philo confines the knowledge of a Creator’s existence to the intellectual inference of philosophers.

Themonograph is a revision of the author’s  dissertation submitted to the faculty at the University of Durham. In order to understand Philo’s place in Early Judaism and his approach to Gen :–, Philo’s role as an exegete, his audience, and his view of the soul, and in particular its immortality, are discussed. Philo’s interpretation of the text offers an alternative approach to the responsibility for human suffering to the tradition set forth in Enoch –.TheWatcher tradition describes the ‘angels of God’ as rebellious angels who entered the human realm to fornicate with women. Philo interprets them as ‘souls’ that descend to earth to take on a human body. For Philo, the giants are neither physical nor spiritual entities. They are irrational vices born as a result of being drawn into the torrents of the flesh.Despite differences, the giants of theWatcher tradition and the giants of Gig. threaten the survival of humanity, although one is external and the other internal to the person. Philo may have been writing a corrective to Watcher tradition and its view that evil spirits are the cause of human sufferings. (KAF) 20585. A. T.

Philo begins the story of the influence of Plato on the formation of Jewish, Christian and Islamic philosophy. A number of pages are devoted to his thought under the heading ‘Middle Platonisms’, focusing on his interpretation of creation in Opif. and his mystical reading of the Pentateuch as an allegory of the flight of the soul from the lower material realm to divine knowledge.

In Leg. the woman Eve symbolizes sensitivity in front of Adam, the intellect, and receives a sub- ordinate but necessary place in the anthropological vision of Philo. In other treatises of the Allegorical Commentary the figures of Sarah and Hagar have subordinate functions in the acquisition of wisdom, which is proper to Abra- ham. In Contempl. Jewish women, called the Therapeutrides, accompany the male Therapeutai. They reach the state of eudaimonia by leaving the female characteristics and acquiring virtues of a man. In general it is concluded that Philo has a positive view of women, but always in a role that is subordi- nate and complementary in relation to the man striving for perfection. It is only through identification with the male that the woman can embody virtue. (JPM) 20603. J. E. Atkinson, ‘Ethnic Cleansing in Roman Alexandria in ,’ Acta Classica (South Africa)  () –. The riots against the Jews in Alexandria in  c.e. were caused by a deep- seated anti-Semitism which had a long history. The visit of King Agrippa I worked like a catalyst and was the immediate cause of the pogrom, as can been seen from Philo’s attempt to exculpate him. Philo emphasizes that it was not Agrippa’s plan to visit the city. In addition, political circumstances played a role because Gaius was more prepared to promote a ruler cult than Tiberius had been. There were also tensions between Alexandrian Greeks and Egyptians. (ACG) 20604. J. M. G. Barclay, ‘ ‘By the Grace of God I amwhat I am’: Grace and Agency in Philo and Paul,’ in J. M. G.

In his comparisons the author finds that both Philo and Paul emphasize the priority of divine grace, as the originating cause of salvation, including human virtue, but that there is a substantial difference in the theological framework in which they place this grace. For Philo grace is the creative energy of God; for Paul it is revealed and enacted in the Christ-event, and as such is an eschatological event of a new creation. (TS) 20605. A.

The paper discusses interpretations of Num :– given by Jewish writers in the first centuries c.e. (Philo, Mishnah, Mekilta of Rabbi Yishmael, Targumim). In Philo’s reading, the serpents that bite the Israelites represent pleasure: the people wish to go back to Egypt, the incorporeal mass, and they die in a spiritual sense. Beholding the bronze serpent of Moses heals them. In Philo’s view, looking to the serpent means that they observe God Himself. The author concludes that most sources deviate from the literal interpretation of Num:– . (ACG) 20606. E.

This bibliographic essay, which focuses more or less on the past two decades, begins with a brief survey of general resources on Philo, including bibliogra- phies, journals, series, monographs, and internet sites. After a consideration of some research trends, the discussion turns to studies of Philo as a Jew. In con- trast to the mid-twentieth century, when the center of scholarly concern was whether Philo was more fundamentally a Jew or a Greek, the more recent stud- ies approach him from several different perspectives. These include describ- ing Philo’s Judaism (‘the descriptive approach’); studying how he balances Jew- ish and universal elements (‘the thematic approach’); comparing his writings with other traditions (‘the comparative approach’); observing how he shapes his presentations of Jews and Judaism to impress his readers (‘the presentational approach’); and considering Philo’s attitudes toward others and examining the relationship between his exegetical and historical writings (‘the socio-political approach’). The essay concludes with a discussion of studies of Philo within broader historical contexts, a summary of current trends, and suggestions for future directions.

Both Rom :– and Rev :– are seen as a crime-and-punishment list, comparable to Philo’s Flacc. –. Rom :–: is another way of reporting on crime and punishment in the form of a story.

Borgen argues that both Rom :– and :–: reveal how Paul transforms traditional Jewish understanding of the relationship between Jews andnon-Jews: Jesus Christ did not die for his own sins but for ‘our sins’. The passages thus expound the crime story of humankind in texts having the form of crime-and- punishment reports about Jesus Christ. (TS) 20608. P.

In setting out to analyse some crime-and-punishment reports, the author chooses to discuss first the Philonic example Flacc. –; then further exam- ples follow in JosephusWar .–, Macc :–:, and Acts :–. His main points of focus are on what is seen as the basic principles for evaluating the crimes committed: is the perspective extra-mural, concerning the relations between Jews and non-Jews? Or are there intra-mural aspects present? Based upon his findings he suggests that there are reasons to ask whether the form of crime-and-punishment reports should be classified as a genre of its own, distinct from biographies. Furthermore, if so, one might ask whether the Gospel of John as well as the Gospel of Mark follows the structure of crime-and-punishment reports. (TS) 20609. P. R. Bosman, ‘Conscience and Free Speech in Philo,’ The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The word συνειδ ς (conscience), which occurs  times in Philo’s writings, has a predominantly negative connotation: having a ‘conscience’ means having a ‘guilty awareness’. The conscience, which is a component of the soul, can be regarded as the inner court of law and acts as a prosecutor and admonisher. Philo combines ‘conscience’ with ‘free speech’ (παρρησ α). It is only possible to speak freely if one has a clear conscience. Both a pure conscience and freedom of speech result from living virtuously. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="354">  part two 20610.

In asking ‘how did early Christian monasticism receive the ascetic and spiri- tual traditions of Judaism and their wider Greco-Roman world,’ the author deals with Philo’s Therapeutae as portrayed in Contempl. on pp. –. He himself is of the opinion that the Therapeutae did not actually exist; hence there is no possibility of a continuous ascetic or monastic tradition in Egypt from the st to the th century.He is also skeptical about any influence of Philo’s literary portrait of the Therapeutae on early Christian monasticism.

Philo is the main source for technical terms in the whole ancient Greek literature. His writings feature the largest collection of  γ&lt;ν metaphors of all Greek authors. Indeed, many metaphors are so detailed and precise that they provide a detailed reconstruction of the rules and practices of the competitions. On the presumption that he and his family did indeed hold full civil rights, Philo would have passed through the ephebe education himself, which in turn fits the description in Spec. .. In this way he could address his writings to both Jews and non-Jews, for he hoped that the non-Jewish would follow the superior laws of Israel in the future (seeMos. .f.). Philo picks upCynicmotifs and integrates them with Stoic elements in a worldview which is marked by Platonic ideas. This is the way that Philo presents his ‘conquest’ of Hellenistic culture, which is regarded as being based on Jewish writings and is counted as its heritage. This is the reason that the Israelite ‘athletes of virtue’ are able to accomplish typical Greek ideals. On the other hand, the theocentric worldview which shows the  γDν εupsilonlenisσε ε ας as the service for God links Philo to Stoic conceptions. He acknowledges the idea that humans depend on God’s grace (see Deus ). Making reference to Plato, Philo differs from Paul’s use of the metaphor of the crown and the prize of victory ()  αρτ ς/  αρτ4ς στ  αν ς, Cor :). (GS) 20612. M.

Fictive sexuality is an important point of reference in the relation- ship between man and God, corresponding to sensuous and physical love in asceticism. Nevertheless this asceticism opposes the principle of so-called pro- creationism. Sexual reproduction becomes compulsory and provides a kind of residuum for lust and desire.

To study the Wirkungsgeschichte (reception history) of LXX Psalms in Jew- ish and Christian sources, the author devotes sections to Maccabees, Philo (pp. –), Josephus, Greco-Roman writings (in an excursus), Gospels, Paul, other NT writings, Apostolic Fathers, Apologists, and Greek Fathers. The focus is on quotations and indirect allusions to Psalms and questions of author, genre, and canonicity. Philo includes several Psalm quotations as well as references to other biblical songs. For the authors of Psalms Philo speaks of associates of Moses, employs locutions like ‘the divine man’ or ‘a prophetic man,’ and uses the passive voice, as in ‘it is said.’ Because of the traditional ascription of Psalmic authorship to David, of which Philo is aware (Conf. ), it is striking that he associates the Psalter with associates of Moses instead of with David. This asso- ciation can be understood when one recalls that Moses is Philo’s hero. (EB) 20615. S. Y. Chan, Timothy :– in the Light of Views concerning Eve and Childbirth in Early Judaism (diss.

The author argues that Philo’s exceptional reference to the book of Jeremiah in Cher.  can be explained on the assumption that he used an esoteric com- mentary by ‘Jeremiah’.This commentary is said to have been composed inGreek, as reflected in LXX Jer :, and also influenced passages in the medieval book of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, and the Babylonian Talmud, which show, in her view, a general resemblance to Philo’s interpretation. In this way the author hopes to give further support to the earlier thesis of Samuel Belkin that there are direct connections between Philo and the Zohar. (MRN) 20618. N. G.

Assuming that the prophetic books were widely available in Greek by the time of Philo, the author addresses the problem of why they are so sparsely quoted in Philo’s works. She argues that his references echo the liturgical use of the prophets as Haftarah in Alexandria. This argument is supported by three separate considerations: () reviewing material already published in  (see above ), Cohen lists all the prophetic quotations as well as possible allu- sions to them and compares them to the Haftarot read between  of Tam- muz and Yom Kippur, which are attested much later in sources from the Land of Israel; () on the basis of a close reading of Conf.– she argues for Philo’s use of a Hebrew lexical concordance written in Greek; () she suggests that Philo’s references to ‘the friends of Moses’ and the school of Moses can be identified as a group of contemporary Alexandrian Jews, who were alle- gorists and favoured non-Pentateuchal passages. It is from these circles, Cohen suggests, that he received exegesis of passages not included in the Pentateuch. (MRN) 20619. I.

Philo’s Contempl. presents ‘the earliest liturgical use of the term antiphônos’ (p. ). One author maintains that Philo’s understanding of this term reflects responses to a soloist rather than the alternation of choirs responding to each </page> <page sequence="357"> critical studies   other; the latter sense combines ancient meanings of the term as ‘reply’ and ‘octave.’ Coleman believes, however, that in the context in which Philo uses  ντ  ων ς—namely, the antiphonal singing of the male and female choirs in imitation ofmale and female singing at the Red Sea in Exod —the term indeed carries the sense of choirs singing in response to each other. In this learned consideration of Philo’s treatise, Coleman suggests that in equating the male and female choirs, theTherapeutae displayed a unique interpretation of Exod , that the Therapeutic musical practices were based on the choral singing in Greek drama, and that Philo’s account of Therapeutic liturgical practices influenced later Christian ones. Coleman also argues that the group was probably real rather than imaginary, because it is otherwise difficult to understand Philo’s motivation in presenting such a detailed account, the equality of men and women is not characteristic of Philo, and the common Egyptian provenience of the Therapeutae and later Christian monastics may explain the influence of the Therapeutae on later Christian practices.

DeConick (ed.), Paradise Now: Essays on Early Jewish and ChristianMysticism, Society of Biblical Literature Symposium Series  (Atlanta ) –. Philo may have intended his treatise Contempl. to serve different apologetic functions for Jewish and non-Jewish readers and it may have provided him with an opportunity ‘to reflect on his own experience as philosopher and text worker’ (p. ). Central to the life of the Therapeutic community is ‘text work’, which includes interpretation of Scripture and composition of hymns and relates to both ritual and mystical experience. Using language evocative of priests and Levites on one hand, and ascent, vision, and ecstasy on the other, Philo highlights the community’s ritual and mystical aspects. His discussion of space—which moves from the inhabited world through regional and local sites toward the interior of the individual members’ dwellings—suggests the interiority of the allegorical meaning of the text as studied by individuals and community alike. Philo’s description of the community’s simple lifestyle and religious gatherings, in which text study is a focus, similarly emphasizes the ritual and mystical aspects of the group. Although parallels exist between the Therapeutic community and Greek philosophers, mystery religion devotees, and practitioners of Egyptian temple religion, Philo presents the ways of the Therapeutic community as superior.

In Philo’s exegetical method,  upsilonacuteσις occupies a significant place. The author rejects the view that in Philo  υσι λ γ α is synonymous with ‘allegorical inter- pretation’. As a philosophical term the adverb  υσικ=ς refers to a manner of </page> <page sequence="358">  part two reasoning that is proper to the study of physics. In Jewish exegetes,  υσικ=ς indicates the philosophical rationale behindMoses’ words. The scope of physics has expanded and also incorporates metaphysics. In the Greek philosophical tradition,  υσι λ γ α refers to the examination of the phenomena in heaven and the genesis of the universe. This same meaning is found in Philo, for whom the study of the cosmos leads ultimately to knowledge of God the creator. (ACG) 20622. S. DiMattei, ‘Paul’s Allegory of TwoCovenants (Gal. .–) in Light of First-Century Hellenistic Rhetoric and Jewish Hermeneutic,’ New Testament Studies  () –. Philo’s works and views play a relatively minor role in this study. The author considers Philo’s allegories to be apologetic rather than expository, and that Paul’s usage thus does not square with Philo’s apologetic (p. ). On the other hand, the term λληγ ρ ω is predominately used by both authors in the sense ‘to speak allegorically.’ In the rest of the study the author argues that Paul’s allegory is more reflective of Jewish practices which sought to eschatologize the Torah by reading Gen : through its haftarah, Isa :.

The author concludes that the closest literary antecedents for the first two images can be found in the literary world of Hellenistic Jewish wisdom speculation, specif- ically that subset of Hellenistic Jewish wisdom speculation influenced by Mid- dle Platonic thought and exemplified by the works of Philo of Alexandria. The third image, that of Christ the Incarnate god, finds its most compelling literary antecedents inworks ofGreco-Roman religious thought and philosophy, specifi- cally thosemythswhich deal with gods taking human form and serving as slaves. The image of the god as flesh, a subset of those images which deal with Christ as an incarnate god, however, fails to be easily classified as deriving from either Hellenistic Jewish or Greco-Roman literary images. It is an image which had to have arisen from early Christian kerygma. (DTR; based on author’s summary in DA) 20624. L. H. Feldman, Judaism and Hellenism Reconsidered (Leiden ).

While the label ‘rewritten Bible’ may describe aspects of ancient Jewish lit- erary activity, some Hellenistic Jewish works may also be understood in rela- tion to the Greco-Roman literary practice of imitatio, based on the foremost model of Homer; for Jews, Moses’ Pentateuch became such a model. Discus- sions of the high priestly vestments, based on Exod , reflect the imitation of ekphrasis, the vivid description of various phenomena including works of art, whose classic example is Homer’s description of Achilles’ shield (Il. .– ). Imitations of ekphrasis can be found in the Letter of Aristeas – and Ben Sira :–. Ben Sira :– on the high priest Simon imitates the encomium. Philo provides examples of allegorical ekphrasis in QE .–, Spec. .–, and Mos. .–. Focusing on the last passage, Fernández- Marcos shows how Philo blends Platonic and Stoic thinking to portray the high priestly vestments as symbolic of the universe and the high priest him- self as a small universe, or microcosm. In BJ .– and Ant. .–, Josephus, who uses different terms for the vestments, shows variations on the symbolic ekphrasis found in Philo. All these examples suggest that Hellenistic Jewish writers were very interested in the theme of the high priestly vestments and that the tradition of interpretation of these vestments was fairly widespread. (EB) 20626. E. Filler, Dialectic in Philo (diss. Bar-Ilan University, Ramat- Gan ). This dissertation seeks to examine whether, besides the known and exten- sive influence of such Platonic writings as the Timaeus on Philo’s writings and thought, we can also detect traces of the dialectics of the later Platonic dialogues. The result is patently negative. Most of the dissertation is devoted to explaining the lack of such dialectical terminology. Initially, the possibility of Stoic influence is examined and dismissed. Subsequently, the author asks whether Philo may have been attached to a Sophistic movement in Alexandria and what his atti- tude to such amovement may precisely have been. Analyzing the occurrences of terms connected to ‘sophists’, the author highlights the wide span of their mean- ings as well as Philo’s ambivalence. As comparative material from Alexandria is missing, it is not clear whether it is Philo’s original contribution to contrast the Sophist in this broad way to the true philosopher. Moreover, the author argues that one of Philo’s proofs for the harm engendered by sophistic teachings and </page> <page sequence="360">  part two instruction is that their inner convictions contradict their spoken declarations. They befittingly preach onmatters of ethics, but they fail to implement those very splendid concepts. Here Philo raises an idea which might be original. Authentic philosophy must foster full accord between thinking, will and deed. The con- trast between speech and deed (λ γ ς–:ργ ν) is common and acceptable within Greek literature, though the concept of will (  upsilonacuteλευσις,   υλεupsilonacuteματα) appears to be derived from the biblical idea of divine will and of human free will. In adopting philosophical concepts as ancillary to his exposition of theTorah, Philo is not prepared to accept the technical aspects of philosophy, mainly dialectic, since then one begins to appear as a recipient of a science through which truth becomes attainable, when in fact truth has been exclusively encapsulated within Mosaic Law. Be that as it may, logic has its place and can, within limits, even be to human advantage. It should be remembered that one can easily err within it, and mislead by using it, and it is capable of upsetting the understanding of nature, as it may impair the understanding of ethics. It is therefore preferable to avoid dialectic (except for argumentation with the Sophists). The work ends with a biographical hypothesis, according to which it is possible that Philo himself was harshly castigated in his youth in a debate with one of those very Sophists, or had witnessed the defeat of a person whom he respected.

The  occurrences of the term 8σ τηςwhich one encounters in Philo’s œuvre demonstrates the quantitative but also the qualitative importance that Philo accords to the principle of equality, which occupies a place at all the levels of reality. In order to evaluate the specific elements of his thought on the concept, the author examines in succession the Greek background which Philo inherited, the two passages in his writings that are directly focused on isotês (Her. –, Spec. .–), his utlilization of two concepts linked to equality, democracy and isonomia, and the practical problems associated with its application to society. From the viewpoint of the creator, equality is the principle of unity and balance. Within the cosmos it is associated with the democratic model. It enters not so much in political reflection as in the interpretation of the succession of empires, where it establishes an equilibrium throughout the ages, and also in reflection on social relations, where it recalls the original unity of humanity.This is the reason that the concept is dear to the Therapeutae and the Essenes, who are keen to live as closely as possible to the law of nature.

This book examines, first, how early Jewish literature interprets Israel’s exile and restoration and the fate of other nations at the time of this restoration and, second, how Luke-Acts uses or modifies these interpretations. Fuller discerns several patterns in early Jewish literature that include a literal understanding of Jewish return to the land of Israel; an inter-Jewish understanding, whereby a subset of Israel is given prominence among the wider Jewish community; an emphasis on the re-gathering of the twelve tribes; and a spiritualized interpreta- tion, inwhich the literalmeaning of restoration disappears or diminishes greatly. Differing emphases are placed upon divine intervention and the role of the mes- siah. The fate of the nations may be viewed locally with respect to the land or cosmically with respect to the eschaton; and some sources see a positive role for the nations. Drawing upon some of these motifs, Luke–Acts emphasizes Jesus as the Davidic messiah in Israel, later enthroned in heaven; the twelve Apostles as leaders of eschatological Israel; and incorporation of other nations and enemies who also remain bound to the land of Israel. Paul goes beyond the restoration of Israel to proclaim God’s kingdom in the Roman Empire and ultimately in Paradise. Philo sees the role of the Jews in the Diaspora positively as coloniz- ers rather than exiles. Based on the important distinction between his use of ‘Israel’ and ‘Jews’, Fuller claims that Philo understands restoration symbolically as a return of all virtuous people to wisdom or God and that the physical aspect is less important than the spiritual or allegorical one.

Philo’s understanding of the τupsilonacuteπ ι of the Holy tent and the tent itself revealed to Moses differs greatly from the one in Hebrews. This is the reason that the specific form of the archetype-image relation in Hebrews cannot be deduced from contemporary Greek thought, i.e. Middle Platonism. Philo only refers </page> <page sequence="362">  part two once, in Spec. .ff., to the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary (Num ). However, the discussion about cleansing water is found several times. Even if Philo is aware of such claims and rituals for the ordinary domestic sphere, his focus lies on the explanation of the sprinkling of cleansing water as a precondition for the admission to the temple and for participation in the cult. At the same time, extrinsic and inner cleansing—denoting ethical and spiritual purification—and forgiveness of sins are inextricably linked together. (GS) 20631. A. C.

Short presentation of some examples of Philo’s influence on the Church fathers Origen, Clement, and Gregory of Nyssa. Both Clement and Origen take over, for example, Philo’s allegorical exegesis of Hagar and Sarah. Gregory of Nyssa stands in the same tradition of negative theology as Philo. This is evidenced by their common interpretation of the darkness in Exod : as referring to God’s incomprehensibility. (ACG) 20632. A. C.

The author discusses Philo’s interpretation of God’s appearance to Moses in the burning bush (Exod ). God’s words ‘I am He-who-is’ indicates that God’s essence consists in being, and that his nature cannot be expressed in words. God is thus unnameable and incomprehensible. In his description of the burning bush Gregory of Nyssa makes use of Philo’s narrative. According to his interpretation the words ‘I am He-who-is’ are spoken by God the Son. For him both God the Father and God’s Logos, Christ, can be called   3ν. In this way he differs from Philo, who regards God’s Logos as standing on a lower ontological level than God and as subordinated to God. (ACG) 20633. M.

The author discusses Philo’s explanation of the Sabbath offerings (Spec. .– ), of the New Moon (§§–) and of the Passover offerings (§§– ) in the context of the interpretation of the offerings of the Sabbath (Num –) in the Damascus Document. According to Philo, the Sabbath offering is instead of the weekly Tamid offering. Heger concludes that according to the Damascus Document, the weekday offering should not be offered on Sabbath, being replaced by the particular Sabbath offerings.

He agrees that Kerkeslager makes a good case that they were not directly involved. Nevertheless the argument has various weaknesses that should be pointed out. For example, even though they may have been physically absent, their influence was most likely still very strong. (DTR) 20643. S.

The topic of most significance for Philonic studies is the argument that neither Jews in Egypt nor their Gentile Christian sympathizers could have survived the revolt to pass on the works and ideas of Philo to the later Christian communities in Egypt. From this and various sources dating to after the revolt in – it is argued that the copies of Philo’s works and related Philonic ideas that circulated inEgypt after the revolt weremost likely introduced byChristians who imported them from other regions in which Philo’s works already had been circulating before the revolt. There are no direct continuities between Philonic Jewish groups in Egypt before the revolt and the later Philonizing Christian groups in Egypt after the revolt.

Philo emphasizes Moses’ virtues and goes so far as to attribute divine qualities to him. Some questions considered and debated by scholars include Philo’s audience for the treatise on Moses, Philo’s claim about the influence of Moses on Greek culture, Philo’s own borrowing fromGreek culture in his portrayal of Moses andMosaic Law, Philo’s fashioning of Moses for his own purposes, the human or divine origin of Moses’ powers, and Philo’s understanding of prophecy. (EB) 20649. J. Klawans, Purity, Sacrifice, and the Temple: Symbolism and Supersessionism in the Study of Ancient Judaism (Oxford ). Contemporary religious and cultural biases have led modern scholars to misconstrue or misrepresent ancient Israelite, Jewish, and Christian stances toward the Temple cult. These scholars have separated the study of purity and sacrifice, which belong together, and have understood purity but not sacrifice to have a spiritualized significance for the ancient practitioners. Scholars have also understood sacrifice as a primitive form of worship later replaced by better, more acceptable forms. To point out and counter these scholarly understandings, Klawans examines purity and sacrifice in biblical Israel (Part I) and approaches to the Temple cult in Second Temple literature, rabbinic literature, and the New Testament (Part II). Ancient Israelites viewed sacrifice as an act of imitatio Dei aimed at bringing God’s presence into the sanctuary. Philo ‘may well present the first truly integrated interpretation of the entire sacrificial process, beginning with ritual and moral purification’ (p. ). His approach to this process— what Klawans terms ‘the most sustained and sophisticated analysis of purity and sacrifice in ancient Jewish literature’ (p. )—is sympathetic and combines symbolic and practical discussions. Some of Philo’s views may be unique to him but they also show continuities with earlier views, particularly ‘that the temple represents the cosmos and the priests serve as its angelic caretakers’ (p. ). (EB) 20650. D. Konstan, ‘Philo’s De virtutibus in the Perspective of Classi- cal Greek Philosophy,’The Studia Philonica Annual  () –. The article discusses various themes relating to Philo’s analysis of the virtues inVirt., with special emphasis on his treatment of two principal virtues, courage ( νδρε α) and humanity ( ιλαν ρωπ α). Humanity is a newcomer to the clas- sical list of virtues. Philo gives it a special place in Virt., showing that Moses extends this virtue, which is closely related to gentleness and mildness, not only to human beings but also to animals. Like Plato, Philo defines courage as a kind of knowledge, and following Aristotle he regards it as the middle way between rashness and cowardice. Practisers of wisdom, who are full of proud thoughts, are said to exercise true courage. This kind of connection between wisdom and courage does not occur in Greek philosophy. The same applies to the view that confidence in God’s aid as a result of piety can simply be identified with courage. (ACG) </page> <page sequence="368">  part two 20651. E.

The author presents and briefly discusses Philo’s references to persons in classical drama. He finds that Philo mentions several dramas, and although he seldom names the plays or the author, almost all of his references can be identified as belonging to dramas from which we have at least fragments. Philo mentions Sophocles once (Prob. ); quotes Ion once (Prob. ); mentions Aeschylus twice (Prob. , Aet. ); and Euripides often. Menander is quoted, but not mentioned by name. In addition, Philo several times also reveals his knowledge about theatres. Koskenniemi’s conclusion is that Philo was deeply committed to the world of the theatre, that he quoted frommemory, and that he often used the dramatists to underscore points in his expositions of the Torah.

Haak (edd.), Prophets, Prophecy, and Prophetic Texts in Second Temple Judaism (London ) –. Despite a recent consensus that Jews in antiquity believed that prophecy had ceased with the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, several Jewish texts from the Second Temple period suggest that such a belief was not universal. While some modern writers try to distinguish between biblical prophecy and later prophetic experiences, Philo’s autobiographical accounts of his own expe- rience of inspiration when he is interpreting Scripture are quite similar to his accounts of prophetic inspiration and even ofMoses’ prophetic experience. Sim- ilarities betweenPhilo’s description of prophetic experience and of his own expe- rience include sudden inspiration, loss of awareness of one’s surroundings, and extraordinary insight. Similarities between Philo’s description of Moses’ expe- rience as a prophet and of Philo’s own experiences as an exegete include two forms of inspiration, through divine possession and an inner prompting of the soul. In contrast to the earlier consensus, then, Philo is an invaluable witness to the notion ‘that prophecy has not ceased, that the divine spirit has notwithdrawn from Israel’ (p. ).

Having shown thatmany contradictory points of view have been stated on the subject of the passions in Philo, the author focuses on four points: the different Philonic conceptions of the soul; the typologies and representations of passion; the problem of therapy; and finally what appears to be the Philonic paradox par excellence, passion transcended by folly. It appears that Philo expresses himself sometimes in Platonic terms, sometimes in Stoic terms, depending on the text on which he is commenting, but also depending on convictions that never coincide, so to speak, with specific philosophical doctrines.

DeConick (ed.), Paradise Now: Essays on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, Society of Biblical Literature Symposium Series  (Atlanta ) –. Cultic sacrificial meals and eschatological or heavenly banquets reflect both community boundaries and divine–human boundaries. The author consid- ers various representations of these meals in Philo, Epistle to the Hebrews, Luke, John, and rabbinic literature. According to Philo’s interpretations of Exod :—especially in QE—Moses, Aaron, and the  elders ascend to an immor- tal, divine place; the food is spiritual rather than physical; and the vision of the divine unifies Israel, a nation that also partakes of the spiritual food of manna. Philo similarly assigns spiritual meaning to sacrificial practices, in which seeing God becomes ‘the culminating moment of the rite’ (p. ). Even while the Temple is standing Philo turns sacrifice into an internal, spiritual rite and thereby legitimates a pious life away from this Temple. In NT sources, accounts of Jesus and meal symbolism point to ‘a collapsing of the bound- aries that had formerly structured humanity’s relationship to the divine; and [by contrast] in rabbinic sources, the eschatological meal provides a model for the divine-human encounter that necessitates the maintenance of the very boundaries that are challenged in the emergent Christian tradition’ (p. ).

The study focuses on the early Jewish history of reception of one of the narrative climaxes of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the story of the worship of the golden calf image described in Exod . Because of the controversial nature of the story, it played an interesting role in religious debates in the early centuries of our era, which can be followed in some detail. Several textual corpora are studied, the most important of which are firstly the Hellenistic- Jewish authors Philo and Josephus and the pseudepigraphic Pseudo-Philo, all of them from the st century c.e., secondly the Aramaic translations of the Pentateuch (targums) and thirdly the vast rabbinic corpus fromMishna until the final redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, including the numerous midrashic works. The study may thus be categorized as a contribution to the field of the study of midrash, broadly speaking, and secondarily as a study in the religious confrontation of the early centuries.

Lindquist here discusses three different authors’ versions of the so-called ‘golden calf episode.’ The authors dealt with are Philo, Josephus and Ps.Philo (LAB). According to Lindquist these authors represent two different perspec- tives: Philo and Josephus deal with Judaism in contact and conflict with for- eign cults, culture and civilization; Pseudo-Philo represents a kind of introverted Judaism, without traces of intercultural encounters. He then deals extensively with the more literal exposition in Philo’sMos. .–, but comments rather briefly on the more allegorical treatments of Ebr. –, –, Post. –, Sacr. – and Fug. –. He finds that Philo presents Moses in line with the aretalogies of Hellenistic literature, and that his noble character, as well as the exemplary victory of the Levites over the wrong, are the focal points of this episode.

In his discussion of the Coptic treatise of Nag Hammadi, Prôtennoia trimor- phê, which is a translation of a Greek original, the author investigates a number </page> <page sequence="371"> critical studies   of Greek terms which are concealed behind Coptic expressions, namely Y1&lt;,  ων  and λ γ ς. In attempting to determine how this triad could be used in the context of the history of salvation, the author states that it is necessary to find an author who explains how one can move from the literal to the figurative sense of the words.This leads one to an author who gladly makes use of allegory, such as Philo. A reading of Philo’s allegorical treatises makes clear that the triad sound–voice–speech, which has its origin in Stoic grammatical analysis, has been utilized by the Alexandrian for the purposes of his exegesis.

The article offers an analysis of Philo’s use and interpretation of terms related to the mystery cults, notably μυστ ρι ν, @ργια and τελετ , starting with a brief survey of the status quaestionis. While Philo’s judgement of the mysteries as idolatrous and immoral rituals based on mythical fictions and falsehoods is nothing but negative, this does not preclude his using mystery terms with reference to the Judaic religion. While Judaism for Philo represented the only authentic religion, with rites of universalistic significance, this study argues that themysteries, inasmuch as their aimwas divine illumination, in the eyes of Philo allowed for a positive interpretation in philosophical terms, i.e. symbolizing initiation of the soul into the noetic realm.

A section is devoted to Philo’s writings in which several prayers spoken by women alone are analysed, namely the prayers of Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, Hagar, Miriam and the women’s choir, the Therapeutae, and women offering prayers at the Temple. The author concludes that these prayers in Philo show patterns similar to prayers in other writings. Although the theology of Philo’s works is different from the other documents, the prayers demonstrate similar patterns in content, form, and social location.

This article examines some aspects of the composition of Philo’sMos., espe- cially the way in which Philo deals with his main source, the Septuagint. The author discerns several techniques, the most important of which is his adap- tion of the biblical text. Philo rewrites the text in words that are an echo of the biblical verses. In most circumstances Philo elaborates on what he finds in the Bible. On a few occasions, however, he makes an abridgment of the biblical narrative. Although allegory does not fit very well into a retelling of Moses’ life, occasionally Philo offers an allegorical interpretation. A strange fea- ture is that Philo avoids the use of proper names with the exception of Moses himself. An appendix presents an overview of the structure of the treatise. (ACG) 20664. S.

The author discerns Philo’s influence in Eusebius’ notion of the patriarchs as images of virtue and models for a virtuous life. But in contrast to Philo the Church father does not explain their lives allegorically. The lives are just illus- trations of virtue and Eusebius’ reading remains on a literal level. Furthermore the term ε8κ&lt;ν has also the connotation of ‘example’, which is absent in Philo. (ACG) 20665. N.

BesidesAristobulus andAristeas, Philo ismentioned as an example of Jewish- Hellenistic interpretation of the Bible, esp. Opif., Leg. and Mos. The common ground of the method of allegorical interpretation is that a hidden meaning exists below the surface of the text, which can be extracted through extensive investigation. In this sense Philo, for example, interprets the two trees in the Garden of Eden (Gen ) in an ethical way (Opif. ). In addition, linguistic parallels in the technique of queries and interpretation exist, as well as the notion that both Homer and Moses allude to various philosophical ideas (see Luke :). In this way the author gives support to his thesis that Luke uses the technical terminology of Hellenistic allegoresis in interpreting his Bible (see Luke :). This shows that he is in accordance with the tradition represented in particular by Philo. (GS) </page> <page sequence="373"> critical studies   20666. M. R.

There are also some remarks on the agricultural imagery applied to the cosmos in Plant. In Neoplatonism the ideas of divine tools were replaced by the notion of procession.

He also wants to interpret his life. His interpretation takes the form of an exegetical explication on two levels, the literal and the allegorical.

Ch.  examinesMatt :–. It is argued that its redaction is grounded in a specific tradition of prayers of thanksgiving listing individual parts of creation such as are found in Philo, particularly in Spec. . Ch.  presents Sacr. – as the clear Philonic parallel for Matt :– and in particular its main theme of reward for labour. Various aspects of this text are discussed, including Matthew’s use of numerals. Ch.  turns to :– and its theme of the entry of vice in the place vacated by good, for which an astonishing number of Philonic parallels can be given. Chapter six examines Philonic parallels for Matt :– and in particular the use of the Greek term Z upsilonacuteς for the keenness of vision and the mind.The final two chapters present the conclusions of the study and a full- length summary.There is no general bibliography, but extensive lists of literature are presented at the end of each chapter.

Although Athens and Rome were the leading cities in the classical world, Alexandria, a city with ‘a unique soul’ (p. xv) greatly deserves recognition for its impressive contributions, preserved in writing, to many fields of knowl- edge. Declaring Alexandria to be ‘the greatest mental crucible the world has ever known’ (p. xix), the authors bring the ancient city to life in their vivid account of people, events, and ideas from the founding of the city in  b.c.e. to the Muslim conquest in  c.e. Philo’s writings offer a flavor of the city and its political turbulence under Rome. Philo himself was devoted to </page> <page sequence="375"> critical studies   comparing Jewish and Greek tradition, and he saw Moses as ‘the original per- ceiver of divine wisdom’ (p. ), whose teachings underlay Greek philosophy. Philo’s efforts, and especially his concept of the Logos, inadvertently provided the philosophical foundation of Christianity; and the Essenes and Therapeu- tae, whom he described, may have been models for early Christian monastic groups. While one should appreciate the authors’ great enthusiasm for their subject, readers may notice that the section on Philo contains mistaken ref- erences and some assertions that should have been stated more tentatively.

This study on the relationship between Philo and the Stoics leads to the con- clusion that Philo cannot be considered a ‘neutral’ source for Stoic thought, given the fact that the texts on which he draws undergo both an exegetical and a philo- sophical adaptation: exegetical inasmuch as Philo is bound to take into consider- ation the biblical narrative; philosophical inasmuch as Philo’s perspective is of a transcendent, Platonic nature.Once aware of this ‘deformation’, and havingmade the necessary corrections of perspective, we can conclude, however, that in none of the examined passages (Opif. , Sacr. , Leg. ., Opif. , Migr. , Opif.  f., Conf. , Spec. .) does Philo violate the Stoic substance of his sources. This is because the foundation of Philo’s allegorical method is essentially Stoic (e.g. the unity and ‘many ways of being’ of God, cf. the theory of the powers).

In commenting on the fragment on the Sabbath the author mentions various Philonic texts which are close to the thought of Aristobulus. (JR) 20675. D. G.

Wide-ranging article which analyses and problematizes Philo’s pronounce- ments on mind and language against the background of contemporary Platonist and Stoic doctrine. Particular emphasis is placed on the interplay of immaterial- ity and materiality in Philo’s concept of the human logos. The two kinds of logos in human beings are paralleled by a distinction in the cosmic realm, in which there is a higher, divine logos and also logos as cosmic principle. Robertson is struck by a new emphasis on divine speech in Philo which has biblical roots. Turning to the theme of essence and nature of mind, he notes the stubborn ten- dency shown by Philo to view the connection of thought and language in terms of a contrast between the physical and the immaterial, the logos being seen as an intermediary between the two.The difficulty then arises of the interface between the two, for example in how corporeal speech carries incorporeal meaning. In this view spoken language comes to be regarded as inferior, but Philo likes the idea that the inferior part of something can be joined together with the superior part, i.e. audible word and intelligible thought. The background of these ideas might be thought to be Stoic (esp. the doctrine of ‘sayables’), but there are sev- eral points at which Philo introduces Platonist ideas, and he appears to antic- ipate the later Neoplatonic distinction between discursive and non-discursive thought.

As part of a seminar on the treatise Virt., Royse examines the textual basis of the work as presented in the critical edition of C-W, building on earlier work done by Hilgert (RRS ) and Runia (RRS ). The treatise is clearly a kind of appendix to the four books of Spec., but it seems that Philo himself did not make the organization of the various sub-treatises very clear and this is reflected in their transmission. A discussion follows on the original title of the work and the arrangement of its various parts. Fortunately the order as found in the Seldenianus manuscript (S) is confirmed by the early evidence of Clement of Alexandria. Another problem raised by our evidence is whether there may have been a lost section of the work entitled Περ  εupsilonlenisσε ε ας (De pietate). Royse offers arguments that we should take the evidence of the Sacra parallela seriously on this point. In addition there is some intriguing evidence about this postulated lost work in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus, which is discussed at some length. Royse then turns to some of the fascinating deviant readings furnished by ms. S which </page> <page sequence="377"> critical studies   can be explained by various kinds of scribal intervention. Recently a further witness for the text has been discovered in the form of a Vienna papyrus, but its evidence is very limited. Finally brief remarks are devoted to the question of whether Philo’s works were revised by a Jewish-Rabbinic scribe. Royse briefly discusses the biblical text quoted at Virt.  and concludes that there is little doubt that the text here is influenced by Aquila’s translation of the HebrewBible. (DTR) 20677. D. T.

He claimed that Mark was written in a way similar to how Philo interpreted the biblical narratives about the lives and journeys of Moses and Abraham, arguing that Philo’s biographies are allegorical presentations of the identity of the Jewish people, and that Mark is an allegory of a similar kind. The present article questions Tronier’s interpretation of Philo, e.g. by urging a dis- tinction between the biography of Moses and those of Abraham. Furthermore, the author argues that Mark’s Gospel is narrative and not expository like Philo’s Abr.andMigr. (TS) 20679. G.

After presenting a brief review of much discussed issues relating to magic, religion and society, the author makes a comparison of the Philonic and Septu- agintal vocabulary of magic. Then he deals more explicitly with Philo’s picture of Balaam as a magician. He finds that Philo’s picture of Balaam is complex. On the one hand, Philo has to cope with the biblical and related traditions about the great prophecies of Balaam. On the other hand, once he is released from his prophetic possession, Balaam is and remains for Philo a magical diviner. (TS) 20683. P. D.

InPhilo’s thought piety (εupsilonlenisσ  εια) holds a prominent place. InVirt. it receives separate treatment. It has become the cardinal virtue and he calls it ‘the queen of virtues’ and the ‘leading’ and ‘greatest virtue’. It refers to the human response to and perception of God. Piety has an intellectual component and Philo uses it in the context of the humanunderstanding ofGod.UnlikeHellenistic philosophers who subordinate piety to justice (δικαι σupsilonacuteνη) or another virtue, Philo regards piety as a source for all other virtues. The reason for this prominent place can be found in Philo’s theism. Just as God is the supreme source of all that exists, so is piety the source of the virtues. Philo is led to this understanding by his attempt to view his ancestral religion as a form of philosophy. (ACG) 20685. G. J.

Punt (edd.),TheNew Testa- ment Interpreted: Essays in Honour of Bernard C. Lategan, Supplements to Novum Testamentum  (Leiden ) –. Certain Torah quotations are common to Philo, to the unknown author of Hebrews and to some of the early Church Fathers. These quotations represent a similar reading in the different groups of literature, which in some instances jointly differ from the reading in the LXX. One is thus confronted with the question: what is the common denominator? The possibilities explored in this paper include (a) the common Hellenistic milieu, (b) literary interdependence upon each other, (c) independent use of a ‘testimony book’, (d) sharing the same oral tradition, (e) independent use of a commonVorlage in the literary tradition, (f) the role of a Christian editorial hand, and (g) geographical proximity of the authors. It is argued that the answer to this question is probably to be found not in any single possibility, but rather in a combination of some of these. With regard to the Torah quotations it is suggested that the author of Hebrews wrote from Alexandria to Christians in Rome and, being familiar with the works of Philo, made use of Philo’s Torah tradition. Clement of Rome and Justin Martyr both wrote later from Rome and, being familar with the work of Hebrews, made use of his tradition in turn. (DTR; based on author’s summary) 20686. T.

He places the intelligible world in the divine Logos as the creative power of God, and by regarding the intelligible world as contents of God’s thought he gives it an ontologically lower status than God. This seems a result of Philo’s reading of Timaeus from his own point of view. Although his interpretation of the creation of human beings is not coherent, Philo makes clear that their status derives from being the image of God on account of the human intellect and suggests the possibility of ascending from the sensible world to the intelligible world and ultimately to God.

While Pontius Pilate is often seen as agnostic, in modern terms, the mate- rial evidence of his coinage and the Pilate inscription from Caesarea indicate a prefect determined to promote a form of Roman religion in Judaea. Unlike his predecessors, in the coinage Pilate used peculiarly Roman iconographic ele- ments appropriate to the imperial cult. In the inscription Pilate was evidently responsible for dedicating a Tiberieum to the Dis Augustis. This material evi- dence may be placed alongside the report in Philo Legat. – where Pilate sets up shields, an action that is likewise associated with the Roman imperial cult honouring Tiberius in Jerusalem.

Liesen (edd.), Deuterocanonical and Cognate Literature Yearbook (Berlin ) –. According to Philo, the historical parts of the Pentateuch (in particular Genesis) constitute a kind of Jewish  ρ1αι λ γ α. From the literary point of view, this ancient history belongs to the genre of    ς and γενεαλ γικF *στ ρ α, including models of virtue and iniquity set in a retributive framework (Praem. –, Mos. .–). But from a deeper, synchronic point of view, this ancient history must be considered an integral part of the Mosaic law. The creation account serves as the beginning ( ρ1 ) of the law, indicating the consonance between the latter and the cosmic order (Opif. –).The patriarchs, then, are ‘living laws’, archetypes who by following nature have fullfilled the Mosaic legislation even before its formulation in writing (Abr. –). The point of intersection between the law of nature and the Mosaic precepts is formed by the virtues. Piety (εupsilonlenisσ  εια) and justice (δικαι σupsilonacuteνη) are at the basis of Abraham’s biography (Abr. –, –), and they parallel the two tables of the Decalogue, which in turn provide the taxonomy for the special laws.

The idea of this article is to determine the sense of the Logos in the Prologue of John’s Gospel by making use of the subsequent Christian doctrinal tradition. As an introduction, the general influence of Hellenistic Judaism on early Christian speculative theology and exegesis is illustrated by examples from Philo and Justin. Further, it is argued that Justin’s scriptural argument shows that the traditional derivation of the Logos of the Prologue from the word of creation of Gen  did not exist at that early stage, since if it did, that derivation ought to have appeared in Justin. Since no other derivation of a Logos in the cosmological sense from the Bible is possible, the presence of this idea in John can only be explained as the result of influence from the eclectic philosophy of Jewish Hellenism as witnessed by Philo.

Among the many adaptations they made, these exegetes often sought to transform the familiar stories to better fit or express their own constructs of gender identity. The study attempts to uncover the ideologies of masculinity in the depiction of Joseph in three first century Hellenistic Jewish texts: The Jewish Antiquities of Josephus, Philo’s Somn., and the anonymous Joseph and Aseneth.

Compared with other hymns in the New Testament which recognize three states of existence of Christ (John :–, Col :–, Heb : f.), Phil :–  is different because the text does not ascribe a cosmological role to the preexistent one, even though he is represented as a figure who thinks and makes decisions. In giving to him personal or human-like characteristics the author may be influenced by the figure of the Heavenly Man in Philo. Even if the hymn writer may not have been familiar with Philo’s writings, it is likely that he was aware of theological speculation similar to what is found there. It should be noted that Tobin presupposes his own analysis of Philo’s interpretation of the creation narrative which distinguishes different stages in which the Logos was only gradually assimilated to the Heavenly Man.

For this reason we give a more detailed summary than usual. Introduction (pp. –).Themonograph is devoted to probable cultural chan- nels throughwhich the unique collection of Philonic and pseudo-Philonicworks </page> <page sequence="383"> critical studies   has been transmitted to the Armenian milieu. Circumstantial characteristics of these channels can be found in the scholia (th–th centuries) to the Arme- nian corpus Philonicum, especially in the scholiasts’ view of Philo’s biography and in the categories which Armenian interpreters applied to the exegetical method used by the Alexandrian. The analysis of these concepts, while extend- ing beyond the Armenian context, presents an ideal opportunity for the recon- struction in general outline of an intellectual atmosphere which enabled Philo’s works to be adopted by early Christian tradition and later transferred to Arme- nian soil. Chapter : ‘Armenian version of the legend about Philo: literary sources and historical implications’ (pp. –). The Armenian Church doctors’ notions concerning Philo’s biography were mostly formed on the basis of the well- known sources, such as Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History and Chronicle and the apocryphal Vita Ioannis, and in this regard are nothing more than secondary literary fictions. However, the most original details of the narratives about Philo, namely the line connecting him with Jacob the Just and messianic movements in Palestine about the time of the Jewish War may conceal the remnants of the most ancient variant of the legend, which presented Philo as a Christian author. Nevertheless, judging from medieval Armenian practice, the body of Philo’s works has been included in school curricula not because of the legend, but rather the latter served as a justification of its inclusion. Chapter : ‘Philo’s exegetical method in interpretation by Armenian herme- neutists: formulating the problem’ (pp. –). The Armenian scholiasts per- ceived the Armenian corpus Philonicum not as a set of casual translations, but as a well-structured whole, connected together by the ideas of virtue and spiri- tual perfection. The complementary use of both these characteristics, as well as the general conviction of the Armenian monastic doctors about the spirituality of Philo’s exegesis, seems to be at variance with utterances concerning Philo’s method by Photius and especially by Ambrose. The latter made use of Philo’s ‘merely moral’, as he claims, interpretation for constructing his own spiritual exegesis of Gen :. The evidence for the particularity of the exegetical posi- tion of Armenian medieval teachers can be seen also in their tendency to iden- tify Philo’s allegorical method with exegetical methods used by the apostle Paul and described in his term  λληγ ρ upsilonacuteμενα (Gal :). Chapter : ‘Terms of contemplative exegesis in their application to Philo’s method’ (pp. –). There is a set of kindred terms, by means of which Arme- nian commentators tried to define the exegetical method of the Alexandrian: ‘intelligible’, ‘intellectual contemplation’, ‘new vision (or contemplation)’, ‘incor- poreal’, ‘subtle contemplation’. In investigating the provenance of this terminol- ogy it emerges that it was used by Greek and Latin authors to characterize the ‘spiritual’ and ‘anagogic’ interpretations of the Bible. Chapter : ‘Philo as a ‘spiritual’ author in the Armenian commentators’ view: on the source of tradition’ (pp. –). One can trace the essential concepts of spiritual exegesis in the Book of Wisdom, and especially in the encomium of sophia in :–. From the same tradition, probably, the notion on Philo as a spiritual author could arise, precisely because by conveying the philosophical sense of the Law, the Alexandrian gave the reader of the Holy Scripture the </page> <page sequence="384">  part two opportunity to contemplate the Divine Wisdom directly in its activity. While reinterpreting the spiritual exegetical method, the early Christian authors began to attribute to the Bible a merely dogmatic meaning. The habit of ascribing explicit or concealed dogmatic views to Philo probably should be connectedwith this very metamorphosis. It seems that the gradually fading tradition of spiritual exegesis resulted in a loss of interest toward Philo’s heritage as well. However, in the same epoch some works by Philo were translated into Armenian, and the Armenian scholiography of subsequent centuries diligently preserved the early Christian and possibly pre-Christian notions concerning Philo’s exegesis as well. Afterword (pp. –). In order to form at least a rough idea of the source from which the described notions might have been borrowed, one should note the considerable number of famous catechists who demonstrate knowledge of Philo’s works, especially of those included in the Armenian corpus. If the adoption of the Philonic heritage by Armenian scholars has happened due to the institution of catechization, the nearest point of transmission might be the Jerusalem Church, with which the Armenian Church always had very active relations. As the comparison of one of Cyril of Jerusalem’s catechetical homilies with the respective passage of Eusebius’ Preparatio Evangelica suggests, the collection might have been formed as a manual for the purpose of training future catechists, the spiritual preceptors of the church, or have been transmitted through some other, especially monastic, modifications of the catechetic rite.

Publication of the text of the introductory summary by vardapet Yakob (probably the future katholikos Yakob Klayec‘ I, †) dedicated to the Armenian Lectionary. The summary presents, mostly in a legendary way, the history of the Lectionary and discusses some controversial points concerning the calculation of some dates of the ecclesiastical year. From the Philonist point of view the most noteworthy aspect is the narration about the Christian community of Jerusalem, which was led by Jacob the Brother of the Lord, who, in the scholiast’s view, compiled the skeleton of the Jerusalem Lectionary. Before the siege of Jerusalem the community had migrated to Egypt (especially to the Thebaid), where Philo became acquainted with them and gave the evidence about them in his treatise Contempl.

Publication of the Armenian translation of Gregory of Nyssa’s Preface to his Commentary on the Song of Songs, with Greek parallels to the passages, whichmay be interpreted as containing ideological shifts that aim to present Gregory’s exegetical method not as Alexandrian, but as moderate Antiochean. The text is important as a probable source of the terminology used by Armenian scholiasts in their description of Philo’s exegesis. Summary in Armenian (pp. –).

The critical edition of the text of the epitome of the Prov., made in the school of the famous medieval Armenian vardapet Yovhanne ̄s Orotnec‘i (–), was prepared on the basis of three manuscripts, which are all preserved in Yere- van. In the Introduction to the edition the problem of authorship of the epitome is first discussed. Judging from the title, there are two possible inferences: (a) Yovhanne ̄s Orotnec‘i could have composed it by using some scholia of previ- ous authors; (b) the explanations given by the above-mentioned vardapet were recorded during class-readings and transformed in a rhetorical composition by one of his disciples. In the latter case the most probable candidate is Grigor Tathevatc‘i (†), who was known as a recorder of some other lectures deliv- ered by Orotnec‘i and who was familiar with several specific phrases of the epit- ome. Although it is a concise paraphrase of the Prov., the epitome differs from its source text in its general tendency and the proportions of its exposition. Con- trary to Philo, who claims to discuss the theses stated by Alexander only in the most friendly manner, the author of the epitome is intent to make a refutation against all those who do not believe inDivine Providence. Such a shift in percep- tion is very ancient; it can be noted already in citations from Prov. in Eusebius’ PE (see esp. τGς τ=ν    ων  ντι  σεις in ..). There are some large gaps in the exposition, but they should not be interpreted as lacunae: the omissions can be explained as a desire to counterbalance the scope of the first and second books of Prov. and to avoid items unknown to the Armenian audience. In the ‘Notes’ the additional sources of several passages of the epitome are pointed out: these areArmenian translations of Ps.Aristotle’sDeMundo and Plato’sTimaeus).

To understand the development of an authoritative, canonical body of texts, one must also consider how works that once held canonical status later lost this status. Veltri considers three examples: the canonization of the Septuagint in Jewish-Hellenistic and Christian tradition and its decanonization in rabbinic literature; patristic and rabbinic use of Aquila’s Greek translation of the Bible and Babylonian rabbinic replacement of Aquila’s translation byTargumOnkelos; and the Book of Ben Sira from the perspective of its Greek prologue and of rabbinic literature. Contrary to accepted opinion, the rise and fall of books among rabbinic Jews and Christians does not have to do with their opponents’ use of these books, but rather with inner dynamics within each community such as change in the primary language used by the community and the disappearance </page> <page sequence="386">  part two of the Alexandrian Jewish community. Among other sources, Philo is used to illuminate the process of canonization of the Greek Bible in Alexandria. (EB) 20697. U. Volp,DieWürde des Menschen. Ein Beitrag zur Anthropolo- gie in der Alten Kirche, Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae  (Leiden ), esp. –. In this habilitation thesis of the Friedrich-Wilhelm University Bonn brief remarks are made on Philo’s anthropology as part of the Jewish-Christian tradi- tion until the nd century c.e. Philo particularly values the doctrine of the ε8κDν  ε upsilontilde. The human being in the likeness of God is on the borderline (με  ρι ς) of the eternal and non-eternal nature, partaking in both in equal measure: the human body in the non-eternal, the human rationality in the divine nature (see Opif. ). Philo’s line of argument ends in his ethical call to be aware of oneself as an image of God.These Philonic themes can be observed in the anthropology of the early church fathers. (GS) 20698. A. Wasserstein and D. J. Wasserstein, The Legend of the Septuagint From Classical Antiquity to Today (Cambridge ), esp. – . This book traces how the legend about the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek evolved over two millennia and how Jews, Christians, Muslims, and pagans adapted this legend for their own purposes, most often to buttress the authority of the Greek text on which they relied. The section on Philo presents his account inMos. .– and carefully compares it with the Letter of Aristeas. Aspects of Philo’s account that differ from the Letter include Philo’s combina- tion of the figures of high priest and king into one, emphasis on divine involve- ment, description of details related to the island, account of an annual celebra- tion, omission of particulars related to the translation and the Library, added emphasis on the interest of the king, and, especially, ‘the recognition that trans- lation of Scripture needs a special vocabulary and that that special vocabulary is useful and valuable in direct proportion to its uniformity’ (p. ).

Scholars have debated whether Melchizedek in Q is an angel or Yhwh himself. A way of understanding this ambiguity is provided by the rabbinic doctrine of ‘two powers in Heaven,’ a concept similar to Philo’s portrayal of the divine Logos and to beliefs ascribed to the ‘Magharians,’ a later name given to a first-century Jewish sect. The varied images for Melchizedek in Q as both Yhwhhimself and his intermediary are also drawn fromvarious biblical passages and can thus be seen as ‘a natural development of their seminal overlapping in biblical tradition’ (p. ).

The semantic contours of the concept of the ‘richness of God’ as it occurs in about ten Philonic texts can be summarized as follows: () God is immeasurable and the quality of his richness marks his being God in clear differentiation from human beings and their richness. () God is not rich only for himself but also in order to do good things for others, because his richness has the intrinsic property to be transmitted to another in a universal sense. In this transmission God acts in caring for and preserving his whole creation. () Because God is God his richness is immeasurable and in this way his action towards his creation in the described manner is the reason for his being God. Many texts underline this Philonic background, which in turn illustrates the NewTestament discourse on the ‘richness of God’ as a tradition shared between Hellenistic Judaism and Christianity.

Wooden (edd.), Septuagint Research: Issues and Challenges in the Study of the Greek Jewish Scriptures, Society of Biblical Literature Septuagint and Cognate Studies  (Atlanta ) –. Based on ideas propounded byG. Toury, A. Pietersma has posited an interlin- ear model of the Septuagint according to which the Greek translation is under- stood as originally meant to have been used together with the Hebrew. In two accounts of the origins of the LXX—the Letter of Aristeas and Philo—however, the LXX stands independent of the original Hebrew. These accounts thus go beyond the interlinear model and reflect circumstances contemporary to the later authors. The Letter of Aristeas likely served as ‘a foundational myth of origins for the Septuagint’s transformed position/function as an independent, scriptural authority’ (p. ). Taking this position of the LXX as a given, Philo argues for the precision of theGreek translation in relation to theHebrew, proba- bly to underscore its divine origins and to justify Philo’s own exegetical approach which relied so closely upon the translation’s exact wording.
