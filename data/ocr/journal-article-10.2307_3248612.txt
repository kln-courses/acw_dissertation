EDWARD KIDDER, JR.: A JOMON VESSEL IN THE BUFFALO MUSEUM OF SCIENCE THE BUFFALO MUSEUM OF SCIENCE HAS RECENTLY ACQUIRED A VERY FINE Jomon pottery vessel whose provenance is Kobuchizara, Nagano Prefecture (pl. I ). This piece, lacking the customary cord-impression found on most of Jomon pottery, represents a plateau in the Katsusaka evolution, an evolution which takes place in the central mount- ainous districts of Japan and climaxes the Middle Jomon. 1 The Katsusaka style is particularly strong in the Tosan section where it appears virtually without cord-impression to form the last stage of opposition to this method of decoration destined to encompass all of Japan in later Jomon times. Central, western and southern Japan remained exclusionary to the cord-impression technique until after the middle of the Jomon period, but by Horinouchi times cord-marking was a wide-spread decorative for- mula embracing not only northern Japan, but also the islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, and the western and that part of Honshu south of Lake Biwa. Impressions of honey-comb, checker or zigzag patterns made with a carved stick served to ornament pottery surfaces in early Jomon times in southern regions. Important lingerings of this style in the extreme south complicate correlation attempts between Kyushu and Honshu. Pottery characteristics of Katsusaka show, in many instances, greater articulation of Moroiso innovations. The flaring top, probably taken from basketry forms, was inherited from Moroiso in the Tosan; rim projections also appear in Moroiso as does the embryonic use of plastic decoration. Rope-like ribbons of clay on Katsusaka vessels appear more frequently in the Kwanto Plain than elsewhere, and may also be a variant of the twisted strips of clay which characterize Moroiso B. This vessel, whose maximum width approximates its height, has a flaring, slightly inturned, undecorated mouth. The thickness at the mouth is slightly greater than through the walls, 1 The following information has been kindly provided by Miss Virginia Cummings of the staff of the Buf- falo Museum of Science: Ht. 17 3181; dm. at mouth i6"; average thickness of sherds I3132"; accession num- ber 5164; catalog number C 17079.

Body ornamentation consists of ribbons of clay running parallel to each other around the neck; snake-like strips hang from the lower one. Double undulating ribbons, vertically arranged, enliven the relief patterns at irregular intervals and contrast with the smooth perpendicular lines formed by the split end of a bamboo stick. At the neck these lines run diagonally and form ridges in strong relief. Short strips of clay disposed in an opposing oblique direction focus the decorative emphasis on the neck. Sand is the tempering material and the vessel is mainly a warm buff color with some darkened areas. Combining the two techniques of applied clay ribbons and bamboo stick incision work is a common method of embellishing Katsusaka vessels in the Tosan and in the northern Tokai. However, the undecorated collar is more prevalent in the Kwanto Plain and to the north in Ibaragi Prefecture. In the former district it is strongly curved and often supplied with one or more loop projections. Vessels of similar shape and technique to the Buffalo vessel, but with decorated "cup" are known from the Tosan,2 while an almost identical vessel, except for more lavish use of clay strips, was found in the prefecture of Ibaragi.8 Katsusaka, unlike most Middle and Late Jomon styles, is limited in scope. Its distribution is confined mainly to the central and northern parts of the Hokuroku, Tosan and Tokai, in a large triangle bounded by the prefectures of Niigata in the northwest, Toyama in the southwest and Chiba in the east. A contemporary phase, Otamadai, with coastal sites east of Tokyo, is closely allied to Katsusaka in the general appearance of the vessels, but is less influential on succeeding phases. The Ubayama (or Kasori E) types stem directly from the refined eastern manifestations of Katsusaka; they suggest a reaction to the Katsusaka broken silhouettes, heavy plastic decor, and grotesque opulence of ornamentation particularly evident in western products.' Provincial types south of Central Honshu evince little influence from Katsusaka sources 2 S. Sugiyama, Nihon genshi kogei gaisetsu, Tokyo, 1928, pi. 30, no. 4; K.

XXXI b. 1 2</page><page sequence="4">except possibly, in some instances, in collar formations. In north Honshu the develop- ment is a separate one, but a relationship may be established with the large, cord-impressed, generally cylindrical vessels sometimes known as late Tsukinoki, on which plastic decoration and rim knobs appear for the first time.. The rim merlons, however, seem to be of Moroiso descent. Shapes are limited in range, in contrast with the great variety found in central Honshu. Some vessels, or perhaps a select few, had a ritual use as evidenced by their arrangement at certain sites. At Hirahata in Niigata Prefecture, for instance, a Katsusaka vessel was found with flat stones placed on three sides.5 It may then be inferred that some if not all the decoration on such vessels has a symbolic significance. In a geographical belt across central Japan the undulating rims are most massive and montiform in this and the Otamadai groups and imply substantive conceptions of sacred mountain worship communicated from southern sources, possibly south China coastal areas from where sacred tree worship may also have been transmitted to ancient Japan. Such a bold and assertive character in pottery and its decorative forms may stem from the rude, primitive, and spirited temperament of the inhabitants of the mountains, for even today in Ainu mythology there is a tendency to identify warlike and courageous people with mountain dwellers. Innovations of the Katsusaka period include much greater use of shell ornaments, the round pit-dwelling, the polished rectangular axe, consistent appearance of anthropomorphic clay figurines, stone clubs identified with phallic symbolism and strongly plastic decoration on pottery vessels. The northern character in this retarded neolithic is seen in the female figurines, evidence of a legacy from the paleolithic to which the early settlers of Japan had strong ties. Clay figurines seem to have made their initial appearance among the hill dwellers of central Honshu. Evidence is meager to suggest that the Tosan was extensively inhabited before Moroiso times, but in the Katsusaka period the dominant character of these people asserts itself over the plain dwellers, although it is probable that the latter were their instructors in 5 Ibid., p. 50o. 6 Ibid., pl.

A paramount peculiarity of the Katsusaka period is that its generating force exists in a mountainous region and is reflected on the plains, in marked contrast with the less striking, but wider spread major styles which develop on the plains, if not the Kwanto or Kinai, then the Kitakami or Aomori plains. Undoubtedly the continuity in styles is more apparent on the plains, and often greater perception of contacts is possible between plains rather than between plain and mountainous hinterland. It is not till after Katsusaka times that the majority of figurines have a wholly human visage; those heads of Katsusaka springing from the rims of vessels may have a totemic significance as protectors, and three animal species, the rodent, feline and canine, may identified.7 The rodent type is more common in the region from which the Buffalo Museum vessel has come, whereas the canine and feline types have for their provenance more often the Yamanashi prefectural area, slightly to the east of the former. It would seem, that although female figurines appear about the same time as the heads on vessel rims and figurines of a zoomor- phic nature, the distinctively female clay statuette is not a common household divinity until the Horinouchi period. Fewer than one thousand whole or fragmentary figures have been found and a majority have come from domestic sites. Others not unearthed in such sites were doubtlessly disposed of because of breakage, obsolescence of character, or the result of social or political disturbances that forced the inhabitants to abandon their belongings. Some statuettes have small perforations for suspension purposes and are rather worn as if they were constantly handled or rubbed against clothes (though this is more the case with the plaques of later neolithic times), but many are legless and stand upright. In some instances stone circles surrounded the figuriness who were, presumably, material represent- ations of the goddess of Ainu legends, an all-embracing maternal deity, dedicated to the nourishing of the infant, shielding the cradle, guiding the growth of the adolescent, and interceding for him before the Creator in his years of maturity. As the physical symbol sprang into reality through its transformation in the remedial powers of the fire, so the invocation of the Fire Goddess was intended to heal the diseased, give vitality and warmth, 14</page><page sequence="6">and maintain the continuity of life. These figurines may have been put to two highly selective uses. The Fire Goddess, worshipped today by the Ainu as a spirit in the fire, but no longer made in effigy, is the benefactor of the newly-married and healer of the sick. It is apparent that all families did not have such statuettes; perhaps it was a requisite in newly founded homes or in those where extended illness existed. Male principle worshippers lived side by side with figurine idolizers. Stone clubs (seki-bo) make a belated appearance in the Middle Jomon; they are polished and not entirely lacking in sophistication. Many of those of Middle Jomon are large (three feet or more), elliptical in cross-section and double-headed, or circular in section with one knob and slightly pointed on the other end. Later seki-bo may carry ornate carving on the heads, commonly of a geometric nature, and are almost always single-headed, but in some instances they have no knobs at all; they are merely pointed at both ends. These are ellipt- ical in section. Seki-bo are more prevalent in north Japan than elsewhere, but in early use have more of a southern character being associated with the agricultural cycles in southern Asiatic regions. In the Late Jomon they become confused with the long sword,9 only they have a slight curvature in contrast with the metal sword known in Japan at that time, the Han dynasty straight sword, and with which these late seki-bo are either contemporary or slightly later. Larger ones were placed along road beds where visibility was a prime need and space not a factor. As field markers they identified the seasonal with the human cycles and acted as protectors of the lines of comunication and of those who travelled them. Considering that the larger ones are in general earlier, its inception may have taken place as an out-of-doors cult and have been associated with the worship of sacred mountains and trees, presently taking on a more personal character to become the family shrine and acquiring some of the aspects of ancestor worship. In a pit-dwelling at Iwao in Shizuoka Prefecture one seki-bo was found standing upright and ringed by round stones.1? It is probably significant that one translation of the Ainu word sometimes used for their chief deity, Tuntu, is "pillar" or its equivalent.ll 9 Nakaya, op. cit., pl.

Its profusion in Japan is only surpassed in the Malay peninsula, Sumatra and Java. Although the bi-faceted character of the Katsusaka period is apparent, southern characteristics tend to dominate it. The lack of cord-impression before the latter part of Middle Jomon is indicative of southern Japanese connections. Stimulation toward extensive use of shell ornaments probably came through the Ryukyu Islands in this case where sites believed to be Middle Jomon in time are rich in shell adornments. The new axe type is a frequent southern type, and the earliest phase of seki-bo worship seems to be of a southern character. Distinctively northern in aspect, however, are the figurines and pit-dwellings. I6</page></plain_text>
