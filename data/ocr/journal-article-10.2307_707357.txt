<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECOMING LIKE GOD DIETRICH ROLOFF: GottAhnlichkeit, Verg6ttlichung und Erhdhung zu seligen Leben. Untersuchungen zur Herkunft der platonischen Angleichung an Gott. (Untersuchungen zur antiken Literatur und Geschichte, 4-) Pp. vi+243. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1970. Cloth, DM. 64. IN his foreword to this extremely valuable and important book its author describes its aim as being to ascertain what pre-Platonic anticipations can be discovered of Theaetetus 176 b's exhortation to seek kolwans 0T O KaG7d To Svva7o'v and exactly where Plato's own originality lies. In fact most of it is concerned with the former of these topics, whereas the latter is very briefly dealt with in a concluding chapter of a mere nine pages. This is inevitable, since it is hard to see how any definite conclusions regarding Plato's originality can be drawn without a better knowledge of early Orphism and Pythagoreanism than we possess. Here Roloff is surely wise in confining himself to definitely pre-Platonic texts (principally Empedocles' Katharmoi, along with Pindar's Second Olympian and some of his fragments) and declining to venture on to the shaky sands of conjecture (cf. his p. I92). He does not, however, face the question whether, this being so, his (apparently correct) conclusion that no extant pre-Platonic text exactly anticipates the Theaetetus' formula has much significance and whether Arius Didymus' ascription of the tpFoLwts Oe5 for- mula to Pythagoras may not have rested on early evidence now lost. This does not, however, detract seriously from his work's importance, since its main value lies not here, but in its exhaustive examination of all the extant material from fifth-century or earlier Greek authors relevant to the above topics, or more exactly to their views on the possibilities open to man of attaining likeness to God, divinization, or transition, in this or a future life, to a blessed state, such as the Elysian Fields or the Homeric pLaKpOpwv vc-aoL. The bulk of the work falls into three parts, the first (comprising nearly half of the total) dealing with the Homeric hero's relation to the gods, with the possibilities open to him of attaining a superhuman state, and with the founda- tions, significance, and limitations of these possibilities. The second part, concerned with post-Homeric authors' transposition of these ideas from the hero to the ordinary man, falls into two sections, the first of which deals with their application to man of conceptions already found in Homer, the latter with their development of new ideas not so found, in particular of ideas de- pendent on a subtler, less anthropomorphic view of the divine than the Homeric one and on the evolution of Greek ideas on the relations between man E</page><page sequence="2">50 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW and God. It thus emerges how many of the older ideas lost their meaning and were replaced by new ones, such as divinization through power or achieve- ment; the second section also deals with the implications of Parmenides' vision of Truth. Other philosophers, Heraclitus and Empedocles, are dealt with in the third, and shortest, of the book's main parts, along with the Eleusinian Mysteries and the 'Orphic' passages in Pindar, sources whose common feature is the view of divinization or beatitude as largely dependent on man's own initiative, whereas in the authors previously discussed divine grace had been, if not the only relevant factor, at least the overwhelmingly decisive one. In the final part, already referred to, the author summarizes his conclusions and discusses their implications for the question of Plato's originality. A particularly useful and commendable feature of Roloff's book is his very clear and orderly arrangement of his material. The main sources to be con- sidered are listed in a short introduction, while two indexes are provided of the passages discussed, one arranged according to authors, the other according to subject-matter. Reference to particular author or topic is also greatly facilitated by the division of the text into logical and clearly headed subdivisions. Throughout the book the contribution of the several passages to the author's main theme is dealt with in the main text, while subordinate points concerning the texts themselves or their detailed interpretation are treated in numerous footnotes (cf., for instance, the interpretation of Pindar's Sixth Nemean in the long note on pp. 163-6). It is thus made as easy as possible for those who dis- agree with Roloff's view on a particular point to form their own conclusions. His book is likely to remain an indispensable work of reference for students of Greek literature, religion, and thought for many years to come. University of Oklahoma R. T. WALLIS</page></plain_text>
