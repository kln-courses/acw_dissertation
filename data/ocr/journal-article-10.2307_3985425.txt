<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Our Animal Friends" Depictions of Animals in Readers Digest During the 1950s David Peterson del Mar Environmental historians generally agree that western civilization has become more favorably disposed toward animals during the modern era. Roderick Nash, Lisa Mighetto, and Thomas Dunlap argue that people in the United States grew more sympathetic toward other creatures during the nineteenth and particularly the twentieth centuries, a shift that Nash links to changing perceptions of the wilderness and to a willingness to extend the liberal tradition to nonhumans. Keith Thomas locates this shift much earlier for England, asserting that by the eighteenth century its residents studied animals for their own sake, lavished at- tention on pets, and protested cruelty to at least some creatures. By 18oo, Tho- mas notes, the "claim that animals were made only for man's use was still being advanced, but it no longer carried general assent." "Very soon," he concludes, "it would disappear almost altogether." Leading historians of western attitudes to- ward nature describe a modern shift toward accepting and championing the wild, the animal.' Modern constructions or understandings of animals cannot be viewed simply as sympathetic or respectful, as stories about animals that appeared during the 1950S in Reader's Digest, easily the most ubiquitous North American magazine of that time, clearly demonstrate. These stories indicate that mainstream U.S. culture did indeed depict most wild animals in highly positive terms. But these depictions very much served human ends, and writers and readers made very little effort to approach animals on animals' terms. These creatures deserved regard not as sentient beings with their own agendas and rights. Rather, they elicited affectionate interest from humans largely on the basis of their purported interest in humans. Domesticated and wild animals alike became people's ser- vile friends in the pages of Reader's Digest By the 1950s, the United States had recovered from the dislocations of the Depression and World War II. A long economic boom facilitated widespread prosperity and quickened the movement from farm and small town to city and especially suburb. Explicit struggles against the nonhuman world lay, for most</page><page sequence="2">26 Environmental History people, in the past, and radical environmentalism would not appear until well into the next decade. Reader's Digest flourished in this sort of economic and social milieu. Founded by DeWitt and Lila Bell Wallace in the early 1920S, and based, appropriately, in a small town named Pleasantville in New York State, it enjoyed close to fifteen million worldwide subscribers by 1950. In 1951, Time pronounced that DeWitt Wallace was "the most successful editor in history" as judged by "world circulation standards." This is not to say that the Digest was a critical success. One contributor observed that the magazine appealed to "intel- lectual mediocrity" and required "no thought or perception." The Nation re- ferred to it as "packaged sweetness and synthetic light" in 1950.2 Leading historians of environmental thought do not typically use this type of source. Keith Thomas, Roderick Nash, Carolyn Merchant, Donald Worster, and Samuel Hays relied heavily on prominent intellectuals and politicians, revealing a great deal about the leading edge of western environmental perceptions, but much less about how the great majority of people felt about animals, plants, and other aspects of the nonhuman landscape. Reader's Digest is an ideal source for plumbing those beliefs. To be sure, the Digest was a single publication with a single, powerful editor, but the magazine's articles reflected far more than DeWitt Wallace's outlook. By the 1950s, it gleaned most of its material from other peri- odicals and increasingly from popular books. Furthermore, DeWitt Wallace pos- sessed, as one observer put it, "an extraordinary common touch-a feeling for what the reading public wanted and how they wanted it."3 Reader's Digest aimed at and resonated with a truly mass audience and may well have more fully shaped and reflected mainstream American culture than any other magazine for several decades. An assessment of its content in the 1950S can disclose highly popular, widely shared attitudes toward animals at a time after most Americans ceased to use animals directly in an instrumental fashion, but before debates over radical environmentalism fragmented and polarized those attitudes. To some extent, animals in the pages of Reader's Digest remained in a myste- rious and fascinating world unto itself. Alan Devoe, a frequent contributor, wrote articles with often awestruck titles: "What Snakes Are Really Like," "The Marvel of an Insect," and "The Miracle of Birds." As these titles suggest, Devoe largely concerned himself with describing the incredible ways in which relatively ob- scure and often maligned animals functioned. "To understand a snake's life," he remarked, "is to encounter some of the most amazing adaptations and special- ized gifts in the world of nature."4 Devoe and other descriptive naturalists spelled out birds' capacity for flight, insects' keen sense of taste and smell, spiders' mani- fold skills of travel and web-weaving, and bees' ability to pollinate. "Nature," Devoe concluded, "is constantly producing, with the ease of indefinite creative- ness and prodigality, the most astonishing and improbable things."5 Digest writers occasionally made explicit the gulf between human and ani- mal. A writer who addressed the "Wonderland of Ants" described a world in which females "make all the decisions" and tireless workers fed and died for their queen. Ant society "fulfills every law of the blind tyrant instinct" untouched by "the light of reason by which we humans make our mistakes and find our free-</page><page sequence="3">Animals in Reader's Digest 27 dom." But not all contributors found instinct and nature wholly inferior to civi- lization. Caroline Bird promoted bird watching as "an escape into reality," for birds lived "in a natural order to which we can never return." Laurie York Erskine penned a largely sympathetic article on wolves in which she touted both their "control of the wildlife population" and their pride and defiance, their refusal "to wear man's collar." In a particularly telling story, Loren Eiseley related how a captured hawk he had released shot up into the air to join its mate, meeting her "in a great soaring gyre." Then the two "were gone forever somewhere into those upper regions beyond the eyes of men."6 Beyond the eyes of men. In a machine-dominated age, Reader's Digest occa- sionally evoked a nature beyond human understanding and control, a world unbounded by regimentation or limit, a world very unlike modern society. Even when writers found themselves fascinated by nature's otherness, the source of their interest commonly sprang less from a desire to understand other creatures than from a desire to construct a foil for human society, regardless of whether one regarded modern western civilization as a marvellous achievement or as dangerously domesticated. This connection of wild with uncivilized and unfettered was a minor theme compared to the quintessential Reader's Digest animal: the dog, abject and dis- consolate away from its master's feet. Dogs made themselves very much at home on the pages of the magazine in the 1950s, providing the focal point for thirty-one articles, or about one in every four issues. No other animal, wild or domestic, approached their popularity. The magazine published just thirty-three pieces on all types of birds, including three on hawks, and twenty-three on all types of insects, including three on bees. Horses had eleven articles, cats just four. The Digest even set aside a column for readers' dog stories: "Man's Best Friend." Dogs received the magazine's ultimate accolade in 1959 when a contributor noted that Chinese communists disapproved of them."7 Dogs, by definition, loved people. One article described that crucial supper some eighty centuries past when "a wolflike animal, with "a jaunty wagging tail and two soulful eyes" announced to a Neolithic family that "he wanted in." Willing subservience accompanied inclusion. "Fundamentally all dogs want to please people," asserted one writer. Even sustained cruelty could not obliterate dogs' eagerness to serve. A reader recounted how in the Himalayas he had come to own a huge, vicious mastiff who had "been badly manhandled." When this dog finally gained its freedom, it first shot away, but then dashed back to its owner. The man stood still, immobilized by fear. The dog slid to a stop, and "in a tumultuous release of long pent-up emotions, he lifted his head, with shining eyes-for me to pet him." This loyal servant died defending the local people against a leopard. Another reader told of how her black Shepherd, deeply wounded by its displacement in the family's affections by a human child, gently carried that baby to safety when their home caught fire."8 This determination to obey and please at any cost prompted incredible acts of devotion. One contributor recalled fondly how Rover, the family dog, cared for him as a young child. Rover eventually became old and listless, and at last the</page><page sequence="4">28 Environmental History boy's parents took their veterinarian's advice and decided to end the faithful pet's life. They drove to a familiar hunting place, and the father and the dog walked into the woods. The boy heard a shot, and soon afterward Rover returned to the car, bleeding from a gunshot wound near one of his hips. When mother and boy attempted to get out of the car, Rover growled "as if we were his worst enemies." Neither would he allow the father to get in the vehicle. Then the father noticed something under the automobile that Rover had spotted long before: a rattle- snake that might have bitten a family member. He shot the snake, and the family took Rover to the veterinarian to be bandaged. Rover died a year later, at home while asleep. Another Digest contributor, a naval officer, recalled how a large terrier purposefully inspected several ships in Vancouver harbor before choosing to board his. Yet the dog spurned crew members' entreaties of friendship, allow- ing "his head to be patted," but exhibiting "no return of affection." Over two weeks later, the ship came in sight of a Dutch vessel off the coast of Japan, and the dog became wildly excited. The dog's master, on board that ship, recognized his pet's bark, and the two were reunited.9 Man and dog-much more often than woman and dog-often formed the most intimate friendships in the pages of Reader's Digest. Another former naval officer, Paul Schubert, recounted in loving detail how he became fast friends with Jim, canine mascot of the USS Texas. Jim "loved to go ashore and run and smell the smells and chase the ladies and have a hell of a time the way sailors do." But this friendship transcended mere camaraderie. Decades after Jim's death, Schubert asserted that "his personality stands out as vividly as that of any human I have ever met." "You didn't have to speak to him to make yourself understood," he explained, and "if you were miserable or sick, he was compassion itself.... If you gave him love, he gave back adoration."lo Canadian writer Farley Mowat offered a particularly vivid portrait of the profound partnership between dog and man in The Dog Who Wouldn't Be, a book that Reader's Digest condensed in 1958. Mowat's entertaining descriptions of Mutt's personality and accomplish- ments ended with the morning that he discovered his companion's death. He followed Mutt's tracks to a pond: "I was not alone, for Mutt's tracks went with me, each pawprint as familiar as the print of my own hand. I followed them, and I knew each thing he had done, each move he had made, each thought that had been his. For so it is with two who live one life together." A reckless truck driver cut down Mutt soon after he had made those tracks, ending, Mowat later real- ized, "the best years that I had lived.""1 Close relationships between dog and man formed under unpromising circum- stances. Even aspiring revisionists ended up confessing their attachment to trouble- some dogs. Robert de Roos, after detailing how his boxer had cost the family $2,300 through assorted mishaps, admitted that "I have a sneaking admiration for him." Roger Angell declared that "a dog's capacity to inflate the ego of his owner is almost nil. His capacity to inconvenience, embarrass and belittle him is almost unbounded." But he concluded that "taking on a dog is like taking on a wife and family," for although "it deprives you of a good portion of your freedom, mobility, pride and independence ... most of the time you know that you just</page><page sequence="5">Animals in Reader's Digest 29 couldn't get along without such a pleasantly cluttered life." Robert Dovers, in the aptly entitled My Friends the Huskies, published in condensed form by Reader's Digest in 1958, illustrated how men could form intimate relationships with even the least domesticated dogs. Dovers described how sled dogs in the Antarctic would kill penguins by the score if given the opportunity, ate their own young, and ruthlessly set upon each other without provocation. While not par- ticularly successful in controlling these animals, Dovers eventually became de- voted to them. When he took leave from his companions-"men and dogs"-he remarked that one "left a gap in my life no other dog will ever fill," that "it was like saying farewell for the last time to an old and dear friend." Deeply ingrained links between dog and man became manifest even under the most trying condi- tions.12 Cats finished a very distant second to dogs as companions, but here too, people and pets formed intimate friendships. "How come Kitty acts not like the beast of prey she is but like a better-class human being?" wondered one contributor. In 1953, Reader's Digest excerpted a brief selection from Charles Dudley Warner's My Summer In a Garden, first published in 1870, that detailed his friendship with Calvin. Calvin "could do almost anything but speak," remarked Warner, "and sometimes you could see a pathetic longing to do that in his face." Warner's observation that Calvin's "fondness for nature was most noticeable" underscored his pet's status as a nonanimal. Though more shy than a dog in his affections, Calvin loved Warner deeply: "Often he would sit looking at me, and then, moved by a delicate affection, come and pull at my coat and sleeve until he could touch my face with his nose, and then go away contented." Calvin increased his atten- tions when Warner's wife was away, "as if he had plainly said, 'I know that she has gone away, but I am here."' Cats, like dogs, exhibited a remarkable and constant sensitivity to their masters needs.13 That devoted pets formed intimate relationships with their masters in the pages of Reader's Digest is not surprising. Such roles expanded as the instrumental functions of dogs and cats shrank in the course of the twentieth century, and as growing numbers of people withdrew into their homes. But animals who nor- mally lived far apart from humans also acted as if they were man's best friend. Digest contributors frequently took pains to point out the manifold and subtle ways in which wild animals benefited humans. Beavers, for example, built dams that controlled floods, created rich soils, facilitated plant diversity, and attracted a broad range of fish and wildlife. Animals commonly rendered such service intentionally. One writer referred to storks as "this most human of birds" that "has long thrown in his lot with man, on whose roof he is protected," a protection that storks repaid by warding off lightning and ensuring prosperity. Even snakes looked out for people. Devoe related a story that he had often heard about a snake that spit poison in a milk crock to revenge herself on a cleaning woman who apparently intended to kill the snake's babies. But when residents of the castle instead carefully put the baby snakes outside, a "terrible remorse" worked its way into the mother snake's heart, and she turned over the crock to save those kind people from drinking the poison. Another contributor recalled how as a</page><page sequence="6">30 Environmental History child he went berry-picking in North Carolina with some friends and a baby and discovered the baby petting and talking to a huge rattlesnake that did not harm the trusting child. Mary Ellen Chase explained that as a young woman she over- came her phobia of snakes when she first touched one. That snake, she realized, was "trusting to me for friendly treatment," for its head "was more desperate than cunning or dangerous." From this event, Chase overcame much more than her fear of snakes; she learned that she and ordinary people like her had "reserves of bravery and of common sense" to draw from in any crisis. Years later, when her terrier brought home a snake, she gently removed it from his jaws and freed it, for "one of its family had long ago, I remembered, given me freedom from cap- tivity and terror." Fleeting, evidently chance encounters between animal and human became long-remembered exchanges in which compassionate animals bestowed cherished lessons.4 Chase's snakes slithered away when offered their freedom, but many wild ani- mals happily cast their lot with people. Devoe edited a column entitled "The Friendly Wild," in which readers shared examples of wild animals' determina- tion to win human friendship, and many articles echoed the same theme. Con- tributors described fawns that insisted on sharing their bed, musk oxen that romped in ponds with their children, mice that ran to the door to greet them, and seals that insisted on sitting on their laps. "The Moose Who Liked People" chronicled the life of Svea, who repeatedly chose human companionship over Denmark's wilderness. Another story followed the progress of Jane, a Canada goose adopted at birth by humans; she flew alongside her masters' pickup truck when she got too big to ride inside of it. "The White Lady" featured an even more unlikely protagonist, an albino bat who, on her first flight, brushed her wings against the face of the man who had cradled her as a newborn "like a child who cries, 'Look at me, look what I can do."'15 The question posed in the title of a Devoe article-"Are Animals Really 'Wild'?"-wvas clearly rhetorical. One of his stories described a fox that he encoun- tered in the woods that stared at him instead of fleeing. When he tossed a stick at the fox, it "ran toward me, in great bounding leaps, pounced upon the stick, and with the head-high prance of a happy collie went dancing off into the woods." The fox had "confided to me," concluded Devoe, that "he'd like to be a dog." Peter Farb, in an article condensed from Audubon Magazine, reported that hawks "can be trained to the affectionate obedience of a dog." Contributors wrote of a peccary who rubbed a man's leg "like a kitten," caribou who "trotted behind me like a dog," and an eagle who "followed Jim around our yard like a puppy." To be sure, such inti- macy most commonly occurred when humans raised wild animals from infancy, or when they intervened to protect or rescue an animal in distress. But the fact that these animals responded so eagerly to human care suggested a predisposition to- ward humans. As one zoo director said, &lt;I have never known any animal that wasn't ready to be a friend.'6 Wild animals in Reader's Digest displayed a doglike capacity to nurture the people they befriended. A contributor to "The Friendly Wild" described an ex- traordinary pair of sea lions: "Almost overpoweringly, they loved me." In "The</page><page sequence="7">Animals in Reader's Digest 31 Falcon and I," Jean George described how she and a falcon named Bad Boy "grew up together" in a shared childhood as intense in its way as the one that Mowat had with his dog. George met Bad Boy when the bird was only four weeks old, not coincidentally the same day that "my mother had finished telling me the facts of life." George's older brothers, experienced falconers, prompted her to train Bad Boy to obey. Bad Boy's first and very painful experience at trying to fly away while slender thongs bound him to his perch was followed a few hours later by George's first social-dancing lesson. That summer the bird "became a falcon-a hunter," while George "was trained in the female arts-cooking, sewing, housekeeping." Her training climaxed with her mother's observation that she was "developing nicely" and the presentation of "a girdle, silk stockings and a brassiere!" George "buried them resentfully at the bottom of the bureau drawer," but Bad Boy continued to ease her transition into womanhood. When company arrived, the pet caused such a stir that "I forgot my own awkward embarrassment in the midst of adults." One evening, when she realized that "Mother wanted me to look particularly nice," she "dug out those hidden garments" and put them on. "An exciting pride" overcame her, and before walking downstairs as an adult woman, she also overcame her revtulsion of Bad Boy's hood and slipped it over his head, "with some vague under- standing that the hood," like the brassiere, "wasn't so cruel after all." The next summer, George became increasingly preoccupied with socializing, and Bad Boy ranged increasingly far afield. One day, after Bad Boy had been absent for two weeks, she simultaneously spied a "romantically bouffant" yellow gown on her bed and Bad Boy in the tree outside her window, looking at her. George turned away to examine herself in the mirror, and when she looked back to the window, Bad Boy was ascending into the sky, flying "like a wild bird." "I sensed," remembered George, that "he would not be back." No longer needed, having trained George to make her peace with the confines of femininity, the falcon left her to adulthood.'7 Bad Boy's departure raised the question of whether wild animals truly belonged with their human friends. Premature death occasionally claimed animals who trusted humans too much. Mowat, infinitely more attuned to tragedy and pathos than most Digest contributors, described the sad ending of two owls who had befriended his family. When the family moved, it left the pets with a farmer who lived some distance away. One owl strangled himself in his cage. The other escaped and flew two hundred miles to the Mowats' old home in Saskatoon, where the new resident of the house shot him. Another contributor recalled that the wounded gander he had nursed back to health as a boy became "as sociable as a collie pup." The bird eventually took a domesticated goose as a mate, and when his wing healed, chose to stay with his partner and his human hosts rather than migrating. But a clumsy hunter, "a city dude," killed his mate. The bereaved gander put his bill into the hand of the boy, "whimpering like a grieving dog," and then joined a flock of his kin above, never to return.'8 Other writers strenuously asserted that animals were much better off with hu- mans than without them. One described the captivity of Bubbles, a pilot whale at the Los Angeles Oceanarium. After her capture, she had at first remained motionless, day after day, "apparently determined to starve herself into the re-</page><page sequence="8">32 Environmental History lease of death." But then all at once "Bubbles came alive again," exploring the "circumference and content of her new world ... to truly relate herself to it." She discovered her happy destiny one day when she exploded from the bottom of the tank to leap "15 feet in the air to pluck the squid neatly out of [her] astonished trainer's hand." The whale surely noted "the excitement and applause above her," and Bubbles from that point on became a "delightful and purposeful ham" who retrieved plastic life rings like a dog, leaped over rope hurdles, played base- ball, and waved at, danced for, and serenaded her audience. She found her call- ing in pleasing humans. Another contributor, writing of circus elephants, wondered if such "great, free creatures" should be "made the slaves of puny human beings." But "there is a kinship between elephants and men," an "obedience and loyalty to those they love" that "remains steadfast to the end." William M. Mann, director of the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., made the same point in clearer terms. According to Mann, zoos relieved the principal concerns of wild animals: safety, food, and territory. But human contact also counted, for animals "seem to know the value of ... the friendship of man," and he mentioned the companion- ship of a keeper in the same breath as the companionship of a mate.19 Given this rapprochement between humans and other animals, Reader's Digest had little to say in defense of hunting. When wild animals appeared as faithful dogs or even as persons, it was hard to shoot them. The man who had adopted Jane, the goose who liked to ride in and fly alongside his pickup, closed his account of her life by noting that he had "never shot at a Canada goose" since meeting her. A New York State homeowner faced a conundrum when a beaver dam caused flooding in his basement: "I couldn't shoot them" for "they were practically human." One article traced the life of Frank Carroll, a "self-taught naturalist" of the Louisiana marshlands, who grew up hunting until there "came one of those decisive moments that change an entire life." One afternoon, tramping through his beloved marshes, Carroll "suddenly realized that he no longer wished to shoot the small animals cowering in the reeds before him and the birds flying overhead," that "he was interested in these furred and flying creatures for their own sakes, as part of the great pattern of creation." Robin Collins, in an article condensed from Rod and Gun in Canada, related a similar epiphany in much more detail. Collins first set eyes on Graybeard, a majestic bushbuck, as a boy of ten in South Africa. "It was every hunter's desire to kill him," he recalled, "and from that day I could think of little else," for that achievement would mark "my initiation into manhood." Four years later, young Collins had his chance when the unsuspecting Graybeard stepped into a clearing only ten yards from the eager hunter. "Yet something made me hold my fire," remembered Collins. "There was pride and dignity in every line of his body, and I knew suddenly that I could not destroy him.... I could not buy the hunter's badge at the price of so much splendor."20 Other authors who hunted or fished portrayed the killing of another creature as almost incidental to those pastimes. In sharing his joy of fishing, Philip Wylie recalled his first success at age eight: "The fish as food did not enter my thoughts ... and I didn't think of killing the fish." "Genuine" fishermen used a different vocabulary-"their word is 'catch."' Mowat offered a similar account of</page><page sequence="9">Animals in Reader's Digest 33 goose hunting with his father. His narrative dwelled on "a spectacle of incompa- rable grandeur" as "seemingly endless flocks of geese drifted low and wraithlike overhead." The sound of their guns "seemed puny and was lost at once in that immensity of wind and water." "It was pure mischance. . . that one of the birds was hit," for neither father nor son "had really aimed at those magnificent gray presences." The story then turned to the remarkable efforts of Mutt, Mowat's companion/dog, to retrieve the wounded goose. He succeeded, though the reader is never informed of the goose's death.21 Even big game hunters, men who made their living by killing and helping others to kill, did not wish to see animals die. Robert Ruark described Harry Selby, a professional hunter in Kenya, as a man who "hates to use a gun worse than any other man I ever met," a man who preferred "to watch animals and learn more about them." Ruark himself, after a detailed and bloody narrative of his hunting exploits under Selby's tutelage, averred that the magnificent African landscape "was what I wanted to remember, more than what I'd shot." He later expanded on these themes in "The Most Unforgettable Character I've Ever Met," a regular Digest feature. Here he described how Selby risked overturning a jeep to avoid some baby birds, ran the vehicle into a rock to avoid a fox, and risked the lives of himself and his charges rather than shoot a lion with cubs. Selby's "job" was hunting, but "his pleasure" was "to look and to admire, not to kill." A third piece on African big game advocated hunting with a camera rather than a gun. Reader's Digest did not exa&amp;tly attack hunting, but it offered few explicit de- fenses of it.2 Despite this overall tone, the magazine identified several animals that needed to be killed, and killed ruthlessly. Insects topped the list. Contributors described the deprivations of bark beetles, "the hungry gangster" that in less than a decade had destroyed enough wood to build nearly half a million houses; grasshoppers with "flappy lips" that devoured crops, and even clothing; fire ants, "insatiable pests" that killed plants and even young calves and pigs; and "the vicious screw- worm fly" that infected farm animals. Larger creatures could be equally evil. An article on rats began by identifying them as "the deadliest, most destructive of all animal enemies of humanity." Vampire bats, "grim" and "sinister" creatures that walked like "a storybook goblin or a monstrous spider," deserved condemnation. So did the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish described as "an evil marine vampire," "an eel-like bloodsucker," a "monster," and as "ocean demons" that attached themselves to Great Lake trout and occasionally even to human beings. Con- tributors also censured animals that harmed ranchers. One piece, condensed from True, sang the praises of three Arizona brothers who destroyed innumer- able "mountain lions, bears and wolves." Nor did Reader's Digest express much sympathy for animals that directly attacked humans.23 In sum, bad animals, ani- mals that deserved to be or needed to be killed, were animals that harmed people. That harm could be direct, as when a jaguar attacked a man, or it could be indirect, as when a bark beetle attacked a tree that represented someone's finan- cial investment.</page><page sequence="10">34 Environmental History When Digestcontributors defended a maligned animal, they inevitably addressed the extent to which that animal helped or hindered people. In an article advocating the exploration of backyard insects, Edwin Way Teale assured readers that "com- paratively few" were "injurious" and that "many are beneficial." Another contribu- tor asserted that spiders were "true friends of man" since "a spider's entire life is devoted to snaring and devouring insects which might otherwise multiply and desolate the earth." Writer after writer echoed the same theme. Hawks seldom "preyed on chickens or speedy game birds," but instead waged "a ceaseless war on rodents and destructive birds, and on insects." Eagles seldom killed sheep or poultry or wild birds aside from the "unvalued" scoter, instead feeding largely on fish they found "already dead," not live ones that anglers sought. Pelicans avoided fish sought by commercial fishermen, choosing instead varieties that were "either abundant or commercially worthless." Mammals, too, pursued food in such a way as to comple- ment rather than to compete with humans. Raccoons killed mice and saved "thou- sands of trout, bass and other game fish by consuming turtle eggs." The land otter-"Man's Most Playful Friend"-did not "feed primarily on game fish" and actually attacked and killed "the fish-destroying lamprey." These animals deserved respect and deserved to live largely because they served very tangible human ends.24 But serving human ends did not necessarily save animals from death at human hands. By the 1950s, North Americans exploited animals for food and clothing more than ever before. Of course, subscribers to Reader's Digest in this period were less likely to hunt wild game or to slaughter farm animals than their grand- parents had been. Farms increasingly resembled huge factories, and animals sub- sisted not in the barnyard, but in small enclosures in which attendants regularly inserted food painstakingly designed to ensure maximum growth at minimum cost. All of this occurred, for the most part, out of the public's eye. The magazine did not dwell on this highly instrumental form of human-animal interaction, but it clearly did not object to it. Henry A. Wallace, the former vice president, de- scribed hybridization as "the joy of working with nature to create something new, something better," farm animals and plants that would "be of higher quality and far more productive." Other contributors spelled this out in greater detail. The "Super-Chicken-i954 Model" showed how "scientific breeding" had made chickens available for dinner year-round. The modern bird was "meatier, juicier, more tender and pleasing to the eye," while its cost remained thesame. Another article described how Maurice Paul Moore of Mississippi had used selective mating to develop "reproduction 'machines,"' cattle that other breeders used to improve their herds. These cattle put on weight easily, particularly in the parts of their bodies that people found tastiest.25 Reader's Digest seemed much more comfortable with the massive manipula- tion and slaughter of farm animals than with more occasional kills in the woods. George Fichter began his article on mink by recalling the winter day when he found one in a trap that he had set, gnawing at its foot to escape. Fichter, "ashamed" to have trapped such a courageous and defiant creature, set him free. From that mink's fervent desire to live," asserted Fichter, "I gained a deep respect and compassion for all living creatures, and I never set a trap again." He followed</page><page sequence="11">Animals in Reader's Digest 35 this with a description of how mink ranchers carefully bred and fed mink to pro- duce prime coats-a practice that Fichter did not seem to find the least bit objec- tionable-and he closed his article by noting that "domestication has not altered the mink's attitude toward man," for mink remained "savage beasts" who would "4gladly bite the hand that feeds it."26 Animals in the woods received much more compassion than animals in cages. William Cronon's environmental history of Chicago and its far-flung hinterland during the nineteenth century helps to explain why this was so. Developments in transportation and marketing served to distance pigs and cattle from the supper table. "In a world of farms and small towns, the ties between field, pasture, butcher shop, and dinner table were everywhere apparent," he notes. But in the new world of packing plants, refrigerated rail cars, and bloodless packages of meat, "it was easy not to remember that eating was a moral act inextricably bound to killing." This process began in the last half of the nineteenth century and was largely complete by the middle of the twentieth.27 The majority of Digest readers in the 1950S relied heavily on animals for food and for leather, yet most of them seldom met or killed those animals. The ani- mals that one did meet, or at least read about meeting, were apt to be encoun- tered as pets or in the woods. These animals were individuals, potential friends. Della Lutes recounted how she cared for Little Runt, a feeble pig born on her parents' farm. Her father repeatedly expressed his desire to eat the pig on Thanks- giving, but when the dreaded day came Lutes and her mother were relieved to find Little Runt still alive and another pig's carcass on their table in his stead. This sort of story was anachronistic at a time when the typical pig lived with thousands of others on highly specialized farms, a situation that permitted Alice Haines-in "I Like Pigs"-to move smoothly from a discussion of their intelli- gence and fastidiousness to a celebration of their nutritional and economic value, largely because she avoided describing a relationship with a particular pig.28 In the world of Reader's Digest, even machinelike farm animals ultimately shared dogs' love for people. In "Salute to Bossy," Elsie McCormick described modern cows as "really a man-made milk machine," that succeeded due to "man's intervention with better food, care and selective breeding." She quoted a profes- sor of dairy husbandry on cows' need for friendship: "If she is spoken to affection- ately and handled with gentleness and patience, her milk production increases surprisingly."29 Mink ranchers also spoke lovingly of their animals. An account of the Fromm brothers, owners of a huge fur ranch in Wisconsin, described how and why one brother began concentrating on mink rather than foxes: "You can get close to mink.... When you catch a fox, that scares him away from you for good. Mink-you can catch them, turn them loose, and they'll come back and peek around the corner at you."30 This closeness did not interfere with raising the captivating creatures to be killed for their pelts. When humans used animals to produce a useful product, be it more succulent cuts of meat or more splendid fur coats, the creatures remained faithful friends (hence an article on animal experi- mentation, including an experiment in which rats were "held at slow-starvation levels," demonstrated "man and animal joining together").3'</page><page sequence="12">36 Environmental History No contradiction seemingly existed in celebrating animals' friendship and in systematically exploiting them. So resolutely did all but a few animals seek hu- man approval and satisfy human ends that one could hardly speak of them form- ing an intent or purpose of their own. Animals willingly served humans in whatever fashion people desired. Exploitation coexisted with intimacy. Indeed, some writ- ers suggested that wild animals achieved their noblest purpose when the men who loved them snuffed out their lives. One article described the life of Carl Akeley, a taxidermist who grew up thinking "of his dog and of the birds and mammals of the woods and meadows as his friends." This "love for animals" led Akeley to taxidermy. He developed a particular attraction for Africa and for years went there to gather "specimens." The American Museum of Natural History in New York featured his exhibits, including a herd of elephants and a group of gorillas. The carcasses of these wonderful animals that Akeley loved outlived him, and in cutting their lives short, it seems, he made them immortal. Donna Haraway argues that these creatures "transcended mortal life" in "a spiritual vi- sion made possible only by their death and literal representation." "Only then," she concludes, "could the essence of their life be present." Robert Ruark sounds a similar theme in his descriptions of big game hunting in Africa. The leopard he killed became "mine" and "looked even more beautiful in death than he had in the tree." To kill an animal cleanly and nobly, and to "imprison in your mind all the wonder of the day" while doing so, was to bring "immortality to a beast because you loved him." The taxidermist's craft and the hunter's memories be- queathed to animals a significance that mere existence could not.32 The men who most fully loved animals were often those who most fully sub- dued them. One account of Ted Helsett, a hunting and fishing guide in British Columbia, repeatedly made this point. The writer's assertion that Helsett had "learned to understand and love the big north woods" was immediately preceded by the observation that this man had "met the wilderness on its own terms and mastered it in a supreme test." Helsett could approach "his playful friends" the beavers as both companions and as pelts. Ruark noted that when professional hunter Harry Selby walked into his New York apartment "my antisocial boxer dog took one look at him and crawled into his lap." The more accomplished a man became at killing, the more animals seemed drawn to him. Violence mingled with friendship.33 Men, much more than women, dominated animals on the pages of Reader's Digest. Men hunted, trapped, and fished. They also knew more. A pair of ar- ticles by "John and Jean George" opened with Jean asking questions about how ducks kept water open in freezing temperatures and why birds seemed caged by invisible boundaries, questions that John answered readily and easily. John also exhibited a more detached view of nature than did his more sensitive wife. As a girl Jean, personalized her relationship with her falcon, Bad Boy, in a way that her brothers did not approve of. Indeed, females might more easily form inti- mate, nonviolent relationships with wild animals than males did. One book con- densation explained that the wife of a couple enjoyed the trust of wild animals</page><page sequence="13">Animals in Reader's Digest 37 because she did not kill them. But fearless and bloody mastery belonged primarily to men, a mastery that by no means precluded intimacy.34 A single thread ran through the magazine's accounts of doting dogs and snakes, of sociable musk oxen and mice, of soaring hawks and plodding cattle: animals, except for the malicious few, deeply cared for people. This caring was not based- as it had been and often continued to be among aboriginal peoples-on a bed- rock of reciprocity and mutuality. "Our Animal Friends" offered their friendship unconditionally, and humans had nothing to fear from them.35 Animals' purported solicitude for people in the popular mind apparently peaked at mid-century. Ralph Lutts's fine study of "nature fakers" demonstrates consid- erable sympathy for animals in popular culture very early in the ioos. Authors such as William J. Long wrote highly popular accounts of animals that dressed wounds and fractures and birds that tied elaborate knots in building nests. Such writers, Lutts points out, "promoted a feeling of fellowship with wildlife." Long's work influenced Alan Devoe, a naturalist who frequently contributed to the Di- gest in the 1950S. But Devoe and his contemporaries spent less ink on the ingenu- ity of animals and more on their love for humans than had the nature fakers a few decades earlier. Stephen Kellert, in a quantitative study of four twentieth- century newspapers, asserts that utilitarian attitudes toward animals, though pre- dominant throughout his study period, became less salient from the 1920S to the 1970s, particularly among urban readers. Kellert concludes that these findings suggest "a pronounced decline in exploitative and fearful attitudes toward ani- mals, and a corresponding increase in appreciative and emotionally neutral per- ceptions of nonhuman species."36 A comparison of Reader's Digest articles from the 1930S with a sample from the 1950S suggests the same broad trend. Writers during the Depression certainly celebrated the friendship of man and dog, but they seldom described the sort of intimate relationships between wild animals and people that their counterparts would at mid-century. A story about a pet crow expressed more irritation than affection for the disruptive bird. Akbar, a hawk taken from his nest at three months, remained aloof from his owner. Digest writers of the 1930S were relatively unsen- timental about animals. "King of the Badlands" described, without condemn- ing, the poisoning of an eagle that preyed on sheep in Australia. A rancher who recounted her battle to keep sheep alive during a difficult winter betrayed some attachment to the dim-witted and recalcitrant animals, but closed by emphasiz- ing the economic benefits of her struggle. Animals commonly served concrete, material needs, an attitude that permitted Archibald Rutledge to refer to anti- hunters as "parlor naturalists, and lollypop sentimentalists."37 Articles from the 1970s, by comparison, described close relationships between a broad range of animals and people. Dogs remained the quintessential animal friend. Interactions between wild animals and people were portrayed in a some- what less exuberant manner than they had been in the 1950s, but meetings be- tween humans and other animals could be profound. "Little Redbird," a hummingbird, brought himself to a photographer who had lost almost all of his sight and his desire to live. The depressed man marvelled at the sound of Little</page><page sequence="14">38 Environmental History Redbird's wings as he hovered inches from his face, the sensation bestowing upon the stricken man a sense of purpose and perception, "the gift of vision without sight," as his grateful wife put it. R. Wright Campbell's "Where Pigeons Go to Die," a Reader's Digest book condensation, wove together the courageous and deter- mined lives of a boy, his pigeon, and his dying grandfather. A 1978 piece by Loren Eiseley, who had written about animals for the Digest in the 1950s, recalled a miraculous romp with a fox pup, an episode that was "the gravest, most meaningful act I shall ever accomplish." Such animals were not exactly doglike, but like their earlier counterparts, they offered priceless gifts of insight, of comfort, of friend- ship.38 The animals of Reader's Digest befriended humans at a time when humans were becoming evermore estranged from each other and from the rest of the world. Eiseley's frolic with the young fox meant that "we were the innocent thing in the midst of the bones, born in the egg, born in the den, born at last in human guise to grow coldly remote." Animal friends offered primal innocence in a world grown cold and empty. "We tap on the aquarium glass in the hope of the slightest acknowledgment," writes Paul Shepard, "or bang on the cages hoping for a crust of attention" because "we await a reunion with absent beings on a crowded yet increasingly lonely planet."39 The creation and celebration of animal-human friendships have clearly been rooted in concrete historical changes. Prosperity and suburbanization went hand- in-hand in the years following World War II. A robust consumer culture led to social atomization for middle-class housewives and organization men alike, yet, as Samuel Hays points out, consumption became increasingly oriented toward "qualitative experiences," including "environmental quality." The postwar sub- urbs spoke to this desire by featuring backyards, trees, and curvilinear streets. While the suburban life-style depended on a thoroughgoing domination of na- ture, on the destruction of animals and animal habitat, this dominance was well disguised, for suburbia connoted a harmonious relationship with animals, a Reader's Digest world of beneficent backyard insects, plucky birds, and loyal dogs.40 But this friendly interaction very much transpired on human terms. Dogs - and animals that imitated dogs-dedicated themselves to pleasing people. Spi- ders and other maligned animals deserved respect because they served human ends. Animals on industrial farms cooperated happily in their extreme subjec- tion to human needs and desires. Animals found fulfillment not among them- selves, but in being loved by a person-particularly a boy or a man-even if that love entailed or required killing. Dominance over animals was nothing new in western culture. Much of western civilization's ability to manipulate the environment sprang from an intense desire to subdue and control the rest of the natural world, including other animals. Over time, this explicit struggle with nature subsided, but nature did not simply become less threatening, less capable of inflicting damage. It changed sides. Mastery con- sisted not only in the ability to control the lives of animals, but also in the ability to redefine nature as an instrument to serve and please humans. Nature no longer</page><page sequence="15">Animals in Reader's Digest 39 stalked about outside the village as a menacing threat. "The friendly wild" was a social, human-centered community. It is not necessarily a paradox that the twentieth-century west has simulta- neously degraded and celebrated the environment, that the extreme subjection of animals, the extinction of species, and the erosion of habitats have been ac- companied by a popular embrace of animals, particularly wild ones. Roderick Nash illustrates that Americans became more favorably disposed toward wilder- ness as they more fully subdued it. But "wilderness" and "nature" have not sim- ply been biological facts; they have also been human constructions. Early policies at Yellowstone National Park called for eliminating predators, and the more re- cent nature lover visiting Island County, Washington, "approached the natural world as if he sought to furnish the island much as he would his living room, including what he liked, discarding what he didn't." Sometimes even the most beloved animals had to be hunted down. Haraway points out that Akeley needed to kill and mount his immortal gorillas because "only then could the hygiene of nature cure the sick vision of civilized man." Nature healed the ills of overcivi- lized man, but this nature revolved around the needs of humans, not animals.41 The subjection of nature, of the wild, of the animal has been discursive as well as material. When dogs are consumed by the desire to serve their masters faith- fully and nondomesticated creatures yearn to be dogs, the word "wild" becomes so plastic that measuring historical shifts in human appreciation for it becomes problematic. The content of Reader's Digest suggests that modern Westerners have not so much made their peace with the premodern or early modern wild as they have redefined or even eliminated it from their imaginations. Human understandings of other animals are unavoidably anthropocentric. Who knows what thoughts transpire in the mind of a dog, a hawk, a fox? But as the world untouched by human hands grows smaller, as nondomesticated animals grow more scarce, as our control over the lives of animals becomes still more complete, it may be wise to pause long and thoughifully before presuming to know their thoughts and their intentions. "Wild animals are not our friends," asserts Paul Shepard. "We cannot force them into barnyard conviviality or house- hold banality without destroying them."4&gt; David Peterson del Mar is an Associate Professor in the HistoryProgramme at the University of Northern British Columbia.

Stephen Kellert, drawing on a quantitative analysis of several twentieth-century U.S. newspapers, cau- tions that the modern "shift toward a 'nonconsumptive' and less pragmatic relation- ship to animals should not be unduly emphasized."

Keith Thomas observes that people have grown more sentimental toward animals, that even "nature parks and conservation areas" serve as "fantasies which enshrine the values" of a harmonious, considerate relationship between humans and other creatures, even as western societies as a whole continue to exploit animals for food and other uses as relentlessly as ever.

It seems that a purely quantitative study of four newspapers is useful more for its treatment of broad trends, which I have noted in the text, than for its more par- ticular measurements, which could be affected by such extraneous variables as the adding or dropping of columns on such topics as hunting, animal husbandry, or pets due to the availability of columnists or the decisions of other newspapers. 37.
