<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Kinsley "THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS": DIVINE MADNESS IN THE HINDU RELIGIOUS TRADITION INTRODUCTION A curious theme pervades Hindu mythology. It is the theme of divine madness. In all three primary mythological traditions, or in the three most significant "accents" within Hindu mythology- the Saivite, Vaisnavite, and Sakta-the gods and goddesses are often called mad or are described or portrayed as acting as if mad. Perhaps not surprisingly madness is also seen to be a typical characteristic of many Hindu saints, while certain cults or sampraddyas seem to inculcate acting as if mad or are typified by mad behavior among their adherents. The purpose of this study is to focus upon the theme of divine madness, in both its mythological and cultic settings, in an attempt to discern what truths this theme reveals about both the Hindu vision of the divine and the Hindu vision of salvation. My approach will be both descriptive and interpretive. I shall first attempt to convey the nature of divine madness in the mythology, or the cult, and shall then suggest what this theme might reveal or imply vis-a-vis Hindu spirituality. As my purpose is to articulate a general pattern of behavior in both mythology and cult and to suggest an overall religious intention as implicit (if not explicit in 270</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions some cases) in the theme of divine madness, I shall not dwell on precise terminology, the varying and subtle connotations of certain terms, for example, that can mean both madness and intoxication, or attempt to show the history of terms denoting madness in the materials I shall discuss. The purpose of this study is not so much to discuss madness per se in the Hindu tradition as it is to discern and comment upon a type of behavior that seems central to both Hindu mythology and cult and is frequently, but not always, called mad. The type of behavior so called may be circumscribed or bracketed for study and shown to be of a fairly consistent type without digressing on exact terminology, which admittedly varies. My interpretive approach is probably best described as that of a historian of religions, or a phenomenologist of religions. Insofar as this approach might suggest explicit comparisons, or the seeking of seemingly universal patterns in man's religions, however, this study will depart from that method, as I am primarily inter- ested here in understanding divine madness in the context of Hinduism alone and shall take my primary interpretive clues, or interpretive direction, from the Hindu tradition itself. That is, in trying to discern the "essence," or "intention," of this pattern of behavior, I shall seek to show how divine madness amplifies, articulates, or embroiders upon certain well-known and funda- mental truths of the Hindu religious tradition and thus may be understood as part of a wider, coherent spiritual vision. I shall not be intent upon suggesting possible social, psychological, or historical interpretations of divine madness, although I admit that such interpretations are relevant to any study of religious things. I am primarily interested in divine madness as a religious phenom- enon and so shall employ specifically religious categories (or Hindu religious categories) in seeking to understand it. I. THE MADNESS OF THE GODS While it is true that some Hindu deities are characterized as wilder, more tumultuous, more outrageous than others, and while it is true that some Hindu gods are more frequently called mad and are more frequently pictured as acting out of control than others,' it is also clear that it is usually not very difficult to find 1 Siva and Kali, for instance, are more typically described as mad than the more staid deities such as Rama, Visnu, and Durga, and as such express more clearly the theme of divine madness. 271</page><page sequence="3">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition examples of almost any important Hindu deity being described as mad2 or as acting in mad, apparently uncontrolled ways. Among the many Hindu gods Visnu is probably portrayed as the most consistently benign, sober, and predictable in his actions. He is typically described as the sustainer of the world, the protector of cosmic order, as that deity who does yeoman service on behalf of a world periodically threatened by chaos. He is the one god who can be counted upon to descend from time to time in various forms (avatdras) to champion the cause of the oppressed or to uphold the just cause.3 It is not misleading, perhaps, to describe Visnu as the cosmic policeman of the Hindu pantheon in this role. Yet even Visnu betrays occasional strains of wildness that hint of a dimension to his nature that is mad, that is unpredictable, at times frightening. In the Bhdgavata-purdna, Visnu, the champion of order, the benign protector, is petitioned as follows: "May the Almighty Lord... whose loud and violent laughter reverberates in the etherial space and causes miscarriage in pregnant women,- protect me."4 Generally, Visnu's avatdras appear in order to restore the stability of the world, to thwart powerful demons who have usurped the rule of the lesser gods, and to preserve and maintain cosmic and moral order. From time to time, however, these avatdras seem to lose control and turn on the world in fits of uncontrolled frenzy that threaten to destroy what they have come to protect. In the Kdmikagama the familiar story of Visnu's man-lion avatdra is told. Visnu appears in the form of a man-lion and kills the demon Hiranyakasipu, who has oppressed the world and usurped the lesser gods. After killing the demon by tearing him apart, however, Narasirha goes wild and begins to destroy the world. In the end, Siva appears on the scene in the form of 8arabha (a winged, two-headed being, with eight lion legs and a long tail) and slays Narasirha, the would-be redeemer gone wild.5 A mantra in the Agni-purdna, addressed to Narasirhha, invokes a presence that is eerie, wild, and dangerous. 2 "Mad" is used here to describe a general type of behavior that is typified by tumultuous and unpredictable actions and that will become clear in the course of this essay. Such behavior is frequently called mad in the texts. 3 A cursory glance at the Visnu Sahasranama (Mahabharata, Anusasana Parva, 149), perhaps the most famous celebration of Visnu's attributes, makes clear his sober, benign character. In this list of his thousand names he is almost entirely lacking ferocious or frightening aspects. 4 Bhdgavata-purana 6. 8. 14; The Srimad-Bhagavatam of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, trans. J. M.

Preserve me 0 Vishnu, from all dangers and incantations.6 In the Kdlikd-purdna, the myth of Visnu's boar avatdra is told. The goddess Earth has been submerged in the cosmic waters by a demon, and Visnu plunges to her rescue in the form of a boar. He defeats the demon, rescues Mother Earth from her watery prison, but then proceeds to rape her. In distress she cries for help, and Siva appears in order to save her.7 Krsna, perhaps Visnu's most famous avatdra, who is so adept at creating frenzy in others, particularly as a beautiful cowherd youth in the forests of Vrndavana, also seems to lose control sometimes. In a very curious episode just before his death, Krsna and Balarama (his elder brother) are described as slaughter- ing to a man their own race, the Yadavas. Because of excessive drink, or Destiny, the Bhdgavata-purd.na tells us, the Yadavas began to fight among themselves and even attacked their foremost leaders, Krsna and Balarama. Krsna and Balarama in turn became enraged and slaughtered every one of their kinsmen in an orgy of uncontrolled violence.8 One more example should suffice to indicate that Visnu, mighty preserver and protector of order that he is, sometimes reveals an aspect that is chaotic, seemingly uncontrolled, un- predictable-an aspect that suggests divine madness. In the Goraksa-siddhanta-samgraha there is a myth that tells of the 6 Agni-purdna 63. 3; Agni Puranam: A Prose English Translation, trans. Manmatha Nath Dutt Shastri, 2 vols. (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1967), 1:229. 7 Kalikd-purdna, chaps. 30. 1-42, 31. 1-153; cited in Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, "Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva," History of Religions 8, no. 4 (May 1969): 311. 8 Bhdgavata-purdna 9. 30. 11-25. 273</page><page sequence="5">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition origin of twenty-four Kapalikas.9 Once upon a time, we are told, Visnu's twenty-four avatdras'0 became intoxicated with pride. The boar, man-lion, and others began to split the earth. They frightened animals, oppressed towns, and did other mischievous things. Krsna was filled with adulterous emotions, and Parasurama slaughtered a host of ksatriyas to punish the sin of only one. Siva became angry at this and assumed the form of twenty-four Kapalikas. The Kapalikas decapitated the avatdras and carried their heads around in their hands, and thus the Kapalika sect was begun.1l Siva himself, the hero of order in two of the above myths, also betrays strains of uncontrolled wildness on many occasions, quite in keeping with his overall nature. Generally, Siva's mythological descriptions convey the picture of an unkempt, untamed being who lives on the periphery of civilization.l2 He is frequently said to mock "establishment" values and institutions. Perhaps the best known examples of this are his destruction of Daksa's sacrifice and his seduction of the rsis wives in the Pine Forest. He wanders the cosmos naked, minimally dressed, or attired in wild-animal skins; he haunts cremation grounds, covers his body with ashes, and is frequently said to be accompanied by an entourage of ghouls. He is appropriately associated with the destruction of the universe, and generally he suggests much more clearly than Visnu the nature of divine madness. The following description is based on Puranic sources, and is not the least exaggerated: "He laughs, sings and dances in ecstasy, and plays on a number of musical instruments; he leaps, gapes and weeps and makes others weep; speaks like a mad man or a drunkard, as 9 The Kapalikas were a ~aivite sect that seems to have originated in South India sometime before the sixth century A.D. (see David N. Lorenzen, The Kapalikas and Kdldmukhas: Two Lost Saivite Sects [New Delhi: Thomson Press, 1972]). 10 The number of Visnu's avataras is usually given as ten. For a discussion of Visnu's avatdras and the contrasts between various lists in traditional texts, see Mahamahopadhyaya Pandurang Vaman Kane, History of Dharmaistra (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1941), 2: 717-24; (1962), 5, pt. 2: 992-99. 11 Cited in Lorenzen, p. 38. It is very likely that sectarian bias is at work in this myth and the myth of Visnu's boar avatdra from the Kdlikd-purdna. Vaisnava sources themselves, however, also portray Visnu or his avataras acting in wild, mad ways, so it would be an exaggeration to suggest that Visnu only betrays madness in texts that seek to belittle him. I suggest below, in fact, that madness is hardly a negative attribute of deity in Hinduism but, on the contrary, a positive mark of transcendence. 12 In her article, "The Origin of Heresy in Hindu Mythology" (History of Religions 10, no. 4 [May 1971]: 271-333), Wendy O'Flaherty gives several ex- amples of Siva being condemned as a heretic, and the reasons given are almost always because of his peripheral, outrageous nature (see esp. pp. 318-25). 274</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions also in sweet voice.... He dallies with the daughters and wives of the rishis; he has erect hair, looks obscene in his nakedness and has an excited look."13 The Tamil Saivite saint, Nampi Arurar (popularly known as Sundarar), dwells at length upon 8iva's odd behavior and appear- ance and does not hesitate to refer to him as pitta, the mad one.14 He describes Siva as surrounded by idiots, epileptics, and crowds of grotesque peys and bhatas, ghosts or ghouls who haunt cremation grounds and are known for their frightful appearance and dis- gusting habits. With the peys and bhutas Siva sings and dances in the cremation ground, smears himself with ashes from funeral pyres, and refuses the entreaties of his devotees to quit his mad antics.15 The impression left by Nampi Arurar is that this behavior, while it is to be understood as only part of a complex portrait of deity that includes milder dimensions, is not in any sense an aberrant or insignificant aspect of Siva but is something intrinsic to his nature. Siva's wild behavior, his "inauspicious" appearance and habits, cannot, it seems, be disregarded without caricaturing the nature of his presence. In the Mahimnastava and the Siva Sahasrandma, two of the most popular celebrations of his attributes, his strange nature is not glossed over but is affirmed, even though it may not be fully understood. The following two verses from the Mahim- nastava, for example, describe his wild nature and close with comments of perplexed wonder: The earth suddenly fell into peril as you stamped your foot; the ether, full of the host of constellations scattered by your flailing arms which were like iron bars, was also in peril, the sky shook again and again as its curving sides were struck by your matted hair flying loose while you were dancing to save the world. Is not your power a perverse one? Your sport is in burning grounds. O destroyer of Smara; Pisacas (who eat the flesh of human beings) are your companions; ashes from a funeral pyre are ointment for your body; and your garland is a string of human skulls- though your character and your name as well are wholly inauspicious, yet, O gift-bestower, to those who call you to mind you are the supreme symbol of fortune.16 13 Rao, 2, pt. 1: 43. 14 M. A. Dorai Rangaswamy, The Religion and Philosophy of Tevaram (Madras: University of Madras, 1958), bk. 1, p. 396. 15 Ibid., bk. 1, pp. 397-403. 275</page><page sequence="7">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition The Siva Sahasrandma,17 while insisting upon Siva's role as boon-bestower, dispenser of grace and salvation, and upholder of order in its invocation of his thousand names, also calls him the bearer of a skull, a night wanderer, the one clad in rags, the one covered with ashes, the ugly and fierce one, and he who disguises himself as a lunatic. That is, there is a "dark," eerie, wild, sur- prising side to Siva that is insisted upon by his devotees, a dimension that may be incomprehensible and frightening but that is affirmed as essential to the great god's nature. Not surprisingly the theme of the redeemer-god gone wild or out of control (mentioned above vis-a-vis Visnu) is found with Siva in the starring role. Two examples will suffice to illustrate this theme in Saivite mythology. The Siva-purdna tells the myth of Jaladhara. Siva is summoned by the gods to destroy the castles of three asuras who are terrorizing the worlds. Siva destroys them with the fire from his middle eye. After the asuras have been consumed, however, the destructive fire emitted from Siva's eye takes on independent being in the form of Jaladhara. After an involved plot, it is Jaladhara who tries to usurp Siva and rape his wife, Parvati. Siva's world-redeeming fire, that is, has gotten out of control and must be destroyed by Siva when it returns to threaten the god himself.18 In the Garuda-purdna Siva creates the matrkas, a band of ferocious goddesses, in order to destroy the asura Andhaka. The matrkas perform their task admirably, but then threaten to devour the entire creation in their frenzy. Siva is forced to call upon Narasirhha, who appears on the scene and frightens the goddesses from their destructive purpose.19 The impression one begins to get of Siva is that he is in some sense either aloof from, or indifferent to, the orderly processes of the cosmic and social order. Indeed,there are even indications that in his madness he is antagonistic to the world, or that he at least takes a perverse pleasure in disrupting the cosmic order. In his Mindksi-amman Pillaittamil, the seventeenth-century Tamil poet, Kumaraguruparar, pictures the goddess Minaksi, the consort of Siva, as a child and describes her as the patient and playful creator of the world. She carefully and lovingly builds 16 Verses 16, 24 in The Mahimnastava or Praise of Shiva's Greatness, ed. and trans. W.

Siva, however, is pictured as frustrating her purpose by repeatedly arriving on the scene and destroying what she has so carefully built. The crazy old madman (mattap perum pittan) stands in front, dancing, destroying the beautiful little house that you have built in play. You don't become angry, but every time [he destroys it] you build it again.20 In a variety of devotional poems, Siva is openly described as mad. Tulsi Das calls him "this monstrous lunatic" and "Master Simpleton."21 In a Bengali Sakta hymn, whose theme is Durga's refusal to stay with her family longer on her annual visit to her parental home,22 she gives as her reason Siva's (her husband's) inability to look after himself in his drug-induced madness. You forget me, Mother, and all that I endured with my mad husband. Bhola is ever laughing and weeping and knows no one save me. He is always eating hemp, and I must stay near him. I cannot keep from worrying and wondering if he is safe or if any harm has come to him. I have to lift his food up to his mouth, or he would forget to eat. There is nothing left of me, I am spent with worrying about this madman. I put him at his ease and came away, and then what floods of tears I shed, Mother. For I was fearful lest he go off alone and none is so careless of himself as he.23 In one last example, Ramprasad Sen, an eighteenth-century Bengali Sakta saint, celebrates the mad god in the following way: Siva, the Supreme Good, is inebriated with hemp; His big eyes are half-closed. Strammonium flowers are stuck to His ears; He is white as silver; a tiger's skin hangs from His waist. He blows a horn and rattles a small drum And strikes His cheeks, and makes peculiar sounds. 20 Translated from Tamil for me by Professor K. Sivaraman, Department of Religion, McMaster University. The theme is repeated in the Saundaryalahari, verse 2, where the devi is said to create the world from a speck of dust, only to have Siva shatter it and use the remains to dust himself with ashes (see Sankara- carya, The Saundaryalahari: or, Flood of Beauty, ed. and trans.

One of Siva's epithets is virupaksa (with slanting, dreamy, or half-closed eyes), that is, one who has taken bhang, a type of marijuana (see Principles of Tantra: The Tantratattva of Sriyukta Siva Candra Vidyarnava Bhattacarya Mahodaya, introduction, Arthur Avalon and ~riyukta Barada Kanta Majumdar, 3d ed. [Madras: Ganesh &amp; Co., 1960], p. 553). It is also interesting to note that one of ~iva's favorite offerings is dhatuird, a plant that causes, or is believed to cause, madness. I am grateful to Professor K. Sivaraman for mentioning this to me. 277</page><page sequence="9">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition The Ganga flows with a murmur in His matted hair; terrific serpents hiss. The Supreme Yogin is absorbed in meditation; a painted mark adorns His forehead; a fire glares there. Nandi and Bhrngi are very wanton; His attendants are hosts of pramathas! They dance in accord and in disaccord, stamping their feet wildly.24 In the mythology of the Sakta tradition, or in myths featuring various goddesses, divine madness is also a clear and frequent theme. In the Lalitd Sahasrandma, a well-known list of the devi's attributes, she is repeatedly referred to as beautiful, gracious, and bounteous. Her supreme power is extolled, and she is exalted even above Siva and Visnu. As mistress of the universes, however, she is not without her wilder, frightening aspects. She is, for example, described as the one who sits on a throne of five corpses (name number 249), as the terrible one (276), as the destroyer of the universe (268), as the destroyer of Daksa's sacrifice (600), as drunk with the wine of dates (333), as having rolling eyes (431), as intoxicated, or maddened, with wine (575), and as drunk (or intoxicated) (mattd, 576).25 While the goddess is not called mad directly in this famous recitation of her qualities, these names hint at an uncontrolled and fearsome aspect of the goddess that is unmistakably clear in other texts. We find, for example, the following mantra addressed to an unnamed goddess, probably Camunda or Kali, in the Agni-purdna: Om, Hum, Kshoun, Hrum, Om, obeisance to the fierce-mouthed, horrid- jawed goddess .... Let thy diabolical laughter reverberate the atmosphere, 0 thou goddess with blood-shot eyes, shriek and sound, 0 thou goddess of infernal sound, and who art possessed of lightning tongues. Be manifest, 0 thou goddess, of extremely emaciated features. Put on thy mantle, 0 thou clad in the coils of the serpent known as Gonasha. Drive every thing before thee, oh thou who wearest a garland of dead human bodies. Yawn and open thy fierce mouth, oh thou goddess who art clad in raw hydes. Dance and dance with thy sword flashing forth lightning in all directions, with thy face made doubly fierce by sullen look and thy eyebrows arched in rage. Roar and roar, oh thou besmeared with the smelling fetid fat of dead bodies thou art fond of. Laugh and laugh, get furious and furious, oh goddess, shine forth in terrible splendour, oh thou coloured like the blue lightning and decorated with garlands of black cloud.

She is not the beautiful, voluptuous, sub- servient Parvati, Siva's consort, or the bounteous, auspicious Laksmi, Visnu's consort. She is a furious, wild shrew who is invoked for destructive purposes. Such goddesses are not un- common in the Hindu tradition. The divine feminine often specifies itself in unimaginably fierce and wild forms that dramatically depict divine madness. One of the most striking, almost shocking, forms of the divine feminine is that of Chinnamasta, the severed-headed one. She is a dramatic example of deity gone wild and out of control. Chinna- masta is pictured holding a bloodied sword in her right hand and her own severed head in her left hand. Three jets of blood spurt from her severed neck: two jets arch into the mouths of her female devotees, and the third flows into her own mouth.27 As the nourisher of the world, and particularly the nourisher of her devotees, the goddess has severed her own head so that they might sustain themselves on her lifeblood. In fulfilling her role as sustainer and maintainer of life, she has exhausted and destroyed herself. Among more well-known goddesses Kali is the one most often called mad and depicted as acting out of control. This black, naked goddess haunts cremation grounds, is surrounded by goblins and jackals, adorns herself with a garland of severed heads and a girdle of severed arms, wears infant corpses as earrings, howls diabolically, and, intoxicated on blood, dances 26 Agni-purdna 133 (1: 534-35). For other spine-chilling mantras addressed to various goddesses see chaps. 134, 135, and 136. 27 This aspect of the goddess is one of the ten forms (called the dasamahdvidyds) that Sati took to frighten Siva when he tried to prevent her from attending her father's sacrifice. Each form covered a direction of the cosmos, thus surrounding Miva. The story of Chinnamasta, in which she responds to the entreaties of her hungry devotees by severing her own head to feed them on her blood, is told in the Ndrada-pancardtra. A detailed description of Chinnamasta is given in Krsnan- anda Agamavagisa's Tantrasdra ("Dasamahavidya," in Vivalkosa, ed. Nagendra- nath Basu [Calcutta: Nagendranath Basu (1908?)], 8: 405-18). An illustration of Chinnamasta can be found in Ajit Mookerjee, Tantra Art: Its Philosophy and Physics (New Delhi: Ravi Kumar, Kumar Gallery, 1966), pl. 65. 279</page><page sequence="11">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition or reels out of control, threatening to destroy the world.28 Her devotees, who call her Mother and approach her as dependent children, do not hesitate to call her mad and celebrate in awe her fierce, wild, inauspicious nature. The poems of Ramprasad, one of her most famous devotees, proclaim, perhaps even boast of, her mad, unpredictable nature. All this is a girl's madcap pleasure, in whose enchantment the three worlds swoon into forgetfulness. She is mad, her lord is mad, his two disciples are mad. Her beauty and her nature, her gestures and her thought, surpass all speech. If one takes her name, one's happiness flames into ashes, and the burning pain of poison comes into the throat.29 O Mother! yours is an asylum of mad Beings. Of whose qualities shall I speak? Of two cowives of giva, one stands on His breast, and the other climbs on his head [Kali and Ganga, respectively]. Thy Husband is mad, O Mother Tara, Thou art the root cause of His madness. His two servants, who never live in human habitations, are constantly with Him. Thou, of low habits, O Mother Tara, ridest a bull instead of an elephant! Discarding gems and pearls, Thou wearest a necklace of human heads. Thou roamest wastes and cremation grounds; 0 Mother Tara! whom dost thou care for? Thou must save Rama Prasada from the grim ocean of birth and death.30 Although Kali is not associated with Siva as his wife or consort in the earliest texts that mention her,31 in the poems of Rampra- sad, and well before his time (eighteenth century), Siva and Kali are seen as a divine couple. How, when, and why the two deities were associated is not clear, but that they reflect and complement one another's wild, mad natures is clear. And together they epito- mize that awesome, tumultuous, unpredictable aspect of divinity that is commonly called mad. They are a remarkable couple and convey unambiguously a vision of the world controlled by beings themselves out of control. This last example of divine madness is sung by Surendra, a disciple of the famous nineteenth-century saint, Ramakrishna. 28 Kali's most popular image in Bengal is as Daksina-k&amp;li. She is described in this form in Krsnananda Agamavagisa's Tantrasdra; Brhat Tantrasdrah, 2 vols. (Calcutta: Basumati Sahitya Mandir, 1341 B.S. [1934]), 1:310-11. 29 Thompson and Spencer, no. 23, pp. 45-46. 30 Sinha, no. 207, p. 111. 31 The earliest texts that mention Kali are the Mahabharata and the Devi- mdhdtmya. Only in late, interpolated passages in the epic is Kali identified with Siva. In the critical edition the two are not related. This is also the case in the Devi-mdhdtmya. 280</page><page sequence="12">History of Religions Crazy is my Father, crazy my Mother And I, their son, am crazy too!

Shyama's streaming tresses hang in vast disorder; Bees are swarming numberless About her crimson Lotus Feet. Listen, as She dances, how Her anklets ring !32 The above examples provide us with a portrait of deity that may be characterized as mad in the sense of acting in outrageous ways or appearing in outrageous guises, acting so as to threaten the normal ways of the world or with something of indifference to the orderliness of the world, behaving in unpredictable, tumul- tuous, or wild ways, and acting in ways that are incomprehensible to a pragmatic, cause-and-effect understanding of reality. The gods seem mad, or are called mad, partly because their actions appear to lack a consistent intention (as when the savior god turns on the world he is supposed to redeem), partly because they behave as if totally absorbed in something "other" that is beyond normal comprehension (as when Durga complains that Siva is incapable of ordering his daily affairs with enough common sense even to feed himself), and partly because they seem to take a peculiar delight in superfluous activities such as dancing, drinking, and cavorting. They also seem mad, finally, because they sometimes seem to betray a perverse desire to bring about destruc- tion or chaos (as when Siva repeatedly destroys the worlds that his consort has so carefully molded or when Visnu's avatdras suddenly turn in fierce anger on those they have come to rescue). What does this mean? What does this pattern of behavior tell us about the Hindu vision of the divine? What truths does this aspect of divinity reveal to us about the Hindu vision of the Real which the gods participate in and express? The madness of the gods, first of all, suggests their freedom. This may seem a highly unlikely conclusion, given our usual understanding of madness as something that limits, binds, or irresistibly impels its victim, inhibiting or incapacitating him, somehow violating or impairing his wholeness. Vis-a-vis the gods, however, madness underlines their freedom not to behave normally, predictably, indeed, humanly (or even humanely). Their actions are not limited to a 32 M.

Swami Nikhilananda (New York: Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1942), p. 961. 281</page><page sequence="13">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition few choices, a few possibilities. They may, and often do, act in normal ways. But they are ultimately free to break the limiting confines of normality. The framework of normality cannot contain them. In their freedom they surprise and stun; their behavior does not proceed according to worldly motivations; it is not predictable; it is not customary; it is mad in its radical freedom. Second, the madness of the gods affirms their transcendence. Again, madness as we often understand it denotes an affliction that cripples, reducing its victim to a less than human state, locking its victim into a pattern of determined behavior we might call animal. In what sense does madness suggest transcendence? Divine madness suggests transcendence by affirming that the gods ultimately cannot be circumscribed by the mind of man. While the Hindu gods are often described in human form, in human settings, and as beset by human problems, from time to time they reveal aspects of themselves that boggle man's under- standing of them. They betray an aspect or dimension in some stunning or stupefying act that can only be appropriated by the devotee with wide-eyed wonder and astonishment. In the final analysis the gods do not consistently act according to the con- ventions of the world, nor do they behave at all consistently on behalf of, or even vis-a-vis, the world. They embody, or participate in, dimensions of reality that so transcend the world of predictable convention that they appear intoxicated or insane. In their transcendence of the world they appear wild, tumultuous, out of control-beings who in their transcendent freedom break the bonds of limited, traditional, boring, conventional, unimaginative accounts of the Real based on limited vision, based on the hum- drum world of cause and effect. Third, the madness of the gods suggests their aloofness from, or indifference to, the world, or to order generally (or to an order we can understand). In their madness the gods are often indifferent or inimical to the world order. They play with the world from time to time, distracted, as it were, with the dazzling thing they have danced or dreamed into existence. But surprisingly and unpredict- ably they will dash it to pieces or, withdrawing in meditation, will allow it to run down or sink into chaos. It is not that the gods are capricious, it is just that the world is incapable of exhausting their attention or their creative spontaneity. This aspect of divine madness, the aloofness or indifference of the gods to the world, serves to underline or reinforce both their freedom and their tran- scendence, as it suggests that the locus for understanding the 282</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions divine is not necessarily, and certainly not always, located in human understanding or discernible completely on the basis of man's world. The gods certainly do reveal themselves frequently as human creations, as when their wills or reflexes are directed to the creation and maintenance of the world, when they act on behalf of man and worldly order generally. Their aloofness and indiffer- ence, however, clearly show that their natures cannot be exhaus- tively understood in terms of their nurturing and nourishing the world and man within the world. Fourth, and finally, the theme of divine madness in Hindu mythology suggests the nature of the world to be ephemeral, impermanent, and only tenuously ordered. In their madness the gods reveal possibilities and realities that seem remote, fearful, threatening, and awesome. They suggest that the way things appear to be-permanent, predictable, manageable-is not the way things really are in an ultimate vision of the Real. The world, after all, rests upon, is created and governed by, or is in some sense dependent upon these beings who frequently betray strains of madness. As such the world is shown to lack an ultimate or apparent harmony, stability, and predictability. In the minds, or hands of insane beings it is revealed in all its phantasmagoric, fleeting aspects. The world is not, as it might be comforting to suppose, the be-all and end-all of a transcendent divine plan but an insignificant plaything of the gods, created in their sport or in their madness. The insane Kali, particularly insofar as she is seen as the embodiment, or mistress, of the phenomenal world, provides a dramatic symbol of a world uncontrollably reeling to its own destruction, intoxicated and blinded by a primal, ego-centred urge to multiply, diversify, and revel in the transient, material aspects of reality. The world man ordinarily affirms-the world of wealth, well-being, prosperity, material security, physical im- mortality, comfort, ego satisfaction-is revealed for what it is in the image of Kali: a distorted vision of reality grounded in a mad, insatiable, uncontrolled, blind, primordial need to glut itself in animal indulgence, a vision of reality that is indifferent to, or incapable of seeing, the truth that man's ultimate destiny tran- scends his phenomenal nature. The secret hope of man infatuated with the material world is that the pleasures of the physical have some transcendent, ultimate meaning in the eternal scheme of things; this secret hope that a smiling, benign will has arranged reality for the sole aim of human self-indulgence is cruelly mocked in the frightening, insane, eerie laughter of Kali, the mistress of 283</page><page sequence="15">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition death. If the world is ultimately governed by this mad, dark lady and her equally mad spouse, then the world is no symphonic harmony of bliss and light benignly maintained by a predictable divine will. The world is shown to be something that bumps and jerks along, careening almost out of control, subject to the stun- ning surprises of its mad master and mistress. As such, it is something that ultimately must be transcended in man's spiritual quest. It should be fairly clear that the above implications of that pat- tern of behavior I have called "divine madness" fit with a wider Hindu vision of reality. A few specific examples of how divine madness underlines or embellishes upon well-known aspects of the Hindu vision of the Real should illustrate just how comfortable the fit is. An important emphasis in Hindu philosophy is the insistence that the Absolute cannot be circumscribed. Brahman, we are repeatedly told by the advaita-veddntins, is nirguna, that is, with- out, or beyond, all gunas, qualities. The nirguna nature of the Absolute emphasizes in a negative way the truth that the other dimension of reality, in which all else is grounded, cannot be circumscribed, coherently or rationally understood, or existen- tially appropriated in its completeness no matter how heroically the mind or imagination is stretched. Divine madness, in a more positive way (or at least in a more dramatic way), says the same thing by insulting, shocking, and stunning the mind in its attempt to grasp the totality of this other, warning him who would dese- crate It by confining It through delimitation that such efforts are finally futile. This Absolute other is unspecified and can only be experienced in its totality through arduous sddhana, passionate devotion, or stunning grace. Another important theme in Hindu spirituality is lild-divine sport, play, or dalliance. Lila affirms that the gods are entirely complete, needing and desiring nothing. As such their actions are superfluous vis-a-vis their own essence. The raison d'etre (if we can use that term at all in this case) of divine action is aimless display, spontaneous expression. In their fullness the gods do not act to fulfill desires, to achieve specific ends, or even to please men. Their actions are as unpredictable, tumultuous, and dazzling as those of playful children. Lild also suggests an essential, inward aloofness on the part of the gods in relation to the ongoing order of the universe. The universe is, in the final analysis, their toy, something created in play for their amusement and delight, not as an end in 284</page><page sequence="16">History of Religions itself. The gods are mad because they act in unpredictable, spon- taneous, and surprising ways and betray a lack of consistent concern for, or preoccupation with, the world. Divine madness, insofar as it implies the essential instability of the world, reminds us, finally, of the centrality of sahmsara and mdyd in the Hindu version of reality. Samisdra is often taken to refer to reincarnation, which it certainly does. But samsdra has a more cosmic, naturalistic connotation. Samsdra means the "flowing together" and denotes the world as a vast ocean of flux and change, a vast ocean in which, or upon which, man floats from life to life in an endless round of births, determined for the most part by the actions of his previous lives (karma). While sarhsdra may convey a certain warmth, suggesting a vast womb in which all life floats together,33 it clearly suggests also, and primarily, the flux of life and the fleeting nature of individual, biographical histories. Vis-a-vis the spiritual quest, samsdra takes on the characteristics of a jungle rather than, or in addition to, a womb. Samsara is that which entangles the soul in its wild, lush vines and that which the spiritual seeker must transcend. Like the jungle, too, the world of samsdra is characterized by blind, seemingly uncontrolled growth and decay, a thicket of teeming life grounded in desire for survival and dominance that pulses seemingly out of control. It bubbles in a wild dance of creation and destruction that seems pointless vis-a-vis man's spiritual destiny. So the theme of divine madness tells us, too. Intoxicated or insane, the will or reflex that creates, sustains, and governs the world infuses it with a wild, unpredictable, tumultuous quality that seems pointless and clearly underlines the unstable, apparently aimless change that characterizes the world. The idea of mdyd, particularly in its meaning as supernatural skill or magical power,34 further reinforces the Hindu vision of the world as a fleeting, phantasmagoric creation, a display of the gods' "trickery." The gods conjure worlds into being, expressing their irrepressible creativity in dazzling displays of magical power. Spun into being by cosmic wizards, the world is a gossamer thing that lacks ultimate stability or ultimate intention. A speck of dust whirled into existence by the touch of Siva's dancing foot, 33 The warmth of samsdra is underlined in Paul Younger's Introduction to Indian Religious Thought (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1972) in a way that helps make sense out of the warm, voluptuous qualities of most of Indian art. 34 Mayd may also be understood as superimposition, man's reflex grounded in avidya that superimposes the limitations, prejudices, and habits of his own mind on the external world. In this sense mdyd is illusion. 285</page><page sequence="17">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition or a brief sequence in Visnu's cosmic dream, the world is a fleeting incident in the great gods' aimless cosmic display. If the world seems stable, permanent, predictable, comfortable, it is only so from a very limited point of view. The rhythm of Siva's dance will change, and the world will not be able to keep up with it; Visnu's dream will finally turn nightmarish, and the world will be threat- ened with chaos, or the great gods who may seem devoted to the well-being of the world will turn upon it in a fit of mad frenzy or playful abandon and conjure it out of existence while smiling enigmatically or howling in ferocious delight. The theme of divine madness, like the idea of mdyd, teaches him who would inherit his spiritual destiny that the world is not what it seems. There is no ultimate refuge in a world of illusory, fleeting, constantly changing images. The world may well amaze in its dazzling splendor, it may appear a sheer delight in its wonderful rhythms, but finally it must be glimpsed as the whirligig that it is: a delight for the spiritually immature, an aimless, unending, nausea- producing "trip" to the spiritually awakened. II. THE MADNESS OF THE SAINTS The above images of divine madness convey the truth of divine otherness, divine unpredictability and freedom. They suggest the truth that the world is ephemeral and fleeting in nature. They tend to disorient the man who grounds himself in a view of the world as guided by predictable beings and governed by manageable laws of orderliness, a view of the world as rooted in material well-being. The madness of the gods also seems to provide a paradigm for, or is characteristic of, the man who would see (or does see) truly. For it is abundantly clear that one of the tradi- tional marks of a Hindu saint35 is madness.36 This is particularly clear in the bhakti traditions of Hinduism. A variety of texts state that among the marks of a saint is madness or possession. In the well-known discourse on bhakti between 35 There is no traditional equivalent term in the Hindu tradition for the term "saint." Bhakta (which simply means "devotee") is used for the spiritually per- fected in most devotional traditions, while the terms sadhu (a holy man, generally), vairagi (one who has renounced), svami (master, lord), and paramahamsa (supreme swan, that is, one who has risen above the world) are used in varying contexts to describe the one who has triumphed spiritually. We will use the term "saint" throughout this section, however, for lack of anything better. 36 Again, as in the case of the gods, I am using the term "madness" in a general sense to denote a type of behavior that is typified by outrageous, wild, perverse, and abnormal actions. While this behavior is actually called mad in most of the texts I will cite, it is not always called mad. 286</page><page sequence="18">History of Religions Krsna and Uddhava in the Bhdgavata-purdna, Krsna says that anyone who becomes his devotee renounces the asramas and wanders free from the limitations of rules and regulations. His devotee plays like a child, behaves like a dolt, and talks like a maniac.37 The Caitanya-caritdmrta, the most popular account of the sixteenth-century Bengali saint, Caitanya, says that the one who has deep love for Krsna has no control over himself. He smiles, weeps, dances, and sings uncontrollably. He forgets himself and appears like a lunatic.38 In Mahipati's Santavijaya, a Marathi account of the seventeenth-century Marathi saint, Ramdas, the characteristic behavior of a spiritual superman is said to be like that of a child, like one possessed, and like one intoxicated.39 The frequency with which Hindu saints, particularly those of the various bhakti traditions, are described as mad, or describe them- selves as mad, makes it impossible here to note all occurrences of this type of behavior. A few examples from a variety of traditions and sampraddyas, however, will suffice to convey the nature of this behavior and show how typical it is of the Hindu saint.40 The sixteenth-century Rajputana princess and saint, Mirabal, was an ardent lover of Krsna. Traditionally she is said to have abandoned her life as a princess to live a life of complete devotion to Krsna, whom she considered her true husband. Her passionate devotion led some to call her mad. Mira danced with ankle-bells on her feet. People said Mira was mad; my mother-in-law said I ruined the family reputation. Rama sent me a cup of poison and Mira drank it laughing. I dedicated my body and soul at the feet of Hari. I am thirsty for the nectar of the sight of him. My Lord is Giridhar Nagar; I will come for refuge to him.41 37 Bhdgavata-purana 11. 18. 29. 38 Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Caitanya-caritdmrta, Madhya-lila 23. 21-22; 6Sri kri Caitanya-caritdmrta (Bengali), 5 vols.

While the Bengalis have been stereotyped as the "Irish of the East" by some, and therefore perhaps as more prone to madness, the number of examples cited from Bengal simply reflect my more general familiarity with this region of India. The number of examples cited from other areas of India, I hope, will convince the reader that divine madness is not simply a Bengali phenomenon. 41 S. M. Pandey and Norman H. Zide, trans., "Poems from Mirabal," mimeo- graphed (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1964), pada 36, p. 18. 287</page><page sequence="19">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition In another poem she describes herself as chronically intoxicated under the inebriating presence of her Lord Krsna. Friend, I am completely dyed this (i.e., Krsna's) color. I drank the cup of immortal bliss, and became drunk. My inebriation never goes away, however many millions of ways I try (to get rid of it).42 Several Maharashtrian saints either describe themselves as mad or in traditional accounts are so described. The devotee Gora (thirteenth century) says in one of his poems that in his contem- plation on God he thought he had gone mad. He says he lost all sense and felt as if he had been possessed.43 The famous seventeenth-century saint, Tukarama, says that one of the very first signs that appeared after he had had a vision of God was madness.44 In one of his songs Tuka describes the ideal devotee as one who is mad in the eyes of the world, and thus describes himself-a man who was mocked and pestered by his wife for his "foolishness" and behaved in strange, peculiar ways in his intoxication with his God. The devotee of God is dear to God alone. He cares not for others. He cares for no friends or companion. People might call him a mad man.... He lives in forests, and woods, and in uninhabited places. When he besmears his body with ashes after having taken a bath, people look at him and blame him. When he sits alone to himself with a rosary of Tulasi beads on his neck, people ask-Why is it that he has been sitting apart? He is not ashamed of singing nor of sitting anywhere he pleases, and his parents and brothers abuse him for his manners. His wife calls him names and says that it would have been better if that impotent fellow had died.... He alone can achieve the end of life, says Tuka, who has turned his back away from the world.45 Elsewhere Tuka describes his own madness specifically, suggesting that his madness, which manifests itself in lack of interest in the world, brings abuse from wordly people (a theme we shall discuss below). "Tuka indeed is a thoughtless madman, and is given to bragging. He is given to uttering of the Name of God, Rama, Krishna, Hari forever ... He listens to nobody, and dances naked in a Kirtana. He is weary of enjoyments, and wallows in uninhabited places. He cares not for advice, and says Vitthala, Vitthala. People criticise him variously, but he carries on his 42 Ibid., pada 40, p. 32. 43 R. D.

Spit on me, 0 learned men, says Tuka, for I am without learning."46 The seventeenth-century saint, Ramdas of Maharashtra, used to attract large crowds with his antics. He used to delight in play- ing games with children, and Mahipati, his biographer, says of him, after describing his play with children: "Thus Ramdas the crazy may, like Krishna in his avatara form, played with the boys, but was untouched by any fault."47 He wandered about the forests, and when he attracted crowds he would make faces at them, climb about in trees like a monkey, and break off branches and throw them at his "audience."48 Sometimes he would enter towns to beg his food. People would gather and remark on his appearance and odd behavior. "Samartha appeared in the town, and a crowd assembled to look at him. They remarked: 'It seems to us, his life is being spent uselessly. In appearance he is supremely beautiful. His age must be less than twenty five. One does not know with what demon or ghost he is possessed.' While they were talking thus, Ramdas increased his curious antics. He made faces at the people. This made the people exclaim: 'A mighty figure, indeed !' As Ramdas heard these remarks, he was made exceedingly happy. He rolled his eyes and made faces at the people."49 The theme of devotees being possessed, or acting as if possessed, by demons and ghosts is particularly clear in the writings of Karaikkal Ammaiyar and Nampi Arurar, two Tamil Saivite saints. Here the mad behavior of Siva's intoxicated devotees is compared with that of peys and bhatas. That is, his devotees in approaching him with devoted hearts become identified, as it were, with Siva's entourage-with the peys and bhutas. The saint, like the pey, cherishes what others loathe, acts in odd, wild ways, and precisely in so behaving seems to make himself dear to his Lord.50 Madness as a sign of the saint is also seen among the Tamil Vaisnava saints, the Alvars. The very name of Peyalvar suggests that he was mad, intoxicated by, or mad after God.51 In Kulasek- hara's Perumdl Tirumoli the author-saint longs for that time when he will dance and roll on the ground in ecstasy (1.1)52 and eulogizes other saints who have "become mad with devotion" 46 Ibid., no. 2090, p. 274. 47 Mahipati, Santavijaya5. 43-45, 49 (pp. 67-68). 48 Ibid., 5. 9-15 (p. 65). 49 Ibid., 5. 24-28 (p. 66). 50 Rangaswamy, 1:396, 401. 51 K.

Conversely, to the saints normal men seem asleep, dead, or mad in their insane quest after ephemeral pleasures (2.69).55 Sathakopa, popularly known as Nammalvar ("our" alvar), describes his "affair" with his God also in terms of madness.56 He says that the true devotee, who has passed beyond all states of consciousness by the grace of God, ought not to try to suppress those intense emotions that make him appear mad to the world. He should delight in his madness as that which marks him off from other men who have not been so blessed. "In that very madness," he says, the saint should "run, jump, cry, laugh and sing, and let every man witness it."57 Perhaps the most famous traditional account of bhakti saints, the Bhaktamdl of Nabha Das (seventeenth century), is full of examples of saintly madness. Krsnadas Sadhu, who lived in a cave, is described as being perpetually mad, enthralled with love for Krsna.58 Kharoga Sen, on the occasion of the Ras Lila, a festival held in the autumn to celebrate Krsna's circular dance with the gopis, was seized by love and began dancing like a madman. He danced so enthusiastically that he fell down dead. He was immediately translated to heavenly Vrndavana, where he entered the eternal Izld of Krsna with the gopis.59 Karametibai, the daughter of a brahman, is described as being repeatedly seized by the love of Krsna, during which she would break out in tears and laughter and behave like a madwomen.60 Bilvamangal, whose biography is a favorite theme of Bengali folk theater (jdtrd), is described by Nabha Das as being intoxicated day and night in his love for Krsna. When Krsna appeared to him he rolled on the ground in ecstasy, wept, sang, danced, and showed all the signs of being possessed.6' Vittaldas, finally, is described in the Bhaktamdl as particularly fond of kirtan (devotional singing in praise of Krsna). Whenever he heard or sang kirtan he would dance in 53 Ibid., p. 67. 54 Ibid., p. 68. 55 Ibid., p. 69. 56 Ibid., pp. 159, 189. 57 Alkondavilli Govindacharya, The Divine Wisdom of the Drdvida Saints (Madras: C.

On one occasion, he became so enthusiastic that he fell off the roof on which he was dancing. "Unconscious with the bliss of love, he could not control himself. After awhile he regained consciousness, yet he went on dancing like one completely forgetful of the external world. He danced under the spell of the bhdva (mood or emotion) of love (prema). He was not aware how his feet moved, where he was, or who was present. And on the sea of bliss flowing in his mind no trace of his normal life floated. Whooping and whirling, dancing and jumping up and down, he suddenly fell off the roof . . and survived without injury of any kind."62 Perhaps the most famous example of god-intoxication or god- madness is that of the sixteenth-century Bengali saint, Caitanya, the "reformer" of Bengal Vaisnavism. For Bengal Vaisnavas Caitanya is the paradigm for devotion, for he was Radha incar- nate, Krsna's beloved, and as such epitomized her frantic, frenzied, intoxicated love for the Lord. His life was one of continual fits of weeping and wailing, laughing, singing, and dancing in ecstatic love. His orientation to the phenomenal world was tenuous and almost nonexistent in the latter part of his life. He repeatedly fell unconscious, transported to heavenly Vrnda- vana, where he dallied with his beloved Krsna.63 Almost any mundane sight might remind him of some aspect of Krsna, Krsna's entourage, or holy Vrndavana, where Krsna dwells, and precipitate a fit of frenzy in which he would fall unconscious. When he saw the blue neck of a peacock, for example, he was reminded of his blue Lord and fell unconscious in ecstasy.64 When he heard the flute of a cowherd boy he forgot himself completely and fell on the ground in frenzy. His breath stopped, and he foamed at the mouth.65 In Puri (a famous Vaisnava cult center in Orissa where he spent most of the latter part of his life) he mistook Mount Chataka for Mount Govardhana of Vrndavana, ran toward it, and was overcome in ecstasy.66 Also in Puri he saw a flower garden and was immediately reminded of the bowers of Vrndavana where Krsna dallied with the gopis. He was seized with longing for Krsna and began searching for him, weeping and reciting verses from the Bhdgavata-purdna that tell of the gopis' search for 62 Ibid., p. 223. 63 E.g., Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Caitanya-caritdmrta, Madhya-lila, 14. 220; Antya-lila, 14. 11-14. 64 Ibid., Madhya-lila, 17. 204. 65 Ibid., Madhya-lila, 18. 151-52. 66 Ibid., Antya-lila, 14. 79-80. 291</page><page sequence="23">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition Krsna when he disappeared from their midst.67 Walking along the seashore in Puri, he mistook the ocean for the River Jumna, which flows through Vrndavana and in which Krsna played with the gopis. He jumped into the ocean to frolic with his Lord and was almost drowned.68 Caitanya, particularly in the latter part of his life, seems out of control. He cannot contain his intense, emotional feelings for Krsna, he is rent by conflicting moods that make him laugh in delight or weep in pain, he repeatedly falls to the ground in swoons of stupor, his emotions rack his body, he sings and dances continually, and he can barely take care of himself. He is out of this world, immersed almost totally in that other world of Krsna where he longs to be continually. At one point Krsnadasa Kaviraja sums up his condition by telling us Caitanya had three states: the fully absorbed, in which he was not of this world but totally immersed in dallying with, or longing for, Krsna; the half conscious, or half absorbed; and the fully conscious. In his fully conscious state, though, he showed hardly any interest in performing his daily duties and behaved like a machine (like the wheel of a potter, the text says, turning mechanically), taking no interest in earthly life but simply acting out of habit.69 Else- where, Krsnadasa puts the matter succinctly: "[Caitanya] sang and danced continuously as if he were mad, but he still prayed, bathed, and ate out of habit or instinct."70 "Overcome by ecstasy and madness, the Lord's heart would not be still. Everything he said and did was symptomatic of madness."71 Two examples of saintly madness from the Sakta tradition will complete our brief sampling of the theme of divine madness in the Hindu bhakti traditions. In their love for the goddess Kali, Ramprasad Sen and Ramakrishna, two of Kali's most famous devotees, either described themselves, or are described, as mad. O Mother Kali with a necklace of human heads! what magic hast Thou shown me! O Mother! thou didst teach me how to call Thee 'mother,' and make me mad by calling Thee 'mother' constantly. ...........................................................................

Honour and dishonour are all alike to me; I have cast aside maya, And may Thy rosy feet the be-all-and-end-all of my life; shall I be misguided by wordly people any more?72 For Ramprasad, madness was, it seemed, something to be cherished, a mark of a true devotee of the Mother and something possessed by all great saints. In the following poem, he invokes Kali to bless him with her redeeming madness: Make me mad, O Divine Mother! There is no use of knowledge and discrimination. Make me intoxicated with the wine of Thy love. O Mother! enchanter of the devotees' hearts! immerse me in the ocean of love. In this Thy lunatic asylum, some laugh, some cry, and others dance in excess of joy. Jesus, Moses and Chaitanya were, O Mother, unconscious in ecstasy of love. Alas! 0 Mother! when shall I be blessed, mixing with them? In heaven there is a fair of lunatics; there Master and disciple are alike. Who can fathom the mystery of the play of love? Thou are mad with love, O Mother, crown of lunatics! Make poor Prasada rich, 0 Mother, in the treasure of love.73 Ramakrishna's spiritual odyssey, particularly his devotion to Kali, is marked by periods in which he felt that he was hopelessly mad. In fact he was deeply concerned about his condition early in his career and only came to accept his odd behavior as a special mark of grace when a wandering holy woman from East Bengal assured him that his behavior was typical of great devotees such as Caitanya.74 Ramakrishna's behavior was unpredictable and frenzied, and he was prone to fall into fits of ecstasy suddenly and frequently. He is described in the following passage shortly after his marriage and his return to the Daksinesvar Temple, where he was temple priest: "His madness reappeared tenfold. The same meditation and prayer, the same ecstatic moods, the same burning sensation, the same weeping, the same sleeplessness, the same indifference to the body and the outside world, the same divine delirium."75 Later in life, when a small group of disciples had gathered around him, Ramakrishna told them that madness was 72 Sinha (n. 24 above), no. 165, p. 88; see also nos. 51, 91, and 182. 73 Ibid., no. 139, pp. 75-76. 74 M.

A perfect knower of God and a perfect idiot have the same outer signs."76 He suggested to his disciples that such attributes of madness as a lack of interest in the world and an element of naivete that permits foolish behavior are the results of meritorious actions in past lives: "There is such a thing as inborn tendencies. When a man has performed many good actions in his previous births, in the final birth he becomes guileless. In his final birth he acts somewhat like a madcap."77 Ramakrishna, of course, was describing himself: the naive, open, childlike village saint who behaved like a fool and a madman, overcome by and immersed in his spiritual escapades. Divine madness is not something limited to saints of the bhakti traditions, although it seems most typical of bhakti saints. Among such groups as the Saiva Pasupatas, the Tantric kauldcdris, and the Bauls of Bengal, madness, or acting as if mad, plays an impor- tant part in spiritual exercise (sddhana), or is clearly understood to indicate a state of high spiritual achievement. In the Pasupata work Gankdrika, a path of five stages is set forth for him who seeks duhkhdndm, the end of sorrow. The stages are the marked, the unmarked, victory, cutting, and cessation. For each stage there are appropriate locations and actions that characterize the adept's sddhana. In the second, or unmarked, stage the sddhaka dispenses with the characteristic marks of his sect, leaves the confines of the temple and the presence of his guru, and wanders among men. The characteristic behavior of this stage is an active encouragement of abuse and censure by the general populace. This is accomplished by performing various strange, mad actions. The Pasupata Sutra says the adept in this stage should wander like a preta (ghost); should smear his body with ashes and dirt like a poor man or a lunatic; should not cut his hair, beard, or nails; should pretend to sleep while awake; should tremble as if sick; should limp; should make amorous gestures at women; and should speak nonsense.78 He should, as the text puts it succinctly, "wander like a lunatic among the people at large."79 76 Ibid., p. 792. 77 Ibid., p. 783. 78 Pastupata Sutra 3. 11-17. 79 Ibid., 4. 6; Haripada Chakraborti, trans., Pdasupata Sutram with Paichartha- Bhd&amp;sya of Kaundinya (Calcutta: Academic Publishers, 1970), p. 140. 294</page><page sequence="26">History of Religions Madness as a mark of, or a means to, spiritual achievement is also seen among the kauldcdri Tantrikas. In his quest for liberation the Tantric sddhaka is said to pass through six stages (veddcdra, vaisnavdcdra, saivdcdra, daksindcdra, vdmacdra, and siddhdcdra), during which he attains greater and greater purity. Finally, he reaches the ultimate stage, called kauladcra, which is characterized by absolute freedom and total disregard for rules.80 The kauldcdri roams about the world sometimes as a man very civil and social and sometimes as a person who does not care for social customs and behaves as an outsider or outcaste. He sometimes behaves as a goblin, moving like an apparition, and he is dressed in different dress of many colours, whatever strikes his fancy. For the kauldcdri there are no fixed customs, rites, or rituals, and he learns to disregard totally distinctions in regard to place, whether it is holy or profane, to time, whether auspicious or inauspicious, to works, whether moral or immoral. He is a man who with a total sense of the final identity of things and with total detachment places everything on the same level: mud and sandalpaste, friend and enemy, home and the burial ground, gold, silver, and money and a piece of grass.81 A good example of the Tantric kauldcdri is found in the life of the nineteenth-century Bengali saint, Bamakhepa (Bama the mad). He was particularly partial to the goddess Kali and made his home in a cremation ground along the Dvarka River. This was the place where Bama used to carry on his sddhana. He himself was like the great yogin Siva: tall, dark, and completely naked. Due to the excessive use of wine and gdnja [a type of marijuana] his large eyes were the color of blood-red flowers. But to observant eyes he appeared what he truly was, a divine child, self-forgetful, with eyes sparkling with inner joy. To these eyes was revealed that divine child peeping out of his dark body. His companions were a pack of dogs, habitual dwellers in the crema- tion ground, who played all around him, completely unafraid of him. He, too, played with them, sometimes petting them and sometimes chasing 80 Swami Nigamananda Sarasvati, Tantrik Guru (Bengali) (Jorhat, Assam: Sarasvati Mati, 1959), p. 37; see also R. C. Majumdar, ed., The History and Culture of the Indian People, vol. 4, The Age of Imperial Kanauj (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1955), pp. 320-21, and Kuldrnava Tantra 2. 7, 8 for delineations of these stages. 81 Sarasvati, p. 37. Tantric texts themselves are somewhat ambiguous on whether the kauldcdri should disregard all rules. The Kuldrnava Tantra suggests, like the Pdsupata Sutra, that mad behavior should be consciously practiced by the kaulacdri, as it reinforces his renunciation of the world by turning the world against him. He should make no concession to worldly custom and sensibilities, that is (see Kuldrnava Tantra, introduction, Arthur Avalon [Sir John Woodroffe], 1st rev. ed. [Madras: Ganesh &amp; Co., 1965], pp. 67-68). In the Kauldvali-nirnayah, on the other hand, the kaulacdri is said to be all things to all men and to act like a Vaisnava in the company of men, although inwardly he is something else. The idea here seems to be that the kauldcdri should not purposely offend anyone (see Kauldvali-nirnayah, in Tantrik Texts, ed. Arthur Avalon [Calcutta: Sanskrit Press Depository, n.d.], 14:12). 295</page><page sequence="27">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition them away. When devotees came to have darsan [sight] of him, they were puzzled by his actions, which were like those of a child or a ghoul. He would sometimes ask those who came to see him, "Are you boys carrying any intoxicants with you? If so, bring them out, and let's have some fun."82 As for the Bauls, the very name means madness.83 They are minstrels who have given up life in the normal world to wander the countryside singing in praise of God. Their clothes are made from cast-off Muslim and Hindu rags patched together. They sing and dance wildly and are generally bizarre in appearance.84 Many Bauls bear the honorific title khepd (the mad one).85 An anony- mous Baul describes himself and his fellows as follows: According to the views of the world, there is no one so undesirable and unworthy as he. His heart is locked with feelings, he is as gay as [a] whirligig to the outside world. Cleaving wholly to his own nature, he laughs or cries, dances or begs as he wishes. Regardless of cleanliness or impurity, good or evil, his heart is carved in stone; but his life is a joy. People grind their teeth at him, turn him away from their doorsteps when he goes begging for a handful of rice. He has no right to talk back as he must discard all for the sake of God, accepting all as part of divine caprice. A tramp by nature and a beggar at that, he lives a strange life, almost insane, with values of his own which are contrary to those of others. His home being under the tree, he moves from district to district, all the year round, as a dancing beggar who owns nothing in the world but a ragged patch-work quilt.86 In the following poem, also anonymous, a Baul speaks of two types of madness: worldly madness, characterized by blind absorption in various phenomenal things, and a spiritual madness that comes only when one has transcended the artificial dualities of the world ("the fake and the fact"): 82 Bhdrater-sidhak (Bengali), ed. Sankarnath Roy (Calcutta: Writer's Syndicate, 1956), 1:239-40. 83 Edward C. Dimock, Jr., The Place of the Hidden Moon: Erotic Mysticism in the Vaisnava-sahajiya Cult of Bengal (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966), p. 250. 84 Each year the Bauls do manage to get together, wandering to the same place at the same time. At Jayadeva's birthplace in West Bengal, Kenduli, the Bauls gather on Jayadeva's birthday (in January) and celebrate the event with much singing and dancing. I attended this gathering in January 1969. 85 At the Kenduli mela (festival) it was interesting to hear Caitanya referred to as the greatest of the Bauls, the greatest of the madmen. The gist of a song sung by GopSldas Baul on the second night of the mela was: Caitanya was the Baul of Bauls, the best of Bauls. Caitanya was born in Navadvip to taste the love feel- ings of Radha. He was the greatest of the khepds, and Advaita, Nityananda (important figures in Bengal Vaisnavism, companions of Caitanya), and others joined in his madness, and he spread intoxication for God among all. 86 Deben Bhattacharya, trans., Songs of the Bards of Bengal (New York: Grove Press, 1969), pp. 42-43. 296</page><page sequence="28">History of Religions Mad, mad we are all mad. Why is this word so derogatory then? Diving deep into the heart's stream you will find that no one is better than the one who is mad. Some are mad after wealth and others for glory. Some go mad with poverty, and others with aesthetic forms, the flavours of feelings. Some are madly in love. And some of those who go mad only laugh and cry. The glamour of madness is great. Mad and mad! Madness does not grow on the tree- but only when the fake and the fact are meaningless- and all, being equal, are bitter-sweet.87 The above examples seem to indicate clearly enough that madness is in some way an indication of the spiritual hero, or is in some way efficacious in the spiritual quest. Why madness is understood as a typical sign of the Hindu saint and how madness, or acting as if mad, may be efficacious in seeking salvation are questions we shall now address ourselves to directly. There are five interrelated themes or truths suggested by the mad behavior of the saints that are suggested specifically from the examples cited, are implied in the context of Hindu spirituality generally, or seem implicit vis-a-vis our earlier discussion of the madness of the gods that I should like to discuss. First, and most obvious, I think, the madness of the saints, particularly the bhakta saints, suggests their total absorption in the divine. Nearly every example of madness among the bhakta saints underlines the fact that extreme or total devotion to God is so completely distracting, all-consuming, and passionate that the devotee, characterized by such single-pointed absorption, can barely cope with mundane reality and seems mad in his extreme infatuation. Nothing else matters but his obsession with God. He is, as it were, madly in love. He is possessed by the presence of his God totally 87 Ibid., p. 42. 297</page><page sequence="29">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition and cannot, or does not wish to be, cured of his divine possession.88 The mad saint lives in another (or an other) world, on another plane of reality, whose rhythms are different from those of the mundane world. He is off somewhere else, in a world of his own, we might say, indifferent to all else but the intoxicating presence of his God. The bhakta saint is mad, for he is out of this world: dallying with Krsna (or hopelessly miserable in his absence), dancing with Siva, trembling in awe or servitude before the majesty of Rama, or stubbornly clinging to Kali's feet, the bhakta saint is clearly somewhere else than in this world in which we ordinarily live. A second theme follows from this. The madness of the saint sometimes suggests, or is indicative of, his participation in, or imitation of, the God he adores, and as the ways of the gods are not always or even usually the ways of men, the saint appears mad like the gods themselves. The saint also appears mad because he participates in, identifies with, or imitates the mythical or legen- dary paradigms of devotion to the gods who also betray signs of madness. This aspect of divine madness among the saints is particularly clear when the deity the saint adores, or the paradigm the saint identifies with, is a characteristically frenzied figure such as Krsna, Radha, Siva, or Kali. The saint acquires the mark of that in which he participates, and the special mark of the gods and of the mythical lovers or companions of the gods is often madness. In this sense we can speak of the madness of the saints as a sign of divine grace. Krsna's presence (to illustrate this point), particularly the sound of his flute, sets the entire cosmos dancing in frenzied ecstasy. Even the gods stop what they are doing and are drawn to holy Vrndavana, where Krsna sports with his devotees. The gopis (lowly cowherd women who epitomize the ideal Krsna devotee), when they hear his flute, drop their household chores, abandon their homes, children, and husbands, and dash off to the glades of Vrndavana to frolic with and make love to their beautiful, dark Lord. The madness of Krsna devotees, to a great extent, stems 88 Glenn E. Yocum ("Shrines, Shamanism, and Love Poetry: Elements in the Elmergence of Popular Tamil Bhakti," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 41, no. 1 [March 1973]: 1-17) has argued that possession by a spirit or god was an important feature of pre-sixth-century A.D. Tamil religion. He then tries to show how possession by God in Vaisnava and Saiva bhakti in Tamilnadu became a central feature of these "new" cults. He cites several examples of divine madness among the Tamil saints and notes that the popular phrase in the writings of many Tamil saints, "the melting of the mind," indicates divine possession or denotes the bhakta's being completely overwhelmed by the deity. The phrase is particularly common in the Tiruvacakam of Manikkavacakar. 298</page><page sequence="30">History of Religions from their identification with (or imitation of) the gopis. As gopis they participate in the frenzied world of Krsna, and as gopis they are mad with love for their dark lover.89 This is dramatically clear in the case of Caitanya, whose madness was none other than Radha's madness. The point is also seen, although not as consistently, in the devotees of Siva and Kali. The Tamil Saivite saint, Nampi Ariirar, makes the point that those who adore Siva become part of his entourage, that is, they become like peys and bhutas. In their adoration for Siva they have come to include themselves (or have been included) among his constant companions, who are ghosts and goblins who live, play, and dance with Siva in the cremation ground. Like these strange companions of Siva, the saint behaves in bizarre and wild ways-becoming, indeed, like the god himself. The madness of the devotee of Kali, likewise, is a sign of her grace, a sign that the devotee participates directly in her presence. For the terrible, black goddess's devotee frequents her favorite haunts and cherishes her strange ways, which clearly are not the ways of the world but are mad ways that pass the understanding of the world. Ramprasad petitioned Kali to grant him the boon of her madness and, receiving it, was blessed, for it marked his direct participation in her redemptive asylum, direct participation in her wild, insane presence. Before leaving this point it is well to emphasize that the madness of the saints is not all of one type. There are variations suggested in the series of examples cited, and to a great extent, I think, these variations are to be explained not only in terms of the peculiarities of individual devotees (although this surely has something to do with it) but also in terms of the deities they worship or strive to identify or commune with. That is, the nature of a saint's madness seems to be determined by that presence which possesses him. The madness of the Krsna devotee, for example, is frenzied and distraught like the love-mad gopis. The devotee of Siva or Kali is frenzied, too, but not so much in the sense of being distraught by 89 In Bengal Vaisnavism there is a conscious attempt to express devotion by patterning one's devotional life on the example of the gopls. There is a vast literature on the subject in which the various stages of perfection are minutely delineated in terms of a lover's relationship with her beloved. The various moods and sentiments of Sanskrit poetics are incorporated directly into this devotional system and applied, with some modifications, to the devotional relationship with God (Krsna). The technical term denoting conscious imitation of the gopis (and Radha in the very highest stages) is ragdnugd. There are two central texts of the Bengal Vaisnavas that deal with this aspect of devotion: Rupa Gosvamin's Bhakti-rasdmrta-sindhu and Ujjvala-nilamani. 299</page><page sequence="31">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition love as numbed and stunned by a glimpse of the void. The madness of the gopis is provoked by incomparable beauty. The madness of Ramprasad is provoked by what is seen in the dark of night by the flickering light of burning corpses in the cremation ground. The devotee of Krsna who through his ardent devotion comes close enough to the god to hear his flute is set dancing in mad delight. The devotee of Siva who through devotion or sadhana gets close enough to hear his drum, or the devotee of Kali who gets close enough to glimpse her sword, may also be set dancing, but may also be driven to act like the peys and bhitas who dance with these deities. In other words, the madness of Siva's and Kalis devotees has about it an eerie, contrary aspect that is generally missing in the case of Krsna devotees, and this difference marks the difference between the deities in question. It would seem, therefore, that the different types of saintly madness have partly to do with the nature of the deity who bestows this blessing. Third, the madness of the saint marks him as someone who has renounced or is indifferent to the world. Because he is totally absorbed in an other world (point 1), because he participates directly in the presence of the god he adores (point 2), he no longer participates in the ordinary humdrum world of other men in the ways other men do, if he participates in that world at all. He has renounced the ways of the world to revel in the ways of his God and as such is indifferent to the phenomenal world. To those who do not share or do not understand the nature of that other world in which the saint participates, he appears mad. He does not act like other men, for he is no longer motivated by wordly desires and longings, and so his actions seem aimless, foolish, mad. The kauldcdri is mad because he no longer cares for the world. He quite insanely, in the eyes of the world, makes no distinction between what is sacred and what is profane, what is auspicious and what is inauspicious, valuing equally dung and gold. In his indifference to the world he is not limited by social conventions or customs and behaves unpredictably and "as he pleases." Having renounced the world he seems mad in the eyes of the world. His dress and behavior are unseemly, outrageous, insane. To behave as if mad, furthermore, seems to be efficacious in achieving this sublime, saintly indifference to the world, this renunciation of the phenomenal world as the final stage of man's spiritual destiny. In Pasupata sddhana the adept courts censure and abuse by acting like a madman. In his heroic attempt to renounce the world the Pasupata adept reinforces his physical 300</page><page sequence="32">History of Religions renunciation of the world by publicly behaving insanely and consequently heaping on himself the ridicule of the world. He puts himself in the role of the madman who cannot cope with the world and with whom the world cannot cope and thus isolates himself from the world and its ways. His pretended madness provokes attitudes that drive him to an indifference to, if not a loathing for, the world and that eventually make him truly mad in the eyes of the world. This stage of Paupata sadhana, to under- line the point, is preliminary to the third and fourth stages, which entail his living alone in a cave (third stage) and in a cremation ground (fourth stage). Acting as if insane prepares the adept to completely renounce the world by turning the world against him and engendering in his mind (one would assume) reciprocal feelings of disgust for that world which loathes him. One more example should suffice to make the point that acting as if mad facilitates, reinforces, or complements renunciation of the world and indifference to the world. In the Jdbala Upani.sad (6) the state of the paramaharhsa (supreme swan) is described. This is said to be the highest spiritual stage in this text, achieved through heroic effort in the stage of the sanyasin. Paramahahmsas, the text says, "do not exhibit any visible signs of their order or any visible rules of conduct; though they are really not mad they behave like one mad; they go out for alms only for keeping the body and soul together; they are unaffected by acquisition or absence (of alms), they have no house but wander about and stay in a temple or on a heap of grass, on an ant-hill, or at the foot of a tree or on a river bank or in a cave, they have attachment for nothing, they are centred in contemplation of the One Spirit."90 The madness of the saints, fourth, suggests that they are not at home in the phenomenal world. Their total absorption in God (point 1), their direct participation in the deity they adore or in an other world (point 2), and their renunciation of, and indifference to, the world (point 3) all suggest that the saint is adrift, as it were, in the material, cause-and-effect world, a sojourner whose vision is focused beyond on something normal men do not see. People mocked the Marathi saint, Ramdas, because he seemed to be leading a useless life. Caitanya could barely manage to clothe and feed himself in the latter phases of his intoxicated career as Krsna's beloved. Ramakrishna behaved as unpredictably and spontaneously as a child and repeatedly fell into fits of uncon- 90 Kane (n. 10 above), 2, pt. 2:941. 301</page><page sequence="33">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition sciousness, submerged in Brahman, or danced and wept uncontroll- ably in frenzied fits of devotion to Mother Kali. In the eyes of the scheming, pragmatic, cause-and-effect world such men lead useless lives by behaving in silly, frivolous, childish ways. So their careers and their every action (like the actions of the gods) are called play.91 They are not serious in any wordly sense. They do not seem to understand the fantastic responsibilities of living, thriving, suffering, and dying in this world. They must, indeed, be mad. The saints, in fact, are mad and act insanely in the eyes of the world because, quite clearly, the world no longer holds any attraction for them. Immersed in the intoxicating beauty of Krsna's world, or overwhelmed by the dazzling rhythms of Siva's dance, or smiling from the other shore of enlightenment, the saint dwells in utterly redeeming bliss. Completely distracted, he does not and cannot give the world its due-that somber sobriety that marks the responsible citizen of the pragmatic world. He is prone to smile, laugh, sing, dance, and act in other outrageous and spontaneous ways, oblivious to custom and dharma generally. Like the love-infatuated Radha when she hears the sound of Krsna's flute, the "gates of dharma come crashing down," so distracted is the saint in that ultimate reality that redeems him and in which he finds his final spiritual at-homeness. The saint is not at home in the phenomenal world, furthermore, as he is the one who sees truly, who sees the world for what it really is: a sea of flux, a fleeting speck in infinite time and space. He is no longer bewitched by the world, by that wonderful, dazzling display of the gods' mad play, and so cannot seriously involve himself in maintaining and supporting it. The saint is the one, too, who sees and understands himself truly. He sees his phenomenal existence, his precious biography, as fleeting, con- stantly changing, and insubstantial-a mask or role he plays in an endless comedy (or perhaps tragedy) choreographed by mad and playful divine reflexes, or determined by a whole string of thoughts and actions motivated and calculated from a position of not knowing, that is, the saint's past karma. He sees the ego for 91 It is very common in the Hindu tradition to refer to the biographies, or the actions generally, of the saints as play. Caitanya's most popular biography, for example, is divided into three parts, the Adi-, Madhya-, and Antya-lilas, the early, middle, and late "playings." Mahipati entitles his account of Marathi saints Bhaktilizlmrta, "the eternal play of devotion." And Swami Saradananda's biography of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna the Great Master, is entitled in the original Bengali, Sri Rdmakrsna-lild-prasanga, "about the play of Ramakrishna." 302</page><page sequence="34">History of Religions what it really is, a fragile, intoxicated, "drunken monkey" that in its worldly seriousness is hopelessly in love with itself. Seeing the world and himself in ultimate perspective, the saint is obviously no longer at home in the phenomenal world and in the eyes of ignorant men behaves as if mad. Or perhaps the saint is really mad, driven so by the surprising, stunning truth of his ultimate vision. The mooring that grounds the normal man to the world and enables him to take the world with appropriate seriousness has been cut in the case of the saint, for he no longer cares about physical well-being and physical immortality; he no longer cares about conforming his life to worldly norms and orienting himself to worldly goals. He has been set adrift from the world and can no longer reestablish a nostalgia for worldly things. He is no longer at home with the rest of men and so seems mad. Fifth, and finally, the madness of the saints is a mark of their freedom and transcendence. This should be obvious from what has already been said. Madness as illustrative of saintliness, as in the case of the gods, indicates that the saint is free not to behave in accordance with accepted patterns of behavior. Normal behavior to him who has seen truly or who participates in a transcendent, other world is only one possibility. The kauldcari is quite free to behave normally, according to wordly expectations, but he need not. He may, and typically does, behave strangely, perhaps perversely, for he understands the ultimate sameness of things and in this knowledge has transcended worldly habit and prejudice. He has been freed to act as if mad; indeed, he has been freed to become mad. The saint is freed to behave foolishly, to be completely and naively open to the transcendental. He is freed to be madly in love, to be obsessed by his God, and in this madness he transcends the humdrum and ordinary world to participate in an extraordinary one. In his madness he becomes divine, godlike, acting unpredictably, spontaneously, and surprisingly-entangled and absorbed in his overwhelming vision he is aloof, indifferent, and irresponsible to the world and its pragmatic rhythms, a useless, insane, intoxicated being who has been set adrift from things, never to return. It should be clear from our interpretive commentary on the madness of the saints that this peculiar pattern of behavior, as in the case of the madness of the gods, fits the Hindu view of man's spiritual destiny, that the madness of the saints underlines and articulates certain central themes in the Hindu tradition's definition of man's ultimate religious quest. Without unnecessarily 303</page><page sequence="35">Divine Madness in the Hindu Tradition belaboring the argument and lengthening the essay, I should like to point out how the madness of the saints suggests the truths implied in the ideas of moksa, kaivalya, the jwvan-mukta, and descriptions of salvation in several of the bhakti traditions. While these terms and descriptions do not present direct parallels to the theme of divine madness, they provide the context within which madness is understood to be redemptive. Moksa (release) and mukti (liberation), as the most frequent terms used to describe man's spiritual destiny in Hinduism, underline the fact that man's destiny is to transcend the phenomenal world, to be released from karma and samsdra, the eternal wheel of rebirth, and to revel in absolute freedom. Kaivalya (isolation), a term used particularly in the sdrhkhya-yoga system, also makes this point. Man's spiritual goal is achieved when he has succeeded in isolating himself from the world, from the binding, blinding meshes of prakrti. The jivan-mukta (the one liberated while living), an important model of the fully enlightened man in the Hindu tradition, also insists upon the truth that the liberated man has freed himself from the phenomenal world. The jivan-mukta wanders the world completely unattached to it. His spirit has completely transcended the world, and his physical body simply burns up the few remaining impulses of past karma. He does not act, but is simply acted upon by his past karma. He has emptied himself, as it were, of his grasping ego and wanders aloof, sublimely transcendent. Such seems to be one of the main thrusts also of divine madness. The saints are mad, we have suggested, primarily because they no longer are attached to the world but are absorbed in an other world. They can no longer cope with the world because the world has lost its appeal, and to the eyes of the unenlightened such men seem mad, or indeed are mad. In the bhakti traditions salvation is usually said to consist of union or communion with a particular deity or divine presence. This communion is described as being transcendentally delightful, intoxicating, blissful, and overwhelming. It causes stupor, weeping, laughing, intoxication, and impulsive dancing. It causes those who experience it most fully to act as if mad, or in fact to become mad, by boggling and stunning their minds. Communion with the divine in the Hindu tradition is rarely described as comfortable, static, or predictable. When man enters into a relationship with the divine, or when the divine descends upon man, a topsy-turvy, tumultuous, rambunctious affair gets underway, and this affair is appropriately described as mad. 304</page><page sequence="36">History of Religions In conclusion, it is well to remember that madness, although it is often a medically objectifiable disease, is in almost every culture to some extent a socially defined phenomenon. Madness is seen as something that deviates from the norm, a type of behavior that is outrageous and contrary to clearly defined patterns of thought and behavior. Madness in the Hindu context is no exception. Madness appears when behavioral patterns that deviate too drastically from established social norms manifest themselves. In the context of the Hindu tradition's understanding of divinity and man's spiritual goal, then, madness appears to be almost an essential mark of the gods and the redeemed man, for if one thing is clear in the Hindu tradition it is the contingent, finite nature of samsdra and man's own modifications of sarmsara, that is, the social, moral, economic order. The gods are gods because they transcend sahmsdra, and the saints are saints because they, too, have transcended the phenomenal world. The Hindu vision of the divine, emphasizing the truth that the gods cannot be circum- scribed, explodes man's limited view of his world. If the gods behaved normally, predictably, and rationally, if they partook too fully of human ways, they would be little more than supermen. In their madness, however, they transcend an anthropomorphic understanding of divinity and hint at dimensions that can only be apprehended in awe. The saint, too, is mad, for he is open to a dimension of reality that completely transcends the phenomenal. He sees things in true perspective. He understands the limited, fragile nature of the world and can no longer take it completely seriously. The saint deviates from the norm, realizing that the norm itself is mad, grounded in ignorance, in a limited, bound view of reality as oriented toward man's ego satisfaction. The saints, and the gods too, may appear mad to him who is still bound to this view of the world. The saint, though, in his madness has achieved final freedom and fulfillment of his spiritual destiny, a freedom that transcends the bound human condition, a freedom that transcends the bondage to normality. He has passed through the looking glass, as it were, and revels in the wonderland of redemp- tive insanity. McMaster University 305</page></plain_text>
