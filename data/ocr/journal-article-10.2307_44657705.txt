Trevino NASA/Johnson Space Center ABSTRACT With new direction to return to the Moon, NASA is developing highly efficient and lightweight extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment for working on the rugged lunar terrain. This paper presents results and evaluations of lunar thermal environments and design challenges for the EVA system. The evaluations include a review of basic lunar environment data, a review of metabolic rate predictions, analyses and reviews of spacesuit heat leak effects in past designs, and methods to improve the performance of spacesuit-mounted radiators in a hot lunar environment. In addition to reviewing existing lunar thermal environment data, a simplified thermal model is presented that can simulate the lunar surface temperature variation as a function of latitude and time on the lunar surface. The assumed physical and optical properties of the lunar soil as well as the solar heating on the Earth's Moon are also presented. INTRODUCTION For past manned missions, the EVA thermal environment has been a major design driver for the EVA spacesuit, starting with the thermal protection requirements of the anthropomorphic spacesuit garment and extending to the primary life support system (PLSS) on the spacesuit. The thermal environment Influences passive system design, such as material selections and infrared/solar coating selections, as well as active system design, such as sublimators, radiators, liquid cooling systems, and crewmember metabolic expenditure for performing critical EVA tasks. Along with the thermal environment, metabolic heat load and metabolic rate predictions also affect equipment designs and consumables. Determining accurate metabolic heat loads is a challenge since it is closely tied to the outside thermal environment. An understanding of the impact of metabolic heat load first requires a review of historic space program metabolic expenditures. Also affected by the thermal environment is spacesuit heat leak, which in tum affects insulation requirements and thermal consumables of the spacesuit. A review of past mission heat leak effects as a function of the environment heat load is important to quantify expected heat leak on upcoming lunar EVAs. Thermal environments can also affect and degrade spacesuit radiator performance in the presence of both infrared and solar heat fluxes. In evaluating methods to improve spacesuit radiator performance on the lunar surface, the steady-state heat rejection performance is presented for multiple spacesuit-mounted radiator concepts at various solar angles and operating temperatures. The radiator concepts use shades to provide varying degrees of protection from the hot lunar dayside surface. The evaluation determines the affect of each shading method on daytime steady-state heat rejection rates for each proposed concept. A baseline radiator evaluation is also provided for comparison. In addition, a radiator directional sink temperature study and an environmental cube analysis are described to help verify results and provide directional information of the radiation heat transfer in the lunar thermal environment. This information has provided insight into improving the efficacy of future lunar surface radiator designs. In summary, this paper attempts to provide accurate predictions of how the lunar surface environment will affect astronaut metabolic rates, spacesuit heat leak, and spacesuit-mounted radiator performance. A simplified thermal math model of the lunar surface is presented and used to establish boundary conditions in simulating the steady-state heat rejection capability of several conceptual radiator designs. The performance 492</page><page sequence="2">findings reveal lunar surface IR and solar trapping to be major contributors in total heat absorption. BASIC LUNAR ENVIRONMENT REVIEW OF EXISTING DATA The lunar surface undergoes an extreme variation of temperatures ranging from -299 °F to 250 °F (See Figure 1). Further, the predicted maximum diurnal lunar surface temperature as a function of latitude (from 0 to 70 deg) is shown to decrease from about 250 °F down to 88 °F [1]. Lunar surfaces with lower maximum temperatures would exist above 70 deg latitude. Further analysis is warranted to find maximum and minimal temperature extremes on various latitudes above 70 deg on the Moon. It should be borne in mind that at higher latitudes, it is possible that certain surfaces never get to see the sun, such as the bottoms of craters. A thermal model is presented that predicts the diurnal lunar surface temperatures as a function of latitude [1]. The physical and optical properties of the lunar surface have some variation depending on the location of the Moon. According to an analysis of the Clementine spacecraft infrared camera data, lunar surface solar absorptivity can vary from 0.85 to 0.93 [2], Historical measurements of regolith spectral emittance indicate emissivity can vary between 0.92 (at 440 K) and 0.98 (at 80 K) [3]. This model takes into consideration the following physical and optical properties: Solar Constant = 1413.3 W/m2 Lunar soil solar absorptance a = 0.93 Lunar soil infrared emittance e = 0.92 Lunar soil thermal Conductivity k = 0.00201 W/(m-K) Lunar soil density p = 2000.7 kg/m3 Lunar soil specific heat capacity Cp = 251.2 J/(kg-K) - 829.0 J/(kg-K) Figure 1. Predicted Diurnal Lunar Surface Temperatures as a Function of Latitude 1 The Apollo program established the fact that lunar infrared radiation is very strong and did cause problems for both orbiting and surface missions. On Apollo Missions 15 and 17, low-lying mountains close to the landing sites had a profound effect on the thermal performance of lunar equipment. Even though the zenith-pointing radiator of the electronic packages had a very small view factor of the surrounding mountains, it was enough to raise its temperature by 18 °F. Thus in the presence of such high planetary infrared emission, the deployment of radiators on the lunar surface should be such that the view factor between the lunar surface and the radiator is minimized. On this account, radiators with ground shades are preferred. For a range of solar and infrared radiation values, see Table 1, taken from [4]. Table 1.

Minimum Lunar dust is also problematic when covering radiator surfaces. This is because lunar dust has a high solar absorptivity of about 0.93; even a small amount of dust on the radiator surface, which typically has a low absorptivity, can cause severe degradation in radiator performance. On the lunar rover mission during Apollo 1 7, dust had to be brushed off of the rover at every stop. The effect of dust cannot be overlooked in the design and construction of radiator surfaces, especially those for a lunar habitat, where the surfaces would likely be large and difficult to brush down regularly. It is determined that the lunar topsoil or regolith has a very low thermal diffusivity. As a result, shadowed areas can expect temperature drops down to -280 °F during the day. This may be a concern for radiators with large shades causing overwhelming cold spots. SIMPLIFIED THERMAL MODEL A simple thermal math model is used to simulate the lunar surface temperature variation as a function of latitude and time on the lunar surface [5], This model cannot be used for high latitudes (i.e., close to the poles). This is because the simplified thermal model assumes that there is no internal heat generation one meter below the lunar surface and that no solar flux reaches the lunar poles. The figures in the report show the predicted maximum surface temperatures with variation of lunar latitudes. Two graphs are generated, one using the worst-case high solar radiation value at the Earth's Perihelion and the other using the worst-case low solar radiation value at the Earth's Aphelion. Assumptions The model assumes that adiabatic conditions exist one meter below the lunar surface. It also assumes that the lunar regolith is homogenous and its specific heat and thermal conductivity do not vary with depth. In addition, the model considers the following parameters: 493</page><page sequence="3">Solar Constant = 1421 W/m2 (worst-case high), 1316 W/m2 (worst-case low) Lunar soil solar absorptance a = 0.93 Lunar soil Infrared emittance e = 0.92 Lunar soil thermal conductivity k = 0.00201 W/(m-K) Lunar soil density p = 2000.7 kg/m3 Lunar soil specific heat capacity Cp = 829.0 J/(kg-K) A caveat of this model is that it assumes the lunar surface is flat, non-shaded, and non-cratered. The model also does not take into consideration any reflected solar or infrared radiation from nearby mountains or habitats. Model Setup and Results A one-dimensional transient heat conduction equation is used to simulate the heat transfer within a meter of lunar regolith. In this model, a varying solar flux is applied to the lunar surface using the standard function: MAX[0, (a qSOi cos(&lt;ļ&gt;) sin(co t))] where qSOi = solar constant (W/m2) (1) = angle of latitude (rad) co = lunar periodic time (s) t = time (s) The Max function returns only the positive part of the applied solar heat flux (Note: the solar flux approaches 0 as the latitude reaches 90N or 90S). The lunar soil is assumed to be adiabatic one meter below the lunar surface, as documented in the Apollo 15 mission report, where the temperature was found to be a constant -10 °F [6]. As a result, the model is invalid for Polar Regions, where the Moon's internal heat generation cannot be ignored. The internal regolith nodes shown in Figure 2 are governed by the equation: ^ ÕT , Õ2T " dt ~ Ôx2 ' This second order partial differential equation needs two boundary conditions in order to be solved. The first boundary condition is represented by the heat transfer through the top node in Figure 2, considered to be the lunar surface boundary node, and is governed by the following equation: &lt;1 boundary = A ' MAX[0, (a q sol cos(&lt;1&gt;) sin(© /))] + ^(rs;ce-r4) while the second boundary condition is represented by the bottom node (one meter into the ground) which is adiabatic as follows: ^ = 0. õx This problem is solved in this study using the finite differencing method with the nodalization shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Simplified Lunar Regolith Model for Low to Moderate Latitudes Simulations of daytime and nighttime lunar surface temperature variation at several latitudes are conducted and the results can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3 depicts a worst-case high solar flux scenario of 1421 W/m2, occurring when the Earth is at its perihelion. Due to the proximity of the Moon, it experiences the same solar flux intensities as Earth. The results in Figure 4 are for a worst-case low solar flux scenario. This occurs when the Earth is at its aphelion, resulting in a solar flux of 1 3 1 6 W/m2. Summary Due to the lack of an atmosphere and the properties of the regolith, the Moon undergoes extreme temperatures and rapid temperature changes. The temperature of a flat equatorial surface has been shown to vary from -299 to 250 °F. However, temperatures of around -387 °F could also be found in deep craters located at the poles, where virtually no solar radiation is present. The thermal model has also indicated a swift increase and decrease in temperature during sunrise and sunset, respectively. During the first 24 hrs of daylight, the surface temperature at the equator of the Moon increases by about 309 °F. From 12 hrs before sunset to 12 hrs after, surface temperature drops approximately 205 °F. The planetary infrared radiation on the Moon is the greatest inhibitor of radiator heat rejection. Since radiators operating in vacuum environments reject heat by infrared emission, the removal of hotter background sources from view will help lower the effective sink temperature of the radiator. Thus, for better radiator efficiency, the use of ground-blocking shields would 494</page><page sequence="4">prove beneficial. Vacuum environment radiators rely heavily on low absorptivity (-0.18) and high emissivity (-0.84) in order to operate effectively. Unfortunately, the settling of lunar dust on radiator surfaces can attract heat, because dust has a high absorptivity value (-0.93), resulting in degraded radiator performance. Figure 3. Predicted Lunar Surface Temperatures during Worst-case High Solar Radiation (Perihelion) Figure 4. Predicted Lunar Surface Temperatures during Worst-case Low Solar Radiation (Aphelion) METABOLIC RATE PREDICTIONS Metabolic rates affect equipment designs and consumables, which include extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) cooling and ventilation equipment, such as water tanks and water quantity, C02 removal system sizing, and thermal equipment sizing. For future missions, equipment designs can be optimized and consumables conserved with proper metabolic rate predictions. This section summarizes historic metabolic expenditures for Apollo, Skylab, and Shuttle missions, discusses rationale for developing new lunar metabolic rate requirements, and proposes new metabolic rate requirements for future microgravity and lunar missions. Emphasis is placed on the Apollo metabolic rates as it applies to upcoming Constellation Program missions that will take place on the moon. Data from microgravity missions is shown for reference on relative activity levels. REVIEW OF EXISTING DATA Apollo Metabolic History The Apollo EVA metabolic expenditures represent a variety of activities ranging from work site set up within a gravity environment to roving vehicle operations. Table 2 shows metabolic rate extremes and averages for the entire Apollo program [7]. Table 2.

All activities 272 While the average metabolic rate for all activities was 272 W, it is interesting to note that 84% of all lunar EVAs occurred at an average metabolic rate of 296 W, while roving activities, accounting for the other 16%, averaged 143 W. Table 3 presents a summary of the metabolic activities and expenditures for the Apollo 15 EVA Commander to illustrate the metabolic heat load difference between high and low activity levels [8]. Skylab Metabolic History The Skylab EVAs consisted of deploying solar panels, a solar canopy, and various vehicle and experiment repairs. The highest instantaneous metabolic rate observed was 580 W, and was reached while the crew member was cutting a deployment strap for the solar panels. The lowest metabolic rate levels (168 W on avg.) occurred during little or no activity periods during night passes. The average metabolic rate for all missions was 267 Watts. 495</page><page sequence="5">Table 3.

The historical explanation for establishing a higher specification is that microgravity EVAs were treated just like Apollo EVAs during the design of the Shuttle EMU, since the majority of NASA's experience with spacesuits was obtained during Apollo. EVAs on the Moon required high metabolic rates associated with walking in a gravity environment, and since microgravity EVAs were not well defined initially, Shuttle EVA equipment was designed to the Apollo standards. In a previous study, data is collected for Shuttle EVAs on flights STS-6 through STS-82, covering 77 man-EVAs (75 hours of data) and 464 EVA-hours (440 hours of data) [7]. Here, a summary of the crew member activities for each mission was presented along with associated metabolic rates. The purpose of that study was to describe the collection of EVA metabolic rates and profiles to use as requirements for EVA hardware development for Space Station and beyond. Actual mission metabolic average rates and instantaneous (discrete) rates were derived from oxygen consumption. Mission metabolic rate averages from post-flight analyses of lithium hydroxide C02 canisters were also obtained for comparison purposes only. Based on the Shuttle experience and the above analysis, an average metabolic rate of 250 W is recommended for the design of future microgravity EMU equipment. This value allows for up to 8 hours of EVA with existing Shuttle EMU consumables. A metabolic profile for advanced EVA equipment is required that also contains a maximum metabolic rate for peak hardware design purposes. For peak hardware design purposes, a value of 600 W, similar to the Shuttle EMU peak, is recommended. A typical metabolic rate profile containing these characteristics has been developed, and is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5. Metabolic Load Profile Requirement for Microgravity EVAs RECOMMENDED LUNAR SURFACE METABOLIC PROFILE Given the historical Apollo metabolic rate data and post- Apollo metabolic rate data, the following profile is suggested for Constellation Program moon missions. Figure 6 shows a metabolic rate profile that an EVA crewmember and his/her life support system must accommodate as a minimum in a 4-hour EVA, with recharge being available at the end of 4 hours to continue an EVA to a maximum of 8 hours. This profile will allow an average metabolic rate of 300 watts, with an instantaneous peak of 600 watts and a low sustained rate of 100 Watts. The profile in Figure 6 is only to be used for preliminary analyses and sizing purposes, with final metabolic rate requirements to be determined from further evaluations, such as the lunar walk-back tests currently being conducted at NASA/JSC. 496</page><page sequence="6">Figure 6. Recommended Lunar Metabolic Rate Profile SPACESUIT HEAT LEAK The amount of heat leak in a spacesuit is an important parameter when designing insulation and thermal control systems. A description of spacesuit heat leak can be seen by applying a heat balance on the heat loads in Figure 7. Figure 7. Spacesuit Heat Balance In Figure 7, Qsuit-ieak ¡s the net heat lost through the suit insulation, Qtcs is the heat removed by the thermal control system, Qgen is the internal heat generated by the crewmember and the equipment within the spacesuit, Qabs refers to absorbed solar and IR thermal radiation on the surface of the spacesuit, Qemitted is the thermal radiation emitted from the spacesuit exterior, and Qconv, is heat convection from an external gas environment, such as on Mars. In both Figures 7A and 7B, a heat balance is applied using the entire suit as a control volume. It is important to note that the passive environmental terms in Figure 7 are thermodynamically equivalent to Qsuit-ieak. since the suit heat leak is defined as the net heat lost passively through the insulation due to the environment. The Qsuit-ieak term is usually a non-zero value. The adopted convention is that heat leak is positive when the net heat is lost from the spacesuit. Early Apollo data assumed an opposite sign convention. From Figures 7A and 7B, spacesuit heat leak can be expressed two different ways: Qsuit-ieak = Qgen- Qtcs&gt; (from Fig. 7A) and after substitution using both heat balances, Qsuit-ieak = Qemitted Qconv - Qabs REVIEW OF HEAT LEAK EFFECTS FOR SHUTTLE EMU A solution of the Qsuit-ieak term requires knowledge of suit temperatures and environmental heat loads. Such data can be obtained from past experience in vacuum environments (non-Mars). For Space Shuttle hot, neutral, and cold cases, the net heat leak has been estimated at -570 Btu/hr (167 W) (heat into the suit), 28 Btu/hr (8 W), and 290 Btu/hr (85 W), respectively, although off-nominal cold cases have shown heat leak to approach 500 Btu/hr (147 W) [9]. The Qsuit-ieak term is also equal to the heat flow through the insulation and can be solved with a heat balance through the insulation of the spacesuit. Doing so requires knowing the overall conductance term, Qcond (0.62 W/m2-K in a cold environment for a 5-layer multi-layer insulation), AT, the temperature difference across the insulation, and Asuit, the surface area of the spacesuit. Qsuit-ieak can then be solved with: Qsuit-ieak = Qcond * ASuit * AT In a hot environment, the overall conductance in vacuum is approximately twice that of the cold environment because of the radiative and linear conductance term dependences on temperature within the spacesuit insulation. LUNAR SPACESUIT HEAT FLUX ANALYSIS The heat fluxes for a lunar spacesuit are similar to those shown in the heat balance in Figure 7, except that the Qcond term is not present due to the absence of a significant gas atmosphere on the Moon. For Apollo missions, 7-layered MLI was designed into the spacesuit fabric due to uncertainties in the lunar thermal environment, high heat fluxes present inside lunar craters, and the possibility of conducting EVAs close to lunar noon. The data in Table 4, taken from Apollo spacesuit calorimetry test data [10] and recent thermal analyses, shows spacesuit sink temperature and 497</page><page sequence="7">radiator surface sink temperature predictions for various lunar locations. All predictions, except the lunar polar plains data, are based on a lunar equatorial location. The lunar crater data was obtained from Apollo spacesuit heat leak test data and thermal environment data (heat absorbed) [10]. The data provides early predictions of spacesuit materials and thermal control system requirements, and show that the cold environments (lunar polar plains) pose the greatest thermal protection challenges. The lunar crater data also indicates that extra cooling and possibly extra insulation will be required. Table 4.

The radiators are evaluated at operating temperatures of 70 °F and 130 °F for a flow-through radiator and a heat pump radiator, and respectfully at 0, 30, 60, &amp; 90 degrees solar incidence to represent daytime heating. A directional sink temperature study and an environmental cube analysis are performed to supplement and validate the results. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE The basic process for evaluating each configuration can be broken down Into 5 primary steps: 1. Geometry creation, nodalization, active side assignment, and optical property assignment (TSS) 2. Establish radiation conductance using Monte Carlo ray tracing technique (TSS) 3. Create and apply incident solar heating rates (TSS) 4. Apply boundary conditions 5. Determine steady-state temperatures and heat rejection rates of radiating surfaces (SINDA) LUNAR SURFACE MODELING Although a vast majority of the Moon's surface is filled with craters, mountains, and rocky plains, the entire study assumes a flat surface. It also assumes that the ground is infinitely long in all directions, given the size of man relative to the lunar surface. Unfortunately, TSS cannot create infinitely large surfaces. Therefore, the vast lunar surface is approximated with a smaller finite surface. The dimensions of this finite surface are determined using an average radiator height and the following view factor equation [1 1]: i f m y i vi F d 1-2= TT- tan~' W V - I . . tan~' / , . &gt; 2^ W V VX2+72 I . . {tJX2+Y2)) / , . d c where X = - and Y = - b b f- c - Figure 8. View Factor Equation For an infinite ground plane, the view factor to the ground is exactly 0.5 for any object on that plane. The equation above only computes view factors from A1 to A2 for one side of A1's total view. Therefore, the equation reduces to a value of 0.25 when A2 is infinitely long in each direction. It is assumed that a surface yielding 98% of this view factor or 0.245, will suffice. Assuming a and b are equal ( X = 1), the equation is solved for Y. Given an average radiator height of about 58 inches (1 .47 meters), both a and b are calculated to be 83 meters. Thus, doubling a and b to account for both left and right sides, yields a 166 x 166 m plane, on which the object is centered. The greatest uncertainties in the analysis are the lunar surface optical properties. This is because measurement data is limited to only a few experiments performed on Apollo and lunar flyby missions. In this paper, the lunar ground surface is assumed to have a solar absorptivity of 0.93 and an infrared emissivity of 0.98 [12]. This worst-case scenario occurs at mid- latitudes, where the lunar albedo has been measured as low as 0.07 [2]. 498</page><page sequence="8">Since the area of the ground plane is still far greater than the surfaces analyzed In this study, It is necessary to increase ground plane nodal resolution in the vicinity of the radiator surfaces. This effectively increases ray interaction between the radiator surfaces and the ground plane. In order to keep the node count as low as possible, a multi-block grid is applied to the lunar surface (See Figure 9). The highly nodalized central square in Figure 9 is 46 x 46 m, and contains 2500 nodes, for a resolution of about 1 node per square meter. The eight surrounding blocks, which fill the rest of the ground plane, consist of 1 node each. The ground plane is modeled as an insulated surface using zero-capacitance nodes, and is considered an acceptable assumption for dayside surface temperature predictions [6]. Since the lunar soil has a very low thermal conductivity, -0.00006 W/(cm-K) at the surface and -0.0002 W/(cm-K) at a depth of 1 meter, the lateral conductivity within the surface is neglected [6]. Figure 9. Ground Plane Mesh An average solar flux of 1371 W/m2 is used throughout this study for all solar incident angles. The solar flux is applied in every case as if the object existed at 0 deg latitude (equator) of the Moon. Ignoring craters, worst- case lunar surface temperatures can be found along the equator, where temperatures can reach up to 386 + 8 K (235 + 14 °F) at lunar noon [2], At sunrise, the initial ground temperature of the Moon's equatorial surface, due to subsurface heat retention and a low radioactive heating at the core, is estimated between 80 K (-316 °F) and 100 K (-280 °F) [4,12]. Thus, an average initial surface temperature of 90 K (-298 °F) is assumed. To account for this initial surface temperature, the following heat rate model is applied to every ground node: Q lunarsurface Q env Q'X) where Qiunarsurface = total applied heat rate Qenv = environmental heat rate Qgo = constant heat rate to ensure 90 K The value of Qgo is dependent on the size of each node's surface area and is calculated using the following equation: Q,o =iAa(Tobj4-Tsink") where £ = 0.98 A = node area (m2) a = 5.67x1 0"8 W/(m2-K4) Tobj = 90 K Tsink = 3 K Overall, the model is slightly conservative, since the applied 90 K equivalent heat load is always added to the environmental heating. Relatively speaking, the 90 K heating is quite small; less than 0.3% of the average solar heat flux of 1371 W/m2. SINK TEMPERATURE STUDY The ability of a radiator to reject heat is highly dependent upon the sink temperature of its radiating surfaces. On the surface of the Moon, the sink temperature of an object primarily becomes a function of its view factor to space, the hot lunar surface, and the sun. As a result, steady-state sink temperatures are examined between lunar sunrise and lunar noon for seven surfaces facing different directions on a flat lunar ground plane. The orientation, size, and labeling of each pseudo-radiator surface can be seen as part of a symmetric seven-sided shell in Figure 10. The active sides in the model are the exterior surfaces of the shell and the lunar ground plane. Each shell surface is 1 m2 4 3 E &lt; '3W East SEZNÁŠ" West 1E 1W &lt;• A A &gt; Ground plane Figure 10. Cross-Section of Seven-Sided Shell on Flat Lunar Surface Each pseudo-radiator surface is modeled as a zero- capacitance node with an absorptivity and emissivity value of 0.18 and 0.84, respectively. Using TSS generated environmental heating rates and radiation conductors, the environmental sink temperatures are easily calculated with SINDA. The relative orientation between the shell and the solar direction can be seen in Figure 1 1 . Sink temperatures are determined at incident angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°. 499</page><page sequence="9">Surfaces 1-3 in Figure 10 have an eastward and westward component so that sink temperatures at solar angles between 90 and 180 deg are calculated simultaneously, eliminating the need for separate heat rate files. The resulting daytime temperature profile for each surface can be found in Figure 12. For the top pseudo-radiator surface, 4, we see a rapid increase and decrease in temperature, with a maximum temperature at lunar noon of -5 °C. The vertically oriented surface, 1, ramps up from 5 °C at dawn to a maximum temperature of 66 °C at 60 deg solar incidence. The 45 deg surface, 2, starts at -28 °C and reaches a maximum temperature of 26 °C also at 60 deg incidence. The 30 deg surface, 3, begins at -48 °C and reaches a maximum temperature of 12 °C at same solar incidence. The ground follows a similar pattern as the top surface, but experiences much higher temperatures and maxes out at 116 °C. The dashed line represents a possible EVA radiator operating temperature of 21 °C. Figure 11. Orientation of Applied Solar Flux on Shell The overall shapes of the curves match up quite well with the preliminary analysis conducted at NASA/JSC.14 The only notable and acceptable differences are increases and decreases in temperature due to the inclusion of albedo in this model. For example, the vertical surface in this model, surface 1, peaks in temperature when the sun is at 60 deg rather than at 90 deg (noon). This is justified by the fact that such a solar angle results in a significant amount of solar trapping and lunar surface IR. Furthermore, the maximum ground temperature in this model is approximately 2 °C lower than in the preliminary model, which is likely because this model uses a slightly higher lunar surface emissivity value. Figure 12. Shell Sink Temperatures ENVIRONMENTAL CUBE ANALYSIS The intent of the environmental cube (or flux cube) analysis is to determine the total incident solar and IR heat flux experienced by objects on the lunar surface, particularly a spacesuit radiator. The results from this analysis will allow for quick and simple calculations of radiator performance and the performance of various other objects designed for the lunar surface environment. The flux cube analysis is performed on a 1 cm3 cube, positioned at a height of 43 in. or 1.1 m above the lunar surface (approximate height to bottom of PLSS) (See Figure 13). Solar heating is applied at incident angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° with the cube oriented as shown in Figure 14. A small cube is used so as not to significantly interfere with the surrounding environment. Figure 13. Environmental Cube on Flat Plane 500</page><page sequence="10">Figure 14. Orientation of Flux Cube Relative to Solar Incidence The break up of total incident heat flux for a given face of the cube into its solar and IR components is done using the following relation: qIR=&lt;rT4--%ta- A £ A where C|ir = incident IR flux on the face (W/m2) G = 5.67x1 0"8 W/(m2-K4) T = sink temperature of the face (K) a = 1.0 £=1.0 Q Solar = incident solar heat rate on the face (W) A = area of the face (0.0001 m2) The incident IR flux is found by substituting in the SINDA determined temperature and TSS computed incident solar heat rate, and solving. The incident solar flux, qsoiar, is simply the quotient of the TSS computed incident solar heat rate over the area of the face. The calculations are performed on each of the six faces of the cube in order to account for each major direction within the environment. The incident IR and solar flux values for each cube face at the chosen solar angles can be found in Table 5. Here we see that the incident solar flux only affects the front and top faces between 0° and 90° solar incidence. The front face starts out with 1371 Watts/m2 at 0° incidence and tapers off to 0 Watts/m2 at 90° solar incidence, while the top face heat flux follows the reverse trend. All other surfaces experience zero incident solar heating between 0° and 90° solar incidence. Table 5 also shows incident IR flux increasing for all surfaces except for the top face. At 0° solar, a small amount of incident IR flux is present on the front, rear, side, and bottom faces. Table 5.

At 0° solar incidence, the total solar flux is applied to the front face, while zero flux is shown for the other faces. In particular, the bottom and side faces should receive some incident solar heat reflected off the diffuse lunar surface. This heat is not shown because the flux cube is quite small relative to the ground plane nodal surface area, thereby greatly decreasing the chance of a ground-to-cube solar heating ray. Furthermore the amount of reflected solar energy is rather small, about 7%. In terms of incident IR flux, the trends also appear correct. IR fluxes should increase as the solar incident angle increases, because lunar surface IR radiation is a direct function of the soil temperature and because soil temperature increases with increasing solar angle. Furthermore, the quantity of incident IR flux should be similar for the outward pointing surfaces and significantly more for the bottom face, which directly faces the IR radiation from the ground. Zero incident IR flux for the top face is also expected for obvious reasons. STEADY-STATE THERMAL ANALYSES OF PROPOSED CONCEPTS Initial concepts Three geometrically different radiators are initially examined in this study [14]. The first concept is the louvered radiator, shown in Figure 15. The louvered radiator consists of five 46 x 6 inch (117 x 76 cm) louvers attached to a 46 x 30 inch (117x15 cm) vertical base. The radiator is evaluated with the louvers positioned between 0° to 135°, in increments of 45°. The primary radiating surfaces in this concept are the top-sides of each louver. This allows for fully changing the view of each radiating surface. The bottom-sides of the louvers are insulated. Each louver angle is analyzed twice, once with an insulated vertical base, and again with a radiating vertical base. At 0° louver angle, the model is only analyzed with an insulated vertical base since the base is covered completely by the louvers. The side of the vertical base facing the spacesuit is an inactive surface. 501</page><page sequence="11">Figure 15. Louvered Radiator The second concept, called the 'Baby Buggy', can be seen in Figure 16. This design consists of a baseline radiator (rectangular box) covered by a retractable hood, shaped like a classic baby carriage hood. Although shifting the view of the radiating surfaces is not possible, the advantage to this design is the ability to reduce the view factor to the hot lunar ground. The baseline radiator is a 5-sided, parallelepiped radiator with a height of 27.3 inches (69.1 cm), a width of 24 inches (61 cm), and a thickness of 7 inches (17.8 cm), yielding a total surface area of 9.51 sq. ft. (0.884 sq m). The retractable hood consists of six 30° isosceles sectors and is evaluated once as an insulated structure and again as an un-insulated structure. The triangular sides have an inner edge length of 42.9 cm and allow for 2.5 cm clearance around the corners of the radiator. The width of the hood is 66 cm, also providing 2.5 cm clearance on the sides of the radiator. The baby buggy radiator is analyzed at shade angles from 0° to 180°, in increments of 30°. The third radiator configuration, considered to be the baseline radiator, is defined in the previous section. An existing low fidelity TSS submodel of the EMU Is used to represent the suit for each concept. The EMU submodel has very little radiant exchange with the radiator concepts, which is assumed sufficient for this study. Figure 16. Baby Buggy Radiator Assumptions and model configuration In order to obtain the stand-alone performance of each radiator concept, all EMU heat loads are ignored. A future study will integrate steady and transient heat transfer from EMU components and the astronaut. This analysis is geared towards modeling the radiator's maximum heat rejection capability for various hot lunar surface environments. All radiator and EMU surfaces are modeled as zero- capacitance nodes with solar absorptivity and infrared emissivity values of 0.18 and 0.84, respectively. To calculate radiator heat rejection, each radiator surface is connected to a 70 °F (21 °C) or 130 °F (54 °C) SINDA heater node via a large linear conductor with a conductance equal to 200 Btu/(hr-°F). The 21 °C node represents a flow-through radiator surface, whereas the 54 °C node represents a heat pump radiator surface. Given this conductance value, the zero-capacitance node is forced to become virtually the same temperature (within 0.06 °C) as the heater node. The SINDA subroutine HNQCAL is used to calculate the heat rate required to maintain the heater node at its set temperature. For all radiator configurations, the computed total heat rejection rates are averaged between the front, side (left and right), and back-facing astronaut orientations for each solar incident angle (See Figure 17 - Figure 19). This 4-sided average is done to account for all directions and to conveniently summarize the data. The calculated average assumes the astronaut is facing each direction for the same amount of time. The steady-state surface temperatures and heater node energy requirements are a function of the nodal 502</page><page sequence="12">environmental heat rates calculated by the TSS model, the 90 K equivalent lunar surface heat rate, and a 3 K heat sink for deep space. The solar energy, modeled as an infinite, parallel heat source, is angled at 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees relative to the ground. The symmetry of the solar incidence and object geometry allows us to ignore: 120°, 150°, and 180°. Figure 19. Back-facing EMU/Radiator Results Upon completion of the SINDA analyses, the applied heater node energies are summed for each case in order to obtain the total amount of heat radiated by each radiator configuration. These performance totals are averaged between front, side, and back-facing astronaut positions and tabulated for each solar incidence and radiator configuration in Table 6. In Table 6, it is clear that all radiator concepts reject less heat as the solar incident angle increases. Furthermore, it is no surprise that all concepts reject more heat when operating at 54 °C. The resulting averages for the baseline radiator are intermediate compared to the other concepts. For both louvered and baby buggy radiator concepts, no configuration performs best at all solar incident angles. However in the hotter environment (60 - 90 deg solar incidence), it is seen that the insulated, louvered radiator works better than the un-insulated version when operating at 21 °C. The same is true with the baby buggy concept. When the lunar surface is hot, insulated baby buggy shades work better than un- insulated shades. Table 6. Average Radiator Heat Rejection Avg.

At 54 °C radiator temperature, all louvered radiator configurations provide some amount of heat removal at all solar incidences, with the exception of the 45° un-insulated, louvered radiator and the 120° insulated baby buggy radiator. At 21 °C radiator temperature, however, every radiator configuration eventually reaches a sink temperature higher than its operating temperature, in which the radiator is actually taking on heat rather than rejecting it. For the louvered radiator, the resulting performance averages indicate that at lower incident angles, an un- insulated radiator with downward-pointing louvers works best. At low solar incidence, the lunar surface is cold, thus making a great sink to radiate towards. Conversely at higher incident angles, it becomes somewhat 503</page><page sequence="13">dependent on the radiator temperature. At 21 °C, the radiator can barely reject any heat to the hot lunar surface environment and so it is most beneficial to have an insulated radiator with louvers pointing away from the ground. At 54 °C, however, the radiator is still rejecting a fair amount of heat, even at lunar noon. So in addition to pointing the louvers upward, added heat removal can be done by un-insulating the vertical base and radiating outward. A similar effect can be achieved by pointing the louvers downward and insulating the vertical base. The baby buggy performance trend is somewhat similar. At lower incident angles, low-angle, un-insulated baby buggy shades perform better than high-angle, insulated shades. At higher solar angles, baby buggy performance also becomes dependent upon operating temperature. At 21 °C, high-angle, insulated shading is preferred, while at 54 °C, a low-angle, insulated shade works best. Basically, more shading prevents the hot lunar surface from radiating to the cooler 21 °C radiator surfaces, while less shading allows warmer 54 °C radiator surfaces to radiate to a slightly cooler lunar environment. The primary conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that performance gains in a hot lunar environment are possible with louvered and baby buggy configurations that maximize their view to deep space and insulate from the ground's infrared radiation. The results further indicate that infrared heating is a major concern for EVA in a hot lunar environment. CONCLUSION This paper shows how the EVA thermal environment has been a major design driver for the EVA spacesuit in past manned missions. Along with the lunar thermal environment, crewmember metabolic rates from historical data are reviewed since these rates are closely tied to the working environment and directly affect equipment designs and consumables. The past effects of the lunar environment on spacesuit heat leak are also reviewed, since they too affect spacesuit design requirements. The hot lunar thermal environments are seen to degrade spacesuit radiator performance in the presence of both infrared and solar heat fluxes. Lower radiator performance in turn will require higher dependence on the evaporator system on the PLSS to reject the total EMU heat loads shown in Tables 2 and 5. Several spacesuit-mounted radiator concepts are presented in an attempt to improve spacesuit radiator performance on the lunar surface. The steady-state heat rejection performance of these concepts is shown at various solar angles and operating temperatures. The concepts proposed in this paper use view factor adjusting techniques to protect the radiator surfaces from the hot lunar dayside surface. To help accurately model the lunar surface in the radiator performance analyses, a simplified thermal math model of the lunar surface was presented and used to obtain boundary conditions. The performance findings reveal lunar surface IR and solar trapping to be a major contributor in total heat absorption. REFERENCES 1.
