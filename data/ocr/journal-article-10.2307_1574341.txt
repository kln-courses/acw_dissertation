The duality of the visual arts and the natural sciences had been studied by so many talented writers that one is tempted to say, as did the French writer Jean de La Bruyere (1645-1696) at the beginning of his book 'Les Caracteres': 'Everything has been said and we have come too late ... ' (see also Refs. 1 and 2). But much of what has been published on the duality is, in my opinion, wrong or, at least, short of the mark. To give more impact to my short essay, I shall concentrate on the question: How can one person be both a scientist and a sculptor (even a moderately good one!), since the basic principles and the methods of the sciences and of the arts are so different, if not opposed? I shall try to answer this question. During about the first half of my working life, I was only a physicist. My vivid responses when I contemplated artworks and the exchanges I had about them with other art lovers and, sometimes, with practicing visual artists, writers and composers were of highest importance for the spiritual aspects of my life, but they did not induce me to try to make artworks of my own. My artistic interests, in order of preference, were music, prose works, painting, architecture, poetry and, lastly, sculpture. The order may have been influenced by the dominant roles of music, books and painting in my family circle in France. I found that sculpture in museums and galleries was generally presented badly; the long rows of marbles seemed to me cold, even terrifying, and not conducive to the emotional contact needed for a deep appreciation of artworks of any kind (see Ref. 3). 2. Well, what happened to me? A fortuitous circumstance made me quite suddenly aware of my possible aptitude to make sculptures. In 1938 was spending a few months at a scientific laboratory at the top of the Swiss alp Jung- fraujoch, studying intensely with two colleagues the properties of giant cosmic ray showers impinging on the Earth from outer space. One day at lunch I chatted with a geophysicist who had a large tank full of wax that he used to make models of glaciers in order to study their movements under gravitational force. He showed me his installation and gave me a handful of soft wax to feel how the material yielded when pressed. We had been chatting about mountain animals, such as sledge dogs, and, quite unconsciously, I molded the head of a dog. He said, 'Ah, you are a sculptor'. 'Oh, no!', I replied. He then suggested that I mold something else, for example a chimera, that is, a monster compounded of incongruous parts. I molded one that both he and I felt was rather interesting and, *Physicist, 12 rue Emile Faguet, 75014 Paris, France. (Received 4 Nov. 1980) from that moment, sculpting has given me much satisfaction. Upon my return to Paris, I made over the years a number of small pieces from wax entitled, for example, 'Mother and Child' and 'Return of the Prodigal Son'. The pieces are about 25 cm tall, and in 1978 I decided to have them cast in bronze (for many years, when holding one of my wax pieces, I had the feeling that it was made of bronze); now my collection amounts to 15 bronze pieces. 3. On analyzing my process of making sculpture, I found there occurred a kind of harmonious convergence between an idea, or several ideas, and a sensual, tactile feeling for molding wax. Visual aspects of a piece were secondary to me, they essentially led me to make corrections to what I had first made in order for the piece to correspond to my initial idea or perhaps the mental image of it. In the case of the piece 'Bird' (Fig. 1), the initial idea came to me while I was looking at a collection of saddles in a museum displaying horse riding equipment. I Fig. 1. 'Bird, bronze, 25 x 15 x 8 cm, 1939. 37</page><page sequence="2">suddenly 'saw' in my imagination a saddle with an outstretched head and with the two flaps of the saddle like flapping wings, as though it was taking flight. When I returned home, I modelled in wax, without much deliberation, a saddle with its pommel in the form of an outstretched head with a beak and its cantle in the form of a flat tail, which made the piece look like a very strange bird. As the bird was supposed to be in flight, I mounted the piece on top of a thin metal wire. A similar process led to the piece 'Dance' (Fig. 2). I am a ballet fan, and when watching a dancer leap elegantly, seemingly weightless, I also experience a feeling of weightlessness. The piece I molded in wax consists of a curved dancer's body with a raised leg and a raised hand. The form of the hand suggests a gesture in some Spanish dances and also those of raised open, rigid hands of puppets. The eyes of the dancer are closed; the piece is intended to convey the feeling of a personal, closed, inner world. I mounted it on thin metal wire, but it might be better attached to a vertical wire netting. I said above that the sensual, tactile feeling I experience when molding wax is of primary importance to me. This may explain the simplified form of the piece 'Danceuse hindoue', which tempts her viewers to take her waist in hand with a thumb between her breasts. Being trained as a physicist, I tend to analyze a process or series of events I encounter as not being caused by chance but as manifesting some kind of order. I then search for other such series of events and, perhaps, can propose a hypothesis that will predict their course for experimental verification. Can such a method be applied to the artistic process, which also consists of a series of events? It seems to me that the artistic process I use can be considered to consist of four stages: First, there is the emotional and imaginative stage, for instance, the saddle transformed into a bird taking flight, or the paternal emotion implied in the 'Return of the Prodical Son' or a mother's maternal feeling and love for a child in 'Maternity' (Fig. 3). Second, the mental construct or image is projected onto a material through the sense of touch. Third, the moulded form is corrected through the aid of the sense of sight; for example, to provide a more satisfying inclination of the face of the child looking up at its mother's face (Fig. 3). The third stage, involving changes in angles, relative volumes and details of forms, may take many hours of work, often interrupted by work breaks. Fourth, if a wax piece is to be cast, one must decide whether to make it in some kind of metal, in terracotta or in plaster, then one must consider whether it should be given a patina or otherwise colored and, finally, the support of the piece must be selected. I shall describe the stages of another piece, which is entitled 'Maldoror on the Female Shark' (Fig. 4). I began Fig. 3. 'Maternity', bronze, 17 x 14 x 9 cm, 1938. Y Fig. 2.

Pierre Auger 38 i</page><page sequence="3">The Sculptures of a Physicist it after reading the 'Songs of Maldoror' by the French author le comte de Lautreamont (1846-1870). In one of the 'Songs', Maldoror is practicing (one cannot say enjoying, because of the author's qualifications) sexual intercourse with a female shark in a long, hideous embrace. Having noted that there are slits on both sides of a real shark's head, I felt in my fingers that Maldoror could hold on by slipping his hands inside the slits while sitting on the shark as though on a horse. I then took a piece of wax and molded the first version of the couple. Next, I looked at the version for a long time and added a twist to the shark's tail to symbolize the shark's viciousness and molded Maldoror's head and neck to have a downward curve. I had already decided to have the piece cast in bronze. For its support I at first thought of a base molded with a surface of sea-like waves but decided on a simple slab of wood, as shown in Fig. 4. I later made the piece 'Anadyomena Venus', which has Venus emerging from the waves; I here tried to give one the impression of warmth and softness of a woman's body and hair in contrast with cold and powerful waves. My experience had led me to the conclusion that science and art can 'peacefully coexist' in one's mind, provided one realizes that one must not trespass certain critical guidelines, which I have discussed in Refs. 4 and 5. The confrontation of a scientific hypothesis or a theory with new knowledge leads sometime to what Samuel Butler (1835-1902) in his 'Note Books' called 'the cruel murder of a grand and beautiful theory by a miserable little fact'. However, in the arts, the opinion of the art world about a particular artwork is not final, for one that was regarded with disapproval may at a later time be highly appreciated, because, unlike the absolute character of nature that must be obeyed in the sciences, in the arts there is no absolute system of reference, only the feelings and tastes of humans, which change with time as ways of life change.
