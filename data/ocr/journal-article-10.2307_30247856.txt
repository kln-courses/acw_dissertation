DIX Department of Anthropology Colorado State University ABSTRACT While certain details which characterize "war dogs" are absent from the group of quadrupeds discussed by Jett (1981), their overall forms convey a sharp distinction from the mounted horses in the Spanish Expedition Mural making a hypothetical interpretation possible. Jett's paper is interesting and provocative. Both he and I have studied the Spanish Expedition Mural of Standing Cow Ruin in Canyon del Muerto, Arizona, but appear to disagree on interpretations of several important figures. While both of us rely heavily upon photographs for our interpretations, Jett has climbed the precipitous ledge system and examined the figures at close range and I have not. I worked from pictures taken from the canyon floor with a 35mm Nikon camera using Ektachrome transparency film of various ASA ratings and a lens system ranging up to 600mm. My pictures were taken from a tripod and later projected onto an 8 x 12 foot white screen through a zoom lens that permitted magnifications up to approximately life size. By using two (or more) projec- tors, individual figures or whole panels can be compared. I used this technique extensively while preparing my thesis (Dix 1979) on the rock art in Canyon de Chelly and found this approach, in conjunction with size examinations and detailed notes, to give reproducible data. My response to Jett's paper follows his order of development although I do not comment on each of his points. Finally, a few conclusions are presented. 323</page><page sequence="2">324 THE KIVA Vol. 48, No. 4, 1983 THE SPANISH EXPEDITION MURAL The first question Jett raised is whether this mural portrays Narbona's 1805 raid into the Canyon (Jett 1981:273), a popularly held assumption with only marginal objective support. While it is unlikely that we will ever have certain knowledge as to the specific raid represented, this panorama undoubted- ly expresses a traumatic event similar to the intrusion documented in Narbona's letter. DOGS OR HORSES? The six quadrupeds, tentatively identified as dogs, and particularly the two patterned-coated animals singled out as possible greyhounds, are Jett's major concern (1981:275). I have suggested that the general forms of these six animals are different from the mounted animals in the mural, not only in size and shape but also in relative proportions (Dix 1980). It is acknowledged that certain greyhound characteristics are not seen in the two "greyhounds" (for example, flat ears, "tucked-up" abdomen, curved-up tail). The impression of "greyhoundness" is conveyed, at least to this witness, in spite of these deficien- cies. Further, none of the figures in this scene is realistically rendered, but the horses have a horselike quality and the men have human attributes, even as the dogs possess canine characteristics. It is the artist's purpose to present the illusion of truth rather than a photographic reproduction of an object. Layton (1981: 144) says, "Art objects are not the same as mental images, nor are they the same as the natural things they may depict." In this mural all of the figures are conveyed through symbolic representation. Boas (1955:73) pointed out " ... that in the symbolic method those features are represented that are considered as permanent and essential, and that there is no attempt on the part of the draftsman to confine himself to a reproduction of what he actually sees at a given moment." It is then the overall message, communicated in somewhat abstract terms, that is important rather than the few details that are lacking or inaccurately recorded. If the Spanish used war dogs in these northern Arizona raids, as they traditionally did in Mexico to intimidate natives, it is easy to imagine the terror felt by the Indians even if the events were seen from a distance. No matter how observant an artist may be, details can be forgotten by the time the event is recorded, especially when the components are no longer accessible. What might the artist do in this situation? He could call upon his knowl- edge of similar, more familiar forms. Dogs have been a part of native American life for thousands of years (Colton 1970:153). Olson (1972:52) suggests that the New World dogs were smaller (than Spanish war dogs), had stand-up ears, but lacked "tucked-up" abdomens. Alternately, the Navajo artist may have used ear and tail schemas used for horses. It is also possible that the artist did</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTS 325 not witness the incident himself but created the panorama based on descriptions related to him by others who had. One further point regarding observation and depiction may be made. Most expeditions into unexplored areas of the world during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the voyages of James Cook (Beaglehole 1969), included among their personnel a trained artist. It is interesting to note that these artists almost consistently rendered accurately adorned natives but with Caucasian facial features, if with appropriately colored skin. Their drawings and paintings were usually executed with the person present or from sketches made during a personal encounter. While the Navajo artist undoubtedly painted this mural at his leisure, it is unlikely that he had sketches to refresh his memory. Jett (1981:275) and Grant (1978:226) agree that dogs do not occur in Navajo rock art in Canyon de Chelly. Horses were and still are high-prestige items among the Navajo, in sharp contrast to ubiquitous, low-prestige dogs. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that horses are an important Navajo motif, second only to anthropomorphic forms (Dix 1979:133), while dogs are not. But because dogs are not evident in their rock art here does not mean that they would be excluded in a portrayal of an event in which dogs were major actors. Indeed, if war dogs were a part of the cavalcade, and there is no evidence to the contrary, it would seem incredible that such ferocious and threatening animals would not have a prominent position in the composition. Jett and I agree that, "Western canons of scale and perspective were not necessarily followed by the Navajo artist" (1981:275). What, then, does the relatively small size of these six quadrupeds mean? Does it indicate their lack of importance, a device widely used in many cultures? The detailed coat pattern- ing on two of these creatures argues against that possibility. Perhaps they were a later addition, but with the abundance of open space nearby it seems curious that they were crowded into the limited area between the mounted horses. A number of characteristics are shared by my "greyhounds" and the horse in Jett's Figure 3: geometric coat design, elongated neck, and long body. However, the general proportions of this horse are more similar to many other Navajo horse forms than to the suggested greyhounds, especially the larger one. Jett points out (1981:277) the similarities between the hooves in Figure 3 and most of those in the Standing Cow Ruin Cavalcade. On the other hand, the horse in his Figure 4 is comparable to none of the animals under discussion as possible dogs regarding size, shape, and proportions. The only similarity concerns the hooves, which lack the rounded forms seen in many Navajo horse renderings (Grant 1978:217c, 225, 235f). While water has likely blurred the shield figure associated with the larger patterned "dog," Jett's definitive evidence, " ... the presence in the painting of reins .. ." (198 1:277) seems elusive and, in fact, only one of the riders appears to have reins. I do agree that the shield figure (Jett's Figures 1 and 2) is not</page><page sequence="4">326 THE KIVA Vol. 48, No. 4, 1983 Spanish but as Grant (1978:220) suggests, a native American in service to the Spanish as, perhaps, their walking dog-master. CROSSES AND "PADRES" Is the horseman (Jett 1981:Fig. 1) wearing the cross on his robe a priest or is he a soldier of the military order of Santiago? This, too, is a matter of interpretation. Certainly there have been military orders of priests, but priests not in the military played the larger role in the Spanish conquest of the New World. It seems plausible that padres accompanying such expeditions would carry firearms and might also have dogs. This figure is singled out in a particular way. It is the only one garbed in a distinctive color and embellished with a cross. If nothing else, these features suggest that this is a person of importance. The problem of the crosses may be solved in the same way as the inconsistent details regarding the "greyhounds." The equal-arm "Greek" cross is similar in proportions to Navajo motifs used in basketry, as well as their planetaria (Grant 1978:219, 230, 231). It is possible that the artist transposed the more familiar form, as Jett suggests (1981:278), for the Latin cross used by the Spanish. RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY It is reasonable to assume that this scene was painted over a period of time: days, weeks, perhaps months, possibly years or even centuries. It is also likely that several artists worked on the mural (accounting for style differences), using a number of different paint sources (accounting for variations in paint quality and colors). The relative age of various segments of this pictograph can be determined only through detailed chemical analysis of the paint. Differential weathering due to only slight changes in exposure and rock composition, amounts of seepage, differences in paint components and application, render visual estimates of relative age inadequate. The superposition of some minor details enumerated by Jett (1981:278) does support his contention that these animals ("dogs") are "younger." How much younger cannot be determined without chemical analysis. Perhaps they were added a week later or years later. At least it may be hypothesized that they were added because it was felt that dogs were an important part of this Navajo-Spanish story. CONCLUSIONS Jett's main objection to classifying these animals as "war dogs" depends on the absence of certain greyhound characteristics (that is, ear, tail, abdomen</page><page sequence="5">COMMENTS 327 forms) and further, that these are depicted in a manner similar to horse forms. I agree. But these are only details. It is the overall statement that must be evaluated. It is the illusion of truth that must be considered. Goya's painting Shooting of the Rebels of May 3, 1808 is a strong statement which conveys his horror of war, but he rejected sharp detail in favor of suggested forms, the illusion of truth. The animals in this group, including the "greyhounds" and other dogs, differ in size, shape, proportion, and arrangement from other quadrupeds in this panorama and from horse forms elsewhere in the canyon system. Although we may analyze, measure, compare, and theorize about this mural, the intent of the artisl(s) will never be known. We can only present our observations and interpretations in as objectively a manner as possible. After noting Jett's objections to my "war dogs," I carefully reexamined my many detailed slides of the mural with his alternative interpretations in mind. For the reasons presented above, however, my conviction that these six quadrupeds were meant to represent dogs has been reinforced. Thus, I remain convinced that it is reasonable to interpret this panel as showing that Spanish conquistadors used war dogs on the northern frontier of Mexico. REFERENCES Beaglehole, J. C.
