<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ornamentation of the Sansa BERTIL SODERBERG The sansa is an African musical instrument belonging to the group "plucked idiophones" in which the sound is produced by the bending and release of one (as in the Jew's harp) or a series of wooden or metal lamellae. The lamellae of a sansa are fixed to a sound board consisting of a flat piece of wood to which a wooden sound box or gourd resonator is often added. The player holds the front portion of the sansa in both hands, plucking the lamellae with his thumbs. For this reason, the sansa is sometimes referred to as the thumb-piano, although a num- ber of other names, such as mbira, have also been used to denote this instrument. The music produced on the sansa is soft, and usually serves as an accom- paniment to songs and sometimes dances. Children use simple sansas in playing guessing games, and guards play it while on watch during the night. In the colonial era, the sansa was used by some bearers to accompany the caravans on route. In some areas, it is connected with various aspects of an entire society, as among the Lemba;1 in other areas, the background of the sansa is grounded in mythology.2 Numerous variations of sansas exist, many of which are more or less orna- mented. This ornamentation is made (OPPOSITE PAGE) 1. TWO OBLONG BOX SANSAS OF THE TYPE FOUND IN SOUTHEAST NIGERIA, CAMEROON, GABON AND THE LOWER CONGO. WOOD. ETNO- GRAFISKA MUSEET, STOCKHOLM. (ABOVE) 2.

Although the orna- mentation of the sansa has apparently not been greatly dealt with by musi- cologists, some work has been done: Dr. Maes has shown the symbolic meaning of the decoration of musical instruments;3 Dr. Laurenty (to whom I owe a great deal for this study) has a chapter on the decoration of the sansa in his excellent work, Les sanza du Congo;4 and some sansas, such as those of the Chokwe, have been mentioned and described in art books. The techniques involved in the decoration of sansas vary. Generally, however, they primarily include en- graving with a hot metal point (pyro- graphics), blackening with a metal tool, and sculpting or incising with a knife and other tools. Leaves or palm oil are often used to polish the surface. Sansa decorative motifs may com- prise simple designs, more elaborate geometrical ornaments, geometrical or figural engravings, the application of brass tacks, and the carving of zoo- morphic and anthropomorphic sculp- tures. The Ngombe tribe, in the region near the bend of the Congo River, sometimes inserts beads into the resin along the border of the sansa. Although some sansas do not have any particu- larly elaborate decoration, they may often have, for instance, a rod with iron beads or one or more blue glass beads loosely affixed to the iron lamellae. Shells (patella) can be found on the anterior part of the sound boards of sansas used by the Tonga-Chopi in 3. SANSA. IBO, NIGERIA. WOOD, POLYCHROME.

The loosely attached shells make a rattling sound when the instrument is played, as do the small stones or nutshells put inside the sound box of some sansas (Fig. 4). Simple pyrographic designs are made on sansas which have a bark sound box with a wooden sound board. This type of sansa is used by the tribes in the northeastern region of Zaire. Parallel lines are drawn on the sound board to form arched figures which cross each other, square figures, stars and triangles, and even a very stylized human figure. There are modifications of these patterns on different speci- mens. Other types, also from Zaire, have very simple pyrographic decoration. A more elaborate, seemingly pyro- graphed decorative pattern has been found on a sansa called Tyisanji tya kele5 in northeast Angola. The anterior corner of the sound board has a pattern with lines forming rhombic figures. This type of instrument is made of palm stalks with wooden lamellae. Even more developed geometrical ornamentation has been noted on a sansa6 from Nigeria (Fig. 8) which has a large square sound board with a double keyboard of lamellae placed side by side. The decoration primarily consists of lines of square figures, each 30</page><page sequence="4">of which has one or more lines crossing inside. These square figures are found incised in three lines on the anterior part of the sound board, in two lines on the posterior part, and in one line in the middle between the keyboards. At the sides of the anterior part are two parasol figures. Another type of sansa from south- east Nigeria7 and the Cameroons, which I call the oblong box sansa, usually has eight wooden lamellae (Fig. 1). This sansa has spread to Gabon and the Lower Congo. The technique of ornamentation combines the scorching of large areas and the engraving of lines with a hot iron point. The patterns consist of flowing leaf- like forms on the top and bottom; the sides have geometrical decorations in rhombic and triangular forms or checked patterns. The ornamentation and construction of the sound box, which is made of six thin pieces of wood, point to the Ekoi-Ibibio culture complex. This was noted by William Fagg in a catalogue of the Ethnographi- cal Museum, Gothenburg, where three sansas are kept.8 Similar patterns of engraved flowing leaf-forms are also used on wooden fans among the Ibibio. According to Margaret Trowell, this is typical of the work of eastern Nigeria.9 This flower and leaf-form pattern is, however, quite unusual in African art, and it might be possible that it is a result of contact with western influence. This acculturation phenom- enon is quite clear in the decoration of a sansa from the upper Uelle region of Zaire, on which the letters A, I and K are engraved. On another sansa from the same region a series of arches and double line triangles are incised.'? The sansa of the Fang type from Gabon and the Cameroons has a form resembling a miniature mixing-trough or cradle (Fig. 2). Six to eight lamellae are fixed to the sound board. On one side of the sound box a triangular or irregular-shaped sound hole is made. Patterns of arched lines, parallelo- grams, star forms or simple designs are used. In some cases, only one side is decorated; in other cases, the sound board and both sides are ornamented. The most notable of the sansas with incised decoration are those made by the Chokwe and the Lunda. Marie- Louise Bastin in her book Art decoratif Tchokwe, has published excellent re- productions of such sansas." These are classified by Laurenty as the North- Angola-Kasai type, based on a geo- graphical denomination. The instru- ment is particularly characterized by the forms of its bridge: the anterior bridge is of bent band-iron; the posterior bridge consists of a parallel- epipedic wooden piece; and the pressing bridge is an iron rod bent into a U-form. There are some with one row of lamellae; others have two rows, in which case the lamellae are shorter. On some of these sansas, a rod with iron beads is affixed to the anterior end of the sound board. The decorative motifs of Chokwe sansas correspond in some cases to motifs used on other objects. There are sansas with incised geometrical patterns often in four-square and rhombic forms. There are also rounded patterns in rows made by a heated nailhead on the posterior part of the sound board. Other geometrical decorations take the form of arches, or rounded, incised curves or spirals. These patterns emerge from a tradi- tional context; for instance, the spiral decoration is designed to imitate brass arm rings which are made in a similar form; another pattern of concentric circles is meant to denote eyes, while still others appear to imitate a female abdominal tattoo. The human face in bas-relief, which is found on some Chokwe sansas, represents the female mask called mukishiwa pwo. Sometimes there will be one head in the center of the decora- tion with a frieze of lines around it, while at other times there may be as many as four small heads of the female mask. A Luvale sansa in the National Museum of Zambia has a carved head in bas-relief which depicts a likisi mask used during the boys' initiation ceremonies (Fig. 9). It corresponds to the Chokwe female mask. Anthropomorphic sculptures on sansas are rare; somewhat more fre- quent are sansas with sculptured heads protruding from the posterior end of the sound box. Bastin has repro- duced two fine examples called kako- londondo among the Chokwe. One has a female head with tattooing under the eyes, the other a protruding male head with a prominent chin as its charac- teristic mark.'2 Another interesting sansa from Douala, Cameroon, which was discovered several decades ago, has a protruding bust of a human being.13 From the Ubangi in Zaire come sansas each with a protruding human head which is used as a sup- 8.

Sansas of the statuette type are of particular interest. A notable example, found among the Azande, is made in the shape of a woman (Fig. 7). The sound box with wooden lamellae is fixed to the abdomen. The head on a long neck and the upward stretching arms are on the posterior end, and the slightly bent legs are at the anterior 9. SANSA.

The body con- sists of an oval corpus with a sound board on the front side (Fig. 10).15 An extremely rare Mayombe sansa with a rectangular sound box and a sculptured female figure sitting with crossed legs and a child on her knees is reserved for chiefs or medicine men, and according to Maes, is used by them only on certain special oc- casions. The figure is supposed to represent the dignity of the owner or the commemoration of a clan chief of the matrilineal kin.16 Zoomorphic sculptures are also very rare. The collection of the Horniman Museum, London, includes an example from the Ibo of Nigeria which consists of an oblong box sansa with wooden lamellae and a bird standing on the posterior edge (Fig. 3). Applications of imported brass tacks have been used for ornamenting sansas, especially in the Lower Congo. The tacking may be done in different ways. One or several lines of tacks are quite common; brass ornaments in the form of an anchor, a half moon with a star, and even the wheel of a watch, in addition to other small imported ob- jects may be used (Fig. 5). Captain J. K. Tuckey who explored the Congo River (then called Zaire) in 1816 found and described a sansa from the Lower Congo: "The body is of wood much lighter than deal; the bridge and the eleven bars which it supports are of iron; they are confined by a strip of bamboo fixed to the body or frame by strings of leather; and they rest also on a piece of skin. The circular ornament is part of the brass frame of a print or looking-glass; and the circles are French brass buttons with the head of Louis XVI on them. The tones are soft, and by no means unpleasing."17 The musicologist Carl Engel refers to this passage as an example of how "primitive peoples" decorate their musical instruments.'8 The different shapes of the sansas are in themselves examples of the African genius for using different materials to create an individual instru- ment of often striking esthetic quality. A particular sansa, known as likembe, has been used as a secondary motif in modern figural sculpture. An example is the statuette "Joueur de likembe" by the African sculptor Mayele.19 Symbolic meaning is sometimes attached to the sansa or parts of it. In discussing the sansa shown in Figure 7, Maes suggested that the stylized figure might be a symbol of gladness, astonishment and surprise. Roumeguere-Eberhardt, who has studied the symbolism of the sansa among the Lemba, found that the sansa known as deza symbolizes the entire social group of a village. Some decora- tions, such as three triangles on the left side, represent the huts of the men, while a hole in the sound board is said to symbolize a young de- flowered girl. There are in all some twenty different parts of the instrument which have special symbolic meaning. Roumeguere-Eberhardt obtained her information from an initiated Lemba man which would seem to attest to its validity. The ornamentation of the sansa re- flects many aspects of African art. President Senghor of Senegal has noted that the arts of the African Negro are expressed in image and rhythm, and as he puts it "l'image rythme."20 This idea is mirrored in the morphol- ogy and decoration of the sansa: the instrument representing the "image," and the rhythm being heard as it is played upon. The examples of the sansa used here are fairly typical, but there are many other varieties. It is hoped that the study of sansa orna- mentation will be continuously broad- ened to include the ornamentation of other African musical instruments, resulting in a wide and rewarding field for future research. a Notes, page 88 10.

DALLAS MUSEUM, Notes,from page 19 1. I should like to express my sincere appreciation for the continuing interest shown by Clark and Frances Stillman in the documentation and use of the part of their collection now at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. Both Mr. and Mrs. Stillman are ready at any time to work with the mus- eum staff in any way that may lead to the further enrich- ment of the collection. Two publications have been done specifically on the Stillman Collection: (1) The Museum of Primitive Art, The Clark and Frances Stillman Collection of Congolese Sculpture; New York, 1965 (listing 240 pieces and illustrating 35); and (2) The Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, The Clark and Frances Stillman Collection of Congo Sculpture; Dallas, 1969 (listing 139 pieces out of 233 owned by the museum and illustrating 35, 29 of them not illustrated in the MPA catalogue). The Dallas catalogue includes an essay by the Stillmans on the formation of the collection. This (along with conversations with Mr. and Mrs. Stillman) has been the source for the section on the assembly of the collection. Mr. Stillman also contributed an essay, "Congolese Art in Europe and America" to Walker Art Center, Art of the Congo (Minneapolis, 1967), which accompanied a loan exhibition from the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren. In selecting illustrations to accompany this article I intentionally selected examples which did not figure in either of the above-mentioned publications. 2. One of these (Inside FrontCover) is similarto examples in the British Museum illustrated in Ekhard von Sydow, Afrikanische Plastik (New York, 1954), plates 84 B, C, D, where two are given to the Tetela group. Along with a Lega and a Pende mask, it was illustrated in the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts Newsletter for December 1971. 3. Elsy Leuzinger, African Sculpture (Zurich, 1963), p. 178. 4.

Maravi is the ancient name of the peoples living north of the Zambezi between the Shire and Luangwa Rivers, an area which covers parts of present day Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. These people shared a common culture and language, now known as Chichewa. The alternative spelling of "Malawi" is used in this article to indicate the modern Republic of that name. 2. J. A. R.
