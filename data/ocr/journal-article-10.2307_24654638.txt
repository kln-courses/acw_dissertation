<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Indian Buddhists &amp; Their Tibetan Successors. London, Serindia Publications, 1987. xxiv, 640 pp., pi. £30.00. David Snellgrove retired in 1982 from his chair of Tibetan studies in the university of London. The present publication shows that he has used his retirement to write a comprehensive work on Buddhism in India, Central Asia, Nepal and Tibet up to about 1300 A.D. Snellgrove's book comprises five chapters of unequal length: I. Origins in India (pp. 1—43); II. Later developments in India (pp. 44—116); III. Tantric Buddhism (pp. 117—303); IV. Buddhist communities in India and beyond (pp. 305—380); V. The conversion of Tibet (pp. 381—526). In his preface Snellgrove explains his reasons for dealing only briefly with the Buddhist origins in India: "For the first chapter on Buddhist origins Indo-Iranian Journal 32: 1989.</page><page sequence="2">220 REVIEWS in India there is already a very large amount of published work available, mainly in English, but also in French and German. This subject is thus comparatively easily treated, and one's main task in this case is to correct the liberal-minded rationalizing approach, from which the retelling of Säkyamuni's life may suffer distortion." It is certainly true that much more has been written on the Buddhist origins in India than on Tantrism and the conversion of Tibet to Buddhism but whether this subject is therefore comparatively easily treated is another matter. For instance, in recent years several scholars have been trying to determine the nature of the earliest Buddhist doctrine by distinguishing different layers in the sütras, by isolating verse passages and by comparing Buddhist doctrines with Jain doctrines and teachings found in the Upanisads. Snellgrove does not once refer to the writings of scholars such as Schmithausen and Vetter in Europe and Aramaki and Nakamura in Japan. Secondly, one wonders whether it is still necessary in the nineteen-eighties to correct the liberal-minded rationalizing approach which was widespread towards the end of the last century and which is only rarely found in recent times. It was obviously Snellgrove's intention to dwell only briefly on topics which have already been studied by other scholars unless he considered it necessary to correct wrong ideas. It is necessary to keep this in mind when reading Snellgrove's book and not to expect a well-balanced treatment of the various aspects of Buddhism. Snellgrove has made a wide use of Sanskrit and Tibetan materials, trans lating many passages of hitherto untranslated texts. In the case of texts already translated he presents his own translations. The first two chapters deal mainly with HTnayäna and Mahäyäna. Snellgrove stresses that one cannot treat them as two distinct phases: "They may be regarded, however, as two fluctuating tendencies, usually mingling together, and only kept strictly apart in certain philosophical texts" (p. 32). He also points out that in Mahäyäna Säkyamuni, the Buddha of the present world-age, remains the centre of Buddhist devotion. According to Snellgrove "The central object of worship was in the first instance the stüpa and then later as the anthropomorphic form of £äkyamuni was elaborated, the Buddha-image itself, either superimposed upon the stüpa or enthroned alone" (p. 51). In chapter four Snellgrove remarks that in the seventh century Hsiian-tsang is greatly interested in all the historical and legendary sites connected with Säkyamuni's life and that the only celestial Bodhisattvas, whose cult impressed him, are Maitreya and Avalokitesvara. He also points out that there seems to be a time lag of two or three centuries between Mahäyäna sütras preaching the benefits of devotion to other Buddhas as well as Säkyamuni and their iconographical representation. As to Tantric iconography Snellgrove writes that "there is little surviving iconographie</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 221 material that can be firmly classed as tantric earlier than the ninth century" (p. 316). Snellgrove makes no reference to inscriptions but it is interesting to note that the oldest mention of the term Mahäyäna is found in an inscription dated A.D. 507—8.1 Although the oldest Mahäyäna texts were probably written already in the first century B.C., it seems that the senti ment of belonging to a specific and different school of Buddhism was felt only after a lapse of several centuries. Snellgrove does not attach much importance to the influence of layfolk on the development of Mahäyäna: "It is sometimes suggested that the Mahäyäna represents a more popular form of Buddhism in which the attitudes and aspirations of the layfolk are accorded greater scope, but such a suggestion, while partly true, can also be quite misleading. There would seem to be no doubt that the real protagonists of the Mahäyäna were monks, and the new scriptures were compiled by monks, some of whom were renowned as masters of philosophy. Also the career of the Bodhisattva, as described in the texts, assumes that the life of a monk and at least a life of celibacy are essential conditions for his progress" (pp. 62—63). It is a pity that Snellgrove does not discuss in greater detail the role of the layfolk in the development of Mahäyäna. Since the publication of Hirakawa's article on 'The Rise of Mahäyäna Buddhism and Its Relation to the Worship of Stupas' in 1963,2 the influence of lay-followers especially with regard to the worship of stupas has been a lively subject of discussion in Japan.3 Probably some scholars have overrated the importance of lay followers, but one must not forget the fact that the Mahäyäna sütras are inspired by a very different spirit. It is perhaps not inappropriate to quote the following words by Étienne Lamotte: "Le Mahäyäna est traversé de part en part par un esprit laïc et démocratique. Les Mahäyänasütra ne s'adressent plus avant tout aux moines qui ont quitté leur maison pour mener une vie errante, mais aux nobles fils et filles de famille demeurés dans le siècle."4 On p. 7 Snellgrove remarks that the story of Säkyamuni's life was regarded as representing the set course that any Buddha should follow in his last life in this world and that it was defined as the Twelve Acts of a Buddha. To my knowledge the Twelve Acts of the Buddha (mdzad-pa bcu gnis) are not mentioned in Indian Buddhist texts but have been formulated for the first time in Tibet. In an article published in 1839 Csoma de Körös gave a list of the twelve acts which is different from the one published by Snellgrove.5 It would have been very welcome if such an excellent specialist in Tibetan Buddhism as Snellgrove would have given us some more infor mation on the origin and history of the different lists of the Twelve Acts. Whereas chapters one, two and four suffer somewhat from the fact that</page><page sequence="4">222 REVIEWS Snellgrove tried to deal with many topics without being able to treat them adequately within the limited space given to them, a much more satisfactory picture is to be found in chapters three and five which deal respectively with Tantric Buddhism and the conversion of Buddhism. Snellgrove is one of the leading specialists in Buddhist Tantrism. His edition and translation of the Hevajratantra (London, 1959) is one of the best studies of a Tantric text ever published. His book-length chapter on Tantrism is a major contribution to the study of Tantrism and will be welcomed both by the general public and by specialists. The Tantric litera ture is very vast and only very few texts have been adequately studied by modern scholars. What Snellgrove has achieved in this chapter is an over view which forms a solid basis for further studies. He makes a distinction "between Mahäyäna Buddhism including those tantras that are closely relatable on the one hand and the form of tantric Buddhism, which may accurately be described as Vajrayäna, on the other" (p. 279). According to Snellgrove the traditional arrangement of four categories of tantras (kriyä, caryä, yoga and anuttarayoga) is of a rather arbitrary nature (p. 119, n. 5). He devotes one section to various kinds of tantra in which he distinguishes tantras relatable to Mahäyäna sütras and tantras with non-Buddhist associations (pp. 147—160). To these later groups belong the anuttarayoga tantras which introduce many new and un-Buddhist concepts. Throughout this chapter on Tantrism Snellgrove shows the progressive tantric develop ment from Mahäyäna sütras to Vajrayäna tantras. In the course of his treatment he explains the main characteristics of the tantric literature such as magical formulas, mandalas, Buddha-families, initiations and consecra tions, etc. Snellgrove takes great pains to determine the meaning of impor tant tantric concepts: siddha, sädhana, vajra, vidyä, hrdaya, bïja and samaya, etc. Nobody will read this chapter without learning much about Buddhist tantrism. Especially welcome are the many passages from tantric texts of which most have not been translated before. One of the texts most quoted by Snellgrove is the Sarvatathägatatattva samgraha which Snellgrove has studied for many years. In 1959 he announced the discovery of an early manuscript of it in Nepal. In 1981 Snellgrove published a facsimile edition of this manuscript provided with a long introduction of more than sixty pages.6 In the same year Isshi Yamada brought out a romanised edition of this same manuscript compared with the Tibetan and Chinese translations.7 Recently Lokesh Chandra published a devanägari edition which we have not yet been able to consult.8 The STTS has also been edited in Japan by Horiuchi Kanjin.9 In translating passages from the STTS Snellgrove refers only to Yamada's edition. Even with the</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 223 help of the editions by Yamada and Horiuchi many problems remain. For instance, on p. 138 Snellgrove translates: "They replied: "Let it be so, we enter into this pledge of yours."". Yamada's edition reads: ta evam ähuh / "evam astv iti / kin tu tava samayam [akovidäh]"/. Yamada remarks in a note that the word akovidäh is illegible. Both the Tibetan and the Chinese versions translate 'we do not understand'. Horiuchi reads: kim tu [ vayam \ bhaga[vad- (or °vatah) äjnä-samayam näva (or adhi)- gacchämah].10 Snellgrove's translation is not accompanied by philological notes and it is difficult to know how he arrived at his interpretation. It is very much to be hoped that Snellgrove will publish an edition and translation of the STTS as he has done so admirably for the Hevajratantra. Snellgrove's translations are not always free from errors. On p. 126 he translates a passage from the Mahäyänasüträlamkara (ed. S. Lévi, p. 87, line 7): yasmäd dharmadhâtuvinirmukto dharmo nâsti dharmatàvyatirekena dharmäbhävät : "As there is no element apart from the elemental sphere, so there is no essential truth (or elemental essence, dharmatä) apart from the elements." The meaning is just the opposite: "As there is no element apart from the elemental sphere because there is no element apart from the elemental essence." Snellgrove refers to Lévi's translation which he mis understood: "Puisqu'il n'y a pas d'Idéal qui soit émancipé du Plan des Idéaux — en effet, pas d'Idéal sans Idéalité." The Sekoddesatïkâ mentions a Wisdom-maiden (prajnä) from twelve to twenty years old. Snellgrove says that she is from sixteen to twelve years old (p. 263). Chapter V The Conversion of Tibet' (pp. 381—526) describes the back ground to the introduction of Buddhism, the first diffusion of Buddhism during the eighth and ninth centuries and the second diffusion from about the year 1000 onwards. Snellgrove insists on the fact that Bon was not the original pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet but a heterodox form of Buddhism. He draws attention to the close relationship between Bonpos and rNiri-ma pas. Snellgrove writes: "They differ from more orthodox Buddhists in their joint possession of the teachings known as the Great Fulfillment (rdzogs chen), in their separate possession of groups of tantras that were excluded from the later Tibetan Buddhist Canon, and in their tardy development of monastic orders, both preserving a long tradition of noncelibate religious practice" (p. 404). Buddhism was introduced to Tibet both from China and India. Accord ing to Snellgrove the period of Chinese influence was limited to the short period during which the Tibetans controlled Central Asia and northwest China. After the disintegration of the Tibetan empire from 842 onward India became the dominating factor. As to the famous council held either</page><page sequence="6">224 REVIEWS in Lhasa or bSam-yas Snellgrove points out that the Chinese teacher Mahäyäna taught doctrines derived from the teachings of the Mind Only school and similar to those found in Yoga Tantras promulgated in Tibet from the eighth century onward. He describes very well the complicated religious situation in Tibet during the eighth and ninth centuries. It is only in recent years that due to the study of the Bon religion, of the teachings of the rNiri-ma-pa school and of the Tun-huang manuscripts that it has become clear that later Tibetan historians have misrepresented the history of Buddhism during the first diffusion. For the later period as from 1000 much useful material is to be found in the Tibetan religious histories and Snellgrove quotes abundantly from the Blue Annals written by 'Gos Lo-tsa ba gzon-nu-dpal (1392—1481). In this chapter Snellgrove has given us a masterful exposé based on original sources and the work done by scholars in this century. Especially for the period of the seventh to the tenth century Snellgrove's work is without doubt the best available at present. He is in full command of his sources and his long experience with Tibetan sources and with living Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal and Ladakh inspires his writing. On pp. 446—449 Snellgrove quotes extensively from a letter written by the Indian scholar Buddhaguhya to king Khri Sroh-lde-brtsan. He considers the letter to be genuine but doubts as to the authenticity remain. In an article published in 1968 Hadano maintained that the letter is a late forgery.11 Snellgrove's translation is based upon the Peking and Narthang Tanjurs. He does not mention Siglinde Dietz's dissertation Die buddhistische Briefliteratur Indiens (Bonn, 1980) in which she studies the same letter. Dietz's dissertation has been published in a revised version as volume 84 of the Asiatische Forschungen (Wiesbaden, 1984) to which we refer. Dietz's edition of the text of the letter is based upon the Peking, Narthang, Derge and Chone Tanjurs. On p. 448 Snellgrove translates: "One's later knowledge is commingled with (existing) knowledge. The essential property of mind is wealth of knowledge, I say." In Dietz's edition the text reads: rdzas kyi ses pa ses pa'i nan na dbul / sems kyi mtshan hid ses pa phyug ces mchi'o "The knowledge of material things is poverty among knowledges. Knowledge of the essential nature of the mind is richness. So it is said." Siglinde Dietz translates: "Man biete sein Wissen über materielle Dinge unter Weisen dar, [dann] wird man reich [an] Wissen [hinsichtlich] des Charakters des Geists genannt [werden]" (p. 371). Dietz is correct in reading rdzas and not rjes as found in the Narthang and Peking texts but her translation is wrong. Snellgrove remarks that the Tibetan translation of this letter is filled with strange obscurities. Further study of this important document is certainly required.</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 225 In translating passages from the Blue Annals Snellgrove does not always correct mistakes made by Roerich. For instance, on p. 476 he follows Roerich in restoring Tshad-ma rgyan to Nyäyälamkära. Tshad-ma rgyan translates Sanskrit Pramänälamkära of which the full title is Pramänamahä bhäsyavärttikälamkära.12 In another passage Roerich's translation is correct and Snellgrove has misread the text. Roerich has: "Better than this trance, is the trance of the gods of the rüpa and arüpa dhätus who are able to meditate throughout an entire cosmic period" (Roerich, The Blue Annals, II, p. 455). Snellgrove mentions a trance devoid of sensations (p. 495) but the Tibetan text has: mi 'chor-ba'i tin-ne-'dzin 'a trance which does not pass away' and not mi 'tshor-ba'i tin-ne-'dzin. Snellgrove's book contains an extensive bibliography but many books and articles mentioned in the notes, often without sufficient details, are not mentioned in it. Information on texts is not always correct. For instance, Snellgrove says that the editions of the Catuhsataka by Bhattacharya and Vaidya contain the edited Sanskrit and Tibetan texts for chapters VIII—XVI and that the Sanskrit is missing for the earlier chapters (p. 85, n. 69). There are fragments of the Sanskrit text of both the verses and Candrakirti's commentary for all sixteen chapters. Both Bhattacharya and Vaidya have not only edited the Sanskrit text of the verses found in the fragments but have also tried to reconstruct the text of the verses not found in them. Snellgrove states that Emmerick has translated the Tibetan version of the Sürarigamasamädhisütra supplemented by a fragmentary Khotanese version (p. 632). However, Emmerick has only translated from the Tibetan passages missing in the Khotanese and has not translated the sections to which nothing corresponds in the Khotanese. To sum up. Snellgrove's book is an important contribution to the study of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism and especially the two long chapters on Tantrism and The Conversion of Tibet deserve the highest praise. Minor flaws in the philological study of the texts do not impair the value of this work and have only been pointed out because Snellgrove himself (and rightly so) sets a high value on philological exactitude.
