<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conference Report Beyond Biography: Seventh International Congress on Women in Music Utrecht, The Netherlands 29 May-2 June 1991 Music and Gender Conference King's College, London 5-7 July 1991 Marcia J. Citron 533 With three major conferences in a period of six weeks, the summer of 1991 marked another watershed for feminist musicology. The activity began in Holland, continued in Minneapolis, and concluded in London. While the quality and sophistication of the Minneapolis conference would be hard to equal, the gatherings in Utrecht and London each had something special to offer. For Holland and England, each conference represented more than a coming together of scholars in a given field. It served as a sign of legitimation of women and music within that country: that there is a rich history of women in music, that it is being investigated by respected scholars around the world, and that women as musical sub- jects have a strong voice that warrants recognition. In some respects, each country now stands at a point where the US stood some ten years ago, when the first major conference on women and music took place (First National Congress on Women in Music, New York, 1981). Ex- pectedly that gathering emphasized recovery of lost figures, and work on women represented a new area within musicology as a whole. It Volume IX * Number 4 * Fall 1991 The Journal of Musicology ? 1991 by the Regents of the University of California</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY was pre-Bowers/Tick, pre-Briscoe, and pre-McClary,l and only a few editions and recordings existed. Feminism as an interdisciplinary methodology would enter the field several years later. In the European conferences the legitimizing function permeated the events. The introduction to the Utrecht program booklet, for example, pointed out the striking fact that seven women scholars were presenting the lectures-striking within the context of how few fe- male musicologists there are in Dutch universities. Furthermore, the Dutch woman composer of past and present served as subtext and pretext for the congress, as symbolized by the striking portrait of composer Henriette Bosmans (1895-1952) on the conference poster. While the London conference did not stress an English protagonist, shadow or otherwise, it too had some practical aims. Planner Sophie Fuller, for example, noted (in Utrecht) that it was hoped that the London conference would help launch a feminist musicology pro- gram in Britain. Thus while each event drew on native talent, it cast a global net to demonstrate the international presence and quality of feminism in music scholarship and thereby create needed visibility and validity for women in music in its own country. This geographical 534 sweep made for richly textured events. But while similar in their international participation and general emphasis on women and music, the two events differed in many respects. Utrecht stressed concerts and thus resembled a festival more than a conference. Perhaps this was to be expected given the strong presence of composers in the International Congress on Women in Music, an organization closely affiliated (now merged) with the Inter- national League of Women Composers. As the title indicates this was the seventh such congress. The first took place in 1981, and the sites have been diverse, for example Mexico City, Heidelberg, New York, and Madrid (in 1992). This congress was planned, organized, and funded locally, without the umbrella organizations, which were in the midst of consolidation. The London conference was independent from predecessors or larger organizations, although Women in Mu- sic, a fairly new British group, was instrumental in bringing the event to fruition. More like a typical conference, papers formed the core, although several concerts were sprinkled throughout the three-day event. The jam-packed program resulted from the desire to have as many voices as possible represented. This meant that most sessions Women Making Music: The Western Art Tradition, 1150-1950, ed. Jane Bowers and Judith Tick (Urbana, IL, 1986); Historical Anthology of Music by Women, ed. James Briscoe (Bloomington, IN, 1987); and Susan McClary, Feminine Endirgs: Music, Gender, and Sexuality (Minneapolis, MN, 1991).</page><page sequence="3">CONFERENCE REPORT ran parallel to others and that presentations had to be fairly brief. In Utrecht, however, the philosophy was to have only a few speakers. This allowed considerably more time for each presentation, meant that everyone could attend every event, and fostered greater interac- tion among the speakers. Most of the audience consisted of compos- ers, who probably attended the Congress mainly for the concerts. Many had their works performed. In London the audience exhibited much greater diversity. Although there were many composers, there was also a large number of presenters (over fifty), and this included musicologists of many stripes as well as music educators and music administrators. Both events were organized by composers: Tera de Marez Oyens in Utrecht and Nicola LeFanu in London. One could not choose a lovelier site for a conference than Utrecht, a small city dating back to Roman times. An architectural gem, it has the charming canals associated with Amsterdam and lacks the noise, crowds, and other drawbacks of big cities or major tourist attractions. Its leisurely ambience corresponded to the rather ex- tended pacing of the Congress. This was true even though events ran from mid-morning to late at night, with little time scheduled for meals. But the plenary structure and longer papers promoted a sense 535 of ease and forestalled the anxiety of running between sessions, as in London (and Minneapolis). The lectures took place mostly in the morning and the remainder of the day focused on concerts. Among the seven principal speakers four were foreign (two from the US, one each from Germany and Austria) and three were Dutch. Most of the presentations focused on broad issues. These, as well as the two pa- pers on more specific topics, exemplified the conference theme of "Beyond Biography." Eva Rieger, the leading feminist musicologist in Germany, ex- plored the daunting and important issue of the possibility of a female aesthetic. Are there stylistic or other compositional traits that charac- terize the way a woman in the singular or women in the plural express themselves in music? Noting that the presentation represents general impressions more than formalized theories, Rieger stressed that one cannot "prove" the existence of a female aesthetic. She concluded that there is no essentialist female aesthetic but nonetheless believes that certain tendencies characterize many works by women. The seven tendencies she identified, which include an emphasis on functional- ism, communication, and holism, are also available to men. My pre- sentation, "Gender and the Canon: Aspects of Creativity," preceded Rieger's talk. The second day featured perhaps the most popular paper on the program, Elizabeth Wood's "Lesbian Fugue: Ethel Smyth's</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY Contrapuntal Arts." Here Wood forged new paths in terms of biog- raphy. She engaged the issue of how one writes musically about a person: in this case, structuring her presentation as a fugue, much like the contrapuntal strands of Smyth's life and music in the period under discussion. In addition, Wood's open exploration of Smyth's lesbianism indicates a sexual frankness about women that is just be- ginning to surface in musicology. The presentation itself was a de- light. Wood, a novelist as well as scholar, is a master of dramatic nuance and she uses her voice as effectively as a performance artist. As for the text, it was rich, metaphorical, and suggestive rather than conclusive, a strategy often employed by feminist writers. These traits also characterized the next paper. Joke Dame (pronounced Jok'-ah Dah'-mah), at the University of Amsterdam, is doing fascinating work on the cultural and gendered meanings of the musical voice. In "Un- veiled Voices: Sexual Difference and the Castrato," Dame utilized interdisciplinary theory in a critique of the notion of the castrato as a sexual neuter, as promulgated by Roland Barthes in his essay S/Z. Rather than destroying difference, such neutering actually reinforces difference but in a destructive way. Dame sees this move as part of the 536 larger issue of the meaning of the androgyne. She applied these ideas to historical interpretations of the castrato and showed how our con- ceptions of the sexuality of the castrato can make a difference in musical realizations originally intended for that voice type. Later that day, in a more traditional vein, Helen Metzelaar of Amsterdam de- livered a paper on the status of Dutch research on women and em- phasized that considerable work still needs to be done in basic recu- peration of the who, what, and when. While an interesting, wide- ranging presentation, I found the title, "In Defense of Biography," a bit puzzling because it connotes opposition and a sense of being under attack. Perhaps the conference theme of "Beyond Biography" sug- gested the need for a defensive posture, but the paper title implies an unnecessary polarization. The results of Metzelaar's biographical work became apparent at a ceremony during the congress recogniz- ing the appearance of a volume she edited on the life and works of six Dutch women composers. The two papers on Saturday provided critiques of mainstream historiography. Austrian musicologist Regina Himmelbauer's "With- out a Picture the Mirror Breaks: The Use of Her Story" began with the historiographical concealment and distortion of the trobairitz, the female troubadour, and presented iconographic evidence of the tra- dition. By the end it offered more general conclusions: how a per- sonal standpoint (e.g., feminist, lesbian) is necessary in historical work; how the notion of the masterwork must yield to the concept of</page><page sequence="5">CONFERENCE REPORT the work of the moment, in performance; and how more attention needs to be paid to unwritten traditions. The last speaker, Elisabeth Bosland (University of Nijmegen), addressed "Gender In/And Musi- cology." In her general critique of the patriarchal nature of musico- logical inquiry, Bosland asserted that the most basic questions need to be framed in new ways. This echoes a general feminist theme of pioneers such as historian Gerda Lerner in the early 197os and mu- sicologists Jane Bowers and Judith Tick in the next decade (introduc- tion to Women Making Music, 1986). Bosland also underscored the importance of avoiding essentialist constructions of woman/women in history, especially in opposition to man/men, and, like Himmelbauer, emphasized consideration of the researcher's relationship with the material under study. In addition to the seven main speakers, there was a special intro- ductory lecture by Rosa Braidotti, professor of women's studies at the University of Utrecht, who analyzed Billie Holliday and Diana Ross in ways that emphasized the conference theme of "beyond biography." A group of brief presentations also figured on the program. While many were informational reports on women in music of a given coun- try, some speakers presented what amounted to short papers, such as 537 J. Michele Edwards on sonic possibilities in contemporary music by women or Kerstin Glathe on Canadian composer Violet Archer. A forum for extended professional conversation among the speakers occurred one afternoon with Joke Dame's improvised gathering for the benefit of her seminar students. As useful as this session turned out to be, an officially scheduled panel near the end, in front of all congress participants, would have been welcome and extremely ben- eficial. The lectures generally ran smoothly, thanks to Ellen Overweel and the other organizers. But a few problems arose. In the case of one speaker no questions were permitted, even though time remained at the conclusion of the session as a whole. A more general problem concerned the often cryptic introductions to the speakers and their topics. Furthermore, the room used for the lectures, while adequate in most respects, did not begin to compare to the rather wonderful spaces for the concerts. On the one hand, this reflected the relative emphases of the Congress. Yet on the other hand, speakers (like performers) received a visible sign of appreciation in a lovely bouquet of flowers after their presentation, and were generously provided for by the Congress in general. I have to comment on the wonderful live performances at the Congress. There was a wide range of media, from soloist to various chamber combinations to symphony orchestra to mechanical instru- ments. And the quality was uniformly high. Among my favorite</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY performers were mezzo-soprano Rachel Ann Morgan, pianist Ellen Corver, satsuma-biwa player Junko Ueda, the Dufy String Quartet, and a versatile group called Nieuw Ensemble. While Dutch composers were emphasized, there was great stylistic and historical range. Among those whose works I enjoyed were Henriette Bosmans, Anna Cramer (1873-1968), and Tera de Marez Oyens (b. 1932). Although I would have preferred a more even balance between papers and concerts, the Congress overall was a success. The intimate surroundings, plenary format, wonderful music, and geographical scope of attendees made this a highly enjoyable event. The official luncheon at the end served as a satisfying conclusion. But I was left to wonder about the appropriateness of the "Beyond Biography" label given the preponderance of performances. Live music, after all, is intrinsically "beyond biography," so there is little need to use such a title. Was the event originally conceived more as a traditional confer- ence and at some point changed? Was the phrase considered neces- sary or desirable as a means of publicizing the event or distinguishing it from the other congresses? Whatever the reasons, the Seventh In- ternational Congress on Women in Music provided a forum for some 538 excellent papers and an opportunity to meet colleagues from other countries, especially on the Continent, and share ideas beyond na- tional borders. In early July, only a few days after the end of the Minneapolis conference, many of us traveled to London for the third event, the Gender and Music Conference, held at King's College of the University of London. After the excitement at Minneapolis and the experience of two conferences it would have been difficult for any conference to sustain interest to the same degree. Although fewer than five of us attended all three, many more participated in the last two. For the "multiples" it suggested the line, "If it's Friday it must be London!" or perhaps an image of a traveling show that was pulling up stakes to perform at the next town. While this may not be the fairest context in which to report on the London conference, it nonetheless characterizes the summer of 1991 and probably affected perceptions of all three events. With over fifty speakers packed into three days, the format in London resembled Minneapolis much more than Utrecht, and con- sequently most presentations were fairly short. Speakers came from diverse countries, including Australia and New Zealand, but most were British, American, or Canadian. The scope was eclectic. Ap- proaches ranged from criticism to biography, and topics included the contemporary and historical composer, opera, performing groups and organizations, popular music, sexual orientation, new analytical</page><page sequence="7">CONFERENCE REPORT approaches, and music education. Organizer Nicola LeFanu sounded the theme of diversity in her opening remarks and observed that we all have a great deal to learn from each other. Susan McClary pro- vided a rich elaboration of this in "Striking the Fundamental Tone: The Celebration of Difference in Feminist Music Criticism," the ad- dress that had provided the "Keynote" in Minneapolis. As she ob- served, not only is multiplicity important for providing the kinds of tools needed to make real changes in how music is studied and un- derstood, but it is necessary in order to avoid a totalitarianism that could be appropriated by the New Right as a "politically correct" ideology. My presentation, "Gender and the Sonata Aesthetic," con- cluded the opening session. It discussed how the first movement of Cecile Chaminade's Piano Sonata might have challenged the gendered codes of sonata form, and it generated some provocative questions. The remainder of the review will of necessity be selective because of parallel sessions and the large number of presentations; my apol- ogies to those whom I do not mention. Two successive sessions on education occurred the first day. On the session devoted to British pedagogy, Hilary Bracefield discussed university composition teach- ing and the female student. Basing her ideas on completed question- 539 naires, Bracefield raised important questions about fundamental as- sumptions in the teaching of composition and suggested that possibilities of difference with respect to the way women learn, pro- cess, and create must be taken into account. Susan Borwick opened the second session with "Feminists and Musicians: Visionaries in the American Academy," a thoughtful presentation grounded in two fac- tors: Borwick's position as a departmental chairwoman, and the only one, in a small liberal arts university; and the fact that she is fre- quently the sole music participant in women's studies conferences. Through a helpful chart Borwick showed how music and feminism represent outsiders in the academy. Thus feminist musicians function as "doubled others." Ultimately Borwick left it to the audience to decide whether feminist musicians should back away from leadership roles or whether they should step forward. Afterwards, James Briscoe spoke on the placing of historical women in the mainstream of tradi- tional music history courses, and Karin Pendle discussed modelings for studying women and their own traditions. In other papers that day, Derek Scott addressed "Sexuality and Musical Style from Mon- teverdi to Mae West." In final remarks he spoke of real or reflected sexuality in songs and how each is capable of subverting conventions of sexuality. Geraldine Finn, in "Music, Mozart, and Men" (also de- livered in Minneapolis), explored the important issue of why a certain composer, at a certain time and in a certain place, becomes a cultural icon to the extent of Mozart in 1991. In so doing Finn emphasized</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY music's power in the social fabric. Steve Turner's "The Gendered Cadence: Music and Its Other (Against Anthropomorphism in Mu- sic)" focused on an important music construct. Perhaps this theoret- ically concentrated paper required a written format to ensure time for extended study. Joke Dame, in "Voices Within the Voice: Geno- and Phenotext in Sequenza III' (also in Minneapolis), presented another exploration of cultural meanings of the voice, but this time focused on a particular piece/rendition, Cathy Berberian's interpretation of Be- rio's challenging composition. In a multi-layered reading Dame ques- tioned Istvan Anhalt's assertion that this performance represents mental pathology, and utilized Barthes's constructions of geno- and phenotext, originally from Julia Kristeva, to reconceptualize its mean- ings. For Dame, Berberian is more the composer than Berio. Fur- thermore, there is some insanity in the work, but rather than pathol- ogy it represents something that is part of everyone and therefore "normal." Saturday brought two interesting presentations on the music of Hildegard of Bingen. Composer Pozzi Escot drew mathematical com- parisons with the music of Ligeti, while Robert Cogan analyzed the 540 repeating cell-like patterns of her music in terms of fractals. After Sylvia Glickman's lecture-demonstration "Three Centuries of Piano Music by Women Composers," John Shepherd explored some of the theoretical nuances of problems in the relationship between music and subjectivity. While an important discussion of important critical theory, the paper made only passing reference to gender per se. Ana- hid Kassabian explored the seemingly clear gender associations in title themes for television and film. Early in the afternoon, a session de- voted to popular music featured Mavis Bayton's paper "How Women Become Rock Musicians" and a general panel discussion. Three other afternoon sessions focused on women as composers/ musicians in particular countries. Margaret Lucy Wilkins and Rosie Chambers each spoke on aspects of composers in Britain (Chambers also discussed Irish composers). While Helen Metzelaar gave a pre- sentation on the history of women composers in Holland, Rosalie Lamburn spoke on the advancement of professional women musi- cians in Turkey, Veronica Doubleday on women musicians in Af- ghanistan, and Claire Polin on the role of the woman composer in Russia and the Soviet Union (delivered by Jan Hamer). I found two of the papers on national characteristics particularly interesting. Eliza- beth Kerr, in "Women Composers in New Zealand: An Ancient Cul- ture in a Young Country," favored an ethnomusicological approach as she focused on the intersection of Maori and non-Maori traditions with respect to women composers. Cultural appropriation figured as a central theme. Kerr provided recorded examples from a Maori</page><page sequence="9">CONFERENCE REPORT "contrafactum" (my term) of Gershwin's "Love Walked In" (very hu- morous to American ears), and from Janey McCloud's "Earth and Sky" (1968) and Helen Fischer's "Peace." A New Zealander herself, Kerr's cultural sensitivity prompted her comment that this conference is mostly white and female. I also enjoyed Sally Macarthur's "Ripping the Beard Off Analysis: Writing Moya Henderson and Gillian White- head into the Discourse." Here Macarthur took the music of two prominent Australian composers and showed how musical analysis is patriarchal in terms of what is analyzed and how it is analyzed. Like Rieger (in Utrecht), Macarthur rejected the notion of an essentialist female aesthetic but recognized the possibility of tendencies. Other presentations that afternoon centered on Daria Semegen (Elizabeth Hinkle-Turner) and Pauline Oliveros (Heidi von Gunden), and there was a panel discussion on contemporary women composers. The final day offered two of the best sessions of the conference. Philip Brett began the session on sexuality with his fine presentation, "Musicality, Essentialism, and the Closet." The terms homosexuality and musicality, both introduced in the nineteenth century, have con- noted deviancy, and there has been a natural connection between the two. As Brett observed, one "code" question for a homosexual is "Is 541 he ... musical?" Brett provided new perspective on the social contract entered into by musicians, and why "gay people in music have been so reluctant to reveal themselves and why they have been slower than feminists to find a distinctive voice to add to the discourse of musical scholarship and criticism" (Brett's abstract). Elizabeth Wood shifted the focus to women. In "Sapphonics: Desire in a Different Voice," Wood explored interrelationships among sexuality, gender, and de- sire in particular voice-types. Concentrating on the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, Wood discussed the pushed-up mezzo range, which she termed Sapphonic (e.g. in Olive Fremstad or Mary Garden), and brought composer Ethel Smyth centrally into the anal- ysis. Suzanne Raitt's presentation, the last on the session, centered on the sexual implications of three extraordinary depictions of women musicians by artist John Singer Sargent. These included the famous drawing of Smyth, a full-length oil of singer Elsie Swinton, and a half-portrait of singer Mabel Batten in a striking pose of erotic aban- donment in the midst of singing. Raitt's uniting of sexuality with music and iconography suggests an attractive area for future feminist explorations. The other notable session consisted of two presentations devoted to American music of the early twentieth century. Judith Tick's paper, read by Wood, proposed the model of a straddler for Ruth Crawford Seeger's position vis a vis family and work, which Tick sees more as twins than opposites. In this rich narrative the Violin Sonata (1926) was treated as a key work in Seeger's relationship to</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY sexuality, gender, and modernist music. Catherine Smith's "Feminism and Modernism in American Music," based on the work of literary critics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, argued that anti-woman at- titudes of the early-twentieth century played a role in establishing a musical style and aesthetic-namely modernism-that acted to ex- clude women or silence them completely. In other presentations on Sunday, three papers addressed aspects of women's relationship with the orchestra. While Margaret Myers focused on Sweden, J. Michele Edwards discussed issues of gender within the American orchestra, including the conductor as an "imago of power," the importance of women's visibility in the orchestra, im- plications of the orchestra's position at the top of the performing hierarchy, and the impact of all-women orchestras. Odaline de la Martinez, concentrating on the UK, asserted that the power hierarchy within the orchestra is based on a business model and that this has worked to the detriment of women. Several papers centered on spe- cific composers. Annie Janeiro Randall utilized a traditional musico- logical approach in her exploration of eighteenth-century composer Corona Schr6ter and the circumstances surrounding her autobiogra- 542 phy. British composers were featured in presentations by Jory Ben- nett, Sophie Fuller, and Nicola Losseff. Earlier in the day, Peter Franklin and George Biddlecombe spoke on opera. And Dorothy de Val, Anne MacNeil, and Susan Cerasano explored certain historical performing traditions and their relationship with women. Performing as live experience occurred in the many concerts dis- persed throughout the conference. There were two to three each day, at various times, often set opposite paper sessions. Of the daytime events I was impressed with the historical recital by Laurel Goetz- inger, soprano, and Anna Briscoe, piano. Consisting of repertoire from the mid-sixteenth century (Anne Boleyn) to the present, from diverse countries, the recital focused on song but occasionally fea- tured pianist Briscoe alone, as in her fine renditions of music by Amy Beach and Grazyna Bacewicz. The talented chamber group Sounds Positive presented the music of several contemporary British compos- ers, including Judith Weir, Rhian Samuel, Janet Graham, Enid Luff, and Julia Usher. LeFanu's "Lullaby" was particularly moving, as was a related piece of hers, "Nocturne," performed the night before. On Saturday evening, as part of a special dinner, jazz singer Sandi Russell offered a powerful dramatic narrative in music and speech, "Render Me My Song," which told of the female African-American experience. The title comes from her book of the same name. The conference took place in various rooms at King's College on the Strand. While some spaces served better than others, there were</page><page sequence="11">CONFERENCE REPORT a few problems, some associated with the unusually hot weather dur- ing the conference. In addition, apparatus needed for speaking, in- cluding lectern and microphone, was often absent. But this confer- ence had very little funding and was apparently run on a shoestring. Considering the sheer scope of the event and the fact that it was mainly volunteers, especially Sophie Fuller, who had the enormous task of organizing the event, the conference went quite well. As a whole it was less sophisticated and innovative than Minneapolis, but this was probably not its purpose. For as the first such conference in Britain it aimed for breadth and diversity, and in this it was successful. From the point of view of an American, the strong British emphasis meant the opportunity to make new contacts and to find out what is of interest in the mother country. For the British and others, the significant American presence allowed a glimpse into the diverse ap- proaches to gender, feminism, and gay and lesbian studies now un- derway in the US. In all these respects this was an important confer- ence. What are we left with from the events of this sum- mer? While musicologists in the United States have led the way in the 4 areas of women, gender, and sexuality, exciting work is also taking place in other countries. For both sides of the Atlantic it will be crucial to maintain ties, and this means informal communication as well as more structured channels. While American scholars enjoy the benefits of a critical mass of colleagues with whom to share ideas and infor- mation, scholars in other countries, especially small countries like Holland, may be working in relative isolation. This results not only from a very small number of colleagues interested in the area but also from a serious problem in the distribution of publications on the international level. Thus countries on the Continent are not in the pipeline for English-language materials, while the Anglo-American sector is hard-pressed to find out about materials in other languages. Scholars in other countries also noted the difficulty of bibliographic access to American periodicals and the fact that their countries, in- cluding England, may not be purchasing many basic American pub- lications. But on the positive side, the exchange of ideas and the stimulation from so many different approaches to gender and sexu- ality at these conferences have forged a sense of an international community, and one that is committed to staying in touch. Confer- ences are going to occur more regularly-plans are afoot for 1992, 1993, and 1994. If the three events of 1991 are any indication, the future promises a proliferation of imaginative work on women. Rice University</page></plain_text>
