<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW ACCESSIONS IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ART Jade was a stone greatly valued by the Maya, used as a mark of rank by their ruling hierarchy as well as by people in neigh boring Mexican areas. Slightly different in chemical make-up from Oriental jade and often called jadeite, it can nevertheless be included within the generic term jade. Thought of as a precious material, it was worked laboriously with drills of bone or hard stone, as, of course, these civilizations had not reached the Iron Age and metal tools were unknown. A magnificent example' of the craft, an imperial jade pendant of brilliant emerald green, was given in 1947 by Mrs. R. Henry Norweb in memory of her aunt, Delia Holden White. A human head is held in the jaws of an animal and if the piece is turned, another animal head appears. It came from Copan, a site in the highlands of Honduras, and is, therefore, representative of the early Mayan period. A comparison of it with examples published in Kelemen, Medieval American Art,2 and in other sources, ranks it with the most refined and exquisite pieces known. The illustration shows the strong profile, with its typical sloping forehead, curving beak-like nose, and characteristic mouth. The other gifts illustrated in this Bulletin are all of gold and come from two areas, Cocle in Panama, and the region of Antioquia in the Upper Cauca Valley in Colombia, which was the habitat of the Quimbaya Indians. Cocl6, which is a province in the Republic of Panama, borders the Gulf of Panama on the western side of the Isthmus, at the point where it is narrow. Here, in this general region, Balboa discovered the Pacific Ocean. Records indicate the richness of 1 No. 47.176. Height 3"; width I7s".

Excavations by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University, published by Samuel Kirkland Lothrop3 in I937, have brought to light numerous burials which show not only objects whose origin can be localized in this area, but also objects imported from Colombia and elsewhere. Two fine anthropomorphic figures in gold from this region of Cocle were given in 1946, one4 by Mrs. Benjamin P. Bole, the other5 by Miss Helen Humphreys in memory of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Humphreys. They have the fine casting for which this area was particularly noted. In some cases the Cocle craftsmen used open molds, as in the new accessions, although their usual technique was the closed mold used in the cire perdue process. Cast filigree work of great delicacy is found, achieved by modeling with wax threads. Both pieces show this technique, which is carried to a most decorative success in the Bole gift. The figures have animal heads, and the Humphreys piece has bat-like wings and pendants of highly ornamental effect. Three other gifts,6 from Colombia, were all given in memory of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Humphreys by their daughter, Miss Helen Humphreys. They represent at their best the casting and rare artistic ability of the Quimbaya Indians. The gold is in a rather pure form, or alloyed with copper, the color varying with the alloy, which gives a brilliant color effect to the broad polished surfaces that are characteristic. Coiled wire and braid ed motifs often appear, and the subject material is a world where abstract motifs blend with animal and human forms. The final piece7 illustrated was given by Mrs. A. S. Ingalls. It is a most important fragmentary piece, gold plated, in which two fantastic animals and many smaller animal heads are entwined in an abstract pattern. It has many of the Quimbaya characteristics enumerated above, but it is possible it might be Sinu, another area in Colombia, where the mainland joins the Isthmus. 3 Vol. VII, Pt.
