Each community exhibited a unique and substantial profile of such variants, far exceeding cultural variation reported before for any other non-human species. Evaluation of these pan-African distributions against three models for the diffusion of traditions identified multiple cases consistent with cultural evolution involving differentiation in form, function and targets of behaviour patterns. Introduction Research on animal culture and social learning has been conducted inter- mittently all through the twentieth century (Whiten &amp; Ham, 1992; McGrew, 1998), but has accelerated in recent years. The accumulating results of this theoretical and empirical work are represented in a profusion of reviews, reappraisals and collections of papers in the last decade (Galef, 1990, 1992, 1998; Tomasello, 1990, 1994, 1996; Visalberghi &amp; Fragaszy, 1990, in press; McGrew, 1992, 1998; Moore, 1992; Whiten &amp; Ham, 1992; Heyes, 1993; Quiatt &amp; Reynolds, 1993; Tomasello et al., 1993; King, 1994; Thierry, 1994; Wrangham et al., 1994b; Boesch, 1996a, b; Heyes &amp; Galef, 1996; Parker &amp; Russon, 1996; Sperber, 1996; Zentall, 1996, 2001; Russon, 1997; Tomasello &amp; Call, 1997; Boesch &amp; Tomasello, 1998; Byrne &amp; Russon, 1998; Russon et al., 1998; Box &amp; Gibson, 1999; Miklosi, 1999; Aunger, 2000; Whiten, 2000; Myowa-Yamakoshi, 2001; Rendell &amp; Whitehead, 2001; Fragaszy &amp; Perry, in press; Meltzoff &amp; Prinz, in press). Much of the recent work has concerned transmission processes such as imitation, most often studied in minimal, dyadic configurations (what does individual A learn from observing individual B?). Although these social learning processes have typically been studied because of their putative role in the transmission of behavioural traditions, relatively few studies have sought to chart cultural variation itself, in wild populations. Amongst primates, for example, such studies are largely restricted to just two taxa; the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) (McGrew, 1998; Whiten, 2000). The evidence that does exist derives from studies that have typically fo- cused on only a single type of behaviour that varies between populations. Birdsong dialects represent perhaps the most comprehensively documented example (Marler &amp; Tamura, 1964; see Catchpole &amp; Slater, 1995, for a re- view). Although inter-populational song variation has been well-documented</page><page sequence="3">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1483 for some species, and complemented by experimental, laboratory studies es- tablishing the kind of social learning process at work, we still do not know the extent to which variations in other patterns of behaviour, such as forag- ing and courtship patterns, map onto the dialect-groups. Whether such mul- tiple cultural variations exist, and if so, what mechanisms underlie them, are important question for at least two reasons. One is that however much we would wish to eschew anthropomorphism in the study of animal behaviour, the phenomenon of culture is best known in our own species, thus inevitably providing patterns against which putative animal cultures can be compared. Since it is a matter of common observation that any two human cultures vary in multiple ways (eating habits, courtship rituals, forms of greeting etc.), the extent to which this is true of other species is an inescapable question of in- terest. In the present paper we present what may be the richest patterns of such variation documented in a non-human species to date. A second reason to analyse multiple traditions appeals to the very much broader goal of understanding the nature of cultural processes in biologi- cal systems, including, eventually, their interaction with genetically-based processes of behavioural evolution (Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Feldman &amp; Laland, 1996). One important empirical step towards this lies in analysing the spatial patterning of multiple cultural variations. In the present paper we assess whether the observed patternings of putative cultural variations amongst chimpanzees are consistent with specific alternative models of the diffusion process. Models of cultural processes As a first step in this enterprise we consider just three basic cultural models (Fig. 1). In the first, Diffusion from Unitary Origin (Fig. la), a single behavioural innovation originates in one community (or 'unit-group') and the behaviour then spreads (diffuses) outwards to other communities through social learning (probably in turn resting upon cross-community migration). A putative cultural behaviour found to be both widespread in, and restricted to, a population that includes multiple communities within one geographic region, would be consistent with this model. The second model involves Diffusion from Multiple Origins (Fig. lb), a scenario that would be predicted to occur for types of behaviour that are easier for the species to invent than in the case of a unitary origin. This model would be supported by</page><page sequence="4">1484 WHITEN ET AL. a b .9~ .9 45~~~4 II Fig. 1. Three models of cultural diffusion, illustrated in relation to hypothetical chimpanzee study sites/communities A-F. (a) Diffusion of a behaviour pattern (shading) from a unitary origin (community B) to neighbouring populations including communities A, C, D; (b) Diffu- sion from multiple initial sources (B, E) to neighbouring communities; (c) Diffusion together with differentiation, creating variants. On the left a qualitative differentiation occurs as a be- haviour pattern diffuses from B to C, and another as it passes from B to D. On the right, the possibility of more graded differentiation (e.g. in aspects of action intensity or tool dimen- sions) is recognised in diffusion of a behaviour pattern from F to others, including E.</page><page sequence="5">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1485 finding two or more separate regional distributions for the behaviour in question, each indicating diffusion from a different original source. Third, is Diffusion with Differentiation (Fig. ic), in which the behaviour is modified in some significant way during its spread (although its 'lineage' remains sufficiently identifiable). As we shall see, the change might be in the form of the behaviour, its functions or its targets. Boesch &amp; Tomasello (1998, p. 602) envisaged such a process as the 'branching' of a tradition. Evidence consistent with this third model would be behavioural patterns in adjacent sub-populations that represent variants on a theme common to the larger region in which they are found, or variants of behaviour found in neighbouring sub-populations. Of course, this would mean that a behavioural distribution might be correctly considered as consistent with model 1 (or 2, if the relevant conditions are met) so long as the behaviour category is described at a relatively global or inclusive level, but as consistent with model 3 once differentiated subcategories are distinguished. In the words of Boyd et al. (1997), we might in this case witness hierarchically structured spatial patterns of behavioural distribution. In the present paper we begin to evaluate distributions of chimpanzee behavioural variation against the predictions of these models. These distinctions concern each category of behaviour considered sepa- rately. As Boyd et al. (1997) also noted in surveying the fundamental ques- tions of cultural analysis, a higher-level issue concerns whether variations in certain behaviours might cluster or covary with others, suggesting an un- derlying linkage. Boyd et al. added that any one community might also be differentiated from others by a distinctive suite of variations, which in the human case has sometimes been suggested to reflect a relatively resilient cultural 'core' of the community concerned. Multiple behavioural variations are sufficiently complex in chimpanzees that we can begin to address these higher-level issues also. Charting cultural variation in chimpanzees Chimpanzees have for some time been in the vanguard of non-human species for which such issues might be addressed. Attempts to chart multiple cultural variations have become more elaborate as data from long-term field studies have accumulated (Goodall, 1973, 1986; McGrew et al., 1979; Baldwin et al., 1981; Nishida et al., 1983; McGrew, 1992; Wrangham et al., 1994a; Boesch, 1996a; McGrew &amp; Marchant, 1997; Boesch &amp; Tomasello, 1998).</page><page sequence="6">1486 WHITEN ET AL. However, to achieve the most definitive analysis we took an approach dif- ferent to these earlier analyses, which were based upon published records from field studies. Relying on published data poses at least three problems in arriving at an accurate picture. One is that the literature is incomplete; field- workers may steadily accumulate records of the repertoire of behaviour at their sites, but there is always a backlog of unpublished findings, sometimes substantial (field researchers naturally vary in what they consider to have high priority for publication). Secondly, even when records are published, it is not necessarily a priority of the author to describe how common in the community is the behaviour in question; yet for cultural analysis it is vital to know where a behaviour lies on the continuum from unique, or anecdotal, to customary. Thirdly, to identify cultural variation it is vital to know which behaviour patterns, common at some sites, remain absent at others; yet such 'negative' data will naturally tend to be under-reported. We instead approached the problem through a systematic survey, first defining a set of candidate cultural variants, then having the key researchers at each of nine major field sites classify the level of occurrence recorded for the communities of chimpanzee studied. The method is described fully further below. A brief account of the behavioural distributions identified in this study has been published for the seven most long-term sites (Whiten et al., 1999). In the present, companion paper we offer a comprehensive report of the information collated in our collaborative study, including the data for all nine sites. The resulting charts of cultural variation are by far the most extensive for any species but our own, encouraging us to begin to explore their fit to the alternative models of cultural processes outlined above. We note that despite an impressive set of pioneering explorations (e.g. Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Durham, 1991), Richerson &amp; Boyd (1997, p. 342) were led to lament that 'to date, the use of Darwinian ideas to study cultural evolution has been mostly a conceptual and theoretical exercise'. Our data set is perhaps the first to permit an empirical investigation of substantial cultural patterning in any non-human species. Methods Communities studied Nine communities that have been the subject of long-term fieldwork were assessed (Fig. 2).

All field studies continue at these sites except for Mahale-K (terminated 1983) but we restrict the present analysis to the data we collated up to the end of 1998. The study proceeded in two phases Phase 1 The aim of Phase I was to generate a list of candidate cultural variations for input to a second phase in which occurrence at each site would be systematically established. Phase 1 was thus intended to be inclusive, logging any candidate behavioural pattern that we suspected might lead to the identification of cultural variants in Phase 2. Over-inclusion of inappropriate candidates in Phase 1 was expected to be unproblematic insofar as these would be weeded out in Phase 2. Directors of nine long-term chimpanzee field studies (the coauthors of this paper; see Table 1) received an initial list of defined behaviour patterns drawn up by A.W. and C.B. on the basis of existing published material. Together with their key co-workers, directors were asked to name and define any further behavioural patterns they suspected might vary culturally across sites. On this basis a new, extended list was drawn up and circulated to all collaborators to check for clarity and negotiate issues of lumping or splitting of behavioural categories.</page><page sequence="8">1488 WHITEN ET AL. Collaborators found it relatively easy to achieve a consensus on the latter, although it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to establish objective rules for deciding such matters. For example, it was agreed to lump 'dip a stick in a bee's nest to get honey', and 'dip a stick in a hole to get water', as 'fluid dip', because the action patterns appear so similar. In principle, the two categories could have been kept separate (one can always split a category into the different ways of doing it, or alternatively, lump categories together that share a common feature). Thus, the precise number of cultural variants we eventually came to identify should not be over-reified; it is a number dependent on the outcome of the process common to all ethology, of splitting or lumping categories of behaviour in a way appropriate to the study in hand. Objectivity in this aim was pursued in the present study through the systematic procedures specified by Phases 1 and 2, with Phase 1 requiring agreement between highly experienced chimpanzee researchers on what they regard as a usefully discriminable set of candidate behaviour patterns in the first place. It is likely that further insights will be gained in future through more refined and comprehensive versions of our procedure, of which the present study is merely a first, and exploratory, application. Phase 1 generated a list of 65 fully defined behaviour patterns (Table 1). Appropriate references are included in Table 1 where the behaviour has been described well in existing literature. Particularly with regard to any future attempts to apply our approach to other species, it cannot be emphasised too strongly how important for Phase 2 we found these full, written definitions. Indeed, once directors proceeded to further discussion with their team in Phase 2, it became necessary to specify some definitions even more closely before the frequency of the behaviour could be properly coded by the respective field researchers. Phase 2 In consultation with their key collaborators, the field-site directors assigned a code appro- priate for the chimpanzee community they studied to each of the 65 candidate behavioural patterns, as follows: * Customary - pattern occurs in all or most able-bodied members of at least one age-sex class (e.g. adult males). * Habitual - pattern is not customary but has been seen repeatedly in several individuals, consistent with some degree of social transmission. * Present - pattern is clearly identified but neither customary nor habitual. * Absent - pattern is not recorded and no ecological explanation for absence is apparent. * Ecological explanation - absence of pattern is explicable because of a local environ- mental or ecological constraint. * Unknown - pattern is not recorded, but we cannot be sure of absence because of inadequacy of relevant observational opportunities. As might be expected, the distinction that respondents on occasion found difficult to make was whether a pattern absent at any particular site could be ascribed to an ecological explanation or not. In most cases the answer appeared clear. For example, 'ecological explanation' for absence could be confidently coded when a species of tree essential to the act was known to be unavailable; conversely, 'absent' could be coded when such a tree species was present yet no sign of the behaviour pattern had ever been seen. In other cases the decision was more difficult, an issue we return to in the discussion section.

Returns were collated and tabulated (Tables 2 and 3). We note that chimpanzees have been studied for different periods of time at each site. Two devices were used to ensure that the codings across sites were comparably reliable. First, the 'unknown' code gave researchers the option of recording when a reliable judgement could not yet be made about a specific behaviour pattern at their site. In the event, as is evident in Tables 2 and 3, use of this code divided the sample into two quite different groups. In one fall</page><page sequence="13">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1493 two sites where the 'unknown' code had to be applied extensively; these are Assirik, where study had to be halted after four years of intensive work, and Lope, where research priorities did not include intensive chimpanzee habituation. The codings for such sites are nevertheless important overall, because they include valuable records ranging from 'customary' to 'absent' for the more ostentatious behaviour patterns (including those leaving obvious material traces, such as certain forms of tool use) that will quickly be apparent to observers if they are being performed. Such codings, in conjunction with those from other sites, can be used to identify cultural variants at least for the behaviour patterns concerned. For the other seven sites, all studied intensively for eight years or more, the unknown code was rarely used. This gives a good indication of the scale of study ideally required for the kind of analysis we offer here. The second device we used in recognising observational limitations was the query code. As indicated above, the principal cause of the (still relatively infrequent) use of this code (see tables) was a difficulty in being confident that an ecological explanation for absence could be discounted. These safeguards have been implemented with the intention of making it unlikely that 'absent' is prematurely coded. Note also that even if the latter error were made, it is unlikely that a behaviour pattern that was truly habitual or customary (as opposed to merely present) would have been recorded as absent; yet re-classification of putative cultural variants (shifting them from Table 3 to 2: see Results) would be necessitated only if correction on this scale became necessary. The bias in our procedures instead leans to conservatism in the number of variants identified. Given that identification of cultural variants rests on contrasts we identify in this paper between (minimally) any two sites (customary/habitual at one, absent at another), it is logically more likely that those behaviour categories which have so far not been coded as differing between sites in this way (Table 2) may come to be so as further observation permits confident codings to be made. Respondents were finally invited to add to their formal questionnaire returns supplemen- tary comments about the nature of each behavioural pattern at their site. Certain of these comments provided useful and unexpected information reported in the results section below, but clearly the unsystematic nature of this component of the study constrains the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn, in contrast with the formal collation exercise. Results and discussion 1. Identifying cultural variants We identified as putative cultural variants those behavioural patterns that are absent without ecological explanation in at least one community, yet achieve habitual or customary status in at least one other (Table 3). Behavioural patterns fail to meet this criterion for three different kinds of reason and we consider these patterns first (Table 2). In category A fell seven behavioural patterns that were not recorded as 'absent without ecological explanation' at any site, and thus cannot be classed as cultural variants by our criteria. Instead, these patterns are better</page><page sequence="14">1494 WHITEN ET AL. TABLE 2.

Discovering these patterns at this stage of our analysis reflects our rule to lean towards being over-inclusive in Phase 1, given it would be followed by the 'sieving' function of Phase 2. In fact this vindicates the two-phase approach, because before we conducted this analysis, there was simply no way of knowing that a pattern like leaf- sponging is a chimpanzee 'universal' rather than a cultural variant. Of course, this does not mean such behaviours are not culturally acquired by a</page><page sequence="15">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1495 TABLE 3.

Nevertheless, behavioural patterns in category A do not offer circumstantial evidence for cultural variation in the way that those in Table 3 do. A further 16 patterns of behaviour that failed to exhibit habitual or customary status in any community made up Category B. These 'rarities' cannot count as cultural variants since nowhere do they achieve a frequency consistent with being socially transmitted. The pattems in this category provide a different vindication of the two-phase approach; without it, there was no way to know whether some of the behavioural patterns might somewhere have achieved the cultural status mooted for them in Phase 1. Category C contains just three behavioural patterns that reach at least habitual status in one community (including 'ground-night-nest', known to be habitual at Nimba, a relatively new site not yet appropriate for full inclusion in our survey; Matsuzawa &amp; Yamakoshi, 1996) and are absent elsewhere, yet these absences were all explicable by local ecological factors. For example, where 'algae fishing' was absent, there appeared to be either no opportunity (no algae) or no need for it (available without need of fishing). That only three such behaviour patterns needed to be excluded in this way may on first sight appear surprising. However, it must be remembered that the initial list of candidate cultural variants generated in Phase 1 began with proposals from experienced field researchers, who likely filtered from their potential suggestions those judged certain to fail on this criterion. No less than 39 behavioural patterns remain that meet our criteria for cultural variants, being absent in at least one community and habitual or customary in at least one other (Table 3). This central finding of the survey is remarkable in two ways. First, as will be apparent from the brief review introducing this paper, this number far exceeds that known to date for any species except our own. Second, inspection of Table 3 shows that each community has its own unique suite of cultural (i.e. habitual or customary) behavioural patterns. We discuss these findings further in the concluding section of the paper. 2. The fit with alternative cultural models The richness of the patterns charted in Table 3 encourages us to begin to examine their fit to the models of cultural processes outlined in the introduc- tion. Dispersal over distances up to about 900 km is detectable in maternally</page><page sequence="17">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1497 transmitted chimpanzee genotypes (Morin et al., 1994), underlining the po- tential for cultural diffusion over even larger distances. Accordingly, we have to entertain the possibility that the behaviour patterns of interest here may have achieved their present distributions across Africa by cultural diffusion between the populations that exhibit them. A. Consistency with diffusion from unitary versus multiple origins Some behavioural patterns were found to achieve customary or habitual status in more than one community. These distributions are drawn together in Table 4, for clarity, in order to examine whether they are consistent with diffusion from unitary or multiple origins. If there were a common origin, the habitual and customary cases for behavioural pattern of interest should tend to occur in the communities that are closest together; they should tend not to be separated by communities in which the pattern is absent. To facilitate inspecting the distributions in this respect, in Tables 2-4 the three West African sites are in the first three, adjacent columns; the one Central African TABLE 4.

Of course, a gap could correspond not to the absence of diffusion, but to diffusion followed by localised loss of the pattern from the repertoire. We interpret cases where patterns are widely and continuously distributed with only a single gap as the most likely to be consistent with this latter scenario. Conversely, regional occurrences separated by several records of absence are more consistent with multiple regional origins. Table 4 has been constructed to illustrate such continuities and disconti- nuities. First are shown 11 behavioural patterns for which any habitual or customary occurrences together form a continuous distribution, consistent with cultural diffusion from a unitary origin. Only two point strongly to such a unitary origin, however. The first is 'nut-hammer', found at two adjacent West African sites (and also known to occur elsewhere in West Africa: Mc- Grew, 1992; Joulian 1996), but at none of the other sites examined here. Boesch et al. (1994) showed that nut-hammer is not found in an area inhab- ited by P. t. verus to the west of the large Sassandra river in Cote d'Ivoire. As noted by McGrew (1992), nut-hammering is perhaps the best supported case for cultural diffusion of a behaviour pattern amongst chimpanzees, starting from a unitary source and extending to a quite large yet circumscribed region of West Africa. 'Leaf-groom' is confined to East Africa and is widespread there, highly consistent with a unitary origin, mirroring the case for nut-hammering in the West. But the other eight cases are less clear. Use of 'leaf-napkin', for example, shows a continuous customary distribution at one pole of the Eastern sites, yet has also been observed in the West, perhaps reflecting a potential for multiple origins. 'Knuckle-knock' occurs customarily at some locations in both east and west, with no evidence of absence between them. Since these populations were once continuous with each other it is possible that such a behavioural distribution reflects ancient and far-reaching diffusion from a single source. However this inference is weakened by the observation that the pattern is absent in communities that are much closer geographically than those that share it. The same can be said of the other six behavioral patterns with continuous distributions ('leaf-strip' to 'aimed throw' in Table 4), for although these occur habitually in two to five communities in East Africa and are thus consistent with diffusion from a</page><page sequence="19">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1499 unitary source, they also occur in some communities in the west, in six cases reaching habitual or customary levels. The next two behaviour patterns, 'hand-clasp grooming' and 'leaf-clip with mouth', show widespread, continuous distributions but for a single, well-documented gap in their midst (Gombe, in both cases). As noted above, the most parsimonious explanation for such a distribution is diffusion from a unitary source, followed by loss of the behaviour in a single community. Such a scenario is given plausibility insofar as functional alternatives at Gombe exist that might reduce the intrinsic value of such customs; branch- clasp grooming (an apparent 'universal' - Table 2) as an alternative to hand-clasp grooming, and branch-shaking as an alternative to leaf-clipping to attract attention. The remaining eleven distributions in Table 4 are more obviously discon- tinuous and consistent with multiple origins. Four of these ('food pound' to 'lever open'), are common at Gombe and Tai, in one case at Bossou too. Al- though this could in principle reflect a much earlier diffusion from a unitary source, this seems unlikely given the overall spatial pattern. We suggest it is more plausible that the distribution results from multiple, independent in- novations of relatively simple behavioural patterns - food pound, club, and lever. It would not be surprising if these had been invented more than once by wild chimpanzees, especially since the communities concerned, Gombe and Tai, possess a rich repertoire of other forms of tool use. Of the last four patterns in the table, two occur in three quite separate communities. All four behavioural patterns are attention-getting acts used particularly by males during courtship; they appear to be the most capricious in their occurrence, although each achieves customary frequencies in at least one community. Unlike tool use that is constrained by its fit to external requirements, these social gestures may be more labile, expressing local innovations on the basic tendency to use vegetation for attracting others' attention. To be more speculative, it could be that such acts express local fashions (recurring in many communities from time to time), with males expressing their fitness by their ability to track them. Miller (2000) suggested that various aspects of human courtship may act as sexually-selected displays of intelligence; in an intelligent non-human species a similar if less extreme process might operate. This speculation leads to the testable prediction that these behaviour patterns will be found to be socially transmitted, yet changeable, over relatively short periods (i.e. fashions). A parellel is possible</page><page sequence="20">1500 WHITEN ET AL. here with recently reported changes in humpback whale songs thought to function as sexual displays, which showed a rapid acquisition of the forms introduced by a small number of immigrant males (Noad et al., 2000). B. Consistency with diffusion plus differentiation Results consistent with differentiation come from two sources: first, the sys- tematic questionnaire returns; and second, from the supplementary informa- tion submitted. The questionnaire information is quite circumscribed, per- haps because our focus was on defining discrete behavioural patterns and charting their distribution. Nevertheless, the two sources together suggest that differentiation may be a more pervasive phenomenon than expected, meriting more formal investigation in future phases of this project. (i) Questionnaire data: Table 5 brings together data for three kinds of case relevant to this question. The first includes behavioural patterns for dealing with ectoparasites, each of which occurs in one specific community, and also the category 'leaf-groom'. These show a hierarchical distribution consistent with a differentiation model. 'Index-hit', the technique found at Tai in West Africa, does not incorporate leaves. The two other methods, 'leaf-squash' at Gombe and 'leaf-inspect' at Budongo, do incorporate leaves; moreover, they (particularly leaf-squash) utilise actions quite like those involved in leaf-grooming, a behavioural pattern that occurs at all East African but no western sites. Parsimonious explanations for this pattern of distribution are that either (a) the three eastern leaf-using patterns are derived from the same ancestral pattern, or (b) leaf-squash and leaf-inspect are divergent techniques derived from the leaf-grooming behaviour that still occurs throughout their range (Fig. 3).

An example consistenlt with a differentiation model: distribution of three techniques (shown schematically) for dealing with ectoparasites. The occuffence of 'leaf inspect' at Budongo and 'leaf squash' at Gombe is consistent with either (a) differentiation from 'leaf groom', that occurs throughout their range; or (b) differentation of all three of these leaf-using patterns from a common origin. At TaY in the west, an index finger is used instead of leaves. Table 5 also shows that 'Leaf-clip with fingers' occurs at least habitually in only three of the six communities that habitually show 'leaf-clip with mouth'. This hierarchical nesting of the distributions suggest that the less frequent variation has been derived from the more common one. Finally, 'ant-dip-single' is habitual or customary in two West African populations but not elsewhere. At Gombe the more complex technique of 'ant-dip-wipe' is customary, and at Assirik is suspected to be so on the basis of recovered tools (McGrew et al., unpubl. data). In this method, a longer stick is used together with a deft bimanual wiping action that is much more productive than the simple method used at Tai (McGrew, 1974; Boesch, 1996a). It seems likely that the complex Gombe (and perhaps Assirik) method differentiated from earlier application of the simpler kind of technique, rather than being generated in one step. These cases (Table 5) illustrate three different kinds of differentiation: change in form and function (leaf-groom to leaf-squash and inspect), shift in bodily use (clip with mouth versus fingers) and elaboration in tool technique (simple dip to complex dip). Of course, it is possible that other forms of tool use reflect differentiation, but that the relevant 'lineage' is simply lost in the past. One might expect this effect in types of tool use sharing a core functional element, such as 'pound- ing', but 'pounding-like' behaviours including hammer-nut, food-pound and</page><page sequence="22">1502 WHITEN ET AL. pestle-pound do not appear to evidence the hierarchical distributions that would be consistent with this. The same conclusion is suggested by inspec- tion of the distribution of behaviour patterns exploiting stick-use, although the near-universality of fluid-dip and investigatory probe indicate that these would be the kind of simple usages from which the rarer and more sophisti- cated forms of stick use may have evolved. (ii) Supplementary information: Together with responses gathered in the course of correspondence to clarify definitions and other matters, this information indicates further ways in which behavioural patterns have come to be performed differently at different sites. Three different kinds of differentiation appear worth distinguishing. (a) Variations on a common behavioural theme Rain dance. Several respondents agreed that 'rain dance' contrasts with normal charging dis- plays in omitting intimidation of other chimpanzees, but differences between sites emerged. At Tai a rain dance is said to be totally silent and like a slow-motion version of a normal display, whereas at all East African sites, noisy pant-hoots were described, and for Gombe, Kamenya (pers. comm.) described rain dance as 'mainly fast'. At Mahale, Nishida discrimi- nated two versions, a 'noisy, vigorous type' involving several adult males and a 'silent, slow type' involving a single male. Such details suggest that further cultural variation still awaits systematic examination, and they highlight specific aspects of behaviour that may repay at- tention. Hand-clasp grooming. At Kibale, a hand-to-foot clasp is also used. Interestingly, the occur- rence of the hand-clasp itself appears to fluctuate on a relatively local basis; it is customary at Mahale yet absent at the other Tanzanian site, Gombe; and it is customary at Kibale yet absent at the other Ugandan site, Budongo. (b) Variation in the targets of an action Leaf sponge. Although leaf-sponging is universally used to obtain water from out-of-reach locations like holes in trees, at Gombe it is reported as happening frequently at streams, where the chimpanzee could drink without help from a tool. At Tai, this never occurs. Thus although leaf-sponge appears in Table 2 rather than Table 3, a future, finer systematic analysis seems destined to identify cultural variants in how it is done. Nut-hammer. This behaviour is absent from sites such as Gombe and Lope, where nuts (including oil palm nuts) are present together with suitable materials for hammers, such as stone. At TaY, where nut-cracking is extensive, we find the opposite extreme; materials used for hammers and anvils not only include all four combinations of wood and stone but may extend to materials such as hard fruits and pieces of hard termite mounds. Bossou is intermediate, with stone hammers on stone anvils being much preferred, despite the availability of other materials. Possible explanations of the more differentiated Tai repertoire include the availability of surface roots as anvils at Tai (Boesch &amp; Boesch, 1990); a relative</page><page sequence="23">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1503 abundance of stones at Bossou (Sugiyama, pers. obs.); or the fact that at Bossou only oil-palm nuts are cracked, whereas at Tai five different nuts are cracked, ranging from the abundant, soft Coula edulis that can be cracked using wooden hammers, to the very hard Panda oleosa that requires a heavy stone hammer (Boesch &amp; Boesch, 1990). As noted earlier, the behaviour of the Tai chimpanzees is suggestive of a generalized push to innovation with materials beyond those used in nut-hammering, perhaps contrasting with more customary conservatism at Bossou. Aimed throw. The targets of thrown objects also vary. At Tai throwing is reported as a component of threats towards leopards, other chimpanzees, and prey, notably monkeys. Clearly the identities of some of such potential targets may vary because they are constrained by the local environment. However at Mahale (M) and Gombe, throwing of stones into water is reported (commonly and elaborately, at Mahale) and this appears to be a distinctive pattem that could occur at several other sites, yet does not. Food-pound. Pounding is linked to different foods at different locations: Strychnos and Conopharyngea at Gombe, Balsamocitrus at Budongo, Adansonia and Strychnos at Assirik. At Tai Strychnos aculeata is pounded terrestrially, Landolphia spp. arboreally and Treculia africana in both contexts. Strychnos is available also at Mahale but not pounded open, and at Kibale Conopharyngia is reported to be bitten open. Club. Clubbing was reported to be directed at other chimpanzees at several sites (Tai, Gombe, Mahale), but also at leopards at Tai, and baboons and snakes at Gombe. At Mahale clubbing was also reported to be used for striking the ground in the context of courtship, which was not reported elsewhere, although use in aggressive displays was noted for Gombe. By contrast Kortlandt &amp; Kooij's (1963) experimental provocation of chimpanzees using a stuffed leopard, which had elicited clubbing, has been performed at Kibale where it failed to elicit this response. (c) Similar behaviour serving different functions Leaf-clip with teeth. This pattem appears to be used in quite different contexts. At Mahale and Budongo it is used in courtship and prior to copulation. In West Africa, however, it precedes buttress drumming and signals frustration at TaY, and is seen in both frustration and play at Bossou, where the action is performed with upper and lower lips. C. Independent versus clustered distributions We find no significant evidence that any pair of behavioural patterns shows a correlated distribution across the various communities. Only two behavioural patterns have the same distribution pattern (expel/stir and knuckle-knock, both of which reach at least habitual levels only at Tai, Mahale and Gombe) but the proposition that this reflects a causal linkage makes no functional sense for this pair of patterns; it is more likely they co-occur by chance. What of the possibility that the distinctive suite of behavioural patterns some of them unique - that distinguishes each individual community,</page><page sequence="24">1504 WHITEN ET AL. is explained by some distinctive 'functional core'? The most suggestive evidence of this comes from the distribution of tool use. Tai chimpanzees show 20 habitual or customary types of tool use, including nut-hammering, which requires a long apprenticeship (Boesch &amp; Boesch, 1990, 2000); at the other end of the scale, Budongo and Kibale chimpanzees show respectively only six and five kinds of simple customary or habitual tool use. Although it remains possible that this contrast reflects a greater need for technology in the Tai Forest, for ten of the Tai tools the corresponding classification at Budongo is 'absent without ecological explanation'. Accordingly, it may be hypothesised that the cluster of tool use behaviours at Tai reflects an underlying 'core cultural orientation' towards technology, manifested in a disposition to innovate and to learn socially about a variety of forms of tool use. A different kind of association is suggested by results for ant-fish. This pattern is customary at Mahale (M and K) and Assirik, where a small probe is used to extract arboreal ants. At Lope ants are also collected, but from terrestrial (subterranean) nests, and the brush-tools used for this are more similar to those described under 'brush-stick', assumed to be used to collect termites (Tutin et al., 1995). It may be that in central Africa brush tools are applied to harvesting both ants and termites, whereas in other regions finer probes are used to fish for both ants and termites. If this is so, it raises a question about whether chimpanzees generalise customary local techniques to several contexts, such that what differs between communities are suites of functionally-related approaches, rather than individual patterns alone. General discussion 1. Methodology We believe that our general approach is vindicated by the results of this study (see also de Waal, 1999). The first point to emphasise about this is that the analysis presented here and in Whiten et al. (1999) would not have been possible without the willingness of fieldworkers to pool their long-term data, gathered through extended labour over decades, across Africa. This collaborative enterprise seems to be unprecedented in the study of traditions in any animal, but the comprehensiveness of the picture it has produced</page><page sequence="25">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1505 should encourage scientists studying other candidate taxa that the approach is worthwhile. Second, the two-phase method (a first phase of drawing up a consensual and well-defined list of candidate cultural variants, followed by a second phase to code the frequency of each) merits further application. The next step required in this chimpanzee study is an updating round of data collection following this model. Lessons learned in the course of our first attempt are of two kinds. At a general level applicable to other studies of this kind, experience shows that extended efforts to agree the content and definitions of the list of behavioural patterns in Phase 1 are required. In our study, some of these required re-visiting and clarification once coders began to attempt the task of Phase 2. Accordingly, it may be more efficient to ask contributors to attempt a provisional coding for their site even during Phase 1, so as to sharpen the definitional effort that is crucial to this phase. At the more specific level of studying chimpanzee cultural variation, we discovered that the informal, additional comments that were a supplementary part of Phase 2 indicated several unsuspected behavioural variations that beg formal analysis in further studies of this kind. Accordingly, we can now begin a second, updating round of this project that will incorporate a list of putative cultural variants more refined and probably substantially longer than that used here. Recent published reports document variants not included in the pre-1999 corpus described here (Nakamura et al., 2000; McGrew et al., 2001; Nakamura, in press). Finally, written definitions of behavioural categories can suffer obvious limitations, that are highlighted when researchers attempt to identify what may be subtle behavioural differences between communities, most of which the researchers have not directly observed (e.g. see Nakamura, Table 1, in press). We have therefore embarked upon an associated, ongoing project to build an illustrated archive of examples of the behavioural patterns identi- fied, available on the internet (http:llchimp/st-and.ac.uk/cultures). Nishida et al. (1999) have published a comprehensive 'ethogram' of the Mahale chim- panzees, that should in a complementary way assist future comparative stud- ies.</page><page sequence="26">1506 WHITEN ET AL. 2. Conclusions (i) Multiple cultural variants It was noted above that most evidence for traditional patterns in animals concern only a single type of behaviour. Accordingly two findings of the present project are striking. The first is the discovery that as many as 39 behaviour patterns meet our criteria for cultural variants. The second is that each community exhibits in own profile of occurrence amongst these 39 possibilities, visualised in the 'bar-code' columns of Table 3, each of which is unique. Qualitatively at least, these findings appear to correspond to the phenomenon of multiple cultural variations amongst humans. Similarly, although quantitatively the variation we describe for chim- panzees appears unmatched in other non-human species, it is already evident that chimpanzees are not qualitatively distinctive in expressing multiple cul- tural variations. For example, van Schaik, et al. (1996; see also van Schaik &amp; Knott, 2001) identified two kinds of tool use in the same community of Sumatran orangutans, that have never been observed in long term studies in Borneo. Rendell &amp; Whitehead (2001) present evidence that transient popula- tions of killer whales on the Pacific coast of North America differ culturally from residents not only in vocal dialects but also in social structure and hunt- ing behaviour. Finally, we note that fieldworkers studying capuchin monkeys at different sites are now also beginning to collate data indicating multiple behavioural variations (Fragaszy &amp; Perry, in press). Accordingly, such taxa as these may be excellent candidates for the systematic, two-phase approach we have implemented for chimpanzees. Even for chimpanzees, however, our analysis is likely to under-represent the cultural complexity that may exist. We intentionally omitted three main classes of behaviour. The first concerns auditory communication, because specialist, technical analysis is necessary to undertake the required com- parisons. This remains to be pursued at the majority of the sites included in our study. Nevertheless, there is some evidence from both the wild (Mi- tani et al., 1992; Marshall et al., 1999; but see Mitani &amp; Gros-Luis, 1999) and captivity (Marshall et al., 1999) for cultural variation in vocalisations, creating dialects. The second omission concerns ingestion, including both nutritional intake and consumption of items with medicinal effects. There is already published evidence indicating some cultural variation in these respects (McGrew, 1983; Nishida et al., 1983; Huffman, 1997). However,</page><page sequence="27">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1507 scrutinising each case of a failure to ingest an item habitually consumed at another site was too challenging a task for the scale of our initial collabo- rative project. The third omission concerns the more specific behaviour of bed or nest-building, which like vocalisation appears to require a more sus- tained technical investigation - surprisingly perhaps, yet to be undertaken in any comprehensive way (cf Baldwin et al., 1981). Taking all these con- siderations together, it seems likely that the extent of chimpanzee cultural variation demonstrated in the present paper may be only a part (perhaps even a relatively small part) of the whole. It must be reiterated, however, that the number of cultural variants here identified - 39 - should not be seen as a rigorously-measured absolute number, easily comparable with equivalents in other taxa. This number depends in part on how categories are split or lumped. However, it is equally important to stress that this number is the outcome of two processes that make it far from arbitrary; first, our systematic two-phase procedure, which includes 'sieving' procedures in both phases; and second, iterative decision processes operating between a large number of highly experienced, long- term field researchers. We believe that if similar approaches are adopted by those studying other taxa, sensibly objective comparisons will be facilitated. (ii) Comparisons with cultural diffusion models We examined three models, which can be labeled as the 'unitary', 'multiple' and 'differentiation' alternatives. Eleven behaviour patterns were found to have quite continuous distributions of customary and habitual occurrences consistent with diffusion from a unitary source, but for all but two of these there were counter-indications to this interpretation, such as (minimal) occurrence at more distant locations. Only two behavioural patterns 'nut-hammer' in the west and 'leaf-groom' in the east - showed a good fit to the kind of distribution expected of spread from a unitary source. Another 11 behavioural patterns showed discontinuous distributions more consistent with multiple origins, a possibility made more likely by the relative simplicity of several of these patterns, making them more plausibly invented at multiple locations. Much of the variation we recorded, both formally in the questionnaire returns and more informally in supplementary comments, is consistent with the third model that incorporates differentiation in concert with diffusion, a process more deserving of the term 'cultural evolution'. Our analysis indicates differentiation of several kinds, including</page><page sequence="28">1508 WHITEN ET AL. the form of patterns (variations on an original common 'theme'), their functions, the part of the body used, the objects or targets of actions, and elaborations on tool use. The richness of these alternatives suggests this as a productive future topic of research in this area. It can also be said that for many or most of the behavioural patterns examined, it is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions about which, if any, of the three models shows the best fit with the observed data. However, this is the first time that students of animal behaviour have assembled a corpus of data with respect to which such questions can even be framed. In the past some evidence has been offered for diffusion of traditions, such as the opening of milk bottles by birds (Fisher &amp; Hinde, 1949; Hinde &amp; Fisher, 1951). A recent re-analysis of these data supports a multiple-source diffusion model, including an accelerating function consistent with cultural transmission (Lefebvre, 1995). However, such evidence is rare and concerns only a single behavioural pattern rather than the multiple variations we are dealing with in the case of chimpanzees. A similar picture holds in relation to evidence from other species that fit the differentiation model. Birds again provide some of the clearest data, notably the evidence for dialect differentiation across populations of songbirds (Jenkins, 1978; Jenkins &amp; Baker, 1984); but corresponding data sets are rare in mammals (see Noad et al., 2000), as a recent comprehensive survey confirmed (Box &amp; Gibson, 1999). Our treatment of these issues must therefore be recognised for what it is; a first exploration of the scope for large scale cultural analysis in a non-human primate. (iii) The question of core cultural tendencies or themes It has been suggested that each human culture tends to be characterised by a central cultural core or theme, that pervades a multitude of more peripheral manifestations of tradition (Boyd et al., 1997). Does anything correspond to this in chimpanzees? We found little substantive evidence for this, but two trends are worth highlighting in relation to future research. One is that some communities appear to be strikingly more oriented to tool use than others, the largest contrast being between Tai, with 20 kinds of customary or habitual tool use (Table 3), and Kibale with only five. The second is that there may be general forms of tool use that affect the specific variants that differentiate there, as suggested by the use of brush tools to harvest both ants and termites in Central Africa, which in other regions is typically done using only finer</page><page sequence="29">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1509 probes. Both of these trends should best be thought of as hypotheses to be subjected to focused testing in future research. 3. Outstanding problems and solutions in charting natural cultural -variation The behaviour patterns of interest to us as cultural variants have been identified as those achieving at least habitual levels of occurrence at one or more sites, yet also absent at one or more sites, without an environmental explanation. In addition these differences in occurrence are inferred to occur through social rather than genetic transmission. Ruling out either environmental or genetic explanations is not always easy, however. Indeed, some experimentalists have argued that it is impossible ever to be sure that environmental differences are not responsible for any variation (Galef, 1990; Tomasello, 1990). For example, where one community eats a food or uses a tool that another does not, it could be argued that one can never check every potential chemical or physical difference that might by causing this variation through individual rather than social learning. How well can we deal with these difficulties? We can consider the problems of environmental and genetic differences in turn. Different kinds of reasons are relevant to rejecting environmental explana- tions, according to the behavioural pattern concerned. One is the case where the 'environment' interacted with is other chimpanzees, so it is difficult to imagine how this could cause the systematic behavioural variations recorded. Hand-clasp grooming is the purest case of this; it could occur wherever there are chimpanzees, yet it does not. For other patterns the environmental constraints are so broad that it remains highly implausible they could be determining factors. A good example of this is rain dance, which could in principle be performed in any environment with the shakable vegetation used to enhance the display. Many other patterns in our list require only basic and universal raw materials. Several, for example, depend on leaves or other simple configurations of vegetation, of which many different kinds appear suitable for the task: this is true for self-tickle, leaf-clip (with either fingers or mouth), leaf-squash, knuckle-knock, branch-slap, leaf-groom, shrub-bend, stem-pull-through, leaf-napkin, leaf-strip, leaf-dab, leaf-inspect and branch- din. A similar case can be made for the three different forms of handling</page><page sequence="30">1510 WHITEN ET AL. ecto-parasities, for in principle it would seem the parasites could be squashed or inspected equally well against either leaf or forearm. It is with the more complex use of tools and their targets that the question of environmental determinism may be most difficult to resolve. However in the case of nut-hammering, two studies have set out to explicitly test the environmental hypothesis by directly assessing the affordances of tools and nuts in non-hammering regions (Boesch et al., 1994; McGrew et al., 1997). Both studies confirmed that tools and nuts of appropriate kinds were available and functional, the strong inference being that what explains whether nut-hammering occurs must be the availability of social models. These studies demonstrate the most rigorous form that rejection of an environmental hypothesis can take and provide good models for future research. However, in several of the remaining set of tool usages in Table 3, strong inferences can be made even when formal measurements of the materials have not been made. For example, although marrow-pick occurs at only one site, marrow bones and the small kinds of stick used as picks are commonly in evidence at other sites where the pattern is absent. In this case and nine other forms of tool use, coders reported no problems in making the judgment that environmental explanations for occurrence versus absence were sufficiently implausible to set aside. What remain are six other kinds of tool use where coders exercised the op- tion to annotate their coding with a query (i.e. those showing '?' in Table 2 and 3). This also occurred for nut-hammer at a site where formal studies like those cited above have not been performed. Such cases merit attention be- cause they highlight the kinds of problems that beg eventual resolution if en- vironmental reasons for a behaviour pattern's absence are to be clearly ruled out. Illustrative reasons a query was thought necessary included the follow- ing. (1) Pestle-pound. Although oil palms are present at Mahale, lack of any feeding on the shoots may mean they are not so suitable a food as at Bossou; alternatively at Budongo oil palms were not present but caution was ex- pressed about whether other palms might be suitable. (2) Nut-hammer. Nuts (Parinari excelsa) are available, although not cracked, at Kibale; this may be because the seed is small and may be low quality but this has not been con- firmed. (3) Termite-fish. At Budongo some termite mounds are available on the forest fringe. Although this distribution may constitute an environmen- tal reason for lack of termite fishing, it remains possible that chimpanzees' neglect of this opportunity has a cultural explanation. Residual uncertainties</page><page sequence="31">CHARTING CULTURAL VARIATION IN CHIMPANZEES 1511 like these should be resolvable through detailed studies of the kind noted above for nut-hammering. In the meantime, these behavioural patterns en- tered Table 3 as cultural variants in any case, because observers at other sites felt able to make the necessary judgments with reasonable confidence. The reasons for rejecting genetic explanations of the behavioural diversity under scrutiny are different. One is that many of the variations occur within a single sub-species (in particular, the last five columns of Table 3 concern P. t. schweinfurthii), some even between neighbouring communities (Ma and Mk). Similarly the study by Boesch et al. (1994) showed that nut- hammering was absent on one side of a large river, yet was customary on the other. In addition, many of the behaviour patterns concern tool use, and particularly where this is complex, the evidence that chimpanzees readily and flexibly learn such object use (Byrne, 1995; McGrew, 1989) means that these are poor candidates for merely instinctual variations. The possibility of instinctive variations is perhaps of most concern in the case of patterns that appear to incorporate aspects of universal chimpanzee behaviour such as aggressive displays; these include rain dance and certain forms of aimed throw (lobbing large rocks into streams at Mahale); similarly leaf-clip with fingers, shrub-bend, stem-pull-through and leaf-strip can be seen as variants on a common male tendency to attract fertile females' attention by noisily deforming vegetation. Some difficulties of interpretation thus remain in our attempt to chart cultural variation and these merit special attention in the increasing efforts to pursue such studies in other species. For Pan troglodytes, however, an overall picture of rich cultural complexity is becoming apparent.
