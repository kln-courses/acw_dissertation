<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toxic Flora, by Kimiko Hahn. Norton, $24.95 In her eighth collection, Hahn extracts beauty from the specific, the scientific, in poems inspired by ar ticles from the "Science Times" section of the New York Times. In the section which lists each poem's corresponding article, Hahn says that one of her "challenges was to live up to [the authors'] own gorgeous and urgent writings." The overall tone is factual, dispassionate, and impersonal, but the end ings tend to subvert that objective distance. Nearly every poem ends with a turn—a narrative tidbit, a personal reference, a human connection, or a daring generalization. In "Aepyornis Maximus," the extinc tion of the elephant bird is compared to "the way my first marriage feels like someone else's colony / in someone else's fervent geography." Describing the Madagascan moth, which lands on the magpie when it is asleep and drinks its tears, "Sustenance" ends with a personal connection: "A darling friend profoundly understands / since she makes her liveli hood exacting pain." In ethology, a discipline where anthropomorphism is a sin, where affective language such as "children" or "parents" is discouraged, the links that Hahn draws feel like small rebellions. Such sudden glimpses we get of the speaker, of the mind behind the facts, are what make the poems more than condensations of the longer articles. Over time, these revelations add up, and Hahn's familiar themes emerge—the brutality of family and the way language and ritual disguise bloody realities. An in terlude lists descriptions of sexual cannibalism, from the most emotionless ("an evolutionary advantage to being eaten") to the least ("complicit in their own deaths"). Toxic Flora is performed on such a finely tuned scale, with such discipline, that each tiny de viation from the overall tone can be recognized as an emotional earthquake. —Wanling Su</page></plain_text>
