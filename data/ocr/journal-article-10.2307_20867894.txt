<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Studies 97 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY By Alan Howe, University of Liverpool i. General The continuing expansion of activity in this field is reflected in the welcome appearance of Biblio 17, a new series of monographs devoted exclusively to the 17th century and serving as supplements to PFSCL. Several conference acta have appeared, of which three are concerned with regional literature. Actes . . . (Caen) has 16 papers on Norman writers, all detailed under the relevant headings below. Poesie Angevine includes four articles on 17th-century poetry and drama, itemized under individual authors, and a useful general essay: D. Courant, Tour une nouvelle etude de la poesie angevine des XVIe-XVIIe siecles: orientations et perspectives' (13-23), which indicates many areas worthy of further research. A special issue of La Vie en Champagne, Troyes, 40 pp., contains 15 short papers from a confer ence at Troyes on 29 April 1981 on 'Culture provinciale et erudition: Troyes et Dijon au XVIP siecle', of which two are pertinent: J.-P. Oddos, 'L'edition savante a Troyes au XVIP siecle' (26-30), and R. Zuber, 'La place de l'erudition dans la culture du XVIP siecle' (37 40), which counters a modern tendency to underestimate its import ance. Three other sets of acta are devoted to more general topics. NSSCFS, 4, contains articles and papers from the Society's 1981 conference on 'The Family in Seventeenth-Century France', of which eight are entered in the appropriate sections below and one may be recorded here: E. Dubois, '"Votre sexe n'est la que pour la dependance": women and marriage in seventeenth-century France' (14-26), a wide-ranging survey, amply illustrated from historical and literary sources. Actes ... (N. Orleans) has four groups of conference papers on the Lettres portugaises, Moliere, Descartes (all recorded below), and 'L'honnete homme': C. Rosso, 'L'honnete homme dans la tradition italienne et francaise' (105-23), rather too conveniently identifies the French type with Castiglione's ideal courtier, whose demise in France is located in La Rochefoucauld's maxims; S. Relyea, 'Aggression, enclosure and the caress: l'honnete homme chez ses amies' (125-52), discerns alongside the salonnieres' quest for refuge from male harrassment and for recognition of their social and intellectual worth the honnetes hommes' apparently conflicting aim to channel male aggressiveness into the 'new dominance strategy' of mastering the art of conversation ? a provocative view questioned in accompanying commentaries byj. Hubert (173-74), J. Van Baelen (178-79), and B. Norman (181-82) (see also under mere below). Actes . . . (Nice), on mythology in the 17th century, contains 28 papers 4</page><page sequence="2">98 French Studies relevant to this survey, all itemized in the appropriate sections below, except for: B. Beugnot, 'L'imaginaire de la retraite: tradition et invention d'un mythe' (7-15), a densely argued investigation of the theme, with terms of reference extending beyond the century; P. Sellier, 'Une categorie-cle de Pesthetique classique: le "merveilleux vraisemblable"' (43-48), a succinct review of literary theorists' pronouncements on this paradoxical concept during the 1670s; B. Magne, 'Le proces de la mythologie dans la Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes' (49-55), a clear exposition of the main lines of attack, defence and counter-attack, which highlights the relativism of the Ancients and the dogmatism of the Moderns (see also Howells under perrault below); P. Dumonceaux, 'Le mythe d'Orphee au cours de la premiere moitie du XVIIe siecle' (77-82), an impressionistic account of the contrasting fortunes of two aspects of the myth ? Orpheus's failure to regain Eurydice, and his talent as singer musician; B. Bray, 'Quelques formes de la vulgarisation des themes mythologiques' (127-34), a brief survey of idiosyncratic adaptations of the Theseus-Phaedra-Hippolytus myth in several 'textes de mediocre ambition litteraire'; L. Galacteros de Boissier and Y. Giraud, 'La Fortune "classique" entre le mythe et l'allegorie' (99 111), examines various conceptions of fortune (as chance, destiny, necessity, divine Providence, etc.) that inform works of the period, and identifies two main trends ('partenaire encourageante', 'Nemesis-judiciaire') which reflect the antithetical view of the Ancients (a slightly expanded version of this paper appears in PFSCL, 9, no. 17:473-510). There have been several Festschriften devoted wholly or partly to the 17th century. Three relevant items from Steele Vol. and 14 from Barnwell Vol. are detailed separately below. Mourgues Vol. also contains 14 pertinent contributions, recorded under appropriate headings below, except for: P. France, 'Equilibrium and excess' (249-61), which examines the extent to which certain types of extravagance and hyperbole were accepted or moderated by authors and theorists of the late 17th century, with particular reference to Perrault, Bouhours, and Guilleragues. Melanges Benichou includes eight distinguished articles on the 17th century, three of which are entered below (under la fontaine, perrault, descartes). A. Pizzorusso, 'L'idee d'auteur au XVI Ie siecle' (55-69), discovers disparate conceptions of author ship in statements from 15 writers, some renowned and some obscure; B. Beugnot, '(Edipe et le Sphinx: essai de mise au point sur le probleme des cles au XVIIe siecle' (71-85), considers the implica tions that keys have for modes of reading and textual reception, and suggests they run counter to a basic tenet of classicism, Tinsuffisance esthetique du modele reel'; R. Zuber, 'Litterature et urbanite' (87</page><page sequence="3">The Seventeenth Century 99 96), finds in the Latin writings of a German admirer of Guez de Balzac, D.-G. Morhof (1639-91), an interesting appreciation of contemporary French views on the social value of literature; L. Van Delft, 'Litterature et anthropologie: le caractere a Page classique' (97 115), demonstrates the role of the caractere as the expression of an anthropological investigation by considering it in terms of 'typo graphic5, 'microcosmographie5, and 'chiffre5; J. Mesnard, jan senisme et litterature' (117-35), investigates the paradox whereby, despite the apparent incompatibility of Jansenist austerity and aesthetic pleasure, Port-Royal came to propagate (and even rely upon) literature, and in doing so to favour classical taste. On a related topic, XVIIS, 34, no. 135, is a special number on 'Le Siecle de Saint Augustin5, with introduction by P. Sellier (99-102), and eight erudite articles and notes, of which three are beyond the scope of this survey, four are recorded below, and one is a valuable general item: G. Ferreyrolles, 'L5influence de la conception augustinienne de l'histoire au XVIIe siecle5 (216-41), charts out a vast area for further research in a wide-ranging preliminary survey that covers historians, politi cians, literary authors and critics, apologists, and theologians. EsC, 22, no. 3, a special issue on 'The Maxim5, has four articles treating the 17th century, of which one is of a general nature: J.J. Humphries, 'The Mad Judge, or Manners without Morals: from La Rochefoucauld's mot juste to Chamfort's mot fou' (46-58), reads the history of the maxim as a narrowing of scope, with the displacement of its focal point from society (La Rochefoucauld) to the individual in society (La Bruyere), to the self as its own society (Vauvenargues), and ultimately to the maxim itself as a mere language game (Chamfort). On a similar theme, M. Nemer, 'Les intermittences de la verite. Maxime, sentence ou aphorisme: notes sur revolution d5un genre5, SFr, 26, no. 78:484-93, seeks the common denominators of the aphorism between La Rochefoucauld and Rene Char, and defines them as assertiveness, impersonality, atemporality, and above all subversion of vraisemblance or orthodoxy. Among works covering a wide field, a significant contribution is Jeanne Haight, The Concept of Reason in Classical French Literature, 1635 1690 (Univ. of Toronto Romance Series, 45), Toronto U.P., xi 4 208 pp., which draws on works by most major authors, as well as on dictionaries and the commentaries of painters and architects, in the first extensive investigation of this important concept; uncovers a wealth of meanings and associations which render the conventional, restrictive interpretation of classical reason untenable. H. Merlin, 'Ou est le monstre? Remarques sur Testhetique de l'age classique5, RSH, no. 188:179-93, tracks down those emblematic monsters that prowl around Routes les coordonnees de l'esthetique' and represent</page><page sequence="4">100 French Studies non-adherence to classical taste. N. Aronson, 'Moliere, Perrault et la peinture', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:591-605, shows that the 'debat sur la peinture' of 1667-69, in which M. and P. championed Mignard and Le Brun respectively, reflected contrasting views on general aesthetic matters, including the nature of inspiration, the place of the artist in society, and the status of the Ancients. Rudolf Behrens, Problematische Rhetorik. Studien zurfranzbsischen Theoriebildung der Affektrhetorik zwischen Cartesianismus und Fruhaufkldrung (Reihe Rhetorik, 2), Munich, Fink, 236 pp., offers studies of Port-Royal's Logique, Cordemoy's Discours physique de la parole, Lamy's De Vart de parler, and the end-of-century controversy opposing affectation and naturalness. M. Fumaroli, 'Aulae Arcana: rhetorique et politique a la cour de France sous Henri III et Henri IV, JS, 1981 (1982): 137-89, though principally concerned with late 16th-century works, deserves mention since it demonstrates the sway of 'new' literary tendencies associated with Malherbe long before the latter's arrival at Court. S. Leoni, 'D'un conte l'autre', SLF, 8:107-18, discusses the relationship between fairy-literature, contemporary theatre and contemporary reality, in an extended critique of Pique, Tra scienza e teatro . . . (see YWMLS, 43:104). Gerard Genette, Palimpsestes: la litterature au second degre, Seuil, 472 pp., a stimulating essay on 'hypertextualite', has several passages on 17th-century parody, with frequent reference to Boileau, Scarron, and the Chapelain decoijffe.]. von Stackelberg, 'Mazarin und die Musen: zur "Literarizitat" der Mazarinaden', RF, 94:233-46, finds that eight mazarinades in the Gottingen collection begin by invoking the Muses, and postulates the influence of Scarron's Virgile travesti on this form of political criticism. Contre Retz: sept pamphlets du temps de la Fronde, ed. Colin Jones (Textes litteraires, 46), Exeter U.P., xxxvii + 62 pp., publishes previously inaccessible mazarinades critical of R. in a welcome edition, with helpful notes and bibliography, and an excellent introductory essay which elucidates their historical and literary interest. Eva Avigdor, * Coquettes et Precieuses. Avec des textes inedits, Nizet, 106 pp., includes among the inedits 'La Coquette, satyre' from B.L. MS Harley 6948. Nicole Ferrier-Caveriviere, *LTmage de Louis XIVdans la litterature francaise de 1660 a 1715, PUF, 1981, 440 pp., traces the evolution of the king's image exclusively in literary works written for publication; the author summarizes her main findings in 'L'image de Louis XIV dans la litterature francaise de 1660 a 1751 IL, 34:142-47. M. M. Rowan, 'Seventeenth-century France and Portugal: reciprocal literary influences', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:341-45, notes the role of the Rouen presses in the dissemination of Portuguese literature, and finds in verses of a Portuguese nun published in that city in 1646 strains of the 'ineffable melancholy tinged with longing' which characterizes the Lettres portugaises. M. Kruse, *'Ethique et</page><page sequence="5">The Seventeenth Century 101 critique de la gloire dans la litterature francaise du XVIIe siecle', SpMod, no. 14:31-49 (reviewed in SFr, 26, no. 78:548). Three further volumes have been added to the Repertoire biblio graphique des livres imprimis en France au XVIF siecle (Bibliotheca Bibliographica Aureliana, 86, 89, and 91), Baden-Baden, Koerner: Albert Labarre, vol. 4, 'Douai', 544pp.; Louis Desgraves, vol.5, 'Poitiers', 219pp.; and Id., vol.6, 'Albi ... Villefranche-de Rouergue', 248 pp.. Finally, W. Roberts, 'Bibliography of North American theses on seventeenth-century French literature (1981)', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:353-59. 2. Poetry Actes . . . (Nice) contains three general articles on mythology in poetry: G. Mathieu-Castellani, 'Acteon ou la rhetorique du mythe dans la poesie baroque' (33-41), on love poetry treating this myth in the period 1570-1620, gives an impressively rigorous stylistic analysis which casts light on major features of Baroque poetics ? synecdoche, figures of analogy, and the creation of a symbolic language; Y. Bellenger, 'La mythologie dans la poesie religieuse de la fin du XVIe et du debut du XVIF siecle' (153-60), notes an increasing discretion in the use of pagan myth; and E. Dubois, 'Mythe et allegorie dans la representation de la nature: l'art du jardin et son evocation dans la poesie' (209-18), is well illustrated by quotations from many poets. F. Hallyn, 'Aspects du theme de la mort dans la poesie baroque', Thanatos classique, pp. 11-28, provides subtle analyses of poems by Auvray and Malleville to attest the varied rhetorical and stylistic means employed by poets treating this 'sujet ultime du baroque'. F. J. Warnke, 'Some consolations', Mourgues Vol., pp. 109-16, uses poems on bereavement by Malherbe, Theophile, and Moliere to chart the transformations undegone by wit in the verses of classical and non classical poets. A. Mansau, 'Quelques poemes laudatifs du fonds Campistron: Abeille, Palaprat, Scudery, etc.', CLitDsS, 4:91-99, discusses some hitherto unknown, and unremittingly mediocre, verses by these and other minor poets, composed in praise of C. and the due de Vendome during the period 1696-1710. Yvonne Bellenger, Dix etudes sur le XVF et le XVIF siecle, Nizet, 223 pp., a collection of previously published articles, includes two items of interest for the 17th century on poets' representation of the day (pp. 89-99; see YWMLS, 40:96), and on obscene humour in pre-1630 poetry (pp. 191-213; see YWMLS, 42:109). bautru.

S. Vitanovic, 'La place de la mythologie dans la poetique de Boileau', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 25-31, shows that, far from providing mere ornament, myth occupied an important place in his conception of poetic inspiration and of'le sublime'. L. Van Delft, 'Sur le statut de la maxime au XVIIe siecle: esthetique et ethique dans UArtpoetique*, EsC, 22, no. 3:39-45, contends that for B. Testhetique repose sur une ethique . . . et prend constamment appui sur des maximes', and discusses the aesthetic implications of the orientation of these maxims towards the writer instead of the reader. R. T. Corum, Jr, 'Paris as barrier: Boileau's Satire VP, PFSCL, 9, no. 17:627-39, argues that the poem's aesthetic coherence is achieved by the sustained use of'threshold imagery, with associated images of penetration and obstruction', to convey the central message that Paris is a barrier to artistic creativity. A. G. Wood, 'Les noms places dans les niches: satires and sermons', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:89-101, briefly notes in B.'s satires and Bossuet's sermons a shared concern to establish their authors' moral credibility, combined with a similar approach to onomastics. U. Schulz-Buschhaus, 'Boileaus Repas ridicule. Klassische Satire und burleske Poetologie', RJ, 32, 1981 (1982) .69-91, compares B.'s technique with that of Regnier and Berni. E. F. Mengel, 'Boileau and Dryden: "To the King'", CLS, 19:416-29, supports the view of B. as a satirist of Louis XIV by arguing that D.'s well-known refusal to define the 'delicacy' that he discerned in the Lutrin stemmed from an awareness that the royal historiographer's verses contained covert satire of his king's warmon gering. deimier. J.-P. Lassalle, 'Le theme epique dans La Nereide de Pierre de Deimier', CLitDsS, 4:13-26, identifies this theme as the celebration of the battle of Lepanto in 1571, and highlights the effective use of proper names and the unusual 'sens du concret et du reel' which distinguish D.'s poetry from his contemporaries' arid efforts in the epic genre. la Fontaine. Zobeidah Youssef, La poesie de Veau dans les Fables de La Fontaine (PFSCL, Biblio 17, 3), 1981, 181 pp., is a thorough study which approaches the topic from two complementary angles ? a classification and exploration of various types of'metamorphoses des eaux', and a diachronic investigation of the theme's (uneven) treatment in successive editions. EsC, 21, no. 4, 1981 (1982), is a special number on L., with Introduction by D. L. Rubin (7-9), and nine text-based studies as follows: R. N. Nicolich, 'The triumph of language: the sister arts and creative activity in La Fontaine's Songe de Vaux' (10-21), discusses L.'s early awareness of the power and</page><page sequence="7">The Seventeenth Century superiority of poetry; J. Van Baelen, 'La chasse d'Adonis' (22-27), judges this episode indispensable to the poem's unity; W. Calin, 'Militia and amor: a reading of Adonis' (28-40), perceptively analyses L.'s reversal of the archetypal pattern of these forces; M.-O. Sweetser, 'Adonis, poeme d'amour: conventions et creation poetiques' (41-49), reads the poem as a paean to love expressing an idealized, Edenic vision; S. Tiefenbrum, 'The art and artistry of teaching in the Fables of La Fontaine' (50-65), is based on a close analysis of VHirondelle et les petits oiseaux as 'a parodic anti-model of teaching methods'; R. G. LePage, 'The 1668 edition of the Fables: an iconographic interpreta tion' (66-77), is an illuminating discussion of the theme of power in the illustrations that resulted from L.'s close collaboration with Chauveau; N. Gross, 'Order and theme in La Fontaine's Fables, Book vi' (78-89), discovers unexpected parallels with the narrative patterns of the traditional epic; R. Danner, 'La Fontaine's Fables, Book x: the labyrinth hypothesis' (90-98), posits the labyrinth (understood both literally and figuratively) as the unifying link between the book's disparate elements; J. Dejean, 'La Fontaine's Psyche: the reflecting pool of Classicism' (99-109), examines the tale's narrative structure and the implied relationship between author and reader. Mourgues Vol. has four papers on L.: M. Edwards, 'La Fontaine and the subversion of poetry' (193-200), is a penetrating study of his poetry as recreation, 'transforming and renewing language and the world', and of the technique by which this transfigurative process is simultaneously mocked and subverted; D. L. Rubin, 'Four modes of double irony in La Fontaine's Fables' (201-12), considers the problems of interpreting four fables, each of which presents two contradictory and equally (in)valid points of view; A. Seznec, 'Connaissance philosophique ? creation poetique: Discours a M"16 de la Sabliere' (213-31), reveals the ambiguity and subtlety of L.'s view of the relationship between 'nature humaine' and 'nature animale'; M. Jeanneret, 'Psyche de La Fontaine: la recherche d'un equilibre romanesque' (232-48), is an illuminating study of the synthesis that L. effected of the two alternate (polyphonic and monodic) modes adopted by 17th-century novelists. J.-P. Collinet, 'La Fontaine: de la mythologie a l'affabulation', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 265-74, discusses L.'s increasing independence in his handling of myth. M.-O. Sweetser, 'Le jardin: nature et culture chez La Fontaine', CAIEF, no. 34:59-72, finds that for L. gardens, like poetry, should effect a harmonious alliance between nature and art, spontaneity and discipline. P. Dandrey, 'Une revolution discrete: les Fables de La Fontaine et l'esthetique de la continuite ornee', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:655-74, investigates L.'s principles of combining and selecting material, relates his practice and theory to those of his</page><page sequence="8">French Studies precursors, and argues that his 'concision ornee' reconciled the rhetorical alternatives of brevitas and amplifkatio. Id., 'Commentaire compare. La fable double: Le Heron, La Fille"\ IL, 34:155-59, brings out the numerous parallels (of structure, tone, etc.) between these two juxtaposed fables, and shows how the second constitutes a 'morale illustree' of the first. M. Vincent, 'Naming names in La Fontaine's Le Chat, La Belette et le petit Lupin", RR, 73:292-301, provides a perceptive intertextual reading which successfully elucidates the skilful interplay of the languages of fable, epic, and law court. Three other articles, which also adopt an intertextual or metatextual approach, consider individual fables to connote their own creative process: M. Gutwirth, 'Reflexions sur le metier de poete: trois fables de La Fontaine', Melanges Benichou, pp. 137-51, interprets La Cigale et la Fourmi, Simonide preserve par les Dieux, and Philomele et Progne as meditations on the conditions of poetic creation and the poet's isolation; M. Vincent, 'Fragmented lovers' discourse: textuality and sexuality in La Fon taine's Les Deux Pigeons', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:675-90, on the birds' anomalous sexuality, sees the allegory of love as 'an allegory of its own reading-writing'; and B. Magne, 'La Laitiere et le Pot au lait, ou les comptes de Perrette', CLitDsS, 4:67-89, taking inspiration from Ricardou, argues that 'ce a quoi la fable nous convie, par l'apparente ecriture des aventures de Perrette, c'est a la lecture des aventures de cette ecriture'. An intertextual approach is also advocated in the preface to Contes et Nouvelles en vers, ed. Alain-Marie Bassy (Folio, 1404), Gallimard, 560 pp., a useful edition, with newly established text, ample bibliographical material, and 85 pp. of notes. See also under le moyne and saint-amant below. le bossu. V. Kapp, 'Le Bossu et l'explication allegorique de la mythologie', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 67-72, gives a brief (condensed?) account of the relationship between L.'s rationalism and his justifica tion of myth as allegory, as expounded in his Traitedu poeme epique. le moyne. An admirable and much-needed evaluation of the whole of L.'s rich and varied poetic output is provided by Richard G. Maber, The Poetry of Pierre Le Moyne (1602-1671) (Univ. of Durham Publications), Berne, Lang, 311 pp., a judicious study of his poetic theory, sources and influences, main themes, and aspects of his energetic style, imagery, and prosody. Its substantial appendix, which examines L.'s extensive textual revisions, underlines the need signalled by Q. M. Hope, 'Call for an edition of Pierre Lemoyne's Entretiens et lettres poetiques', FrF, 7:23-36, whose plea is well supported by a sympathetic appreciation of the themes, style, and structure of L.'s verse letters. J. Eymard, 'Le Moyne et La Fontaine: le mysterieux auteur qui "pensa gater" La Fontaine serait-il le Pere Le Moyne?', CLitDsS, 4:57?66, makes a credible case for identifying L. as the poet</page><page sequence="9">The Seventeenth Century 105 to whom La Fontaine referred, in a tantalizing passage of his Epitre a Huet, as 'autrefois . . . mon maitre'. malherbe. H. Fluchere, '"Beaute, mon beau souci . . .": frag ment d'un "Malherbe"', Mourgues Vol., pp.95-108, makes several suggestive comparisons with other poets in an elegant but diffuse essay on diverse aspects of M.'s art. R. Galli Pellegrini, 'L'emploi de la mythologie chez Malherbe', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 237-44, finds it employed mainly in his 'official' verses, where its function is not just exemplary and hyperbolic but also ideological, since it serves to convey the divinity of kings. D. P. Cogny, 'Paraphrase et traduction: la Paraphrase du Psaume CXLV de Malherbe', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 41-46, distinguishes M.'s aims from those of a translator, and suggests how this paraphrase may have reflected poetic taste in 1626. * Poesies, ed. Antoine Adam (Poesie, 165), Gallimard, 346 pp. marbeuf. H. Lafay, 'Pierre de Marbeuf et la nouvelle poesie de 1620', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 47-58, discusses the extent to which this Norman poet's 'esthetique de la saveur' harmonized with the main tendencies of the generation of Theophile and Saint-Amant. maynard. T. Cave, 'Desportes and Maynard: two studies in the poetry of wit', Mourgues Vol., pp. 86-94, in a close reading of a sonnet by each, defines and contrasts their individual art and shows that for both 'originality' consists in 'the discovery ... offeintes and reversals which overcome ? however momentarily ? the exhaustion of their material'. J.-P. Lassalle, 'Une decennie maynardienne (1971-1981)', CLitDsS, 4:27-29, reports on recent scholarly progress. montchrestien. F. Charpentier, 'Les poesies de Montchrestien', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 21-29, examines a neglected part of M.'s output in an introductory survey of narrative technique, themes, and style, which reveals a poet typical of the early 17th century, receptive both to the aesthetics of Mannerism and Baroque and to the poetics of Malherbe. morelles. J.-P. Chauveau, 'L'amour en deuil: David Aubin de Morelles', Poesie Angevine, pp. 88-102, enhanced by two inedits, is the first modern study of this late disciple of the Pleiade, whose Urnes de Julie (1618), while in part a naive imitation of traditional love lyrics, displays sufficient poetic qualities to justify its rescue from neglect. petit. R. Lepelley, La Muse normande de Louis Petit (1658)', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 121-30, examines the treatment of the theme of love in four of his poems, showing how use of the Rouen dialect is combined with a colloquial tone, rustic imagery, and a strong dose of burlesque. philippes pistel. M. Huchon, 'Du Tombeau de la Marguerite au Tombeau des Yvrongnes: les illustrations angevines d'un genre', Poesie Angevine, pp. 110-26, is largely concerned with P.'s curious tombeaux</page><page sequence="10">io6 French Studies celebrating the deaths of 'des nez escarlattez' which were remarkable both for their date (1611), since the genre had been popular mainly in the period 1550-1600, and for their originality, since P.'s funereal verses are Dionysian and satirical rather than consolatory and encomiastic. racine. Two articles in XVIIS, 34, no. 134, are concerned with R. in 1656: B. Munteano, 'Les chants pieux et solitaires de Racine en 1656: essai d'une chronologie' (63-66), proposes new dates of composition for Le Paysage (Spring 1656, earlier than hitherto supposed) and for three Latin pieces (Spring and Winter of that year); Id., 'Sur le jeune Racine: culture et decouverte de soi' (3-18), argues that 1656 was a period of latent dilemma for R., since while his poetry celebrates adhesion to Port-Royal and to a life of solitude, his annotations of Plutarch and selections from Quintilian signal admir ation for personal independence and interest in the social life of the city. J. Dubu, 'Racine et les jardins', CAIEF, no. 34:73-90, is a detailed enquiry which discloses, inter alia, a connection between Le Paysage and a horticultural treatise by Arnauld d'Andilly. Id., 'Mythologieet allegorie dans les poesies lyriquesde Racine', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 275-82, subtly but over-concisely analyses R.'s handling of myth in his circumstantial pieces and his Cantiques spirituels. nicolas rapin. The long-overdue first complete edition of R.'s work, (Euvres, ed. Jean Brunei and Emile Brethe (TLF, 299 and 314), 2 vols, ccxxii + 801 and xx + 608 pp., is an exemplary work of scholarship. The first two (of three) volumes, containing respectively the verses published in R.'s lifetime and those remaining inedits or printed after his death in 1608, provide an impressive critical apparatus which includes extensive biographical and literary studies, a profusion of bibliographical material, notes and 'notices', and translations of R.'s Latin writings. saint-am ant. John D. Lyons, The Listening Voice: An Essay on the Rhetoric of Saint-Amant (FFM, 40), 138 pp., reflects a recent trend of American critics in presenting S. as a self-conscious artist who, by exploring the author-reader relationship within his own verses, questions 'the values and patterns of poetic language'; the interplay between speaker and designated audience and between implied author and reader is explored in perceptive close readings of Le Contemplateur, Le Melon, and La Genereuse, while unexpected affinities between S. and Port-Royal are suggested in a final chapter that situates his rhetoric in its historical context.

(Caen), pp. 67-80, suggests that what the disparate poems designated by these labels have in common is a tendency to alternate stylistic registers, combined with the treatment of certain themes ? 'themes guerrier, mythologique, gourmand'. J. Bailbe and J. Lagny, 'Le Moyse sauve de Saint-Amant', ib., pp. 59-65, discusses those features (pastoral elements, looseness of structure, unsophisticated psychology, long descriptions) that may account for the poem's apparently critical reception in 1653. Four other articles compare S. with contemporary writers: T. Lassalle-Maraval, 'Du "visage" a "Pimage" du soleil: etude comparee de deux strophes de Saint Amant et de Tristan L'Hermite', CLitDsS, 4:5-12, is an interesting and extensive comparison of individual poetic technique in stanzas treating the theme of the sun reflected in the sea in S.'s La Solitude and T.'s Ode a la mer; C. F. Coates, 'Le fonctionnement du mythe dans la poesie du XVIT siecle', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 161-66, analyses S.'s L'Arion and La Fontaine's Le Fermier, le Chien et le Renard, and suggests that in both a centrally placed mythological passage holds the key to a politically subversive hidden message; W. Roberts, 'Bossuet's Henriette-Marie ? indebted to Saint-Amant?', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:537-51, expounds S.'s view of the English (principally as expressed in L Albion), but cites too little evidence from the oration to substantiate the claim of B.'s debt; F. Durand, 'Deux amateurs normands a la cour de Christine de Suede: Saint-Amant et Daniel Huet', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 161-67, discusses the accounts given by S. and H. of the visits they made in 1651 and 1652 respectively. sarasin. J. L. Pallister, 'Jean-Francois Sarasin: Epicurean', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:313-25, is a somewhat diffuse essay, which also attempts an etat present and rehabilitation; detects traces of Epicurean philosophy in his serious lyrical verses, but does not fully convince that S. 'is an authentic Epicurean poet'. scarron. J. von Stackelberg, 'Vergil, Lalli, Scarron. Ein Ausschnitt aus der Geschichte der Parodie', Arcadia, 17:225-44, argues that the Virgile travesti owes more to the imagination of the parodist than to imitation of S.'s Bernesque predecessor or his Latin model, which served merely as a starting-point for a work of social criticism and satire. g. de scudery. R. Gall-i Pellegrini, 'De Pimage a la structure: la description de la nature dans les Poesies diverses de G. de Scudery', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 81-90, finds from a study of representative verses from this collection (1649) that they reflect the contemporary abandonment of the Renaissance's 'conception d'un rapport univo que entre le poete et la nature' and the hesitations that this ideological shift inspired within S.'s 'milieu precieux'.</page><page sequence="12">io8 French Studies tristan l'hermite. M. Belcher, Tristan's annotations on Les Plaintes d'Acante', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:327-39, ingeniously attributes to a prosaic commentary often dismissed as naive the sophisticated aim of exploring 'the difference between poetic and non-poetic discourse'. See also under saint-amant above. viau. G. Saba, 'La poesie de Theophile de Viau', PFSCL, 9, no. 171511-35, is a general thematic study. C. Rizza, 'Place et fonction de la mythologie dans l'univers poetique de Theophile de Viau', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 255-64, treats the apparent paradox of V.'s theoretical rejection of mythology and its frequent employment in his verses, where it serves to convey his libertin ideology. C. M. Probes, 'The occult in the poetry of Theophile de Viau', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:7-20, similarly argues that the abundant traces of the occult in all parts of V.'s work constitute not mere poetic ornament but an integral element of a deterministic philosophy. mme de villedieu. J.-P. Chauveau, 'Les Elegies et les Eglogues de Madame de Villedieu', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 185-98, reveals that, while some of her other verses typify the fashionably frivolous 'poesie mondaine' of the Paris salons, the neglected elegies and eclogues that she published in the 1660s represent 'la revanche du cceur sur l'esprit' and form part of a fading poetic tradition which accorded serious treatment to the torments of love. zacharie de vitre. A. Mantero, 'Les Essays de meditations po'eti ques: de la lettre des livres saints a l'art du sonnet', XVIIS, 34, no. 137:381-98, is a valuable study of this sonnet sequence (1659), whose originality lies in the unusual relationship between each poem and the Biblical text that precedes it, the poet having substituted Biblical exegesis for traditional paraphrase; shows also that this technique ofexpositio and commentary is curiously combined with an aesthetic that is in some respects precieux. 3. Prose Georges Molinie, Du roman grec au roman baroque: un art majeur du genre narratifen France sous Louis XIII (Travaux de l'Univ. de Toulouse ? Le Mirail, ser. A, 19), Toulouse, Service des Publications de l'Univ. de Toulouse-Le Mirail, 456 pp., is a substantial study of the dominant form of prose fiction between c.1590 and c.1645, which is shown to derive from the Greek tradition of Chariton, Achilles Tatius, Longus, and Heliodorus, transmitted partly via Spain. A systematic analysis of the narrative techniques and rhetorical forms of some 36 novels demonstrates the existence of a clearly defined genre, whose charac teristic features are also shown to harmonize with the aesthetics and ethos of the Baroque.

Peggy Kamuf, Fictions of Feminine Desire: Disclosures ofHeloise, Lincoln, Nebraska U.P., xix 4- 170 pp., an essay in modern American feminist psychoanalysis, counts the Lettres portugaises and La Princesse de Cleves among those 'retellings' of the Heloise story that depict 'woman's excessive desire' struggling to avoid concealment or negation by 'a social or symbolic order'; of the former (pp. 44-66), proposes an unhelpful Freudian reading as 'a case history of hysteria', while on the latter (pp. 67-96), discusses the daughter's infidelity to Mme de Chartres's 'fantasy of impervious womanhood'.

Id., 'Le role structural de la poesie dans les romans baroques', CLitDsS, 4:31-40, examines several types of relationship between the poetry and its narrative context, and comments briefly on poetry's 'cultural' value within the novel. J. Munro, 'On the frontiers of myth: Daphnis and Chloe, the romance tradition, the Theatre Italien, and Marivaux', Steele Vol., pp. 117-36, devotes almost half of its space to 17th-century romance, ascribing to Longus's pastoral an important influence on the analysis of nascent love, and outlining the refinement and evolution of this theme from 'anonymous' adolescent love to 'pseudonymous' adult love. R. G. Hodgson, 'The parody of traditio nal narrative structures in the French anti-novel from Charles Sorel to Diderot', Neophilologus, 66:340-48, is concerned with the in medias res principle, interpolated stories, and the quest theme, all parodied by Sorel and Scarron. P. Hourcade, 'Jeux d'esprit et "production" du roman vers les annees 1640 a 1700', SFr, 26, no. 76:79-87, is a largely unavailing attempt to assess the contribution of oral activity, including conversational games, to the development of narrative art.

D. Steland, 'Literarische Schopfung als Ein bruch in die soziale Ordnung. Die moralistische Portrakunst Bussy-Rabutins in der Histoire amoureuse des Gaules\ RZLG, 6:286-305, demonstrates by a study of his portraits of Conde and Mme de Sevigne that the subversive power of B.'s work lies less in its scabrous anecdotes than in a style of portraiture that presents great figures as individuals, divested of their aura of social authority. F.-A. Mertens, 'Le theme de la mort chez Bussy-Rabutin', Thanatos classique, pp. 95-132, sedulously scrutinizes his major writings in search of a 'poetique de la mort' ? a vain quest since B.'s dominant attitude is found to be one of detachment and matter-of-factness (indicative of 'la mort apprivoisee'?), alternating at times with mockery and cynicism, and his works offer an ars vivendi rather than an ars moriendi. camus. A. de Vaucher Gravili, 'Loi et transgression dans Les Spectacles d'horreur de Jean-Pierre Camus, eveque de Belley', SFr, 26, no. 76:20-31, establishes that the predominant message of his moralizing 'histoires tragiques' is the inviolability of law ? divine, secular, or merely social. cyrano de bergerac. Timothy J.

R.

A. Capatti, 'Les sauvages hermaphrodites de Gabriel de Foigny', SLF, 1981:100-15, suggests from an examination of its role and attributes in La Terre Australe connue that the hermaphrodite constitutes a meeting point of myth, imaginary voyage, religion, and anthropology. P. Ronzeaud, 'Raison et deraison de l'imaginaire utopique: La Terre Australe connue de G. de Foigny', RLMC, n.ser., 35:141-57, eruditely examines the 'tours de passe-passe argumentaires' and forms of allegory employed in the elaboration of F.'s fiction, and provides a fascinating discussion of the complex (partly traditional, partly original) symbolism of his 'pay sage urbain austral'. mlle de gournay. A. Franchetti, T tempi narrativi nel Proumenoir di Mlle de Gournay', ib., 125-39, compares the little-known but much-corrected 1623 version of this work with several other editions and ascertains that, although aware of the effectiveness in narrative of substituting the present tense for the past, G. modified her text with increasing rigour in 1623 and 1626 to bring it into line with the precepts of Oudin. guilleragues. A significant event in G. studies is Jean-Pierre and Therese Lassalle, Un manuscrit des Lettres d'une Religieuse portugaise. Legons, interrogations, hypotheses (PFSCL, Biblio 17, 6), 237 pp., which reproduces the first known (possibly original) MS, in which the five celebrated letters are preceded by the seven printed separately by Barbin. The critical apparatus of notes, variants (from the 1669 ed.), and assorted commentaries (palaeographic, orthographic, gramma tical, lexical, historical, stylistic) support the attribution to G. (perhaps aided, it is suggested, by Moliere) and indicate the unity of the 12-letter work. These findings are also summarized and assessed by W. Leiner, 'Du nouveau sur le texte de Guilleragues: la decouverte par Therese et Jean-Pierre Lassalle d'un manuscrit de 12 Lettres Portugaises', Actes ... (N. Orleans), pp. 97-102. F. Deloffre, 'A propos d'une edition: les Lettres portugaises vingt ans apres', XVIIS, 34, no. 134:67-76, convincingly repudiates the arguments and hypotheses advanced by another recent editor, Y. Florenne, in his Livre de Poche ed. (see YWMLS, 42:116). Actes de New Orleans also contains six complementary and sometimes overlapping conference papers on the controversial fourth letter, whose positioning Coulet had considered detrimental to the work's coherence: B. Beugnot, 'La IVe Portugaise:</page><page sequence="16">112 French Studies concordance et interpretation' (19-34), adds lexical evidence to the arguments marshalled in the other papers against Coulet's position; S. L. Carrell, 'From dialogue to monologue: Mariane's fourth letter' (43-53), discerns among the marks of enhanced self-awareness that constitute a progression from the first three letters a realization that the illusory dialogue has become a conscious monologue (see also this critic's monograph detailed above); G. Malquori-Fondi, 'Le passe comme element thematique et narratif dans la IVe Lettre Portugaise' (55-72), the most substantial of these papers, discusses those passages (which employ the 'passe simple') in which Mariane relives the early stages of her passion while reviewing them with newly gained lucidity; G. Verdier, 'Remarques sur le style et la rhetorique des Lettres portugaises' (87-96), considers the fourth letter as an example of forensic rhetoric; R. G. Hodgson, 'Le roman paradoxal: une analyse des polarites dans Les Lettres Portugaises' (73-86), supports Spitzer against Coulet by arguing that the numerous stylistic and thematic antitheses in the fourth letter successfully convey the paradoxical nature of Mariane's dilemma; and B. Bray, 'La signification des structures adversatives dans la IVe Lettre Portugaise' (35-41), furnishes further examples of the antithetical method, but suggests that their function is to prepare ultimate emancipation through self-knowledge. mme de lafayette. A welcome addition to the growing list of modern editions is Zaide, histoire espagnole, ed. Janine Anseaume Kreiter, Nizet, 183 pp., w^tn text based on the 1670-71 edition, a competent critical apparatus, and an introduction which gives a useful structural and thematic analysis, highlighting the cohesion of the various episodes and the main narrative thread. J. Trethewey, 'The "realism" of La Princesse de Cleves9, Romance Studies, no. 1:18-34, is a perceptive study which looks beyond purported psychological realism to consider, as a major case of L.'s stylization of reality, the motives and effects of her exclusion from the novel of any allusion to religion. D. Shaw, 'La Princesse de Cleves and classical pessimism', ML, 63:222-31 &gt; covers mainly familiar ground in a competent general study that rej ects the 'Cornelian interpretation' ? though not every reader will be convinced that the heroine resists Nemours 'by accident'. R. W. Redhead, 'Madame de Lafayette's ironic tone', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:75 84, cites many instances, but provides no serious critical comment. M. Desimeur, 'La Princesse de Cleves ou l'odyssee feerique', SFr, 25, no. 75, 1981 (1982): 440-47, offers a novel and suggestive reading of the episode of Nemours's nocturnal visit to Coulommiers by comparing L.'s technique with that of contemporary writers of fairy-tales. mme de la guette.

See under perrault below. perrault. M. Fumaroli, 'Les enchantements de Peloquence: Les Fees de Charles Perrault ou De la litterature', Melanges Benichou, pp. 153-86, gives a fascinating parallel reading of P.'s tale and Mlle L'Heritier's version, Les Enchantemens de Veloquence (1694), and shows that these two accomplished illustrations of the Modernist thesis belong to the tradition, not of popular art, but of court culture. R.J. Howells, 'Literary relativism in the Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes', FSB, no. 4:4-6, denies that P. was a relativist, and stresses that the Moderns were 'proponents of absolute literary norms, now based all too directly on their own culture' (see also the article by Magne under General above). g. de scudery. E. Woodrough, 'Georges and Madeleine de Scudery: "mer d'inimitie", "lac d'indifference", or "amitie tendre"?', NSSCFS, 4: 76-86, argues that their literary collaboration was closer, and their emotional attachment deeper, than has been traditionally allowed, and submits that it was from her testing relationship with G. that M.'s theory of'amitie tendre' derived. mlle de scudery.

P. de Lajarte, 'Les Nouvelles franqaises de Segrais, ou les glissements progressifs du recit', ib., pp. 145-59, presents a structural analysis of five of the tales, distinguishing between 'pure' and 'deviant' forms of the 'nouvelle heroique'. J.-P. Collinet, Segraisiana, Huetiana: deux ecrivains normands devant le gout de leur temps', ib., pp. 131-43, elucidates the conflicting conceptions of literary taste and the contrasting literary personalities that emerge from a comparison of these ana: the expression of S.'s affinities and antipathies constitutes a sort of 'Philintiana' mirroring the tastes of its milieu, while H.'s more independent 'Alcestiana' defends a taste that is no longer fashionable.</page><page sequence="18">French Studies mme de sevigne. Roger Duchene, Madame de Sevigne ou la chance d'etre femme, Fayard, 480 pp., is an authoritative and readable biography, presenting a finely-nuanced portrait of woman and writer that is based on a vast fund of erudition ? which makes it all the more regrettable that no exact references are given to source material. Catherine Montford Howard, Les fortunes de Madame de Sevigne au XVII et au XVIII siecles (Etudes Litteraires Francaises, 18), Tubingen, Narr ? Paris, Place, 119 pp., is a systematic study of the fluctuations in the early stages of S.'s literary reputation, between 1697 and 1789, based on a wealth of primary sources, many hitherto neglected or unknown. I. Landy-Houillon, 'Une expression feminine de l'amour au XVIIe siecle: Pexemple de Madame de Sevigne', IL, 34:194-97, is concerned mainly with the language in which S.'s feelings for her daughter are expressed. sorel. Andrew G. Suozzo, Jr, The Comic Novels of Charles Sorel: A Study of Structure, Characterization and Disguise (FFM, 32), 145 pp., an investigation of S.'s use of 'the illusion game' (i.e. the struggle to distinguish between illusion and reality) as the vehicle for his literary and social satire, devotes its three main chapters to the structural patterns achieved by the modulation of similar and contrasting episodes, the polarization of characters between manipulators of illusion (heroes and anti-hero) and its victims (monomaniacs and madman), and the use of language and the portrait as analogues to disguise ? all of which are shown to contribute to the work's overall coherence. J. Trethewey, 'Ambivalence or irony? Charles Sorel's Francion\ NSSCFS, 4:60-68, discusses the elements of plot and characterization that prepare for the moral lesson of Book xn by detracting from the author's largely sympathetic presentation of his protagonist; and raises the possibility that S.'s irony may be directed against his readers. urfe. L. A. Gregorio, 'Implications of the love debate in L'Astree3, FR, 56:31-39, comments interestingly on the undermining of the heroic code through the dichotomy between Adamas's theocentric and Silvandre's anthropomorphic conceptions of love, and then more predictably posits ambiguity as the novel's 'central structuring device'. P. Pelckmans, 'L'Astree ou la discretion de la mort appri voisee', Thanatos classique, pp. 20/-58, a subtle exploration of an elusive topic, contrasts U.'s treatment of death with that of his Baroque contemporaries and relates it also to the evolution in attitudes diagnosed by modern historians; suggests that, despite the primacy it accords to love, UAstree does not foreshadow the Romantic 'mort de toi' as defined by P. Aries, but rather illustrates the latter's thesis of the 17th century's familiarity with death.</page><page sequence="19">The Seventeenth Century 4. Thought XVIIS, 34, no. 135, a special issue on 'Le Siecle de Saint Augustin', has two articles on general subjects: J. Lafond, 'Augustinisme et epicurisme au XVIIe siecle' (149-68), investigates two aspects of the subject, each partly involving the problematics of pleasure ? the relationship between forms of Augustinianism and Euricureanism during the latter's period of'rehabilitation et diffusion' after 1660, and the equating of the two doctrines in anti-Jansenist polemics after 1685; G. Rodis-Lewis, 'Les essences eternelles et leur creation: le detournement d'un texte augustinien' (211-15), discusses differing interpretations among Cartesians of a phrase quoted frequently by Desgabets with regard to the theory of eternal truths. No. 136 is also a special number, on 'Matiere et lumiere au XVIIe siecle', with introductory essay by P.

W. P. Jacoebee, 'The classical sermon and the French literary tradition', AJFS, 19:227-42, regards the sermon as primarily a literary production in which 'the application of the principles of a particular esthetics was demanded and observed', and briefly sketches the evolution of this aesthetic from the 17th to the 19th century.</page><page sequence="20">n6 French Studies Jurgen von Stackelberg, Franzbsische Moralistik im europaischen Kontext (Ertrage der Forschung, 172), Darmstadt, WBG, vi + 217 pp., while surveying the whole period between the Renaissance and the Enlighten ment, devotes much of its space to the 17th century, concentrating on ideas rather than form or style; chapters on Mme de Sable (compared with Gracian), La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyere, and three lesser figures (Saint-Real, Retz, Saint-Evremond) assess recent research and situate these moralistes within a developing tradition.

Geraud Tournadre, *L'orientation de la science cartisienne (Bibliotheque d'His toire de la Philosophic), Vrin, 320 pp. Mikio Kamiya, *La thiorie cartisienne du temps, Tokyo, Librairie-Editions France Tosho, xv 4 143 pp. Charles Krejtman, *Pour Descartes: le processus logique de la pensie conjuse, Hallier and Michel, 143 pp. Actes . . . (N. Orleans) devotes a section to a group of conference papers on D.: G. Rodis-Lewis, 'Creation des verites eternelles, doute supreme et limites de l'impossible chez Descartes' (277-318), is a searching and scholarly exposition of Cartesian epistemology which demonstrates the importance of the transcendence of God to both his metaphysics and his physics; C. Gaudiani, 'La lumiere cartisienne: metaphore et phenomene opti que' (319?36), relates D.'s metaphor of'la lumiere naturelle' to his scientific theories of light, and provides a useful bibliography on the subject; P. Wolfe, 'Commentaire sur la metaphore optique chez Descartes' (337-41), a commentary on Gaudiani's paper, disagrees that the term 'lumiere' functions metaphorically in D.; D. Judovitz, 'Le Discours de la mithode: theorie du sujet comme pratique litteraire' (343-62), contends that in the Discours D. denies his own exemplarity and conceives of his work as an autobiography composed uniquely for its author's private pleasure ? an unpersuasive theory whose premises are contested in a 'Commentaire' (363-68) by J.-F. Battail. Two other articles also examine the status of the 'Je' in D.'s texts: M.-R. Carre, 'Le Moi du philosophe et le Je de Descartes', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:283-303, discerns contrasting methods of persuasion in the Regulae and the Discours, the former assertively demanding acquies cence, the latter more subtly seeking consent by inspiring the reader's emulation of the narrator-protagonist; and J. D. Lyons, 'Subjectivity and imitation in the Discours de la mithode', Neophilologus, 66:508-24, probes further into the author-reader relationship and the role of the problematic T, and distinguishes usefully between 'the</page><page sequence="22">n8 French Studies autobiographical subject, the ethical subject, and the metaphysical subject'. G. A. Wilson, 'Henry of Ghent and Rene Descartes on the unity of man', Franziskanische Studien, Werl, Westphalia, 64:97-110, detects in D.'s writings two separate philosophies of man, which stress alter nately his psychophysical dualism and his unity, and relates these positions to the philosophical controversy in which the medieval theologian was embroiled. P. Cahne, 'Saint Augustin et les philo sophes au XVIP siecle: ontologie et autobiographic', XVIIS, 34:121-32, examines the grounds on which an affirmative reply may be given to Gouhier's question 'D. lecteur de saint Augustin?'. F. Alquie, 'Le rapport de la science et de la religion selon Descartes, Malebranche et Spinoza', Melanges Benichou, pp. 187-202, writes authoritatively on the distinction between 'Cartesianism' and D.'s own philosophy, stressing that while D., by recognizing divine grace as well as natural reason as a source and criterion of truth, separated theology from science, later rationalists such as M. and S. made the former dependent upon the latter. S. Martinet, 'Role du probleme de la lumiere dans la construction de la science cartesienne', XVIIS, 34, no. 136:285-309, traces the development of D.'s interest in this problem and explains in detail the fundamental significance of its solution for his entire system. J. W. Lynes, 'Descartes' theory of elements: from Le Monde to the Principes\ JHI, 43:55-72, lucidly expounds the differences between D.'s initial development of this theory in the former and his extended, 'sharpened' version in the latter. D. Garber and L. Cohen, 'A point of order: analysis, synthesis and Descartes's Principles9, AGP, 64:136-47, argues against the traditional view that the distinction between analysis and synthesis accounts for the relation between the differing metaphysical argu ments of the Meditations and the Principes. R. A. Imlay, 'Descartes and indifference', Studia Leibnitiana, Wiesbaden, 14:87-97, discusses D.'s inconsistency in holding that some reasons for choice are 'evidentially compelling', while also 'insisting on genuinely open alternatives . . . as a necessary condition for any choice'. M. Burnyeat, 'Idealism and Greek philosophy: what Descartes saw and Berkeley missed', Philo sophical Review, Ithaca-N.York, 91:3-40, relates their thought to ancient scepticism, arguing that D. was keenly aware that he was able to transcend the limitations of the ancient tradition. J. Deprun, 'Cartesianisme et mythologie', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 17-24, discovers an ambivalent attitude in D. and his followers, whose philosophy rejects the supernatural but whose writings make frequent use of mythological allusion. Finally, the CNRS Equipe Descartes has produced its 'Bulletin cartesien xi', Archives de philosophic, 45, no. 4:1-65 (separate pagination): the liminary study, L. (Eing-Hanhoff, 'Descartes et la princesse Elizabeth' (1-33), a well-documented</page><page sequence="23">The Seventeenth Century "9 account of their relationship, is followed by an excellent critical bibliography of Cartesian studies for the year 1980 (37-65). desmarets de saint-sorlin. H. G. Hall, 'A polemical Parisian wall poster in 1666: Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin vs. Port-Royal', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:305-11, reproduces and discusses the hitherto unrecorded reply (probably by Nicole or someone close to him) to a lost wall poster by D. during the 'Querelle des Imaginaires'; this pamphlet furnishes further evidence that D. 'was not an isolated visionary, but a close associate of the highest Church authority in Paris, respected for his theology as well as for his mysticism'. R. Briand, 'La contestation de la mythologie dans la litterature au nom de la spiritualite chretienne', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 57-65, explains D.'s attack on pagan mythology and his championing of'le merveil leux chretien' in terms of the mission he assigned to literature of bringing the reader 'a la connaissance de la vie interieure et a l'experience mystique'. fenelon. Volker Kapp, Telemaque de Fenelon: la signification d'une ceuvre litteraire a la fin du siecle classique (Etudes Litteraires Francaises, 24), Tubingen, Narr ? Paris, Place, ii 4 259 pp., is an impressively documented attempt to relate the work to its contemporary cultural ethos and to 17th-century publications on princely education (of which a useful bibliography of 150 items is provided); the three main sections are devoted to the work's pedagogical, religious, and political dimensions, and they stress the primacy of its instructive (and particularly religious), as opposed to purely literary, intent. M.A. Cor, 'The shield of Telemaque', RoN, 23:17-21, notes that F.'s description in Book xni presents an allegory both of the relationship between war and peace and of the personal qualities desired in the ideal prince. D. Fricke, 'Les errances pedagogiques de Telemaque: l'eleve de Fenelon entre Venus et Minerve', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:693-726, discusses F.'s use of mythology, with particular empha sis on the political and sentimental aspects of Telemaque's appren ticeship in self-knowledge. M. Haillant, 'Culture antique et imagina tion dans les ceuvres de Fenelon "ad usum Delphini"', IL, 34:108-12, offers a general appreciation of the themes and qualities of F.'s pedagogical writings, with stress on his originality both in his method of imitating the Ancients and in the deployment of his imagination. W. S. Howell, 'Baroque rhetoric: a concept at odds with its setting', PhilR, 15:1-23, devotes several pages to the Dialogues sur Veloquence, which are held to involve a confrontation between Baroque and neo-classical rhetoric. gassendi.

C. Jouhaud, 'La construction de l'image de l'autre chez Jean de Gaufreteau', XVIIS, 34, no. 134:51-61, a rare study of the Chronique bordeloise, examines the view that G. presents of the rural and urban lower classes and of women ? groups normally excluded from the parlementaires' conception of Tidentite citadine'. gueudeville. Aubrey Rosenberg, Nicolas Gueudeville and his Work (1632-172?) (Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Idees, 99), The Hague, Nijhoff, vii + 285 pp., is a useful study of the life and varied writings of a minor figure who was none the less representative of the important group of French exiles in Holland; the rich fund of bibliographical information in the extensive appendices (pp. 147-212) and the notes is a valuable aid to further research. mme guyon. M.-F. Bruneau, 'Mysticisme et folie ou Pexperience de Jeanne Guyon', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:37-55, places the author of the Vie on the psychoanalyst's couch, and writes up a well-informed and cogently-argued report on her 'psychosis', which points up the analogies between her mysticism and delirium and resolves the seeming ambiguities in her attitude towards God. huet. See section 2 above under saint-amant, and section 3 above under segrais. la bruyere. D. Bilous, 'Recrire l'intertexte: La Bruyere pas ticheur de Montaigne', CLitDsS, 4:101-20, treats 'De la Societe', 30, within the context of a theoretical deliberation on 'mimetisme textuel' and the various levels of correlation ('ideologique, interstylistique, intratextuelle, meta-textuelle') between the pastiche and its 'inter text'. pierre de lancre. * Tableau de Vinconstance des mauvais anges et demons, ou it est amplement traite des sorciers et de la sorcellerie, ed. Nicole Jacques-Chaquin, Aubier-Montaigne, 392 pp. leon de saint-jean. C. Vasoli, 'Tra mistica ed enciclopedia: lo Studium sapientiae e Le Portrait de la Sagesse universelle di P. Leon de Saint Jean', SFr, 26, no. 77:211-32, studies L.'s neglected 'encyclopedic' works against the tradition that inspired them, and concludes that 'il fine ultimo della sua "enciclopedia" resta pur sempre l'ossessiva proposta dell'unica "Sapienza universale", un'ideale pansofico che recupera in chiave teologica e mistica i temi "illuministici" tradi zionali e un'immagine del mondo di antica vocazione platonica e dionisiana'. malebranche. Michael E. Hobart, Science and Religion in the Thought of Nicolas Malebranche, Chapel Hill, North Carolina U.P., x + 195 pp., provides insight into the tangled relationship in M.'s thought between knowledge and belief by seeking out his 'implicit or</page><page sequence="25">The Seventeenth Century 121 submerged intellectual structures'; argues that while his science was firmly founded upon 'number' ('newly emerging patterns and assumptions, keyed on mathematics'), his metaphysics and theology were 'formulated along the model of "substance"' (traditional and largely scholastic patterns and assumptions). M. Adam, 'L'amitie selon Malebranche', RMM, 87 :31-49, lucidly explicates the ideas expounded on this subject in M.'s Traite de morale, and relates them both to other major themes of 'la pensee malebranchiste' and to the views on friendship of earlier philosophers. F. Azouvi, 'Genese du corps propre chez Malebranche, Condillac, Lelarge de Lihnac et Maine de Biran', Archives de philosophic, 45:85-107, an investigation of these four writers' theories on the problem of acquiring consciousness of one's own corporality, shows the distinction on this point between M. and Descartes. See also under bayle and descartes above. mere. J. D. Lyons, 'Being and meaning: the example of the honnete text', Actes ... (N. Orleans), pp. 153-72, takes M.'s Conversations as the focus of a penetrating exposition of the ontological aspects ofhonnetete, regarded as devoid of any meaning beyond itself, comprehensible only at the moment of expression, and communicable solely by exemplification. This paper is accompanied by (largely approving) commentaries byj. Hubert (175-76), J. Van Baelen (177-79), and B. Norman (181-82). mersenne. A. Beaulieu, 'Lumiere et matiere chez Mersenne', XVIIS, 34, no. 136:311-16, suggests that, despite M.'s reluctance to declare his views on this subject, his correspondence and published works disclose 'une pensee qui s'elabore'. naude. Lettres de Gabriel Naude a Jacques Dupuy (1632-1632), ed. Phillip Wolfe, Edmonton, Alberta, Lealta/Alta Press, 146 pp., a most useful edition, with explanatory notes, introduction and index, of 44 letters (all but one previously unpublished, and the majority written from Italy) containing interesting observations on the literary, intellectual, and political life of the time. pascal. Les Pensees, ed. Francis Kaplan, Eds du Cerf, 705 pp., presents an important reclassification of the fragments, based on the internal evidence of the text itself and justified in a long and cogently argued preface (7-97). Accompanied by notes, full tables of sources and concordances, and an extensive list of 'divergences de lecture' that permits comparison with all other major editions, the text offered (with pensees now totalling 1,460) gains in continuity and readability and gives a firmer impression of completeness, as well as a sig nificantly modified image of its author: 'un Pascal dont les arguments ne sont pas, pour l'essentiel, philosophiques, psychologiques ou moraux, mais exegetiques.' Robert J. Nelson, Pascal, Adversary and Advocate, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard U.P., 1981, vii + 286 pp.,</page><page sequence="26">122 French Studies combines perceptions derived from several modern critical currents in a subtle psychological, theological and linguistic study, which works chronologically through P.'s intellectual and spiritual career and the whole body of his writings, and traces a tripartite dialectical development described as 'in theological terms . . . conservative liberal-conservative'. Thomas More Harrington, Pascalphilosophe: une etude unitaire de la pensee de Pascal, SEDES-CDU, 189 pp., argues P.'s claim to recognition as a serious and original philosopher, whose Pensees and scientific works (studied here in their entirety) are unified by a coherent philosophy which, though serving ultimately to sustain his Christian faith, is independent of the latter. N. Boyle, 'Pascal, Montaigne, and "J.-C": the centre of the Pensees9, JES, 12:1-29, contributes to the debate about the fundamental dualism or unity of P.'s thought by conducting an erudite and lucid investigation of his 'protracted intellectual struggle' with Montaigne; concludes that 'in name, function, and attributed qualities, the Christ of Pascal is a transmutation of the self of Montaigne'. L. Thirouin, 'Raison des effets: essai d'explication d'un concept pascalien', XVIIS, 34, no. 134:31-50, casts light on P.'s complex conception of causality by essaying a precise definition of the terms 'raison' and 'effet' in P.'s work, and of their conjunction in the title of his fifth liasse. E. Moles, 'Logic and singularity in Pascal's wager', FS, 36:397-409, a succinct and rigorous exegesis, refutes Boyle (see YWMLS, 42:128) and concentrates mainly on those points at which P. is (mis)led into paradox and ambiguity by a desire 'to transcend the mathematical scaffolding of the "regie des partis"'. J.-L. Gardies, 'L'interpretation d'Euclide chez Pascal et Arnauld', EP: 129-48, investigates the extent of agreement between P. and A. on the status of definitions and use of apagogic arguments, showing the implications of the latter for P.'s contention in the Pensees that 'on peut bien connaitre l'existence d'une chose, sans connaitre sa nature'. C. Meurillon, 'La machine arithmetique a la genese des ordres pascaliens', RSH, no. 186-87:147-58, is a fascinating contribution which uncovers unex pected parallels between the circumstances attending the invention, construction, dedication and use of P.'s adding machine and his important theory of orders. L. Marin, 'Le lieu du point? Pascal', EDL, no. 2:17-38, is a stylish essay in which pensees containing the words 'lieu' and 'point' trigger commentary on central themes of the apology. Id., 'Discours du pouvoir / pouvoir du discours: commen taires pascaliens', MichRS, 2:29-71, adopts a similarly impressionis tic approach to various aspects of the relationship between power and discourse ? including 'le pouvoir du discours du pouvoir' (!). Several other articles also explore aspects of P.'s rhetoric: A. Michel, 'Saint Augustin et la rhetorique pascalienne: la raison et la beaute dans</page><page sequence="27">The Seventeenth Century 123 YApologie de la religion chretienne', XVIIS, 34, no. 135:133-48, measures P.'s debt both directly to St Augustine and more generally to the Augustinian tradition, and concludes from an erudite investigation that P.'s theory of eloquence, though essentially Augustinian, 'depasse Augustin par ce qu'elle a de combatif et d'austere'; S. E. Melzer, 'Invraisemblance in Pascal's Pensees: the anti-rhetoric', RR, 73:33~44&gt; provides an interesting discussion of the Pensees' structure, use of language, and 'authorial manipulative intrusions', arguing that, unlike classical rhetorical conventions whose purpose is to create an illusion of truth, P.'s 'new rhetoric' requires an interpreta tive process, the self-conscious nature of which impresses upon the reader a perception of the distance that separates Fallen Man from Truth; G. Montcriol, 'Le discours nomade de Pascal et de Nietzsche', Revue philosophique de la France et de Fetranger, 172:3-27, similarly argues that the fragmented, aphoristic form of their writings should be interpreted, not merely as an accident of circumstance, but as a legitimate and effective mode of philosophical discourse, 'renvoyant a une conception specifique de l'etre et de la connaissance, de la lecture, ainsi que de la relation du penseur a l'ceuvre'; and P. Carrive, 'Note sur la rhetorique de trois pensees de Pascal', EP: 227-30, gives a brief stylistic analysis of B.298-300. R. L. Barnett, 'Maxim-al codes of minimal closure: Pascal's sequestered schema', EsC, 22, no. 3:28-38, purportedly an exercise in 'decoding', has itself been 'encoded' in an impenetrably opaque language. R. J. Nelson, 'I, Eye and Aye: points of view in Pascal and Laclos', FrF, 7:101-08, briefly treats the implications ('psychological, narratological and moral') of these homonyms (designating the epistolary 'je', vision and assent) for an interpretation of P.'s Lettres provinciates and L.'s Les Liaisons dangereuses. Finally, Chroniques de Port-Royal, no. 31, prints 11 papers from the conference of the Centre International Blaise Pascal at Clermont Ferrand in October 1981, on 'Deux grandes figures d'Auvergne: Gilberte et Jacqueline Pascal'. Included are several items of interest for Blaise, most notably: G. Descamps, Jacqueline et Gilberte Pascal, temoins de la conversion de Blaise' (31-44); P. Sellier, 'Pour une poetique de la legende: La Vie de Monsieur Pascal' (51-68); and P. Ernst, 'Les autographes de Gilberte dans l'original des Pensees' (69 92), a meticulous study of the role, content and coherence of her contribution.

Lafond, '"Cogito" et gout chez Saint Evremond', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 169-74, analyses the role for S. of good taste, which takes the form of a sensual 'cogito', since it constitutes 'cette saveur qui accompagne le sentiment de . . . Yexister dans ce qu'il a de plus aigu'. J.-M. Bailbe, 'Saint-Evremond juge de l'art lyrique', ib., pp. 175-84, sets against the background of the development of opera in 17th-century France the perceptive views that S. formulated c. 1670 on the perennial problem of the status of the librettist in the fusing of music, poetry, and spectacle. saint-real. *De Vusage de I histoire (1671), Lille, Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherches sur la Litterature des XVIIe et XVIIP siecles, reproduces the text of the Dutch edition of 1693, with critical apparatus, biography, bibliography, and two critical essays: R. Demoris, 'Saint Real et l'histoire'; and 'C. Meurillon, 'Saint-Real et Pascal'. sales. W. C. Marceau, 'L'heritage augustinien chez Saint Francois de Sales', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:137-49, finds that St Augustine, though frequently cited by S., exerted no direct doctrinal influence but merely provided 'des recits rapportes, des comparaisons, des exemples'. sarrau. See under rivet above. 5. Drama Drama has once again inspired more publications than any other category, and these have included several studies of high quality. H. T. Barnwell, The Tragic Drama of Corneille and Racine: An Old Parallel Revisited, OUP, xxi + 275 pp., *s an excellent work which, while eschewing anachronistic interpretations, manages to overturn several critical commonplaces; adopting the Aristotelian standpoint that plot is 'the soul of tragedy', examines various elements of dramatic construction from initial situation to denouement, and finds between</page><page sequence="29">The Seventeenth Century 125 the two dramatists subtle patterns of convergence and divergence with regard to both their dramatic technique and the problematic 'tragic quality' of their works. Wolfgang Matzat, Dramenstruktur und Zuschauerrolle: Theater in der franzbsischen Klassik (Theorie und Ges chichte der Literatur und der Schonen Kiinste, 62), Munich, Fink, 336 pp., differentiates between the 'dramatic', 'theatrical', and 'real world' perspectives of drama reception, and within the framework of these categories conducts three parallel studies of Corneille and the theatre of'gloire', Racine and the theatre of passion, and Moliere and the theatre of 'deraison'. Jan Van Dyck, La Comedie, echo de la vie litteraire au XVIT siecle, 1630-1685, Louvain, Cabay, 275 pp., is a methodical study of the copious sub-genre of comedies inspired by literary activity, which examines in turn comedies critical of other dramatists (Moliere, Corneille, Racine), those whose characters are modelled on the literary circles of the time, and those inspired by topical literary events. TJ, 34, no. 3, is a special issue on 'Deconstruc tions: Corneille and Moliere', with Introduction by D. McDonald (288), and eight articles detailed under the individual authors below. Barnwell Vol. has 14 contributions on aspects of'aesthetic coherence' in 17th-century drama, also itemized under individual names below. Actes . . . (Nice) includes five general papers on mythology in dramatic literature: R. W. Tobin, 'Le mythe d'Hercule au XVIIe siecle' (83-90), limited to the theatre, is a summary investigation, though not devoid of alluring suggestions, such as that his reincarna tions include Racine's Alexandre and Hippolyte; D. Dalla Valle, 'Les dieux caches (ou le conceptisme des dieux): les oracles dans le genre pastoral au XVIIe siecle' (145-52), proposes a novel interpretation of the oracle in pre-1640 pastorals as less a vestige of classical convention than a reflection of a deep-rooted spiritual attitude which foreshadows the 'tragic vision' of Racine's generation: J. Morel, 'Histoire et mythologie dans la tragedie francaise du XVIIe siecle' (167-75), is an over-schematic general survey, which does, however, proffer the curious notion of "mythologisation" de l'histoire dans les structures, "historicisation" de la mythologie dans les themes'; R. Guichemerre, 'Le burlesque mythologique dans le Theatre italien de Gherardi' (187-96), is a useful reassessment, showing that these comedies (acted at the Bourgogne in 1681-97) derived their techni ques from Scarron and other burlesque poets of the period 1644-56, and aimed less to support the Moderns' onslaught on mythology than to satirize contemporary manners, machine plays and opera; C. Delmas, 'Mythologie et magie dans la tragedie a machines (1660-1671): les dieux illusionnistes' (197-208), is a well-ordered inquiry into the implications of the relegation of the gods to the role of magicians. Other aspects of tragedy are treated by M. Delcroix, 'Les</page><page sequence="30">126 French Studies "realia" macabres: un aspect de la mort tragique', Thanatos classique, pp. 59-93, which, while revealing little that was unknown since Lebegue, Rousset, and Forsyth, assembles a useful compendium of examples of the various physical facets of death, drawn mostly from pre-1650 works by minor dramatists (esp. Hardy); and W. D. Howarth, 'Some thoughts on the function of rhyme in French classical tragedy', Mourgues Vol., pp. 150-65, an interesting general discussion followed by more detailed analysis of rhyme schemes in the Berenice plays of Corneille and Racine. Articles noted on comedy are: P. Stewart, 'Les signes du comique', SRLF, 21:189-241, a sort of 'repertoire commente' of those features (themes, characters, linguistic and scenic devices) that define a play as comic, with examples drawn mainly from the 17th century (Moliere, Corneille, Regnard); P.J. Yarrow, 'Some aspects of the family and family life in some seventeenth-century French comedies', NSSCFS, 4:32-39, a well informed discussion drawing on a large number of plays; G. Forestier, 'La categorie des Comedies des comediens au XVIIe siecle', IL, 34:102-07, a supplement to its author's work on 'le theatre dans le theatre' (see YWMLS, 43:129), investigates 'le theatre sur le theatre' and discloses structural and thematic similarities which point to the dramatists' awareness of the generic specificity of their 'comedies des comediens'; M.-F. Hilgar, 'Mythomanie dramatique: le capitan matamore', FR, 56:250-56, unconvincingly proposes that modern psychiatric insights into mythomania are foreshadowed by the psychologically realistic (?) depiction of this recurrent figure in 17th century comedy; and C. Scherer, 'Doutes et hypotheses sur l'inter pretation du Capitan Matamore a Paris en 1635', RHT, 33, 1981 (1982) '.4.11-16, contests the theory that the roles of Taillebras in Mareschal's Le Railleur and Matamore in Corneille's LTllusion comique were composed specifically for Bellemore, and suggests they were explicable rather by the general evolution of comedy around that date. Several articles deal with practical questions of staging: T. Lawrenson, 'The "decor simultane": some recent Anglo-Saxon (and other) attitudes', Barnwell Vol., pp. 31-40, an authoritative etatpresent, sketching out the development of views on the functioning of the multiple setting and recent theories on the symbolism of the places represented; R. C. Knight, 'Ces funestes lieux: prison-scenes in the "decor simultane"', NSSCFS, 4:48-52, makes interesting deductions about the siting of the prison on the stage, from evidence in the Memoire de Mahelot and contemporary plays; P.J. Gethner, 'The staging of prayer in French theatre of the seventeenth century', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:21-36, highlights the problem of distinguishing between sacred and profane space for dramatists working within the convention of the unity of place, and finds the perfect solution in</page><page sequence="31">The Seventeenth Century 127 Racine's Athalie; G. Le Coat, 'Mimique de l'acteur et du musicien: reflexion sur la theorie classique de 1'expression corporelle en France', ib., 179-211, with the aid of nine illustrations makes the case that 'la theorie classique de l'expression corporelle passe par la peinture'; and M. Clermont, 'L'acteur et son jeu au XVIIe siecle: ses rapports avec le personnage qu'il represente', RHT, 33, 1981 (1982): 379-88, shows that the development of acting styles during the century reflected the general movement of dramatic literature towards greater verisimili tude. Finally, on performers: Georges Mongredien and Jean Robert, Les Comediens franqais du XVIT siecle: dictionnaire biographique, suivi d'un inventaire des troupes (1590-1710), d'apres des documents inedits, 3rd ed., CNRS, 1981, 329 pp. + 16 pi., is an extensively revised and considerably enlarged edition of this indispensable work; and D. Jones, 'Du nouveau sur Francoise Raisin', RHT, 34:199-203, adds further biographical details on this famous actress from unpublished documents. d'aubignac Two complementary articles focus on an important aspect of A.'s dramatic theory: Y. Hagiwara, 'La theorie de la representation dans La Pratique du Theatre de d'Aubignac', ELLF, no. 40:23-43, attentively examines the implications of his distinction between stage representation and action represented for such ques tions as the relationship between spectator and spectacle and between Tagreable' and 'le vraisemblable'; and T. Murray, 'Non-representa tion in La Pratique du theatre', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:57-74, relates A.'s precepts to modernist theories of dramatic representation and finds in his denial of 'mimetic re-presentation' and his endorsement of 'imaginative non-representation' evidence that his treatise is 'more modern than classical'. beys. G. J. Mallinson, 'L'Hospital des Fous of Charles Beys: the madman and the actor', FS, 36:12-25, identifies the assumption of another's identity (a characteristic of both lunatics and protagonists) as the unifying theme of this tragicomedy, which thus reflects the preoccupation of 1630s drama with the theatre itself. boursault. E. A. Marlow, 'Le Mercure Galant de Boursault: une heureuse imitation des Fdcheux de Moliere', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:213-32, successfully reappraises the interest and originality of B.'s neglected play which, far from servilely imitating Moliere, is shown to prefigure the satirical comedies of Lesage and Dancourt. p. corneille. A major reassessment is Han Verhoeff, Les grandes tragedies de Corneille: une psycholecture (ALM, 201), 160 pp., a vigorous and stimulating essay which extends to Le Cid, Horace, Cinna, and Polyeucte the method recently employed in reading the comedies (see YWMLS, 41:111), with generally similar conclusions; inspired by Mauron and Souriau, close analyses of'le Heros', 'les Homines', and</page><page sequence="32">128 French Studies 'la Femme' contradict modern critical assumptions by highlighting the passiveness and pessimism of the hero and the aggressiveness and alienation of the heroine. Mary Jo Muratore, *The Evolution of the Cornelian Heroine (Studia humanitatis), M, Jose Porrua Turanzas, 158 pp. Comedy continues to attract increasing attention. Robert Garapon, Le premier Corneille: de Melite a I'Illusion comique, SEDES, 169 pp., is an introductory study on traditional lines, with short chapters on background, genesis, dramatic structure, themes, style, and tone ? all competently done, and with useful discussion of the influence of L'Astree on the young C, but coverage of individual plays is very uneven. Corneille comique: Nine Studies of Pierre Corneille's Comedy with an Introduction and a Bibliography, ed. Milorad R. Margitic (PFSCL, Biblio 17, 4), 222 pp., is a well-balanced collection of four general studies and five devoted to single plays, with an introductory review of critical trends (9-13), and a valuable 'Bibliographical Guide (1633-1980)' (185-213), listing 435 items. The studies are: H. Verhoeff, 'Le don chez Corneille' (15-34), applies modern psychoanalytical and structuralist theory in a stimulating examina tion of the recurrent theme of a male character relinquishing the woman he loves; H.C. Knutson, 'Corneille's early comedies: varia tions in comic form' (35-54), studies his experimentation with, and increasing mockery of, established conventions of the comic genre in exposition and denouement scenes; R. Guichemerre, 'Le personnage du rival perfide dans les premieres comedies de Pierre Corneille' (55-74), illuminates the often ingenious and subtle variations by which C. constantly renews his treatment of a comic type, from the archetypal Eraste to his eventual transfiguration in Alidor, the 'rival de soi-meme'; M.-O. Sweetser, 'De la comedie a la tragedie: le "change" et la conversion de Melite a Polyeucte' (75-90), interprets psychological instability in the early comedies and the process of depassement in the tragedies with happy ending as facets of an 'esthetique du mouvement' that informs both genres; H. R. Allen tuch, 'Corneille, Melite, and the comedy of narcissism' (91-105), a study of the male protagonists (a 'trio of narcissists'), shows the typically Cornelian theme of self-esteem to receive a comic and at times mock-heroic treatment; C.B. Kerr, 'Corneille, Moliere et le comique de l'amour absolu' (107-28), uncovers in La Place Royate and Le Misanthrope numerous striking similarities at the levels of structure, ideas, and characterization, and finds in Angelique a 'sceur d'Al ceste'; R. Albanese, Jr, 'Modes de theatralite dans L'lllusion comique' (129-49), elaborates on the familiar interpretation of this play as a meditation on dramatic art; J. D. Lyons, 'Discourse and authority in Le Menteur' (151-68), is an original and enlightening study of four types of discursive authority in the play, which argues that the two</page><page sequence="33">The Seventeenth Century 129 referential types, 'empiricism' and 'nobility', associated with other male characters, are ignored by Dorante, whose progress towards integration in Parisian society is ensured by his success in applying to one non-referential type, 'urbanity', skills acquired in practicing another, 'textuality'; and A. D. Sellstrom, 'Comedy in Theodore and beyond' (169-83), justifies its unexpected inclusion by showing how C.'s reluctance to avoid scandalizing his audience results paradoxi cally in an aesthetic impurity which situates the play on the verge of comedy. Articles noted on general topics are: G. J. Mallinson, 'The variants of Corneille's early plays', MLR, 77:547-57, a careful study of emendations in the 1644 text of the comedies which reveals a shift of emphasis towards an increased dramatic seriousness and psychologi cal sensitivity that reflect the general evolution in C.'s comedies between Melite and La Place Royale; M. Bertaud, 'Corneille, homme de son temps: le theme de l'inconstance dans Melite et Clitandre\ IL, 34:6-11, covers familiar ground in noting parallels between C.'s representation of the instability of man's condition and views expressed by contemporary moral and religious writers (Justus Lipsius, Camus, P. de Lancre, Caussin); H. Stone, 'Transformal closures in Le Cid, Horace, Cinna, and Polyeucte', TJ, 34:302-21, a pretentious formal analysis, purports to reveal that 'antonymic relations in Le Cid are reconstructed in terms of paradigm in Horace, cycle in Cinna, and concentric orders in Polyeucte'; and M. J. Muratore, 'Aphorism as discursive weaponry: Corneille's language of amuni tion', EsC, 22, no. 3:19-27, in a style contrasting with the lapidary clarity of the examples cited, construes the maxim as 'front-line artillery' employed by heroes who allegedly manipulate the spoken word as a repressive force. A number of papers are devoted to individual plays: P. Larthomas, 'Le premier Clitandre: notes sur la dramaturgic et le style de Corneille', Barnwell Vol., pp. 41-50, evaluates the qualities of the 1632 version, and comments percep tively on the alternation of'open' and 'closed' settings; I. McFarlane, 'A reading of La Veuve', Mourgues Vol., pp. 135-49, offers a detailed and penetrating analysis of the relations between language and feeling, addressing the crucial problem of how genuine sentiment may be conveyed in a play which stresses the equivocity of language; C. Smith, 'Towards coherence in comedy: Corneille's Le Menteur', Barnwell Vol., pp. 63-74, discusses the substantial modifications that C. effected to his Spanish model and to the type of comedy represented by his own LTllusion comique; M. Kowsar, Tn defense of desire: Chimene's role in Le Cid reconsidered', TJ, 34:289-301, inspired by Kristeva's observations on the censure of desire in Western woman, reappraises Chimene's role in terms of'a dissenting attitude' which, by asserting the primacy of desire, challenges the 5</page><page sequence="34">130 French Studies dominant values of patriarchal society; A. Niderst, 'Le meurtre de Camille et le jugement d'Horace: reflexions sur l'esthetique cor nelienne', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 103-09, provides a neat explanation of C.'s ambivalent attitude to history in Horace by positing a conception of his tragedy as simultaneously political and religious; A. Georges, 'L'evolution morale d'Auguste dans Cinna\ IL, 34:86-94, presents a case for considering Auguste's act of clemency as the culmination of a long moral transformation brought about by divine grace; O. de Mourgues, 'Coherence and incoherence in Cinna\ Barn well Vol., pp. 51-62, takes a refreshing look at the unmotivated rever sals, viewed in relation to the play as a complex orchestration of conflicting values rather than an exercise in psychological verisimili tude, and provides an unusually sympathetic reading of the role of Cinna; J. Cairncross, 'Polyeucte: a flawed masterpiece', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:571-90, is similarly concerned with the under-motivated 'trans mogrification' of C.'s characters, considered here as a blemish attri butable to the incompatibility of the hero's other-worldly precepts and the aristocratic, this-worldly (and more typically Cornelian) ethos that imbues the pagan romance. A comparable approach is taken by A. Georges, 'Pourquoi Theodore de Corneille echoua-t-elle? Etude sur les personnages Chretiens de la piece', RHT, 33, 1981 (1982): 389-410, who forcefully demonstrates C.'s failure to integrate the Christian and pagan elements, and attributes the play's failure on stage to its ensuing ambiguity; on the other hand, G. Jondorf, 'Beauty and coherence in Montchrestien and Corneille', Mourgues Vol., pp. 117-34, demonstrates C.'s superior coherence in a subtle and detailed analysis of the theme of beauty in La Reine d'Escosse and Theodore; M. Simon, 'Rodogune en 1660', Actes . . . (Caen), pp. 111-20, notes that neither the textual modifications in the 1660 edition nor C.'s comments on the play in theoretical writings published that year made any significant concession to the evolution of taste between 1645 and 1660; M. O. Hivnor, 'Name as a basis for action in Corneil le's Heraclius\ RoN, 22:313-17, is a slight piece on the eponymous hero's self-revelation and efforts to merit his name; and C. Gossip, 6Tite et Berenice: a coherent comedie heroiqueV, Barnwell Vol., pp. 115-26, compares this play with three others similarly designated (Don Sanche, Pulcherie, Moliere's Dom Garde) and makes a sound case for its reclas sification as a tragedy. See also under tristan l'hermite below. t. corneille. H. G. Hall, 'Verisimilitude and aesthetic coher ence in Thomas Corneille's Timocrate', ib., pp. 92-98, submits that the play receives its coherence from an idealized view of love and honour which, reflecting heroic aspiration rather than the norms of observ able behaviour, binds Act v to the preceding action. Ariadne, a tragedy in five acts by Thomas Corneille (1672), re-created in English by Oscar</page><page sequence="35">The Seventeenth Century Mandel, Gainesville, Florida U.P., xii + 83 pp., contains an essay, 'Ariadne and French classical tragedy', pp. 45-83, giving an account of its stage history and assessment of its roles and tragic vision, but marred by extravagantly advantageous comparisons with P. Corneille and Racine. cyrano de bergerac. La Mort d'Agrippine, ed. C. J. Gossip (Textes litteraires, 44), Exeter U.P., xxiv + 91 pp., a welcome addition to a useful series, provides the text of the first edition of 1654 with variants, notes, and an Introduction which highlights the tragedy's (often contested) dramatic qualities and situates it firmly in the classical tradition. J. Dejean, 'Cyrano de Bergerac's Le Pedantjoue: play or word play?', Neophilologus, 66:167-78, is an excellent study of the 'bookishness' of a comedy which, it is argued, was a 'play-to-be read', withheld from the stage by its author. See also under tristan l'hermite below. du ryer. Esther, ed. Perry Gethner and Edmund J. Campion (Textes litteraires, 47), Exeter U.P., xxi + 96 pp., is a competent critical edition which supplies the text of 1644, supported by brief notes, commentaries, glossary, and an Introduction which, by underlining the importance of politics and generosite in this biblical (though by no means religious) tragedy, suggests its closer kinship with Cinna and Polyeucte than with Racine's version of 1689. helye garel. D. Courant, 'La Sophonisbe de Garel', Poesie Angevine, pp. 75-87, is a pleasant surprise since G.'s Sophonisbe (1607) had long been thought lost. Using a copy from the municipal library of Bordeaux, concentrates on the unusual metaphysical dimension that this 4,700-line tragedy gains from G.'s departures from the traditional presentation of Massinisse and Sophonisbe. hardy. A. Stegmann, 'Unite et diversite formelles dans l'ceuvre d'Alexandre Hardy', Barnwell Vol., pp. 18-30, inventories sources, subjects, recurrent themes, dramatic patterns and stylistic features, from all of which, despite an emphasis on putative Italian borrow ings, there emerges an overwhelming impression of diversity rather than the elusive unity sought. mareschal. G. J. Mallinson, 'Mareschal's Le Railleur: topicality and the search for the comic', NSSCFS, 4:40-47, reveals that this comedy, though generally noted for its realistic portrayal of Parisian society, explores a series of subtle interactions between reality and fantasy. moliere. An excellent study is W. D. Howarth, Moliere: A Playwright and his Audience, CUP, xiii + 325 pp., whose approach is to set M.'s works against their theatrical, social, and intellectual background; stresses the influence of the more cultured members of M.'s public, whose tastes and values are linked to the concepts of</page><page sequence="36">132 French Studies character comedy and 'le rire dans Tame', and reflected in the portrayal of raisonneurs (by and large, exponents of honnetete) and certain comic protagonists ('honnetes gens manques'). Nathan Gross, From Gesture to Idea: Esthetics and Ethics in Moliere's Comedy, N.York, Columbia U.P., x 4 159 pp., submits that in M.'s theatre aesthetic devices guide the spectator's reactions to the ethical values both of his own culture and of the protagonists' ? a view developed in five essays on 'Mortification and Charity in Le Tartuffe', 'Obligation in Dom Juan', 'Esthetics and Ethics in Le Misanthrope', 'Justice for George Dandin', and 'Values in Le Bourgeois gentilhomme'. J. H. Broome, Moliere: L'Ecole des femmes and Le Misanthrope (CGFT, 18), 83 pp., aimed at the non-specialist, provides a compact analysis of each play, focusing mainly on aspects of characterization and comic structure. Two complementary exercises in myth criticism are: M. Gutwirth, 'Moliere: un essai de mythocritique', Actes ... (N. Orleans), pp. 191-211, a stimulating study of the recurrent theme of a father handing over his daughter to a monster resembling himself, consi dered as a variant of the myth of Andromeda; and J. Dunmore, 'Moliere and the myth of Psyche', NZJFS, 3:5-19, posits this myth as the archetypal model for M.'s representation of love, most convin cingly in Amphitryon, Le Medecin malgre lui, and Le Cocu imaginaire, though also in other comedies. K. Robra, 'Moliere ? rebellion ou conformite? (a propos d'une controverse toujours renaissante)', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:233-36, will leave the controversy still raging since no new evidence accompanies the claim of M.'s adherence to a radical philosophy ('une sorte de "democratisation"') masked by a confor mity dictated by political caution. M. Gutwirth, 'Moliere and the Woman Question: Les Precieuses ridicules, L'Ecole des femmes, Les Femmes savantes', TJ, 34:345-59, fails to find a coherent view in M., and proposes a few questionable ones of his own. J. Hubert, 'Moliere: the playwright as protagonist', ib., 361-71, explores with limited success the 'metadramatic' dimension of plays (notably Les Precieuses ridicules and Le Bourgeoisgentilhomme) in which protagonists are held to 'assume authorial functions' and 'the comedy appears to unfold in constant relationship with a more or less occulted or sunken script'. J. Berkowitz, 'The where and the wherefore: a study of spaciality in Moliere's theater', FrF, 7 .'37-45, discusses the interest of the spacial relations either explicit in the text or inferred from it as a symbolic or 'signifying' feature in M.'s comedies. H. C. Knutson, 'A note on Socratic questioning in Moliere', RoN, 23:159?63, finds only a few (brief and generally abortive) echoes of the ironic, Socratic style of questioning, the rejection of which is attributed to its incompatibility with the air of spontaneous wit sought by M. A large number of studies have been devoted to single plays. J. Veyrin-Forrer, 'A la</page><page sequence="37">The Seventeenth Century 133 recherche des Precieuses', BBib: 287-320, a piece of meticulous biblio graphical research, examines numerous copies dated 1660, and demonstrates conclusively that the textual variants do not signify separate editions of the play, as has been supposed, but are simply 'variantes de presse' introduced during hasty printing by several teams of compositors. P. Hampshire, 'Introduction to Moliere's UEcole des Femmes', ML, 63:215-21, is a judicious general study incorporating views expressed in its author's (i.e. P. H. Nurse's) Classical Voices (London, Harrap, 1971); J. F. Gaines, 'UEcole des femmes: usurpation, dominance, and social closure', PFSCL, no. 17:607-25, a mainly successful 'socio-critical scrutiny', considers Arnolphe as a representative of the wealthy landowning middle classes vainly seeking dignity and 'social ascension'; and B.Johnson, 'Teaching ignorance: L'Ecole des Femmes', YFS, no. 63:165-82, though partly concerned with modern pedagogical problems, offers pertinent comment on the process of teaching and learning in the play. C. Lindsay, 'Moliere in the post-structuralist age: LTmpromptu de Versailles', TJ, 34:373-83, tiresomely celebrates the play's 'critical "coming of age"' as 'a post-structuralist piece de resistance' staging 'some of the major tenets of post-structuralist criticism'. A. A. Ciccone, 'Structures of communication and the comic in Moliere's Le Mariageforce', Neophilologus, 66:43-48, reads this farce as a statement about the nature of communication and analyses verbal exchanges in which Sganarelle's 'verbal frustration' is judged to be a principal source of humour. W.J. Beck, 'Tartuffe ? La fouine de Seville ou simplement une belette de La Fontaine', RHT, 34:204?10, is yet another version of an article first published in English (see YWMLS, 42:136-37, and 43:134). M. Defrenne, 'Une unite scenique: la "remontrance" dans le Dom Juan de Moliere', SFr, 26, no. 78:408-25, is a well-ordered analysis of the content, structure, positioning, etc., of 13 instances of recriminatory dialogue involving Don Juan which contribute to the play's coherence; J.-M. Apostolides, 'L'or et le feu: une lecture du Dom Juan de Moliere', Actes... (N. Orleans), pp. 249-68, regards these two elements, united in Don Juan's 'vetement rouge et dore', as emblems of incompatible theological and mercantile values whose rejection and espousal are incarnated by the hero of this modern myth ? a subjective reading which combines occasional insights with gratuitous extrapolations and a questionable socio historical 'conclusion'; its more extravagant aspects are challenged in an accompanying 'Commentaire' by R. Albanese, pp. 269-74 (Apos tolides's article also appears as 'Dom Juan alchimiste: l'or et le feu', Litterature, no. 47:3?11). A more solidly based sociocritical study is L. Gossman, 'Moliere's Misanthrope: melancholy and society in the age of the Counterreformation', TJ, 34:323-43, which sets the play against</page><page sequence="38">134 French Studies the contemporary shift in the value and meaning attached to melancholy, now reproved as a mark of potential political dissidence, though at the same time, as M.'s disabused picture of salon society suggests, it was also generated by court life; D. F. Jones, 'Love and friendship in he Misanthrope', RoN, 23:164-69, notes the ironic contrast running through the play between eros, depicted here as a negative force, and philia, shown as the highest form of human love. Two articles on George Dandin seek to restore to the play the comic perspective recently denied by producers and critics: N. A. Peacock, 'The comic ending of George Dandin', FS, 36:144-53, stresses the ludic atmosphere of the final three scenes, in which the self-dramatization of Dandin is viewed as part of a sustained parody of traditional (esp. tragic) denouements; and T. Malachy, 'George Dandin: un person nage comique malgre lui', LR, 36:287-93, sees Dandin as a victim of self-delusion whose comic error is a yearning for identity and recognition (even through cuckoldry), and who thus shares with many of M.'s comic figures an 'incapacity ontologique de discerner d'une maniere clairvoyante ce qui les concerne'. R. McBride, 'The triumph of ballet in Le Bourgeois gentilhomme', Barnwelt Vol., pp. 127-41, argues persuasively that its triumph is one of form over content, since the prosaic bourgeois revealed by the comedy is 'transmuted by ballet into the very life-force of his lightest and gayest comedie-ballet'. W. D. Howarth, '"Une piece comique tout a fait achevee": aesthetic coherence in Les Femmes savantes', ib., pp. 142-55, is an admirable reassessment of a play whose distinctively literary quality and lack of comic focus or stature are both attributed to M.'s concession to the tastes of the 'honnetes gens' (see also this writer's monograph, detailed above); R. W. Herzel, 'Problems in the original casting of Les Femmes Savantes', Actes ... (N. Orleans), pp. 215-31, reasonably infers from a study of the composition of M.'s troupe between the play's conception and first performance that M.'s text underwent substan tial revisions, and speculates upon the extent and nature of these changes; these theories are debated, and counter-hypotheses prop osed, in accompanying commentaries by M.-F. Hilgar, pp. 233-36, E. Henein, pp. 237-40, and J. F. Gaines, pp. 241-48. H. T. Barnwell, Moliere: Le Malade imaginaire (CGFT, 12), 76 pp., offers a vigorous and refreshing reading which plays down the malade and other common focuses of critical attention (autobiography, satire, moral didactic ism, psychological realism) and stresses the coherence and centrality of the comic representation of the imaginaire', E. Fichet-Magnan, 'Argan et Louison: Moliere, l'enfant et la mort', RZLG, 6:306-21, is a solid study of the themes of childhood and death in Le Malade imaginaire, aided by the seminal studies of P. Aries. Finally, several articles are devoted to M.'s plays in performance: R. LePage, 'Brian</page><page sequence="39">The Seventeenth Century 135 Bedford's Tartuffe: the erotic violence of hypocrisy', TJ, 34:389-96, justifies the highlighting of M.'s 'erotic subtext'; M.-F. Hilgar, 'Modern and post-modern interpretations of Tartuffe\ ib., 384-88, on the lessons of two contrasting productions in 1980 (another version of the article appears as 'Tartuffe, Tartuffe toujours recommence: les mises en scene de 1980', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:153-62); and J.-P. Collinet, 'Avatars de Dom Juan', IL, 34:12-22, a well-documented account of major interpretations of M.'s play. See also under boursault and p. corneille above, and under rotrou below. montchrestien. C. A. M. Wooding, 'Montchrestien's variants and the theme of deceit', BHR, 44:521-32, discovers that, despite shortening his plays in the 1601 and 1604 editions, M. significantly increased his references to the theme of deception, thereby aligning himself with contemporary dramatists who were displaying an increasing fascination for this topic. See also under p. corneille above. racine. Jacques Scherer, Racine et/ou la ceremonie (Litteratures modernes, 30), PUF, 237 pp., commends itself less for the notion of 'ceremonie', employed as an analytical instrument in a three-part investigation of the tragic, dramatic, and poetic aspects of R.'s art, than for a series of close textual readings that offer fresh perceptions and emphases ? most notably by calling into question the fatalistic, metaphysical dimension of 'le tragique racinien'. Eleonore M. Zimmermann, La liberte et le destin dans le theatre de Jean Racine. Suivi de deux essais sur le theatre de Jean Racine (SFIS, 24), Saratoga, Anma Libri, 200 pp., sheds new light on a much-discussed topic by combining a perceptive close analysis of individual plays with the elucidation of the evolving relationship in R.'s theatre between the desire for order and the quest for freedom. The two supplementary essays had been published separately in 1968 and 1979 (see YWMLS, 30:99-100, and 41:115). Norah K. Drown, Jean Racine: Meditations on his Poetic Art, xii + 180 pp., concerned mainly with the precision and imaginative power of R.'s language, provides an enthusiastic initiation for the non-specialist, with several sensitive commentaries on selected scenes and passages. M. McGowan, 'Racine's "lieu theatral"', Barnwell Vol., pp. 166-86, is an enlightening expose, which demonstrates the import ance of his spectators' familiarity with the place of the dramatic action, particularly for the cultivation of an allusive style. P. Allen, 'The role of myth in Racine: Andromaque, Iphigenie, Phedre\ Steele Vol., pp. 93-116, shows that a powerful source of dramatic interest and conflict in these plays derives from R.'s exploration of the interaction between purely human values and reactions and the mythic element (identified here as Troy, sacrifice, and incest respectively) whose neglect and rejection or comprehension and assimilation by indi vidual characters is the subject of detailed analysis. Several articles</page><page sequence="40">136 French Studies this year are devoted to the study of one of five favoured plays. I. McFarlane, 'Reflections on the variants in Andromaque', Barnwell Vol., pp. 99-114, carefully analyses the effects of R.'s emendations, both major (in Act v) and minor, especially for the psychological coher ence, thematic structure and overall significance of the play; A. A. Ciccone, 'Proper names in rhyming couplets in Racine's Andromaque', RoN, 23:22-28, rewards progression beyond its overblown theoreti cal preamble with some brief, apposite observations on the dramatic significance of rhymes involving the names of Hector, Troy, and the four protagonists; J. Moravcevich, 'Literary, sociological and psychological sources of Andromaque', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:641-54, briefly summarizes others' views on these sources, but adds nothing new. C. Abraham, 'Tristan and Racine: anxiety in Osman and Bajazef, ZFSL, 92:1-8, makes an interesting comparison, showing how R. enriched T.'s dramatic legacy by reinforcing the 'social anxiety' (or estrangement between characters) common to both plays with a 'spacial anxiety' unique to Bajazet; C. Spencer, 'Bajazet: la personne interposee ou la derobade', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:253-69, offers a subtle exploration of the relationship of visibility/invisibility and speech/silence with the exercise of power, which casts an interesting light on the roles of Acomat and Atalide. J. Dubu, 'Iphigenie, ou la mort acceptee', Barnwell Vol., pp. 156-65, identifies the acceptance of death as the play's major theme, and subtly analyses the contrasting attitudes of the three younger characters on the one hand, and of their three elders on the other; B. Magne, 'L'ironie dans Iphigenie de Racine', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:237-52, is an excellent study in the modernist idiom of four instances of irony, with an exhaustive analysis of their 'fonctionnement semantique et pragmatique' and useful distinctions between mimetic, dramatic, and tragic irony; J.-P. Collinet, 'Racine et ses personnages invisibles: le cas d'Iphigenie', Mourgues Vol., pp. 176-92, shows how the sustained evocation of off stage individuals and groups lends the play affinities with the novel, historical drama, and more especially the epic and the opera. H. G. Hall, 'A propos de Phedre: quatre schemas mythologiques', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 91-97, illustrates the richness of the play's mythological texture by approaching R.'s use of myth from four divergent viewpoints that are shown to be ultimately complementary ? the ornamental, euhermeristic, syncretistic, and demonological; C. Delmas, 'Poesie et folklore d'apres la Phedre de Racine', CLitDsS, 4:41-56, elaborates on Hall's fourth schema by proposing that contemporary belief in magic and the supernatural provided Tins trument de la captation et de l'actualisation de la fable antique'; M. Black, 'Myth, folklore and character in Shakespeare and Racine', Mourgues Vol., pp. 166-75, deals with clusters of metaphors drawn from</page><page sequence="41">The Seventeenth Century 137 classical myth in Phedre and from Northern folklore in Macbeth, and compares their use in each play as instruments of the characters' self revelation; A. G. Branan, 'Dramatis res and couleur mythologique in Racine's Phedre1, RoN, 23:29-33, explains convincingly how R.'s treatment of Phedre's poison, Hippolyte's sword, and Neptune's monster evokes Medea, Aegeus, and the young Theseus, and thereby anchors his version all the more firmly and vividly in ancient myth; P. France, 'Myth and modernity: Racine's Phedre', Steele Vol., pp. 227-42, challengingly questions the significance of the recent emphasis on myth for a modern public; O. Classe, 'En quelle situation? Some notes on the end of Racine's Phedre', NSSCFS, 4:53 59, discusses sources of ambiguity in a fifth act which ends with 'order' undermined and guilt attaching to all of the characters; K.J. Phillips, 'Enclosing designs in Racine's Phedre', RR, 73:411-20, is a contrived discusion of the labyrinth image and of words with double meaning, which claims that the play traces the completed love act many times, including once within the 'labyrinthine body' of the sea monster (!); E. L. Berg, 'Impossible representation: a reading of Phedre', ib., 421-37, is a polemical piece which aims to persuade that a 'phallocentric critical tradition' in which 'Phedre has always been read through the eyes of Hippolyte' needs to be counterbalanced by an assertively feminist reading of the play as 'an interrogation of how a woman might represent (or expose) herself. R. Knight, 'Medita tions on Athalie', Barnwell Vol., pp. 187-99, comments knowledgeably on the perfecting of features that had been new in Esther, especially the Greek-style choruses. Lastly, Theatre complet: 1, La Thebaide, Alexandre le Grand, Andromaque, Les Plaideurs, Britannicus, Berenice, ed. Jean-Pierre Collinet (Folio, 1412), Gallimard, 527 pp., with notes, principal variants from pre-1697 editions, a preface relating the evolution of R.'s career, and 'notices' on the history and reception of each play. regnard. Gifford P. Orwen, Jean-Franqois Regnard (TWAS, 585), 131 pp., is a competent general study in the familiar format of the series, with chapters on biography, poetry, and the Voyages, but with most space devoted to a synopsis and brief discussion of each of his plays; short concluding chapters assess the individual quality of his work with regard to character types, contemporary manners and comic style, and compare his aims and achievements with those of Moliere. rotrou. P. Pelckmans, 'Le reve apprivoise: notes sur le theme onirique dans le theatre de Jean Rotrou', 57V, 54:129-40, is an unavailing attempt to read R.'s mainly anodine treatment of this minor theme in the light of modern psychoanalytic theory. D. A. Watts, 'Rotrou's problematical tragedies', Barnwell Vol., pp. 75-91, a most welcome and well-balanced reassessment of R.'s eight tragedies,</page><page sequence="42">i38 French Studies charting step by step his uneven and often halting progress between 1634 and 1648 towards 'convincing tragic form and vision'. G. Forestier, Tronie et deguisement chez Rotrou: une richesse de moyens exemplaire', PFSCL, 9, no. 17:553-70, successfully applies concepts of modern semiology to UHeureux Naufrage, revealing both the variety of forms taken by irony and its relation to the theme of disguise. A. Gendre, 'Le Jupiter de Rotrou et Moliere ou le scandale justifie', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 177-85, is a penetrating comparison of the Amphitryon plays of Plautus, R. (Les Sosies) and M., with a good analysis of their use of the 'jeu des miroirs'. M. A. Barnett, 'The inverse world of French tragicomedy', FR, 55:350-57, treating Laure persecutee as typical of the period c. 1625-50, studies the 'unreal' world of confusion, chaos and grief, considered as an inverted image of a 'real' world of symmetry, order and happiness which is ultimately reestablished at the denouement. R.J. Melpignano, 'La S&amp;ur dejean Rotrou devant la critique', PFSCL, 9, no. 16:271-82, a sketchy etat present, which concentrates on literary sources, comic quality, and the role of Ergaste. g. de scudery. See under tristan l'hermite below. tristan l'hermite. CTH, 4, is devoted to 'Tristan et le theatre', and has five mainly brief but varied articles. R. Guichemerre, 'A propos de La Mort de Seneque: les tragedies de la conjuration' (5-14), discusses T.'s play alongside three others from the period 1635-47 (Scudery's La Mort de Cesar, Corneille's Cinna, and Cyrano's La Mort d'Agrippine) which all share the theme of conspiracy against a Roman emperor, and shows that together they constitute 'une veritable typologie de la tragedie de la conjuration'. D. Dalla Valle,' "Son nom seul est reste" (La Mariane, v. 1751)' (15-17), notes that all elements of the denouement, including Herode's schizophrenic 'dedoublement de son moi', are prepared by his prophetic dream in Act 1. A. Mansau, 'Ariste et la sage folie' (18-23), traces analogies between La Folie du Sage, Hamlet, and Calderon's La vida es sueno, but argues that T.'s play differs ultimately in meaning from the others since 'Tristan analyse la solitude de ses heros devant des noiceurs et des tempetes symboli ques'. C. Abraham, 'Jeu et verite dans Le Parasite9 (24-29), demons trates that it is from a farcical mixture of these two elements that T.'s play, with its characters who are both creators and victims of illusion, derives its comic force. N. Bonvalet, 'Tristan L'Hermite et John Webster: essai de rapprochement' (30-36), reveals their similar sensibilities and techniques in a brief enumeration of common elements in their works, then analyses at greater length parallels in the depiction of two exemplary female characters: Vittoria in The White Devil, and Epicaris in La Mort de Seneque.
