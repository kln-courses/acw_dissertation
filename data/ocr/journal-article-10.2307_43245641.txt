<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Blackfriars 398 CONCEPTS OF GOD IN AFRICA, by John S. Mbitl. S.P.C.K. , London, 1970. 348 pp. 60s. Generally speaking, African religions have never quite managed to make much impression on outsiders. Possibly they are not spectacular enough and lack the great variety of colourful religious practices so characteristic of many other religions. So it seemed to Europeans that the 'Dark Continent' was thirsting for the religious light from Europe: for Christianity, which was preached with great success. The misleading factor here was, however, the apparent capacity of the African peoples to incorporate many foreign elements within their own basic patterns of thought without being much affected in their thinking by the origins of these foreign elements. This has been revealed to us only r√®cently, among other things by the astonishing growth of the so- called African Independent Churches. So suddenly we hear a lot about adaptation, and everyone concerned is trying to get quickly the sort of information needed to present their ware in the disguise of genuine African images. The demand is so great that practically any- thing published in this field has no difficulty in finding a market. Professor Mbiti's book has the additional advantage that it is written by an African and cannot therefore be criticized on the grounds that the author does not know what he is talking about. In that sense this book is important, for it will be bought and even read by many and it will be a rich source for those would-be writers of adaptation- catechisms. The book is primarily written for students at universities and theological seminaries and gives them very encyclopaedic information about the religions of 270 African tribes. It seems odd to lump together so many tribes spread over such an enormous area, but this would still be excusable if the material were arranged according to the different tribes, so that each religion could speak for itself. The arrangement here is, however, according to themes, which are then illustrated with some information taken from the tribes that happen to have something to offer in that particular theme. In the first two parts of the book the author runs through all the notions connected with God, which one would find in any theo- logical manual of late western Christianity. On the whole the scheme seems to work quite well on these terms, and the author has little difficulty in forcing the African religions into some form of western monotheism. On the basis of material contained in the sections on God's Immanence and God's Unity and Plurality, for instance, the reader may still have his doubts about the success of this operation, but such problems are adequately dealt with in Part 3 of the book (Anthropomorphic and Natural Attributes of God), where spirits and natural phenomena are regarded as personifications or expressions of aspects of God. Of course, once you have decided for a certain idea of the divine, nothing is going to prevent you from saying things like that. You can always declare some religious expression an anthropomorphism as long as that particular religion does not get a chance to speak for itself. In the last part of the book (God and Man) information is given about man's religious behaviour and religious reflection upon his situation before God. We are not suggesting that the book cannot be fruitfully used by those who want to have some vague idea of the things people are doing and saying in African religions. But one should remember that Professor Mbiti presumably belongs to that school of scholars who believe that African religions can be looked at as if most of the fundamental notions of western Christianity are to be found in them. Naturally, one has to accept that the author as a Christian is entitled to believe that this point of view is true, but this does not necessarily mean that from the point of view of the African religions an adequate idea has been given.
