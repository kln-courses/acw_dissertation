Selected from the collections of New York's Museum of Primitive Art, the 150 outstanding objects in the show will be installed in the Morton Wing. While all of these works of art are grouped under the general (and often disputed) classification of "primitive art," one is struck first of all by the almost overwhelming sense of stylistic diversity which marks their particular characteristics. Basically the objects are divided into the three great cultural areas of Africa, the Americas and Oceania, though within these gen- eral categories we can identify about 75 individual groups. Even within these cultural sub-groupings the differences can be vast, especially if, for example, we compare the essential and basic life style of the Aus- tralian aborigine to the erudite and highly developed culture of the Maya who once flourished in Mexico Opposite page Shield Oceania, Melanesia, Solomon Islands Left: Housepost Figure Oceania, Polynesia, Maori On the front cover Seated Mother and Child Figure Africa, Mali, Bougouni District, Bambara All pieces from The Museum of Primitive Art, New York The Bulletin of The Art Institute of Chicago is published six times yearly in January, March, May, July, September and November by the Art Institute, S.

Chronologically the cultures repre- sented in the exhibition are also widely separated, dat- ing from as early as 1200 B.c. up to and including our present century. This sense of wide differentiation is also reflected in the materials used in the creation of these works of art which range from wood, stone, ivory, pottery, textiles and painted objects, to bronze and gold. Despite these differences of geographic area, time and medium, upon closer examination this superb ag- gregation of objects begins to show elements of com- monality through which they can be more easily re- lated as a group. To begin with, we should notice that the large majority of the pieces are anthropomorphic- their form being derived from the human body or face. This common characteristic is conceptually tied to the fact that in almost every case, these works of art were created to fulfill a vital religious or social function within their respective cultures. While these objects were surely admired for their beauty, their pri- mary purpose was to form an intrinsic element in the world view of their creators which was reflective of the ideal harmonious balance between man and his world, both spiritual and actual. Even though the works in this exhibition are separated from our culture by vast temporal, spatial and philosophical gaps, we, like other Westerners be- fore us, are attracted to them because of a visual ex- pressiveness which is evocative of their essential rela- tionship to both the forces of Nature and the spiritual Opposite page, left Female Half Figure, Africa, Zaire, Luba Opposite page, right Ceremonial Paddle Oceania, Polynesia, Easter Island world. As we come ever closer in our understanding of the spiritual climate within which these works were conceived our appreciation of their formal beauty will be significantly enhanced. Primitive Art Masterworks was jointly organized by the Museum of Primitive Art and The American Federation of Arts, New York. The exhibition and its fully-illustrated catalogue were supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
