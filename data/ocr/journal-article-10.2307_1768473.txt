<plain_text><page sequence="1">RILKE, MICHELANGELO, AND THE GESCHICHTEN VOM LIEBEN GOTT ROBERT J. CLEMENTS A FULL assessment of the spirit which infuses Rilke's thirteen Geschichten vom lieben Gott has never been undertaken. In fact, the copious studies, essays, and memoirs which caused Gide to observe as far back as February 1927, "Tout a ete dit sur Rainer Maria Rilke," have been less concerned with these somewhat enigmatic tales than with the other works. Despite the fact that they were written on seven successive nights in a single sustained impulse, they are not entirely homogeneous in spirit. Certainly, harmony is lent throughout by the reappearance of a gentle, anthropomorphic God of an enlightened sort who is baffled by that comportment of mankind which baffles the nar- rator himself. The successive titles of this collection announced God as a unifying force ("Du, mein Gott, wer sonst!"). Yet within this general and harmonizing spirit there is heterogeneity provided by "seltsame, oft bizarr wirkende Vergleiche und Bilder"1 which seem capricious in- ventions and reminiscences. It is our intention to identify the spirit and source of many of these passages. This spirit, implicit from the very first legend and finally explicit in the eighth, is that of Michelangelo Buonarroti. Two contrary formative forces operated on the composition of the Geschichten in November 1899, the same forces apparent in Vom m8nchischen Leben, dating from the same season and year. Between late March and early May 1898, Rilke made his first trip to Florence via Arco and Viareggio; he had been to Venice in the spring of the previous year. In April, May, and June of 1899 he made his first trip to Moscow, a trip which he felt would bring new depths of religiosity to his writing, as he wrote to Frieda von Builow, and one which would com- plement his stay in Florence.2 It was at the very moment when, with Lou Andreas-Salome, he was reconciling and synthesizing his in- tensive study of Russia and Russian with his specific study of the Ital- ian Renaissance and when the memories of his two recent trips were freshest that Rilke wrote these "children's stories." Three of them were actually set in Russia and three in Italy. The trip to Florence-to the Cappella Medicea, the Bargello, the Casa Buonarroti, and the rest-brought Rilke face to face with the plastic works of Michelangelo. His description of the Deposizione in the 1 Albert Schafer, Die Gottesanschauung Rainer Maria Rilkes (Wiirzburg, 1938), p. 38. 2 Rilke, Briefe und Tagebiicher aus der Friihzeit (Leipzig, 1931), p. 16.

Yet, as attested by the rapprochements we shall identify in the Geschichten, it was less the marbles, canvases, and frescoes of Michelangelo which absorbed Rilke in 1899 than the mind and tempera- ment of the Florentine artist as revealed in his writings and recorded statements. For in those writings, particularly the Rime and the Let- tere, Rilke found a fascinating fellow craftsman whose passionate tem- perament, whose unbending devotion to his art, and whose Christian- Platonic mysticism transcending penury and misunderstanding all struck a responsive chord in his own troubled being. Yet, of all the scholars and dilettantes represented in Walter Ritzer's Rilke Bibliogra- phie, none has explored the ascandancy of Buonarroti over Rene Rilke. In 1899, for the first time, it was possible for Rilke to have the five major sources for Michelangelo's thought at his disposal in readily available editions, editions which have never been superseded. That year, moreover, initiated a period when is was almost impossible for a young intellectual in Germany or Austria, especially if he had a read- ing knowledge of Italian, to avoid becoming acquainted with Michel- angelo. In 1899 a generous Sammlung of letters to Michelangelo was brought out in Berlin by Carl Frey. The monumental Milanesi edition of the artist's letters had been available since 1875. The final volume of Milanesi's edition of Vasari's Vite had appeared in 1882, and in 1887 Frey reissued in Berlin the biographies of Michelangelo by Vasari and Condivi. In 1897 Frey published in Berlin his definitive Dichtungen des Michelagniolo Buonarroti, whose readings were to be used later by Rilke in his own Dichtungen des Michelangelo. It should be added par- enthetically that in 1899 the few extant German translations of Michel- angelo were disparaged by Rilke as "ein Spiel kindischer Reimereien."3 He excepted from this condemnation only the few pieces which had been translated by Hermann Grimm, like Frey a professor of art at the Uni- versity of Berlin. Granted the opportune appearance of these four sources, the Rime, the Lettere, and the Vite of Vasari and Condivi, what access did Rilke have to the fifth major reservoir of Buonarrotian thought, those dialogues in which Francisco de Hollanda recorded so many of Michelangelo's pronouncements on art ? On the eve of the com- position of the Geschichten, Vasconcellos published in Vienna De Hol- landa's Vier Gesprdche iiber die Malerei (1899), with facing German and Portuguese texts. That Rilke preferred to use the Italian versions of the sources that were also available in German one gathers from his statement to Lou 3 Rilke, Briefe (Wiesbaden, 1950), II, 292. 219</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Andreas-Salome that he knew only the Italian text of the Rime.4 This is unexpectedly confirmed, moreover, in two verses of the first part of the Stundenbuch, also dating from late 1899: Das waren Tage Michelangelos Von denen ich in fremden Buichern las.5 These sources, all of them recently available to him and the vehicles of a Michelangelo revival, are reflected in varying degrees in several of the Geschichten vom lieben Gott. Perhaps still conscious of Michelangelo at that moment when he set down his pen, exhausted as though he had been wielding a chisel and mallet, Rilke signaled in his Tagebuch the completion of the "Buch vom lieben Gott und Anderes" with a free-verse acknowledgment of the divine forces which had buoyed him up night after night: die nicht von meiner miiden Hand sind. Die verraten, daB ich selber Hand bin, Eines, der mit mir wundersame Dinge tut.6 It is the same acknowledgment which Michelangelo on several occa- sions makes to the God who guides his hand. On one of these occasions he expressed himself in a sonnet which Rilke was shortly to translate: se '1 mie rozzo martello i duri sassi Forma d'uman aspecto or questo or quello, Dal ministro, che '1 guida iscorgie e tiello, prendendo il moto, ua con gli altrui passi.7 Wenn hier mein grober Hammer den und den hartesten Stein in Menschenhaftes wandelt, hat er den Schwung von dem, der mit ihm handelt und muB mit eines andern Schritten gehn.8 God as the sommo fattore, the actual force behind the "pronta mano" of the artist is an idea conveyed passim in Michelangelo's writings.9 If the spirit of Botticelli infuses many of the early Miidchenbilder, it is Michelangelo who is evoked directly or indirectly in six of the tales of God. In the first tale, "Das Mairchen von den Handen Gottes," the narrator announces at the outset that he knows something about these hands. In- deed, they were a prominent motif throughout Vom minchischen Leben, completed a few weeks earlier. Rilke leads us up to the subject as though he were enumerating the first histories of the Sistine Ceiling preceding the Creazione di Adamo: "Also der liebe Gott hegann, wie 4 Rilke, Briefe (Leipzig, 1933), III, 190. 5 Rilke, Gesammelte Werke (Leipzig, 1927), II, 193. 6 Rilke, Briefe und Tagebiicher aus der Friihzeit (Leipzig, 1931), p. 231. 7 Carl Frey, ed., Dichtungen des Michelagniolo Buonarroti (Berlin, 1897), p. 106. 8 Rilke, Dichtungen des Michelangelo (Wiesbaden, 1951), p. 42. 9 Frey, Dichtungen, pp. 4, 228 and passim. 220</page><page sequence="4">RILKE AND MICHELANGELO bekannt, seine Arbeit, indem er die Erde machte, diese vom Wasser un- terschied, und Licht befahl."'0 The rapidity of this creating ("in be- wundernswerter Geschwindigkeit") impresses Rilke, as it impressed Michelangelo in his sonnet, "Colui che fece et non di cosa alcuna" (in Rilke's Dichtungen this becomes "Der, welcher, nicht aus irgend einem Dinge").11 Rilke explains that this rapidity is possible only after long and deep planning; everything must be ready in the head before the hand can execute. This is a basic tenet of Michelangelo, who held that the mind must resolve the problem of the concetto with deliberation, so that the final operation may be (and appear to be) rapid and effortless. This Michelangelo confided to Francisco de Hollanda as a crucial trade secret: "Was man mit gr6otem Eifer erstreben und mit dem gr6Bten Aufwand von Arbeit und Studium, im SchweiBe seines Angesichts zu erreichen suchen soll, ist dasjenige, daB, was man mit allergr6Bter Miihe schafft, so aussehe, als ware es schnell, fast ohne Anstrengung, ja mit groBfter Leichtigkeit hingeworfen."'2 God is completely indifferent to external nature and takes no interest in creating trees. His disdain is reminiscent of Michelangelo's, as ex- plained by Vasari in a well-known passage: "Ha Michelagnolo atteso solo, come s'e detto altrove, alla perfezione dell'arte; perche ne paesi vi sono, ne alberi ... come quegli che forse non voleva abbassare quel suo grande ingegno in simil cose."'3 When God starts to make animals, He grows more interested; but He becomes completely absorbed in the making of man. The lack of interest in trees and animals is translated into the first histories of the Sistine Ceiling. Angels flutter around God, capable of fright, like the putti on the Sistine Creazioni. God turns the completion of the sculpturing of man over to His hands, and sight is no longer an agent of the formative process.14 We are thus guided to the Creazione di Adamo, where the hands impart life to man. The distinct functions of the mind and the hands were explicit in Michelangelo: "le mani operano e l'occhio giudica."'5 Man, however, slips out of God's hands and falls-the theme of three of the remaining five panels. God thereupon disowns his hands and even today, unless the hands have the succor of God, they are as powerless as art without nature. "Ohne Gott gibt es keine Vollendung."'1 This is a lesson Michelangelo will 10 Rilke, Geschichten vom lieben Gott (Leipzig, 1936), p. 11. 11 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 4; Rilke, Dichtungen, p. 32. 12 De Hollanda, Vier Gesprdche iiber die Malerei (Vienna, 1899), p. 121. 13 Vasari, Le Vite (Florence, 1881), VII, 216. 14 Geschichten, p. 15.

The idea that God is needed for the completion of man's works had recently been introduced in the Stundenbuch, where the efforts of the 221</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE learn bitterly in the eighth tale. The notion of the hands proving inade- quate to the task when the mind is inattentive was enunciated by Michel- angelo: "e' non si puo lavorare con le mani una cosa, e col ciervello una altra," or again, "si dipinge col ciervello e non con le mani."'7 At this point Rilke proceeds to one of the dominant ideas of Michel- angelo's aesthetics-the supremacy of the nude over the clothed figure. After a moment of eternity (a thousand calendar years) God looks down and sees a great milling throng of over a million. "Aber sie waren alle schon in Kleidern... so bekam Gott einen ganz falschen und sehr schlechten Begriff von den Menschen." Michelangelo's specific con- demnation of clothing Rilke may have found in the newly published Vier Gesprdche: "Wo aber ist ein Verstand so stumpfsinning, daB er nicht begriffe, da3 ein MenschenfulB edler ist als ein Schuh? Und die menschliche Haut sch6ner als ein Lammfell, mit dem man jene etwa bekleidet ?"18 Fortunately, there are a few people left in the world to remind God of the beauty of the nude figure: "Einfach die Kinder und dann und wann auch diejenigen Leute, welche malen, Gedichte schrei- ben, bauen," three pursuits in which Michelangelo distinguished him- self. Various of Buonarroti's Rime ("Mentre c'alla belta, ch'i' uiddi im prima," "Veggio nel tuo bel uiso, Signior mio," "Per ritornar la donde uenne fora") propagate the Neoplatonic belief that the human body con- stitutes one of three levels at which God is mirrored, the supreme per- fection of form, and a visible manifestation of "quel pietoso fonte, onde siam tucti" ("Gnadenquell, aus welchem alle stammen").19 This exaltation of the nude figure furnished the answer to the ques- tion implicit in the title of the third tale, "Warum der liebe Gott will, da13 es arme Leute gibt." God continues to regret that man clothes him- self so fully that He can no longer see what man is like. The loss of the contours of the body within the clothing ("daB man sah, es konnte kein Korper mehr darunter sein")20 which God regrets was equally intoler- able to Michelangelo. The most perfect example of his rebellion against raiment was one which Rilke had recently observed-the figure of Giuliano de' Medici, with the transparent coat of mail. The principal episode of this third tale concerns the erection of a nude statue of Truth in a public square. God finds the modeler of this statue, an irritable man, kneading clay and complaining that he should never have become an artist: "Ich wollte, ich war Schuster geworden. Da sitzt man und plagt sich."21 His complaint is a paraphrase of Michel- "Knappen, Jiinger, Meister" require the final collaboration of God: "Aber wer kann dich vollenden, du Dom ... ?"

The iracund sculptor (and testimony abounds concerning the short temper of Mi- chelangelo) works day and night to execute his allegorical figure, only to have the city fathers and other eminences decide that the pudenda should be covered. This scandalized reaction is a vivid evocation of Michelangelo's struggle to protect his nude figures from braghettoni -from dignitaries of the Church and Counter-Reformational bodies down to the vulgar Aretino, who wrote a "lettre de Tartuffe" (Romain Rolland's phrase) charging that the figures of the Sistine Chapel would be more fitting to a bordello. "Der liebe Gott verstand nicht, weshalb, so laut fluchte der Kiinstler." Loud indeed was Buonarroti's first reaction when he was told to his astonishment and irritation that the Pope wanted to put loincloths on the nudities of the Giudizio universale: "Dite al papa che questa e piccola faccenda, e che facilmente si puo acconciare; che acconci egli il mondo !"23 The thematic proposition that the poor and unclothed are the most virtuous people and the most beloved of God reminds one of a passage in Vasari. When Pope Julius found the Sistine ceiling "poor," Michelangelo retorted that primitive men and religious men could indeed appear plain and bare. "Padre Santo, in quel tempo gli uomini non portavano addosso oro, e quegli che son dipinti non furon mai troppo ricchi, ma santi uomini, perche gli sprezzarono le ricchezze."24 The slim little tale draws quickly to a close. The schoolmaster, to whom it is being narrated, fails to understand this enlightened approach to Biblical materials and objects: "Zunachst finde ich es unrecht, re- ligi6se, besonders biblische Stoffe frei und eigenmachtig zu gebrau- chen." This is the very complaint which Giulio da Fabriano, one of the loudest mouthpieces of the Counter-Reformation, lodged against Mi- chelangelo's paintings, and which was to have its echoes, incidentally, in the charges against Paolo Veronese before the Holy Tribunal. It is a counterpart of the feeling of Rilke's monk, in an unpublished passage of the Stundenbuch, that Michelangelo and his fellows were blasphe- mous in their endeavor to represent God.25 The titular hero of the eighth tale, "Von einem, der die Steine be- lauscht," is Michelangelo. This tripartite story is composed of three episodes in the life of the artist, two adapted from Vasari and all three growing out of an intimate understanding of Michelangelo's personal 22 Milanesi, Lettere, p. 488. 23 Vasari, Le Vite, VII, 240. 24 Ibid., VII, 178. 25 See Ruth M6vius, Rainer Maria Rilkes Stundenbuch (Leipzig, 1937), pp. 209-215. 223</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE aesthetics, based on the concetto as a predetermined, living, and grow- ing art form. At the outset the narrator returns to the theme of anthropocentrism introduced in the first tale. God is much less interested in external nature than in man. "Der Friihling, den Gott bemerken soll, darf nicht in Baumen und auf Wiesen bleiben, er muBI irgendwie in den Menschen machtig werden."26 We have already observed that this attitude of the master sculptor was that of Buonarroti, who advised Vasari to use nude figures rather than fogliami as decorative motifs.27 Michelangelo's pref- erence for nude figures in a "terra inanis et vacua" leads him to censure the Flemings for painting "patches, masonries, plants in the fields, shadows of trees, rivers, and bridges, all of which they call land- scapes."28 Like the Aristotelian theorists of his time, Michelangelo saw "man in action" as the only valid subject of painting and sculpture, as well as of tragedy and epic. In a baroque setting God and the angels hover over Renaissance Italy and watch the restless hands of Michelangelo, at first seeming folded as if in prayer ("aber das Gebet, welches ihnen entquoll, drangte sie weit auseinander"), cast a shadow over the peninsula. God does not resent this shadow. Indeed, He disregards the prayers of others which rise up heavenward to Him, and views Michelangelo's creative power as an offering to Him. The real-life Michelangelo did indeed feel that his exercise of painting, sculpture, and architecture was a service dedi- cated to God.29 God then looks more closely over the shoulder of the craftsman. He observes that the hands seem to be listening to the stone they are working and gives a start. Do the stones themselves have souls ? Apparently hearing a faint voice'from the stone, the hands set again to fashioning it. A major premise of Michelangelo's Neoplatonism was that art forms co-exist in the world of soul and the world of matter. It fostered his be- lief that living figures were sealed within marbles ("gardiens du contour pur"), a belief expressed in several poems known to Rilke, as his Dich- tungen show: Si come per leuar, Donna, si pone In pietra alpestra e dura Una uiua figura, Che la piu crescie, u' piu la pietra scema.30 26 Geschichten, p. 101. 27 Vasari, Le Vite, VII, 226. 28 De Hollanda, Vier Gespriche, p. 29. 29 Thus, when Michelangelo became architect-in-chief of St. Peter's, he refused an extra emolument from Paul III, stating that he was agreeing to serve in this new role only for his love of God. 30 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 90. 224</page><page sequence="8">RILKE AND MICHELANGELO So wie, indem man abnimmt, langsam nur innen im harten Berggestein sich findet ein Niederschlag lebendiger Figur, der mehr erwachst, je mehr der Stein verschwindet.31 Once it is accepted that the living concetto in the stone has a soul, it is easy to attribute a voice to it. This element of Michelangelo's thinking was so apparent to Rilke that he translated all three poems which are allegedly spoken by the living marbles. These are the stanza spoken by the Notte of the Medici Chapel, the dialogue between the Giorno and the Notte, and the plaint of the headstones on the sepulcher of Cecchino de' Bracci: Caro m'e '1 sonno et piu l'esser di sasso32 Schlaf ist mir lieb, doch iiber alles preise33 El Di e la Nocte parlano e dichono34 Es sprechen der Tag und die Nacht und sagen35 Dagli alti monti e d'una gra' ruina36 Von Bergen, wo der Felsen im Verein37 God, still startled by the faint voice in the stone, cries out: "Michel- angelo, wer ist im Stein?" The answer comes up, "Du, mein Gott, wer denn sonst. Aber ich kann nicht zu dir." The idea of Michelangelo's trying to attain God can be read in many of the Rime which Rilke put into German. God's unattainability for Michelangelo had occupied Rilke a few weeks before, while writing Vom mlnchischen Leben: Nur Gott bleibt iber seinem Willen weit: da liebt er ihn mit seinem hohen Hasse fiur diese Unerreichbarkeit.38 After Michelangelo has answered that God Himself is in the stone, the Deity becomes conscious of this, in a passage which could have been written only by someone familiar with Michelangelo's concetto theory: Und da fiihlte Gott, dab er auch im Steine sei, und es wurde ihm angstlich und enge. Der ganze Himmel war nur ein Stein, und er war mitten drin eingeschlossen und hoffte auf die Hainde Michelangelos, die ihn befreien wiirden, und er h6rte sie kommen, aber noch weit.39 31 Rilke, Dichtungen, p. 7. 32 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 126. 33 Rilke, Dichtungen, p. 5. 34 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 14. 35 Rilke, Gesammelte Werke, VI, 225.

The narrator shifts to the viewpoint of the sculptor, whose attention is now riveted upon a marble block in which his inner vision discerns the three figures of the Deposizione in the Florentine Duomo. It is no accident that Rilke selects this particular work to lend unity to his tale. For it is the one work in which both God and Michelangelo are incarn- ated, in the figures of Christ and Nicodemus, respectively. It serves as a transitional element between the concepts of God as a marmoreal art form, just introduced, and of Michelangelo as a similar art form, which closes the tale. That Nicodemus was a self-portrait, by the way, was known as far back as Vasari, and any native of Florence will assure you of the fact today. Seeing the three figures in potenza within the stone, Rilke's Michelangelo self-consciously echoes the most famous quatrain of the Rime: "Er dachte bestandig: du bist nur ein kleiner Block, und ein anderer k6nnte in dir kaum einen Mensch finden..." Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto, Ch' un marmo solo in se non circonscriua Col suo souerchio, et solo a quello arriua La man, che ubbidisce all'intelletto.41 Then this recreated Michelangelo goes further than his archetype had ever gone, wondering why he may not lift an entire sleeping race out of a rock. In a sense, the painter of the Sistine frescoes, including the Giudizio, who applied this theory of the predetermined concetti to paint- ing,42 did bring an entire race out of the pigment which had enclosed them. In any case, Rilke's sculptor "sets free" the figures of the De- posizione with "broad strokes," the same broad strokes which im- pressed Cellini as the result of the "awesome furies which came over him as he worked."43 But the surfaces of the Deposizione are purposely kept indistinct: "er loste nicht ganz die steinernen Schleier von ihren Gesichtern, als fiirchtete er, ihre tiefe Traurigkeit k6nnte sich lahmend iiber seine Hande legen." This expedient of the stone veil to soften the outright depiction of pain is as old as the Greek artist who left a statue of Agamemnon unfinished, fearing his inability to translate the anguish of a father seeing his daughter sacrificed; in any case, Michelangelo's contemporaries Lomazzo and Dolce both mention his recourse to the "veil of art."44 40 Rilke, Gesammelte Werke, II, 191. 41 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 89. 42 Michelangelo even applied this theory to writing and poetry, finding style resident in the ink itself, in a sonnet ("Sicome nella penna e nell' inchiostro") translated by Rilke ("So wie drei Stile in der Feder sind"). 43 Cellini, Due trattati (Milan, 1811), p. 213. 44 Lomazzo, Trattato di pittura e scultura (Rome, 1844), I, 47; Dolce, Dia- logo della pittura (Florence, 1735), p. 242. 226</page><page sequence="10">RILKE AND MICHELANGELO Michelangelo thereupon turns to other stones, and does not complete the figures which he finds in them. They would be most likely the San Matteo, the Giorno, and the Prigioni, all of which Rilke had un- doubtedly seen in Florence. Rilke is now posing the problem of the non finiti, a problem which has troubled and attracted many art historians. Rilke offers his own explanation, advanced by no one else. Michelangelo does not finish a statue, "damit ihre Sch6nheit nicht ganz verraten sei." The narrator now turns his attention to a well-known occasion in 1505 when Michelangelo was overseeing the quarrying of marbles at Carrara, seeking suitable blocks for the ill-fated tomb of Julius II.45 He will cover the tomb with a "Geschlecht" of figures, obviously the many allegorical Victories, Captives, and so on. As Vasari and Condivi indi- cate, the master's eye fastens upon a high mountain peak within which his mind's eye seems to see a colossus taking form. As the image of the colossus grows, the initial impression of the mountain dies away: "Und Michelangelo fiihlte seine Gestalt wachsen unter dem EinfluB dieses Blickes." L'inmagin dentro crescie, e quella cede Quasi uilmente e senza alcuna stima.46 Soon the sculptor feels that he, too, is growing in stature, just as Buonarroti was pictured as waxing "gigantengroB" in the Stunden- buch.47 He looks down and sees the huts underfoot far below, like that giant described by Michelangelo: Vn gigante u'e ancor d'alteza tanta, Che da sua ochi noi qua giu non uede... Al sol aspira e l'alte torre pianta... 48 Ein Riese ist noch, iiber alles groB, uns unten hier sehn seine Augen nicht... Zur Sonne laB3t er seine Tiirme los ... 49 Then Rilke knowledgeably describes the furia of Michelangelo's figures in a few well-chosen words. Of the colossus Michelangelo perceives in the mountain peak, he writes: "Es hatte einen wartenden Ausdruck, reglos und doch am Rande der Bewegung."50 This is the renowned action-in-check of Buonarroti's statuary and painting, achieved through a carefully contrived exploitation of contrapposto and serpentine, on which he expressed himself to Marco da Siena.51 Gratified at the in- destructible unity promised by such a colossal statue, Michelangelo de- 45 See Vasari, Le Vite, VII, 163; and Condivi, Vita di Michelangiolo (Flor- ence, 1938), p. 61. 46 Frey, Dichtungen, p. 24. 47 Rilke, Gesammelte Werke, II, 193. 48Frey, Dichtungen, p. 58. 49 Rilke, Dichtungen, p. 66. 5O Geschichten, p. 105. 51 Lomazzo, Trattato, I, 34-35; II, 87. 227</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE cides to accept the challenge of executing it ("Dich will ich vollenden") and turns back toward Florence, which in this fairy tale lies just around the corner. But God does not will it, and we have been forewarned in the first tale that "ohne Gott gibt es keine Vollendung." That this memorable incident in Michelangelo's biography was ling- ering in Rilke's mind when he composed the first part of the Stunden- buch a few weeks before may be assumed from the poet's outcry to God therein: und hatt dich gebildet, wie ein Gigant dich bilden wiirde: als Berg... 52 As Buonarroti enters Florence, he sees a star over the tower of the Duomo, reminiscent of a legend of the Savonarolians to the effect that the sculptor saw a comet arched toward Florence.53 Then the eighth tale races to a highly imaginative conclusion, for which we were subtly prepared by the introduction of Nicodemus above. Michelangelo sud- denly begins to feel the soverchio (superfluous surrounding matter) of the city of Florence starting to encase him as he reaches the Porta Ro- mana. The city blocks, his own house, his narrow room, and then his walls close in on him: "und es war, als kampften sie mit seinen Uber- maBen und zwangten ihn zuriick in die alte, enge Gestalt. Und er dul- dete es. Er driickte sich in die Kniee und lieB sich formen von ihnen." At this point God cries out to him, "Michelangelo, wer ist in dir?" And the artist, now reduced to one of his own concetti, like Nicodemus, answers, "Du, mein Gott, wer denn sonst." So God indeed must be the life force in artists who are at one with their creations and has been in them since He wished to have fashioned the arca foederis, the Ark of the Covenant.54 For the final Magnificat Rilke's gaze returns to the upper plane of the baroque stage setting where the limelights had originally been di- rected: God in triumph, the saints in their mitres and mantles, the choir of angels and cherubim, "wie mit Kriigen voll glanzenden Quells unter den diirstenden Sternen umher, und es war der Himmel kein Ende."55 The application of the concept of the sealed-in art form as a living thing, enlarged to the point of considering God and Michelangelo as both artists and art forms themselves, makes a fanciful if complex theme for a short story. In the Rime Rilke found Michelangelo identifying various individuals as actual or potential art forms, concetti: Vittoria Colonna, Tommaso Cavalieri, himself. Since Michelangelo had taken a bolder stand than most Church painters on iconolatry and anthropo- 52 Rilke, Gesammelte Werke, II, 188. 53 "Una visione del Buonarroti," II Buonarroti, IV (Apr. 1866), 103. 54 De Hollanda, Vier Gesprdche, p. 110. 55 Geschichten, p. 106. 228</page><page sequence="12">RILKE AND MICHELANGELO morphism, he did obviously view God as an art form. But the God-in- stone was the final and logical projection of the concetto theory whose "Unerreichbarkeit" held him, but not Rilke, back. In turning out thirteen tales in the short span of seven nights, could Rilke fail to sense Michelangelo's presence throughout? That presence is not noticeable in the stories of direct Russian inspiration, "Wie der Verrat nach RuIBland kam," "Wie der alte Timofei singend starb," "Das Lied von der Gerechtigkeit," and "Der fremde Mann," which were to demonstrate the new religious accents gained from the first trip to Russia. Neither Italy nor Russia figures in "Wie der Fingerhut dazu kam, der liebe Gott zu sein" or "Ein Marchen vom Tod." Appropriately enough, "Eine Szene aus dem Ghetto von Venedig" evokes Giorgione, Titian, and Tiepolo; there is no evocation of Michelangelo to remind us that it was in this ghetto that the Florentine stayed, to the consterna- tion of the proper Venetians, when he first visited Venice. Yet in that week of creation in November 1899 momentary snatches of his reading in Michelangelo returned. So, in "Der Bettler und das stolze Fraulein," the Florentine setting leads Rilke to a condemnation of crowded composition, which he sees as a corollary of the Renaissance desire to crowd as much as possible into one's lifetime. His ironic con- demnation of this dense composition recalls to us that Michelangelo deplored this tendency: " ... so fehlt daran in Wahrheit doch die rechte Kunst, das rechte MaI3, und das rechte Verhaltnis, sowie Auswahl und klare Verteilung im Raume und schliel3lich selbst Nerv und Sub- stanz."56 In this tale there is a direct reference to Michelangelo; the heroine is described as being "stolz wie ein Stein in den Handen Michel- angelos,"57 a factitious conceit not particularly Buonarrotian. In "Ein Verein aus einem dringenden Bediirfnis heraus" the theme is the foun- dation of an artist's colony, which has prompted Rilke scholars to a gratuitous and unlikely comparison with Worpswede. Three touches of Michelangelo's aesthetics reappear, more or less identifiable as such. The artist's known disinclination to talk about art, attested by De Hol- landa, Giannotti, and others, is reflected in "Die drei Maler sprachen natiirlich nicht von Kunst."58 Michelangelo's belief in an artistic elect endowed at birth with an intelletto ("Nel parto mi fu data la bel- lezza")59 seems implicit in the characterization: "es wirkliche Kiunstler waren, gewissermaB3en von der Natur beabsichtigte...

Rodin's marble Main de Dieut dates from 1902, two years after the publication of the Geschichten. None of Rilke's letters or journals-nor the monograph on Rodin-would indicate an influence by Rodin as early as 1899, any more than do the Geschichten themselves, even though Rilke had been introduced to the work of Rodin through Lepsius in 1897. In 1899, Michelangelo, as thinker and poet much more than practitioner, exercised an ascendancy over Rainer Rilke and the intellectually alert of his generation. The poetic and philosophic side of the Florentine master was newly revealed in those documentary sources to which we have been referring the reader throughout this article.66 Our inquiry would indicate that even at this moment Rilke had started to familiarize himself with and form preferences among those sonnets, madrigals, and canzoni on which he worked most in- tensely after 1914. If he failed to publish, for one reason or another, 61 See R. J. Clements, "Mind, Eye, and Hand in Michelangelo's Poetry," PMLA, LXIX (1954), 324-336. 62 Vasari, Le Vite, VII, 270. 63 Geschichten, p. 140. 64 Ibid., p. 172. 65 E. M. Butler, Rainer Maria Rilke (Cambridge, 1941), p. 101. This work, however, briefly supposes a strong and increasing Buonarrotian influence on Rilke, and suggests that this influence incited the heaven-storming page in his 1898 diary. 66 Further evidence that Rilke was using these primary sources rather than Grimm's popular biography of Michelangelo, which reproduces fragments of the letters and the Rime, is supplied by a recently published letter of Rilke to Graf Mensdorff under date of Jan. 1, 1917: "... . das sch6nste grundlegende Buch, das sein Leben erzahlt, ist sicher das von Hermann Grimm, das Ihnen dringend em- pfohlen sei, das ich aber selbst leider nie gelesen habe. Die groBe italianische Ausgabe der Gedichte, nach der ich iibersetze, enthalt einen ziemlich grol3en Apparat von Anmerkungen, mit dem ich mir helfe..." This could be only the edition of Frey. The letter quoted is reproduced in Mesa, IV (Spring 1952), 25-26, and was brought to my attention by my friend Professor Philip Shelley. 230</page><page sequence="14">RILKE AND MICHELANGELO poems commonly used since his time to explain Michelangelo's aes- thetics ("Per fido esemplo alla mia uocazione" and "Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto"), his absorption with the ethos and psyche of that artist made him translate Michelangelo's most intimate mystical revelations ("Giunta gia e '1 corso della uita mia," "Per qual mordace lima," "Non fur men lieti che turbati e tristi," etc.). One cannot draw facile conclusions, however, from the absence of certain poems from his translations, since Rilke abandoned various pieces because of their difficulty or obscurity (he apparently did not utilize the Guasti edition with its paraphrases in a simpler Italian). To an extent, then, the Geschichten afford more direct perceptions of Rilke's interest in Michelangelo than do the Dichtungen. Rilke's translations from the Rime are so faithful ("genaue und reine," in his words) that there is no room for himself in them. (They are, inci- dentally, better and more literal than the English equivalents of Sym- onds, done two decades earlier, although both unfortunately attempted to retain rhyme.) Rilke admitted this to Ellen Delp. "Nein, natiirlich spreche ich nicht Meiniges in ihnen aus, wenn ich sie meiner Sprache zu fassen gebe ... nicht von meinen Verhangnissen handeln sie."67 But Rilke the storyteller interwove elements from the Rime, the Lettere, and the biographies reflecting not only Michelangelo's aesthetic An- schauung, but also those moments when the Florentine was "in tanta passione." Rilke, as he wrote more than once, was shortly thereafter to find strength and joy and purpose in Rodin, who faced his personal and professional problems with stoicism and resignation. Yet his discovery of Michelangelo, who like himself poured all his Seelenangst into his letters and poems and who faced as a young and dedicated artist some of the same problems which were already beginning to torment Rilke as the century closed, could not fail to afford the comfort and encourage- ment of sympatheia. It has been supposed that Rilke's association with Rodin, who had written that the Florentine had "held out his powerful hand to me" and saved him from the academism of Ingres,68 heightened Rilke's interest in Michelangelo. It has also been supposed that the admitted influence of Rodin in making Rilke view art as an artist rather than as a littera- teur gave the younger man a new approach to Michelangelo. The Geschichten vom lieben Gott of 1899 disprove the first supposition and the Dichtungen des Michelangelo of 1914-23 invalidate the second.
