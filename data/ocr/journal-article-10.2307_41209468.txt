<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letter from England, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ANTHONY BURGESS JVIy final activity of 1966 was to appear on a very brief British Independent Televi- sion program along with a man of title (a baronet or something) who is president of the British Duodecimal Society. It is always heartening to discover, in a Britain increasingly conformist and genuflectory to the ruling oligarchy, small eccentric pockets of resistance. The British Duo- decimal Society wants to abolish 10 (I refer to the number and not the symbol) as the head of the numerical hierarchy and to substitute One Dozen. One Dozen is to be represented as 10, and our existing di- graphs for 10 and 11 are to become, respec- tively, the figures 2 and 3 turned upside down. This means that 3 X 10 will equal three dozen (30), and the useful Arabic zero will be in the service of a more reason- able kind of arithmetic than that tradi- tionally imposed on us by the tyranny of ten (or 2 upside down). I think I was persuaded to appear on this program because I have been one of the few loud voices raised in opposition to the proposed changeover of our decimal- duodecimal-octal British currency to a purely decimal one. In 1971, we are told, there will be no more pounds, shillings, pence, halfpence, florins, half-crowns, three- penny bits and guineas. There will be a heavy dollar, probably called a New Pound, and cents (or New Pennies) each of a value of 24 of our present penny. IVe pro- tested against this not because of arterio- sclerotic obscurantist xenophobic Little- O ANTHONY BURGESS begins with this column a series of reports for the Scholar on the contemporary British scene. England conservatism, but because our British system - first learned from Char- lemagne but justified pragmatically over many centuries of use - is the most con- venient and comprehensive in the world. A decimal coinage can admit of division only by 2, 4, 5, 10, 25 and 50, but our pounds, shillings and pence will yield also to 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and many other useful divisors. A British pound, true, is not divisible by either 7 or 9, but add one shilling to your pound and you get twenty- one shillings or one guinea, and both 7 and 9 slice into that beautifully. It is proposed that we give all this up and submit to a system that was only adopted (on both sides of the Atlantic) in a revolu- tionary fit of pseudo-rationalism. What is the point of enthroning 5 as your chief divisor? We are surely past counting on our toes and fingers. Computers, like nat- ural cells, reject 5; their arithmetic is binary. Decimalization is not only mad; it is out of date. One thing that horrifies me about the dollar is that attempted division by 3 (and surely a dollar has to be split three ways occasionally) produces a recurring decimal, an abstraction. But aren't cents - in any multiple other than the nickel, dime, quarter or fifty-cent piece - themselves ab- stractions? When a Third Avenue bar- tender tots up a heavy round of drinks he always seems to have to do it on paper. This, surely, is because he can't visualize, say, 85^ as real money; iťs an element in a calculation, part of an abstract process. No British barmaid or barman ever has to use a pencil and a pad. Five gins at 2s 6d each? Easy. You conceive an image of five 261</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR half-crowns (or two-and-sixpenny pieces) - very solid, very tangible. Long experience has taught you that four of those (which the common man calls half-dollars or tosheroons) make ten shillings. Add another one and you have twelve-and-six (12s 6d). Nothing to it. The British Duodecimal Society, which fights in vain for the enthronement of One Dozen (spelled 10), is naturally ap- palled at the impending disappearance of the shilling (a duodecimal coin: twelve pence in it, or four threepenny pieces). I have not yet heard complaints from the British Octal Society (if there is one) about the coming liquidation of the half-crown. A crown used to exist as a coin in its own right. Now it's a mere memory, although the term itself is never used whole. Five shillings (which was the value of the crown) is often called a dollar - or, in rhyming slang, an Oxford (Oxford scholar) - and half-a-dollar is, naturally, a synonym for a half-crown. The beauty of this coin lies in the fact that there are exactly eight of them in a pound, and this octal divi- sion seems to satisfy a deeply rooted in- stinct in man. Even Americans call a quarter "two bits," which means there must be eight bits to an American dollar. In Malaya, where they have Straits dollars (nine to the British guinea, so that $1 = 2S 4d), some of the natives insist on divid- ing the ringgit (satu ringgit is $1) into eight kupangs, and a kupang is a coin that doesn't officially exist. Nevertheless, it's more real to many than a ten-cent piece. Wasn't the dollar originally a "piece of eight," and doesn't the dollar sign itself stand for the fracturing of that number? I'm aware that these very insular and somewhat antiquated worries about the death of British money as Chaucer and Shakespeare and Dickens knew it will con- jure no pangs in American souls. Ameri- cans, like continental Europeans, have (I am thinking of the fox in ^Esop) lost their tails and must be happy to see England too decaudated. But cannot America, which is as devoted to the historic past as only a progressive nation can be, come to see that in a combined decimal, octal and duodecimal money system the common- sensical past and the rational future dance perfectly together, and determine on a reform of the United States coinage that will be, in effect, a forgiving return to the old way of the mother country? Computers, which follow natural cells in their devo- tion to the binary system, bank their data in eights. There are still sixty minutes in an hour and twice twelve hours in a day. Forget about those mad Frenchmen and come home. And let Britain (perhaps fol- lowing America's example) also come home. 1 he latter part of the old year was a bad time for the threatening of British institu- tions. The British Broadcasting Corpora- tion announced in very good time that it was presenting over Christmas a daringly new dramatic interpretation of Alice in Wonderland. This, it warned, would not be suitable for children. At once, before anybody had seen a synopsis, let alone a preview, the B.B.C. came under attack for tampering with tradition, vandalizing great art, even (somewhat obscurely) cor- rupting the young. There were even ques- tions asked in Parliament. The coinage could be interfered with, but not Alice. The public disquiet and anger represented a topping-up on the shocked reaction to previous, but well-remembered, B.B.C. enormities - a documentary play, for in- stance, called Up the Junction, which dealt frankly with fornication and abor- tion in London's Dickensian East End. And it happened that, at the time of the announcement about the new Alice, a young television playwright had written a horrifying version of Cinderella, with Prince Charming strangling poor Cinders: this, although commissioned by the B.B.C, was rejected summarily on submission of the script, but it was vaguely considered to be a straw in the wind of B.B.C. policy. This advance publicity for Alice ensured huge watching figures and even front-page coverage of the private preview as well as the public transmission. When - appropri- ately, on the feast of the Slaughter of the Innocents - Alice in Wonderland was 262</page><page sequence="3">LETTER FROM ENGLAND screened, everybody felt very let down. The only shock was in the discovery that so lively, humorous and amiable a book could be given so glum a dramatic render- ing. The adapter and producer was Jona- than Miller, a doctor of medicine who has gained a reputation on both sides of the Atlantic as a witty stage satirist, but is now apparently reaching a phase when he isn't quite sure what he wants to be - anthropologist, sociologist, τν man, Vic- torian specialist, literary critic or (that most deadly of contemporary phenomena) "controversial personality." His thesis in the new Alice was that the true fabric of the dream was best presented by de- animalizing and decartomorphizing its characters, so that Wonderland was peopled by recognizable Victorian "types" - smok- ing-capped dons and bombazined ladies. There cannot be any doubt that Lewis Carroll's beasts and playing-card anima- tions were meant to point, in good-na- tured satire, the eccentricities of grown- ups as a child might see them, especially in the ambience of a Victorian Oxford college. To strip off these thin disguises is - brashly and naively - to proclaim the obvious and destroy art. Miller assembled a formidable professional cast, including Sir John Gielgud, Sir Michael Redgrave and Peter Sellers, but they had nothing to do except caricature Victorian senility and feeble-mindedness. Had they been allowed to retain their animal superstructures (or, in the case of Peter Sellers, the pasteboard carapace of King of Hearts), that element of caricature would already have been taken care of; they would then have had an opportunity to individualize. Morever, there is something absurd about two old men on the beach reminiscing about being taught by an old tortoise, and the irrele- vance of the jokes about reeling, writhing and fainting, in coils becomes embarrassing. And if, at the Mad Hatter's tea party, the Hatter himself is viable in human form, the Dormouse and the March Hare cannot also claim naked anthropomorphism: that way the exquisiteness of the joke is lost. For his Alice, Miller chose a haughty young girl with a spotty complexion and a voice of inept flatness. The flatness, Miller claimed, was appropriate to a dream. Well, an assumed hypnotic monotone might come off, but that is a different thing from innate vocal dullness. And, anyway, the implied speech-tones of Alice's lines in the book itself suggest liveliness, sharp- ness of mind, bubbling bewilderment, humor, the delectable bossiness of a young and charming girl. The Millerian Alice had nothing to do with Carroll, nor, for that matter, did a lot of the dialogue, which Miller evidently wrote himself. A whole stanza of "You Are Old, Father William" was (I think inadvertently) left out, but the total indifference to Carroll's verses was symptomatic. The remarkable climax of the trial scene, where Alice cries "You're nothing but a pack of cards" and finds all the personages swooping about her in sudden flat pasteboard, was changed to a dissolution brought about by the Queen's shouting "Off with her head," which she had shouted often enough be- fore with no very terrible result. I will say no more about this admittedly clever but wholly misguided perversion of a profound and funny book, except to express regret that the simple-mindedness of today's British young should be exalted into a hitherto unknown clear-headedness. Why, they are all bold enough and clever enough to show the reality underlying complex works of art. Let us now take Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat and weed all the laughs out of it. It is not seemly to laugh, except very bitterly, in the age of Vietnam and universal famine. Besides, that Victorian age was the night- mare workshop of all our present horrors, and it is unfair that the dwellers in it, who found it a kind of paradise, should be allowed to rest in peace. Drag up Alice and make her, with the aid of techniques learned from the films of Cocteau and Robbe-Grillet, learn what a cauchemar her summer's day dream really was. Take J., George and Harris and make them see what their trip down the Thames really is - an attempted escape into history which rises from its tombs and documents and bites them with bubonic plague. Three 263</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR men alone together? They must be homo- sexual. They enjoy their food? Let the cameras range creepily over heaps of beef and veal-and-ham pie and apple turnovers and then zoom on to the writhing mag- gots. Let their dog Montmorency be messily run over by a hansom cab. Hold that shot of the mangled limbs, let the dying screams serve for postludial music, then roll your credits. These Victorian writers, however frothy and escapist the books they produced, knew at least as much about their own age as we do. Similarly, Shakespeare could contrive the highly wrought filigree of Utopian pastoralism while the bears Harry Hunks and Sackerson tore dogs apart alive in Paris Garden, and men and women died of plague, and traitors were shown their smoking entrails in extremis at Tyburn. There is a new puritanism about in Brit- ain which is highly suspicious of simple gaiety. The stage must proclaim the The- ater of Fact, and fact must be shameful and devastating - limbless children in Viet- nam, dogs lapping watery excrement among Calcutta's starving. Well, one might go some way toward denouncing a frivolous dismissal of today's ghastliness in the art of today, but to mangle the art of the past in petulant vindictiveness is quite another matter. For the true motive behind Jona- than Miller's interpretation of Alice was to deprive a child of her dream, to show her Victorian life as the twentieth century sees it. This goes further, perhaps, than mere slaughter of the innocents. For Alice was dragged from the grave as a zombie (she sounded like one) and made to par- ticipate in a sophisticated feast that gave off cachou-whiffs of corruption. 1 mentioned a new puritanism in Britain. This may seem to accord ill with mini- skirts and swinging London, wherever that is. But - despite the dope-jags and the free- for-all sex - the puritanism is undoubtedly there; indeed, it is probably nastier than the old Massachusetts Brownism or Crom- wellian theocracy, since it frequently mas- querades as permissiveness. A middle-aged man has just been sent to trial for indecent assault because, when a couple of mini- skirted teenagers visited his home, he put his hands on their knees. His gesture seems to me a reasonable one: if you see something you like the look of, your in- stinct is to touch it. But the girls cried aloud their puritanical horror, and now this man is up on a major charge. Some- times, when I travel on the London Under- ground, I am faced on the seats opposite by a phalanx of silk thighs that cannot be accorded the static tribute of pure aesthetic appreciation. I am moved, I am excited, yet I must keep my face stony. An involuntary leer of admiration would bring all the well-oiled apparatus of the law into action, or at least a bloody nose from a boy-friend. The seventeenth-cen- tury Brownists and Cromwellians led no- body into temptation, but nowadays, in lubricious London, a delectable ice-topping covers a sad cake of dead-sea fruit and purgative bran. The young seem to have all the sex they need, but sleeping together has an aura of duty about it (stern daughter of the voice of God): little joy and, I should imagine, little skill. In any television play the first kiss has to be followed at once by the first postcoital languor. It is a terrible thing to be square and chaste and thus fall into the hands of the living God. If there were more passion I should not be so (and this sounds, I know, puritanical enough) cen- sorious, but there is too much of the ful- filling of cold rituals, the practice of a religion without love in it. Even the ges- tures of protest, which admit a ghost of passion, are generated collectively: it was once the Bomb, now it is the Vietnam war. There is little evidence of the thrust of the individual will; there is a terrible fear of nonconformism. It is appropriate that the stink of puri- tanism should cling to everything; after all, we have a government that is closer to stern Oliver than to the dissolute Stuarts. Freedom of conscience is frowned on; let every human act find appropriate legislation. If we smoke cigarettes we will 204</page><page sequence="5">LETTER FROM ENGLAND kill ourselves; therefore increase the num- ber of no-smoking railway carriages, ban television cigarette commercials, consider a total prohibition of smoking in public places. It is bad that British citizens should seek the sun in foreign parts, therefore re- duce their hard-currency allowance. Make the price of whisky exorbitant. Let us brace ourselves for the economic struggle and let us hope - since the British spirit thrives on stringencies - that this struggle will last a long time. Then further wholesome curbs on free will may be introduced. It will be in the interests then of the puritan economy that miniskirts should be shorter still, sav- ing material. And if we are intolerably tempted, there is always the cold water of the law to be poured on our rising passions. England swings. Indeed, and on a British- made gallows.</page></plain_text>
