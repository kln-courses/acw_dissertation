<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS Dictionary of the History of Ideas. Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas. Edited by Philip P. Wiener.* New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973. Four volumes, Pp. xxxi+677; 696; 677; 537. It is not often that the term "monumental" can be applied to a work of international scholarship without hyperbole and with literal accuracy; the Dic- tionary of the History of Ideas surely provides one of those rare occasions. Ap- pearing as it does in the year marking the centenary of A.O. Lovejoy's birth, planned and brought to a triumphant completion by his associates and colleagues, handsomely designed and produced, it is in a very direct sense a monument to Lovejoy. It constitutes a survey of the present state of the discipline which he and his colleagues and students so largely helped to bring to maturity. The methods and range of the contributors, of course, go beyond Lovejoy's, as the preface indicates. It is also monumental in the sense that it establishes, as a surveyor's monu- ments do, the boundaries and the main points of reference in a large map of an in- tellectual territory, marking the areas explored and surveyed, and by implication denoting terra incognita for the future explorer. In the words of its subtitle, it presents studies of "selected pivotal ideas." As the admirable brief preface by the editor-in-chief, Philip P. Wiener, points out, the complete history of ideas is the complete history of the human mind; what these studies of selected topics have as their dominant purpose is "to help establish some sense of the unity of human thought and its cultural manifestations in a world of ever-increasing specializa- tion and alienation." In pursuit of this aim, although the basic planning of the work involved beginning with the analysis of ideas into categories, the overlap- ping of these categories is as important as the categories themselves. This is indi- cated not only by the preface, but by the cross-references at the end of each article, which customarily go far beyond the obvious links. The categories themselves are indeed very broad: the articles in each of the seven categories are listed alphabetically in the first table of contents. There is, as the preface also notes, an element of the arbitrary in this categorization: "few of the pivotal ideas presented fall squarely and only within any one group." If the reader does not understand this before he starts, he soon learns it, and rapidly finds the profitable use of both the analytical table and the cross-references. The index volume, when it appears in 1974, will nevertheless be a further very useful tool. The analysis and assembly of ideas in categories was obviously assisted and supplemented by a wide knowledge of published work in the history of ideas; the impressive list of 254 contributors, drawn from a world-wide range of institu- tions, offers a comprehensive author catalogue for a bibliography of history of ideas, supplemented by the bibliographies attached to each article. The pattern of *Associate Editors: Isaiah Berlin, George Boas, Salomon Bochner, Felix Gilbert, Frank E. Manuel, Ernest Nagel, Ren6 Wellek; Consulting Editors: Harold Cherniss, Wallace K. Ferguson, E.

PRIESTLEY the whole complex of over three hundred articles is, then, a result partly of the ideal scheme arrived at by the analysis made by the editors, and partly of the practical consideration that for every article to be included, someone must be found who has made a study of the particular aspect of the history of ideas it is to deal with. Where there seem to be gaps in the coverage, it is usually an indication that scholars have so far not turned their full attention to those areas, or perhaps occasionally that scholars working in the areas were not ready to present their conclusions in the form of articles. Inspection of the tables of contents does not, to be sure, make gaps leap to the eye. In close to 2600 double-columned pages, estimated by a fellow-reviewer at nearly three million words, there is clearly God's plenty, and the reader is much more likely to be pleasantly surprised by finding things he did not expect than disappointed by not finding something he anticipated. Few could have expected the delightful and interesting illustrated article on Chance Images, or that on Theriophily, or that on Game Theory, nor would many look for such modish topics as Conservation of Natural Resources, Imprinting and Learning Early in Life, Civil Disobedience, Due Process in Law, and Existentialism. A close consideration of the contents will however suggest that some areas, as one might expect, are more fully dealt with than others. In the first category, for instance, dealing with ideas about the external order of nature, there are excellent articles covering many of the themes in physical science. A general and comprehensive article on the concept of Nature makes a useful introduction. Cosmology from antiquity to modern times is dealt with in two articles, and two more articles treat the history of Atomism from antiquity to the seventeenth century. The subsequent history of atomism at least to the end of the nineteenth century would have been a welcome addition. Experimental Science and Mechanics in the Middle Ages gives a good summary of develop- ments in the four centuries before the emergence of the new science, and Changing Concepts of Matter from Antiquity to Newton again traces a theme from primitive ideas up to the early eighteenth century, with rather more em- phasis on the philosophical than the scientific. Optics and Vision provides a brief and rapid, but very useful, survey of this branch of science from earliest to modern times. The essays on Space, on Time, and on Time and Measurement also treat the full history of these important topics. Modern developments are dealt with in essays on Entropy, on Relativity, and on Indeterminacy in Physics. Several topics of importance, particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, might have warranted further articles: concepts of aether, theories of magnetism and electricity, and the various theories of gravitation seem suitable candidates. Since these have all attracted the attention of historians of ideas, it is probably right to assume that the editors were unable to enlist volunteers for these articles. Earth science is given only one article, Uniformitarianism and Catastro- phism, and this limits its historical treatment to a relatively short period. There seems to be no article on early conceptions of our earth's structure, and no dis- cussion of, say, the entertaining and ingenious theories of Burnet's Sacred Theory and the works of Woodward, Whiston, and Keill which followed. The treatment of ideas of evolution is also limited and insufficiently historical. The short article on Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics devotes half of its five pages to a</page><page sequence="3">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS 529 refutation of Lysenko, leaving little room for an adequate account of Lamarck or any other predecessors. Inheritance through Pangenesis covers some of the same ground, and is better balanced. In the main article, Evolutionism, the author's en- thusiasm for Darwin leads to some historical distortion. He remarks that after Darwin "biologists no longer concerned themselves with the biblical story of the creation of species, or geologists with the story of the Flood," and that Darwinism's opponents were "mainly members of the privileged upper classes who regarded the theory as a threat to the Establishment." The implication is that there was no respectable scientific opposition to Darwin, which is far from the truth. Darwin's extensive revisions of the Origins were not in response to pressure from the Establishment, nor from "quasi-theological" writers. Nor was Ussher's chronology of creation in 4004 B.C. widely accepted in 1859, as the author implies. Indeed he himself notes elsewhere, in referring to the "new cos- mogony" and to Buffon's geology, that "by the beginning of the nineteenth century, the age of the earth was estimated in millions rather than thousands of years." The central questions that occupied the nineteenth-century biologists, whether order implies teleology, whether species are real entities or convenient taxonomical abstractions (which the author refers to but does not discuss in relation to Lamarck), and whether the evidence marshalled by Darwin is plau- sible, persuasive, or convincing-these, rather than a simple confrontation of hero and Establishment, are the stuff of nineteenth-century history. The upsurge of neo-vitalism represented by Driesch, McBride, and others is also surely of some historical significance, judging by the extent of the controversy it aroused and the eminence of many of the participants. The other articles on biology, Biological Conceptions in Antiquity, Biological Homologies and Analogies, Biological Models, Recapitulation, and Spon- taneous Generation, cover a good deal of ground ably, the one on models being particularly suggestive in its explanation of the limits to the applicability of models, with an implied criticism of much popular thought, and in its neat dis- tinction between models of and modelsfor. The second category, of ideas about human nature, is, rather to one's sur- prise, the smallest, having only twenty topics, suggesting at first glance that Pope's injunction, "the proper study of mankind is man," has had little effect over the last two centuries. But it takes only a brief inspection of this and later categories to recognize that ideas about human nature are more or less involved in a vast spectrum of topics, and to recall that Pope's own Essay on Man is or- ganized into categories parallel to those here. The element of necessary arbi- trariness in allocation is probably more noticeable here than in any other of the groupings, but really no more important. The only effect is to make the cross- references, and the index, when it is available, probably more useful here than elsewhere, since some of the topics a reader might expect to find in this category will be in other ones. Having found eighteenth-century primitivism here, for example, he might expect ideas of progress, which he will find in category four, under ideas of history. Both involve theories of human nature and also theories of history and of culture. In category three, on the arts, much of the theory of the human mind, ideas about reason, fancy, and the imagination, enters into the dis- cussions of Genius, Creativity in Art, Classicism, Music as a Divine Art, Romanticism, and so on. Other psychological theories appear in category six, re-</page><page sequence="4">530 F.E.L. PRIESTLEY ligious and philosophical ideas, where the important questions of free will, of happiness and pleasure, of irrationalism, of metaphysical imagination, of moral sense, of the perfectibility of man, of relativism in ethics, of right and good, will recall for the student of ideas most of the hot arguments about man, his nature, and his proper end, which enlivened several centuries of controversy. The editors have chosen to restrict category two in the main to the history of whole theories of psychology: the essays on the Virtuoso and on Witchcraft seem somewhat out- side of the pattern. One would, perhaps, have liked to see included specific arti- cles on the history of the concept of reason, of fancy, and of the imagination, or on theories of human motivation. The three articles on psychological theory leave far too many gaps. That on Psychological Schools in European Thought takes a very short view; there is in fact much more of an account of European, and particularly English thought, in the one on Psychological Theories in American Thought, which is excellent. But in none of the three will the student be able to find out what theories were held by various thinkers in medieval, Renaissance, seventeenth- or eighteenth-century times of how the human mind worked, how it perceived, what a sensorium was, what "sensible" and "intelligible" meant, what the conflict between Mandeville and Shaftesbury was about, what shifting meanings attached themselves to terms like idea, sensation, impression, reason, fancy, imagination, sense. There does seem to be here some territory, if not un- known, then unmapped or not fully charted. The third category, ideas in literature and the arts in aesthetic theory and literary criticism, is immensely rich. It contains more than sixty articles, a great many of which are very substantial treatments of large subjects. Their range is evident from their titles: Classification of the Arts, Theories of Beauty (two arti- cles), Art and Play, Form in the History of Aesthetics, Taste in the History of Aesthetics, Iconography, and six splendid articles on Myth, providing a comprehensive historical survey from antiquity to the present. Other topics such as Ambiguity as Aesthetic Principle, Concept of Gothic, Sublime in External Nature, Ut pictura poesis, Art for Art's Sake, Genius (two articles) and Creativity in Art, have general implications for more than one art, as do the arti- cles on music (except for Music and Science) and on the pictorial arts. Harmony or Rapture in Music has its relevance to literature, particularly in certain ele- ments of Romanticism, and theories of Musical Genius, of Music as a Demonic Art, of Music as a Divine Art, parallel developments in literary theory. So also movements like Impressionism in Art, Naturalism in Art, and Neo"Classicism in Art cast light on movements in literature and in music. It is only natural that the verbal art of literature should bring out the largest body of articulate ideas, and it is accordingly very well represented here. The whole set of articles would provide students with a very solid foundation in literary theory. Those who are accustomed to using words loosely will perhaps expect more than they get from Evolution of Literature. Instead of being a concise account of the "evolution" of the whole of literature, it is a rigorous and scholarly study of the application to the history of literature of the biological analogy implicit in the term "evolution," starting with Aristotle, who began it. It is by implication a rebuke to slovenly users of the term. A better starting-point for the general study of literature here is the same author's Literary Criticism, a massive and beautifully constructed historical essay. This can be supplemented</page><page sequence="5">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS 531 by the essays on Literature and its Cognates, Style in Literature, Expressionism in Literature, Symbol and Symbolism. Then main types of literature can be ap- proached through Rhetoric and Literary Theory in Platonism, Rhetoric after Plato, Poetry and Poetics from Antiquity to Mid-Eighteenth Century, followed by Sense of the Comic, Satire, Literary Paradox, Sense of the Tragic, Catharsis, Mimesis, Irony. Periodization in Literary History then prepares for articles dealing with particular periods: Classicism in Literature, Baroque in Literature, Ancients and Moderns, two articles on Romanticism, Realism in Literature, and Victorian Sensibility and Sentiment. As this ordering of articles into a suggested curriculum for students of literature makes clear, the coverage is admirably comprehensive. Even the arti- cles which may seem by their titles to have a slender connection with the arts, like those on Demonology and Millenarianism, turn out to be very valuable indeed to the student of seventeenth-century literature. The first, though brief, offers ex- cellent material from Rabbinical commentary and from Neo-Platonic and medieval sources highly useful to students of Milton. The second, equally com- pact and excellent, covers a wide range of reference, from Piers Plowman to Mary Baker Eddy and Marx, and corrects the current vulgar errors about the millennium. Amid all this wealth, omissions or desiderata are not obvious, but perhaps one could suggest that a separate general article on sentiment (including sensibility and sentimentality) might be useful, as would articles on burlesque and parody, or on decorum, and a history of the development of concepts of genre. The last would be a large undertaking in an area which has been relatively neglected. Category four, ideas about history, although including only twenty-three essays, seems to cover the ground rather thoroughly. The essay which may be taken as the general introduction is that on Historiography. This is an impressive piece of work, virtually a small book in itself, written with ease and clarity, moving through a vast range so adroitly that the reader is scarcely aware of the compression, which never becomes congestion. It offers a history of historical writing from the earliest times, including brief glances at Islamic and Chinese his- torians, with pithy descriptions of aims and techniques, patterns of historical thought, and the development of history as art and as science. It is supplemented by the essay, Influence of Political Ideas on Ancient Greek Historiography, which gives a more detailed study of its particular area, and by the short piece on Historicism, concerned with philosophy of history from Vico to the present, with a main focus on the "dilemma of historicism," the impulse towards relativism implicit in the historical approach. Main patterns underlying historical approaches are dealt with in Determin- ism in History, Cycles (which discusses various cyclic theories in cosmology as well as in history), Fortune, Fate, and Chance (a general treatment with implica- tions in history), Crisis in History, Progress (in two articles, and including some discussion of primitivism), Volksgeist, Zeitgeist, and Periodization in History. Several of these essays, particularly the last, take in a broad view, constituting a further general introduction. Cultural Development in Antiquity, and Culture and Civilization in Modern Times investigate briefly ideas about culture (including ideas of primitivism and of progress) in their respective periods. Pe- riodization itself gets illustrated and further analyzed in the Idea of Renaissance,</page><page sequence="6">532 F.E.L. PRIESTLEY Humanism in Italy, Renaissance Humanism, Renaissance Literature and His- toriography, Enlightenment, and the Counter-Enlightenment. Wider horizons are focussed on in two good essays on Oriental Ideas in American Thought, and China in Western Thought and Culture. The latter is a good example of history of ideas, since it concentrates on what Western minds took China to be like, marking through documentation shifting attitudes and interpretations. Since the author quotes Tennyson's (or rather his character's) "Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay," one wishes he had noticed the same poet's "The Ancient Sage." The problem of selecting topics for category five, the historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies, and move- ments, must have been particularly difficult from the mere overwhelming volume of subjects that present themselves. In general, the problem has been solved by keeping at a higher level of abstraction, and including fewer studies of particular aspects or of particular periods than in other categories. This is a very sensible so- lution. One result is that political ideas and institutions provide more than half of the fifty-nine titles, followed by legal ideas, while economic ideas are assigned a relatively small fraction. The choice seems to reflect the fact that apart from the rich border-land where political and economic ideas meet and mingle, purely eco- nomic ideas tend to be particular in concern, and often technical, without the broad overtones and interrelations so fascinating to the historian of ideas. There are a few economic ideas of historic importance the reader might have expected to find here, concepts like balance of trade, price, labor theory of value (or eco- nomic theories of value), mercantilism, industrialism (or the Industrial Revo- lution), or capitalism, with its fusion of the economic and political. But a number of these are of more importance in other areas of history than in history of ideas. Their absence is not serious. Legal ideas are very well represented and very well dealt with, starting with the Concept of Law and an article on Justice. The main historical developments in broad conceptions of law are presented in five essays: Natural Law and Natural Rights, Ancient Greek Ideas of Law, Ancient Roman Ideas of Law, Common Law, and Equity in Law and Ethics. More particular exposition is given in Causation in Law, Legal Precedent, Legal Responsibility, Equal Pro- tection in Law, Legal Concept of Freedom, and Due Process in Law. Taken together, these essays, which combine analysis with a great deal of excellent his- torical treatment, give a very full and clear account of the development of our main legal ideas. A few essays on very particular issues, like those on Academic Freedom, Civil Disobedience, and Protest Movements, serve well to illustrate ap- plication of the principles historically developed. The essays on legal ideas have their own special kind of tight consistency, as have legal ideas themselves. This doubtless is a result of the unique kind of continuity in the theory and practice of law, where even novelties appeal to precedent, and where modifications are felt at once to affect history. No such coherence is apparent in political ideas. We start at the most funda- mental, with the concept of Authority, and move from it to the concepts of the State and of Loyalty. We are then into the -isms. First the possible forms of government: Democracy, Despotism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Socialism from Antiquity to Marx, Marxism. Then we come to political attitudes: Conser-</page><page sequence="7">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS 533 vatism (which gets a rather unsympathetic treatment), Liberalism, Nationalism, Constitutionalism, Machiavellism. The Social Contract, the General Will, Vox Populi, Class, are given separate treatment as important historical ideas, as are Balance of Power, International Peace, War and Militarism, Property, and the Welfare State. Special topics of a more particular nature are relatively few: Medieval and Renaissance Ideas of Nation, Romanticism in Political Theory, Utopia, Historical and Dialectical Materialism, Marxist Revisionism from Bern- stein to Modern Times, Social Democracy in Germany and Revisionism, and Social and Historical Attitudes towards Women make up the rather miscella- neous group. There is apparently no account of the development of Constitu- tional Monarchy. Theories of representation are touched on, but not analyzed in detail nor followed in detail historically; the relation between the theory of virtual representation (as in James Mill's Essay on Government) and extension of the franchise is a topic worth exploring. One might perhaps have expected a history of the idea of the separation of powers; the balanced constitution is only briefly referred to. But once again, as always in this most generous collection, one must give thanks for what is there, for the quality of what is there. What there is in this category, as in others, is ample material for a liberal education. The largest of the categories, containing just over a quarter of all the topics, is the sixth, religious and philosophical ideas. Theology and philosophy are so closely related in so much of the history of Western thought that many of the essays deal with both, but a rough division indicates slightly under a half devoted to entirely or dominantly religious ideas. From the point of view of the historian, this provides a very welcome emphasis. During most of the centuries of the Chris- tian era, until at least well into the nineteenth, few aspects of thought or behavior were devoid of theological implications, and it became a persistent habit of mind to look for these implications everywhere. In our own day, in somewhat parallel fashion, virtually everything can be seen to have political implications, and it has come to seem natural to look for them. Theology having gone out of fashion, even with theologians, the world in which all thinking went on in a theological framework has become quite remote and strange, its whole focus unintelligible. The article on Deism in this very category illustrates the point. Within its limits it is excellent, but it interprets Deism almost entirely in terms of liberal freethinkers struggling against the Establishment: that is, in primarily modern political terms. There is, to be sure, a strong element of this motivation in what Mossner calls "destructive Deism," but this is by no means the sole motivation. The author of the article refers to Dryden's Religio Laici, but does not refer to the works Dryden is commenting on, Lord Herbert of Cherbury's De Veritate and De Reli- gione Gentilium. Nor does he note the nature of Dryden's arguments, and his ap- peal to St. Paul against Athanasius. Had he done so, he would have recognized that Deism has its rise in the question whether man can be saved by a knowledge of God arrived at by unaided reason, that is, by natural theology, or whether all who have not had access to Revelation must be damned. The question arose early in Christianity in relation to deserving pre-Christians of the Classical world, and, as Paul indicates, deserving Gentiles who had not heard the Christian word. It arose again acutely with the discovery of new worlds and new peoples. As Dryden makes clear, the crux of the question involves the nature and validity of natural theology, and of the powers of unaided human reason. It is thus a question with</page><page sequence="8">534 F.E.L. PRIESTLEY very wide theological ramifications. Herbert is what Mossner calls a "construc- tive Deist," not seeking to oppose natural to revealed theology; so, ostensibly at least, is Locke in The Reasonableness of Christianity. A proper historical treatment of Deism has to take account of the theological as well as the political issues. So does a proper historical account of most thought, including the philo- sophical, the scientific, and the social, throughout most of the Christian era. This involves some education in the history of theology and of religious ideas, a fact which gives importance to the essays in this category. They are admirable for their purpose. Preliminary essays on the Origins of Religion and on Ritual in Religion prepare for three superbly comprehensive introductory essays on the Idea of God: from Pre-history to the Middle Ages; from 1400-1800, and since 1800. Some of the main ideas general to religion expand and supplement the introduc- tion: the Holy (the Sacred), Creation in Religion, Death and Immortality, Sin and Salvation, Eschatology, Cosmic Fall, the Problem of Evil, Dualism in Philosophy and Religion, Theodicy, the Great Chain of Being, Prophecy in He- brew Scripture, Prophecy in the Middle Ages. The Church as an Institution briefly prepares for a large study of Christianity. The masterly essay on Christianity in History provides a solid historical back- ground for the other essays. It is a superb and graceful condensation of two thou- sand years of history into what is in effect a short book in itself. It is, however, concerned with the history of the growth and development of the Church, rather than with the ideas that animated and enlivened the growth. It gives very little space, for example, to the Scholastics, naming the topics they thought about, but not giving the nature of their ideas on these topics. It gives no real account of Ockham. Pelagianism is mentioned in connection with Luther, but with no mention of the doctrine of grace. We are told that Luther undermined the sacra- mental system of the Church, but not what the sacramental system was, nor of its place in Christian theology. We are given Luther's main theses without context or explanation of their relation to orthodox doctrine. Luther's doctrine of "justification by faith" is rather misleadingly presented without its usual "alone," and with no reference to the complex question of faith and works. Luther, we are told, "did not give the same authority to Old Testament law" as Karlstadt, but with no allusion to the question, familiar to readers of Milton's di- vorce pamphlets, of the status of Old Testament law in the Christian dis- pensation. The doctrine of "real presence" is named but not explained. Calvin's "sovereignty of God" is set over against Luther's "idea of Grace," but we are given no account of Voluntarist theology, or of the varied doctrines of the Fall that lead to varied concepts of the order of Nature and the order of Grace. These omissions of doctrinal exposition are undoubtedly deliberate. The purpose of the article is to provide a clear account of the development of the Church as an insti- tution, of its organization or discipline, recording but not explaining the main doctrinal struggles and the fissions that organization was subject to. This it does splendidly. The theological ideas then get looked after in a group of essays on a number of central themes, reinforced by two articles on Heresy in the Middle Ages and Heresy in the Renaissance and Later. An essay on heresy in the first thousand years of Christianity would have been a valuable complement to this excellent</page><page sequence="9">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS 535 pair. The heresy articles clarify many of the allusions in Christianity in History. The second, however, ignores the hot Deist-Trinitarian controversy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in its discussion of textual criticism makes no mention of Fr. Simon's early Critical History of the New Testament. A compact, clear, and thoughtful essay on Alienation in Christian Theology, one on Faith, Hope, and Charity, and a related pair on Determinism in Theology: Predestination, and Free Will in Theology, further expound and clarify theological positions, as do those on Pietism, on Gnosticism, and on Reformation. Two deal with special periods, Religion and Science in the Nineteenth Century, and Modernism in the Christian Church. Religions other than Christianity are dealt with to some extent in the three essays on the Idea of God, and briefly in some of the other general topics. Only one, Buddhism, gets an article to itself. One would have liked to see besides Prophecy in Hebrew Scripture and the Judaic idea of God an account of Judaism in History matching the clarity and comprehensiveness of the one on Chris- tianity, outlining the movements and controversies in theology and discipline within Judaism. The remaining essays deal with what might be called the negative: Ag- nosticism, Impiety in the Classical World, Skepticism in Antiquity, and Skepticism in Modern Thought-and with two highly interesting special topics, Analogy in Patristic and Medieval Thought, and Metaphor (which includes analogy) in Religious Discourse. When attention is turned to the philosophical ideas, the reader is likely to be strongly aware that since philosophy is entirely concerned with ideas its whole history is history of ideas. He will then survey the selection of topics with sym- pathy for the selectors. It may be a lucky accident of alphabetization, but the first essay of the Dictionary is on Abstraction in the Formation of Concepts, an ad- mirable introduction to the whole contents, and to the philosophical articles in particular. A thoughtful essay on Metaphor in Philosophy studies the rl6e of metaphor (as "root metaphor") in philosophical and scientific thinking. This is supplemented by a pair of historical essays on Analogy in Early Greek Thought, and Analogy in Patristic and Medieval Thought. The very interesting article on Metaphysical Imagination, a study of the history of the concept of imagination, and of imagination as cognitive, perhaps also belongs in this group, although it has strong claims to places in categories two and three. It would be important to any student of Romanticism. Fundamental problems are dealt with in such essays as Appearance and Reality, Ideas, Hierarchy and Order, Macrocosm and Microcosm, Dualism in Philosophy and Religion, Time, Right and Good, Double Truth, Moral Sense, Utilitarianism, Certainty (two essays), Causation (three essays), Free Will and Determinism, Necessity, Happiness and Pleasure, and Ethics of Peace. Historical treatment of particular philosophical systems starts with Pythagorean Doctrine to 300 B.C. and Pythagorean Harmony of the Universe. Platonism gets three essays, on Platonism in Philosophy and Poetry (a very rich subject), Platonism in the Renaissance, and Platonism since the Enlightenment. The last essay rather underestimates the continuity and influence of Cambridge Platonism in England throughout the eighteenth century into the nineteenth. Other Classical philosophy is discussed in Rationality among Greeks and</page><page sequence="10">536 F.E.L. PRIESTLEY Romans, Epicureanism and Free Will, Cynicism, Ethics of Stoicism, and Neo- Platonism. Medieval philosophy has articles on Hermeticism and on Ramism. In modern philosophy, special essays are devoted to Baconianism, the Ideal in Philosophy from the Renaissance to 1800, Antinomy of Pure Reason, Romanticism in Post-Kantian Philosophy, Hegelian Political and Religious Ideas, three historical treatments of Positivism (in Europe to 1900, in Latin America, and in the twentieth century), Existentialism, and Pragmatism. There are a few additional topics, Relativism in Ethics, the Perfectibility of Man, and Irrationalism in the History of Philosophy. Non-Western philosophy is represented by a single essay on the Islamic Conception of Intellectual Life; that on Causation in Islamic Thought, included in the next category, also relates aspects of Islamic religion and philosophy. An arrangement of the titles such as the foregoing, while it suggests in broad terms the extent of the coverage and the principles of selection, gives perhaps less real notion of the full scope of the articles than in any of the other categories. A good many of the essays on abstract subjects, like that on Idea, for example, dis- cuss topics involving a survey of a succession of philosophers and philosophies over a large historical span. Much more of the history of philosophy is con- sequently covered than might be suggested merely by the articles with specific his- torical titles. This is, within its necessary limits, an excellent category. The last category, formal mathematical, logical, linguistic, and methodo- logical ideas, although it contains only twenty-three articles, can properly be described as meaty, and for the lay reader some of the meat will call for careful chewing. The formal mathematical ideas are excellently introduced by the stimu- lating survey, Mathematics in Cultural History. Equally fine essays deal with Number and with Infinity. Three essays, on Chance, Game Theory, and Probability: Objective Theory, form a series of increasingly technical and so- phisticated treatments. An essay on the Relativity of Standards of Mathematical Rigor, a history of the search for total rigor in the pursuit of mathematical "truth," with successively changing concepts of rigor, contributes further to the general history of mathematics and its relations to science and to logic. Scientific ideas in this category are concerned with methodology and with basic patterns of scientific thought. The first is dealt with historically in two essays on Classification of the Sciences, a short but comprehensive survey including a rapid treatment of ancient Chinese and Indian systems, and on the Unity of Science from Plato to Kant, which traces historically what is essentially an attempt at a single definition for the whole of science, defining in terms of principles, of subject matters, of methods, or of ends. The two essays are ad- mirably complementary. Basic patterns of thought are discussed in articles on Axiomatization, Anthropomorphism in Science (which is related to analogy and metaphor as discussed elsewhere), Symmetry and Asymmetry (both in biology and in physics), Continuity and Discontinuity in Nature and Knowledge, and Structuralism. There are four essays on language, the Study of Language, Linguistics, Lin- guistic Theories in British Seventeenth-century Philosophy, and a very interesting one on Uniformitarianism in Linguistics, which shows connections between the developments in linguistic theory and those in geology and biology, providing some useful supplements to the articles on biology elsewhere. The remaining arti-</page><page sequence="11">MAPPING THE WORLD OF IDEAS 537 cles in the category, on Causation and on Casuistry, seem perhaps oddly placed, but again one must not take the division too seriously. Casuistry, discussed analytically and historically in an extemely well-done essay, earns its place here, presumably, as a methodological science for dealing with difficult problems in ethics, but the essay also contributes valuably to the history of Christianity and to the history of moral philosophy. Finally, an essay on Formal Theories of Social Welfare illustrates the application of scientific methodology to the social sciences. As one surveys this vast intellectual Golconda, it is natural to consider what riches the user can derive from it. Obviously, as one of the contributors has ob- served, it provides a liberal education at much less cost than a university. This is particularly true if the student uses the bibliographies at the end of each article. But he can also get a good deal of training in the discipline of the history of ideas. The discipline demands three qualities: the ability to analyze ideas and see their implications, the patience to document in detail the expression of ideas in his- torical texts, and the kind of historical imagination that can move out from the encircling grasp of its own intellectual and emotional milieu and enter into the thoughts and feelings of the past. These qualities are exhibited in varying degrees throughout this dictionary. A great many of the essays start with analyses of the concept to be dealt with, and these are uniformly excellent. Very often they ex- pose popular misconceptions or habits of loose thinking. Detailed documentation is naturally less completely illustrated, since most of the essays present the result of research rather than the process, but any reader will notice that there is a constant reference to documents, often, as in the essay on Nature, very extensive references, and very often, too, the writer, as in Astrology, makes clear what the documentary evidence will support and what it will not. Frequently an author will offer a lesson in sharp discrimination by pointing out the essential differences between ideas apparently similar, as the author of Nature does in the case of monks and Cynics. As to the historical imagination, it is displayed abundantly throughout these volumes. The final impression created by this work is one of immense respect, of im- mense appreciation. The list of contributors reads like a roll-call of a scholarly Hall of Fame, and they have taken their tasks seriously, giving their best. There is a remarkably high level of quality here, not only in the scholarship, but in the writing, which is almost universally extremely lucid, direct, and admirably free from unnecessary jargon, often elegant, and even witty. The writers all write as if they are enjoying their task, and this makes for enjoyable reading. Scholars will for many years give thanks to Mr. Charles Scribner, who first conceived of this work, and produced it so beautifully, to Professor Wiener, who planned and directed it, and to his colleagues and collaborators, who helped him bring it to triumphant completion.
