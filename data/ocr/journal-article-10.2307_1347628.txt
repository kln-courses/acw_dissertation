RICHARD J. CUMMINGS University of Utah ROBERT H. BROWN. Nature's Hidden Terror: Violent Nature Imagery in Eighteenth-Century Germany. Columbia: Camden House, 1991. 148 p. In the study of eighteenth-century German culture there are no concepts more vast, complex, or contradictory than those of nature and the natural. As a mirror in which eighteenth-century culture perceived, understood, and articulated itself, nature came to signify practically everything. In his concise study of eighteenth-century nature imagery in German literature, Robert Brown manages this chaos by focusing upon violent nature imagery as a literary code of social upheaval. The author examines the treatment of nature in late eighteenth-century German literature as metaphorical space for the emergence of the bourgeois class into the public, competitive, and capitalistic sphere. The introductory chapter offers a brief but informative outline of the socio- economic premises that gave rise to bourgeois culture. Brown then reiterates the anthropomorphism of nature, which places upon nature the myth of social significance. As carrier of absolute reality and moral content, this myth underwent a major shift during the eighteenth century, as its religious and metaphysical significance was replaced by secular and empirical understanding. Accordingly, violent nature "changed from an emblem of God's eternal order into the symbol of a changing world" (5). For Brown, the major impetus for such a shift was provided by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the cultural ramifications of which he examines in his second chapter. Contrary to popular assumptions, this disaster, Brown argues, did not so much destroy outright the faith in nature as a manifestation of divine providence as it galvanized the debate over the metaphysical optimism of Leibniz and Pope. This debate "finally discredited the metaphysical basis of philosophical optimism, which established individual experience as a dominant criterion of equality" (131). This triumph of empiricism led to a new signification of nature and its various manifestations. According to the book's central hypothesis, violent nature imagery was a major esthetic vehicle accompanying the dialectic of the emerging bourgeois culture. Along with its socio-political reforms and revolutions, its cultural renovations and discoveries, bourgeois culture generated alienation, isolation, and "an all-consuming struggle of all against all" (136). Antithetical to the catastrophic, idyllic nature is identified by Brown as the encoding of the old, holistic, and harmonious order. In the central three chapters of the study, the author engages this binary construct of idyllic 68</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews nature versus violent nature in a close reading of three major literary works of the Sturm und Drang: Gerstenberg's Ugolino, Goethe's Die Leiden desjungen Werther, and Schiller's Die Riuber. All three interpretive studies are supported by ample translated quotes, which are given in the original German in the footnotes. In the tragic drama Ugolino, Brown examines the nature motifs from the perspective of the Ugolino family, destined to starvation in the dungeon tower: "Nature's terror emerges, as the ideology of family intimacy gives way to competition among atomized individuals for power, property, and survival" (65). The best known work of the Sturm und Drang, Goethe's Werther, encodes the deterioration of Werther's psyche, as his individual and radically subjective experience of the world leads him inevitably into isolation, alienation, and self-destruction. Here, the myth of idyllic and Homeric nature representing the patriarchal ideal of harmonious society is juxtaposed with the wild and violent nature of Ossian. According to Brown, this "transformation of idyllic into violent nature imagery articulates the displacement of Werther's corporative ideal by his own non-corporative aspirations" (87). At times, Brown's binary construct of idyllic and violent nature representation runs the danger of appearing simplistic, deterministic, and capricious. Are there not, one is tempted to ask, literary works that encode the old, repressive, sometimes tyrannical order with violent nature imagery, and are there not literary works that reflect the new bourgeois social order- and its initial upheavals, like the French Revolution-in terms of a liberating, growing, and healing nature? Nevertheless, the paradigm of violent nature imagery is valuable for a socio- historical understanding of the eighteenth century, as well as for a literary interpretation of the specific works chosen by Brown. His central argument, that "where idyllic nature imagery reinforces static values, violent nature destroys their fixed settings, signifying ferment and change" (130), is an imaginative treatment of the dialectic of enlightenment, liberation, and revolution. This study is a readable and informative contribution to the discourse of eighteenth-century German bourgeois culture. RALPH W. BUECHLER University of Nevada, Las Vegas A. B. CHAMBERS.

In comparing Andrew Marvell's methodology to that of a Talmudic scholar who examines "every significant detail of the particular case in its relationship to all other relevant particulars" (3), Chambers is aptly characterizing his own approach in this stimulating volume. He scrutinizes primary texts and sifts through an enormous range of background material, mustering formidable evidence to support his central thesis that "the door through which Dryden 69</page></plain_text>
