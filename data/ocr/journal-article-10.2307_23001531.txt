<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. Sivaramamurti, Chitrasutra of the Vishnudarmottara Delhi: Kanak Publications, 1978, 232 pages, illustrated, Rs 210 During tbe past decades many scholars have been concerned with this important text. Scholars dealing with Indian art, especially painting, knew that the answer to many difficult problems both technical and aesthetic could perhaps be found in this text, and many attempts have been made to translate and explain it. But for various reasons the results have not been satisfactory. Even after the excellent critical edition of the Vishnudarmottara by Dr Priyabala Shah, which is part of the Gaekwad Series, the interpretation of a number of terms, expressions and even sentences were still in dispute. There are many reasons for this: the language of the sastras, for instance, was nearly always a corrupted form of Sanskrit, closer to a dialect used mainly by technicians than to the language of the elite or the intellectuals of the period; in addition, scholars have had to contend with various incomplete manuscripts which have survived through the years and in which the scribe not only repeated the mistakes of his predecessor but added new ones of his own. All this made the task enormously difficult. It is indeed fortunate for us that Dr C. Sivaramamurti found time to look at the text with a fresh perspective. His deep knowledge of Sanskrit is, of course, the basic reason for his ability to provide answers to the many points hitherto insufficiently understood or not understood at all. But Dr Sivaramamurti's exceptional fluency in the Sanskrit language (he speaks it better than many of us do our mother tongues) is not the only reason for this successful translation. There are other important factors:</page><page sequence="2">372 ELIKI ZANNAS Dr C. Sivaramamurti not only has a vast knowledge of the works of other authors on Indian art but also has a tremendous memory where every single fragment that he has ever seen has been registered and can be recalled at the required moment. He also has the capacity to correlate passages from Sanskrit literature to art pieces found throughout this vast continent, whether these be coins, or paintings, or sculptures, or any other form of art, spanning a period from 2,000 to 3,000 years. To that let me add something else: probably very few know that Dr C. Sivaramamurti is himself an excellent artist; he draws, paints and sculpts. This technical knowledge, lacking in most art historians, has undoubtedly been of great value in helping him interpret obscure passages from the Chitrasutra texts. In Chapter IV, 'Classification of Paintings', Dr C. Sivaramamurti gives one a convincing explanation for a different interpretation of certain technical terms; e.g., satya, vainika, nagara and misra. These are the four categories of painting according to the Vishnudarmottara. Dr Stella Kramrisch, who was the first to translate this important text, has explained 'satya' as realistic in an oblong frame; 'vainika' as lyrical in a square frame; 'nagara' as the citizen genre picture in a round frame; and 'misra' as mixed. Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy and Dr Moti Chandra gave more or less similar explanations, while Dr Priyabala Shah preferred a geographical explanation of these terms. Dr C. Sivarama murti, however, attempts to prove that the meaning of these terms is totally different. According to him the meaning of 'oblong', 'square' or 'round' cannot possibly be related to the frame, since mounting and framing paintings was not known in India. It concerns, he suggests, the depicted object and its proportions. For instance, 'satya' would correspond to figures that are slightly elongated below the waist, as are many of those found at Khajuraho and Ajanta. This elongation gives greater charm and dignity, especially to female figures, 'though the general proportions are never lost sight of.' Dr Sivaramamurti supports his theory by quotations from other Sanskrit texts both technical and literary. While 'vainika' was earlier interpreted 'as rich in postures, maintaining strict proportions, placed in an exactly square field, not phlegmatic, not very long and well-finished', it is now defined as being symmetrical, complete, with no elongation of any limbs nor exaggeration of form and in true proportion. Interestingly, it is from Khajuraho again that the author provides an example of 'vainika'; from the same temples we have examples of these two categories of painting. The author throws light on the iconographical positioning of a number of images which had not been understood. For instance, between the famous ashtadattu metal images of the Chamba school is the Narasimha of Brahmaur: a four-armed leonine face, a seated figure without any other attributes. This image is the only example yet found of this type, and has puzzled scholars. Now, in the Vishnudarmottara, Dr C.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 373 Sivaramamurti has found a special textual reference which he suggests is amazingly close to this form. In a similar way, the description of Varaha in the Vishnudarmottara is significant. It is certain that this has inspired both the zoomorphic form from Eran and the anthropomorphic form of Udayagiri, including the entire setting around him. Of course, stress is given to the proportions which are elaborately described as 'having adjusted proportions to proper measurements'. But what a detailed explanation is given for the technique of painting! Subtle subdivisions of what we today call 'chiaroscuro' are mentioned under the general term 'vartana', or 'shading to produce the illusory effect of depth on a flat surface ' The Chitrasutra tells us that this effect can be achieved in three ways: 'composed of lines cross-hatched in leaf pattern', or of very fine lines, or 'effected by stippling'. There is also an important Kannada work which confirms the interpretation of terminology gathered by the author from the Sanskrit text. The stages of an artist's work are also delimited step by step. After the proportions are fixed, and the tonal values arranged, a strong outline is drawn. At this stage there is an important discussion of colours and colouring that takes proportion and posture into account. Extremely interesting also is the discussion on the manipulation of colours, tones and values. There are five primary colours: white, red, yellow, black and green. Besides the lighter and darker tones of each colour, there are numerous very subtle shades corresponding to, and often obtained from, minerals or vegetable dyes. Even the colour 'black' is of varying degrees and grades. Chapter V gives a detailed account of the various conventions in painting; Dr C. Sivaramamurti calls it 'Pictorial Parlance'. These con ventions exist in all the arts. However, since painting demands the impossibility of representing volume—third dimension—such conventions on light and shade, on perspective and on foreshortening have developed. In miniature painting, regular examples of these conventions are to be found. For instance, the sky is suggested by a flight of birds. But which birds? Not just any bird but generally those of the season; e.g., cranes during the monsoon. Similarly, fishes, tortoises, turtles, swans, ducks, etc., represent water and so on. No technical or pictorial detail is left out, and everything is carefully explained. Bearing in mind that the text is a sutra (the latter often expressed in aphorisms and therefore condensed) it seems very precise. The book is published with care; there are practically no errors, and it is agreeable to read. Its weakness lies in the quality of its illustrations. I'm aware of the usual reason: the almost prohibitive cost of reproduction. But I feel there is no valid excuse for printing books on art where, as in the present one, much of the text has to be understood with the help of illustrations and photographic reproductions which are substandard.
