<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The World of the Walrus. By Richard Perry. Taplinger Publishing Company, New York. 1968. 162pp. $5.95. The walrus is most unusual in appearance and occupies a region which, until recently, was visited by relatively few adventurers, explorers, and com- mercial hunters. Quite understandably a signifi- cant portion of the early literature includes folklore and anthropomorphic interpretations of impression- istic observers. As Perry points out in his introduction, the pres- ent body of knowledge concerning walrus is frag- mentary and often contradictory. His stated objec- tive is to sort out the facts "in order to lay bare the unexpectedly remarkable truth of walrus life and society." Unfortunately, the book does not achieve this objective. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming stems from insufficient firsthand knowledge of the wal- rus and its environment, with the result that the author was himself unable to sort fact from infer- ence. In addition, there were several instances where erroneous statements were made, or hypoth- eses advanced to explain morphologic characteris- tics or behavioral traits recorded in the literature. Readability of the book is fair to poor due pri- marily to a somewhat rambling style of writing and poor organization of material included in the 16 chapters. Material taken from the literature is poorly referenced and misspellings occur in both scientific names and the names of authors. Despite the numerous shortcomings of this book, it is a compendium of findings by others about a most interesting and unusual animal. To that ex- tent it is a useful addition to any natural history library.-JOHN J. BURNs, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Nome. The Management and Conservation of Biologi- cal Resources. By John D. Black. F. A. Davis Company, Philadelphia. 1968. 339pp. $7.50. Although this book is intended for beginning stu- dents in wildlife conservation, it contains much in- formation useful to advanced students. The reader need not be technically inclined, for the book ex- plains all topics in simple matter using as little sci- entific terminology as possible. The book will therefore be used as a reference by many of the lay public and is also an excellent beginning text for wildlife conservation. A vast amount of knowledge has been synthe- sized and included in this publication. The author begins by describing the reasons why wildlife con- servation is needed. Basic information such as ele- mentary ecology, soil and water relationships with plants and animals, and the fundamentals of life are included early in this volume. Special chapters devoted to specific topics follow. These include grasslands, forests, fishes, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates, game, song, and predatory birds, game and predatory mammals, furbearers, and sev- eral others. All of these topics are brought together as an existing intricate relationship between each other. Throughout the book, the topics are dis- cussed from the point of view that all forms of life are dependent on each other for subsistence. Dr. Black has been professor of zoology at North- east Missouri State College for the last 14 years. He has written many articles for publication in various scientific journals. He received the "Con- servation Educator of the Year" award in 1967 given by the Missouri Department of Conservation, and has been active in conservation oriented or- ganizations for many years. This well written book by a truly great author is a monumental task itself. Its accurate informa- tion will go a long way in reaching the lay public as well as students in wildlife conservation.- RICHARD D. CRAWFORD, Northeast Missouri State College, Kirksville. Ecological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds. By David Lack. Methuen and Co., Ltd., Lon- don. 409pp. 1968. 84 shillings (In U. S.: Barnes and Noble, New York. $13.50). It is seldom that a new book crosses a reviewer's desk that leaves him with a feeling that a vast amount of hitherto discrete and disconnected ma- terial, culled from innumerable sources, has been given a new value, a more certain and a better oriented usefulness and that the future work of students in the area of its coverage will from then on have a firm basis from which to advance. This, in brief, is what David Lack's new volume does, and the more the present reviewer re-reads por- tions of it, the greater is his conviction that this is so. For many years, decades, even longer periods of time, ornithologists, particularly devoted amateurs, have published observations and data on birds of all families and of all parts of the world. Lack has spread his nets widely and effectively in this vast sea of print, and has evaluated and appraised with admirable discretion and critical interpretation, the multitude and variety of his "catch." The result is a book that students of avian breeding biology will find a reliable and comprehensive reference, and a stimulating basis from which to extend their inves- tigations. The volume deals with ecological adaptations only, and does not attempt to include purely be- havioral ones. This is something that many read- ers may regret, but it would have more than dou- 447</page></plain_text>
