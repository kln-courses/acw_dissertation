Belem: Conselho Nacional des Pesquisas, Instituto Nacional des Pesquisas de Amaz6nia Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, 1965. 88 pp., bibliography cited, foldout chart, 10 plates. n.p. (paper). Reviewed by BETTY MEGGERS, U. S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution One hundred and nineteen specimens in the Museu Goeldi collections form the basis for a new descriptive classification of Santar6m figurines. Three general categories are distinguished: anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and miscellaneous. Since 97.5 per cent of the examples are anthropomorphic, this category is further subdivided on the basis of differences in base form (crescent, unipod, circular, pedestal) and posture (standing, squatting, seated). A 19-page introduction reviews the history of Santar6m archeology and the distribution of figurines in South America and describes the general characteristics of Santar6m figurines-including others, as well as those forming the basis for the classification. A 60-page catalogue provides detailed descriptions of each figurine; 30 of them are illustrated in front, profile, and rear view on the plates. This small monograph is an example of the kind of useful contribution that can come from intelligent analysis of museum collections, even when provenience data are vague. Miss Corria's classification provides a new basis for analyzing the affiliations of the Santarem figurine style and is of potential value in reconstructing its origins. Such a comparative analysis is a logical sequel to this descriptive report, and it is to be hoped that she will undertake it in the near future.</page></plain_text>
