Brill, Leiden, 1952. xii + 150 pp. Eight plates and 79 in-text figures. ?2 10s. Dr. Bulling's book is a courageous attempt to relate some recurrent motifs and themes of early Chinese art to the astronomical lore, primitive ritual, and mythology, sophisticated speculation and theory, that appear so inextricably intertwined in the pre-Buddhist thought of China. The motifs, simple and therefore pervasive, which she considers, are circles and spirals, triangles, lozenge patterns; and the themes, more closely definable both in their appearance in art and hi the literary tradition, are tree and anthropomorphic patterns, tree-rites, constellation myths, and gods. In all these the author argues, with a mass of analogy and quotation, the dominant role of the star-gazer and calendar-maker, to the tacit and unusual exclusion of the phallus and ritual death. The argu ment proceeds, as it must, by induction and illustration. The just ness of some of the analogies adduced will certainly be questioned. For example, circles and lines on a Kansu neolithic urn are identified in symbolical meaning with a design of crossing lines with small circles at their intersections on a Han wall. But a few uncon vincing analogies such as this do not invalidate the explanation given in other cases. Regarding circles and spirals Dr. Bulling's most interesting l&gt;roposition is that some characteristic patterns on Kansu urns, consisting of circles separated by upright lines to which they are joined by festooned lines, are a schematic representation of garlanded posts set up for ritual performances that imitate the rotation of the heavens and thus the succession of the year. The kernel of the matter, which she cites at the end of her argument, is a passage in the T'ien Wen of Cli'u Yuan : " whereto the rotating ropes were fixed," followed by a mention of the Pole of Heaven in the following line. This may-pole interpretation is the most intriguing so far proposed for a design which certainly has an air of schematic representation, and therefore, in the author's sense, of symbolism. But other Kansu designs of circles joined by spiral lines have not this air, and some will think it is straining belief too far to explain these as conventional pictures as bobbins and lines, alternately wound and unwound in a ritual performance.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 103 The cosmological explanation applied on the other hand to such explicit diagrams as " flail" designs on late Chou Dynasty bronze mirrors, and to the designs on Corean lacquered bowls decorated with zodiacal animals in triple circles, is convincing; yet these instances do not help to prove that circles and spirals used decora tively on other and much earlier objects have any symbolic meaning worth the mention. One wonders, for instance, if it is legitimate to infer that groups of two, three, or four circles on Kansu urns " repre sent movements proceeding in the different horizontal layers of the sky" on the grounds that the lore speaks of an "icy wheel" turning in the Milky Way, and that the notion of a succession of nine heavens is found in ancient China (which shared it with other parts of Asia where the shamanistic mythology was current). The symbolical meaning the author imposes on simple forms might seem to imply an a3sthctic theory, even a fashionable one. But she does not concern herself with the role of symbolism in shaping artistic creation. The symbolism she discerns is rather a conscious record in banal symbols of cosmological-religious views publicly avowed. This accords with her contention that ritual plays representing the cosmic movements were a regular feature of Chinese life from the earliest beginnings to the Han period, and supplied the stock-in-trade of the craftsman's ornament. Here we touch on another interesting theme in which Dr. Bulling is a pioneer and on which she has discoursed at greater length elsewhere. The chapters on triangles and lozenges argue that these are symbols of cosmic mountains. Here, given the importance of holy mountains in Chinese lore, there is a rich material of analogy to draw on. While the Han examples of schematized mountains are readily accepted as such, the argument that similar Neolithic patterns represent mountains leaves one dissatisfied. The second half of the book, dealing with the more complex themes of the anthropomorphic god of ancient China and the tree rites, is most suggestive. The grounds given for linking the anthropo morphic patterns in some of the neolithic urns with the great gods T'ien and Shang-ti are convincing, but more original is the author's investigation of the pervasive tree-symbolism, culminating in the concept of "birth from the hollow tree". She argues that this is the explanation of an enigmatic character, often appearing on Shang-yin ritual bronze vessels, which has been variously but never convincingly interpreted in the past.</page><page sequence="3">104 REVIEWS OF BOOKS This book invites criticism on many points of detail, but the cumulative argument is impressive and marks a first step towards an understanding of the mentality underlying some of the queerer things in early Chinese art. In summarizing, however, the author goes beyond her premises. She refers to the similarity of cosmological conceptions of the ancient world, both in China and the Near East, and concludes that the " formative ideas behind the art of the different countries grew out of a common attitude towards the Universe ", all being coloured by " the doctrine of the unity of the macrocosm and the microcosm". That conclusion begs a great question. If it only means that primitive astronomy is everywhere similar, and that artistic motifs consciously based upon it have points of resemblance, it may raise no great objection, though we have not seen this demonstrated for the prehistoric and early historic world as a whole; and much, after all, has been said in favour of animistic and sexual interpretations. On the historical side of the problem (the study of symbolism makes disconcerting sport of the where and the when) a general criticism must be made of the presentation of the material. In China it ought now to be possible, particularly in view of the tabulated folk-lore published by Wolfram Eberhard, to distinguish between folklore proper and the all-embracing schemes of astronomer-ritualists and Taoist sophists. The former may slowly feed from the latter, and the latter builds on the former, but the two are surely not to be identified, any more than one should bundle together the speculation of the Ionian physiologoi and the darker liturgies of Orphism. In her book Dr. Bulling seems to place the truly primitive legends on a par with such concepts as the Five Emperors, the Five Elements, Yin and Yang, ideas which are definitely formulated, to judge from the texts, not before the latter part of the Chou period. We hope that in her future work Dr. Bulling will give her views on this aspect of the matter. The book is beautifully produced, with bibliography and index. Misprints, mainly of character transcriptions, are few. It is odd, in view of its role, that the earth branch wei is mistakenly written as mo. William Watson.</page></plain_text>
