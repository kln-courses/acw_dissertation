Eighty years of research have passed since this monograph was presented to the Academy. Facts have come to light of which no student in Petrie's 1 The frequent references which it will be necessary to make to Petrie's essay in the course of the present paper will cite it as Tara, followed by the number of the page, the place itself will throughout be referred to by its native name in the Middle-Irish orthography, Temair. 2 It is not, however, an unfair criticism that Petrie hardly acknowledges with justice the obligations he is under to O'Donovan's assistance. Perusal of the Ordnance Survey Letters shows that the descriptions and identifications, as well as the translations of the numerous Irish texts, are all due to O'Donovan. W.I.A. PKOC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. Cf [88]</page><page sequence="2">232 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. time could have had cognizance. Ancient texts, then hidden away in mss. almost or entirely inaccessible, have been published. A more rigid historical criticism has been applied to the documents of which Petrie made use, and to the interpretations which he and his contemporaries put upon them. The science of Anthropology in its several branches has come into being, shedding light on corners which to Petrie and his friends were totally obscure. In short, we have reached a stage where it seems profitable and desirable to review the whole subject. The topographical part of the present paper, which occupies Section 2, is entirely corrective or supplementary to Tara, and no details there given accurately are repeated here, unless some special circumstance makes it necessary. I have more than once read over the descriptions in Tara on the site itself, and have judged of their correctness with the actual remains before me. The views put forward in the later sections of this paper have been growing in my mind for some time. That they are at the moment " in the air" is shown by the fact that to a certain degree they have recently been anticipated in publication by my friend Dr. Josef Baudis, in an article published in Eriu.1 I am very glad that this scholar has come, quite independently, to the same conclusions as myself, as it encourages me to put forward my own suggestions with all the more confidence. Mr. A. B. Cook, in a series of articles published in Folk-lore? even earlier indicated similar conclusions. I would interpret some of the facts a little differently from my predecessors; and in the following study I endeavour, so far as possible, to avoid traversing the same ground as they have done. Practically all the points which they have brought forward were familiar to me, and would have been included here had their writings on the subject not seen the light. But it would not be reasonable, especially in these times of stress, to expect the Academy to reprint matter already accessible; and accordingly where work that has already appeared still holds good, I content myself with a simple reference. The study of the topography of the site must be based on that remark able geographical dictionary known as Dind-shenchas $renn. This document, with its wild folk-lore, may well seem a perilous quicksand on which to found what is intended to be a sober historical investigation. But the grotesque derivations of names, and the tales of sea-monsters and other impossible creatures, with which it is so largely concerned, must not blind 1 On the Antiquity of the Kingship of Tara: Eriu, vol. viii, p. 101. 2 The European Sky-God ; Folk-lore, vols, xv-xviii.</page><page sequence="3">Macalistkk?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 233 us to its practical value. Though its writer had his head filled with these frivolities, he was at least familiar with the topography of Temair. Even if we had not the evidence (such as it is) offered by the preface to the work in question, that it was actually compiled at Temair, we might have inferred this from the general accuracy of its descriptions of the several structures, and also from the fact that Temair occupies the first place among the localities of which it treats. The author wrote of Temair with Temair actually under his eyes, and, what is more important, under the eyes of his hearers, readers, and critics; and therefore, whatever we may think of his philology, there is the best of reasons for trusting his topography. Petrie made use of the account of Temair contained in this document, as of the poems interspersed through its prose. All of these materials are printed at length and translated in Tara. But since his time more satis factory editions, both of the prose and of the verse texts, have been issued? of the prose by Whitley Stokes,1 and of the verse by Mr. Gwynn.2 In the topographical description in Section 2 of the present study, the different sites are taken in the order in which they are enumerated in the prose text. For brevity this is referred to throughout by the abbreviation PD, with the number of the paragraph in Stokes's edition (thus, PD 20). The verse texts are referred to under the symbol VD, with the number of the poem in Gwynn's edition and the number of the line of the poem; thus, VD ii 20 means line 20 of poem no. ii. Of the five poems in VD, nos. i and ii are entirely historical, and contain nothing of topographical importance; no. iii is purely topographical, and contains a full list of structures, though with very scanty details regarding them ; no. iv is partly historical partly topographical, but relates to one building only (Tech Midchuarta); and no. v contains nothing but a metrical list of fortresses,3 &amp;c, which is of no service for our present purpose, and need not again be mentioned. Though I have used the printed editions for convenience of reference, I have not neglected the mss. on which they are based. Gwynn's edition of VD gives variant readings, but Stokes's edition of PD does not profess to be more than a transcript from one MS. (that at Rennes), and only a few variants are noted. I have carefully collated the Rennes text of the Temair 1 The Rennes Dind-shenchas in Revue celtique, xv : the portion relating to Temair will be found on pp. 277-289. 2 R.I.A. Todd Lecture Series, vol. viii, pp. 2-45, 57-79. 3 This poem seems to have been written during the usurpation of Brian Boroma by a supporter of the legitimate King Mael-Shechlainn : see lines 73-76. It indicates that there was still some sort of royal residence at Temair at that late date, in spite of the familiar tale of its abandonment after the curse of Ruadan. (See also Annals of Ulster, a.d. 1124, for the fall of a house in Temair on the king at that date.)

These manusciipts are hereinafter referred to under the following abbreviations:? R for the Rennes text; H for H 3 3, in Trinity College Library; U for the Book of Ui Maine; L and B for the Books of Leinster and Ballymote respectively. For the last two mss. I have used the R.I.A. facsimiles. I have to thank Sir James Frazer, Mr. P. Giles (Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge), Mr. E. J. Gwynn, and Dr. Bergin for allowing me to consult them on some questions that arose in the course of the work, and Mr. T. J. Westropp for accompanying me on two visits to the site, and for help in topographical study. I have specially to express rny acknowledgments to Mr. Arthur Bernard Cook, of Cambridge, who read over the greater part of this essay in MS., and made many valuable suggestions. 2.?The Topography of Temair 1. Nemnach Nemnach, according to PD 5, " is a well (tipra, in L firthipra), that is at the tumulus (sid) in the north-east of Temair (ind oirrthertuaiscert na Temrach)." Such is the reading of R, B, U, and H ; but 1 * reads desciurt for tuaiseert? " south " for " north," and this must be right. For, when we read further, we find that Tech Mairisend was north of Nemnach, and Raith Loeguiri north of that again; Nemnach must therefore have been south of Raith Loeguiri. The site of the last-named structure is fixed, being identified by its relation to the great Raith Rig; and no site south of Raith Loeguiri could be described as being "north-east of Temair." Petrie identified Nemnach with a spring that lies on the eastern slope of the hill, south of the modern village; the excellent source which supplies the modern village with water. It is just about east-north-east of the principal group of structures on the summit of the ridge.1 His chief argu ment for this identification was that "it is the source of a stream which has turned a mill on the site of the ancient one to the present day "; that is, to the time when Petrie wrote. The reference is to the well-known story told in YD iii 109-120, and also in PD 5, that upon a stream flowing from Nemnach was erected the first water-mill in Ireland, made by king Cormac for the benefit of his slave-girl Ciarnait, who was unable, owing to physical weakness, to carry out the heavy labour of grinding with the hand-quern. But this spring, which on the strength of Petrie's identification is marked Neamhnach on the Ordnance map, is not south of Raith Loeguiri; and a 1 Tara, p. 149.</page><page sequence="5">Maca lister?Temair Br eg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 235 writer in the Ordnance Survey Letters1 records the local tradition of the mill in a form quite different from that given by Petrie, namely, that Cormac's mill was on the river Gabhra in Blundelstown townland, " erected by- a Scotchman named Hand"(!) These facts do not strengthen the case for Petrie's identification. There is a spring, now much bemired by the trampling of cattle, at the south end of the ridge. It is marked " Well" on the twenty-five-inch map (Meath, sheet xxxi, 16). The six-inch map indicates it, but without any lettering. A streamlet flows eastward from it. The stream from Memnach flowed eastward, according to the L text of Dindshenchas Erenn (glassi bee theid [a N]emnig sair. The word sair is omitted in the other Dublin mss.). This spring would satisfy the conditions for identification with Nemnach better than the spring indicated by Petrie. True, VD iii 103 sqq. says, or appears to say, that Nemnach is east of Mur Tea, and that the houses of Temair were scattered around Tech Mairisend, which was on its margin. This, so far as it goes, would seem at first sight more favourable to Petrie's identification; for his Nemnach is close to the modern village, and is about east of the site of Mur Tea. But, in the first place, it is a mere assumption that the houses of the ancient village, which doubtless stood at or near the royal dwellings, were on the site of the modern village.2 In the second place, it is not certain that the passage before us really asserts that ISTemnach was east of the structure called Mur Tea; rather does it intend to say that it was east of the whole site of Temair, a condition satisfied by its being on the eastern slope of the ridge. Metrical exigencies prevented the author of the poem from saying that the well was south-e&amp;st of the settlement. The writer of PD had no such difficulties to contend with, and his version of the direction in which we are to look far the well is therefore to be preferred. Against Petrie's identification it may further be argued with fairness that, if it were sound, it would not be easy to understand why the author of PD mentioned Nemnach first in the list of notable places of Temair; while if the well were at the place now suggested, 1 O. S. Letters, Meath, pp. 143-4. 3 That there was such a village may be taken for granted : the^ royal establishrneiit would need servants, caterers, and other ministers, who would have to be housed in the neighbourhood. The well;known block of red enamel from Temair, now in the Royal Irish Academy's collection (Trans. R.I.A., xxx, 277; Journal Roy. Soc. Ahtiq. of Ireland, xii, p. 61), which was meant to supply material for enamel buttons to be pinned on to metal objects for their enrichment, is a proof that artificers in metal and enamel were established at Temair in the time of La Tene II, when this particular technique of enamelling prevailed.</page><page sequence="6">236 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Acadethy. it would naturally be mentioned first, being the first site met with in pro ceeding in the south-to-north direction which the author of PD follows. Had there been any trace of a tumulus on the edge of either of the springs, the identification with one or the other would be certain; for it was by such a tumulus or s/rf-mound that the well Nemnach was marked when Dind-shenchas Erenn was written. But the most careful search has failed to reveal any indication of such a mound. The earth around both springs has been cultivated, as the marks of furrows clearly show ; and the tumulus has been annihilated. The former existence of this sid is doubtless an indica tion that the waters of Nemnach, like those of the other springs of Temair, were sacred. The stream that flowed from Nemnach bore the name Nith, according to PD 5. This must be distinguished from the better-known river of the same name, in Mag Murtheimne, on the borders of which were the winter-quarters of the revisers of the Senchas Mot j1 even although that document speaks of Nith nemundach, "pearly Nith." The same combination of words occurs elsewhere. Thus, in the quatrain describing the river-bursts that took place in the reign of Sirna Soeglach, forming part of the poem beginning Sima Soeglach, saer in fldith, we read? Tomaidm Scivtige na re', ocus toniaidm Buailte na re* ro mebaid immach Nith nemnaide nemannach. " The burst of Scirtech in his time, and the burst of Doalt; in his day burst out Nith, brilliant and pearly " (LL 19 b 1, LLec 581 a). This suggests that the combination of words was so familiar that the one unconsciously called the other to recollection. We find the same or a similar combination in Cormae's Glossary. Under the word Neit, " a pagan Irish god of battles," we read of his consort Neman] and the next article but one in the Glossary is nith, "mortal wounding." 2. Tech Mdirisend "The site of the House of Mairisiu (Idthrach Taigi Mdirisend) is over the tumulus that is northward from Nemnach, with three small stones round it. In this wise was that house established, with a lofty floor and a very low tuarad. Mairisiu was a widow who was in Temair2 at the same time as Cormac. Every house that is established in that manner will not be gloomy, and will not be without riches in it." So says PD 6; a paragraph that calls for most minute attention. VD iii 97 sqq. speaks of it as "chief for beauty 1 Ancient Laws of Ireland, Rolls ed., i, 2. 'A The words " in Temair " are in H only.</page><page sequence="7">Maoalistkr?Temair Br eg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 237 of Ireland; a height in the west, a great height in the north, a low level away from it eastward1?a noble excellence.1' Such are the materials that we have for the study of this interesting building, of which not a vestige now remains. From these passages we learn?(1) that Tech M&amp;irisend was already in ruins when Dindshenchas Erenn was compiled; (2) that even in its ruined state it was understood to have been of an unusual design, though the descrip tion is not so clear as we might have wished; (3) that it was considered a lucky model to follow, and that houses built after the same pattern were blessed with prosperity and happiness. But why ? Assuredly because the House of Mairisiu was something more than merely the residence of an otherwise undistinguished widow. For PD records three further remarkable facts about it: (1) it was built above a tumulus ; not a place, I venture to assert, where any ordinary person con temporary with Cormac would willingly dwell;2 (2) it was just beside Nemnach, the holy well; (3) there were three small stones round about it.3 What were these three stones ? There is not a house in Ireland, ancient or modern, in whose neighbourhood three small stones could not be found; why then are the stones round the house of Mairisiu men tioned? Clearly because they had some special significance. In all pro bability they were the remains- of a stone circle that girdled the site of the house. We need not assume that these clocha becca were mere insignificant pebbles; the same expression is used of the stones called Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne, which, as we shall see, must have been of some considerable size. The name Mairisiu, also written Mairiseo,4 does not appear anywhere else, so far as 1 have been able to discover. We are told that the owner of the name was a widow of the time of Cormac; it is, however, evident that 1 This seems to bo the meaning of the Irish, ard aniar, hard atiiaid. | isel itad sair. The first line might mean, as Gwynn has translated, *' it was high in the west, very high in the north" ; but the second line can only mean " there was a low level away from it eastward," so that an analogous translation seems to be required for the preceding words. What this implies will be considered later. 2 On the other hand, the presence of a sid-mound seems to have been considered an advantage for what may be called the sacred or official structures of the site. Such a mound is incorporated with the building here called Cormac's House ; the great ring of Raith Rig has been deflected to include another ; a third forms part of Raith na Senad, in which I am inclined to see M\ir nOllomhan, the original assembly-hall of Feis Tem rach; and a fourth is incorporated with the south wall of Tech Midchiiarta, the later assembly-hall. See the different articles in which these structures are described. 3 This is the reading of L (itnbe). H reads and ("in it"). R, B, U omit the word altogether. 4 The mark of prolongation over the a is sometimes omitted. The name appears as Muh'iusc in H.</page><page sequence="8">238 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the sentence which contains this information (Mairisiu dono, hantrebthach bae i comre fri Cormac) is no part of the original text, but a marginal gloss which has become incorporated with the passage at an early stage of the history of Dind-shenchas Erenn. It breaks awkwardly into the sense of the passage in which it is inserted. In any case, the statement that Mairisiu was a widow of the time of Cormac is insufficient to account for the pecu liarity of construction of her house, for its very singular situation in the middle of a sacred circle and beside a ghost-haunted tumulus, and for the luck said to attend houses similarly built. We are probably to see here either a confusion, or an evasion, on the part of the author or of his glossator. In the former case, the writer of the sentence must have had in his mind another widow of Temair, who figures conspicuously in the legends of Cormac?namely Cainech (aliter Bennaid), the owner of the sheep which Cormac tended while exiled from his kingdom.1 But it is more probable that we are to see here an evasion. The conscientious Christian who wrote the note was doubtful as to the desirability, or the legitimacy, of perpetuating unalloyed the beliefs of paganism. Suppose that Mairisiu was, in the ancient creed, something more than human?her uncanny choice of a dwelling-place would accord with this?the waiter might well feel a hesitation in recording the heathen beliefs about her, So, instead of saying that she was a goddess, he put down the first thing that came into his head, possibly suggested by a floating recollection of the story of Cainech.2 If Mairisiu was originally a goddess, we can better understand why her house, i.e., her temple, was erected over a tumulus, beside a sacred well, and within a stone circle. We can also understand the complete destruc tion, not merely of the house (which might have been of wood, and have perished by the ordinary processes of decay), but also of the sid, which would be practically indestructible without intentional violence. For the conscience of the writer of Dind-shenchas Erenn, or of his glossator, would hardly have given trouble if the worship of Mairisiu had wholly disappeared, and had become merely a matter of antiquarian interest in his time.3 There were 1 Lebor Gabcila. 2 A " house of Cairnech (sic) on the Road of Assal"?that is the road running westward from Temair?is called Tech commairce hErenn, "the house of protection of Ireland," in the Triads (Todd Lect., xiii, p. 2). What may be meant by " house of protection " is not quite clear ; hardly, perhaps, a sanctuary in the mediaeval sense of a place where refugees are protected from justice. There is clearly a confusion between (1) Cainech, (2) Cairnech, and (3) Mairisiu on the one hand, and (a) the protection-house of Cairnech and (6) the luck-bringing house of Mairisiu on the other. The situations of the two houses are incompatible. Possibly Giamait and her mill are part of the entanglement. 3 This point is worth a foot-note. It is often said that it is difficult to discover the pagan beliefs of ancient Ireland from the literature, because they have been purged out</page><page sequence="9">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 239 still Mairisiu-worshippers in Ireland; and therefore it was at some time considered necessary by the ecclesiastical authorities to demolish the structure in which the worship centred. ....o?. * TECH MAlAlSENO ^^ffif i' % * o -H p * * Plan Fig. 1.?Restoration of the House of Mairisiu. The last question which presents itself with regard to the house of Mairisiu is its design. The obscurity of the description in PD is not lessened by a succession of scribes, by whom the documents have been transmitted to us. This is not wholly correct. The purgation took place once for all, when the literature was being written down for the first time in its present form, and while paganism was still a force to be reckoned with. The scribes would not take the trouble to eliminate dead gods. Jl.I.A, PBOC., VOL. XXXIV, S3SJOT. C. [34]</page><page sequence="10">240 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. by our ignorance of the meaning of the technical term tuarad, on which all the mss. are agreed, with slight differences of spelling.1 It probably denotes some part of the roof. But, leaving to future discoverers to find out what the " very low tuarad " of the house may have been, we note that the build ing had "a lofty floor" (Idr ard). We can guess why the floor was raised aloft with the help of the description in VD. According to this account there was a height in the west, and a great height in the north, but a low level to the east. To explain this, we must remember that the house was built over or against a tumulus. The top of the mound (the " great height") was to the north, the slope of the mound to the west; east of the house was the natural level of the ground. As the slope of the mound would encroach on the ground-level of the house built against it, the floor would have to be raised in order to obtain a space of sufficient breadth. The diagram (fig. 1) is an attempt to represent the general lines of a building that would answer to the conditions. A structure, thus cleverly adapted to an awkward site, might well be considered a " mason's triumph," if that could be the meaning of sder-hiaidr; and a person building his own house after the model of the "Temple of Mairisiu" might be supposed to be placing his household under her protection. Whatever may be thought of these conjectures, it can at least be claimed that they afford a not unreasonable explanation of certain statements so remarkable that some explanation is urgently called for. 3. Edith Loeguiri meic Neill This structure, which Petrie has satisfactorily identified,3 had four doors ("chief doors", primdoirsi, in L, U, and H). It does not appear whether these doors were in the surrounding rampart or in the enclosed building; probably the latter. The rampart is too much ruined to allow us to deter mine the number and nature of its entrances; indeed, on the western side, almost half of the ring is totally wiped out of existence. According to PD 7 the grave of Loeguire was " against the outer south eastern rampart of the royal raith " (frisin clod imechtraeh n-airther-deiscer tach na rig-rdtha); that is, presumably, outside the rampart, and on the south-east side. Petrie cites a passage from Lebor na hllidri in confirmation of this statement, but it is probably not independent of PD: the two passages seem to be drawn from a common source. VD gives a different situation for the grave. Three members of the monument are there enume 1 Tnard, L ; tuaradh, R. The word seems to be a axra| wyoftci/ov. 3 See Gwynu's note ad loc, VD iii 100. 3 Tara, pp. 150, 168,</page><page sequence="11">Macalistkr?"temair Rreg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 241 rated (VD iii 93-96): Raith Loeguiri (the inner dwelling); Les Loeguiri (the enclosure surrounding the inner dwelling, with its rampart); and Lecht Loeguiri, the grave, which was for lar a lis, "on the platform of his less.'' There is not the slightest external indication of the sepulchre; only an extensive excavation could determine its position. The rampart was double; but this does not now appear, except at one spot on the eastern side, just south of a deep gravel-pit that has been dug into the entrenchments. It is not quite easy to see the meaning of the statement contained in the passage quoted by Petrie from Dehor na hUidri1 that, at the time of Patrick's interview with king Loeguire, " Raith Loeguiri was Tech Midchuarta." Does this mean that Cormac's great building had already fallen into ruin, and that the king's raith had been adapted as a substitute? Though Temair was from the Bronze Age the site of a cemetery, it is noteworthy that very few of its kings wrere buried on the spot. The tract Senchas rrn Relec states that only three kings were there interred?Conaire, Loeguiri, and a third, whose name the scribe has omitted (Dehor na h Uidri, facs., 51 b 1). 4. Lecht Mata Mor-glondaig We learn from PD 8 that the monument was beside Raith Loeguiri, to the south-east (hi toeb rdtha Loeguiri anairdes). VD makes no reference to it. There is no trace of any monument now existing in the place indicated; most likely it was a standing stone, as were the majority of the other lost monuments. This is what we might have expected : for there are few quarries in the neighbourhood, so that stone is in demand for building; and, moreover, as the stone monuments seem to have been objects of pagan worship rather than mere grave-marks, their disappearance after a change of religion is easily accounted for. On the other hand, few forms of ancient structure are more enduring than earthen mounds, when they are not destroyed with intention. There are two versions of the story of Mata told in the mss. of Dind shenchas Erenn, and there is also some uncertainty as to his name. All the Dublin MSS. call him Mata2; but, according to Stokes, R reads Niata. This is probably an error: as Niata had some such meaning as " champion-like," the corruption would be easy. Whatever his name, he is said to have been a ravaging warrior (amus hrathertach) of the time of Cormac. " One day there were four warriors (occloech) playing beside Raith Loeguiri on the south east, and Mata pushed them all four into the ground above the narrow parts 1 Tara, p. 170 ; see also Revue celtique, vi, pp. 162 sqq. 2 Matta in L, Mada in U, H. [34 *J</page><page sequence="12">242 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. of their waists." The tale has come down to us in a condition too fragmen tary for us to make much of it; but, even in its mutilated condition, it presents one or two noteworthy points. In the first place, it involves either an anachronism, or an indication that Raith Loeguiri was not originally built by the king whose name it bears. It must have been in existence some two centuries before the time of Loeguire, if the unlucky warriors con temporary with Cormac were playing a game outside its walls. In the second place, the tale bears a close family resemblance to the legend of how Conall Cernach found two youths playing with the head of Cu-Chulaind; indeed, so far as the scanty materials before us permit us to judge, we may reason ably regard the one story as a by-form of the other. As in the case of Mairisiu, we may suspect here a confusion of some kind: a tale, properly belonging elsewhere, is told to account for a monument of which the true origin had been forgotten. And it need scarcely be pointed out that it does not account for the monument! L gives us a different version of the story, which is, if anything, even more corrupt and obscure. Here only one of the four seems to have been singled out as a victim, and Mata cast a stone " so that the warrior died of it.;' This does not help us much. So far as I am aware, the name Mata is not found elsewhere in any con nexion with Cormac and his cycle. It reappears in literature, however, as that of a great monster closely connected with the Boyne valley. Among the remarkable places of Brug na Boinne, Dindshenchas Erenn enumerates Lecht in Matae (the grave of the Mata); Glend in Matae (the valley of the Mata); Lecc Bend, ' the stone on which the Mata was slain "; and Duma na Onam, " the mound of [the Mata's} bones."1 In the article on Ath Cliath Cualann (Dublin), in the same compilation, we learn that the men of Ireland^ after slaying the Mata on Lecc Bend, threw its bones into the Boyne. The colptha, or shin-bone, was washed down to the sea at the Boyne estuary, whence it has its name, Inber Colptha; while the ribs were washed south to the Liffey estuary, and the " hurdles," which gave its name to the ford Ath Cliath, were made from them. Opinions seem to have differed as to the appearance of the Mata. FD* says that it had seven score feet and seven heads, or that it was "a sort of tortoise3"; but VD,4 while retaining the seven score feet, allows it only four heads. This poem tells us that it " licked up the Boyne/' and that, in some unexplained way, " the sin of Adam's wife " was responsible for its existence. Here, then, we have a tradition of a great hydra-like monster, whose heme 1 Revue celtique, xv, 292. - Jbid., p. 329. 3 Ibid., p. 292. * Todd Lecture Series, x, p. 100.</page><page sequence="13">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 243 seems to have been in the valley of the Boyne; and I am inclined to suspect that the " monument of Mata " at Temair was originally in some way asso ciated with this creature. In a more rationalistic age the story of the monster became dim, and somehow became mixed up with the tale of Conall Cernach and the youths who desecrated the head of Cu-Chulaind. Finally, Mata became a warrior, and, like most of the traditions hovering round Temair, was assigned to the time of Cormac mac Airt. A suggestion may be hazarded as to the origin of the legend of the Mata, or, rather, as to the reason of its localization in the Boyne valley. The monster was closely associated with the great cemetery of Brug na Boinne, the most conspicuous monument in which is the mound now called New Grange. One of the most noteworthy features of New Grange is the great stone that lies in front of the entrance, bearing an elaborate serpentine pattern of spiral scrolls. Is it too much to suggest that this sculpture helped to fix in Brug na Boinne the tradition of a mighty dragon ? The stone of Mata at Temair may possibly have borne similar sculpture. This is the more pro bable on account of the intimate connexion which appears to have existed betwen Temair and New Grange, as we hope to show in a later section. The adjective mor-glondach is applied in the Dindshenchas of Bri Leith1 to the s/rf-prince Midir, in a story which, at least indirectly, connects that personage with Temair and with a certain Liath. We shall find this latter name figuring in the early legendary history of Temair. How far it is possible to see here some trace of a confusion one can hardly undertake to say; the two names, Mata and Midir, are obviously too remote from one another in form and in sound to have any radical connexion. But I confess myself unable to believe that the rules of the philologists are of the mathe matical inflexibility claimed for them, when proper names are concerned, and when we have to deal with the folklore of illiterate or semi-literate peoples. In a folk-tale from Co. Leitrim the expression "Bull of Norroway" has become corrupted to "Bull of Oranges "?a familiar word being substituted for one unknown to the narrators.2 In the face of this we may be prepared for almost any perversion of proper names. 5. Raith Rig Raith Rig3 "is beside Raith Loeguiri to the north" (PD 9). Its identi fication with the enormous enclosure on the summit of the ridge is beyond dispute. Only one rampart can be traced; it is possible that there was an 1 Revue celtique, xvi, 78. 3 Folk-lore, iv, pp. 193, 194. 3 Almost always written thus, without the definite article preceding rig.</page><page sequence="14">244 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. inner rampart of stone, which has now disappeared, as Mr. Westropp suggested to me when we visited the site together. According to PD, Raith Rig contained three notable things: Tech Cormaic, Lathrach in Forraid, and Mur Tea. These have now to be separately considered. 6. Tech Cormaic The first of the " three notable things " in Raith Rig was the site of the House of Cormac (lathrach Taigi Ohormaic). VD makes no reference to this structure. PD says of it that it is ind oirther-descert na rdtha illeith fri Rdith Loegtciri fodes, " in the south-east of the raith, in the side towards Raith Loeguiri southward." This is very hard to understand. There is no trace of any structure in any spot that could be so described; the suspicion is aroused that there is some old and deep-seated corruption in the text at this point. The only other guide which we have to the identification of Tech Cormaic is the further statement in the same paragraph of PD : lathrach in Forraid hi tdeb lathraige Taigi Ohormaic anoir. This reading of R is followed, with a few trifling orthographical and other variations, by all the Dublin MSS.; the only difference of any importance being the omission of anoir in U. The sentence means " the site of the Forrad is beside the site of Cormac's House eastward": uch being the idiomatic signification of anoir, which literally means "from the east." Now there are two conspicuous monuments near the middle of Raith Rig, side by side, lying east and west: and if we are not to see in them the Forrad and Cormac's House, respectively, we may abandon at once all endeavour to identify the remains of Temair with the help of the literature. Petrie has so identified them ; but he has committed a strange oversight: he has reversed them, identifying the eastern mounds with Cormac's House, and the western mound with the Forrad. On p. 138 of Tara he gives a translation of the passage in PD, rendering anoir correctly; but on p. 156 he says "the ruins of the Forrad, which were alongside the House of Cormac, and to the west "?an error subconsciously induced by his ideas as to the identification of the two structures. The name Forrad is explained in O'Clery's Glossary, s.Y.fortha,1 as ionad suidhe, " a place for sitting." We may compare the English expression, " the seat of Lord X," meaning his residence. The Forrad at Temair would thus have been the original royal dwelling, and would clearly be older in date than the House of Cormac. It would therefore be natural, at first sight, 1 Revue celtique, iv, 424. The word is given in the plural form, Joradha, A. itmaid suidhe. O'Clery spells the word with one r; the mss. of Dmd-shenchas Erenn as a rule use two.</page><page sequence="15">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 215 to suppose that the structure which most nearly occupies the middle of the great enclosure is the Forrad, and that the earthworks to the side of it represent the later Tech Cormaic. This is what Petrie has done. But when we examine the remains more critically we see that the judg ment must be reversed. The central building is the later of the two. Each structure is surrounded by a group of circular ramparts. The ramparts of the side structure are complete. Those of the central structure are inter rupted, butting against the ramparts of the side structure. (See the plan of Temair, Plate VII.) This evidently shows that the side structure existed first, and that the central structure was a later addition. The identifications made by Petrie must, therefore, be interchanged: his Tech Cormaic becomes the Forrad, and his Forrad becomes Tech Cormaic. This brings the remains into accordance with the Dind-shenchas. As Mr. Westropp, with whom I discussed this question on the spot, pointed out to me, the building here identified with the Forrad, though not occupying the centre of Raith Rig, is situated on the summit of the ridge, while the added building, here called Tech Cormaic, is on the western slope. This is an additional argument in favour of the identification. Further, it is more than probable that the great ring of Raith Rig is really due to Cormac, built when he added his house to the original structure. His gigantic Tech Midchuarta shows him to have been a man with a bent for grandiose architectural conceptions; and he may well have conceived the idea of the enormous fence drawn about his house. The unprecedented magnificence of Cormac's additions to the buildings of Temair are extolled in the tract Coimpert CormaicA If we assign the ram part of Raith Rig to him, the central position of his House becomes at once intelligible.2 Some time after the above paragraph had been written, I chanced to light upon a passage in Esnada Taigi Buchet which I had quite forgotten,3 and which definitely ascribes the building of the great Raith to Cormac. We are there told that when he was laying it out he encroached upon the property of one Odran, and a curious story is related of Odran's very natural protests, and the way in which he was compensated I suspect that Odran is borrowed, name and all, from Oman the Jebusite,4 who had a somewhat analogous encounter with king David, and in any case, he can hardly be 1 Silva Gadelica, i, 255 ; ii, 289. 2 It will be observed that the ring is laid out, not in the usual circular form, but as an oval. The intention of this appears to be to include the two burial-mounds, Duma na nGiall, and, especially, Mur Tea, within the compass of the Raith. . 3 The passage will be found in the prose text, Revue celtique, xxv, 26, and in the verse, Zeitsch. celt. Phil., viii, 264. 4 X Chronicles xx\.</page><page sequence="16">246 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. historical. The story, however, testifies clearly to an early tradition ascribing the building of Raith Rig to Cormac. We, therefore, here describe as Tech Cormaic the structure hitherto called the Forrad. This great flat-topped mound, which resembles the huge mound of Cruachu, doubtless served the same purpose?that is to say, it was a foundation on which the king's house was built. 7. Forrad There is nothing of importance to add to Petrie's account of this struc ture, which he calls the House of Cormac. It may, however, be worth noting that the site of the house itself is clearly marked in the centre of the enclosure. It is about thirty feet square, which is roughly about the size specified for the house of an Ard-ri in Grith Gablach.1 The size of the rampart, however, does not accord with the seven score feet prescribed for such structures by the same authority. In VD i 37, Forad na rig, " seat of the kings," is used as a name for the whole of Temair. 8. Mur Tea The third of the wonders of Raith Rig was Mur Tea. We must shed off our not unnatural prejudices when we approach the question of what and where was Mur Tea. The crazy structure of Anglo-Israel is built on the Tea myth ; and no one who cares for Temair, and who has seen the wreckage of Raith na Senad, can suffer that folly gladly, or otherwise. And the pre posterous derivation, Temair = Mur Tea,2 is enough to make us believe that Tea and her " wall" are entirely late etymological inventions. But it must not be forgotten that the literary evidence for the existence of some structure, which (evidently for the sake of the derivation just quoted) our authorities called Mur Tea, is just as strong as that for the other recorded buildings of Temair, extant or lost. The site of " Tea's'Wall" is described in the same document as are the other sites, and in similar language; and we are not justified in ignoring the description in this case while we accept it in the others. We turn back therefore to PD 9, where we read: Mur Tea illeith fodes, conid dosam rohainmniged Temair, ,i. Tea Mur .i. in cnocc lecc fil eter na da mur i leith buddes, is and atd?literally "The Rampart of Tea in the side southward, so that from it was named Temair, that is Tea Mur; the little hill that is between the two ramparts in the side southward, it is there it is." 1 Ancient Laws of Ireland, iv, 336. 2 It is fair to say that this is not much worse than Teach-mdr, which is given as the derivation of the name in a well-known modern work on Irish archaeology.</page><page sequence="17">Macalister?Temair Br eg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 247 This is the reading of R, B, H, and U : though the last-named ms., by an accidental lipography, has dropped the first four words.1 L inserts eturru "between them"' after the opening words Mur Tea?"them" being the Forrad and Tech Cormaic, described in the sentences immediately preceding. The same MS. also interpolates an intrusive gloss, explaining who Tea was, enumerating the previous names of Temair, and stating that the site received its present name because Tea was buried etir lathrach ind Foraid 7 ind Rigthaige, " between the site of the Forrad and of the Royal House." In the current section we are concerned with the topography only, so that we must not at present follow up the side issues raised by this note, such as the previous names of Temair or the personality of Tea. These are subjects for later consideration. We therefore concentrate our attention on the nature and position of Mur Tea. The first thing which we notice is that the ramparts surrounding Tech Cormaic and the Forrad are actually in contact, and there is, therefore, no room for any structure between them; it follows that there must be something wrong withL's reading eturru,&amp;n&amp; with the asser tion based upon it in the interpolated gloss. Looking back to the other MSS., which omit eturru, we see that Mur Tea was a hillock (owe becc), that is, a burial tumulus, which is just what we should expect it to be from the legends associated with it. Such a structure would not naturally be described as a mur. We are therefore justified in concluding (as has already been suggested) that the name current in our authorities is artificial, devised in the interests of their etymology of the name Temair.2 We learn further that it was situated between two ramparts, and that it was south of something ? presumably at the south side of Raith Rig itself. It has apparently never been noticed that in the very place indicated?at the south side of the Raith and just inside the great rampart?there is a slight rise in the ground, which has all the appearance of being the base of a levelled mound. Its diameter is about 33 feet, and its place can be fixed by the following compass-bearings3:? To Trim Yellow Steeple, ....... 278? To a gap in a plantation of trees on a hill to the north-east, . 330D To the statue of St Patrick,. 30? To the south-east pinnacle of Tara Church Tower, . . 40? 1 The scribe has, indeed, omitted the whole of the previous description of the Forrad ; his eye having wandered from/odes, which in the text precedes that description, to the same word in the sentence quoted above. - A more suitable, perhaps the original, name (Lecht Tea) is preserved in a line of a poem quoted in O'Clery's Glossary, s. v. toinneamh. See Revne celtique, v, p. 57. 3 Taken with a prismatic compass in the middle of July, 1917. r.i.a. proc, vol. xxxiv, sect. c. [35J</page><page sequence="18">248 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. I have no doubt in my own mind that this is the trace of the tumulus called Mur Tea, and regarded as the grave of the eponymous foundress of Temair. Such a place would naturally be an especially "gentle " spot; and it is not surprising that when Cormac stood upon it alone one day he had a vision of the sid- folk.1 It may be more than a mere coincidence that the traditional grave of the foundress holds roughly the same position relative to Rdith Rig that the grave of Loeguire is said to hold with regard to the fort which bears his name. For the topography of Mur Tea we are entirely dependent upon PD. There is some valuable traditional matter in VD to which we must return later, but nothing to throw light on the appearance of the mound. It is, however, worth passing notice that VD i 33-36 contrasts the house (tech) of Tea, round which was a rampart, with her grave outside the rampart (roadnacht iar miir amuig), showing that there were two sites associated with the princess. The house was presumably identical with the Forrad, the grave with the tumulus here described. The " rampart " here mentioned is of course that of the Forrad, not the later-built Raith Rig. 9. Caprach Cormaic Caprach Cormaic was a well fo toeb Rat ha na Rig anoir, " under the side of Raith Rig eastward " (PD 10). According to VD iii 122, it was i Raith Uig, 6 Raith Rig sair " in R.R., from R.R. eastward." This coincides with the posi tion of the spring identified by Petrie with Nemnach. Remembering that the name " Cabragh" still survives in the townland next to that containing Petrie's Nemnach,2 I suggest that Petrie's identification was wrong, and that the spring in question was really Caprach Cormaic. Caprach apparently means " a roofed building."3 Very likely the well was covered with some protecting structure from which it derived its name?just such a covering, in fact, as still roofs it over. Petrie professed himself unable to discover Caprach Cormaic. He says (Tara, p. 166), for no very satisfactory reason, that it must have been south of Nemnach; but on his restored map of the site he places it to the north-east of his Nemnach ! Caprach Cormaic had three other names, as PD goes on to tell us: Liaio* 1 Irische Texte, iii, 193. 2 The well is now in Castleboy townland ; but the mearing of Cabragh comes to within 100 feet of the spring. Indeed, there is a sort of projection jutting out from the main area of Cabragh towards the spring ; it looks as though Cabragh had originally been laid out to include the site of the well, but that a subsequent encroachment of Castleboy had cut it out. See the townland boundaries as indicated in the plan, Plate VII. 3 So Meyer, Contributions to Irish Lexicography, with a query.</page><page sequence="19">Macalister? Temair lir eg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 249 (Liaig na Fian in H), Tipra Bo Finde, and Derc Dub. VD iii 125 gives the three names rather differently: Liaig Dail Duib Duirb, Tiiath Linde, and Tipra Bo Finde: it also speaks of the well (iii 123) as Topur Tuirme Cland, which looks like a fourth name. These names, though obscure, and perhaps corrupt (as Gwynn suggests in his note ad loc), are very suggestive. Liaig, " Physician," indicates a medico-magical spring of some kind. Tipra Bo Finde must refer to some sacred white cow. Derc Dub, " black eye," may be merely a descriptive name, applied to the dark waters; while Topur Tuirme Cland, " the well of numbering of clans," is, as we shall see, a name or expression very suggestive in the light of certain traditions regarding the foundation of Temair. I am, indeed, inclined to suspect that the sacredness of the ridge of Temair has its roots in the beautifully pure waters that flow richly from this particular spring. It is now called St Patrick's Well: is " Patrick " here a popular corruption of " Caprach "? PD tells us that there was a proverb current, Ni taet a laeg go liaig, which would mean literally " its calf does not go to a healer "?Laeg being the name of another spring on the opposite slope of the ridge. The proverb evidently meant that two incompatible things do not associate together. But I suspect that the writer of PD has corrupted the saying, the jingle of laeg and liaig having proved too tempting for him ; and that the original version was ni toet a loeg co boin find, " its calf does not go to a white cow." This emendation adds point to the proverb, and explains the otherwise meaningless little word a before laeg. Possibly the " Calf" well was supposed to be actually an outflow from the well of the " White Cow." The latter animal may be identified with Glas Temrach, the Grey [Cow] of Temair, which gave its name to the next site that we meet with. It may also be the same as the White Cow after which the River Boyne is named. According to Wilde,1 this spring was "formerly shaded by a magnificent ash-tree." May this have been the scion of an ancient sacred tree, planted by the holy well ? 10. Duma na Bo The " Mound of the Cow" was westward from Duma na nGiall (PD 11). VD iii 90 calls this monument Cnoc Bo, and says that it was " downward from Raith Rig (fri R.R. anis), which would suggest that it was outside, not inside, the rampart. It is curious that PD does not enumerate either Duma na Bo or Duma na nGiall among the decern or " notable things " of Raith Rig. 2 Beauties of Boyne and Blachwater, 2nd edn., p. 125. [35*]</page><page sequence="20">250 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The identification of Duma na Bo is a problem of some difficulty. Duma na nGiall is conspicuous enough. West of it Petrie marks on his map, and describes,1 a mound 6 feet high and 40 feet in diameter at the base, which he calls Duma na Bo. Notwithstanding the most careful search neither Mr. Westropp nor I could discover the slightest trace of it. I find it hard to believe in the total disappearance of so large an earthwork within the past eighty years; even treasure-diggers would have left some trace of their nefarious work. If it were not conspicuous on the old 6-in. O.S. map, I would not hesitate to assert definitely that the mound described by Petrie never existed at all, and that his record of it is due to some freak of memory, or to some confusion in his notes, or in those of O'Donovan. The rough plan drawn by the latter, bound into the Ordnance Survey Letters, shows the mound, but the accompanying description gives no particulars regarding it. It has escaped notice that there is a mound incorporated with the north eastern corner of the outer rampart of the structure here called Tech Cormaic. The outermost fosse has been deflected so as to avoid interfering with it (see the plan, Plate VII). It seems as though this mound had existed before the building of Tech Cormaic, and it had been necessary to modify the plan of the latter earthwork in order to avoid interfering with it?doubtless, as Mr. Westropp remarked to me, because it was too sacred to be injured. There is some difficulty in reconciling the position of this mound with the directions given in PD; but unless this be Duma na Bo it is impossible to say what it might have been, and there is nothing elsewhere that can be identified with Duma na Bo. 11. Duma na n Giall The " Mound of the Hostages " was north-east of the site of the Forrad (PD 12), and its identification with a prominent mound roughly in that position,2 inside the rampart of Raith Rig, is certain. There can be little doubt that it is a burial tumulus, not the site of a dwelling, as Petrie supposed. It is not obvious why Duma na nGiall should be mentioned along with Brug Maic in Oc (New Grange) and Dun Cremthainn on Howth as the " Three Wonders of Ireland," in a quatrain in the Book of Leinster (facs., p. 164, upper margin). 12. Fdl ?k\, or Lia Fail, as U calls it (PD 13), was beside Duma na nGiall to the north. VD does not mention it ;3 but this is probably an oversight. The 1 Tara, p. 158. 2 H says north, which is more nearly correct. 3 Fal na Temrach (iii 82) is not a reference to the stone ; it simply means " the vailum of Temair."</page><page sequence="21">Macalister?Temair &amp;reg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 251 author of the poem apparently meant to describe it at length, for he mentions Duma na nGiall first of all the monuments of Temair* entirely out of its proper order, most likely because of its proximity to Fail. From many points oi view Fal was the most noteworthy of all the monuments of Temair. The historical and religious significance of Fal will be discussed later; at present we are concerned with its identification only. The late tradition connecting Fal with the Coronation Stone now in Westminster Abbey is not worth the expense of a drop of printers ink.1 Petrie's identification of Fal with the stone now erected over the " Croppies' grave," on the summit of the mound here called Tech Cormaic, derives much weight from its resemblance to other inauguration stones,3 and from the fact that till 1798 it actually lay beside Duma na nGiall, the place indicated by Dind-shenchas Erenn. Certainty is impossible, but the identification is not without a considerable measure of probability. The initials of the buried rebels, with the formula R.I.P.,3 are now carved on the stone; but archaeologically it has no more business on the mound where it now stands than has the unseemly statue of St. Patrick erected beside it in recent years. Petrie, who describes and figures this stone (Tara, p. 162), reports, evidently at second hand, an erroneous statement as to its dimensions. He says that it stands 6 feet above ground, and that it is 12 feet in total length. In point of fact, it stands just under 5 feet high above ground ; and the late Dr. Cochrane, who saw it uncovered to its base, assured me that it is not more than 6 feet in total length. 13. Lecht Con ocus Ceihin Two stones, now disappeared, on the western slope, level with Raith Rig (isin leitir hi comardus Rdtha na Rig star, PD 14). VD associated the monument with Cnoc B6 (iii 89, 90). PD tells, in a not very intelligible abstract, the tale of how Cu killed Cethen, and was himself slain in revenge; 1 A curious version of the well-known old-wives' tale which makes the Westminster stone, the Scone stone, Lia Fail, and Jacob's pillar identical with one another is abstracted in Revue celtique, xxiii, 227, from Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia de Madrid, vol. xl. It is not easy to make out from this review whether the Spanish story is merely a confused rechauffe of the familiar material, or is genuinely an alternative version of the legend. But this question is here of very little consequence. Skene's brochure on the Coronation Stone (Edinburgh, 1869) still remains the best compilation of the literary material. 2 Such as that wrongly called the Stone of Dathi at Rathcroghan. Excavation has shown that the mound under this stone is merely an adapted esker, and contains no interment. 3 In spite of an imaginative article in Proceedings R.I.A., ix, 539, there is no trace of any ancient carving on the stone.</page><page sequence="22">252 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. an incident which formed the alleged basis of a proverb, domgniis Cu is Cethen, " you have played Cu and Cethen on me." The story is ascribed to the time of Cormac, of whom Cethen is said to have been the table-attendant (rondaire). 14. Loeg The "Calf" well, of which we have already spoken in connexion with Caprach Cormaic, was on the slope northward from the stone of Cethen, and was the source of a stream that flowed westward (PD 15). It exists, as a small and insignificant source of muddy water, in the place indicated by Petrie : a modern structure of stones, resembling a small sou terrain, roofs it in. It is not marked on the 25-inch Ordnance map; its place there would be a short distance south-east of the letter 0 in the townland-name fodeen, and in the same field. 15. Cuchtair Chormaic The site of Cormac's Kitchen was on the slope of the hill on the brink of, and eastward from, Loeg (PD 16, VD iii 132). There is now no trace of this structure; it may have been of wood and unfortified. 16. Raith na Se.nad Near Duma na nGiall, and northward from Fal (either the stone so called or " the vallum," i.e. Raith Rig : PD 17, VD iii 81). Correctly identified by Petrie with the ring-fort north of Raith Rig.1 It has been almost wholly devastated by the people who were searching for the Ark of the Covenant. It is characteristic of them that they were hunting for the treasures of their patron saint Tea in a place to the north of the great raith, though all the authorities agree in putting the grave of that lady to the south of it. The legendary king OUom Fodla is said to have built a structure called Mur nOlloman, for the accommodation of Feis Temrach, the institution of which is traditionally ascribed to him. This building, whatever it may have been, is not mentioned in Dindshenchas Erenn, though other historians seem to speak of it as though it were well known. It must have been a building, for Olloni Fodla is said to have died within it; and it is unnecessary to point out that the existence of such a tradition proves the existence of the structure to which it was attached, quite independently of the question whether OUom Fodla ever had a real existence or not. While it is unpro fitable to indulge unduly in speculations that cannot be verified, I may permit myself to note here that it has occurred to me that in Raith na Senad we are to see the building originally called Mur nOlloman. The name 1 Taraf p. 171.</page><page sequence="23">Macalister ? Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 253 Raith na Senad is obviously later than Christianity; and when Tech Midchuarta superseded the older building as the place of assembly, and when the raith before us became associated in tradition with the three {' Synods" said to have been held within it, the later name might con ceivably have completely ousted the earlier. If the raith had been an ancient assembly-place, it would be natural to choose it for the convention of the " Synods." Had the Anglo-Israelites even done so much as to record what they actually did find, we might have partly forgiven them. But they did not even make this small compensation for their offence against science and against reason. Mr. Westropp tells me that after many inquiries he could not learn more than that a heap of bones, supposed to be a skeleton, was found, having the skull underneath; and some Roman coins, supposed to have been inserted by some practical joker. There was also a rock-cut ditch, not, apparently, coincident with the fosse of the rampart.1 Without seeing this it would be impossible to come to any conclusion about it; it might be nothing more than a natural flaw in the surface of the underlying rock. But if it be really an artificial feature, it is very important, and would to some extent corroborate the theory put forward above?showing that some ancient structure had existed on this site, and that the earthworks represented a later restoration or alteration. If ever an attempt should be made to repair the injury done to Raith na Senad?as I have been informed is in contemplation?it may be hoped that the opportunity will be taken to determine the real nature of this rock-cutting. A mound or tumulus is incorporated with the ramparts of this raith on the western side; just as a similar mound is incorporated with Tech Cormaic. Petrie records a popular name for this, current in his time, " the King's Chair." 17. Pupall Adamnain The site of Adamnan's Pavilion was inside Raith na Senad (PD 18). Petrie identified it with the mound popularly called the "King's Chair'V and it is quite possible that this is what the writer of Dind-shenchas Erenn intended. It is most probable that the real Pupall Adamnain was merely a building of a temporary nature, which would scarcely have survived to our time. PD speaks merely of the site (lathrach) of the Pavilion, which suggests that no actual building was extant when the author wrote. Adamnan's presidency 1 See Journal, Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, xxx, 176; xxxv, 404. The coins are there said to have been of Constantine the Great, 3 Tara, p. 175.</page><page sequence="24">254 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. at , the third of the synods which gave Raith na Senad its name was an event of considerable historical importance; still, it is hardly sufficient to account for the occurrence of a knot of sites just at this part of the ridge, permanently bearing his name. A possible reason for this curious fact will be given presently. 18. Cros Adamndin The Cross of Adamnan, so called, was at the entrance (arbeloib) of Raith na Senad, eastward [sair), according to PD 18. Just about the place indicated, though perhaps a little too far from the Raith to make the expression arbeloib strictly accurate, there is a rude pillar stone. It is of red sandstone, 5 feet 5 inches high above ground, 2 feet broad at base, and 10 inches thick; and it stands in the graveyard, not far from the modern church, to the south-west of it. A small figure, 1 foot 5 inches high, is carved in relief on its eastern face, 8^- inches above ground. The top of the stone is fractured; and Petrie not unnaturally took this stone to be the stump of Adamnan's Cross.1 Had the stone been a little further to the south, I should have preferred to identify it with Lecht Maine, another monument, which we have not yet mentioned. But probably it actually is the stone to which Dindshenchas Erenn refers under the name Cros Adamndin. This does not amount to an admission of the historic truth of the tradition that associated it with Adamnan, or even of the idea that it is the stump of a cross. On both statements I am inclined to throw considerable doubt. In the first place, there is a certain amount of improbability in the idea that Adamnan could have had anything to do with the erection of a massive stone cross on a site to which he seems to have paid a mere flying visit. In the second place, the nature of the sculpture on the eastern face is not such as we usually find associated with Irish crosses. In the third place, the stone was in the same condition as we see it now, in the tenth or eleventh century when VD iii was written; for that poem (line 83) speaks of it by the non-committal word Mac, "stone," and does not call it a cross. This would mean that the cross-head was then already destroyed. But such a destruction would involve no little violence, and would have been an act of sacrilege not likely at the time. I regard this stone, like the other stones of Temair now lost, as a pagan monument. It is conceivable that Adamnan consecrated it to Christianity by erecting a wooden cross on its top, as has been done in the case of the menhir of Dol.2 I can offer no objection to this way of saving the tradi tion : it would, indeed, account for the preservation of this particular stone. 1 Tara, p. 175. 2 See the illustration in Dechelette's Manuel d&gt; archeologie, i, 440.</page><page sequence="25">Macalister?Temair Br eg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 255 The sculpture carved in relief on the eastern face of the stone has been insufficiently examined by Petrie and his followers, and Petrie's drawing1 is a very inadequate representation of it. It is, in truth, of extraordinary interest. It represents a human figure with bowed legs crossed at the feet. There are enormous projections at the sides of the head, the nature of which, owing to the weathered condition of the monument, it is impossible clearly to make out. But they have every appearance of being a pair of horns. (See Plate VIII).2 A cross-legged, horned human figure can have but one meaning when found in a Celtic region. It must represent the important deity which on one of the famous Paris altars is named cernunnos. Cernunnos has all the barbaric characteristics of a very ancient, primitive deity. He seems, indeed, to be an animal god arrested while in the very process of " anthropomorphising." Several well-known representations of him exist on the Continent, which, though differing in minor details, agree in figuring the deity in a cross-legged, Buddha-like attitude, and in decking him out with one or more massive torques. On the head are horns, usually of a stag, but sometimes of a ram. The Temair relief agrees to some extent with the Continental sculptures in the attitude, and apparently in the horns. I could not feel so sure of the torque, owing to the weathered condition of the stone. It is difficult to guard oneself against tricks of imagination in an investigation of the kind; so I will only say, with the utmost caution, that it is not impossible that the figure actually has such a collar.3 It is not a little remarkable that the two torques which are now among the chief treasures of the Royal Irish Academy Museum were found somewhere in the neighbour hood of this stone.4 These gigantic ornaments, too large to be used by any human being except as a girdle,5 may well have been votive offerings to the 1 Tara, p. 176. 2 The figure, owing to its bad state, is a very difficult subject for the camera. The photograph reproduced on Plate VIII is not very satisfactory, but it is the best of several attempts. 3 After the above words had been written, I put the observations which they contain to the following test:?With Mr. Westropp I conducted to Temair a party of young friends who had never been there before, had no previous knowledge of the stone in question, and had never heard of Cernunnos or of his attributes. We asked them to describe, without any assistance or hints from us, what they saw in the sculpture. After remarking on the obvious features, eyes, mouth, &amp;c, one of them said u he has very large ears .... or are they horns? .... and he seems to have something round his neck." Mr. Armstrong has called my attention to a note in Wilde's Beauties of the Boyne and Blackwater (2nd Edn., 1850, p. 123), where the figure is described as having " something like horns upon the head." * Tara, p. 181. 5 Compare the girdle-torque worn by the figure of Nodens (Bathurst, Lydney Park, plate xiii). r.i.a. proc. vol. xxxiv, sect, c, [36]</page><page sequence="26">256 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. ancient Celtic god of wealth. Possibly they decorated a colossal wooden effigy of the deity. If this identification be admitted, some important consequences will result. In the first place, the stone will assume the great interest of being the only sculptured representation of a deity surviving from pagan times in Ireland. In the second place, it will cast some doubt on the theory that there was a Druidie prohibition of images, for which M. Salomon Reinaeh has argued with all his wealth of learning and persuasiveness,1 and may perhaps rehabilitate Lucan's evidence for the use of wooden images among the pagan Celts, upon which much doubt has been thrown. In the third place, it is possible, that it may show in what direction to look for" the origin of those strange figures, called by the silly name Sheelah-na-gig, i.e., Site na gcioch, " Sheila of the Breasts." Though these are female, and have had an element of obscenity imported into them, the squatting form of Cernunnos is the basis on which they have been designed. A glance at such an example as that at White Island, Co. Sligo,2 will make this clear. These figures thus seem to be survivals into Christianity of a perverted representation of one of the most important gods of Celtic pagandom.3 If this was a sacred stone erected beside some sanctuary of Cernunnos? and it may be no mere accident that a Christian church now stands on the spot?additional point would then be gained for the tradition reported in PD 20 and VD iii 81, that close by this monument was the house that was burnt over the head of Benen (Beniat in VD), St. Patrick's follower, and the druid Lucetmoel.4 As the house was built of wood specially for the experi ment, if we may trust our authority, it is useless to look for its remains; PD tells us that it was "ashort distance south-east of Adamnan's Cross, a little east of the path." It is very likely that the house would be built somewhere near the sanctuary of the deity under whose protection the druids of king Loeguire hoped to confute the preacher of strange doctrines. South of the Cross were the Seat and Mound of Adamndn [snide Adamndin 7 a Duma, PD 18). These have been effectually obliterated by generations of grave-digging.5 But again we ask, why were they called after Adamnan ? 1 Cultes, Mythes, et Beligions, i, 14*6, et seqq. 2 Figured in Journal, Roy. Hist, and Arch. Assocn. of Ireland, ser. iv, vol. v, p. 283. 3 The name of the giant Cormoran, killed by Jack the Giant-killer, is perhaps a cor ruption of Cernunnos, as the three-headed giant who enters into the same nursery tale appears to be a reminiscence of the tricephalous god of whom several figures exist. * See Tara, p. 176, where the story is given in full from Muirchu. * A conspicuous earthen mound running round the graveyard just inside the enclosing wall looks at first sight like another earthwork of the Temair series. But I cannot regard it as anything more than an old boundary of the cemetery. It is rectangular, and follows exactly the line of the ater tone wall that runs outside it.</page><page sequence="27">Macalister?Temair Rreg: Remains and. Traditions of Tara. 25? Especially, what was he doing at Temair with a duma? Once more we seem to detect evidence of evasion ; a re-dedication (to the Christian saint connected with an event taking place at this part of the hill) of features previously associated with the name of some pagan deity. If, as I have suggested, the so-called Cross of Adamnan was really a sacred stone originally dedicated to Cernunnos (by whatever name Cernunnos may have been called in Ireland), the "seat "and the "mound "may very well have been dedicated to the same deity. But why should they be called after Adamnan rather than Patrick, or Ruadan, who also presided at synods held in the same r&amp;ith ? Is it because of the homuncuhis sculptured on the standing stone ?l It should be noticed in passing that O'Donovan identified this stone with Lia Fciil,2 and records a local tradition that it marked the grave of Cormac macAirt. He does not forget to add the obvious comment that Cormac was buried at Ros na Righ. 19. Lecht Maine meid Munremuir Lecht Maine meic Munremuir fri Raith na Rig anoir?" the grave of M. son of M. is towards R.R. eastward "?says PD 19 in all the mss. except L, which omits the passage. I cannot find any story connecting Maine son of Munremar with Temair. But the name occurs in that very curious list, Tochostul Ulad, the persons to whom in Tain Bo Cualnge the message of the Ultonians was sent.3 This catalogue is much manipulated, and, as such lists are apt to be, is corrupt. But a very brief glance is enough to show that primarily and fundamentally it is a list of gods. Lug, Mor-rigu, Oengus Fer Bolg, Ogma Grian-ainech, Tailtiu, Macha, are the most obvious of these. Diabul Ard and Tarothor (" Lofty Demon " and " Monster ") have all the appearance of being Christian evasions for the names of unmentionable deities; and there are other names in the list whose essential divinity is at least probable. The names of heroes and of places have been interpolated, at a time when the true meaning of the list had become forgotten, or when it was considered desirable to obscure it; but to extricate the various elements would need a very lpng and detailed study, which would here be out of place. The appearance in the list of the name of Maine mac Munremair4 suggests that this is also a divine name; and coupling this monument with the stone of Mata, the stone of Fal. and the stone of Cernunnos, which we have already seen, we conclude that Lecht Maine was not a man's grave, but a sanctuary, with a sacred stone planted upon it. 1 See Cormac's Glossary, s. v. Adamnan. 2 O. S. Letters, Meafch, p. 223. 3 Tain, ed. Windisch, lines 4765 et seqq. 4 Bunni in L, Muindi in LLec. [86*]</page><page sequence="28">258 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. I have already said that I should prefer to identify the stone in the graveyard with Lecht Maine rather than with Cros Adamnain. " Treasures son of Fat-neck" would not be an inappropriate name for Cernunnos, god of wealth, with his thick torque; it might well have been the native name or (more likely) a nickname for that deity. The objection to the identification has already been hinted at: the graveyard stone is too far to the north, and could not be described as east of Raith Rig. But why does the compiler of PD postpone all mention of Lecht Maine until he has, as it were, passed the latitude of Raith Rig ? He usually follows a regular order, from south to north; and Lecht Maine ought to have been described along with Caprach Cormaic if it were really in the place indicated. Can it fee that Raith Rig is here a lapsus calami for Raith na Senad ? 20. Moel, Blocc, ocus Bluicne In a sentence preserved only in L, among the Dublin mss., PD 21 describes Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne as " three small stones beside Raith na Senad to the north " (teora clocha becca i tdeb Rdtha na Senad tiiaid). They stood in a triangle, M6el to the east, Blocc to the south, and Bluicne to the north, or, according to L, to the north-east. U calls Blocc " Bole." These stones are inferior in importance to Fal only, as I hope to show later. In the present topographical study we need only note that they have disappeared. The insignificant stones pointed out by Petrie,1 of which I can find only one,2 cannot be the monuments in question. They are in the wrong place, and will not fit in with what we are told of the stones and their functions. Perhaps the remaining stone, which is small and rounded, may be the origin of the tradition recorded in Lebor na hUidri of the fate of the druid there named Loeguire.3 This opponent of St. Patrick was buried in the earth at the word of the apostle, so that " all the dogs that come to Temair befoul his head." The present tense implies that the punishment of the druid was still i Tara, pp.179, 180. 2 In the graveyard : marked " stone " in the plan, Plate I. It stands near the so cialled Oros Adamnain, and is figured in Tara, p. 180. 3 See Bevue eeltique, vi, 164. The story is in some confusion ; in another version in Lebor Bwcc (printed in Tripartite Life of St. Patrick, vol. ii, p. 454) the name of the druid is given as Mantais. This is evidently merely an adaptation of the Greek fiaprts, but is not mueh less probable than Loeguire, which is clearly a confusion with the name of the king. Perhaps in some previous version of the story the words drui Loeguiri, '"' the druid of Loeguire," occurred, and a sleepy scribe misinterpreted them as " the druid Loeguire." According to the Lebor Brecc version the druid was swallowed up by the earth, giving rise to the proverb noconuil amain Mantais. Whatever this may mean, it is not difficult to see that the statement about the dogs has somehow been derived from it.</page><page sequence="29">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 259 in progress, and therefore that the " head" was still to be seen when the story was written down; this rounded boulder might easily be taken by imaginative persons as the head of a giant turned to stone and buried in the earth up to his neck.1 Another stone connected with the magical strife of Patrick and the druids of Temair was seen by Tirechan in the south-east of the raith.2 This has disappeared, or at least cannot be identified. 21. Lecht in Abaic Lecht in Abaic, the Dwarf's Grave, was east of Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne. All the mss. of PD 22 agree in saying that it was sairdes 7 siardes ("south east and south-west"). This is a little cryptical to begin with. We are further told that " three feet only is its measure, in its little slough below; thus is the grave, a small stone under the ground in its western end and another in its eastern " {tri troigthi namd a tomus 'na escaid bice tis ;3 is amlaid atd in lige, 7 cloch becc fo talmain ina iarthur 7 aroile ina oirther). This seems to indicate a cist of small size, sunk underground, which when PD was compiled had become full of mud. The cist was probably meant to receive a late bronze-age urn burial; its small size suggested to legend-framers that its occupant had been a dwarf, who is fitted with the name Sen ua Eibric in a poem quoted in Tara, p. 180. Next we learn that the cist possessed the peculiar property of measuring three feet when measured at one time, three and a half another time (fogdbtar tri traigid ind indara fecht, a tri co leith in fecht n-aile). Such tales are not infrequently told; thus we often hear that the members of a monument (e.g. a stone circle), when counted or measured on different occasions, give different results. So they do; it is not, however, a miracle, but the result of incompetence on the part of the experimenter. It must be noted carefully that the apparent marvel of Lecht in Abaic was on a different footing from the magical properties of Fal. The voice of Fal had long been silent when PD was compiled. The writer of the tract knew of it only from tradition, and spoke of it from second, or third, or fiftieth hand.4 But he had only to 1 Compare the partial burial of the companion stones of Cenn Cruaich, Tripartite Life, i, p. 92 : also the story of Mata and the warriors, supra, p. 241. Petrie records a tradition current in his time that the stones were " left there by the giants of Tara." 2 Tripartite Life, vol. ii, p. 307. 3 This is the reading of B, R. Variants are?tomus, esc bee this (L) ; a tomos indalige na esecaid (H) ; an a fad instead of a tomus (U). 4 The traditions of the properties of Lia Fail are fairly consistent; but that they were not exempt from the tendency to exaggeration to which all orally transmitted statements are liable, is shown by the list of its wonderful properties at the end of the existing fragment of Acallam na Senorach.</page><page sequence="30">260 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. walk across the hill of Temair?for, as we have seen, he was already on the spot?to test the properties of Lecht in Abaic to his heart's content. The clue to the marvel lies in the words sairdes 7 siardes. Two stones arranged as in the diagram here subjoined might be described loosely as "lying south-east and south-west" by a man standing at the point where if produced they would meet. And if A to C measures 3 feet and B to D measures 3| feet, all the conditions are satisfied. Look back now at PD, and it will be seen that the properties of the tomb are recorded without any expression of surprise. The author does not regard it as a marvel at all; he merely states, clumsily enough but intelligibly, that the dimensions of the tomb are different on the different sides. M But very soon this piece of scientific observation, if we may dignify it by such a term, became misinterpreted, which is perhaps hardly to be wondered at. The miracle-mongers fastened upon it, understanding it to mean that the stones were in the habit of shifting their relative positions. Just like the infant of Craebh Laisse, whose meaningless babblings were first taken for an invocation of the divine name, and then exaggerated into marvellous oracles as the story passed from mouth to mouth, till they earned for the baby a place among the marvels of Ireland, so we find the dwarf's elastic tomb mentioned among the three wonders of Temair. The other two wonders were "a boy of seven who begat children," and the scream of the stone of Fal.1 The first of these may be explained either (a) as a piece of folk-lore, reminiscent of some god who, like the infant Zeus, grew rapidly to his full strength; or (b) as an exaggerated report of an actual event?a case of a disease, happily extremely rare : a precocious maturity,2 called, I understand, progeria. The tale of the dwarf's grave, as told among the wonders of Temair, is to the effect that anyone, small or great, would find that it measured exactly five of his feet. Other versions and parallels 1 The Irish Nennius (Irish Arch. Soc), pp. 198-201. 2 Compare the well-attested case of Thomas Hall (aliter Hale) of Willingham, Cambridgeshire, who died in 1747 at the age of five years and eleven months, but with all the signs of maturity, and even of senility (see Phil. Trans. Royal Society, 1745. first quarter, p. 249 ; Edmund Carter's History of Cambridgeshire, reprint of 1819, p. 310 ff.). If we may believe these reports, something actually happened in the case of this abortion similar to the wild extravagance at the opening of the tale of Manus Og (Campbell's Waifs and Strays, ii, p. 338).</page><page sequence="31">Macalistkr?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 261 are given in Tara, p. 180, and need not here be repeated1; but we must not omit to mention the entirely different story told in Acallam na Senorach (ed. Stokes, line 7978 ff.), to the effect that the dwarf was the property of Conn Cet-chathach, and equal in height to thrice his master's fist: the best chess- and checker-player in Ireland, the best leech, and the best peace maker. The stone was his bed, and the largest man and the smallest infant who lay thereon would find just sufficient room for himself ? a sort of converse of the bed of Procrustes! All the men of Ireland, we $re told in line 7979, used to resort thither for the experiment. The Triads (Todd Lect. xiii,p. 14) mention the dwarf's grave as one of the three wonders, not merely of Temair, but of all Ireland. It is probable that the development of the tale along the lines indicated was helped by the peculiar properties, of which we have still to speak, ascribed to the stones Blocc and Bluicne. 22. Doll ocus Dorcha "Blind'* and "Dark," it appears, were two beggars who fought over the division of the alms which they had collected, and killed each other; the dwarf of the previous monument rashly endeavoured to separate them, and was trampled to death by the combatants. The beggars were commemorated by two mounds north of the dwarf's grave, which still remain where Petrie records them, though in a much abraded condition, Dall was south and Dorcha north.2 It is surely obvious that this trivial story is merely a floating bit of folk* lore that has somehow become attached to these monuments. It is unlikely that two beggars would have been buried under special tumuli on the summit of the sacred ridge of Temair. The story of the blind beggars who trampled to death one who tried to separate them is a rough rustic jeu d9 esprit?a folk-tale of the kind technically called a "droll," Dall and Dorcha are names such as might have been given to blind seers: compare Dalian, the name of the druid of king Eochu Airem. The essential point in the description (PD 23) comes at the end of the paragraph. After mentioning the graves, their names, their positions relative to Lecht in Abaic and to each other, and, after hinting at the story (more 1 To them should be added the Tomb of Amir, described by Nennius at the end of his list of the wonders of Britain. This had the properties ascribed to Lecht in Aoaic in an even more remarkable degree. 3 Adopting the reading of H. The-other mss. have "west." B has a peculiar reading which makes Dorcha west and Dall east. The relative positions of these mounds, Lecht in abaic, M6el and its companions, and Raith na Senad, are difficult to reconstruct: the plan shows the best I can make of the indications in the Dind-shenchqs,</page><page sequence="32">262 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. fully reported in VD), the prose text adds: 7 ni fuil mur eturru 7 na clocha 7 in cubat, "and there is no rampart between them, and the stones [i.e., Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne], and the grave [of the dwarf]." This must mean that a radical connexion was recognized as existing between the three groups of monuments; otherwise there would be no point in making the statement. For the nature of the connexion we have no data on which to base a con jecture. The mounds of Dall and Dorcha are not marked on the 25-inch map. 23. Mur na tri cogur We can say no more of the "Rampart of the Three Conspiracies " than that its history, its site, and the reason for its peculiar name are alike unknown. It was near (or around) Tech Midchuarta, and between that structure and Laech-thopur (PD 24; VD iii 78). Laech-thopur, the " Warrior-well," is not elsewhere mentioned, and its site is also unknown.1 I have not ventured on any conjecture as to either Mur na tri cogur or Laech-thopur on the plan. 24. Lia na Fian The " stone of the warriors," like Cros Adamnain, was at the entrance of (arbeloib), or opposite (ar inchaib), Raith na Senad (PD 25; VD iii 80). It must therefore have been somewhere near Cros Adamnain; but there is now no trace of it, nor is anything recorded of its history. 25. Tech Midchuarta This structure, also called for some unknown reason2 Long na mBan, " the ship of the women," is certainly to be identified with the two long parallel mounds at the north end of the ridge. It is an exercise of interest, and not without scientific value, to endeavour to restore in imagination the different buildings of Temair as they appeared when they were in full " working order." Such a study, however, must be to a large degree conjectural, for the materials on which it has to be based are extremely imperfect. But for Tech Midchuarta the materials are fuller and more promising than for any of the other buildings. We possess two 1 It may be merely another name for the Caprach well: it recalls its alternative appellation, Liaig na Fian. But this possibility is too slender to bear the weight of any theory of identification. 2 The reason is probably not unconnected with the incorporation of the (burial)-mound of the women in the eastern wall of the structure. For the meaning of the more usual name, Tech Midchuarta, see The Martyrology of Oengus, Henry Bradshaw Edn., preface, p. xii.</page><page sequence="33">Macalister?Temair Br eg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 263 versions of a remarkable ground-plan of this structure : the short tract Suidiugud Taigi Midchuarta: and some scattered references in Irish literature, all of which supplement the evidence afforded by the actual remains. The two ancient plans will be found in the Book of Leinster (p. 29 of the facsimile), and in the Yellow Book of Lecan (facsimile, p. 418). These have been reproduced with sufficient, but not absolute, accuracy, in Tara \l as they are thus easily accessible, if is unnecessary to repeat them here. The Lecan plan is the fuller, and is much the more carefully drawn; the Leinster plan is careless, and though older in date is on the whole less likely to be accurate. Both plans show a rectangular building: no attempt is made to preserve the proportions of the actual structure, which is drawn as though nearly square. It is divided into five aisles, and the single entrance door is shown at the lower end of the central aisle. The two outer aisles are divided into a succession of what I may call "pews," each of them set apart for the use of members of the different trades, professions, or ranks of society. The names of these, with the joints of meat to which their representatives were entitled at the feasts, are written in each of the divisions. The pews are carefully marked off from each other in the Lecan plan, but not in the Leinster plan; and the scribe of the latter ms. has been careless in the spacing of his words, so that he has had to carry the two lower pews in the outer side aisles into the inner side aisles. The effect of this has been to displace the doorkeepers from their proper place beside the door; one of the obvious faults which prejudice the student against the plan in the older ms. The inner side aisles are similarly divided. The Lecan plan shows a com partment at each side of the door, that on the left for the doorkeepers, that on the right for the buffoons. Then there comes a space where width is obtained by the omission of two pews on each side, making a Common Hall [erldr cdich). The Leinster plan omits this very probable feature. Inwards from the Common Hall the Lecan plan shows a succession of eight pews on each side, similar to those in the outer aisles, and similarly assigned, after which there is another open space, likewise obtained by omitting the last pew on each side. This open space is apportioned to the table attendants and the stewards; and as it would evidently be an advantage for these officers that they should be in an open space, for the convenient performance of their duties, we once more accept the Lecan plan, which shows this arrangement, rather than the Leinster plan, which merely writes a catalogue of trades, &amp;c, 1 In these reproductions the lines of the plan are drawn correctly after the model of the mss., though with a mechanical rigidity. The conventional "print" lettering has been substituted for any attempt to reproduce the handwriting of the mss. ?,I,A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV., SECT. C. [37]</page><page sequence="34">264 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. with their corresponding joints, in the columns representing the inner side aisles without troubling to indicate the subordinate divisions. The middle aisle is not encumbered with pews, and was evidently the thoroughfare through which the pews in the inner side aisles were reached. As there seems to have been no right-of-way provided from the central passage to the pews in the outer aisles, these must have been entered by external doors in the sides of the hall. The MS. plans omit these doors, but they are mentioned in the Dindshenchas description. PD says " there are twelve or fourteen doors in it, namely, seven east and seven west." If we take the smaller number of these alternatives, twelve?six on each side?we get one door for every pair of pews in the outer aisle, which is the most likely arrangement. There are a number of gaps in the mounds which now represent Tech Midchuarta, and these were taken by Petrie as being the remains of the side doorways. At p. 186 of Tara he makes the naive comment, " It may be re marked, as a curious proof of the accuracy of the prose description, that the uncertainty as to the number of doors being twelve or fourteen remains a difficulty at the present time." It cannot, however, be sustained that these gaps represent the original doorways. The remains have been mutilated by gravel-diggers and by agriculturists seeking top-dressing, and some at least of the gaps appear to be comparatively modern. In any case the number of doors mentioned by the Dindshenchas account is wrong ; for as there was a door at the end as well as at the sides (teste the ancient plan), there must have been an odd number of doorways in the original structure. The Dindshenchas writer does not aim at meticulous accuracy; he merely says " there were twelve or fourteen doors in it" as a eareless approximation, such as any of us may throw out in conversation at any hour of the day; and we cannot assume, as Petrie tacitly does, that the remains were in the same ruinous state when he wrote as they now are. A more serious difficulty is raised by the presence of the doorkeepers at the end doorway. These would seem futile if there were six unprotected doors in each side of the building. But according to VD iv 37, 38, the whole hall was surrounded by nine ramparts; these are perhaps to be equated to Mur na tri cogur. Even if this unheard-of number of fences is an exaggeration, there very likely was some sort of thicket fence surrounding the whole hall; there is no existing trace of such a fortification, so that we cannot think of earthen mounds. Unauthorized intruders would be stopped at the doorway of this outer \protection, so that the porters1 would be needed in the house itself only to guard the Common Hall from disturbance. 1 What was "Mol, doorkeeper of Temair," of whom we read in Cormac's Glossary (s. v. Milgitan) ? From the way in which the word is there used it would appear to be rather a technical term for the office than the proper name of some person who held it.</page><page sequence="35">Maca lister?Temair Br eg ; Remains and Traditions oj Tara* 265 The Leinster plan shows in the central aisle of the building the following, in order from the end door inwards: a locket, which may be either a light or a fire,1 more probably the former; a les or haunch, which a daul (waiter) is carving?the childish sketch of the waiter is not without interest for the study of costume ; a bir bruinnes or cooking-spit of Gargantuan dimensions, a lassar or fire, and at the inner end the dabach (cauldron), beside which are the dailemain or stewards. The Lecan plan is, as usual, more business-like. It shows in order from the door inwards a locum (lantern), cainnel (candelabra), dabach (cauldron), and three hearths, marked tene, one after the other. Behind the third hearth is the open space for the table attendants. We may here recall Keating's interesting account of the banqueting halls.2 He describes them as being long and narrow, with tables along the side walls, and hooks on the walls above the tables. A marshal (bollsaire) took the shields of those who were to partake of the feast, and under the direction of what we may call a recorder (sencha) he hung each on the hook above the owner's proper place. The feasters were then admitted, and each found his own seat, marked with his shield. If it be objected that this smacks too much of mediaeval chivalry, with its heraldic shields, we may fairly call to mind the Gaulish shields wrought with distinctive figures of animals (Diodorus Siculus, v, 30), comparing the famous Witham shield now in the British Museum, which has had the figure of a boar riveted on to it. Keating's statement may well rest upon ancient authority. It now becomes our task to fit this plan to the actual remains on the ground. For this purpose it has to be re-drawn in proper proportion. The result will be seen on Plate IX. For reasons that have now been sufficiently set forth, the Lecan plan is adopted as the basis of the drawing. The names of the several professions are placed in the pews belonging to them in English ; for the Irish names and for the joints belonging to them, reference may be made to Tara, p. 205 et seqq. On looking at this plan, the first thing that strikes us is the position of the king's pew. We might have expected it to be in some more conspicuous place?say at the very head of the hall, or in the exact middle. It occurred to me that this offered a very good test of the trustworthiness of the plan. If the fourth pew was suitable for the king, there ought to be some traceable reason for this suitability. Accordingly, I took an opportunity of visiting Temair to examine this question on the spot. The first point to settle was the orientation of the plan. The modern convention of placing the north at the top of the plan or a map did not bind mediaeval cartographers. It would 1 Loichet .i. cainnell no suirall no lasair?O'Davoren. 3 History, I. T.

[37*]</page><page sequence="36">266 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. be more likely that the bottom of the ancient plan (where the door is shown) would represent the north end of the hall, which, owing to the fall of the ground, is much lower than the south end. Moreover, all or most of the old roads appear to enter Temair from the north end, so that it is more probable that the doorway of the hall would be placed to the north, so as to be convenient to visitors. Otherwise when entering the hall they would have had to intrude unduly on the royal dwellings. This being assumed, it follows that the king held the fourth pew from the south end, on the western side. We must make the further assumption, which is quite reasonable, that the pews were of approximately the same size. The king's pew must, therefore, lie between three-twelfths and four-twelfths of the whole length of the hall from the southern end. It was with no small satisfaction that 1 found, on determining the place by measurement, that the site thus indicated stands exactly on the edge of a sudden fall in the ground, which makes the whole of the upper part of the hall to the end of the first four pews on each side a sort of natural dais. From this part of the structure the king would be able to command the whole hall in a way impossible at any other spot. The photograph, Plate X, fig. 1, shows the ridge. A person (indicated by the arrow) is sitting in the spot where the king's seat was placed. We can only conjecture how the pews were divided from one another; I suppose by dwarf wooden screens, probably carved with La Tene ornament, and enriched with metal-work. The plan being thus fixed, we proceed to consider the design of the super structure. The early stone churches of Ireland, which are modelled on the better-class timber-built houses of their time, enable us to form a general idea of the manner of construction of the latter buildings. We can picture to ourselves (1) four massive upright corner-posts, represented by the corner antae of the churches, supporting (2) a truss-(probably a king-post truss) at each gable-end, and (3) a heavy horizontal beam or wall-plate running along the tops of the side walls. The ends of these beams are translated, so to speak, into stone, in the projecting corner-brackets such as are found in some of the early churches of Glendaloch1 and elsewhere. The principals of the end trusses cross at the top, giving rise to the winged finials of the churches; and in the Y-angle of the cross rests the ridge-piece. The vertical walls between the corner-posts consist of wattles covered with baked earth. In a building of such exceptional length as Tech Midchuarta?it was about twice the length, and half the width, of St Patrick's Cathedral, the largest church 1 See my book, Muiredach, Abbot of Monasterboice, pp. 25-29, where these analogies are worked out in detail.</page><page sequence="37">Macalister?Temair Br eg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 267 in Ireland?there must have been a number of intermediate roof-trusses. These I assume to have been at the place where the side doors were pierced in the wall; and pillars are suggested in the restoration, rising from the intersections of the pew-screens. The roof, as in all early Irish buildings, must have been high-pitched; and it was possible by running a floor across the building at the level of the top of the wall to make an upper storey. We find this upper storey, translated into stone, at St Columba's House, Kells, and at St Kevin's " Kitchen " in Glendaloch. No staircase was provided to give access to this loft; a ladder would be necessary. In applying these principles to Tech Midchuarta, we derive valuable help from the opening paragraphs of the tale called Fled Brier end. Bricriu Venom - tongue made a feast for the Ultonians, and built a house especially for their accommodation. This house, we are told, was designed after the model of Tech Midchuarta. The naive anachronism need not trouble us ; the writer has forgotten that constant tradition ascribed the building of Tech Mid chuarta to Cormac mac Airt, whose floruit is some three centuries later than the alleged date of the Ultonian braves. If we assume a date somewhere in the middle of the ninth century for the origin of Fled Brier end in its present form?it is doubtless founded on still older materials?even then we are brought back to a time when traditional knowledge as to the general appearance of Tech Midchuarta was still living and accurate. There was doubtless a great deal more known about Tech Midchuarta and its arrange ments in the ninth century than there w7as when the Leinster and the Lecan plans were copied into their respective manuscripts. If then a writer of the ninth century says that a certain building was built after the model of Tech Midchuarta, while we need not believe a word of the story he is telling unless we have a mind to do so, we may very fairly conclude that in the description of the building of his tale he is actually giving us some sort of description of Tech Midchuarta, as he pictured it in his imagination. Bricriu's house, like Tech Midchuarta, was divided into pews, separated with screens of bronze enriched with a garnishing of gold. At one end was the couch of King Conchobar, raised high above the floor of the house ; and level with the couch was a griandn or soller wrhich Bricriu made for himself, with windows through which he could watch the strife stirred up by his devices. For Bricriu knew that the Ultonians would not allow him to come in among them owing to his numerous objectionable qualities.1 From this description we derive the conception of a rectangular building (not necessarily of the same proportions as Tech Midchuarta) with a lofty royal couch at one 1 Ft,ed Bricrend (Irish Texts Society, vol. ii), ad init.</page><page sequence="38">268 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. end, and an upper storey at the other, not extending along the whole length of the Hall. Figure 2 shows, iu outline, the only design which will satisfy all the conditions of the story. The upper loft was the soller of Bricriu; it terminated in a party wall with windows or spy-holes, through which the ill-conditioned master of the house could gloat over the proceedings below. Between this party wall and the opposite end, where the couch [imda] of Conchobar stood, the roof was open. It may be objected to this restoration that the royal couch is inconveniently and impossibly high. The objection can be met by supposing that the author of Fled iiricrend pictured the ground as falling away in Bricriu's house, as it does in Tech Midehuarta. Two considerations indicate that the same design was followed in Tech Midehuarta as is here indicated for Tech Bricrend?a long hall, with the iiiuiiijiiii nil CRIANAN BftlCRENtJ I ! flPPFRri p? IMOtfl Fig. 2#?Vertical Section of the House of Bricriu. roof trusses open at one end and masked by an upper storey at the other. In the first place, the ground falls away considerably towards the north, so that there is a much greater height at the north than at the south?thus giving greater head-room for such an upper loft. In the second place, it will be noticed that the Lecan plan shows the three hearths all concentrated at the southern end. This would be inexplicable, except on the hypothesis that there was an upper storey at the northern end, which would prevent the escape of the smoke. In the restored elevation on Plate IX, I have inserted dormer windows, merely as a convenient indication of the probable extent of the upper storey, but without the intention of suggesting that this was actually the way in which the loft was lighted?a point on which we haye no information. The three chimney-openings show that there is no obstruc tion for the smoke at the southern end. To these arguments for an upper storey we may perhaps add the testimony of VD that there were bed chambers in Tech Midehuarta. The floor being wholly occupied with the arrangements for the feasts and the assemblies, we must suppose that the dormitories were elsewhere in the building.</page><page sequence="39">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 269 This northern upper storey further gives us the raison d'etre for the Common Hall. Some free space was needed for the foot of the ladder leading up to the loft. And a special doorkeeper would be needed here to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the upper storey, which would doubtless be reserved for people of importance. The poem VD iv is almost entirely devoted to this structure. For our present purpose it is rather disappointing. Most of it consists of rapturous eulogies of king Cormac, the founder of the Hall, and of enumerations of the various functionaries connected with it. The only facts about the construc tion of the Hall which we gather from the poem are (A) its length, 700 feet, which agrees tolerably with the actual measurement of the remains; (B) its height, 30 cubits (s4 coic cubat), which may or may not be accurate; as Mr. Gwynn points out on p. 71 of his notes, it is suspiciously like an echo of the corresponding measurements in Solomon's Temple. The word cubat alone is enough to inspire such doubts.1 (C) The nine ramparts, already referred to ; (D) its doors, here given as fourteen in number. It is curious that the plans mark the end door but ignore the side doors, while the descriptions enumerate the side doors but make no reference to the end door.2 The prose tract called Suidiugud Taigi Midchuarta? does not carry us much further. But it seems to explain a discrepancy that would otherwise be puzzling between the 700 feet, given as the length of the building in VD, and the 300 feet in PD. It seems that the greater length is attributed to Cormac mac Airt, the lesser to Loeguire mac Neill; as though Loeguire had for some reason cut short the enormous length of the original hall. We have already (p. 241) noticed a passage which seems to imply that the hall had fallen into ruin in 1 .oeguire's time, though it suggests that the king provided a different substitute. The rest of the tract is occupied with lists of furniture, beds, &amp;c, in the house, which give us no help in studying its internal arrangements. 26. Duma na mBan-amus The " Mound of the She-mercenaries," otherwise Duma na mBan, the " Mound of the Women " (VD iii 61), was of small size, and in the south east,4 at the southern end of Tech Midchuarta (PD 27). This is probably to be identified with a small mound, close to the eastern wall of that building, Other parallels between the descriptions of the two buildings have not escaped Mr. Gwynn's notice ; reference may be made to his remarks, loc. cit. The evidence of the early churches tends to show that the narrow end of a rect angular building was the normal place for a door. 3 See Tara, p. 197. 4 Stokes by a slip translates " south-west." All the mss. read anairdess.</page><page sequence="40">270 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. and 31 feet from its southern end. The diameter of the mound at the base is 60 feet. Petrie placed Duma na mBan-amus on his map in the same position by conjecture; but, strange to say, he was unable to find any trace of the monument on the site.1 It is, however, fairly conspicuous. Unless the "women" were those slaughtered by Dunlaing, king of Laighen, in or about 222 a.d., we have no information as to the history of this mound. VD refers obscurely to the " betrayal" of the women after whom the mound is named, but gives no particulars. 27. Cdmfot Caelchon ocus a Arad The grave {lit. " equal length ") of Caelchu and his " ladder " were -" level with the northern end of Tech Midehuarta" (PD 28).. The grave was; apparently a earn; it is said in VD iii 143 to befo chochma cloch, an obscure expression (see Gwynn's note, ad loc.)? These monuments have disappeared; Petrie's identification of the " Fort of Caelchu" is wrong, the structure which he thus names being certainly Raith Grainde. Indeed, it is most probable that there never was a fort so named at Temair at all. Arad means " a ladder." H reads a' rait[h] instead of arad, on which the other MSS. are agreed: and, as usual, the lectio difficilior is to be preferred. The " ladder of Caelchu " might have been some structure of stones?an allee couverte, for example?standing close beside the earn, and#wrongly supposed to belong to it. Mr. Westropp calls my attention to the "steps" at Duntrileague, Co. Limerick?an allee couverte in which the successive capstones rise stair wise.3 There is a large block of conglomerate in the fence on the eastern side of the road not far from the indicated spot: this may possibly be a relic of the monument. 28. Treduma Neisi This was at and level with the north-east end (sic) of Tech Midehuarta (PD 29). The word treduma might mean either a triple ring-fort, or a group of three burial mounds; the latter seems the more likely, but VD iii 47 describes the structure as a raith.* Petrie found no trace of it; but Mr. Westropp and I noticed what may be the remains of it in a corner of a field close to the northern end of Tech Midehuarta, and on the opposite side of the neighbouring road. We observed a quadrant of a circle, the sides measuring 51 yards along the road fence and 63 yards along the adjoining field fence, 1 Tara, p. 215. 2 Gochma means some kind of vessel; possibly a comparison is intended between a heap of stones and a cooking-vat or some such utensil, turned upside-down. 3 See the drawing in Borlase, Dolmens of Ireland, i, 50. 4 Compare also the notice of Dinn Tradiii, s.v. Mug-eime, in Cormac's Glossary,</page><page sequence="41">Macalister?Temair Breg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 271 enclosing one small mound, much abraded. The rest of the structure has been destroyed by tillage in the adjoining field, and by the laying-out of the road; but a faint rise can be detected in the road, as well as its continuation into the field containing Tech Midchuarta, where there is a second small mound. 29. Edith Conchobuir This was beside and to the north of Treduma Neisi. It had a door facing the east, level with Corus Cind Chon-Chulaind (PD 30, VD iii 49). It was not found by Petrie, but seems to be represented by a deep gravel-pit in the next field but one to the north of that containing the remains mentioned in the last article. 30. Sciath Con-Chulaind The " Site of the Buckler of Cu-Chulaind " was level with the "Neck of Cu-Chulaind" {MMe Con-Cludaind), to the north-east. It evidently was an earthen ring, representing the outline of the shield, with a mound (tul) in the centre, suggesting the umbo. It is, in fact, described in exactly these terms in PD 31. It was more probably sepulchral rather than residential ?a grave-mound within an enclosure, like the dolmen at the Giant's Ring, near Belfast, or the cist at Longstone Fort, near Naas ; and, like these, was presumably a bronze-age monument, the " dedication" to Cu-Chulaind having been imposed upon it when its original owner was forgotten. No trace of this mound can now be discovered. 31. Corus Cind ocus MMe Chon-Chulaind The " Measure of the Head and Neck of Cu-Chulaind " is not mentioned in PD except as a guide to the identification of Raith Conchobuir and Sciath Con-Chulaind. It was to the north-east of the former, according to VD iii 50, and doubtless was near Sciath Con-Chulaind. In this collection of mounds, one called the head, the other the shield, of an ancient hero, we see an old example of the common idea of the " Giant's Grave," a name still current for megalithic monuments in the country. The names are at least as old as the story of the death of Cu-Chulaind, as it appears in the Book of Leinster, for the mounds are there alluded to in the following terms :?Otharlige a chind 7 a Idime ddi 7 Idn lainne a sceith di uir, " the sick-bed of his head and of his right hand, and the full of the cover of his shield of earth."1 As in the case of Sciath Con-Chulaind, we are probably to regard this as a bronze-age monument, re-named at a later time. It has now completely disappeared, probably owing to tillage. * LL, facsimile, p. 121 l&gt; 40. R.I.A. PKOC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C. [38]</page><page sequence="42">272 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The monument was probably a round tumulus with a neck-like projection attached to it. Mr. Westropp has sent me a sketch of a mound of similar design in the cemetery of Cenn Febrat. 32. Sescend Temrach " The little dirty marsh," which, with the partial exception of the springs, is the only natural feature of Temair mentioned in Dindshenchas J^renn, was level with Tech Midehuarta on the north-west. It was still remembered in Petrie's time, though it had even then been drained.1 It was south of Cam na Macciaide (PD 32) and east of R&amp;ith Granule (VD iii 45); Edith Neisi and Edith Conchobuir were east of it (VD iii 47). O'Donovan's account of the Sescend may here be quoted3: li This spot, extending from the*ash-tree under which there was a well called ToberFin [sic] southwards [sic; ? read " northwards "] to the road was spewy land in the memory of Mr. MacMahon, a farmer, who holds the adjacent land and who fought on the hill in '98 with all the vigor of his ancestor Colla Da Chrioch. Shortly before 1798 the proprietor of the land, to reclaim this 'spewy spot' stopped up Tober Fin with furze and rubbish ; and to carry off its fountain he sank a drain of remarkable depth for a short distance to the west of the well northwards to the road where the land n, [s/c]'^ The ash-tree and the well can still be seen, the latter marked by an irregular depression in the ground. 33. Raith Grdinde In the identification of Edith Grdinde and its companion Fothad Edtha Grdinde, Petrie had erred unaccountably. The ramparts which he calls by these names are certainly the Cloenlertai. Petrie's identification* leaves no room on the hill for the Cloenlertai, which were to the west of Edith Grdinde: and even the relative positions of the two structures are given erroneously, for Petrie makes the Fothad south of the Edith, whereas the authorities which we have to follow make it the northern of the two. Taking these two sites as the Cloeniertai, we must look for Edith Grdinde to the east of them; and we find it at once, in a shapely ring-fort which Petrie has called -Edith Caelchon. Even if there were evidence that such a structure as the fort of Caelchu existed at Temair at all?and, as we have seen, there is no such evidence?the fort called by that name in Petrie's work is too far from the site of Tech Midehuarta to accord with the indiea i Tara, p. 151, 2 0, S. Letters, Meath, p. 234. 3 Tara, p. 21Q.</page><page sequence="43">Macalister?Temair Br eg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 273 tions in PD, to the effect that "Comfot Caelchon is level with the northern end " of that building (PD 28). On the other hand, it appears tp agree in position with that assigned to Rdith Grainde?" westward from the Marsh of Temair on the summit of the mound" (6 Seiscend Temrach aniarforforard na telca). I suggest, therefore, that the structure hitherto called R&amp;ith Caelchon on Petrie's authority should be named R&amp;ith Grdinde. According to Trans. R.I.A. xxx, 279, the lump of red enamel mentioned above (p. 238) was found "on the inner slope of the northern portion of the ditch" surrounding this raith. This would tend to show that the raith was a little older than the time of Grainde, daughter of Cormac, but not much. It is right to mention that there is another story, to the effect that the object was found at Kilmessan (loc. cit.). But the localization in Raith Grainne seems very circumstantial. 34. Fothad Rdtha Grainde This structure was to fehe north, under Fdn na gCarbat, and level with the northern Cloenfert (PD 34). Neither it nor Raith Grainde is men tioned in VD. There is no separate structure now to be seen in the place indicated. But there is a small mound attached to the external rampart of the mound here called Udith Gr&amp;inde, on the north side; and this may be the structure intended. The question turns on the meaning to be assigned to the word Fothad. O'Donovan, in the O.S. Letters, confesses his inability to deal with it. Stokes, in his edition of the Rennes Dind-shenchas, translates it " founda tion," which is not altogether satisfactory, for it implies that the fort was in one place, and its foundation in another! The sense given to fothugad in O'Clery's Glossary?cumdach no tinnsgnamh?suggests the sense which we can best attach to this word: the "founding" or "beginning"; the "original" R&amp;ith Grainde ; the " building which developed into Raith Grainde "?such seems to be the meaning which we are to understand. It does not necessarily follow that this is what actually happened; all that we are to infer is that when Dind-shenchas Erenn was compiled, or rather when the name Fothad Rdtha Grainde became attached to the mound, it was supposed to have been the original raith. It looks more like a burial-mound: a,nd once again we see a case of the incorporation of such a mound with a r&amp;ith. This, however, is less likely to have happened in the case of a residential raith. 35. Cloenfertai The.Cloent'ertai were west of Raith Grainde; and both this indication, and the appropriateness of the name " sloping trenches ", help us to identify [38*]</page><page sequence="44">274 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. them with the pair of conspicuous ramparts on the steep north-western slope of the hill. Petrie seems to have supposed that they were merely a sort of wall or ditch, running down the hillside; but the fact that historical or quasi-historical events are said to have taken place within them?the slaughter of the princesses by Dunlaing in the southern Cloenfert, ana the gu-bretha or wrong judgments of the usurping king Lugaid in the northern? is enough to show that they were bitildings of some kind. Indeed, the state ment luid jo Jn all leth don tig irrucad in ghiibreith1 " half the house where the wrong judgment was given slipped down the slope ", grotesque though it be, gives an accurate idea of the curious site of this structure; half of it being on the flat top of the ridge, and half on the steep slope of its side.8 This is evidently the basis of the version of the story of the desertion of Temair told in the Norse Speculum Regale* The southern Cloenfert goes also by the name Fert na n-Ingen: see Hogan's Onomasticon, s.v. 36. Carnn Maccraide Laigen The stone-heap of the Leinster youths was beside and to the north of the Sescenn (PD 36). Like most of the stone monuments, and nearly all the structures at the north of the hill, it has disappeared. 37. Cros Fergusa Noeb-Ailithir The Cross of the Holy Pilgrim Fergus, of whom we would like to know more, was i Carraic daman hi taeb Cairnn na Maccraide "in Carraic Cluman beside Carnn na Maccraide" (PD 37). The cross has disappeared. The place-name Carraic Clumau (Cliini in L) does not appear elsewhere, nor is there any prominent rock anywhere about, so far as I can see, to which it would be likely to belong; and Carnn na Maccraide exists no longer. Petrie gives no reference for the " Irish tradition " that he reports,4 to the effect that " Fergus, the pilgrim of Carraic Clumain, saw in a vision that a cross would be erected in honour of himself near Fan na Carput, on the hill of Tara "; and I have failed to trace out his authority. 1 Silva Gadelica, i, 255 ; ii, 288. 2 See Mr. Westropp's photograph, reproduced in Plate X, fig. 2, where the sloping site is well shown. 3 Eriu, iv, 10. But Senchas M6r (Ancient Laws, i, 6), and Betha Colmdin (Todd Lect., xvii, p. 62) have a reference to a legend ascribing the "tilt" to the prayers of St Patrick, which caused an earthquake ; the original legend doubtless attached to the Cloenfert, as stated in Betha Colmdin (where the structure is called Glaenrdith Temrach). In Senchas Mor it is made to apply to the whole of Temair. 4 Tara, p. 144, note 9.</page><page sequence="45">Macalister?Temair Breg Remains and Traditions of Tara. 275 38. Deisel Temrach Deisel Temrach was situated between the two stone-heaps of the youths, that is, between the southern heap and the northern heap (PD 38). According to VD iii 137 it was between the two earns, and tes Crinnai? " south of Crinna "?a mere cheville. More important is the further state ment that it was fot co rath ria ndul ar eel a sditis daine deisel, "a sod with luck before dying, wrhere men used to turn sunwise". This passage obviously refers to some religious rite, probably observed before going into battle, in order to secure good fortune for the warriors. There can be little question that Deisel Temrach was a stone circle; and the passage, to which we must return later, is of importance in giving us some notion as to the traditional purpose and use of such monuments. The structure has now entirely disappeared. 39. Carnn Maccraide Ua Niill We know nothing about the stone-heap of the youths of Ui Neill, except that it was beside and to the north of Deisel Temrach (PD 38). There is no record of the history of the Leinster and the Ui Neill youths who owned the two earns named after them respectively. The two names occur together in the Annals of Ulster (a.d. 779), where we read of a "convention of the synods of the Ui N&amp;ll and the Leinstermen " which met in " opido " Temro under the presidency of Dublitter the anchorite. 40. Raith Colmdin meie Faelchon This fort was north-east of Carnn Maccraide Ua Neill (PD 40). The owner of the fort is called son of Faolchu iii R, of Aelchu in B, and of Caelchu in L, U, H. It may possibly be traced in some obscure irregularities in the ground, connected with a gravel-pit, in the southern corner of a large field next to the west of that containing the remains here identified with Raith Chonchobuir. 41. Duma ind Luchduinn This mound was west of R&amp;ith Colmain (PD 41). It is not mentioned in VD ; it can no longer be found; nor is anything known of its history. The word Luchdonn (spelt variously in MSS.) occurs twice in Fled Brier end as an epithet of the Ultonian hero Loeguire Buadach; but this does not help us much, except, indeed, on the theory already set forth, that the monuments at the north end of the ridge were the remains of a bronze-age burial-place, which in popular tradition had become transferred wholesale to the braves of</page><page sequence="46">276 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the Ultonian cycle, Conchobar, Cu-Chulaind, and the rest. Elsewhere the luck donn appears as a monstrous [wolf?]: see Todd Lectures, xiv, p. 28. There is a pile of stones in the north-east corner of the field containing the remains here called Edith Chonchobuir. This would about fit in with the place indicated for Duma ind Luchduinn. 42. Adlaic ocus Di-adlaic These were two springs on the side of the slope, level with Edith Colmdin on the north-east (hi comJtardus R.O. sairtuaid, A. hi toeb leitrech frisin raith anair-tuaid: PD 42). The directions are not very easily followed ; according to VD iii 135, two streams flowed from them down to Carnn na Maccraide; therefore they must have been on the slope above the Carn, that is, to the south of it. But according to PD 42 they were, north-east (sair-tuaid) from Edith Cholmain, and the latter was north-east from Carnn Maccraide Ua N&amp;I1, which was the more northerly of the two stone heaps. As we have alreadjr said, when PD and VD are thus irreconcilable, the former is to be preferred in topographical questions. But it is not very clear wKat PD means by saying, " They are two springs, Adlaic is one of thetn and Di-adlaic the other, but there is no difference between them" (di tipraid indsin, Adlaic indara n-6i 7 Pi-adlaic aroile, acht ni uil deochair eturra). Taken in connexion with the names, which appear to mean " desirable " and " non-desirable " respec tively, this perhaps implies that the two wells are really one, and that under certain mysterious circumstances it changed its character*?being on some occasions salutary, on others hurtful. Magic of this sort is familiar in folk lore : we may compare the well of Sliab nGain.1 Xo the east of the pile of stones mentioned above in the notice of Duma ind Luchduinn, is a deep cow pond. If this be a spring it may represent either or both of these water sources. 43. Lecc Mail ocus Midna The" stone commemorating the youths who were found playing hurley with the head of Cu-Chulaind, and were killed in punishment for the sacrilege, was somewhere near Corus Cind Chon-Chulaind (VD iii 53)&gt; but there is jiq indication of its position relative to that monument. I have therefore omitted it from the plan. Some other sites in or near Temair are mentioned in Acallam na Senorach and may be here enumerated, though no attempt at an identification of any of them can be made. These are Pert na nDruad, the Grave oi the Druids, 1 Metrical Uindshenchas (Todd Lect., vol. x), p. 436.</page><page sequence="47">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 277 north-west of Temair (361)l: Lecc na nDruad, the Stone of the Druids? perhaps the same place, though this is said to have been noYth-east of Temair (7957) *. Cnoc iw&gt; nonbur, " the hill of the nine men," which, whatever we may think of tbe story told of it (7901), was probably a burial tumulus3; it was west of Temair : aud Ard na Tened (1731), the height of the fire, which was probably the site of a sacred fire, notwithstanding the marvellous tale which the Acallam tells to account for the name. In Caithreim Conghail Cldiringhnigh* part of the scene is laid in Temair, and there are some topographical notes. The text is late, and the description anachronistic; but it ought to correspond generally with the Dind-shenchas topography. The curious statement is made (p. 10) that every pentarch had buildings and land at Temair. If this be so, it need not have been on the ridge itself, Tmt may have been in the surrounding plain. The expedition of Conghal came to Temair and arrived first at Raith Uladh, the Raith of the Ulidians, " which is now called Edith na nDoirseorach, the Raith of the Door keepers." There is no such raith recorded in the Dind-shenchas description, nor do I find it mentioned elsewhere; it is not entered in the Onomasticon. As the text goes on to say in effect that the travellers, coming from Ulaid to Temair, stopped first at this raith in order to prepare themselves, and to deposit their travelling equipment in their own houses, it was most likely some outpost not on the hill itself. On three sides there are such outposts; Raith Meidbe at the south end of the Ridge, Ringleston liditli by the side of the road from Kilmessan on the west, and Raith Miles, otherwise (according to the Ordnance Survey Letters) Raith Lugha on the north. The last-named may have been the doorkeepers' fort. At p. 20 of the same text we read that on the following morning the king rose before sunrise, as by one of the gessa attached to his office he was obliged to do,4 and went to perform his ablutions in Tidbruid na Laochraidhi, after which he came to Duma na Riograidhe beside Muillenn Chiamaidhe, " for it is there that kings were wOnt to sit." Muillenn Chiarnaidhe is, of course, the mill on the stream Nith. The only duma near this is the sid mound that was over Nemnach, and it may be that there was some religious duty which the king had to perform there in the early morning. Tiobruid na Laochraide is presumably the same as the unknown Laech 1 To be distinguished from Fert in Druad (7726), which was in Connacht. In line 5270 Fert na ndruad is said to be ar faithche na Temra?on the lawn of Temair; so that possibly the M6el, Blocc, and Bluicne group of monuments is intended.

The various sleeping-huts that are referred to in the text were probably temporary structures. At p. 24 we hear of Lios na Riograidhe, " 3iow called Lios Torna iZccis," where was the house of Cairbre Cromm, king of Breg and of Mide. A lios called after the chief poet Torna ficces was perhaps that otherwise called Mur nOllamhan. We have already suggested an identification of this structure with Edith na Senad, and this may well have been the raith used by Cairbre as a sleeping-place. 3.?The Ohigin of Temaiii Cuhi robo Temair Temair ? When did Temair become Temair ? This is the question which the poet of VD i invokes the legendary sages of Ireland to-answer; and it is the question which we must now consider. The material for the study that is now to occupy our attention is two fold : archaeological and literary. The archaeological evidence has been marshalled in the preceding section; the literary evidence consists of a number of very remarkable traditions. We begin with the archaeological material. It is impossible to date rude earthen mounds by inspection only The most expert archaeologist in the world could not classify the majority of the remains of Temair chronologically without assistance from some external source. Excavation, by revealing datable objects, might conceivably give a clue, but this is by no means certain. Indeed, so far as can be judged from observation on the surface, the prospects of a successful " dig " in the mounds of Temair are not very bright. Petrie found people cutting top-dressing from the mounds, and this process may have boen going on for more than a century before his time. Further, I am inclined to suspect that there was a certain amount of surreptitious digging after the discovery of the great golden torques, early in the last century. We have no information as to the state of the mounds before that time, as no survey earlier than Petrie's exists; and it is on some such hypothesis that the partial destruction or total disappearance of many of what might have been the most promising mounds for excavation can best be explained. In any case, excavation on a site of the outstanding importance which Temair possesses should not be carried out except with the most extreme caution; and the excavator would be in duty bound to expend as much money in restoring the mounds to the exact con dition in which he found them as in making the necessary trenches. It is to be hoped that we may never know what, if anything, lies buried beneath the surface at Temair, if the excavation is to be carried out after the model put before us in recent years at Edith na Senadf</page><page sequence="49">Macalisteb?Temair Breg; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 879 Moreover, it is not certain that even a successful excavation would illuminate the problem of origines Temoriae. Datable objects might tell us at what time a building containing them wasoccupied, but would not necessarily tell us anything as to when and for what purpose it was first built. In the absence of any archaeological clue to the dating of the different sites at Temair, we must fall back on the legends contained in Dind-shenchas JElrenn. When that book was compiled, these legends were by a thousand years fresher, and were by so much nearer to the events which they professed to record, than we are; and they belonged to a time when such legends were the chief mental pabulum of the people of the country. Thus, foolish though many of them admittedly are, they are all the more likely to contain some germs of real historical truth, though these may be thickly overlaid with the irresponsible imaginings of the generations of story-tellers'through whose mouths they had passed. And, fortunately for us, Dind-shenchas $renn is remarkably full in the information which it gives us about the legends of Temair. The first step of the investigation must be to classify the various sites according to the date assigned to them by the Dind-shenchas traditions. Taking the reign of Cormac macAirt as an era, we can draw up this classification as follows:? A; Later than Cormac macAirt?x Rdith Loeguiri meic Neill. Raith na Senad. Pupall, Cros, Suide, 7 Duma Adamnain. Cros Fergusa. Carnn Maccraide Ua Neill. Carnn Maccraide Laigen (probably). B. Contemporary with Cormac macAirt?'1 Tech Mairisend. Lecht Mata Mor-glondaig. 1 Except Cros Fergusa, which must be Christian, and Carnn Maccraide Ua N6U1, which must be later than the establishment of the sept of Niall, the late date assigned to the sites named in this list is perhaps open to question. As has already been shown (p. 242), the Mata story is inconsistent with a late date for Raith Loeguiri. Raith na Senad is named here simply because there is no earlier mention of it under that name. The sites connected with the name of Adamnan may be much earlier, as has been shown in the articles dealing with them in the previous section. 3 Of the sites in this list, the first, second, fifth, sixth (?) and twelfth are most likely of an origin earlier than Cormac; see the articles dealing with them in the preceding section. r.i,a. proc, vol, xxxiv, sect, c, [89]</page><page sequence="50">280 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Previous to his time the " High-kingship " had no real existence; politically the kings of Temair were merely the local chieftains of the province in which the Eidge is situated. That the standing army organized by Cormac, the memory of which survives in the traditions of the fiana of Finn, was an innovation modelled on the Boman legions, may be taken for granted. A man of energy and bold initiative, such as Cormac is consistently represented as being, had opportunities for studying the machinery of empire in the Eoman operations witnessed by his generation in Britain. Doubtless it was the example thus put before him that showed him the way to extend his pro vincial sovereignty over as much of the island of Ireland as he could manage to conquer. The traditions that assign so many important monuments to Cormac cannot be altogether baseless, though they may be doubted in some individual cases. Tech Midehuarta has all the appearance of having been modelled after the pattern of a Eoman basilica; and the traditions which make Cormac the master of a standing army, a patron of letters, an adminis trator of laws?even that strange story which credits him with some kind of Christianity?all fit in with the portrait of the man who planned his life and his actions on the models afforded him by Eoman Britain. There may be a considerable element of truth in the theory, which is at least as old as Pinkerton, that the fiana of Cormac were first organized to guard the coast from a possible Eoman invasion. Cormac, indeed, is the first real personality in Irish history. Doubtless some of his predecessors in the pages of the Annals had a real human existence. I see no reason to deny this to such people as Tuathal Techtmar, Conchobar inac Nessa, Cu-Chulaind, Medb, and many others; but these have become so completely wrapped up in a fog of legend that it is impossible to be Certain of the historical truth of any of the actions attributed to them; while Cormac, though the legend-makers have not altogether left him alone, stands out clearly before us as an innovator, a conqueror, and a law-giver. In the present essay we do not propose to dwell on the doings of Cormac and his successors. Our special purpose is the origin of Temair, and the nature and early history of its kingship. The later historical developments, inaugurated by the conquests of Cormac, do not specially concern us here, except in so far as they may throw some light on the problems before us. We therefore exclude from our consideration the buildings attributed to Cormae and his successors. The next step, then, will be to re-classify the older buildings, including a few that seem to be attributed in error to [39*]</page><page sequence="52">2fi&amp; PrmedmgB of the Royal Irish"Academy r Cormac's time, according to their purpose.;; This classification; \^illbe^ as Allows :-* A.1 Sanctuaries?

It is asa sanetuary, or rather as a group of sanctuaries, that it calls for attention; and, as we hope to show, its king was primarily a religious rather than a civil functionary. It is not for nothing that the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick calls Temair cend idlachia ocus druidechta na hEirenn1?^" head of the idolatry jand druidry of Ireland." A further classification may now be indicated, in which the different monuments are grouped by constructional types. It is scarcely necessary to set forth this classification at length; we may content ourselves with indicating the headings. Primarily we may divide the monuments of Temair into (i) stone and (ii) earthen structures. The former may be grouped as? (1) standing stones; (2) stone circles (round Tech Mairisend, and Deisel Temrach) (3) cists and dolmens (Lecht in Abaic and Arad Caelchon). The latter may be divided into (4) earthen rings; (5) earthen mounds * (6) earthen mounds ^cumuli) within rings. Of these, class (1) may belong to $ny pre-Christian date, and cannot be assigned, without external aid, to any definite period. The same is true of (4) and of (5). On the other hand, classes (2) and (3) are essentially bronze age monuments.2 The sanie is perhaps true, as a rule, of no. (6), if the analogies presented by the Giant's Eing and Longstone Fort hold good. But even if we have to assign certain ringed tumuli to the Iron Age,3 there is sufficient evidence in this classification of the monuments that the history of Temair begins in the Age of BrOnze. ' It is especially to be noted that the burial monuments are for the greater part at the north end of the ridge: and it is not improbable that this was due to the existence here of the stone circle called Deisel Temrach. Just as Stonehenge stands surrounded by the grave-mounds of those who desired to be buried near the sanctuary, so the " sward that brought lupk before dying " was regarded as a suitable centre for burial. The history of Temair, therefore, seems to begin, at least partly, as thfc history of a cemetery;1 but other elements, as we shall see, entered into its sanctity from the first. liven: Dindshenchas Erenn has not ignored 1 Ed. Stokes, vol. i, p/40.

The bronze* age, pre-Celtic heroes, after whom the mounds were originally named, have been displaced in tradition by the heroes of the dominant Celtic, or, more accurately, the Celtic-speaking people, after these had taken possession of the country and introduced the Iron-Age culture. The forgotten warriors of the Age of Bronze have yielded their place in popular legend to Cu-Chulaind, Conchobar, and their attendant braves. Such, in abstract, are the conclusions at which an archaeologist would arrive, who visited the site and examined it with the descriptive portions of the Dind-shenchas texts in his hand. But Dind-shenchas Erenn has something further to add about the early history of the site, in the shape of certain stories, contained in a preface to PD, and in the first two poems of VD. To these we have not yet referred, and we must now analyze them. The poem VD i calls on the ancient sages of Ireland to tell the history of the site, and then proceeds to reply to the invitation, in the name of Finntan, the antediluvian invader of the country, to whose survival through the centuries the preservation of ancient memories was naively attributed. We need hot, however, linger over the "machinery" of the composition, nor turn aside to discuss the Finntan myth, which would occupy an essay in itself. Stripping the poem of its verbiage, and of its metrical devices, we can reduce its contents to the following summary:? (1) The hill was originally a hazel-thicket, in the days of " the son of Ollc&amp;in."1 This thicket was cleared by Liath son of Laigne Lethan-glas, who turned it into a corn-land (a harbur ba harbur miith, u its corn was rich corn "). This Liath called the ridge after his own name, Druim IAith, that is "Lfath's Ridge." (2) The ridge afterwards passed into the ppssession of C&amp;in son of Fiachu Cendfind&amp;n, from whom it received its second name, Druim Cdin, "Coin's Ridge." It now became a military station {in tiilach a t&amp;igdis mdir, " the hill to which chief tains used to go ,"). (3) Crofind daughter of Allod then comes on the mene, and from her the site was called Cathair Chrolind, " C.'s fortress," in the days of the Tuatha D6 Dananrf. A palace has therefore now been built on the ridge. (4) Crofind was succeeded by Tea daughter of Lugaid, the wife of Eremon, who built a rampart round her house, outside which she was buried; and from her the site was called Tea Mur. 1 The nominative of this name is probably 011c[h]4in, not Oilcanj compare Cam in the following stanza.</page><page sequence="55">Mac a listen?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 285 The purpose of the poet is not so much to give a history of the site, as to account for a series of names by which, according to tradition, it was successively known: Fordruim (apparently the original name before the clearance of the hazel-thicket), Druim Leith, Druim Cdin, Cathair Chrofind, and Tea Mur (sic). The course of events by which he endeavours to account for these names is clearly very natural; unusually so, indeed, for a Dindshenchas history! The change of the name of a place with its owner is a common occurrence in Ireland down to modern times; Flanagan's Eock, Fort, Hotel, or what-not, becomes O'Connor's in name as well as in legal title, to the frequent confusion of topographers. So the theory that explained these changes of name by changes of ownership is just what would naturally occur to a commentator. And the transformations of the hill as pictured in the poem before us are what any intelligent person might evolve out of his inner consciousness. We see in turn the unreclaimed thicket; the site turned to a corn-land ; the elevation of the hill to a military station, when its strategic advantages became evident; the establishment of a royal house ; the founda tion of a royal dynasty. Nothing could be more obviously true: nothing could be farther from the real truth. The only historical value that the poem possesses is its testimony that the hill was known by different names. We need not accept the chronological succession of these names ; they may have been used indiscriminately, perhaps in different parts of the country. Other names, not mentioned in the poem, are recorded elsewhere: O'Clery's Glossary gives us Connalt, .i. tech Cuinn ,i. Temair Breg1; also lios, .i. Temair, to which the lexicographer Peter O'Connell adds "an old name of Tara."2 PD records another name, Druim nDescend, but without comment. The name Eos Temrach is also vouched for in Acallam na Senorach (ed. Stokes, line 1475). The ninth stanza of VD i would seem to imply that there were structures at Temair associated with Tea?a house and a grave. " A rampart was built round her house by Tea the great, daughter of Lugaid; she was buried behind the wall without, so that ' Temair' comes from her." Possibly the Forrad was supposed to have been originally Tea's house. Another important point must be marked for future reference before we pass from this poem. The foundation of the cathair is ascribed to a woman. VD ii is a poem of great obscurity. The author assumes on the part of his readers knowledge, which is no longer accessible ; his allusions are there fore difficult, if not impossible, to understand. The text of the poem will be 1 Jtevne celtique, iv, 390t 2 Ibid., v, 38,</page><page sequence="56">286 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. found in GwynnV edition; it is not necessary to give here more than an abstract of its contents. The numbers in brackets refer to the stanzas? (1) Temair was founded by a woman ; it was obtained as a possession by [Tea] daughter of Lugaid. (2) [Tea] wife of Geide, desired it from her husband as a dower. (3) It was to be a fortress, and afterwards Tea's burial-place. (4) Erem6n had his wife in imprisonment?a reference, probably, to some otherwise lost saga. He gave her what she asked. (5) The palace took its name from Tea, who was buried here. At this stage we pause to note that the same formula is used in the story of the Battle of Cnucha to account for the name of the palace of Almu;, or, rather, it is one of different alternative explanations which the romancer offers of the name. Almu was the wife of Nuadu, the druid of king Cathaeir Mor; and she begged her husband that her name should be on the hill-where: she was buried. In the stanzsis analysed above, the sudden change of the name of Ws husband, from Geide to Erem6n, is embarrassing enough ; but now the dramatis personae change abruptly and completely, and we are plunged into the middle of what at first sight seems to be a totally different story? (6) One Tephi daughter of Forand comes on the scene, who built a strong hold, " fashioning it with her staff and with her brooch.*1 (7) The fortress was called Mur Tephi after Tephi, the king's wife. (8) Mur Tephi in the east, which though a secret place (run) is not hidden, became the centre of the graves of many queens. (9). The house of Tephi was sixty feet square. (10) {Tephi] was a. relative of Baehtir son of Buirech (cin 6 Backtir map Buirig), a native .of Spain, and was abducted by one Camson. (11) Tephi and Cams6n built the Rdith mentioned in the ninth stanza, dia riinad, to conceal her. (12) " The king of Bregon" did not carry off Tephi, "though there was strife between him and Cams6n." (13) Cams6n pledged his god Etherun that he would restore ^ephi [alive or dead]. (14) Tephi died, and Cams6n sent her body in a ship [home to Spain]. (15) repeats (14) in other words, adding that the grave of Tephi was called Tephi-run. (16) Temair was built in imitation of Tephi's grave. (17) All places that are lofty and conspicuous are called Temair after this site. (18, 19) A collection of tags and chevilles, of no importance, but containing an allusion to the final destruction of Temair. The preface to the account of Temair in PD gives us some help to an understanding of this incomprehensible medley. Temair, we are there informed, is the mitr or wall of Tea daughter of Lugaid son of Ith, the wife of Geide Ollgothach. Or it is Teipe-mur, the mur or wall of Tephi, daughter of Baehtir king of Spain; she lived with Canthoh (sic), son of Caithmiu king of Britain. Etherun, the idol of the Britons, had been given as security for her return to Spain alive or dead, She w$s buried in Spain, and the rampart</page><page sequence="57">Macalister?Temair Breg Remains and Traditions of Tara. 287 built around her was called Teipe-mur. It was seen by Tea wife of Eremon (sic), and when she came to Ireland with her husband from Spain she followed it as a model in building her own fortification; and she erected a rampart like that of Tephi, on every hill that she chose as a fortress. No one could blame any impatient reader who would protest, at this point, that it is utterly impossible to extract any sense or reason out of all this farrago. Certain sciolists, he might very justly say, wished to find by hook or by crook an etymology for the name of Temair, and to do so they invented a story of quite unusual silliness. But we are not entitled to brush aside the legend in so cavalier a manner. In the first place, we note that if the tale had been invented merely for the purpose of explaining the origin of the name of Temair, the inventors would have rested content with the, for them, brilliant inspiration of Tea Mur, and would not have embarrassed themselves with Tephi at all. It is quite clear that the Dindshenchas writers, both prose and verse, were more interested in the etymology than in the romance : and it is also obvious that Tephi was very much in their way; she was in the story, but they did not know what to do with her. The whole Tephi fatuity, as it appears to be at first sight, is really one of the best arguments against the story being merely a philological invention, and for the etymologies being an adaptation of something that was already in existence. In the second place, the story exists in several versions, and, indeed, we can trace two versions combined together in the Dindshenchas tale, which made Tea the wife, in the one version of Eremon, and in the other of Geide. An inventor would not have introduced this unnecessary complication. Lebor Gabdla gives a different form of the story, which will be found (inter alia) in LL 13 b. According to this, Tea was the daughter of Lugaid mac Itha, and was wife of Eremon, the mother of his youngest son Iridl; Eremon had deserted his previous wife Odba in Spain, in order to attach himself to Tea. Odba, however, came in a ship to Ireland, with Muimne, Luigne. and Laigne, the three sons that she had borne to Eremon ; and she was in Ireland till she died and was buried in the hill of Odba, near Navan. Meanwhile, Tea had begged of Eremon a heritage and a burial-place, and he had given her Druim ("din, as it was then called. Seemingly Odba here takes the place of Tephi, and the Camson incident is ignored. Cormac the glossator knew the story, and refers to it (s. v. Temair). It is to be noted that Tephi is said to have laid out her stronghold with the aid of her staff and her brooch. The same expression is used in speaking of the foundation of JEmain Macha by queen Macha; and it is there adapted by the etymologizers to give some sort of derivation for the word Emain (LL 20 b 50). The story of the brooch has no etymological point in the story B.I.A. PROC, VO^. XXXIV, SECT. C. [40]</page><page sequence="58">288 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. before us, and its presence here seems to show that it existed as a folk-lore element independently of the use made of it in explaining the name of the Ultonian palace.1 This illustrates the contention here made, that the Dindshenchas tales existed in folk-legend independently of the etymologies founded upon them. We may throw overboard the philological fatras of Dindshenchas 'Erenn and similar works, but we cannot thereby evade the duty of trying to make what we can of the stories on which it is based. In these legends cf the origin of Temair, analysis shows seven elements that call for consideration, which we now proceed to examine. These are as follows :? A. The Tephi Legend. (i) The personality of Tephi. (ii) Her father Forann. (iii) Bachtir and Camson. (iv) The god Etherun. B. The Tea Legend (v) The personality of Tea. (vi) The attribution of the foundation of Temair to Tea. (vii) Who was the husband of Tea ? A. Tephi. (i) The attentive reader of the Tephi stanzas in VD ii cannot fail to be struck by the insistence which they display on the word rim. The writer's mind is obsessed, perhaps unconsciously, with the idea of a " mystery " while he is dealing with this lady; and finally he tells us that the grave of the dead princess was called " Tephi-run," which means, if it means anything, " the Tephi mystery."3 A grave is doubtless a dark and mysterious place; nevertheless, this is not a satisfactory name for a grave, and the author's statements do not satisfactorily explain the word. Nor could anyone, even an ancient Irish etymologizer, be content with " Tephi-run " as an interpreta tion of " Temair," even if he had not had before him the evidently much better etymology Tea Mur. Surely this implies that the word Tephi-run, whatever its meaning, existed in some form before anyone thought of extorting the derivation of the name of Temair out of it. It reminds us not a little of the tZSi n oo(pta ioriv, with which the seer of visions in the Apocalypse introduces 1 A modern example of the same etymological myth will be found in the story called Fionn mac Gnmhaill 7 a mhdthair (Seosamh Laoide, Sgealaidhe Oirghiall, p. 38). 2 The word is evidently cast into this form by the poet to give a rhyme for Sthetnin, is reference to VD ii 60 will show.</page><page sequence="59">Macalister?Temair Brtg; Remains dnd Traditions of Tara. 28? his famous cryptogram commonly called the Number of the Beast. The word seems to say to us: " Here is a mystery; what is ' Tephi' ?" Before we try to solve the enigma, we must first ask ourselves, why should there be a mystery at all-? And we have little difficulty in finding an answer to this question. The struggle between Christianity and Paganism in these islands is a subject that has hardly as yet been systematically studied. It has been too readily assumed, for example, that because there is little or no record of martyrdom in Ireland the triumph of the Cross must here have been easy and immediate. It should not be forgotten, in criticizing these and similar assumptions, that all the records which we possess are comparatively late; they have come down to us from, the hands of adherents of the religion that ultimately conquered, and from a time when th$t religion had gained complete ascendancy. To get at the full truth, so far as it is at all possible to do so, we must read between the lines. When we do so, we find that Christianity had in reality a hard struggle to establish itself in the hearts of the inhabi tants of this country. We shall hear several echoes of the strife as we proceed in our present study; and it is not irrelevant to observe that we must be prepared for three phenomena?syncretism, spite, and secrecy. (a) Syncretism implies that the people while accepting the new teaching do not relinquish the old ; they merely add Christ to their pantheon. The parents who, according to a frequently repeated story, left the right arms of their infants unbaptized, in order that they might be strong to strike the crueller blows on their enemies, were good examples of this religious pheno menon. But the most remarkable illustration of syncretism afforded by the antiquities of these islands is the sculpture on the monumental stones found in the land of the Scottish Picts. It is wTell knowTn that these monuments fall into three groups. In the first and oldest, we find no crosses, but a rich and very obscure system of pictorial symbolism?animals, crescents, circles, and other signs, some forty in number. The symbols are incised, and there are no other devices on the stones. In the second group we find the same symbokvm relief, accompanied with elaborate crosses. The interlacings and other ornamental motives associated with Celtic Christian art appear for the first time in Scotland on the stones of the second group, and it is important to observe that the extremely delicate minuteness of this decoration is a proof that the Scottish sculptors here followed the models set them by manuscripts, not the traditions enshrined in other sculptured stones. In fact we see clear evidence in these stones of the influence of the foreign missionary, with his illuminated gospels and service-books. In the third group the symbols wholly disappear, but the crosses and allied patterns survive. The [40*J</page><page sequence="60">290 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. subject will be found elaborately worked out, artistically, topographically, and chronologically, in Eomilly Allen's Early Christian Monuments of Scotland; but the author of that magnificent book makes no attempt to explain the symbols?of which, indeed, no satisfactory explanation has as yet been offered. I have devoted some attention to this problem, taking into account the fact that the symbols are also used in the decoration of metal objects, and sometimes in graffiti. I have considered the symbols in turn as marks of tribe or of trade ; as Christian emblems; and even as the characters of some hiero glyphic system of syllabic writing. In every case I have found insuperable objections to the interpretation attempted. I find myself at last forced to adopt the conclusion that they are not Christian symbols at all, but Pagan; that they are probably marks associated, in the minds of those who made tise of them, with different deities, surviving and flourishing side by side with a newly introduced Christianity. They are in fact invocations of the various pagan gods, just as we may see invocations of Odin or of Thor on pagan Eunic inscriptions. When Christianity was first introduced among the Picts, they* did not see their way to abandon their ancient gods all at once. For a time they tried to set themselves right with the deities of their fathers and with the new Faith ; they carved on their monuments the symbols of the old and the Cross of the new.1 The first group of stones, then, are on this theory Pagan monuments; the second transitional, erected before the missionaries could fully enforce that exclusion of all other gods which is a cardinal principle of Christianity; the third group belong to a time when the old gods were dead, and when the Cross had triumphed. Some of the Scottish stones bear Ogham inscriptions, which have taxed in vain the last resources of our most accomplished philologists?as well as some of the others?to interpret. Most of these inscriptions are grave-formulae in the Pictish language, and as that language is dead and forgotten, and its very placfe in the classification of languages is unknown, we can have very little hope of ever completely understanding them. But others look like something else; and I suggest that they are invocations of the names of pagan Pictish gods. This is not so far-fetched an interpretation as it may appear to be, for on one stone at least?that at Papa Stronsay in the Orkneys?the fashion is carried into Christianity, and the only inscription on the stone is an invoca tion of the Christian God. We may compare the "ejaculation" DNE, 1 The famous Ottrava font, which bears a sculptured figure of Thor incongruously associated with Christian symbols, offers an exact parallel. See Professor George Stephens' brochure, Thunor the Thunderer (London : Williams &amp; Norgate, 1878).</page><page sequence="61">Macalister?Temair Br eg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 291 carved on the cross-slab of Beisk and on the alphabet-stone of Kilmalkedar, in Co. Kerry. All this is not so remote from the subject before us as the reader will naturally be tempted to suppose. As we shall presently see, the sculptured stones of the Picts, the representatives of the pre-Celtic bronze-age people who founded Temair, have some light to throw on the problems of its early history; and it is important to understand clearly how it is here proposed to interpret them. (b) The odium theologicum between adherents of rival religions takes the form (1) of profane nicknames used by the supporters of one faith for the gods and holy places of the other; (ii) of improper stories told of the opposi tion deities; (iii) of miscellaneous forms of mockery. We have examples of all three in Irish literature. Of the first, we may take as an example the nickname Cromm Cruaich, of which we must speak later. There is no satis factory evidence that this was ever the real name of a deity. We may compare also Diabul Ard and Tarothor (lege Torathor), already mentioned on p. 257, and the names given in Cormac's Glossary to the wife of The Dagda. The worshippers of the gods thus scornfully designated, retaliated by calling the Sacred Figure on the Crucifix An Crochaire Tarmochtuighthe, a name still current in folk-tales told by good Christians, who are blissfully ignorant of its true meaning.1 Of the second form of religious spite we may take as an illustration, from the Christian side, such a tale as The Second Battle of Moytura,2 where the deity known as The Dagda is placed in a number of ridi culous and, to speak mildly, undignified situations. On the pagan side we may instance the story called Aided Diarmada,3 in which the half-heathen king Diarmait and Saint Buadan of Lorrha fling preposterous curses at one another, those of the king being effective and those of the saint, at least in what we may presume to have been the original version of the story, power 1 The meaning is obscured by translating it "The Naked Hangman." The word crochaire, though now used principally in the sense '* hangman," also means " a hanged persdn," and is sometimes applied to the Figure on the Cross ; cf. cret in dealbh croiche ut 7 m Crochaire innti, Book of Lismore 69 b 1. 2 Revue celtique, xii, 52. The reference in the text is to the story in its present literary form, which is an uncouth exhibition of Eabelaisian humour. It is doubtless founded on much earlier traditional materials. 3 Silva Gadelica, i, 72. This tale, at first a piece of rough humour, was later taken seriously by writers unable to believe that the saint's curses could possibly be impotent; and they based upon it the legend of the destruction of Temair in or shortly after 563 a.d. But, as Professor MacNeill has pointed out, this alleged desertion of Temair is altogether inconsistent with the later history. On the other hand, the Prologue of FeUire Oengusso, line 165, shows that Temair was of small importance in the ninth century, when that poem was written.</page><page sequence="62">292 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. less. Of the third form of spite it will suffice to quote here the unedifying wrangling of Oisin and Patrick in the so-called Ossianic poems. (c) Secrecy, on the part of the adherents of a weaker faith, is necessary to avert persecution. While the Christian faith was struggling for existence, its followers made use of secret signs and passwords whereby they could recognize one another. Contrariwise, the mysteries were the last stronghold of Paganism when the Cross had triumphed.1 And so, to return to the point from which we set out on this digression, I think we may take it that " the mystery of Tephi" is some such secret. It was a private way of refer ring to a divine being, invented when Christianity had reduced the rival faiths to impotence. At least, let us for the moment assume this to be the case, and let us now inquire what divine being might be supposed to lie hidden under the personality of Tephi. Tephi is called "daughter of Forann." This is the same word as the Irish equivalent of Pharaoh, the title of the king of Egypt; Tephi therefore is spoken of, and was doubtless understood by the writer of VD ii as being, the daughter of the king of Egypt. He was not troubled by the improba bility of such a princess being at the same time a relative of " Bachtir of Spain," and We need not feel any more uneasiness on the subject than he did. Two other daughters of Forann make their appearance in the legends of Irish oi*igines. These women were both called Scota; and though by the annalists they are separated from one another by a number of generations, they are clearly doublets of one another. This " Scota daughter of Pharaoh " is the prime cause of the devious wanderings of the children of Mil over the face of the earth, before finding a permanent home in Ireland. The children of Mil were called "Scots "; one school of etymologists derived this ethnic name from Scythia, and so the tribe had to be brought on its wild journey to Scythia in order that it might pick up the name. But another school of etymologists favoured an eponymous ancestress, " Scota daughter of Forann," understood as being the daughter of Pharaoh. To secure this ancestress, the tribe had to make its way to Egypt. Finally, when the redactors attempted to make one story out of all the scattered tales that lay before them, they found that different accounts were given of the husband whom Scota married and of the children whom she bore. In order to work these all in, the lady had to be duplicated, thus necessitating two different voyages to Egypt in different generations. Such is the evolution of the story of the wanderings of the children of Mil, helped out by tags borrowed from the wanderings of the Israelites and from other sources. Here again, as in the case of Tea, the fact that the historians were 1 See Farnell, Gults of the Greek States, iii, 127.</page><page sequence="63">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 293 embarrassed by a variety of mutually contradictory legends is sufficient to show that the story of Scota is no mere invention, devised to give some sort of etymology for the ethnic name of the " Scots." Essentially the story of Scota is a popular tale of a divine ancestress ; though the name of the ancestress may have been artificially modified, by the men of learning who systematized the stories into the form in which we have them, in order to improve the analogy between the two words compared. If we could have recovered the tale of this ancestress from the lips of the common people, we would not necessarily find that " Scota " was the exact form in which they would have given her name to us, or that the idea of the derivation of the ethnic was at all uppermost or even present in their minds. Such artificial modifications of proper names, in the interests of etymology, are not unknown in Irish historical literature; we may instance the constant habit of spelling the name Finnachta with an interpolated shn, as though it were Finn-shneehta, " white snowT," or Fin-shnechta, " wine-snow." The story of Scota's parentage leads us to a further inference; namely, that not only are the two " Scotas" to be treated as one and the same legendary personality, of whom different stories were told; but that Tepqi also is to be regarded as identical with them. Herein lies " the mystery of Tephi." Bat, it will fairly be asked, what possible connexion can there be between the names of Scota and Tephi ? One method of linking these words may be suggested. Suppose we write the name Scota in Ogham letters on a circular stem-line (fig. 3 a), and then manipulate its letters symmetrically, making the first three strokes of the S, and the last three strokes of the 0, into vowel scores (fig. 3 b). Then, regrouping the vowels, and beginning to read at the T (fig. 3 c), we obtain tebhi. According to the principles of Ogham orthography, H is not here the sign of lenition, so that the word would be pronounced leb-hi, not tevi. To preserve so far as possible this pronunciation, the unlenited b is written p (as it usually is after vowels in Old Irish), when the Ogham is transliterated. For purposes of comparison, a facsimile of an actual " wheel" of the kind imagined is added to fig. 3 (fig. 3 d). It occurs on the stone at Logie Elphinstone, Aberdeenshire, in association with certain of the Pictish symbols, to which reference has been made on a previous page. These scores are certainly cryptographic, but the key to their decipherment has not yet been discovered. The puerile cryptograms on the great Bunic stone at Bok, Sweden, are of the same character.1 Reams of nonsense have been written, trying to make cryptograms out of the straightforward memorial inscriptions in Ogham ; this way of interpretation</page><page sequence="64">294 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. has proved an absolute cul de sac, and is now universally discredited. But that the Ogham character was on occasion used for cryptical purposes may be taken as certain. The series of Ogham alphabets in the Book of Ballymote is no mere vacuous pastime of the scribe of that compilation ; it is a treatise on cryptography, a collection of the variants of the Ogham alphabet invented and used from time to time by ingenious literati for purposes of secrecy. Besides the Logie " wheel," we possess two cryptographic inscriptions in Ogham?the formula lmcbdv on the Glenfahan stone, and the similar formula lmcbtm on the bead-amulet from Ennis. I have not succeeded in hitting upon the solution of these riddles, but I am inclined to believe that the name of a pagan god, or perhaps the initials of a number of names of gods, T Fig. 3?The " Wheel-ogham " Cypher. may lie concealed under these strings of consonants. If this interpretation of these inscriptions be correct, the Glenfahan stone would be of especial importance in this connexion. It would be a valuable monument of the syncretism which we have already endeavoured to trace in the Pictish sculptured stones. The setter-up of the monument was at a loss to choose between the old faith and the new. He tried to make his peace with both by carving an elaborate cross on the face of the stone, and by invoking the old gods in his cypher on the edge. It is not difficult to understand why the inscription should be in cypher, for the maker of the monument well knew what would happen if he had written the god's name without concealment. 1 See Sophus Bugge, Der fiunenstein von Rok (Stockholm, 1910).</page><page sequence="65">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains und Traditions of Tara. 295 I think that I was the first to point out that in Ogham inscriptions couchefldn the formula A maqi mucoi B, in which the descent of the deceased is traced not from his father but from a remote eponymous ancestor, the second name, that of the ancestor, is very frequently broken off while the rest of the inscription is left intact; and this almost always seems to be a work of intentional violence. I completely missed the true interpretation, however, which is certainly that given by Professor MacNeill1; namely, that the ancestral name is that of a divinity, which would naturally be destroyed when some enthusiastic Christian iconoclast came across it. I therefore suggest that Scota was an eponymous ancestress of the Scotic people, to whom divine honours were paid, and that Tephi was a crypto graphic way of referring to her, devised at the time when Christianity had become the strongest faith in. the country. (ii) The next question that arises in connexion, with Tephi is the interpre tation to be put upon the statement that she was a daughter of Forann. It is not to be understood that she was originally supposed to have been a daughter of the king of Egypt, though this explanation, doubtless, became current in later times. We are to see in Forann a native name, which later historians misunderstood. Sir John Rhys long ago suggested a comparison between this name and that of Fer on, mentioned in the legends of Irish origines.2 According to one story, preserved by Keating,3 Parthol6n, the first post-diluvian invader of Ireland, had four sons, named Er, Orba, Feron, and Fergna. Another tradition made these four the sons of Eber, brother of Eremon, the first king of the Milesians, and assigned to them a reign of half a year in joint rule, some little time after the establishment of the Milesian kingdom.4 There is, on the whole, a general similarity between the legends of Partholon, Nemed, and the Fir Bolg, close enough to justify us in regarding them as variants of one and the same group of tales?namely, the tales that the aboriginal pre-Celtic people of the country told about their own beginnings. This being premised, it may be considered as at least probable that the four leaders of the expedition whereby these autochthones were said to have been settled in a previously desert Ireland, were the ancestral deities of the pre Celtic tribes. Accordingly, we find the same quartette appearing in another guise, as those of the sons of Nemed, the second post-diluvian invader of the country. As there given, they are Starn, Iarbonel, Fergus, Ainnind.5 The 1 Proceedings R.I.

EE OEBA FEEGna stAEn iAEBOnel FEEGus ?may not be very striking when the names are considered separately ; but when they are considered in a group the analogies almost amount to a demonstration that the first list is a broken-down form of the second, pro bably derived from some half-illegible record. That Feron does not bear any resemblance to Ainnind I explain on the theory that the group was at first a triplicity, as such god-groups usually are, and that the fourth was a variously-named later addition. With all possible reserve I venture to record an idea which has occurred to me: that we have an invocation of this triplicity on a very remarkable stone in Pictland. This is the well-known monument at St Vigean's, Forfarshire, which will be found well illustrated in Allen's book (cited above), p. 236. On one face of the stone is an ornamented cross, the upper part of which is now broken away ; on the other face are some of the " Pictish " symbols, with one of the enigmatical hunting scenes so common on the Pictish stones. Low down on one edge of the stone is a small panel bearing the words DBOSTEN IPEUOEET ETTFOE cus I well remember the surprise I felt, when I saw this stone many years ago, at the inconsjncuousness of this inscription ; it is, as it were, thrust out of sight, as though the writer were half ashamed of it. It is not more prominent than the names which monumental masons cut on modern tombstones to advertise themselves. This would scarcely be intelligible if the purpose of the in scription had been to perpetuate the name and parentage of the owner of the monument. But if it were the memorial of a syncretism, in which the pagan faiths were " recessive " and the Christian "dominant," we might understand a pagan inscription being put in the background in this way. Not one of numerous attempts that have been made to interpret this inscription can be said to carry conviction. There is therefore room for another suggestion, though I can scarcely hope to have succeeded where so many have failed. But it is undeniable that there exists at least a superficial resemblance between the words on the stone and the names of the triplicity set forth above ; drosten suggests Starn} ipeuoret corresponds to Iarbonel, and forcus</page><page sequence="67">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 297 to Fergus. The interpolated ett would then be simply the Latin et, learnt, with the forms of the letters in which the inscription is cut, and the accom panying cross with its ornamentation, from the missionaries. On this hypothesis, the St Vigean's inscription would give us the original pre-Celtic forms of these names, those in the Celtic documents being corruptions.1 1 may remind the reader of the illustration I have used in a previous paper2?the trans formation of the names of Eudus and Mael-Oinae, heads of Clonmacnois, into Eogan and Nael-Tuile in all the Annals?which shows that there is scarcely any limit to the possibilities of corruption in proper names, even when these are familiar. The change oilpeuoret to larbonel, which is perhaps the most violent of those suggested, will not seem so difficult when we remember the similarity of p to 11, 11 to Tl, and U to t, in the so-called " Irish " capitals, especially if these are not very carefully written.3 It is not difficult to recognize the same quaternity once more in the names of the four persons recorded as having escaped the universal deluge, Finntan Feron, Fors, and Andoid.4 Here Feron and his double Ainnind (Andoid) appear together, while Finntan and Fors take the place of the others. The name Feron appears to occur in a similar invocation on the Newton stone. The beginning of this inscription is aiddarrnnn vorrenn. Reason will presently be given for seeing in the first of these words the name of a god; and the analogies already suggested perhaps make it at least admissible that Vorrenn is to be similarly treated. Feron would thus be an artificial corruption of the name of a very ancient deity, made by interchanging the vowels. We have thus reduced the mysterious Tephi daughter of Pharaoh to a Celtic divine ancestress Scota, considered as the daughter of a pre-Celtic deity called Forenn. But why should this Celtic ancestress be made the daughter of a pre-Celtic divinity ? To this question, at first sight difficult, a simple and convincing answer is at hand. 11 is a device of the Celtic invaders, who came in at the beginning of the iron-age culture, to establish their claim to the possession of the land. Baudis6 has ingeniously explained the songs of Amergin as hymns designed to propitiate the unknown deities of a country 1 There seems to be a contamination with another triplicity, namely, the three "gods of the Tuatha De Danann," called Brian, Iuchar, Iucharba. The names Iuch-AR, Iuch-AEBA, are reminiscent of the first two names of the Partholon triplicity. 2 Proc. R.I.A., xxxiii, C, p. 106. 3 That ghost-words produced thus, by misreadings of manuscripts, can attain to vitality is shown by such examples as Hebrides, Iona, celt (= chisel), and uncial, derived from misreadings of Mbudae, loua, caelo, and initiales. 4 Keating's History, I.T.S. edition, i, 184. 6 kriu, viii, p. 102. [41*]</page><page sequence="68">298 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy* which the singers are invading. One of the most familiar devices for establish ing a treaty with the gods of a conquered country is to affiliate them to the gods of the conquerors. Much of the Greek Theogonia has its roots in this custom, and we can very reasonably trace it here. The Celtic-speaking people, coming into the country with their Scota, declared that she was the offspring of the aboriginal Forenn, and thereby put forward the strongest claim they could make to the possession of the country. Some further suggestions as to Scota's personality must for the present be postponed. (iii) The saga which connected Tephi-Scota with Bachtir and with Camson is lost, except in the allusions of the poem before us, and there is no light from any other source to throw on these obscure names.1 The " king of Bregon," with whom Camson was at enmity, can hardly be dissociated from Breogan, the grandfather of Mil, traditional ancestor of the Milesian or Celtic invaders. Camson, the son of the king of Britain, would thus be a non-Celt, and we now begin to see indicated a legend told to account for the invasion of the Milesians. The orthodox story is to the effect that the expedition was first undertaken to avenge on the Tuatha De Danann the murder of Ith son of Breogan ; but that other tales were current before the historians formu lated the " official" history of the country can hardly be doubted. Probably, according to this story, Camson abducted Scota-Tephi from Spain, and the ex pedition was set in motion to avenge the outrage. But this does not altogether exhaust the possibilities of reconstruction, as we shall presently see. (iv). Camson had a god Etherun, on which a word or two must be said. Petrie, not unnaturally, compared this name to that of Taranis, the Gaulish deity named in an oft-quoted passage of Lucan. The vowels, however, seem irreconcilable with this identification; and moreover we do not appear to have any very clear evidence of Taranis-worship in these islands. I at one time thought that in Etherun we were to see a scribal error for Mcheriin treating this as some sort of corruption of the name Cernunnos. This however assumes the undemonstrable hypothesis that Cernunnos was known in Ireland under the same name as on the Continent; and as Camson, on the theory here advanced, was a pre-Celtic personage, he must have had a pre-Celtic god. We must therefore look elsewhere for Etherun, and once more Pictland comes to our assistance. Two of the Scottish Ogham stones?that from Scoonie, Fifeshire, now in Edinburgh Museum, and that at Brodie Park in Elginshire?bear a word eddarrnonn. On the former stone it constitutes the entire inscription; on the latter it is the only word now legible in what appears to have been 1 With the exception of one solitary ray on Camson, to be mentioned later.</page><page sequence="69">MacalisteH? Temair Breg { Remains and Traditions of Tara. 299 an inscription of some considerable length. The word appears again as AIDDARRNNN1 on the New ton stone. At Fordoun in Kincardineshire there is an inscription that at one time was contained in at least two lines of minuscular letters : the upper line is now effaced, but the lower can be read pidarnoin. The p is probably the last letter of a word begun in the previous line, which leaves us with the same word in the form idarnoin. ' It is not probable that this word is to be taken as a personal name, though as it forms the whole inscription on the Scoonie stone, that would pHmcc facie be the most natural interpretation. For, as it occurs on four out of some twenty stones scattered all over Pictland, the inference would then be inevitable that it was one of the commonest of Pictish names. We should therefore look for it in such a document as the Pictish Chronicle, which mentions a considerable number of Pictish individuals; but we should look in vain. On the other hand, it cannot be taken as a grave-formula ("here lies" or the like) which is the interpretation at one time suggested by Sir John Rhys*; for in that case it would have been associated with a proper name on the Scoonie stone, and would not have formed the entire inscription. Remembering what we have said above, of the Pictish stones being apparently the memorials of a syncretism, in which pagan faiths mingle strangely with Christianity, we shall perhaps not greatly err if in eddarrnonn, as in the otherwise incomprehensible symbols, we see the invocation of a pre-Christian divinity; and we may fairly ask ourselves if we are not to see this Pictish divinity, thus recovered, in the Etherun of the poem before us. The spelling of the Newton stone, aiddarrnnn, without the vowel, is of some importance. It suggests that the last syllable of the name was a nasalised vowel, and that the scribe was in difficulties as to how to express this sound in the exotic Ogham character.3 This, and the different spellings of the word in the inscrip tions, would lead us to infer that the pronunciation of the name, in Pictish, j. **&gt; ' was something like ? $ 9 r O, which the Ethertin of the Irish poem would very fairly represent. B. Tea. (v). So much, then, for Tephi and her associates. What are we to make of Tea? 1 This word has previously been read aiddaiqnnn, owing to the uncertainty of the rounded angle of the stone, and to a natural desire to establish a connexion between the Ogham and the associated inscription in blundered Roman letters. But there can be no question that the real reading is that given above. 2 Proc. Soc. of Ant. Scot, xxvi, 282. 3 Much the same remark may be made about the ng in reirng, the letters with which the Goldspie inscription terminates. Sir John Ehys (loc. cit.) has, I see, made the same suggestion.</page><page sequence="70">300 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Tea is called daughter of Lugaid mac Itha. This Lugaid was said to be cousin of the tribal ancestor Mil, Ith being the brother of his (Mil's) father. Scota, according to one of the stories about her, was wife of Mil, and mother of his numerous family of sons, chief though not eldest of whom was Eremon, who according to one of the traditions married Tea. Tea thus works out as daughter-in-law of Seota, and second cousin of Eremon. The details of importance in this genealogy are the heroine's descent from Ith, "corn," and her marriage to Eremon, the "ploughman." Tea thus is an impersonation of the spirit of vegetation. We shall see abundant evidence that the rites which centred in the ridge of Temair were associated with agricultural festivals; and that the corn-spirit should have been regarded as the cause of the foundation of the worship of the site is thus all the more probable. When in the light of this identification we look back at the scanty and confused record of the story of Tea and Tephi, we begin to wonder whether their roles have not somehow become reversed. For the story of the abduc tion of Tephi by Camson has one very peculiar feature in it. This is the promise made by Camson to return Tephi, alive or dead. Such promises are not usually made under such circumstances in folk-tales?except in one group, namely that of which the deathless story of Demeter and Kore is the crown and type. Here, too, we have a rape with a promise of a return. The winter time gives place to the spring, and Pluto gives back Persephone, the corn spirit. In the very fragmentary condition of the Irish legend, it is impossible to develop the analogies thus suggested in detail. But it is clear that if Tea be the corn-spirit, and Tephi the tribal ancestress, the story of the abduction would be more likely to have the former for heroine than the latter. I suspect that in the original version this was so ; and perhaps that Tephi (Scota) the mother (riot mother-in-law) of Tea played the part of Demeter. But the tale has become confused in the telling, and has not been improved by the dry-as dusts who were interested in it only as a source for an etymology. In the poem on Temair Luachra in Kerry, contained in Dindshenchas Erenn, f\ ea is again mentioned, but no additional facts are recorded of her except that she came from Tirfd Thninn, that is, from Elysium in one of its many manifestations. (vi). In all the welter of confused traditions and etymologies with which we have been hitherto concerned in the present section, one fact of very great importance stands out prominently ; the indication that Temair was believed to owe its origin to a woman. Had this been an isolated case it would have been injudicious to attach much importance to it; but we know that it was actually the rule. All the important oenach and palace sites in Ireland are alleged to have been founded by women, who gave their names to the places</page><page sequence="71">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 301 where they were established. Tlachtga, Emain Macha, Tailltiu, Carman, occur to the mind at once in this connexion, and form a body of cumulative evidence that cannot be rejected on the ground that the tales, as they have reached us, show marks of late manipulation for philological purposes. 'Taken in connexion with the matrilinear law of succession among the Piets, well attested by Bede and by other writers, as well as by the Pictish list of kings, these tales must mean that the founders of the monarchies, or the establishes of the rites, at the places referred to, did so by right of their wives or of their mothers : in other words, that descent was reckoned in the female line. Such a system did not exist in Ireland after the establishment of the Celtic regimey at the beginning of the Iron Age; the traditions must therefore in their essence reach back to the Bronze Age, and therefore fall into line with the archaeological evidence for a bronze-age origin for Temair, which we have already found. A different story is told in VD i, assigning the foundation of Temair to one Croiind, daughter of Allod. For the present we content ourselves with noting that this story also speaks of a foundress. Allod is a divine name; its owner, indeed, was the brother of The Dagda, and he appears as a tribal ancestor on several Ogham stones. As we shall see later, this mention of Crofind is of great importance: but meanwhile we must look a little more closely at the princess Tea from another point of view. (vii). The author of VD ii has endeavoured vainly to slur over an incon sistency in Tea's matrimonial connexions: in one place she is called the wife of Eremon, the leader of the Milesian, i.e. the Celtic expedition to Ireland; in another place she appears as the wife of a certain Geide Oll-gothach. If we take the chronology of the Four Masters, which will serve as well as any other, we learn that Eremon with his braves landed in Ireland Anno Mundi 3500, and that he died in 3516; while Geide Oll-gothach reigned from 3960 to 3971, about four and a-half centuries later. How are we to explain this inconsistency ? To answer this question we must first inquire as briefly as possible into the origin of what for convenience 1 may call the " official history," i.e. the history of Ireland enshrined in the Books of Annals, Lebor Gabala, Keating, and other writings, from which the dates just given and others like them are to be extracted. That the " official history " is an artificial compilation, based on Scriptural and Classical synchronisms, is obvious. But of what elements is the compilation made up ? Prof. MacNeill, in his paper on Ogham inscriptions, published in vol. xxvii of the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, has shown clearly that these inscriptions represent a totally different orthographical tradition from th$</page><page sequence="72">302 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Irish of the MSS.; and that while the Irish of the mss. represents a Christian tradition, dating from the earliest ages of Christianity in the country, the Ogham inscriptions represent a pagan tradition. It follows beyond the' possibility of question that there must necessarily have been a certain amount of literary culture in the country for at least a century or two before the coming of the Christian missionaries. As I have said in a paper already published by the Academy,1 "the ground-work of this literary cul ture was, no doubt, the poems which according to Caesar were committed to memory by the pupils in the druidic schools'?most likely Veda-like sacred and semi-magical hymns and formulae of various kinds." The analogy with the Vedas suggested in the above quotation is exact, and explains several otherwise inexplicable phenomena in Irish literature. These traditional hymns, like the Vedas at the beginning of their existence, were never written down, as Caesar goes on to tell us: it follows that they would preserve in memory an archaic form of language, just as the Vedas preserve Old Sanskrit, and as the ritual of the Fratres Arvales enshrined an archaic form of Latin. After this we are not surprised to learn that the study of these poems occupied no less than twenty years; at the end of which time the literati would be so steeped in the sacred language that they would naturally use it as the basis of literary composition. To the large illiterate majority this archaic language would be totally unintelligible?as much so as Latin would be to an illiterate Frenchman or Italian. When the Christian missionaries arrived in Ireland, they found much the same condition of things prevailing as modern missionaries have found in China. The current language of daily intercourse was a colloquial, which was never written; while the language used for writing, by those few who possessed the art, was an archaic form of speech, familiar to the "mandarins," but incomprehensible to the unlearned. To instruct those whom they had come to teach, the missionaries in ancient Ireland solved the problem thus presented to them as the missionaries in modern China have solved it. They elevated the colloquial speech to the level of a literary language, writing it after a newly devised phonetic system; and they created a literature by translating into it such of the ancient traditions as moral or religious expe diency permitted them to translate. It need hardly be said that no archaic, pre-Christian, literature in vellum mss. is to be postulated3; tablets of wood, 1 Proceedings, vol. xxxii, section C, p. 231. 3 De Bello Gallico, VI, xiv, 3. t ? Though possibly the books of Longarad were written in this archaic dialect. They survived till the time of the writing of the annotations to FSilire Oengusso (Bradshaw edn., p. 198); but were unintelligible, owing, tradition said, to a curse uttered by Colum Oille.</page><page sequence="73">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 303 with or without a covering of wax, were doubtless the materials on which the documents were written. In criticizing the contents of Irish historical documents, we must always be prepared to look back from the writings as we have them to the archaic records from which, on this hypothesis, they have been translated. In this, and in no other way, can the following phenomena be explained:? (a) The use of an archaic language in the Ogham inscriptions. 'These cannot possibly be so old as the time when, for instance, the natural way of expressing the genitive of the word for "son" was maqi. There was, doubtless, once such a stage of the spoken language; nothing but a carefully treasured and meticulously studied body of traditional literature could have preserved the memory of such ancient forms down to the time when they began to be written in Ogham. (b) The archaeological accuracy of romances like Tain Bo Citalnge; which though written in their present form in or about the seventh or eighth century a.d., reproduce the life of the first or second century B.C. Something more than mere oral tradition must have existed, to preserve the memory of the details of La Tene civilization which Professor Ridgeway has detected and set forth in his well-known monograph On the Date of the first Shaping of the Cuehullainn Saga.1 (c) The non-metrical character of certain early poems; such as the concluding lines of Amergin's Am goeth immuir? which may, perhaps, be actually a translation of a hymn of one of the Druidic "Vedas." These may be presumed to have been regularly metrical in their archaic form, but to have lost their metre through translation, just as would an ode of Horace if it were to be translated literally, line for line, into Italian. (d) The streams of nonsense, dignified by the name of " retoricc," occa sionally introduced into the prose romances. These, at first at least, were nothing but the bungling of an incompetent translator: though in the later imitative literature they became an artificial pose.3 Such a text as Briathar chath Ban nUlad must have been almost Homeric in its original form, with its stately roll of inflexions; the version which we possess is on the level of a sixpenny " crib " to the Iliad. On such materials, then, the " official history " is ultimately based. The tales were told by the professional story-tellers and historians, at first enshrined in their memories; afterwards, when they became acquainted with 1 Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. ii. - The translator has been able to cast the first part of this rhapsody into a metrical form, owing to its regular structure. 3 As in Aided Oonchobuir (Todd Lectures, xiv, 10).

The work of the succession of historians, who hammered the " official history " into shape, consisted in selecting, synchronising, and arranging, on principles not always easy to discover, the Orphic fragments which the change of religion had permitted to survive. In the discrepancy as to the matri monial relations of Tea we have a very welcome peep behind the scenes. We see at once that Tea is no mere etymological figment, for otherwise there would be no such discrepancy. Our historians must often have come across the contradictions and inconsistencies familiar to all folk-lorists who study popular legends told of ancient historical characters. When the synthesis of scraps which we have here called the " official history " was finally evolved, and became a regular subject of instruction in the schools, fragments not consistent with it had but a small chance of surviving; it is only by good luck that now and then one of these pariahs of Irish tradition succeeds in worming its way into literature. One of these happy chances is now before us. Some historian found two narratives, which made Tea wife, the one of Eremon, the other of G?ide. He might have deduced two " Teas," as a brother historian had deduced two " Scotas" out of a similar discrepancy. But he preferred to reject one of them; and as a date had somehow been fixed for G^ide which was later than the time of the first appearance of Temair on the stage, he had to reject the G&amp;de version. Hence in the " official history " Tea appears as the wife of Eremon, and Geide is ignored. True, on one of the lines of development of this history, the difficulty is surmounted by identifying Geide with Eremon j1 but the Keating-Four Masters tradition takes no notice of this way out of the difficulty. We cannot congratulate ourselves too heartily on the chance that the Geide version of the marriage of Tea was known to, and was simmering in the muddled brain of, the author of VD ii, when he was writing his " poem"; for it is nothing less than the " Open Sesame " to an understanding of the early history of Temair. Let us look, first, at the place which Geide holds in the " official " history. This document gives us a long roll of the kings of all Ireland, beginning with Slainge, first king of the Fir Bolg. We may note the accession-dates of this and the other monarchs with which we shall have to deal, merely as a con venient way of indicating into which pigeon-hole the historians fitted them. For this purpose the dates (Anno Mundi) in the Annals of the Four Masters 1 See Coir Anmann (in Irische Texte, iii, 324).</page><page sequence="75">Macalister?Temair Breg * Remains and Traditions of Tara. 305 will serve as well as any other, and will be used throughout. Slainge is said to have begun his reign in Anno Mundi 3266 (= B.C. 1933). The royal succession, as conceived of by the historians, is rarely one of immediate heredity. It is based on the theory of an eternal blood-feud, carried on through the centuries. Say there are three successive kings, X, Y, and Z. Y reigns after killing X, the latter having ascended the throne after killing some relation of Y, who had reigned previously ; and Y remains king until in his turn he is killed by Z, a relative of X. We have to return to the subject of this alleged blood-feud in a later section, so that we need not discuss it further at the moment. But we must note that in one place, in the course of the roll of kings, it is interrupted by a short intrusive dynasty, which runs as follows :? A.M. i. 3883 Eochu, surnamed Ollom Fodla, son of Fiachu Findscothach. ii. 3923 Elim, surnamed Finnachta, son of (i). iii. 3943 Slanoll, son of (i). iv. 3960 Geide Ollgothach, son of (i). v. 3972 Fiachu Findoilches, son of (ii). vi. 3992 Berngal, son of (iv). vii. 4004 Oilill,son of (iii). For convenience of reference we may call this the " Ulidian " dynasty. It is said to belong to the province of Ulaid; and indeed Lebor Gabdla gravely tells us that that province derived its name from Oll-flaith, " Big Prince," with reference to Eochu Ollom Fodla. This evidently means, though we are not told so in so many words, that Oll-flaith was a by-name or a nickname of the monarch in question. Otherwise there would have been no point in dragging the etymology in. We learn further from the same authority that Ollom Fodla was chosen by the men of Ireland to reign over them, for his wisdom. To him is ascribed the establishment of the periodical feis of Temair, and the building of the structure known as Mur nOlloman. His son and successor Elim derived his by-name Finnachta, explained as fin-shnechta, " wine-snow," from the remarkable fact that "snow with the taste of wine fell in his time." Sldnoll was so called (" sldn-oll, "healthy-great") because " everyone was healthy in his time/' We further learn that he himself was found dead in Temair of an unknown disease, " but the colour of his body changed not, neither did it decay, for forty years afterwards it was exhumed and found in perfect con dition."1 G&amp;de was called Oll-gothach, " Big-voiced," for the inadequate 1 Compare what we are told of the body of Cian&amp;n of Daimliag, in Feilire Oengusso, annotations, 24 November. [42*]</page><page sequence="76">806 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. reason that " everyone thought the voice of his fellow sweet as the strings of a lute, for the abundance of peace in his time." As ia description of a time of peace this is expressive enough, and when we read the same phrase in an account of the golden age of the reign of king Conaire1 we accept it with satisfaction. But when we find it given as an explanation of how a king came to be called " Big-voiced," it seems extremely foolish. It must have been a stock expression; and some wiseacre laid hold of it to account for a nickname which he was unable to understand. Of Fiachu we are told a number of interesting facts. Every calf born in his reign had a white head. He invented cistern-digging. He founded Cenannus,3 and for some reason nowhere stated, so far as I am aware, " Cenannus was the name of every place where he set his habitation." And such was the prosperity when he was king, " the stalk could scarce sustain its corn in his reign." Notwithstanding the close relationship of the kings of the Ulidian dynasty, the last four were slain by their successors, according to the usual rule. Let us now turn to the Pictish Chronicle? Prom this compilation we learn that Geide Ollgothach was a personage of considerably greater importance than the Irish historians would permit us to suppose. We are here told that Cruidne son of Cing, the eponym of the Picts, reigned for 100 years, and that he was succeeded by his seven sons in turn, who between them held the throne for 224 years. After them came " Gede Olgudach," who reigned, not the insignificant twelve years to which the Irish annalists limit him, but a space of no less than eighty years. Indeed this Gede, next to the eponymous Cruidne, is evidently regarded as the founder of the Pictish monarchy; for the seven sons of Cruidne are obviously late interpolations, dating from a time When the Pictish law of matrilinear succession had become obsolete. By this law a son could not succeed his father; and the seven are clearly nothing more than eponyms of different provinces of Scotland. We therefore delete the seven sons of Cruidne, and thus the obscure Geide 011-gothach is left to be head and founder of the Pictish monarchy.4 Eremon is the traditional head and founder of the Irish Celtic monarchy; it leases therefore to be surprising 1 B&amp;mie celtique, xxii, 27, #8. , ;[ .; : ;^' . * Kells, Co, Meath?the mensal lands of the kings of Temair, as we learn from a gloss printed in Todd Lect., xiii, 36. * Printed in Skene's Chronicles of the Ficts and Scots, pp. '4, 5. 4 In another list of Pictish kings, printed by Skene from a ms. in the Phillipps library (op. cit., 285), Gede, with a reign of 150 years to his credit, stands at the head of the dynasty, without any predecessors, eponymous or otherwise. This is, however, a different personage [?], who appears as Gilgidi in the Pictish Chronicle, after the thirty Brudes.</page><page sequence="77">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 307 that the legends should waver between G&amp;de and Eremon as the husband of Tea, the traditional foundress of Temair. In the Pictish Chronicle Geide is followed by Denbeean or Oenbecan, who reigns 100 years, and he by Olfinechta, who reigns eighty years. The latter looks like a compound of the names of Geide's two predecessors in the Ulidian list, [Slan]olland Finnachta. But there is a different version of the roll of early Pictish kings to be found in Rawl. B 506 (Bodleian Library) and in the Book of Lecan at p. 285.l This list follows closely the Ulidian dynasty; but it appears to duplicate the personality of Fiachu Findoilches. and while one of his "components " keeps the place before Berngal, the other takes the place of Slanoll, who is shifted to the place following G&amp;de. The names of the com ponents are Findoll Cisirne (before Geide) and Bagag" Ollfiacha (before Berngal). To the first are assigned the white cows, and it is easy to see the enigmatical by-name Findoilches buried in his name, as well as Fjacliu*s "cisterns." To the second is assigned the "beginning of wars in Ireland" which became so bad that in the time of his successor Berngal "all the corn in the country was destroyed except a sack and a half." The number of seven kings is preserved by the omission of Oilill. For reference we may set out the Pictish version of the Ulidian dynasty, as it appears in the Book of Lecan. thus:? Ollamh. hEilim Ollfinsnechta. Findoll Cisirne. Geithe Ollgothach. Slanoll. Bagag (Iribadach) Ollfiacha. Bearngal. All these kings are said to have reigned thirty years?a round number foe &amp; generation. Let us now compare with the Ulidian dynasty the list of kings, of the Fir Bolg, as it is contained in the " official history." This list stands as follows:*? A.M. ..;' i. 3267 Slainge, son of Dela. ii. 3268 Rudraige, son of Dela. 1 Printed in Skene, op. cit., p. 318. There is another copy of this listCin the Bpok of TJi Maine, fo. 15 a 1, line 32. 1 have collated this, but find no variant readings of importance, except that it calls Elim " Ollamh/' I have also collated the Lecan copy, Which displays slight orthographical variations from Skene's text: Skene follows Raw!., which I have not had an opportunity of examining. The Lecan version calls Elim "Ailill." 2 Inbadach in the Book of Ui Maine.</page><page sequence="78">308 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. iii. 3270 Gann and Genann, sons of Dela, in joint rule, iv. 3274 Sen-gann, son of Dela. v. 3279 Fiachu Cend-findan, son of Starn, son of (ii). vi. 3284 Einnal, son of Genann. vii. 3290 Foidbgen, son of (iv). viii. 3294 Eochu mac Eire, son of (vi). Except Fiachu, the names are all different.1 But we notice at once that Fiachu occupies the fifth place in each list, and (what is yet more suggestive) we are told the same tale about both these kings, that" the cows in their reign were white-headed." This leads to the inference that the two dynasties are essentially one, notwithstanding the incompatibility of the names. Com parison of the meagre genealogical and other particulars confirms us in this opinion. The first four names in each list are bound together by close ties (counting Gann and Genann, for the moment, as one). In the first list we have a father and three sons, in the second four (five) brothers. In each list the kings after the third met their death at the hands of their successors. The penultimate name in each list is that of a descendant of the fourth, and the ultimate that of a descendant of the third. That there are eight names in one list, seven in the other, need not trouble us seriously, for the Pictish list shows the possibility of one of the kings having a multiple personality. The name Eochu appears in both lists, but in different places. I suggest that there has been a contamination of tradition, and that Slainge occupies the place properly held by Eochu mac Eire?a name that seems to mean something like " divine horseman," or " horseman son of heaven" And it is not difficult to discover the source of the contamination which has produced this shift of names. The name Slainge can hardly be dissociated from the river Slainge, anglicized " Slaney." That Slainge was regarded as the leader of the Fir l?olg in their expedition to Ireland is only another way of saying that in some way the god of that river was responsible for their settlement in the country. .This would mean that there was at least a tradition that the first settlement had been macfe at or near the mouth of the river in question, and that the colonists had penetrated up its valley into the interior of the country. ' Now the Milesians were said to have been led to the settlement of Ireland by a certain Donn, though his untimely death prevented him from actually enjoying sovereignty in the country. A very ancient way of referring respect 1 Though Rinual and Beragal have sufficient resemblance to suggest that the one may be a corruption of the other, or both corruptions of some third form.</page><page sequence="79">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 309 fully to divine or sacred personages is to prefix the possessive pronoun mo to their names. Donn, thus referred to, would be called Mo-Donn. When we turn .to the Geography of Ptolemy, we find that he knew the Slaney under the name Modonnos: from which we infer that there was also a Milesian tradition that the god of this river led the invaders. It is unlikely that both the aborigines and the Celtic invaders should have ascribed their conquests to the same leader. That is to say, one or other version is the original story, the alternative story being imitated from it. On a later page of this paper I hope to set forth some other, quite independent, reasons for believing that it was the Celtic incomers who landed at the Slaney estuary. It follows, then, that the Fir Bolg story is merely a corruption, the Slaney being put at the head of the Fir Bolg list because the same river, under another name, occupies a corresponding position in the Milesian list. Slainge is therefore to be expunged, and it may well be that Eochu mac Eire should replace him. This would bring the two lists into yet closer correspondence. But, even without any such manipulation, the links are strong enough to bind the lists together. Notwithstanding the difference of names, we have before us two different versions of the story of one dynasty. The difference of names, at first sight difficult to account for, is really a very simple matter. Personal names are the most fluid of all folk-lore elements, and one and the same story told throughout a country will be fitted to a John in one shire, to a James in another, and to a Thomas in a third. The story of the dynasty before us was enshrined in a folk-tale. Different narrators in different parts of the country, while preserving the incidents, were troubled with lapses of memory where the names were concerned. The tales were then collected by the investigators (if we may so call them) on whose work the "official history" was based. Unfortunately those dreary people had no interest in anything but the skeleton of history?the names and the dates. They extracted these from the tales before them, not troubling to notice that the different versions of the history were not independent of one another.1 The suggestion may further be made that the folk-tale was a popular version of a lost epic. Such a composition, being written in the obscure archaic language of the druidic poems, would in its literary form be the exclusive property of the men of learning; only its general contents would be known to the people at large. . \ .'..:..._, ... \ . -1 it is only fair to add/that ikey-were very probably influenced by their desire to maintain Christian faith and morals unalloyed. It is quite possible that the folk-tale was offensive from this point of view^ and that the only " safe "parts of it were the names and dates. The curious details about Slanoll's burial were perhaps in the original story; the other recorded "facts" are clearly etymological adaptations.</page><page sequence="80">310 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. There is yet a third list of kings which seems to bo based upon the same foundation. This is the dynasty of the Tuatha De Danann. - It consists of seven entries, to which an eighth is added by way of appendix in Lebor Gdbdla. They run as follows :? * A.M. i. 3304 Bresson of Elada. ii. 3311 Nuada Airgetl&amp;m son of Eochu mac Eire. iii. 3331 Lug Lamfhada fostered by Tailltiu daughter of Eochu mac Eire, iv. 3371 Eochu Oll-athair, surnamed In Dagdae, son of Elada. v. 3451 Delbaeth son of Ogma. vi. 3460 Fiachu son of (v). vii. 3471 Three kings, variously named, in joint rule, viii. (did not reign) Manannan mac Lir. This list begins with a " son of learning," just _ as the Ulidian list begins with the "sage of Fodla." The connexion of the next two with Eochu mac Eire is inconsistent with the latter being one of the rival Fir Bolg; we have here a further suggestion of an original form of a tradition in which the " heavenly horseman " stood at the head of a genealogy. Eochu Oll-athair, again, is closely cognate in form and meaning with Eochu Oil-flaith; we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the two names refer to the same personage. In Dagdae is not a name, but an appellation, as we gather from its always having the definite article prefixed. Gei-de, the name which started us on this line of investigation, is of similar formation, and holds a corresponding place in the Ulidian list. The element QM- occurs again in the name of the Geidumni, an obscure Gaulish tribe mentioned by Caesar. This name is interpreted as meaning "stormy, impetuous " ;l if this etymology be sound, we must have in Geide 011-gothach literally a "Big-voiced Storm-god." The other links connecting the Tuatha De Danann dynasty with the Ultonian dynasty are fewer in number than are those which we have traced between the Ultonian and the Fir Bolg lists; but they are not weaker. Fiachu reappears, though not exactly in the same place, and, apparently, without any legend about white cattle attaching to him. Delbaeth recalls the Denbecan or Oenbecan of the first Pictish list?perhaps these two forms are scribal errors for the first. . ..:..' Fiachu himself had some connexion with Temair. According to VD i it was in the days of Fiachu Cendfindan that Liath son of Laigne Lethan 1 See Holder's Altceltischer Sprachschatz, sub voce,</page><page sequence="81">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 311 glas cut down the hazel-thicket of Temair; and we may now turn aside to follow up this thread in the tangle. The name Fiachu occurs several times in the roll of the kings of Ireland. Besides the two of whom we have already heard, we find the following in the more legendary period :? A.M. i. 3728 Fiachu Labruinne father of Oengus Oll-mucach. ii. 3848 Fiachu Find-scothach, father of Eochu Ollom Fodla. iii. 4395 Fiachu Tolgrach. iv. (did not reign) Fiachu Fer- mara, son of Oengus Tuirmech Temrach. v. a.d. 56 Fiachu Find-iblach. Of these, Fiachu Tolgrach seems to be independent of the rest, and need not again be referred to. Fiachu Find-iolach and his successor Elim are evidently borrowed from the Ulidian dynasty as padding, inserted before the doubtless historical king Tuathal Techtmar. Coir Anmann1 tells the same story of his connexion with white cattle, which is enough to settle his identity with the other kings of the same name. Fiachu Find-scothach, father of Ollom Fodla, is a doublet of Elim Finnachta, son of Ollom Fodla; for the same peculiar story is told of him?that snow (in his case flowers) with the taste of wine appeared in his reign. This is important, as it shows that doublets can reverse their genealogical connexions; that is to say, if we have pairs of doublets, A, A', and B, B', we may find in one story that A is a son of B, though in the other story A' may be the father of B'. The point of this observation appears when we consider the two remaining names of the list. Fiachu Labrainne is the father of an Oengus ; Fiachu Fer-mara is the son of another Oengus, who is called by the suggestive name Tuirmech Temrach, which seems to mean " the reckoner" or "the apportioner " of Temair?a fitting name for someone who had to do with the foundation of a sanctuary* We are reminded of the name given in VD iii 123 to the holy well called Caprach Cormaic?Topur Tuirme Cland, "the well of numbering of clans"; and we must not forget that this well also bore the name of Tipra Bo Finde, "the well of the white cow,'* which recalls to our minds the peculiarity of the cows in the reign of Fiachu. Of Fiachu Fer-mara we are told that he was begotten by his father Oengus on his own daughter, when drunken; and that Oengus was so much ashamed of what he had done that he put the infant adrift on the sea, with a purple royal robe and a gold pin upon him. The child was rescued by fishermen, who gave him the name Fer-mara, "man of the sea," in com 1 Irische Texte, iii, 332. B.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C. [48]</page><page sequence="82">312 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. memoration of the event. An almost identical tale is told of Cummine Fota in the glosses to Feilire Oengusso1; showing that (as is so often the case) the explanation offered for the name is not a mere etymological invention, but an adaptation of a fragment of folk-lore previously existing. This is the reason why the " explanations " are almost always so pitifully inadequate! 'The name Fer-mara is clearly theophorous, meaning " Man of the sea (-god)," just as Fer-Loga means " Man of (the god) Lug." But how did such a story of a father-and-daughter union come to be told? It is not a solitary case; another instance is the case of Oengus Nic (another Oengus!), son of the Leinster king Cathaeir Mor by his daughter Muchna.2 In fact we read several times of such occurrences, always explained by intoxication. This explanation is probably an attempt on the part of a Christian historian, with a recollection of the story of Lot and his daughters in his mind,3 to tone down an offensive incident. But the true explanation of this type of tale is very different. In an exogamous society founded on mother-right, the father and the daughter belong to separate clans, and marriage between them is not necessarily a thing forbidden. Unless the tribe has evolved the complex organization of the Australian aborigines, in which by a further subdivision of the clans into exogamous phratries and totem-groups such unions are excluded automatically, there is nothing to prevent them. In the original version of this and similar tales the union of father and daughter was most likely treated as a matter of course, to the very natural scandal of their Christian editors. There is no use trying to worry out ingenious evasions of the evidence that marriages in early Britain and Ireland were regulated by laws very different from those now in force. Much indignation has been aroused by Caesar's assertion that the British tribes practised a form of polyandry in which the husbands were father and sons.4 Even if it were a libel, it might surely be taken with philosophic calm after two thousand years ; but it is not a libel?it has not apparently been noticed that we have the record of just such a menage in the Lismore Life of St. Ciardn? which introduces us to one Donnan, brother's son of Senan, who had the same mother as Sendn. The other Oengus, son of Fiachu Labruinne, is known by the surname Ollmucach, "great quencher"?not an unnatural name to give a warrior. It reminds us not a little of the surname Oll-gothach given to Geide. It is 1 Bradshaw Edition, pp. 242, 243. 2 Tiomna Chathaeir Mhoir in Leabhar na gCeart, ed. O'Donovan, pp. 198, 199. 3 Genesis xix. 30-38. 4 De Bello Gallico V, xiv. 5 Lismore Lives, ed. Stokes, line 4362.</page><page sequence="83">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 31&amp; tempting to treat 011-mucach as a variation of Oil-gothach, derived from a misreading of a note written in Ogham. As will be found by experiment, the scores by which these two words would be so denoted are almost identical. But the temptation must be suppressed. The names would not be written in Ogham characters in their modern orthography, with lenition expressed by means of //, except as &amp;jeu d esprit; and this would not happen till after they had both established a separate existence in literature. The foregoing arguments give us the following equation:? Geide Oll-gothach = Eochu Oll-athair = In Dagdae = Sen-gann ?and this leads to the further conclusion that the appellation In Dagdae is a euphemism, " the good god " instead of " the storm god." But why, it will be asked, is this Celtic storm-god claimed as the head and founder of the Pictish monarchy ? The answer to this question must be, that we have here a variety of syncretism in which the new gods are not added to the old pantheon, but are identified with them individually?just such a syncretism as we see existing in literature between the gods of Greece and of Rome, where Iuppiter and Zeus, Minerva and Athene, Diana and Artemis, are treated as identical personalities. The incoming Celts have identified their storm-god with some god or deified man, who was supposed to have founded the kingdom of the aboriginal Picts, In that case, someone will object, the name of Geide ought to have come first in the dynasty which we have isolated. Instead of this it occupies the fourth place. This difficulty arises however we are to interpret the docu ments ; but an explanation is not hard to find. It is this?Geide, or rather the person whose place in the original tradition Geide holds, was the first human king in the list. The three names which precede his are the names of gods. If the hypothesis on which we are working is as correct as it seems reasonable?that the dynastic lists before us are extracted from the several versions of a folk-story, which was itself a popular paraphrase of an epic?it follows that the epic narrated a history which began in Olympus, and half way through descended to a newly-fashioned earth. It was, in other words, an epic of cosmogony. Of this view the Fir Bolg list affords some confirmation. The names of the two personages in joint rule, Gann and Genann, are clearly variants of one another. In fact, they belong to a triplicity of which the third member is their successor Sen- Gann, " Old Gann/' Now, why does not " Old Gann "reign before his presumably younger colleagues ? Doubtless because he is " old '&gt; from a different point of view. He is the " Old Gann " of the earth-dwellers; probably he is conceived of as a sort of heaven-descended mortal creator, [43*]</page><page sequence="84">314 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. exactly like the Unkulunkulu, the " old old one " of the Zulus.1 Sen-gann is, in short, the last god and the first man of the cosmogonic epic ; and it is thus quite natural that he should have become identified with the founder of their human monarchy of Temair, while retaining sufficient divinity to make it possible for him to be a storm-god. But another objection may now be raised. We have already suggested the equation of Eochu Oll-athair with Eochu Oll-Ilaith, who holds a different place in the Ulidian dynasty. To Eochu OU-Haith is ascribed the institu tion of the feis of Temair, and therefore the personage so called, who stands first (not fourth) in the Ulidian list, must be regarded as the head of the established monarchy. How can this be reconciled with the ascription of the same function to Geide, the fourth in the same list ? Only on the hypothesis that Geide and Eochu were originally one, and originally held the fourth place in the list. Some uncomprehending historian, who could not understand the fortes ante Agamemnona, has transferred to Ollom Fodla, the divine source of all knowledge and wisdom, the head of the god-kings, the actions which really belong to Geide, or whatever name we call the fourth personage, the connect ing link between gods and men, the head of the man-kings. This is the more easy to understand when we see reason afforded us by the Tuatha list to believe that both these personages were called Eochu. The Tuatha list therefore comes nearest to the original form. The Ulidian list, which has divorced the foundation of Temair from the fourth king, represents a corruption; and the Fir Bolg list, which has displaced the divine Eochu in favour of the river-god Slainge, under the influence of a different story, shows a further contamination. This theory, of a popular tale based upon an ancient epic, derives support from an exact parallel which I am able to quote. In the Hebrew Scriptures there is to be found a sublime philosophical poem, based upon a slight thread of incident; I refer to the Book of Job. Whether the author of this poem invented the story, or whether he adapted a folk-tale previously existing, cannot be determined with certainty ; the latter is the more probable. But I was able to recover from an illiterate Arab of Southern Palestine a folk-tale, certainly based upon the poem. All the philosophy was, of course, excised, and the tale was told as a child might tell it?with the importation of extraneous elements, derived from the common stock of folk-belief. The relation between the poem and my folk-tale is identical with the relation which I 1 Or like Adna, son of Bith, " Ancient, son of Cosmos," who, according to a tradition preserved by Keating, was the first visitor to Ireland after the deluge (Keating's History, I.T.S. ed., i, p. 154).</page><page sequence="85">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 315 here presume to exist between the epic and the stories on which the " official historians" founded their catalogues of kings.1 The Ogham inscriptions teach us that even proper names appeared in the epic language in a form quite different from their form in current speech?far greater is the difference, indeed, than that between the way in which Homer pronounced the names of his heroes, and the barbarous way in which English schoolboys are taught to pronounce them, though that is saying much?so that it is not surprising that the popular narrators gradually substituted for these unfamiliar forms names with which they were better acquainted. So, in the story of Job and similar modern Arab versions of Hebrew narratives, all extra-biblical personages introduced are fitted with familiar Arabic names. We have seen that the Tuatha list comes nearest to the original form. The Ulidian and the Fir Bolg lists are closer to one another (e.g. in the relationships alleged to exist between the kings), but farther from the original form. I take it that the Ulidian version is not derived from the Tuatha version, but represents an independent line of tradition, and that the Fir Bolg version is a derivative from the Ulidian; probably developed in south-east Leinster, owing to the prominence given to the deity of the Slaney river. We can now, I think, make some way towards reconstructing a skeleton of the original epic. The number of names in the lists oscillates between seven and eight. On the whole, the probability is in favour of seven as being the original number. It is the number of Tuatha kings, and it is also the number of Fir Bolg kings when we displace Slainge and restore Eochu mac Eire to his proper place at the head; In the Tuatha list the first three kings are well-known gods?Bres, Nuadu, Lug. The fourth is also a god. The other three, Delbaeth, Fiachu, and the triplicity with which the list ends, are not gods-^-at least, there is nothing about them which we can point to as divine. It is a mistake to suppose that the Tuatha De Danann are a pantheon of gods pure and simple; the mere fact that we are told of the gods which they worshipped?Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba?shows that this easy solution of the Tuatha problem is only partially successful. And the final triplicity of kings are so far human, that almost the only thing that we are told about them is the nature of the gods 1 A translation of the version which I learnt will be found in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, 1908^ p. 315. It is instructive to notice that another version of the story, so different as to be an almost independent paraphrase, will be found in the Rev. J. R. Hanauer's Folk-lore of the Holy Land, p. 17. This, as illustrating the different versions of the " epic " tale, makes the parallel even more illuminating. In Dr. Walter Leafs Homer and History other parallels will be found, in chapter viii, headed 44 The Achaian Epos."</page><page sequence="86">316 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. which they worshipped?one the hazel, the second the sun, and the third the ploughshare. If this means anything, it implies rather that they were culture-heroes, who taught certain forms of religion to their people. The connexion of Fiachu with cattle is also suggestive of a pastoral culture-hero. The Fir Bolg and the Tuatha lists both end in a catastrophe called the Battle of Mag Tuired. Our historians, taking these records as literal history about literal persons and places, sought and found a different site for each battle. This is, of course, only late euhemerism, acquiring plausibility from the existence of megalithic monuments on the sites chosen. Or, perhaps preferably, we are to see here a false identification. The epic narrative ended in a tale of disaster. There were current, independently of the epic, stories of great battles in the places called Mag Tuired, suggested by the megalithic remains. The epic disaster became popularly associated with these battles. We do not find any such definite story of catastrophe in the Ulidian narrative, though in its Pictish version there is more than a hint of it, in the battles which destroyed the crops in the reign of the last king. To sum up, an epic in four books is adumbrated :? Book I: The Story of the Gods. i. Divine Wisdom {OUom Fodla, Mac Elathan) impersonate in a mighty (bres) divine horseman (Eochu mac Eire). Perhaps we should rather say a divine horse-man; the deity may have been hippomorphic, or hippanthropo morphic. ii. Nuadu. iii. Lug. These are the more ordinary names of the gods, who appear under other names in the other lists. It is noteworthy that although others of the Tuatha De Danann were certainly gods (such as Ogma, Dian Cecht, etc.), yet they have no place among the "kings." This fact is suggestive, as indicating artificial selection and manipulation. Book II: The Story of a Creating Demi-god. iv. Eochu (a different being from E. mac Eire), a storm deity (Geide), but also a " good god " (Dagdae). He is closely akin to the three preceding, as the genealogies in the Fir Bolg and Ulidian lists show, but on a lower plane. He is killed by his successor in the kingdom?the meaning of this custom, and the special significance of its beginning at this stage in the narrative, will appear in the fallowing section. He descends to earth, and is the "Old Gann " of the earth-dwellers; and is a great prince (Oll-flaith) and universal Father [Oll-athair). We may further suggest that this epic married Tea to the creating demi-god, and that the latter, after his death, became lord among the dead. This would account for Caesar's story that the Gauls reckoned their</page><page sequence="87">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 317 descent from Dis Pater1; it would also bring the Tea story yet further into line with the model of the myth of Kore. Book III: The Story of the Heroes. v, vi, vii. Three heroes, or groups of heroes, who teach the several arts of life and religion to the people. They are variously named, except Fiachu, who appears in all the lists. We may very fairly note the curious coincidence that the Tuatha list ends with three culture heroes, as does the ancient Hebrew tradition, which after the story of Creation gives Us a genealogy, culminating in three culture-heroes, Jubal, Jabal, and Tubal. BOOK IV: The Story of the Final Catastrophe. Possibly a flood-legend: the tale of Cesair is certainly a native flood legend, synchronized by the historians with the flood of Noah. A reminiscence of a flood-story may have become incorporated with a wholly different saga, that of the fight between the sons of Nemed and the Fomoraig, when the combatants were drowned by the rising tide which, in the heat of battle, they did not perceive. It is also suggested by the frequent legends of lake bursts. But on the whole it is more probable that the Final Catastrophe took the form of an annihilating war, as in Volo-spd. Indeed, that glorious poem is not unlike the epic which we are reconstructing, and may even be based upon it. The Druidic name or equivalent for the Teutonic Ragna-rok, the Doom of the Gods, appears to have been Erdathe,2 a mysterious word still awaiting explanation. It is evident that such a symmetrical arrangement as this?three gods, a demigod, and then three heroes?must be due to conscious literary manipu lation on the part of some individual author. Moreover, such an author must have had a mind stored with ideas of religion above the common folk lore ; no ordinary man would have begun his scheme of creation with the abstract conception of Divine Wisdom, even though he impersonated it in the crude form of a horse-god. This might be taken as an objection to the theory here set forward; but it need not necessarily be so. We are only beginning to realize how much movement there was between peoples and tribes even so far back as the European Bronze Age. I see no extravagance in imagining a medicine-man of Central Europe fired with a longing for wisdom, and seeking it even so far away as the Vedic schools of India. Such a man, returning to his own people, and trying to systematize their crude beliefs on the basis of 1 De Bello Gitilico, vi, xviii. 1. If those are correct who would see the Gaulish Dis Pater in Cernunnos, the presence of Cernunnos shrines on the hill of Tea would become yet more suggestive. 2Tirechan, in Vit. Trip. Pat., vol. ii, p. 308.</page><page sequence="88">318 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the modicum of philosophy which he has thus acquired, would produce a literary composition not unlike that outlined above.1 But we have not yet finished with these lists and their syncretisms. One of the commonest ways of identifying gods together is by affiliation, making the one the son of the other. To In Dagdae was affiliated in this way one of the greatest of the gods of Pagan Ireland, Oengus in Broga. Constant tradition associated Oengus in Broga with the colossal monument now called New Grange, the chief sepulchre of the Boyne valley. And there is every reason to suppose that tradition is here correct. The very existence of the mound proves the historicity of the owner, just as absolutely as any of the Egyptian pyramids would prove the existence of the king who built it, even if no other record of him survived. The tomb must have been a sanctuary almost from the first, &amp;nd the deification of Oengus established and fixed his name in tradition, just as the names of river-gods have been fixed in tradition. We find Oengus worshipped in Ireland down to the seventh century A.D.; in Bet ha Colmdin maic Luachdin2 we read that the jester3 of king Cinaed put his horse under the protection of Oengus, while his Christian master put his horse under the protection of St. Colman, with the natural result that the heathen's horse was stolen, while the king's remained safe? another of the stories used as ammunition in the war of creeds. Now there is another tradition as to the parentage of Oengus which has never been explained, enshrined in his full name Oengus mace in Oc, " Oengus son of the Two Youths." A first clue as to the meaning of this name is afforded us by the Fir Bolg list. The name there corresponding to In Dagdae (= Oengus) is Sen-gann, " Old Gann "; this name is immediately preceded by two other Ganns, differentiated slightly as Gann and Genann, who may be tentatively described as the two " Young Ganns," by contrast.4 But we may pursue this road still farther, and find at the end a striking confirmation of the views put forward in the foregoing pages, as well as a welcome glimpse into the early traditions on which the epic was based. In Dr. Eendel Harris's suggestive series of volumes on the Dioscuri, especially 1 Since writing the above words I have re-read, for a different purpose, M. Salomon Reinach's famous essay La mirage orientate. Under its influence I am inclined to wonder whether it is necessary to send our epic-writer to India?whether, indeed, the inspiration did not travel in a contrary direction 1 But into the mazes of speculation which such a question would open up I dare not venture, and I allow the text to sjand as originally written. 2 Todd Lectures edition, p. 87. 3 Doubtless meaning druid : the Christian historians were not above taking advantage of the similarity between the words druth and drui. 4 In passing we may note a tradition that made Gann and Genann two Fomorian leaders: see Keating's History (ed. I.T.S. i, p. 178).</page><page sequence="89">Macalister?Temair Breg r Remains and Traditions of Tara. 319 in that entitled Boanerges, it is established that in primitive Aryan belief, and also in other primitive systems of belief that in our present knowledge we must consider remote from Aryan, thunder is regarded as being produced by a bird, which is usually the woodpecker. This thunder-bird in time becomes a thunder-god, the ornithomorph developing with advancing civilization into an anthropomorph?though the bird is not often wholly forgotten. The thunder god becomes the parent of one or both of a pair of twins?Castor and Pollux is the best known of a long series of such pairs, of which Dr. Harris has collected the particulars. These twins are habitually clothed in red, or by some other association with the colour red betray the secret of their fiery origin. Dr. Harris has been able to bring forward quite a striking number of examples of this sequence. The Fir Bolg list gives us a new example of the same sequence, in the reverse order. It is one more indication that Slainge is to be treated as an interpolation, that the sequence begins with and explains the otherwise obscure name Rudraige, where we see a recollection of the red of the twins' robes (ruad = "red"). Next come the twins themselves, Gann and Genann, with assonantal names, as is usual. Then comes the parent of the twins, Sen-gann, whom we have on quite independent grounds already identified with the thunder-god. We next come to Fiachu. It is impossible that the name Fiachu (&lt; * veikos) should represent Picus directly, nor does Fiachu mean u woodpecker." In fact, I can find no Celtic word for the woodpecker cognate with picus. But fiach means "raven"; and this suggests that the myth embodying the {woodpecker?thunder-god?twins?red colour} sequence is not Celtic tradition, of native growth, but imported from with out ; and that for the unfamiliar name of the woodpecker the name of another bird resembling it in sound has been substituted, in the course of the transference. Be that as it may, we have the thunder-god associated with a raven on the well-known Sarrebourg altar.1 This monument represents a god with his attendant goddess, called respectively, in the associated inscription, Sucellos and Nantosvelta. Beneath their figures is the bas-relief of a raven. That Sucellos is a thunder-god is indicated by the great mallet which he is carrying.2 1 See Reinach, Cultes, Mythes, et Religions, i, p. 217 ff. 2 The well-known and curious passage in Pseudo-Plutarch (which M. Reinach duly quotes), informing us that " Longos is the Celtic for a raven," is probably an ignorant confusion between (a) the sun-god, (b) the thunder-god, and (c) the ornithomorphic representation of the latter. It is no more worthy of credence than the stories which well-meaning but ill-informed journalists have recently been setting before us, regarding the significance attached by the Syrians to the name of General Allenby. The worst Arabic ever written has appeared in some of these ingenuous concoctions. R.I.A, PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. Ct [44]</page><page sequence="90">320 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The reversal of the sequence in the story before us cannot be explained except on the theory of literary craftsmanship. Once more we trace the hand of the unknown Celtic Hesiod, who wove his Theogonia out of previously existing materials. For the connexion of the woodpecker with pastoral pursuits (as Fiachu is associated with cattle) it will suffice to refer the reader to the numerous examples collected by Dr. Harris, especially in his thirty seventh chapter. Perhaps it is too much to see in a following king, Foidbgen, said to have derived his name from the fact that "knots" (fuidb) first appeared in trees in his time, for before his time the trees were smooth, a reminiscence of the more ordinary activities of the woodpecker. Reversals of like nature are not unknown in the literary manipulation of folk-lore. For, as Dr. Harris has shown, in many of the cases where Ovid in his Metamorphoses speaks of a man or woman having been transformed into a tree, or a bird, or what-not, he is re-telling a savage legend in which a phyllomorph or a theriomorph has been turned into an anthropomorph ; that is, he is reversing the actual sequence of events in the original tale. In consequence of this reversal, it follows that Oengus, or, rather, the being to whom Oengus was equated, was not originally son of the two youths, but father of the two youths ; and he thus falls into line with other storm-gods as the parent of Dioscuri. Oengus himself, we may feel confident, was primarily a historical character. He appears under several disguises in the roll of kings. Oll-mucach, " great quencher," is a good name for the despot who caused the huge monument on the Boyne to be built in his honour. Tuirmech Temrach is another of his avatars. This name the " official historians " explain by one of their usual fatuities; but it would be quite suitable for the personage who established the sanctuary on the ridge on which there is a sacred well bearing a similar name. We now gather together the threads which we have endeavoured to disentangle, and set before the reader an attempt to trace the chronological development of the myth. The raw materials were as follows:? Among the Puk-Celts (In Ireland) 1. The sanctuary of Temair. 2. The tradition of Oengus or Un gust, a great monarch, who had estab lished the sanctuary, and who was Among the Celts (On the Continent) 1. The woodpecker myth. 2. The story of Scota and Tea (a version of the Demeter and Kore for mula).</page><page sequence="91">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 321 buried (and worshipped) at New Grange. N.B.?The traditions re garding Oengus were coloured by the matriarchal organization of pre Celtic society. 3. Certain gods, including Etherun, and a triplicity or quaternity among which was Feron. 3. Certain gods. 4. Certain cosmogonic myths. The steps in the development were as follows :? 1. An epic was composed, at some unknown time before the arrival of the Celts in Ireland, based upon the Celtic material set forth above. 2. This epic was taught as a text-book in thedruidie schools, and garbled paraphrases of it became current in the form of folk-stories. 3. The Celts landed in Ireland about 400 B.C.?at the beginning of the Iron Age in the country?at the mouth of the Slaney, and adopted the god of that river as their leader in the invasion. It is likely that the prime purpose of the invasion was to acquire a mastery of the Wicklow gold-fields, so that it was natural that the invasion should attack the country at the south-east, where a large river offered a water-way through that part of the island. 4. They asserted a claim to the country by affiliating or otherwise identifying their gods with the gods of the aborigines. The chief identifica tions were that of the demi-god of their epic with the pre-Celtic Ungust or Oengus; and the affiliation of Scota to Feron.1 5. The story of the abduction of Tephi (originally of Tea) was afterwards adapted as a reason for their coming to the country. This story is told in two versions?either as an abduction, as we find it in VD, or as the murder of Ith, that is of "corn." There is not a very serious difference between the abduction of the corn-spirit and the murder of corn, so that the two stories may well have been more similar to one another than might have been expected at first sight. As we have not got the full tale of the abduction of Tea, it is impossible to compare them. 6. After the establishment (i) of the suzerainty of Temair over most of Ireland and (ii) of Christianity, the native scholars turned their attention to the collecting and systematizing of the historical traditions current in the country. Having fixed a framework of chronology on the basis of Scriptural 1 In Leaf's Homer and History, chap, vii, a remarkable parallel to this process of affiliation is described : the absorption of the Pelasgian corn-spirits and similar beings, by the pantheon of the intruding Achaeans. [44*]</page><page sequence="92">322 Proceedings /&gt;f the Royal Irish Academy. and Classical synchronisms, they fitted their materials thereto artificially. These materials were threefold, namely, A. Folk-lore collected from oral tradition, B. Folk-lore written down at an earlier time,. C. Historical record written down at an earlier time, ?the earlier writings being in the obscure archaic language mentioned on a previous page, which the historians probably knew very imperfectly. Of class A we have a good example in the dynasty-record that we have in this chapter been analysing; the last relic of the ancient cosmogonic epic. Of class B we have an illustration in such romances as Tain Bo Cualnge, which in their present literary form preserve the record of modes of life older than the time when they were written down. Of the preservation of early historical record, class C, I can give no better example than the list of chieftains of the district now known as the Decies of Waterford, whose historicity is attested by their Ogham-written monuments, but who are woven into the roll of the kings of Temair.1 The historians believed that Temair had always held the central place that it enjoyed in Irish politics in their own time, and they framed their history in this belief ; thus they supposed that the numerous names of kings which they found in their authorities were all High Kings of Ireland. In point of fact, some of them were gods, others mere creations of folk-lore, others actual human chieftains who had reigned in one part or another in Ireland. Many of them were duplicates derived from different authorities, but really referring to the same historical or legendary character. The theory of the central position of Temair was pushed back into the pre-Celtic period, so that pre-Celtic rulers of Temair also became rulers of Ireland. Thus Ungust, originally the local hero of the Boyne valley, equated to the storm-god Gdide, and he in his turn "humanized" into a hero, became the founder of the whole Pictish monarchy.2 In a word, the almost casual mention of the obscure G&amp;de of the Great Voice as husband of Tea has led us by these devious ways to the conclusion that the traditional founder of Temair, and the personage in whose honour the great mound of New Grange was erected, were one and the same. 1 I called attention to the remarkable correspondences between these Ogham records and one group of the Temair kings in 1908 (Journ. Roy. Soc. of Ant. of Ireland, xxxviii, 1). The paper referred to contains a number of mistakes, now obvious to no one more than to myself ; but the actuality of these correspondences still holds in most, though not in all, of the cases brought forward. 2 He appears in his own form later in the list of Pictish kings ; for " Gest Cuirte," Gest of the Court, is obviously merely a corruption of " Ungust of the Brug " or palace.</page><page sequence="93">Macalister? Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 323 It was suggested on a previous page that the name Scota had possibly been modified artificially in the interests of the etymology of the ethnic name Scuit. We may for a moment return to this subject. With all reserve I suggest that the name of the ancestress was originally Scathach, and that she is none other than the amazon instructress of Cu-Chulaind. The following analogies seem to be worth pointing out:? Sc&amp;thach is called " Scathach Buanann daughter of Ardgeimm king of Scythia " in a passage which will be found printed in Eriu iv 30.1 Now Buanann, according to an entry in Cormac's Glossary, was an important mother-goddess; Ana, he says, was mother of the gods, and Buanann of the heroes. This just fits in with what Scota is said to have been?the eponym of the Scotic tribes. Again, daughter of Ard-geimm and wife of Oil-gothack are closely analogous expressions. (It will be remembered that we have indicated some reason for thinking that Tea and Tephi have been confused and interchanged in the corrupt version of their story, which is all that we have of it.) And finally king of Scythia and Pharaoh king of Egypt are not far removed from one another in Irish tradition. In another passage we have a different version of Sc&amp;thach's parentage.3 She is there called ingen Biianuinne, rig na Scithia, "daughter of Buanainn king of Scythia." Now we remember that Scota was daughter of Forann; that Forann seems to be an adaptation of Feronn; and that in another list Ainnind occupies the place of Feronn. Ainnind looks like a corruption of [Bu]anainn. The syncretistic affiliation of the incoming mother-goddess to an aboriginal Pictish deity would almost inevitably result in the home of the goddess becoming localized in Pictland. This is what we find in the case of Scathach; she is always conceived of as living in the North. There seems to be a reminiscence of the same order of ideas, and also of the " epic " dynasty, in the personage called Senoll mac Ongai, to whom Brian, the brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages, was sent in the north of Alba, to learn the art of war.* 4.?The Kingship of Temair. We have already seen that, previously to the conquests of Cormac macAirt, Temair was of much greater importance as a religious sanctuary than as a political centre; and we must now consider the religious rites of which the Ridge was the scene. The first question which meets us will be the nature of the kingship of Temair. i I am indebted to Dr. Bergin for directing my attention to this passage, but he has no responsibility for the use that I am making of it. 2 Bevue celtique, xxix, 114. 3 Bevue celtique, xxiv, 177.</page><page sequence="94">324 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The king of Temair was a god incarnate on earth. This is the all-important fact which results from the study of the traditions of the early kingship that have come down to us, confused and misunderstood though these certainly are by the ancient historians who have recorded them. When a good king was on the throne, the gods condescended to take up their abode within him; when the king was illegitimate, they withdrew themselves. In the former case the crops were plentiful; in the latter case there was misery and famine. Contrast these two characterizations, from Lebor Gabdla? Good was that king Eochu mac Eire; there was no rain in his time, but only dew ; there was no year with out its harvest, falsehood was expelled from Ireland in his time. In evil case was Ireland in the time of that Coirpre, for the earth did not yield her fruit, because there was but one grain in the ear, one acorn on the oak, one nut on the hazel; the creeks were unproductive, the cattle were dry, so that there was an intoler able famine throughout Ireland for the fiYe years in which Coirpre was king. We have seen in the last section that Eochu mac Eire was the gieat impersonation of Divine Wisdom, at the head of the " epic " pantheon; and though the historians have made him into a king, he retains sufficient godhead to secure the blessings named for his people. Coirpre, on the other hand, surnamed Cenn-Chait, was the leader of the revolt of the serfs, that is, of the enslaved aborigines. He was alien in race, religion,1 and probably in speech, from the ruling classes. Naturally the gods would not condescend to take up their abode in a creature so despicable, and naturally the country suffered from their absence. The same idea appears elsewhere in Celtdom. Livy has a reference to it in his priceless abstract of the saga of king Ambigatus.2 As Dr. Baudis points out, this idea is also at the basis of the prohibition of the rule of a blemished king.3 Evidently a chief function of the king was to offer his body as a receptacle for the divinity whose presence secured the boon of plentiful harvests; and the body must be worthy of its divine 1 Coir Anmand, a tract which tries to do for biography what Dindshenchas Erenn does for geography, accounts for Coirpre's nickname '*cat-head" in a singular way. It says. fuath cait robhai fora dea, "his god had the shape of a cat.' Obviously this does not explain why a person should be called " cat-headed." We must therefore see once more an adaptation to etymological needs of a sentence already in existence. It is not difficult to see in it a contemptuous reference to some form of animal worship among the aborigines, an early manifestation of odium thedogicum, this time between the creeds of rival pagan races in the country. 2 Livy, v, 34. 3 This rule was not universal: from the story of Aithirne we learn that the Connacian king Guaire had but one eye, which did not interfere with his reigniug.</page><page sequence="95">Maca lister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 325 occupant. A Christianized version of the divinity of the king appears in the story of the Battle of Mag Mucrime,1 in which angels hovered over the head of king Art in the battle, " because he was a true prince." It is extremely important to notice indications that, in the case of the king of Temair, the marriage of the king was essential to secure the boon which he was supposed to bring his people. This is probably the reason why the nobles of firiu refused to countenance the unwedded king Eochu Aireni and boycotted his assembly ;2 and in the story edited by* Mr. Best, under the title of The Adventures of Art son of Conn? the men of Ireland enjoy three harvests of corn annually so long as Conn is wedded to his fitting spouse Eithne TaebJota; but when she dies and he marries in her stead the disreputable Becuma, there " is neither corn nor milk in Ireland." The exercise by the king of his marital functions acts sympathetically on the fertility of the land and of the cattle. It is to be noted in passing that when Eithne died she was buried in Tailltiu; was this the normal cemetery of the queens of Ireland ? If so, the fact is of some importance. The point is, that Becuma had been banished from among the Tuatha De Danann for her misdeeds. She was therefore not any more acceptable to the gods than was the foreigner Coirpre Cat head. Probably we are to understand that the feminine principle of fertility refused to acknowledge her, as the masculine principle refused to acknowledge Coirpre. To avert the curse that had in consequence fallen upon the land, it had to be re-quickened with the blood of the son of a sinless couple. How such a youth was found, how he was condemned to be slain and was redeemed with the blood of a cow, and how Becuma was finally expelled from Temair, will be found in the original story, which is one of the most valuable, from the point of view of folk-lore, that we possess. Just as an elaborate ritual had to be gone through, as we shall see in a moment, in order to restore the continuity of the kingship when it had been broken by what we should call the natural death of the king, so the blood of a youth of miraculous birth had to be shed on the ground outraged by the king's marriage with a person forbidden. In Christian times the saints appear to have entered on the heritage of the kings as earnests for the goodness of the crops. Thus St. Patrick, prophesying of St. Senan, promises this boon so long as the people shall be obedient to the saint.* We might explain this as a reminiscence of some 1 Revae eeltiqne, xiii, 456. 2 Irische Texte, i, 118. It is evidently wrong to explahv this, with Nutt, as a fear of the excessive use of the droit du seigneur (Voyage of Bran, ii, 51). The marriage of the king would not necessarily interfere with such a practice, which in any case is mythical: see the discussion in Frazer, Folk-lore in the Old Testament, vol. i, p. 485 ff. 3 $rin, iii, 149, 4 Lismore Life of St. Senan, ed. Stokes, line 1855.</page><page sequence="96">326 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. thing that had been said of the fertilizing river-god, if we had not something analogous in the life of St. Findian. We there read that a barren patch of land was made fruitful by sprinkling it with water in which a eulogy of the saint had been steeped.1 The divine king has been studied fully by Sir James Frazer in his monumental work The Golden Bough. This study is based on the remarkable institution of the Rex Nemorensis, the priest-king of the sacred grove of Aricia at Nemi. It is not for nothing that Rex Temorensis differs by a single letter only from Rex Nemorensis ;2 for the analogies which the two kingships present are so remarkable that it is impossible to escape from the conclusion that they belong to the same order of ideas, if indeed they are not more closely connected still. The candidate for the priesthood of the grove at Aricia challenged the existing incumbent to single combat by the rite of breaking the " Golden Bough," and if in the combat he succeeded in killing the priest, he ipso facto succeeded to the office. Sir James Frazer has convincingly shown that this strange practice was based on the desire to have the strongest man available. One who from weakness or want of vigilance permitted himself to be killed was clearly unsuitable for the responsible office of royal deity. It is perfectly obvious from the history, as it is enshrined in the works of the " official historians," that the king of Temair, like the king of the grove at Aricia, reigned by virtue of having slain his predecessor. This point, which Dr. Baudis seems to have missed, is one of the most important arguments in favour of the thesis which both he and I sustain. Omitting the kings of the Fir Bolg and of the Tuatha De Danann, I find 110 kings enumerated in Flaithiusa hErenn as having reigned from Eremon down to Conn Cet-chathach, the grandfather of Cormac mac Airt. Of these, 80 are said to have been killed by their successors. As we have already seen, the "official historians" explained this as a blood-feud, going back to the time when Eremon, the first king, killed his brother Eber at the battle of Geashill. But this explanation will not serve at all. The whole scheme of relationships on which it is based is utterly irreconcilable with the data. Any group of the kings will show this; the following series, selected at random, will serve as an illustration;? Finn reigned 22 years and was killed by Setna. Setna ? 20 ? ? ? Siomon Brecc. Siom6n ? 6 ? ? ? Dui son of Setna. 1 Lismore Lives, ed.

Muiredach ? 1 year ? ? Enna son of Dui. Enna ? 12 years and died of plague. Lugaid ? 9 ? and was killed by Sirlam son of Finn. ?which means that fifty-eight years intervened between the death of Finn and the succession of his son Sirlamh. Improbabilities of this kind are too frequent in the list of kings to make it possible to accept it literally. On the other hand, it is not a mere paradox to say that the fact that such obvious improbabilities exist is the best possible argument in favour of the view that there is a genuine tradition underlying the list of kings. Mere forgers would not have filled their work with so many difficulties^ But in the light of the wealth of illustrative examples which Sir James Frazer has collected from all over the world, we must see in this organized slaying of the king by his successor something other than a blood-feud extending through a large number of generations, and involving relationships spread over impossible lapses of time. Doubtless the " official historians" were puzzled by the regularity with which each king met his death at the hands of his successor, and felt obliged to explain it. Not knowing of the system of the Arician priesthood, they had to cast about elsewhere ; and they found a blood-feud as the easiest way of accounting for the perplexing fact. The genealogies were manipulated accordingly, the slayer of a slayer being assumed to be a relative of the first victim; but the result only makes obvious the impossi bility of the " blood-feud " theory. If in the light of this we look back at what I have called the " epic " dynasty, we find an unexpected corroboration of these conclusions. For the practice of predecessor-killing does not begin till the fourth name in the Ultonian and the Fir Bolg lists; the Tuatha 1)6 Danann version is not so clear, but does not contradict the observation. That is, the kings do not kill their predecessors until they cease to be gods by nature and become men. There does not appear to be anywhere extant an indication of the process whereby a candidate for royalty challenged the reigning king. At Aricia the candidate for the priesthood broke what was called the Golden Bough, which Sir James Frazer has tried to prove was the mistletoe. This may be so; and the description of the cutting of the mistletoe contained in an oft-quoted passage of Pliny may not inconceivably be in some way connected with the election of a new chieftain?Pliny has no information to give us as to the occasion on which, and the purpose for which, the remarkable rite which he described was performed.1 The prohibition against bringing arms into 1 Pliny, Nat. Hist, xvi, 95. R.I.A. PR0C, VOL. XXXIV, SECT, C. [45]</page><page sequence="98">328 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Temair after sunset1 was perhaps designed for the protection of the king against a surreptitious attack. In the short list of kings quoted above it will be seen that one of them, Enna by name, died of plague. It is almost an invariable rule that when the kings do not die at the hands of their successors, there is something unexpected or sudden about the manner of their departure from life?battle, lightning, plague; in the case of Sldnoll, already mentioned, " an unknown disease, whereby he was found dead in Temair"; nearly always some exceptional accident is invoked to explain why he died without the assistance of an ambitious rival. Such an event as the natural death of the king was probably regarded as a direct interposition on the part of some god. This is actually so expressed in the case of king Eterseele. From Togdil Bruidne Bd Derga we learn that he died naturally ;2 the " official historians " tell us that he was killed by his successor Nuadu Necht. But Nuadu Necht is only a manifestation of the great god Nuadu ;3 the king was therefore killed by the god. When such an event took place, it became necessary to restore the succession. From Aricia we have, apparently, no answer to the question of what happened if the Rex Nemorensis should happen to die a natural death.4 Probably the case never arose; in a city full of slaves such as Rome was, there would always be someone who would prefer even the anxious life of the King of the Grove, to the hopeless toil of servitude ; for the Rex Nemorensis was always an escaped slave. But in Ireland the untoward event sometimes took place. 1 explain certain remarkable rites of which we have a record as being the means whereby in such a ease the succession was restored. Someone, presumably a druid, glutted himself with the flesh and broth of a white [sacred] bull, and then went to sleep, while four druids chanted over his body an or firindi, or " spell of truth."5 The appointed king would appear to the sleeper amid the nightmares induced by his overloaded stomach. Doubtless it was understood that he had made himself one with the bull divinity by eating as much of its flesh as was physically possible, and that in his dreams he was thinking the thoughts of the god. For inspiration by incubation we may compare the curious anecdote of the lazy pupil of 1 Lebor Aide, in Ancient Laws of Ireland, iii, 82. 2 Bevue ccltiqite, xxii, 22, 3 See Rhys, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 122-124, where this is clearly shown. 4 Sir James Frazer has kindly confirmed this in a private letter to me. 5 See Serylige Con-Chulaind in Irische Texte, i, 213; Revue celtique, xxii/?2; and analogies in Frazer, The Magic Arly i, 381-383. For many analogies to this custom of electing a ruler by divination, see Mr. Hartland's essay, The Voice of the Stme of Destiny (Folk-lore, xiv, 28-60).</page><page sequence="99">Macamstek?Temair Breg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 329 Mael-Buain of Tallaght, who was inspired with knowledge of his unlearnt lesson by sleeping on the knee of Oengus, the author of the Feilire.1 It is tempting to ask whether a story originally told of the deified hero, Oengus of the Brug, may not have been transferred to his saintly namesake, with such modifications as were necessary to adapt it to a monastic background: all the more so as we are told immediately before that Oengus was so diligent in his labours in the monastic corn-store that" the corn-blades grew through his hair." This looks like an idea suggested by some picture of the Corn-spirit. To return, however, from these speculations to the subject before us, we learn next that the king, thus selected, had to pass through certain rites, which are enumerated in a tract called De Shil Chonairi Moir? It is not strictly correct to call these rites " ordeals," which would imply that they were primarily means of selection. If the new king failed to fulfil all the conditions of the rites, he would naturally be rejected, and as they are descrihed in the text before us this would appear to be iheir main purpose. But it is evident that the primary intention of the rites was initiation. The king, having been already chosen by the incubation process just described, was now to be inducted to office. The ceremonies of initiation were four in number, and as described in the text quoted were as follows :? (1). The candidate mounted on a chariot, which tilted under him if he were not legitimate, and the horses, which were new to harness, sprang at him. (2). The candidate put on a mantle, which would be too big for him if he were rejected. (8). The candidate drove in the chariot to the stones Blocc and Bluicne (Moel is not mentioned in the text): these opened out wide enough to let him through if he were accepted, but closed before him if he were rejected. (4). The candidate, having passed these tests successfully, was ted up to F&amp;l, which uttered a shriek against the chariot-wheel if he were accepted, and was silent if he were rejected. But surely all this impossible magic belongs to the region of fairy-tales! Who ever heard in real life of screaming and moving stones, of knowledgeable horses, of elastic mantles ? A very reasonable criticism this, on the list of rites as they are set forth in the text before us. But the difficulty lies, not in the rites, which are simple and commonplace enough in themselves, but in the fact that the author who has transmitted the record of them to us was completely in the dark as to what they meant. If we are more fortunate than he was, the reason is because we have a large body of records of savage life and ceremonies at our disposal. In the corroborees of the aborigines of Australia, a country unknown to the ancient writer, lies the clue to the 1 Fettirt Oengusso, Bradshaw ed., p. 12. % Edited by Mr. Lucius Gwynn in Eriu, vi, 130. [45*J</page><page sequence="100">330 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. comprehension of the rites which he describes. Let us consider these initiatory rites in order, and see what we can make of them in the light of modern anthropological knowledge. The horse-test cannot be dissociated from the most interesting account of the inauguration of the chieftains of Cenel Conaill described by Giraldus Cambrensis,1 to the righteous indignation of Keating and other worthy souls. Peace be with them?it was simply impossible for Giraldus, with the limited knowledge of his time, to invent so charmingly complete an account of a savage totemistic initiatory rite. A white mare was led to the place of inauguration : the candidate entered on all-fours?in fact, he pretended to be a horse, as the kangaroo and emu and witchetty-grub totem-groups of Australia pretend on occasion to be kangaroos, and so forth, in action as in name. The mare was then killed, and the chieftain-elect bathed in its broth, while he and his people partook of a solemn feast of its flesh. Nothing could more clearly show that Cenel Conaill was a tribe with a horse-totem, and that the chieftain of the tribe was, on his initiation, admitted, as we may express it, to " horse-ship."2 We need not, perhaps, infer that the rite was practised in its pristine perfection at the late date at which Giraldus wrote, even though he reports it as contemporary. But if not, he must have had access to some authoritative literary description of the custom, descended from the time at which it was in use. That it should have been an invention is a sheer impossibility. So, at Temair, the king began with some kind of encounter with horses. But what was the nature of this encounter? The description which we possess has been worn down to the lowest possible terms ; all that we are told is that if (for reasons unstated and to us obscure) the candidate was not to be king of Temair, the "horses would spring at him " {concligtis ind hichfris). Certain analogies presented by primitive Greek rites suggest that in the original form of the ceremony it was rather the king who sprang at the horses. M. Salomon Reinach, in his paper on Hippolytus,3 has argued persuasively that the legend of the virtuous youth torn in pieces by his horses has arisen in a savage rite in which it was the horses that were torn in * Topographia Hiherniae, iii, 25. , .3 That delightfully naive person, Lynch, the author of Oambrenais Eversus,after expending himself in a denunciation of the shamelessness of Giraldus for reporting this ritual, gives his whole case away by adding nullibi certe tamfoeda, alibi ludicra initiations aliqui principatum auspicantur, and then quoting two examples of parallel rites whicli afforded the best possible confirmation of Giraldus available in the literature at his dis posal. -Gould he have lived to read some modern compilations of savage practices, it is to be feared that he would have had to strike out the words nullibi tarn foeda ! 3 Hippolyte in Chdtes, Mythes, et Religions, iii, 54.</page><page sequence="101">Macauster?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditioris of Tara. 331 pieces; and that, like Dionysos, Zagreus, Adonis, Pentheus, Orpheus, A ctaeon, the tale told about his being thus dismembered had its origin in a custom wherein a totem animal suffered the treatment (airapayinoi;) and was devoured whole (i)jj,o(f&gt;ajia). Just such a rite is clearly to be seen in Giraldus's account of the Cenel Conaill ceremonies. The purpose of the rite is to quicken the life of the clan by feeding on the totem animal: that the chief par excellence was to be steeped (literally as well as metaphorically) in the being of the totem is indicated by the custom which required him to immerse himself in the animal's broth and to drink of it without the intervention of any vessel, even his hand. If anything was wanting to confirm the substantial accuracy of Giraldus's account, it is this important detail. Just as in Greek legend the horse torn in pieces became the chaste youth flippolytus, slain by his chariot horses, so in Irish legend the horse torn in pieces became the unsuccessful candidate for monarchy, " at whom the horses would spring." The totem animal rejected the illegitimate aspirant. But it may perhaps be/that the report of the rite in the text before us is due to a confusion with another rite, probably (though not certainly) independent of inauguration ceremonies such as we are discussing. We must not omit to compare the Thracian rite of sacrificing men to secure fertility for the land, the victims being put to death by being trampled by horses.1 Possibly a sacrifice of this kind took place on the occasion of the inauguration of a monarch of Temair, and the author who reported the ceremony mixed the victim with the king. The king, having been chosen for office by the solemn incubation, would hardly himself be the victim. The successful candidate, probably by devouring the flesh of the horse, passed into a state of "horse-ship " ; and it is not for nothing that so many kings of Temair, in the official history, bore the name Eochu, a derivative from ech; " a horse." Eochu Oll-athair and Eochu Oll-Ilaith, who, as we have seen, are avatars of the founder of the monarchy, bore the name; we may perhaps conjecture that all the kings, as a matter of course, originally were called Eochu, as a sign of their partaking of the divine horse. Eremon himself appears later in the roll of kings as Eochu Aireni. Here again we have a most remarkable parallel between the worship of the Arician grove and that of Temair. For one of the divinities enshrined at Neuii was the ancient Italian god Virbius; and a legend had it that this Virbius was no other than the young Greek hero Hippolytus.2 We may refer the reader to Frazer's discussion of this equation and its probable basis; but 1 See Cook's Zeus, vol. i, p. 75, and references in foot-note 7 on the'same page. 2 Frazer, The Magic Art, i, 19.</page><page sequence="102">332 Proceedings of the Royal Trish Academy. we cannot pass over the coincidence of a horse deity at Aricia and a totemistic horse-ritual at Temair. There is another explanation of the chariot-rite possible. Mr. Cook has referred me to his valuable articles in the Classical Review, vols, xvii, xviii, in the course of which he brings evidence to show that the chariot-races at the Olympic games and at similar celebrations were originally intended as tests for the selection of a god-king. It might therefore be suggested that at Temair there was also a chariot-race, whereby the king was selected; or, preferably, that the king, already selected by the incubation, was required to prove his ability to control wild horses (sun-horses ?). In the concluding section we shall see how the rites of Temair are linked to other rites recorded from elsewhere in Europe; and the analogies which the passages brought forward by Mr. Cook present must be accorded their full weight. We must also not forget the remarkable horse-racing, feasting, sacrificial, and military scenes represented on the well-known series of early iron-age Venetian sittdae, which have every appearance of referring to similar cele brations. But the Cenel Conaill rite blocks the way to a complete acceptance of this alternative explanation. We here plumb a yet deeper stratum of primitive custom; and, perhaps, we see enacted before us the ceremonies which later developed into the Olympic horse-race?just as the gracious figure of Hippolytus may have developed out nf a savage who tore a horse to pieces and devoured it raw and half alive - The second rite, that of the magic mantle, can best be understood in the light of the third, which we accordingly shall consider first of the two. The third rite was that of the stones Blocc and Bluicne. It will be remembered that these were two of three stones set over certain druids of the same names. Now there is a very remarkable expression used about these stones in PD 21, to which we have not yet referred. We there read of them teora clocha roldithi forsna druidih," the three stones that were placed upon the druids." In the descriptions of other standing stones, such are called the keht or gravestone of So-and-so; but this expression is not used here. VD iii 75, 76 uses an equally curious expression; forru atdit na tri clocha dusfarlaic Mat mdr-Maeha, " on them (ie. on the three druids) are the three stones which M&amp;i of great Macha flung." These passages point to some deed of violence; we may perhaps be not far wrong if we infer that Moei and his fellows were buried alive under the stones.1 This is confirmed by what "^"TiTke the hostages of Fiachra, Revue cettioiie, xxiv, 184. Compare also" the sentence passed upon the daughter of the Ulidian king in Togdit Bruidne Dd Derga&gt; ibid., xxii, 18, 19. Mr. Cuok suggests to me a comparison with the myth of the invulnerable</page><page sequence="103">Macaijstkr?Temair Breg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 333 follows in PD : hit e a anmand A. Moel} etc.; " these are their names (i.e. the names of the stones), Moel," etc. The personalities of the druids had passed into the stones erected over them; in fact, these stones are the druids, and as such they help to initiate the rightful king. Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne became the stock names for druids at Temair; so important were the stones associated with them. They appear in the tale Baile an Scdil,1 as the persons who interpreted the scream of FAl to Conn Cet-chath&amp;ch. And they appear in the story of St. Patrick's contention with druids of king Loeguire. For surely it is clear that LOCHRU ET LUCETMAEL, the names of the two druids with which the saint had to deal, are simply corruptions of (b)luicne et (b)loco et mael, the same names, in the reverse order.2 But how did the stones open or close before the candidate ? To this question there is but one possible answer. The stones were set close together?though we need not take an pied de la lettre the assertion that they were normally so close together that " only the edge of a baud could pass between them "3?and the candidate had to squeeze between them. If he failed to do so, he was rejected. Similar rites of squeezing through a narrow space?a split tree, a hole in the ground, an opening in a rock, or a space between two objects set close together?are found in many parts of the world. The custom is followed for a variety of purposes : as a curative act, in cases of disease ; as a test of legitimacy of birth ;* or, as in the present case, as a test of worthiness for some privilege. The rite has ramifications which here we cannot follow ; they have been studied by Henri Gaidoz in a monograph.5 The nearest analogue to the Temair rite is to be seen in a mosque at Jerusalem, and Kaiueus, crushed into the earth by Centaurs under a heap of fig-branches. Indeed the representation of the scene on the broken frieze of the Theseion (Baumeister, Denhmaler fig. 1868) seems to show the Centaurs pressing him into the ground under the weight of a great stone. The burial of the druids might have taken place to secure luck, at the original establishment of the sanctuary : cf. the well-known Iona story. \ O'Curry, MS. Materials, p. 618. 2 For.these druids see Tripartite Life, p. 273. Moel was also the name of a druid at Cruachu ; ibid., p. 92. 3 Erin, vi, 134. 4 See Doubdan, Le voyage de la Terre Sainte (Paris, 1666), p. 57, or Morison, Belation historiqne d\m voyage nouvellement fait au Mont de Sinai et an Jerusalem ^Toul, 1704), p 347, for a rite of this kind observed in the seventeenth century at the Church of ;the Holy Sepulchre, as a test of legitimacy. For similar rites carried out for other purposes, reference may be made to the brochure by Gaidoz, mentioned in the following foot-note, 6 J7? yierix rite medicate* Opuscule offert a Anatole de Barthelemy, Paris, 1892,</page><page sequence="104">334 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. another at Cairo. In each of these places there is a pair of pillars, set close together, and the ciceroni inform visitors that only he who can squeeze between the pillars can obtain admission to heaven. At Cairo thelspace between the pillars has been appreciably widened by the attrition of the inner surfaces of the pillars; at Jerusalem an iron grille has been inserted to prevent the experiment being made?it is said because a certain fat man met his death by endeavouring to force himself through the narrow space. Sir James Frazer, quoting the essay by Gaidoz,1 says that its author " rightly rejects the theory that all such passages are symbols of a new birth"?as though the patient were born into a new world of health, of legitimacy, of fitness for office, or what-not. This, however, does not exactly express the conclusion of the French scholar, as reference to p. 77 of his essay will show.2 It is not the crude idea of physical re-birth which he rejects as explanatory of this rite, but the ethical ideas which for us. form almost the exclusive sense of the word "regeneration." In this he is no doubt right; but he does not, and so far as I can judge he should not, wholly reject the view that the rite is essentially an attempt to express the notion of a physical re-birth. If this idea be associated with the ceremony, it is doubtless not to the exclusion of others. For instance, the split tree through which a sickly infant has been passed is ever afterwards linked with the life of the child ; we must therefore infer that the tree and the child have some physical connexion for which the re-birth theory would not wholly account. But in the study of folk-lore and folk-beliefs inconsistencies and complications of this kind are only what we may expect. Very few primitive rites and ceremonies are capable of a simple explanation. They all, as it were, possess tentacles to which other notions early attach themselves; and as these accretions vary considerably in different surroundings, the study even of the most rudimentary ceremony becomes a matter of extreme complexity. Whether or not any additional ideas were associated with the rites of the stones of Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne, the most reasonable explanation of what we are told about them, in the light of other practices elsewhere, seems to be that the candidate for kingship, by squeezing between them, was regarded as having been born into a new life. And when we learn that before the ceremony a mantle was put upon him which was required to be close-fitting, we may fairly regard this as a confirmation of this explanation. For in re-birth ceremonies an essential part of the rite would, be the reproduction of the * Balder the Beautiful, ii, 171, note. / * '" Nous admettons bien,-^pourquelques-uhsdescasquen6usayonscit4s,^lath^orie de la nouvelle naissance, parce qu'il s?agit 1&amp; d'ttne image materialle et en quelcjue sbrte* d'une idee materialiste/'</page><page sequence="105">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 335 prenatal life of the neophyte. He is tightly folded in a covering that represents the womb.1 From this he shuffles his way out into the new life that awaits him. This is what appears to be the meaning of the mantle-rite which we passed over just now. That the candidate went through the proceeding in a state of ceremonial nudity is implied, though not definitely stated, by the description of the horse-rite in Giraldus; the nakedness of Conaire, which is emphasized at the beginning of Togdil Bruidne Dd Derga, is perhaps a reminiscence of this. But it will be objected that the document before us asserts that the king drove up to and between the stones in his chariot. If this is to be accepted, it is useless to attempt to explain the ceremonies which are at the moment occupying our attention. It is safe to say that whatever may or may not have happened at the inauguration of a monarch, he did not drive up to certain standing stones in his chariot, expecting them to open before him of their own accord. The writer who reports the ceremonies has misunderstood and naturally has garbled them ; it is only by comparison with similar rites that it is possible to reconstruct their original form. It is easy to understand why our author has intoduced the chariot so awkwardly here. The ceremony begins with a chariot-rite ; the final test, at Fal, is against a wheel, supposed to be the chariot-wheel. The writer who is our authority naturally inferred that the king remained in his chariot the whole time. As an alternative explanation it has been suggested to me that the robe might have been a sort of Vepoe iriirXog by means of which the king was symbolically invested with divinity. The theory is worth putting on record, though I find in it one serious difficulty?such an investiture would not be likely to have taken place before the passage through the stones, if only for the practical reason that it would very seriously hamper the neophyte's progress through the narrow space, and would be sure to get torn. Had the mantle been assumed after the passage through the stones, this would obviously have been the only reasonable explanation of the part which it played in the inauguration. Moreover the explanation offered above explains wThy the robe was meant to be close-fitting: a mere symbolic robe would be more likely to be full and flowing. We have seen that the tract mentions only two stones, omitting Moel. Groups of two stones are on the whole commoner than groups of three; and for the purpose of the squeezing rite two stones would be sufficient, and three a superfluity. It is hard to decide which version is correct. The Patrician 1 See some examples in Frazer, Taboo and the Perils of the Sotd, p. 113; The Magic Art, i, 380. R.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C. [46]</page><page sequence="106">336 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. documents reduce these three druids to two, but the way in which their names are stated shows that there were originally three separate names? otherwise we might reasonably suppose that there were actually only two stones, called Moel-Bluicc and Bluicne. In such a case Blocc would necessarily have been the name of $ god, otherwise unattested ; for the formula Moel- is essentially theophorous, like Fer-, Nia-, Mug-, and sometimes Mac-. On the other hand, the three names are cast into the formula usual in such triplicities. These are almost invariably in the form A,B,B', in which B' is an orthographical variant of B, or at least is connected with B by assonance or alliteration. Thus, the three sons of Tuiriu, otherwise called the " gods of the Tuatha De Danann," were Brian, luchar, lucharba. The three guardian spirits of the sacred well of Sid Nechtain were called Flesc, Lesc, and Luam. Even in the modern chapbook reprinted in Thackeray's Irish Sketch-look we find the same formula, Hudden, Dudden, and Donald O'Neary.1 In such cases it will generally be found that it is the individual with the singular name?A of the formula?that is the effective personality ; the other two, B and B', being merely the chorus. Here, however, we have a remarkable exception to this rule: Blocc and Bluicne are the important stones, while Moel is in the background. The evolution of the formula is easily understood. The Celtic gods originated in groups of shadowy beings, of indefinite number and very feebly developed personality, who gradually crystallized into clear-cut individuals. Thus, the sun-god Lug is a condensation, so to speak, of a previous group of Lugoves, for whose existence we have epigraphic evidence. When attempts were made to form a conception, either mental or graphic, of these beings, it was natural to figure them in threes, three being the first number in which plurality can be expressed ; one figure represents 6t6gy two fltco, and three (,W. Such symbolical groups of three figures inevitably suggest groups of three independent personalities. When it comes to name these, one of them will be given a name in the singular number, derived from the plural by which the original group was known; and the other two will be fitted with factitious names which will naturally tend to resemble one another. Such a group as Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne is therefore only what We might expect. Thus there were most probably three stones, not two ; but only, two of them, set the more closely together, were used for the squeezing rite. It will not escape notice that what has been said above is fatal to Petrie's identification of these 1 Other examples of triplicities similarly constructed will be found in a list of the Tuatha De* Danann in Irische Texte, iii, 58. The assonance of the added names (B, B) is analogous to the assonance frequently observed in the names of twins ; on which see Rendel Harris, The Onlt of the Heavenly Twins, chap, viii,</page><page sequence="107">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 337 stones with the small stones in the churchyard. Though described as clocha becca, these stones must have been at least as high as a man's shoulders. Finally the candidate, thus " re-born," was led up to Fal, which uttered a scream if he were acceptable. Dind-shenchas Erenn says that it screamed under the new king, as though he stood upon it. The well-known quatrain of Cinaed 6 hArtacain, beginning an cloch forstad mo di shdil, " the stone on which my heels stand," accords with this. The tract 6^7 Chonairi Moir says that it screamed " against the axle of the chariot." The stone variously called Fal, or Lia Fail, was the central " fetish " of Temair, and it becomes a matter of great importance to find out what it was. So important was it, that Inis Fail, Mag Fail, are familiar names for the whole of Ireland. Temair itself was Temair Fail, FaTs Prospect-hill, to distinguish it from the other places called Temair in Ireland.1 The personal name Fraech Fail is also recorded.2 The followers of Find mac Umaill are the"Fianaof Fal."3 Whatever the camp-followers of Celtic studies may suppose (be they mediaeval chroniclers or modern ecstatics of the Fiona MacLeod type), we may take it for granted that the signification of Lia Fail is nothing so poetical as " Stone of Destiny." " Stone of the Fence," or " of the Hedge," would serve as a translation, with a possible reference to its use as a guardian of the fitness of the king. In such a case, however, we should have expected the definite article. The fact that it is omitted, and that the stone is frequently spoken of simply as " Fal "?which, indeed, appears to be its most legitimate name? indicates that Fal is to be taken preferably as a proper name, either of a man or of a god.4 As there does not appear to be any trace of a man of the name, we prefer to interpret it as the name of a god. 'The stone Fal is called Ferp Cluche in the tract Sil Chonairi Moir. Ferp is a loan-word from the Latin uerpa; and Baudis infers (loc. cit. p. 106) that the stone was a phallus. This inference, however, is not justified. The fact that a loan-word is used is strongly against it, as indicating that we are to see an ecclesiastical denunciation of a pagan monument rather than a genuine tradition of the significance of the stone.3 It is, in fact, one more of the spiteful 1 See Rhys, Hibbert Lectures, p. 207, and references there. 3 Revue celtique, xxix, 138. 3 Festschrift Whitley Stokes, p. 9. 4 Cormac explains fal as ri (king). O'Davoren says ri no mwir, " king, or sea/' The expression " lia Fail " is used in the poem by Cinaed 6 hArtacain entitled Aided a fond do hUaislib Erenn simply in the sense of "a big stone": see Eevue celtique, xxiii, 306, line 3, and the note on the passage, p. 333. 3 Compare Cenuerbe, the name given to Cenn Criiaich in Colgan's Secunda Vita Patricii. [46*]</page><page sequence="108">338 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. nicknames given by the adherents of the one creed to the gods of the other. The modern name Bod Fhergais, which Petrie records,1 cannot be cited in corroboration of the phallic theory. In the first place, it cannot be absolutely proved that the stone so denominated is the genuine original Fal, however likely this may be; and in the second place, that name is clearly nothing more than a piece of rough country humour.2 Unhewn standing stones may be, and very probably are in many cases, rude substitutes for statues ; but there is not the smallest evidence that they represent phalli, at any rate in Europe. Just as Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne were the receptacles of personalities of the three druids buried underneath them, and acted under the inspiration of their superhuman intelligences, so Fal was the receptacle of the divinity whose name it bore. Almost too tempting to be admissible is a suggestion which might be made, to the effect that Ferp does not represent uerpa, but Virbius, the name of the god of the grove of Neini. The Master of Emmanuel College, whom I consulted on this possibility, writes as follows: " I agree with you that a connexion between Ferp and uerpa would probably be only a piece of virulent ecclesiastical hostility. I doubt if uerpa was a word in popular use at all. Nobody knows what its origin was, and so far as I know it has left no descendants in the Romance languages. On the other hand, Virbius also seems to have no cognates, in proper names at any rate. From a phonetic point of view I do not see any serious difficulty in connecting Virbius and Ferp, if we were sure that the i in the Fw'-syllable was original (it would then be like vir and fer)y and that the b was original. The lack of cognates makes this uncertain, and if b represents an original dh, which in the neighbourhood of r it very well might, the identity would not be possible. There is of course the further point that at Aricia the Latin would be strongly marked with dialect, in which case the i of the first syllable might represent an older e; or if it were a long vowel (as to that, we- have no evidence) it might arise from early diphthongs. Thus, as generally happens with the etymology of rare words, the data are not sufficient to give a certain conclusion in favour of, but offer no serious obstacle against your view : and the other points you mention are certainly tempting enough to warrant you in going on."a 1 Tara, p. 159. 2 Similarly, M. Salomon Reinach (Cultes, iii, 371), after citing an analogous name attached to a French standing stone, adds: " C'est le seul exemple que je connaisse d'une de'nominafcion phallique ; elle requite eVidemment d'une comparaison rustique, et ne peut etre alleguee a Tappui de la these qui voit des emblemes de la generation dans les menhirs." 3 It is a further curious coincidence that we have a stone of Maine at Temair, and that the name Manius is closely connected with Aricia : see Cook, in Folk-lore, xvi 291-293.</page><page sequence="109">Macalister?Temair Breg; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 339 Another point of importance to notice about F&amp;l is a constant tradition that it was not native to Temair; coupled with an expectation that it was not destined to remain there for ever. As to the place from which it came, authorities differ; but they agree in representing that it came from elsewhere. Thus, Lebor Gabala enumerates it among the four treasures brought into Ireland by the Tuatha De Danann. It came, so we are told, from the city Falias; while Lug's invincible spear was brought from Gorias, Nuadu's sword from Finnias, and The Dagda's inexhaustible cauldron from Murias.1 Thus the stone is brought into association with three of the most important deities in the pantheon. The names of the cities are obviously factitious, formed by someone who had deciphered a name like Ercias on an Ogham inscription, and recognized the common name Ere, but was not very clear as to the meaning of the archaic genitive termination ias. Falias is thus formed from the name of Fal; and the apparent meaning of Fal (" wall") has suggested Mur, and thus given a foundation on which to base the city Murias. Some vague recollection of a legendary king Nuadu Finn-fail has suggested Finnias, whence Nuadu obtained his sword ; and Gorias Igor = fire) is a suitable place for the sun-god Lug to find his destroying spear. Thus Fal lies at the base of three out of the four cities in which the Tuatha De Danann learnt their magic. Baile an Scdil, the tale to which reference has already been made, tells a different story. According to this interesting text, the druids Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne explained to Conn Cet-chathach that the stone came from Inis Fo-ail, was set in Temair Tire Fail, and was destined hereafter to find its way to Tailltiu. Inis Fo-ail is merely a perversion of Inis Fail, in the interests of an absurd etymology (fo ail, "under a king"). Thus, what the druids said was that the stone came to Temair from Inis Fail. This implies that Inis Fail is not Ireland, but some other island. When we seek for another island bearing this name, we have not far to look. The little islet in Wexford Harbour,2 now called Beggery Island fa corruption of Beg-Eire, Little Ireland), also bears the name of Inis Fail. Beg-Eire is the site of a very ancient ecclesiastical establishment, associated with the name of Ibar, traditionally said to have been one of the pre-Patrician saints of Ireland. Now it may be laid down as at least a working hypothesis, that the existence of an ancient Celtic monastery on such an island is presumptive evidence of the pre-existence of a pagan sanctuary 1 Book of Ballymote, facs. 32 a 15-25. 2 No longer an island, owing to land reclamation.</page><page sequence="110">340 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. on the same spot; the missionaries and early fathers of the church in Ireland being desirous of diverting the sanctity of the island from the false to the true Faith. This is certainly the case of Inis Muiredaig in Sligo Bay; the church there, called Teampull na Teineadh, with its sacred fire-hearth (site of " one of the three sacred perennial fires of Ireland "),* preserves the memory of some fire-ceremony that assuredly was not Christian. It seems also to be the case at Inis Cealtra, where, as I have shown in my account of the site, there is very complete evidence for the former existence of a sacred tree. And the name of Inis FAil affixed to the island of St. Ibarcan only mean that this island was a centre of rites similar to those which centred in the stone of F41; at least, that in some way or other the god immanent in the stone of F&amp;l was there honoured. Of the servant of Christ who founded and laboured in the church of Beg Eire, and who now enjoys his reward, nothing is known. For it is clear that the few facts recorded of him belong, not to him, but to his pagan pre decessors. His very name is forgotten; that of the sacred yew-tree {ibar) of the island has been substituted. Another island in Wexford Harbour had a sacred oak-tree upon it, from which it derived the name Dair-inis, " Oak Island." Probably Beg Eire had an alternative name analogous to this Inis Ibair, " island of the yew-tree." In time this was understood to mean " Island of Ibar," interpreted as referring to the forgotten founder of the monastery. In like manner, the unknown hermit of Inis Cathaigh has been tricked out incongruously with the name of the river-god Senan, who probably had a sanctuary in the conspicuous island at the mouth of the river. Let it be clearly understood that the historicity of these saints is not in question. That is amply attested by the existence of the ruins of the religious houses associated with them. But their names have suffered the usual fate of names handed down by tradition, and have become confused with other names which by reason of a much longer history, stretching far back into the unknown abysses of pagan ages, had made a deeper impression on popular memory. A case even more remarkable than the two above cited is that of the foundress of the nunnery of Kildare. There was doubtless here, in pagan times, a college of priestesses who tended a perpetual fire, and who (pre sumably with orgiastic rites resembling those of the Gaulish priestesses of Sena) honoured the fire-goddess Brigid, this divinity being immanent in the sacred sun-oak which gave to the place the name that it still bears. Probably the head of the college was regarded as an incarnation of the goddess, and so bore 1 Silva Gadelica, i, 42 ; ii, 41: Wakeman, Inismurray, pp. 51-66.</page><page sequence="111">Macalister? Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 341 her name, as the kings of Temair bore the name of Eochu. But one of the succession came under Christian influence, and, embracing the Faith of the Cross, she accomplished the tremendous feat of converting the pagan sanctuary into a Christian religious house?a work in its way far more wonderful than the miracles with which her biographers credit her. It is no detraction from the honour due to her for this achievement, that she could not quite rid the establishment over which she presided of all its pagan vestiges; " the bright lamp that lay in Kildare's holy fane" still "burnt through long ages," not, as Moore foolishly says, of "darkness and storm,"but of Christian Faith and Works. And though it is most probable that she herself changed the official name "Brigid" which hitherto she had borne (for no Christian lady would willingly continue to bear a name so heathenish while paganism was still a force), it was too deeply rooted in the folk-memory, and continued to be used locally to designate her. To return to St. Ibar, we are told that he resented the coming of St. Patrick,1 which would hardly be to his credit if he were a Christian, but would be intelligible if the story were first told of a pagan. His mother's name Lassar (" flame ") is suggestive in this connexion,2 as well as her origin from the Desi of Breg. He is one of the saints to whom a life of portentous length is assigned by the Annalists (the Four Masters, for example, tell us that he died a.d. 500 at the age of 304 years; the Martyrology of Donegal adds another century). And a " very ancient old book " cited by the Martyrology of Donegal states that in habits and in life he resembled St. John the Baptist ?a remark of great significance, as we shall see. Beg Eire is situated in the estuary of the river Slaney. We have already seen that the god of the Slaney, under his two names, Slainge and (Mo-)Donn(os), appears as the leader of both the Fir Bolg and the Milesian invasion; and we have suggested that the latter is the original form of the story, the former a contaminated version. In Ptolemy's time the south-east corner of the island seems to have been endowed with peculiar sanctity. We see in his map the Sacred Promontory, and names like Birgos (the river Barrow), and the tribe of the Brigantes, containing the same linguistic element as the name of the fire-goddess Brigid. It is suggestive in this connexion that the traditional lbar is in his life brought into close association with Kildare. The same element enters into Bregna, a name for the Boyne preserved in Cormac's Glossary. The enormous earthen ring-fort, called Ballytrent, one of the largest and finest earthworks in Ireland, a short distance north of Carnsore 1 Feilire Oengu&amp;so, Glosses, Bradshaw ed., p. 118 ; Life of St. Declan (Irish Texts Society), p. 36. 2 But see Kuno Meyer's note, Todd Lect., xvii, 109, note on p. 6, line 10.</page><page sequence="112">342 Proceedings of the RoyaTIrish Academy* Point (The Sacred Promontory), may well have been a sanctuary of some kind; indeed, there is at Carnsore Point itself a ring-wall, now consecrated by the ruined chapel that bears the name of Mo-bheoc.1 When we recollect further that the plain round Temair is called Mag Breg, after which Temair itself is named Temair Breg, and that in Ptolemy's time Temair had not yet attained a sufficient general importance to obtain a place on bis map; that there was a tradition, ualeat quantum,that Fal had been brought thither from somewhere called Inis Fail; and finally, when we remember that it would be quite possible to imagine the names Eire and Inis Fail being transferred by advancing conquerors from the smaller island to the larger, but that the reverse process is highly improbable, we see the inference stated above confirmed. And having thus concluded that the Slaney estuary saw the first landing of the incoming Celts, we look up the " official histories " to see what they have to say on the subject. Here we find it stated that the Milesians first came to land in Inber Slainge?the Slaney estuary?though the druids of the Tuatha De Danann were able to keep them off by magically causing the country to disappear, so that they sailed round it three times without knowing what they were doing, and finally came to land in Inber Scene (supposed to be Kenmare Biver). Whatever we may make of the latter part of this episode, the first part certainly indicates a tradition which agrees with our deductions. True, there is another explanation for the island in the Slaney estuary being called "Little Ireland." We are told that Ibar and Patrick having quarrelled, the latter pronounced sentence that " Ibar should never be in Ireland." "Ireland shall be the name of the place wherever I shall be," retorted Ibar; so that he called the island of his exile " Little Ireland."2 This reminds us of the curious statement already referred to, that" Cenannus was the name of every place where Fiachu built his house "; perhaps the record of an advancing host ever establishing a sanctuary for its culture-hero when it reaches a fresh stage of its march. Hogan's Onomasticon records only two places of the latter name in Ireland (Kells in Meath and Kells in Ossory), and one in Scotland (Kells in Galloway). There are other places now called Kells in Antrim, Clare, Kerry, and Limerick. These data, however, are scarcely sufficient to enable us to trace the spread of the cult of Fiachu. 1 I have to acknowledge the kindness of my friend the Rev. R. Fitz Henry, P.P., of Broadway, for guiding me over these sites and also over Beg Eire. There is nothing, however, now to be seen at the latter spot having any direct bearing on the subject of this paper/ 3 FeMre Oengusso, Bradshaw ed., p. 118,</page><page sequence="113">Macalistek?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 343 There seems to be a further reminiscence of the importation of the Fal cults into Temair from somewhere else, in the legend of Tea and Tephi. Tephi, as we are told, was buried in Spain, the traditional land or origin of the Milesian people. Tea saw her monument there, and built Temair in imitation of it That is to say, the structure of Temair was modelled on the pattern of some other structure, in- the place (not necessarily Spain) where the worshippers of the gods of Temair came from. When the incoming Celtic speakers had spread inland, and had established their domination over the whole country, tbey took over the ancient sanctuaries, Temair among them, arid there established their new gods, amid the sacred waters, animals, and trees of their Bronze-Age predecessors. Such, then, appears to be the meaning of the statement in the prophecy called Baile an Scatty that Fal came from Inis Fail. The Celtic conquest was still comparatively recent when that story was first told. It was still remembered that the cult of Fal had not been indigenous at Temair, but had been imported from an island that bore this name. We need not suppose that the stone itself came from Inis Fail; it may have been already on the spot, and have been adapted as the representation of the deity. But Baile an Scdil has something more to say about the stone, which is less easy to explain. It may be remarked parenthetically that this story of the "Spectre's Ecstasy " is to the effect that Conn Cet-chathach stepped one day by hazard on the stone of Fal; that it uttered its scream ; and that the druids Moel, Blocc, and Bluicne explained its meaning to the king. The historical background of the occurrence, the essential point of which is Conn's ignorance of the properties of the stone, is probably the fact that Conn, as grandfather of Cormac, was the founder of a new dynasty under which a new order was fated to hold sway in Temair; but the story itself is completely mythical, being full of impossible magic and mystery. After the druids had prophesied of the virtues of the stone, a theophany of Lug appeared and marshalled before Conn in a prophetic vision the kings that were to reign after him : a sort of anticipation of the procession of kings in Macbeth. Now the druids told Conn that the stone was fated to remain perpetually in the Land of Tailltiu; and that there should be a field of games (i.e. perio dical religious festivals, with sacred games, &amp;c.) at Tailltiu so long as there should be a monarchy in Temair. Also, that the king who on the last day of the feast should not see the stone would be a doomed man (trie) that same year.1 There is a remarkable variant of this story in the Book of Leinster (facs. 9a). According to this passage, the properties of the stone were tested 1 See O'Curry, MS. Materials, p. 618 ; also Zeitschr. celt. Phil., iii, 459. B.I,A. PR0C, VOL. XXXIV., SECT. C, [47]</page><page sequence="114">344 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. by Ou-Chulaind and by his foster Lugaid, and the stone remained obstinately silent under both of them ; nor did it scream thenceforth till Conn stood upon it, when its heart burst from it and flew to Tailltiu, where it still remained, called by the name Gride Fail, " FaTs Heart." Tailltiu was the special sanctuary of Lug, the sun-god, and the games there held had been instituted by him. There must have been some stone there called by the name " FaTs Heart," which was supposed to have come from Temair in some such way. It is quite likely that the king who was responsible for the growth and fruitfulness of the crops might have to repair to the sanctuary of the sun-god periodically to renew his strength; and it may be that the rite which was transacted at his inauguration at the " Stone of Fal" was renewed from time to time for this purpose at the " Heart of Fal." That is the best attempt at an explanation of these two extremely difficult passages which occurs to me. The possibility, referred to on a previous page, that the queens of Temair were buried at Tailltiu may be recalled in this connexion. But the new king is waiting for the god to accept him by means of a scream. This scream requires a section to itself. We may, however, note here the naive explanation of the scream given by Keating and other late writers, that the stone contained a demon which lost its power at the birth of Christ. This is additional testimony in support of the interpretation that sees in Fal a deity. The gods of the older faith are the demons of the new.1 5. The Voice of Fal. How was the voice of Fal produced ? That it was some trick on the part of the druids, or whatever religious functionaries presided at the inauguration ceremonies, may be taken for granted?that is, if there be any truth at all in the tradition of the " scream " of the stone. If there be no truth in it, we may as well renounce all hope of separating truth from falsehood in the early Irish records. I was at one time inclined to guess that the scream was a ventriloquial feat on the part of one of the religious functionaries aforesaid. But I have now a different theory to offer. There is a means of making a noise which has been, and still is, employed in various parts of the world in inauguration ceremonies; and I now proceed to bring forward testimony to show that the same means was employed at Temair: that the " Voice of Fal" was the sound made with the instrument well known to anthropologists as the Bull-roarer. 1 So St. Mochutu of Raithin conjured Satan into a neighbouring pillar-stone ; see Feilire Oengusso, Bradshaw ed., p. 94.</page><page sequence="115">MkCALiSTER?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 345 The bull-roarer is a lath of wood attached to a string and whirled round in a wheel or circle. Descriptions of the instrument and of the noise that it makes are contained in Lang's Custom and Myth, and in Haddon's Study of Man, chap. x. It is used by the primitive populations in Africa, North and South America, and Oceania for a variety of purposes, tabulated in the latter work, to which the reader may be referred for authorities, and for geogra phical and other particulars. In general we may say that these different uses fall into the following groups :? (a) In mysteries, initiation ceremonies, and the like: used (i) as the creden tial of a person of authority; (ii) to summon those who are to take part; (iii) to scare off non-initiates, and especially women ; or (iv) as a sacred noise making instrument in the ceremonies themselves. (b) At funeral ceremonies, to scare off spirits. (c) As a weather-control, to make (i) wind, (ii) rain, or (iii) thunder and lightning. (d) To drive cattle: it appears that the noise terrifies them. In the Malay Peninsula, to imitate the noise of a tiger, and so to scare away elephants. (e) As a hunting and fishing charm. The following beliefs held about it in different places are noted by Haddon, op. cit. (a) That it is a god, and its sound the voice of a god. (b) That playing with it will invite a storm of wind. (c) That any woman seeing it will die (in some places she would be killed, as would a person who showed it to a woman). Children also would die were they to see it. Other misfortunes (floods, scarcity, and the like) are threatened if this prohibition should be broken. The evidence for the use of the bull-roarer in ancient Ireland centres in the personality of a druid or magician known as Mug Euith. This name means " slave of a wheel." As we have already noticed, the prefix Mug gives a theophorous sense to a name, and indicates that the second element of a name in which it occurs is something divine, if not actually a divinity. The " wheel," therefore, is a divine wheel. For a deity Roth, ancestor of a clan, we have evidence in two Ogham stones, &gt;one at Drumloghaa, in Waterford, reading bir maqi mucoi rottais; and the other at Lamogue, Co. Kilkenny, reading (as I have ascertained by a recent visit) severrit (maqi mucoi ro)ttais. The top of the latter stone is [47*]</page><page sequence="116">346 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. broken away, doubtless with intention, showing that the ancestral name was conceived as having pagan associations.1 This Mug Kuith, then, is the servant of a divine wheel, which seems to be conceived as being the ancestor of a sept established in the present counties of Kilkenny and Waterford. From Mug Buith himself the people of Fermoy are alleged to trace their descent. He is credited with the invention, or at least the use3 of an instrument of divination called Both Ramach, an expres sion that can most conveniently be translated " paddle-wheel." Such a name is evidently very suitable for a rotating bull-roarer, and it is noteworthy that the same simile is found at the Antipodes. In Australia, where the bull-roarer is of great importance in initiation ceremonies, women are most carefully excluded from the sight of the sacred instrument. If by accident a woman of the Kurnai tribe should happen to find the head of a bull-roarer that has flown off its cord and been lost, and should ask what it may be, she is told that it is the paddle of Tundun, whose voice had been heard in the ceremonies, who had descended " to make the boys men," and who had dropped it in'his return journey to the sky.2 The first text relating to the Roth Ramach which we may cite is con tained in the account of Tlachtga in Dind-shenchas Erenn. Tlachtga, identified, rightly or wrongly, with the Hill of Ward near Athboy, is certainly an ancient sanctuary. We learn from the text cited (which will be found in full in Revue celtique, xvi, 61) that it derives its name from Tlachtga, daughter of Mug Kuith, and that she and her father went to Simon Magus to learn the world's druidry.3 There she had relations with the three sons of Simon, and there she made " for Trian " (do Triun) the Both Bamach, the Stone in Forcarthu, and the pillar-stone (coirthe) of Cnamchoill. Beturning to the bill called Tlachtga she there bore three sons?Dorb, Cuma, and Muach?from whom are named Mag Duirb, Mag Cuma, and Mag Muaig: "and till their names are forgotten in Ireland, the vengeance of foreigners will not visit it." Like so many other articles in Dind-shenchas Erenn, this description is provokingly allusive. It assumes knowledge on the part of its readers such 1 The alleged Gaulish deity Roth, concerning whom some rather nebulous speculations will be found reviewed in Revue celtique, i, 137, is not here in point, even if there were any convincing proof of his real existence. 2 A. W. Howitt, cit. ap. Haddon, Study of Man, p. 314. The name is spelt Turndun by other authorities. 3 Possibly the tradition of the wisdom-seeking voyage of an actual druid, such as we imagined ante, p. 317.</page><page sequence="117">Macalistek?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 347 as we no longer possess.* There was doubtless some story about the three sons of Tlachtga, and the reason why the memory of the sacred plains that bore their names should guard Ireland from foreign vengeance. This reminds us of the folk-stories which turn on the necessity of keeping some mysterious and outlandish " word of power " in the memory.1 Ireland no longer enjoys the safeguard; the names are totally forgotten, and the plains cannot be identified. Who Trian, for whom Tlachtga made the three fetishes, may have been we do not know; it looks, at least at first sight, as though he were a god: of this, however, I am doubtful. Forcarthu is said to be near Eath coole in Co. Dublin; of several places called Cnamchoill, the spot now called Cleghile, in Co. Tipperary, is usually identified with the place mentioned in our text. A search of the Ordnance map has failed to reveal any standing stone now existing at or near either place. Some further information is to be gleaned from the poem which accom panies the prose text. As reproduced in the Book of Ballymote facsimile, 406 b 12-44, this poem consists of fourteen stanzas. The first names Tlachtga daughter of " the bright Slave of the Eoyal Wheel" (ingen Modha reil Righ-Roigh) as its eponym. The next three stanzas give the names of members of the family of Mug Euith: his father, Fergus of Fal {mac Fergusa Fdil) son of Eos ;2 his mother, Cacht daughter of Caithmiu ;3 his foster, Eoth son of Eigholl, from whom he was called Mug Euith; his sons, Buan and [Fer]corb; his wife, Der-droighen,4 sister of the mother of Cairpre Liffechair of the Corcu Bairdne of Dun Cermna. Especially interesting in this connexion is the name of Mug Euith's mother. She is called " daughter of Caithmiu, king of Britain," in the prose genealogy of Mug Euith, which will be found, inter alia, in the Booh of Ui Maine, 19 v 1. She is therefore a sister of the mysterious Camson, of whom we have heard in connexion with Tephi. The fifth stanza of the poem tells us how Tlachtga went with her father to Simon Magus; and the sixth and seventh tell us of her con nexions with the three sons of Simon, whose names, it appears, were Nero, Cairpeint, and Uetir. The eighth stanza tells us how Tlachtga, in association with Mug Euith and Simon, made the Wheel do Trian nir bo thim, which seems to mean " For Trian who was not feeble," though it gives Us no 1 See on this subject Clodd's Tom Tit Tot, especially chapter ix. 2 Elsewhere Caindeasg mac Firglain, YBL facs. 190 a, BB 266 a. 3 King of the Britons of Man (locc. cit. in previous note). 4 Otherwise Dron, daughter of Oengus Mor mac Echach Lairen (locc. cit. in previous note)?</page><page sequence="118">348 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. enlightenment as to who or what Trian may have been.1 The ninth stanza tells us of the making of the stones of Forcarthu and of Cnamchoill. The tenth warns us that "everyone who shall see it, the rough, hairy (?), surly wheel, shall become blind, everyone who shall hear it shall become deaf, everyone whom it shall touch shall die." This is just the sort of thing that would be said of a bull-roarer in Australia, or in any other region where the instrument is held in reverence. The remaining four stanzas tell of Tlachtga's return, of the birth of her sons, of her death in childbed,2 of the plains named after them, and of their guardianship of Ireland against foreigners, as set forth in the prose text. The transactions of Mug Buith with Simon Magus are further described in two important texts. The first of these, called the Adventures of Mug Buith,3 has already given us some variants in the traditions of his family relationships, but adds little to the subject before us. We learn from it, however, the interesting fact that Mug Kuith was a pupil of Scathach before going to study with Simon Magus. We are also told that he was blind, having lost one eye " slaying a yearling calf at Sliab Elpa in a great snow " (icforba gamna ig S. E. i snechta mor)?a reference to some story not apparently preserved to us; and having lost the other by having made the sun to stand still, so that he made one day of two in Dairbriu (Valentia Island).4 Tlachtga makes no appearance in this story, which is to the effect that, having returned home, blind, after thirty-three years' absence with Simon, he learnt from his attendant that his wife was in his house with a young man. The youth was really his son, now grown up, but Mug Kuith assailed the pair with an axe in jealousy. The second source of information is the prose genealogy of Mug Kuith, to be found in the Book of Ui Maine (as quoted above) and also in Rawl. B 502 facs. p. 157, 36-45. The latter 1 I suspect that a stanza has here been lost at a very early stage in the history of the text. No. 7 tells us of the love that Simon's sons gave to Tlachtga. A stanza following this might have told of some gift that they had presented her with, after which would follow the present eighth stanza. " Tlachtga of the third part [of this gift, whatever it may have been] made the Roth Ramach" along with Mug Ruith and Simon. The following stanza seems to mean that she made the Lia Forcarthain and the pillar of Cnamchoill of the leavings, i.e. of the other two-thirds. This would give a raison d'etre for the intrusion of Simon's sons in the narrative. 2 Omitted in the Rennes ms. of the prose text, but duly mentioned in the Edinburgh MS. 3 YBL facs., p. 190 a; BB facs., p. 266 a. 4 This may be an imitation of the miracle of Joshua, but it appears elsewhere.in Irish legend.

Mug Ruith son of Fergus, from whom are the people of Fermoy, it is he who went to learn druidry to Simon Magus, and it is together the ymade the Roth Ramach, that comes over Europe before the Judgment, in the year before Simon's contention with Paul and with Peter. And for this reason is Europe censured, because a pupil of every nation was with Simon as he con tended with Peter. Cacht daughter of Caithmiu king of the Britons was mother of Mug Ruith.

Here we are introduced to an extraordinary feature of the Roth Eamach? its adaptation to Christian eschatology. But before we examine the texts which display this side of its manifold activities, we must look at a very important entry in Cormac's Glossary. Here the Wheel is actually alluded to under the name of Roth Fail?the Wheel of Fal. This passage will be found in the Glossary under the heading F6i. It is extremely difficult to under stand : here is the original passage? FOI, .i. Cnamchaill, ut dixit Gruibne fili fri Core mac Lugdhach, " in fess fo Foi," .i. ba fessach Cnamchoille. Item u Mog Ruith peribit quod Roth F&amp;il per veniet, dicens co ri Durluis Find * iar Fhoi,' " .i. iar Cnamchaill. The purpose of this entry is to show by illustration that Foi is another name for Cnamchoill?a fact also stated by O'Clery in his Glossary (Revue celtique, iv, p. 421). The reference to Durlas (Thurles) indicates that the Cnamchoill intended is the place now called Cleghile in Tipperary. In support of this explanation of Foi, two passages are quoted: one pf them an obscure line, with which we are not now concerned, from Gruibne the poet; the other a passage from some Latin writing to the effect that Mug Euith will perish because the Wheel of Fal will arrive, saying to the king of White Durlas " after Foi," that is, " after Cn&amp;mehoill."1 In the absence of the context of the Latin extract, it is impossible to make out its meaning fully ; but the association of Mug Euith and Cnamchoill with the Eoth Fail makes it quite clear that the " Wheel of Fal" is one and the same thing as the " Paddle-wheel." We have already seen that the writer of the tract Sil Chonairi Moir says that Fal emitted its noise against a wheel, which he naturally supposed to be the wheel of the chariot. If we can correct him in this, it is because we have the Australian aborigines at our disposal, to show us the right way to interpret these passages. It will not escape notice that the warning that everyone who hears the Eoth Eamach becomes deaf shows that it is something capable of emitting a noise., We have now found the following facts hidden in the confused mass of details about the Eoth Eamach :? i. A certain stone was said to scream against a wheel. ii. There was an instrument called the " wheel" of that stone. iii. It was also called a " a paddle-wheel" ; just as the Australians, on occasion, call the " bull-roarer " an oar. 1 A translation in which some of the words are rendered differently will be found in Rhys, Hibbert Lect., p. 212. Without the context it is impossible to decide which is correct, but the question is here of minor importance.</page><page sequence="121">Maoalistku?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 351 iv. It made a noise. v. It was looked upon as the invention of a prominent druid, or of his daughter. vi. It was looked upon with awe, as a thing dangerous to touch, hear, and see. I claim that these six facts constitute the clearest proof that we have a right to expect, that the Voice of Fal was produced by a bull-roarer. This conclusion is of some importance, as the bull-roarer has not hitherto been identified in any region north of the Alps. In ancient Temair as in modern Australia, at the remotest ends of the earth from one another, the sound of the bull-roarer was used in initiation ceremonies, and was regarded as being the voice of the god. It is perhaps possible to see a reminiscence of the bull-roarer and its destructive powers in the description of the plague that ravaged Britain in the time of Lludd, as related in the story of Lludd and Llefelys: a great shriek that was heard every Beltene-eve over every hearth in Britain; it penetrated the hearts of the people, so that men lost their colour and their strength, women the children in their wombs, boys and girls their reason. Animals, trees, land, water were all barren. The sequel of the story explains this as being the outcry raised by two dragons, which wrere ultimately imprisoned and made harmless in Snowdon. But this may well be a late explanation ; dragons are essentially mediaeval, but a mysterious noise that brought destruction to unauthorized persons that came within its influence is a primitive idea. Such a noise would be the sound of the bull-roarer. It is useless to expend many words on some of the minor details alluded to in the extracts that have been set before the reader. The reference to the " breaking " of the stone of Cnamchoill must point to a lost myth.1 Indeed, it is not very clear, what place the " Stone of Forcarthu " and the " Pillar of Cnamchoill" occupy in the scheme; it is most probable that these were cult centres, similar to Tlachtga, and that the stones were oracular stones similar to Fal. We shall see presently that Fal was by no means the only "speaking stone" in Ireland. That Tlacbtga and Temair were closely connected is indicated by the coincidence of date of the annual sacred fire lighted at these two centres, as we shall see in the following section; and by the fact that ._,_,_._l_,_;_ 1 O'Curry's version, that Mug Ruith used the Wheel as a sort of flying-machine '(MS. Mat., p. 402), with the addendum that *' it met with an accident" (Rhys, Hibbert Lect., 211), explains how there came to be "fragments," but does not rest, so far as I can discover, on any very secure literary evidence. B.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT, C. [48]</page><page sequence="122">352 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Mug Ruith is intermediate in descent between " Fergus of Fal "* and Tlachtga. It is impossible to understand some of the allusions contained in these passages; and we are inclined to suspect that the writers had not a very clear idea themselves of the meaning of what they were writing. The Roth Ramach must have figured more conspicuously in the earliest Irish literature than the surviving fragments of that literature would lead us to suppose; and there must have been a number of tales related of it and of its wonder-working powers. When the bull-roarer was forgotten, scribes racked their brains to imagine what the " Paddle-wheel " might have been, and they concluded that it was some sort of a ship that flew in the air. I ts destructiveness to those who meddled with it showed that it was something dangerous; and before long we find it has become a terrible, destructive instrument which will sweep over the world in general, and Ireland in particular, at or before the Day of Judgment. In their desire to invent apocalyptic horrors, the Christian eschatologists drew on the resources of ancient pagan tradition. The reason why Europe is to be visited with this plague has already been seen ; it is because there was a representative from every nation at the school of Simon Magus, all of whom were involved with him in his contest with the Apostles. But another and more heinous crime blackened the record of Mug Ruith, on which account Ireland is to suffer especially from the " Paddle wheel." The Booh of Ui Maine contains two poems (so-called) on the subject of the execution of St. John the Baptist. One of these, which will be found at fo. 152 b, 1 (pencil pagination),2 relates the familiar story of the Baptist's reproval of Herod, Salome's dancing, and the demand for the Baptist's head as a reward. The other poem (fo. 66 a, b), which has been edited by Miss Scarre in Eriu, iv 173. also relates the story, with a number of extra-Biblical inter polations, including an interminable dispute between members of the royal family. Both poems imply (the first indeed definitely asserts) that no one in Ascalon (sic!) could be found to execute the impious sentence, till they came to Mug Ruith, who for a reward undertook to act as executioner. 1 Is this Fergus the same person as the brother of Starn and Iarbonel ? (p. 295). And is he the person after whom "Bod Fheargais " and the Cross of Fergus were named 1 We need not trouble ourselves with prosaic questions of chronology in dealing with a pedigree that brings into close contact a sister of the abductor of Tephi, a pupil of Simon Magus, and the mother of Cairbre Liffechair ! The facts (which we learn from YBL facs. 190 a 22, and a parallel passage in BB 266 a) that Mug Ruith learned the art of war from Scathach, while further complicating the chronology, is suggestive in connexion with what has been said on p. 323. 2 Printed in a much abbreviated form from an Edinburgh ms. by Professor Mackinpon in Celtic Review, viii, 168.</page><page sequence="123">Macalijsteu? Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 353 When we read an extravagance like this, our first impulse is to ask helplessly with Geronte, Que diablr allait-il faire dans cette galerel?and then to pass on to some other study which promises to be a less dismal waste of time. But when we look at the eschatological literature, to which reference was just now made, we are tempted to take a second, glance at the story. For this literature consistently affirms that the trouble is to fall on Ireland on St. John's Day, in revenge for the death of the Baptist. There must therefore have been a real tradition at the basis of these poems, which in some way connected Ireland with the crime of Herod. The " Paddle-wheel" is sometimes associated with, sometimes superseded by, another instrument of vengeance in these prophecies of judgment to come. This is called the Scuap a Fanait, which must be translated " The Broom from Fanad," however we are to interpret the expression. We have even less materials for determining the nature of the Scuap a Fanait than we have for the Roth Ramach. That it likewise played a large, and to the early Christian writers unintelligible, part in Irish literature is perhaps indicated, inter alia, by the fact that it seems to have suggested to Colcu ua Dunechda the strange title Scuap Ghrdbaid, " Broom of Devotion," for the prayer composed by him.1 The "Broom from Fanad " may have been an instrument of pagan worship, like the Roth Eamach: but the expression might well mean a rushing or whirling wind, supposed to have been raised by magic; if the druids were not wind-raisers and rain-makers, they knew little of the craft of the medicine-man. The raising of magical winds is a conspicuous element in the story of the landing of the children of Mil in Ireland, as related in Lebor Gabala. But why Fanad ? What has this remote Donegal promontory to do with magical winds in the rest of the country ? It can hardly be explained merely as another way of saying "a north wind." Such an explanation strikes us at once as insufficient. We may possibly find the clue in a Teutonic myth, which also associates the Baptist with a mighty wind.2 It appears that Herodias, who is here treated not as Herod's wife, but as bis dancing daughter, is " placed at the head of the ' furious hosts,' or of witches' nightly expeditions, together with Diana, with Holda and Perahta (Berchta), or in their stead." We further learn that Herodias " is reverenced by the third part of humanity" (op. cit., p. 284), and that "from midnight 1 Published in Otia Merseiana, ii, 92.

Academy. till first cockcrow she sits on oaks and hazel trees, the rest of her time she floats through the empty air. She was inflamed by love for John, which he did not return; when his head was brought in on a charger, she would fain have covered it with tears and kisses, but it draws back and begins to blow hard at her; the hapless maid is whirled into empty space, and there she hangs for ever." As Grimm rightly says, this reference to the turbo or whirlwind "looks mythical and of high antiquity." Further it is quite clear that he is correct in saying " the Christian my thus [siv] of Herodias got mixed up with our native heathen fables." Herodias therefore, who is connected thus with the Baptist and with a whirlwind, stands in the place of a Teutonic wind divinity. Grimm shows by a number of passages, for which reference may be made to the original work, that in Teutonic mythology Herodias, borrowed from Christian lore, is identical with Diana, borrowed from classical lore, and again with Holda, Frau Holda, or Pharaildis, the native Teutonic skyT and fertility-goddess. Though Holda is as a rule a benign being, pre siding over and rewarding the various branches of human industry, yet she rides with witches and is not unconnected with storms and whirlwinds (op. cit. ii, 883). But'we may perhaps venture a step farther. Grimm (op. cit. i, 287) quotes a passage from the Roman de la Rose relating to a certain Dame Habonde or Domina Abundia, a domestic deity who increased the riches of the dwellings which she frequented. Of this lady the Roman de la Rose says:? Dautre part, que li tiers du monde aille ainsinc avec Dame Habonde? showing that Abundia and the being whose place Herodias has usurped are one. Abundia, therefore, is a goddess of fertility, who is in some way associated with whirlwinds on St. John's Day. May we see this name buried in the cryptical Scuap a Eanaid? I suggest that " Fanad " is the guess of some lustofiographer trying to make sense of a word to him incomprehensible. iWhat he had J before him^ in the exemplar which he ,wflfi. studying, was not Scuap a Fanaitl but ^oxaethihg like Scuap Afanait?a corruption (or rather the end of a long series of corruptions) of Turbo Abundiae. At least* I offer this rasa first attempt at explaining something that has never yet been explained.,_ Some of the eschatological literature may now be summarized as briefly as possible. The Scuap a Fanait is to destroy the men of Ireland on the feast of St. John, in vengeance for the death of the Baptist (Fcilire Oengusso, Lebor</page><page sequence="125">Macalister?Temair Breg ; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 355 Brecc Glosses).1 The descriptions of the plague there given would suit a rushing wind. According to the strange prophetic tract called Immacallam in da Thuarad one of the signs of the coming end of the age is to be a "conflict round Cnamchoill,"2 which the Eawlinson MS. explains in a gloss thus: "the Eoth Eamach will proceed till it will be in contact with Cnamchoill." Among the writings of the prophecy-mongers who compiled lists of portents in the names of Adamnan, Colum Cille, and Moling, the Eoth Eamach figures conspicuously; a collection of allusions to it will be found in O'Curry's Manuscript Materials (references sub voce " Eoth Eamhach " in index). Putting these together, we gather that they understood the Eoth Eamach to be a sort of ship3 which was to sail out of Cnamchoill; and that it was to be associated with a "fiery dart " which was to destroy a large number of the men of Ireland on St. John Baptist's Day, and with the Scuap a Fanait, which was also to work much mischief. Even when the magical instruments are not mentioned, the Feast of St. John the Baptist is indicated as a time when evils may be expected; see for example in Adamnan's Second Vision, published in Revue celtique xii, at page 424. In the Dindshenchas of Crotta Cliach (Revue celtique xv 440) the affliction takes the shape of a dragon. It is noteworthy, for a reason that will presently appear, that Adamnan's " Prophecy " tells us that " a flame of fire swift as a blast of wind " is to kill three-fourths of the men, women, boys, and girls of Ireland in the twinkling of an eye. All this mass of seemingly incoherent nonsense becomes intelligible when we remember that St. John Baptist's day is Midsummer day, and that all over Christendom the saint has entered on the heritage of the Midsummer rites of Pagandom. In these prophecies of judgment to come, with this clue in hand, we can discern the fragments of a lost folk-tale, told to children in ancient Ireland to warn them against meddling with things that do not concern them. Our interpreters, the Australians, once more come to our assistance. The Kurnai of Gippsland have a story to the effect that once upon a time " some children of the Kurriferi, playing about, found a bull-roarer, which they took home to the camp and showed the women. Immediately the earth crumbled away, and it was all water, and the Kurnai were drowned/'4 This is the 1 Bradshaw edition, p. 190. August 29. 2 See Bevue celtique, xxvi, 47, for the text. 3 O'Curry, in his ms. catalogue of manuscripts in the Royal Irish Academy Library, speculates , on the possibility of the Roth Ramach being a prophecy of a steamer's paddle-wheel ! Nicholas O'Kearney seems to have had no doubt of this. 4 Quoted from Rev. L. Fison in Lang's Custom and Myth, p. 35 ; also Haddon, op. cit., p. 310.</page><page sequence="126">356 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy* Kurnai version of the universal deluge-myth; it also contains a warning of what will happen again should anyone show a bull-roarer to a woman. With this in mind, it is not difficult to reconstruct, at least in outline, the Irish tale on which the prophecies quoted above are based : it would run somewhat as follows :? " Once upon a time there was a Midsummer corroboree at Cnamchoill. Mug Kuith was there, swinging the bull-roarer. The voice of the Bull-roarer is the voice of Fal, and whoever sees it without authority becomes blind, whoever hears it becomes deaf, whoever touches it dies. But some profane person was there, and he.So waters broke forth, and lightning flashed, and there came a powerful whirlwind, and three-fourths of those who were there perished." We have to leave a blank in the middle, as it is useless to speculate on what the particular prohibition might have been in Ireland, the breach of which caused the catastrophe; this would naturally differ in different surroundings. But it may well have been, as in Australia, an exclusion of women. The connexion of Tlachtga with the wheel does not necessarily rule this out; for the Kurnai have two bull-roarers?one large, called tundun; the other small, called riikut tundun, "Tundun's wife";1 yet women are excluded from so much as the sight of them both. There may have been two bull-roarers in Ireland, one connected with the magician Mug Ruith, and the other with his daughter Tlachtga ; and possibly we may see a hint at an exclusion of women even from the smaller instrument in the mysterious reference to Tlachtga's breaking of the Roth Ramach. I am inclined to believe that Mug liuith is rather the name of an official than of a person : that the " Servant of the Wheel" was the particular druid to whom the duty of swinging the bull-roarer on ceremonial occasions was entrusted. A passage in Keating (History, I. T. S. edition, ii, 320) bears this out. Mug Ruith is here introduced as a water-finder, and we are told that he lived during the reigns of nineteen kings: a passage most easily explained by supposing that the functionary called " Mug Ruith " was referred to in various records relating to these reigns, and that the " official historians" mistook it for a personal name. In the passage in Keating we are told that Mug Ruith thre\# into the air a magic spear (ga geintlidhe), and where it fell a spring of water burst forth. Is this ^ record of the use of 4he divining rod? " ' ' F We now see the significance of the statement that St. Ibar was "like John the Baptist." Before the saint who founded the monastery came to Beg Eire, that island was the scene of Midsummer ceremonies. 1 Howitt, quoted in Haddon, op. dt., p. 313.</page><page sequence="127">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 357 Fal was not the only " speaking stone" that Ireland possessed. The glosses to FdUire Oengusso, which contain so much valuable folk-lore material, under the date 15 August, tell us of a stone at Clogher. Co. Tyrone, adorned with gold and silver, called Cermand Cestach, that is, apparently, Cermand of the Questions?a suitable name for an oracle-giver. Out of this stone, says the note, a demon used to speak?just as Keating tells us a demon spoke out of the stone of F&amp;l; and, on the testimony of the glossator, it was still to be seen in the form of a short stone on the right-hand side as one entered Clogher Cathedral. The marks of the "joints of gold and silver" with which it was decorated were still visible when the note was written. There is a stone now standing near the cathedral, supposed locally to be the stone referred to. I have not seen it, but to judge from a description, with a sketch, that has been most kindly sent me by the Rev. J. E. M'Kenna, P.P., M.H.I.A., I feel sure that it cannot be the original stone, but (as he suggests) a block?a lintel or sill-stone, perhaps ?from some of the predecessors of the present cathedral building. Now another " idol" of Ireland was decorated with gold. This was the figure called variously Cromm Cruaich and Cenn Cruaich; and when we notice that the name Cermand is merely what the late Lewis Carroll called a " portmanteau word," made up of the alternatives Cromm and Cenn, we are led to infer that the deity so styled was represented by the stone of Clogher. That St. Patrick's Cromm was a speaking stone may be inferred from the name of the " water " near it, Guth Ard, to which reference has already been made; and it is curious that in the description of the prostrations before Cromm Cruaich, in which king Tigernmas met his death, we are told that " three-fourths of the men, women, boys, and girls of Ireland died "?the same expression that Adamnan is made to use in the prophecy attributed to him. The pillar of Cnamchoill and the stone of Forcarthu?the latter perhaps a lam-dia or small hand-stone?were very likely other oracular stones of the same kind. The well-known Cloch Labhrais in Stradbally parish, Co. Water ford,1 and whatever stone gave its name to Clolourish townland in the neighbourhood of Enniscorthy2 ?itself called after a standing stone, whether the same or some other?may also have been oracular stones, worked in the same way as Fal. A Christian analogy to these oracular stones may be quoted from the Lismore Life of St. Patrick.3 The stone on which St. Patrick was born was wont to shed tears when a false oath was pronounced over it. 1 See Power's Place-names of the Decies, p. 174, for this stone and its legend, 3 Joyce's Social History, i, 277. 3 JkL Stokes, line 50.</page><page sequence="128">358 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy., Cromm Cruaich is called, in the various well-known versions of St. Patrick's encounter with him, "King-idol of adoration." If, as seems likely from the foregoing comparisons, we are to equate Cromm to Fal, this expression will become more intelligible; for, as we have already seen, "king" is one of the meanings which the glossators attach to the word Fal. That he ever seriously bore the name Cromm Cruaich I greatly doubt. The translation of the name is uncertain, depending on whether we are to adopt Cruaich or Cruaeh as the form of the second word. In the former case, " crooked one of the mound,'' or "worm of the mound," might be the meaning: in the latter case, "crooked-gory," or "gory-worm," might be intended.1 In either case, the name is more probably a nickname given to the god in contempt. The two variants, Cromm Crua(i)ch and Cenn Crua(i)ch, seem to survive in popular recollection in "Raw-head" and " Bloody-bones " (turning Cromm to Cndmh), two nursery bogies of a less refined past generation. This would favour the renderings involving cro, gore; on the other hand, the form of the name which we find in two late "Ossianic" poems is in favour of the " mound " rendering. These are Crom na Cairrge2 and Crom ni Came.3 It is curious that though it was never forgotten that "Crom" was a god? rites in his honour continued down to the last century on Garland Sunday, the Sunday before (or after) Lug-nasad, in Co. Clare4?yet efforts were made to euhemerise him. A story to be found in the Book of Lismore6 and in the Book of Fermoy (62 b 1) makes him a man, who from the day of his birth was the humble servant of a crowd of demons in all sin and bad manners, but whose soul at his death was rescued from their clutches by St. Patrick. A modern folk-tale (Revue celtique, iv, 175) makes him a servant of St. Patrick. Compare the first tale in Hyde's Legends of Saints and Sinners. And though the bull-roarer was forgotten, and the references to it mis understood, yet it too lived on in folk-memory. Dr. Haddon6 tells pf how a boy in Co. Down playing with a bull-roarer, noW: degenerated to a rustic toy, was reproved by an old woman, who told him that "he was meddling with a sacred thing"; and Andrew Lang, in his article .on the Bull-roarer in 1 The analogy that has been drawn between Cenn Cruaich and the Brythonic Penno crucium (Revuerveltique, xxvii, 316) seems to me doubtful. It assumes an identical form of worship among the Brythonic tribes, which must first be proved. 2 Ossianic Soc.

The last event of the inauguration was the gairm rig, the proclamation or acknowledgment of the royalty of the new king. Some passages bearing on this act will be found referred to in the note in Meyer's edition of Gath Finntrdga, p. 82 ; but the locus elassicus is certainly the curious paragraph in the Life of Colman mac Luachdin, in which the saint is conferring a reward on one of his followers.1 The whole incident is very remarkable and worth summarizing briefly. Conall Guthbind king of Meath had killed Mael-Odrdn, a refugee with Colman. Colman said, " Let the earth swallow up the horses and chariots of the island whence thou hast come " ;2 and so it fell out. Conall came to slay Colman, but was driven astray by a magic mist. He fell into the hands of his enemies Blathmac and Diarmait, kings of Temair, but escaped from them, only to fall into the power of Mael-Umae, a relative and tenant of Colman. Mael-Umae slew him; Conall uttered a dying curse that every king who held Temair should revenge his, Conall's, death upon Mael-Umae. Mael-Umae came and reported the matter to Colmdn, who revoked the curse, substituting the blessing?that to Mael-Umae and his descendants should be the privilege of proclaiming the gairm rig over every new king in Temair. Here an unknown glossator has drawn a pen-picture of the scene in the margin of his MS.; the note has become incorporated with the text, but is easily separated from it. He describes the king " standing at the foot of Gaii the na nGiall," that is, of course, Lia Fail; and the herald " standing on a flagstone below." Of this flagstone we do not hear elsewhere, but that is no reason why it should not have existed. It reminds us not a little of Saxo's3 statement that " the ancients, when they were to choose a king, were wont to stand on stones planted in the ground, and to proclaim their votes, in order to foreshadow from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would be 1 Todd Lectures, vol. xvii, p. 72. 3 Is cett doibsin talam dia slncud?an idiomatic expression for an imperative, not a permissive.

The herald then utters the words which were probably the established formula?Rigi ocus airechus hErenn duit, a ri! " Thine the kingship and lordship of Ireland, 0 king" ! Then a remarkable thing happens. The king (a) utters a curse, and (b) makes a cast of a spear at the herald, who (c) defends himself " with an unbound horsewhip" (echlasc gan imiadad). This has every appearance of being an otherwise unrecorded incident in the ritual, which the glossator has adapted to the special case before him. The formula of the curse is " Uodercc ort-sa ! An tuccais Conall Guthbind let?" "hast thou brought Conall Guthbind with thee ? "?an inquiry altogether meaningless if read in connexion with the story to which it is fitted; but at least as intelligible as the majority of analogous formulae if we remember that the herald has just been speaking and acting in the part of a divine being who is guth-bind, " of melodious voice." As to uodercc ort-sa, which Kuno Meyer in his edition of the text has not attempted to interpret, may it not mean " The Red Cow upon thee !"?an invocation of a rival and therefore hostile totemic deity, the sacred cows of Temair being white. But why should the king attack the herald ? There is a sort of parallel to this singular rite in the inauguration of the kings of LTganda. After the ceremonies there were ended, " two men were brought forward blindfolded, one of whom the king shot slightly with an arrow, who was thereupon sent to Bunyoro as ' scapegoat' with the remains of the sacred fire from the royal hut; the second man was liberated."1 A more complete explanation may be arrived at, however, if we start with the weapon with which the herald defends himself. I had missed the enormous significance of the horsewhip, which I had supposed to be the cord of the bull-roarer. But Air. Cook reminded me that the king was now, after the completion of the rites, a divine horse; so that the horsewhip was an appropriate weapon for the herald to use. This does not however explain why the herald should be thus called upon to defend himself. But let the reader now turn back to the skeleton of the epic poem, in which the beliefs underlying these rites were systematized, and he will see that Eochu Oll-athair (or whatever name we may choose for the demi-god founder of the monarchy) had, or seems to have had, another function besides that of a producer of fertility. He was a chthonic deity, Dis Pater, god of the dead. The first thing that the new king does, as soon as he is made a god, is to strike with the devouring spear of death the nearest living creature that he comes in contact with. The herald so iTnroSa/iot; subdues the death-horse with the most appropriate weapon, a horsewhip. 1 Roscoe, The Baganda, p. 200. I am indebted to Sir James Frazer for calling my attention to this passage.</page><page sequence="131">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara 361 In a word, this very interesting " footnote " preserves for us the descrip tion of what was probably the most primitive rite of the whole series of inauguration ceremonies. We think of the cults which centred in Phigaleia, of the chthonic horse Poseidon who wooed Demeter in the form of a mare, and whose taming is represented on certain gems.1 The underlying idea is the same in Arcadia as at Temair?the god of death must be subdued, before he cau begin to be a god of life. The Red Cow (if my suggested translation of the curse be correct) would most likely have been also a chthonic animal-god. It may be asked why there is no mention of this singularly interesting part of the ceremony in the tract Sil Chonairi. The reason probably is, that it is not really part of the inauguration rite. It is the first action of the king after his apotheosis. 6.?The Gods and the Cults of Temair. " Seldom is the sovereignty gained without battles and conflicts; but in the end it is beautiful and goodly." So said the hag, the impersonation of the sovereignty of Ireland, to the youthful Niall, afterwards to be named from his troop of hostages. The man, chosen by the dreams of him who has assimilated the divine bull, made one with the divine horse, reborn, through the stone monuments of the dead and doubtless deified druids, into a life divine, has been led up to Fell. Fal has spoken and has accepted him. The succession, broken by the untoward event of the natural death of the previous king, has once more begun. The new king, no longer a man but a god, is to enjoy his office till a day shall come when a stronger man than he shall arrive, to wrest the divine spark from him and to reign as god-king on earth in his stead. Meanwhile he must carefully guard his divinity. The tract Tecosca Cormaic sets forth the idea of kingly duty, as understood in the ninth century?founded, doubtless, on older traditions. Its prescriptions can be divided into (a) common place morality, as firmness without anger, patience without strife, &amp;c; (b) duties stich as were special to the Irish organization, as hostages in fetters, manifold sureties, fasting on neighbouring territories, exalting privileged persons, forfeiture of sea-waifs, silken raiment; (d) duties as a surety of good crops, as fertility during his reign, mast on trees, fish in creeks, earth fruitful. So the Triads2 count as the three qualifications of a king, treaties with other kings, the Assembly of Temair, and abundance during his reign. Again, in the 1 See Mr. Cook's article on Animal Wer&amp;ip in the Mycenaean Age in Journal of Hellenic Studies, xiv, especially pp. 138-150. 2 Todd Lectures, xiii, 26. [49*]</page><page sequence="132">362 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy. Tecosca Cormaic1 the characteristics of a good chief are set forth. In the very first place of this long list comes rop so-geis, " let him be well furnished with gessa." He is hedged round with a number of restrictions, designed to protect his divinity from injury, and from injuring others. These restrictions, called in the native literature gessa, it now becomes our duty briefly to study. The word geis is sometimes translated tabu. The translation is not strictly exact. A tabu, properly speaking, has the implication of a reserved privilege, which does not necessarily belong to a geis. A geis is a precept, positive or negative; differing, however, from an ordinary precept in that it applies, not to the community at large, but to an individual or to a group of individuals. As examples of these different kinds of regulations, we may take the following instances from contemporary life:?" Only members admitted " is a tabu, against non-members, in favour of members. " .No smoking allowed here " is a precept, in this case negative, differing from a geis in that it is universal. As an example of a positive geis we may cite the military regulation which requires officers to travel first-class on railways. A good example of a negative geis is the rule preventing members of the peerage, or clergymen, from holding seats in the House of Commons.2 " Officers must travel first-class " [other people being at liberty to please themselves] is a geis. " No one but officers may travel first-class" [other people being prohibited from doing so] would be a tabu. One of the most curious and perplexing phenomena in all Irish literature is the power, nowhere explained, which people seem to have possessed of imposing gessa on others. Grainde puts a geis " of the ridge of druidry," i.e. apparently, a particularly strong and binding geis, on Diarmait to elope with her ; and Diarmait is obliged to do so, though it is much against his will. It is obvious that all human relations would have been impossible had the process been so simple as is described. Grainde must have done something else, which the sense of propriety felt by the Christian chronicler prevented him from recording?performed a gesture, secured some magical instrument, or what-not?in order to make her gessa effective.3 The invaluable tract called Lebor na ccert preserves to us the gessa which hedged the life and the deity of the king of Temair. Though this document 1 Todd Lectures, xv, pp. 2, 12. 2 At first sight this would appear indistinguishable from a tabu, against peers and clergy, in favour of commoners. The difference however is essential. In a tabu a majority of the whole community is excluded from a certain action or privilege. In a negative geis a minority of the community is thus excluded. 3 There is however a curious parallel in Melanesia, whereby A can compel B to do something which he is unwilling to do, by referring to the head of a third person who is in certain definite ways related to B : see Rivers, A History of Melanesian Society, i, 44.</page><page sequence="133">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 363 is late, dating from the tenth century, it preserves to us, especially in its opening section, much that is extremely primitive. It may be likened to a telescope, through which we look back far into the early days of our savage ancestors, long anterior to the beginning of written record ; and we thus learn something about their ways of thought. According to this document the king of Temair was not allowed? (1) To let the sun rise on him in his bed in Temair. (2) To alight in Mag Breg on Wednesday. (3) To cross Mag Cuillind after sunset. (4) To slaughter1 his horses in Fan Chomair. (5) To come on Tuesday to Northern Tethba. (6) To go on a ship on Monday after Beltene. (7) To leave the track of a host on Ath Maigne on Tuesday after Saruain. It is obvious that the greater number of the above restrictions are excerpts from an elaborate calendar of dies nefasti, other fragments of which are to be found in the lists of gessa on the provincial kings contained in the same tract. What evil influences were abroad on Mag Breg on the third day of the lunar phase, or on Mag Cuillind after sunset, or in Northern Tethba on the second day of the lunar phase, we are unable to say ; possibly these were holy days and holy places of the aboriginal and therefore rival religion. That such creed-exclusiveness was part of the scheme is shown very clearly by the gessa of the king of the Ulaid, which are by far the easiest to understand. These included (1) presence at Echras Ratha Line among the warriors of Dal nAraide; (2) listening to the fluttering of birds of Lind Sailech after sunset?clearly because these bird-flights were oracular; (3) partaking of the feast of the flesh of the bull of Daire mac Daire, that is to say, the ceremonial eating of the flesh of the bull-god better known as Dond Cualnge; (4) coming on Mag Coba in March ; and (5) drinking of the water of Bd Nemid (the cow of Nemed, the legendary leader of the aboriginal tribes to Ireland) between two darknesses, i.e. in the daytime. It is plain that the king of the Ulaid had. to be especially careful to guard his divinity uncontaminated from aboriginal rites in the northern province, where the Pictish tribes were more closely concentrated. The Dal nAraide were a pre-Celtic people, and they presumably had a sacred assembly at Echras2 Ratha Line ; and in the prohibition of the bull-feast of Dond Cualnge and of the well of the aboriginal sacred cow we see other indications of the war of pre Celtic and of Celtic creeds. 1 Slaidi a each. O'Donovan, who presumably could not guess why the king of Temair should slaughter his horses under any circumstances, gives the milder rendering " incite." 2 O'Donovan translates this word '* horse-fair," which is hardly exact.</page><page sequence="134">364 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. This digression is of service to our present purpose, for the Ulidian pro hibitions most clearly enable us to understand that these lists of gessa belong to the dominant Celtic peoples, and that the actions which they are designed to prevent belong to the religion of the aboriginal tribes* Returning to the Temair prohibitions, we remark that the first is not a little reminiscent of the prohibition which forbade the Mikado of Japan from going into the open air, because the sun was not worthy to shine upon him.2 The sun must not shine on the king in his bed?he must not expose his sacred body, deshabille*, to the touch of its rays. It is worthy of note that the Monday after Beltene, the first of May, and the Tuesday after the pre ceding Samain, the first of November, always fall on the same day of the month, except when the intercalary day of a leap-year intervenes*, as though naval expeditions on a certain day after Beltene, and military expeditions on the same day after Samain, were forbidden. The reference to the horse sacrifice is especially interesting. The horse would necessarily, as a totem, be a sacred animal, only to be sacrificed on extraordinary occasions, such as the inauguration of a new monarch; the king must therefore lend no countenance to an aboriginal sacrifice of this animal which took place, presumably annually, at Fan Chomair. We may suppose this locality, now unfortunately unknown, to have been a sanctuary of some pre-Celtic horse divinity. Beside these restrictions on his liberty, the king enjoyed the following privileges. These were, it is now unnecessary to point out, the true tabus? the things set apart for the king's use. (1) The fish of Boyne, (2) The deer of Luibnech, (3) The harvest of Manann, (4) The sloes of Bri Leith, (5) The cresses of Brosna, (fi) The water of Tlachtga; (7) The game of N&amp;s, 1 At least, in some cases. In others, the geis is designed to prevent the repetition of some action which when performed had been followed by misfortune. Ageis with com plicated detail, such as that which forbade the king of Cruachu '* to race with the rider of a grey one-eyed horse in Ath Glallta between t\V6 hurdles," can only nTfeaii fcnat a king of Cruachu once really did the deed specified: something untoward happened afterwards: on the principle post hoc ergo propter hoc, the king's action was supposed to be the cause of the misfortune: and as it was not certain which of the details of the action- had offended the Powers, the whole complicated crime was minutely specified to guard against its being committed again. 2 Frazer, Taboo ami the Perih of the Soul, p. 3, quoting Kaempfer's Japan (1727).</page><page sequence="135">Macalistek?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 365 and, according to the poem of Civan 6 Lothchain, which enumerates these tabus, his partaking of these dainties, which were brought to the king on the Calends of August, secured fruitfulness in the earth, victory in battle, and wisdom in counsel.1 Mr. A. B. Cook has already discussed these tabus.2 In addition to the important points wThich he there brings forward, and which it is unnecessary here to repeat, a possible connexion may be drawn between the Boyne, the river of the white cow, on the bank of which is situate the cemetery of the kings, and the well of the white cow. at Temair. Luibnech is doubtless the place of that name near Gorey, in Wexford, chiefly remarkable as the retreat of Finnachta, who in the ninth century abandoned the kingship of Connacht in order to take up the life of a hermit at this place. According to the curious story of the Ecstasy of Finnachta3 he was assisted by certain wild cattle in the task of building his church, which seems to indicate a tradition that the cattle of this place possessed a supernatural character. There is nothing to prove the sanctity of Brosna, so far as I know, except the passage before us, which however leaves it beyond doubt. That the water of Tlachtga should be sacred to the king of Temair will be intelligible after what we have already learnt about that place, and the druidess from which it was said to have derived its name. These gessa and tabus are in themselves quite sufficient to prove that the king of Temair was a god incarnate: after the work that has been done on kindred subjects by Frazer, which has already been applied to the case before us by Cook and by Baud is, there can be no possible doubt on this subject. But the question remains, what god was supposed to take up his abode in the body of the king ? Probably a simple answer can hardly be given to this question. What has already been said would seem to show that even in primitive times there was a complicated variety of religions and of cults meeting at Temair. But some light is available on this question from a consideration of the Assemblies which at stated intervals were convened on the ridge, and especially from the time of the year at which they were held. The association of a good king with good crops, and of a bad king with bad crops, would lead us prima facie to expect that the king was an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation. This is confirmed by the dates of the Temair assemblies. The Assemblies, the technical term for which is fiis or oenach, were a prominent feature in the religious life of ancient Ireland. The chief centres 1 .Le&amp;or na ccert, ed. O'Donovan, pp. 8, 9. * Folk-lore, xvii, 162. 3 Yellow Book of Lecan. facs. 191 a ; Book of Bally mote, facs. 260 b.</page><page sequence="136">366 Proceedings of the Royal I?ish Academy. where they were held were at Temair, Tailltiu, Carman, Tlachtga, and LTisnech. There were minor local festivals in other centres as well. It is noteworthy that these assemblies do not seem to have been confined to the tribes in whose territories their sites were situated, but were conventions of the whole country. This point is worth noticing, for it is often erroneously stated that there was no sense of unity in the country at large until it was imposed from without. In point of fact, though it would lead us too far from our present subject to enlarge on this topic, it is not difficult to detect traces of an underlying sense of unity throughout the whole history, obscured to the superficial observer by the endless wars of rival tribes. One of the strongest unifying forces was this system of periodical religious assemblies. We may perhaps compare the influence of the Delphian Amphictyony in developing a Pan-Hellenic instinct among the disunited states of Greece. The centres of the greater assemblies were all pre-eminent cemeteries; but it would be rash to assume that therefore the assemblies were primarily convened for the worship of the dead. The assemblies may have been the cause of the choice of site for the cemetery, not vice versa. On the other hand, there is evidence that an assembly-mound was presumably a burial mound : thus the Fiana, sitting on the assembly-mound beside Sescenn na nAiged, ask their leader, as a matter of course, "Who is the warrior on whose grave we are ? "x Moreover, we have seen that some of the most important religious buildings at Temair were designed so as to incorporate a mound that has all the appearance of being a tumulus. We cannot assume that the purpose of the assemblies, and their religious rites, were identical at the different sites. Different assemblies were in honour of different deities, as is shewn by the fact that they occurred on different days of the year. The assembly of Uisnech fell on Beltene, that of Tailltiu n Lugnasad, that of Temair on Sainain.2 Carman was a Lugnasad festival,3 and Tlachtga a Samain celebration.4 This means that Temair and Tlachtga are to be classed together, as we might have expected. Similarly Carman and Tailltiu are to be classed together. Lug-nasad is some sort of festival of Lug, the sun-god?possibly the feast of the marriage of the sun-god and his consort (earth or moon): these places, therefore, are sun-shrines. We have already seen that it is on Lug-nasad that the king of Temair received the victuals which were tabu to him, and so far we may admit an acknowledgment of the sun-god. Doubtless, one of his duties was to make 1 Fiannuigecht, in Todd Lect. Series, xvi, 54, 2 Silva Gadelica* i, 73 ; ii, 77. 3 Metrical Dind-shenchas, Todd Lect, x, pp. 18, 19. 4 Keating's Foras Feasa ar Fhinn (I.T.S. ed.), ii, p. 246,</page><page sequence="137">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 367 the sun shine as long and as brightly as he conveniently could; and it may perhaps be guessed that a certain talisman, called the Roth Chroi, described as a golden brooch that was passed from king to king,1 was an amulet for this purpose.2 But the main festival of Temair was not a solar festival. It was the feast of the beginning of winter, when the annual death of the spirit of vegetation was solemnly celebrated. This being so, we might expect that the re-birth of the same being should be celebrated at or near the vernal equinox. And by rare good fortune we have evidence that this occasion also was a solemn festival at Temair. The evidence is afforded us by the well-known story of St. Patrick's proceedings at Temair on the Easter after his arrival in the country as a missionary. * It is needless to do more than to remind the reader that he lit the Paschal fire in full view of Temair, before the sacred fire was there kindled: a sacrilege so serious that the penalty was death. But the question of the authenticity of this story, which has been attacked by scholars of weight, is one which it is important to consider before we proceed to deduce anything from it. While the undignified display of magic, with which the saint is said to have confounded the king's druids, is doubtless a legendary accretion,31 see no reason against accepting the story in its main lines. The druidic prophecy of the coming of the " shave-pates " required no supernatural anticipation of the future. Druidry had been suppressed in Gaul, and was eclipsed in Britain ; but it still flourished in Ireland, and we may suppose that many persecuted druids from overseas found there a sanctuary. From these refugees the druids of King Loeguire would have heard of the strange religion whose ritual is so naively described in the quatrain ascribed to them. It would only be a matter of time before the " shave-pates " would make their way to Ireland; and the druids sought to warn the king in time to suppress the new teaching, which would inevitably threaten their own supremacy, so soon as it appeared. Their recognition of the Paschal fire, also, needed no miraculous insight. The druids doubtless knew that Patrick had already arrived in Ireland and was making 1 Revue celtique, xx, 138, 421. 3 Gro means a fence, and it may perhaps be no mere coincidence that this object bore a name with the same apparent meaning as Roth Fdil. In any case it was a thing so sacred that the bardic demand for its surrender was the last straw which broke the patience of Aed mac Ainmirech, and determined that king to abolish the bardic order. 3 One of the druids was said to have been caught up into the air and dashed to the ground. This was the legendary fate of Simon Magus, who has an indirect connexion with the Temair traditions through Mug Ruith: the tradition is probably responsible for the " flying-machine " conception of the Roth Ramach. We have already seen that the names given to king Loeguire's druids are not historical. R.IfA. PROC,? VOI*. XXXIV, SECT. C, [50]</page><page sequence="138">368 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. headway with his work of evangelization. No one else would have dared to disobey the prohibition against strange fire. Unless quenched forthwith, the light of the conquering Faith would never be extinguished. The druids of the semi- (or wholly) pagan king, Diarmait mac Cerrbeil, made a similar prophecy respecting Ciaran of Clonmacnois.1 The left-hand turn of the king before proceeding to obey the druid's behests?possibly in the stone circle called the Deisel?is extremely interesting, and is one of those vivid touches that would not have occurred to a legend-monger. Professor Bury, in his Life of St. Patrick, sees in this story a legend framed by people with " an instinct for scenic effect. The bold and brilliant idea of the first Easter fire flashing defiance across the plain of Meath to the heathen powers of Tara, and the vision of the king with his queen and sorcerers setting forth from their palace in the depth of night .... is a picture not unworthy of the best of those nameless story-makers who . . . transfigure the facts of history. The Calendar is disregarded. The idea is that Easter is to replace Beltane, the Christian to overcome the heathen fire ; and it is a matter of no import that the day of Beltane was the first day of summer which could never fall on Easter Eve."2 I cannot help thinking that in this eloquent passage Professor Bury does the hagiographers too much honour. Scenic effect was the very last thing at which those deplorably " pedestrian " writers aimed. So much is this the case, that when we come across any specially effective incident, or what seems to be a striking flight of fancy, in all the dreary waste of pointless and often immoral and un-Christian miracles?when, in short, the saint is depicted as other than an inhuman monster, doling out " shortness of life and hell" to all and singular as the penalty for the least affront?then we may fairly and without paradox affirm that the passage is too good to be false, and that here the real saint is shown to us. The delightful colloquy of St. Patrick with the simple-minded maidens of Cruachu3?the beautiful interview (infamously travestied by Moore in his Irish Melodies) between the hermit of Inis Cathaig and her who would have shared his devotion?the noble death scene of St. Ciaran, one of the most impressive passages in Christian literature ?the dignified and solemn self-revelation of the Confessio Patricii ?such treasures as these are beyond the wit of mediaeval hagiographers to invent. 1 See Silva Gadelica, i, 73 ; ii, 76. 2 Op. cit., pp. 106-7. 3 This pretty story has been spoilt by some mawkish sentimentalist, who has added a tag which made the children die after their meeting with the saint! Had the incident terminated in so gruesome a fashion, we should have heard no more of St. Patrick, for his numerous enemies would have had a very good case for arraigning him on the charge of killing the king's daughters by poison or by magic.</page><page sequence="139">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 369 They are the true Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae, and we can only regret that there are so few of them. Take, by way of contrast, a single short example of hagiographical imagination. We read in the Life of St. Ciaran of Clon macnois that when he was setting up one of the posts of his church he called out " This in the eye of Tren "?a person who had been hostile to the saint? whereupon, we are told, Tren's one eye burst in his head.1 The tale arouses a mild interest as an illustration of the belief in sympathetic magic; but the blockheads who concocted, the dullards who, unmoved with indignation, listened to, a libel so atrocious on one of the most Christ-like of Christ's followers in Ireland, would have been quite incapable of the flight of dramatic fancy with which Professor Bury's theory credits them. But apart from this argument, which is purely psychological and sub jective, there is a more serious objection to Professor Bury's criticism. The mistake of supposing that the fire lit by the king was the fire of Beltene was exposed long ago by O'Donovan.2 In fact, there is no evidence that the fire of Beltene was ever lit at Temair at all. The Lismore Life of St. Patrick asserts that the king was celebrating his own birthday,3 and the statement has been copied more than once from O'Donovan's quotation. There is little or no evidence of the celebration of birthdays as a practice in pre-Christian Ireland4; but the hagiographer spoke more truly than he knew. Easter in a.d. 433, the year of St. Patrick's coining to Temair, fell upon 26 March. As the Paschal Fire was lit on Easter Eve, the festival which the saint violated was held on 25 March. This is the very date on which, in many places, the resurrection of the deity of vegetation was celebrated. For the facts I may refer the reader to Frazer's Adonis, Attis, Osiris, i, 306. The death and resurrection of Attis were celebrated in Rome on the 25th day of March. The date corresponds to the 9th of Elaphebolion, the date of the City Dionysia of Attica.5 The happy chance of the incidence of Easter in the year after St. Patrick's landing is what apologists used to call an " undesigned coincidence," that goes far to prove {a) the recurrence of a spring festival at Temair on 25 March, and (b) the substantial historicity of the story of St. Patrick's proceedings. It further explains how the king was said to have been celebrating his "birthday." It need not have been the birthday of the man called Loeguire mac Neill; but it was the natal 1 Lismore Lives, line 4399. 2 Lebor na ccert, introduction, p. 50, 3 Ed. Stokes, line 268. 4 Though some sort of connexion seems to have been recognized between persons born on the same day of the year ; see Todd Lect,, xiv, 16. 5 Cook, Zeus, i, pp. 680 ff. pO*j</page><page sequence="140">370 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. day of the spirit of vegetation, of which Loeguire was the incarnation and representative.1 Incidentally we may notice that this presupposes the adoption in Ireland of the Julian Calendar. We need not assume that the knowledge of the Roman alphabet was the only indirect gift that the Roman Empire had made to Ireland, even though Rome never took the trouble to conquer the country. Once the principle of the Julian calendar became known, its easy applica bility to the recurrent phenomena of the solar year would commend its adop tion ; and we have here an additional piece of evidence that Ireland was by no means outside the current of general European life during the centuries preceding the introduction of Christianity. The festivals of Temair were thus coincident with the vegetation festivals of the year; the annual birth and death of the spirit of the crops. But these were not the only festivals held throughout the year. We have already seen that the annual supplies were brought for the king's use on Lugnasad. We may fairly assume that the Midsummer celebrations were also held there, as they were universally throughout the country; the fires of St. John still lighted in the West are the relics of this recurring anniversary. And it may be that the strange story of the decapitation of St. John the Baptist, the saint of Midsummer day, by Mug Uuith, may be founded in an annual celebra tion of the cutting of the last sheaf of the harvest. Frazer has collected an abundance of illustrative examples of this rite,2 which is often performed by a special person. It may be that in Ireland the duty was assigned to the functionary to whom the bull-roarer was entrusted. A passage which has been interpolated into Togdil Bruidne Da Derga gives us information, that seems to be authentic, as to how the Samain fires were lit. When St. Patrick lighted his Paschal fire he "struck it," pre sumably with a flint.3 This was necessary, as he was a newcomer. But the Bruden Da Derga passage (the original of which will be found in Revue celtique, xxii, 169) implies that a perpetual fire was kept burning from Samain to Samain, the new fire being lighted from an ember of the old. An erection called tore tened, or tore caille, meaning, apparently,4 fire-boar, or forest (= timber)-boar, was made. This seems to rurve been a structure of logs, fitted closely together, in the heart of which the fire was lighted, so that if a log were removed the fire would blaze out of the opening.5 11 owe this ingenious observation to Mr. Cook. 2 See especially chap, v of Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild. 3 Robeanad in tene, Lismore Life, line 326. See Stokes's note, ad loc. 4 Why should the erection have been called a boar ? Was it supposed to be the image of a boar-divinity 1 6 See loc. cit., p. 165.</page><page sequence="141">Macauster?Temair Breg; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 371 Something like the pyramidal structure in the " clavie" burnt annually at Burghead1 seems to be indicated. When the erection had burnt down, the embers were taken, and "stones placed in the Samain-fire"?that is to say, the fire was slowed down so as to be kept alive through the year; and the fire of the following Samain was re-lit from the embers. The writer of this gloss supposed that the succession of Samain fires had begun in the beacon lit at Da Derga's Hostel on the occasion which is described in the romance. In this we need not follow him; but, as is always the case, the fact that such an explanation is given is evidence of the real existence of the thing to be explained?in this case the unbroken succession of the Samain fire. The king, as representative of the divinity that kept the sun alight, was bound to keep alight a perpetual fire at Temair; and to cause it to blaze up at Samain, when the sun was dying, and at the vernal equinox, in order to quicken the sun's reviving flame. In the same way, the Paschal fire burnt continuously, and was the source from which the other fires of a monastery were lighted. When the Paschal fire of St. Ciaran's monastery at Saigir was maliciously extinguished, the brethren had to make shift with out a fire at all until it was miraculously re-kindled.2 The passage above quoted from 1'ogdil Bruidne Da Derga implies that the Samain festival was held annually at Temair. The constant tradition that appears throughout Irish literature is, however, that it was a triennial celebration. The two statements are not necessarily inconsistent. The celebration may have been held annually, but only publicly every three years. Certainly the festival which St. Patrick interrupted seems to have been confined to the household of Temair. We may, perhaps, venture to compare the Eleusinia, which took place annually, but "seem to have been conducted every four years with especial splendour."3 Every year there was a festival at Temair, but only every three years was there a congress.4 As Temair declined in religious interest, owing to the advance of Christianity, the celebration of the feis became irregular. The last celebration recorded was in 559 or 560 a.d. Four years later the king Diarmait mac Cerrbeil was murdered. He appears to have been the last king with pagan sympathies, and the feis thus came automatically to an end. It was natural for the later hagiographers to connect this cessation of the/eis with the curse of Euadan, 1 See Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist, i (1895), 22. 2 Betha Chiardin, in Silva Gadelica, i, 14; ii, 15. 3 Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, iii, 165. 4 For the meaning of such periodical festivals at intervals of more than one year, see the very ingenious explanation in Frazer's Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild, i, 77 sqq.</page><page sequence="142">372 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. and to infer that not only was the triennial festival abandoned, but that the ridge itself had been deserted. It is needless to enter here into the general question of the nature and purpose of fire-festivals such as these. Much has been written on this subject in recent years; and wTe must confine ourselves in the present study to Temair.. Besides his function as a surety for the goodness of crops, the king was also responsible for the fruitfulness of the cattle. A bad king is marked by failure in the cattle, as well as in the harvest. He is likewise responsible for failure in the fishing. Returning to the question, which god was incarnate in the king, reference should be made to Mr. Cook's articles on the European Sky-god, already alluded to.1 Much evidence will there be found pointing to Nuadu as the favoured deity. The most noteworthy of these is the passage in Coir Anmann2 to the effect that Irel Faith, the king who followed Eremon in the kingdom ' ' was the Nuadu Airgetlam of the sons of Mil, but we knmv not how that comes about (ni fdtamair cidh dia to). I refer to this, as it is a most valuable testimony to the care with which the writers of this and similar compilations recorded what they found in the documents before them, even when they confessedly were unable to comprehend them. Mr. Cook shows also3 that Lug was supposed to be immanent in the king: and it may be further suggested that the divine woodsman Esus (by whatever name he was called in Ireland) was also resident within him. Esus is represented felling a tree, under which stands the sun-bull, Tarvos Trigaranos, on the famous altars of Paris and Treves. Now in the monotonous list of kings contained in the " official histories," one of the details told about all the important kings is that they cleared so many plains of timber. This was a work of practical utility, and the annalists doubtless regard it as such and nothing more. But it is possible, without undue straining of probability, to read something deeper into a statement which is repeated with such frequency. The divine woodman alone was privileged to cut divine trees. It was the king's prerogative as the incarnation of Esus.4 This multiplicity of incarnations can best be explained by supposing that these important Celtic gods have entered into the inheritance of some older divinity. Such a divinity is Fal, who has no place in the "official" genealogies 1 See especially the part contained in Folk-lore, xvii, 26-71. 2 Irische Texte, iii, p. 326. 3 Folk-lore, xvii, 157, 343. 4 For classical parallels see Mr. Cook's article Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak, in the Classical Review, xvii, especially at pp. 180, 181.</page><page sequence="143">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 373 of the Tuatha De Danann. Now a curious passage in Coir Anmann hints at a tale of a marriage between Fal and Nuadu, which would imply that Fal, in spite of the masculine form of his name, was a goddess. We are told that king Nuadu Finn-Fail, who is of course only an " avatar" of the deity, derived his name from his being " a fair man," and because he was in the habit of " sporting with and making love to " the Stone of Fal.1 This seems to indicate a deep-rooted doubt as to the sex to which Fal belonged. Such an uncertainty is not quite the same as a change of sex which has befallen a deity in the course of his history.2 Venus is a well-knowTn example of the latter phenomenon. It is rather an indication that the god was borrowed at the first from some external source, without complete knowledge of his special characters. Now, it is worthy of notice that there is a very ancient Italian god who also shows an uncertainty as to his sex. This is the deity of shepherds, Pales by name, honoured on his solemn feast, the Parilia, held on 21 April, but other wise, apparently, forgotten.3 The Parilia was a festival designed to secure the fertility of cattle. Among the rites of the festival was the driving of sheep through or between fires; for the survival in these countries of similar rites down to our time, on Mayday, see Ehys, Celtic Folklore, i, 309.4 When we recollect that the feast of St. " Ibar" of Beg-Eire, alias Inis Fail, is 23 April, only two days after the Parilia, we are tempted to wonder whether there is not here something more than accident. The philologists will no doubt remind me, firmly but [more suo) not very gently, that the names Fal and Pales cannot be regarded as possessing more than a superficial resemblance. This we may grant freely?if they are to be regarded as a genuine Indo European inheritance. But what if the name, like the deity, is a loan from without ? Is it impossible that in this seemingly bisexual5 deity, buried deep in the traditions of Celtic and Italian tribes alike, connected with agricultural or pastoral rites in both communities, celebrated on almost the same day in 1 Irische Texte, iii, 326. - We use masculine terms and pronouns throughout this and the following paragraphs to avoid cumbersome expressions such as " his or her" which the limitations of the English language would otherwise impose upon us. 3 See Frazer, The Magic Art, ii, chap, xix ; also the article Pales in Roscher's Lexikon. 4 See also Keating, Forus Feasa (I.T.S.), ii, 246. 6 I use the word "bisexual" advisedly, for the very remarkable figure from Quilly (Loire-Inferieure), illustrated in Bulletin de la Societe d1 Anthropologic de Paris, ser. iv, vol. x, p. 144, is evidence for the existence of a hermaphrodite deity among the Conti nental Celts. The figure is in the squatting attitude of Cernunnos, and may well be the representative of a type that became a connecting-link between the male Cernunnos figures and the female "Sheelah-na-gigs,"</page><page sequence="144">374 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. both communities, we are to see some god of, let us say, an ancient Neolithic non-Aryan tribe in Central Europe ? And here, perhaps, is the direction in which we are to look for the solution of an old puzzle. In a tenth-century MS. preserved in Merseburg Cathedral, there is written a charm for the cure of a lame horse. The charm is one of a well-known type, which relates in the fewest possible words (sometimes in prose, sometimes in rude verse), the story of a cure performed by some sacred personage. Take the following as an example of the commonest form :? Saint Pierre sur le pont de Dieu s'assit, Notre-Dame de Caly vint et lui dit? 'i Pierre, que fais-tu laV " Dame, c'est pour le mal De mon chef, que je me suis mis Id.1' " Saint Pierre, tu te lever as, A Saint-Agie tu t'en iras, Tu prendras le saint onguent Des plaies mortelles de Notre-Seigneur : Tu Ven graisseras, Et troisfois tu dims, &lt; Jtsus, Maria.1 m It needs no argument to prove that such a charm is of pagan origin, and that names and formulae sacred in the Christian Faith have been substituted for names and formulae of an elder faith ; further, that the charm is a worn down folk-story. The personage invoked (in the above example Notre-Dame de Caly) is reminded of a marvellous cure with which he or she is credited in some current popular tale, and is besought to repeat the act of power for the benefit of the sufferer using the charm. The Merseburg charm differs from the majority of its kind in preserving the pagan names. It runs as follows:? Phol ende Wodan vuorun zi holza, Do wart demo Balderes volon sin vuoz birenkit. Thu biguolen Sinhtgunt (sic) Sunnd era suister, Thu biguolen Frua, Volla era suister, Thu biguolen Wddan so he wola conda. Sose benrenki, sose bluotrenki, sose lidirenki, Ben zi bena, bluot zi bluoda, Lid zi geliden, sose gelimida sin.2 1 From L. F. Sauve^ Le Folk-lore des Hautes-Vosges (Paris, Maisonneuve et Leclerc), p. 350. 2 Jacob Grimm, Kleinere Schriften, voL ii, p. 11 et seqq. I have to thank Mr. A. B. Cook for calling my attention to some of the literature on this charm.</page><page sequence="145">Macalistek?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 376 " Phol and Wodan fared to a wood, There was Balder's foal's foot wrenched. Then charmed Sinthgund, Sunna her sister, Then charmed Frua, Volla her sister, Then charmed Wodan, as he well knew [how]. As bone wrenching, so blood-wrenching, so limb-wrenching, Bone to bone, blood to blood, Limb to limbs, as though they were glued." The story alluded to is not elsewhere recorded; but its outline is quite clear. Wodan and his companion find Balder in difficulties, owing to his horse's lameness. The obscure goddesses named have vainly tried to charm the injured limb?the tale, like the common motive of the three brothers, narrated two failures to accomplish the task, and the success of the third attempt, made in this case by Wodan. How far the original story entered into the details of the operation, and the reason for the failures, we have no means of knowing. Our present interest is not with these unanswerable questions, but with Wodan's companion. His name is unknown elsewhere in the vast range of Teutonic literature. The context shows clearly that he is a god ; but what god ? Grimm would equate him to Balder ;x but as Chantepie de la Saussaye, in his Religion of the Teutons, points out, he does not explain why Balder appears under his own more usual name in the following line. To this we may add, that surely the sense of the passage is that Wodan and his companion came to the assistance of Balder, as in the charm previously quoted Notre-Dame came to help St. Peter, and as those who used the charm prayed these supernatural beings to come to their aid. Though the god's name is unknown elsewhere, Grimm, with the clue afforded by the charm, has discovered reminiscences of him in certain place names. Such are Pfalsau in Bavaria, formerly Pholesauwa, " Phot's island " ; Pfalzpoint, formerly Pholespiunt, " PhoFs enclosed field "; Phulsborn, formerly Pholesbrunnen, " Phol's spring." He has further discovered from certain legal records of the Palatinate of Upper Rhineland that the second day of May was in that region called Pfuhltag or Pulletag, meaning apparently " Phol's day." It is noteworthy that the region where these names occur is the country intercepted between the upper waters of the Rhine and those of the Danube, the country where for other reasons D'Arbois de Jubainville fixed the cradle of the Celts. In some other comparisons Grimm hardly appears so happy. The earth works and other structures, called in modern speech Teufelsgraben, Pfalgrdben, 1 Teutonic Mythology, tr. Stallybrass, vol iii, p. xix. R.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C. [51]</page><page sequence="146">376 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Pfahltobel, Schweingrciben, he would associate with the name thus recovered? the last on account of a supposed M.H.G. word foi, meaning "boar." But we have here in Ireland a " Black Pig's Dyke " independently of the essential link of Middle High German. As for the words compounded with pfal,pfahl9 he tells us that the commonly received etymology from Pfahl, " stake," cannot be right, as there are no stakes in the structures. This observation we now know to be erroneous. Further, notwithstanding the coincidence of Phol's day with the beginning of May, I hardly see my way to follow him in equating the name Phol with the Bel of Beltene. It is surely significant that although Phol takes no part in the proceedings, yet his name is mentioned before that of the great Wodan. This suggests a superiority that can be accounted for, with the facts before us, only on the hypothesis of a superior antiquity. We have, in short, in the charm an interesting case of the stratification of two pre-Christian faiths, just as in the French illustration we have the Christian and a pre-Christian faith superposed. Wodan and Frua, who with Balder are the only characters in the scene whose names are familiar to us, take the place of some pre-Germanic gods, as Our Lady of Caly and St. Peter take the place of pre-Christian beings in the charm from Hautes-Vosges. In this connexion it may not be without meaning that the scribe of the MS. writes the name in a peculiar way?Plol, with the h above the P. Is this possibly an attempt at representing the to him unwonted and foreign sound of &lt;p, a p followed by an aspirate ? In CarmichaeTs Carmina Gadelica, vol. ii, pp. 14-21, are given a number of Gaelic charms from the Scottish Highlands, so closely resembling that of Merseburg that they can hardly.be unrelated to it. Most probably they and the Merseburg charm are derived from a common source. The Gaelic charms have been christianised ; in most of them Christ takes the place of Wodan and of Balder, though in two of them St. Brigid is introduced, not unsug gestively. Eemembering what Coir Anmann hints at, as to a connexion of some kind between Fal and Nuadu, may we permit ourselves to guess that in an older version of the incantation Nodons occupied the place held in the Merseburg version by Wodan ? The corruption involved would be easy and natural in a Teutonic branch of the tradition. However that may be, it is to say the least noteworthy that when we fish in the deeper waters of Italian theology, we hook Pales; when we plumb the depths of Teutonic religion, we find Phol; and far down below the surface of the troubled sea of Celtic divinities we discover Fal. It may be added that in Arcadia we find an extraordinary being, by name Pholos. He looks like a Centaur, but is in parentage and disposition totally different from the</page><page sequence="147">MaCalLstkr?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 377 orthodox Centaurs.1 He is, in fact, just the sort of being that would develop out of an ancient hippanthropic deity who had originally no connexion with Centaurs, but who found himself among a people that had evolved the concep tion of the normal type of those disagreeable creatures.2 We may suppose that Phoi was likewise a deity who had something to do with horses, otherwise his appearance in the Merseburg charm would be inexplicable. Fal had certainly a great deal to do with the inauguration of the divine horse-king at Temair. There is no such traceable connexion of Pales with horses. But perhaps all these scattered beings, taken together, enable us to get a little nearer to the " Divine Horse-man," with whom we began our study in these devious paths. At any rate, Fal belongs certainly to an older stratum of belief than the divine beings among the Tuatha De Dauann, who are, so to speak, the dii consentes of Irish Celtic tradition. Except the one passage quoted from Coir Anmann, hinting at some sort of connexion between Nuadu and Fal, there is no trace of any relation between Fal and the Tribe of Danu. But if Fal be borrowed from some non-Aryan, neolithic (?) pastoral horse-divinity, the ceremonies at the stone of F&amp;l which completed the induc tion of the king would become the more intelligible. Fal, the horse divinity, standing somewhere near Duma na Bo, the mound of the sacred cow, accepted the new king, if indeed he did not infuse his personality into him by his mysterious scream. The bull-roarer does not appear to have been used in the Parilia rites; but this might have been a local legacy from pre-Celtic rites at Temair, and peculiar to that site. To some similar local contamina tion we may, perhaps, trace the different calendar days sacred to the god in Italian, Celtic, and Teutonic centres. It is a difficulty in the way of the complete identification of Pales, Phol, and Fal, that the first is celebrated on 21 April, the second on 2 May, while the chief festival of Temair seems to have fallen in Samain, at a different time of the year altogether. The transference of the festival to near May-day (as in the Rhineland) is perhaps not difficult to understand ; and if there were any evidence (which there is not) that May-day was specially celebrated at Temair, our troubles would be greatly diminished. For the Samain feast began a fortnight before 1 November;3 and if the Beltene feast began equally early, it would 1 See Roscher's articles Kentauren and Pholos. 2 The Master of Emmanuel writes to me: u^6\os has no early authority in Greek, Theo critus being apparently the first to mention him ; though of course he may be very much earlier. There is no obvious etymology for the name in Greek : it therefore might quite well be non-Greek or prae-Greek. Rut when it comes to borrowing from an unknown language there are no rules one can go by." 3 Silva Gadelica, vol. i, 319 ; vol. ii, 360. [61']</page><page sequence="148">378 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. include the date of the Parilia. The evidence at our disposal would indicate that the Parilia was maintained at or near the proper date when the worship of Fal was established at Beg Eire (as witness the incidence of St. Ibar's day); but that when it was centralized at Temair, the paramount importance of a previously existing Samain feast eclipsed the true festival of Fal, and it fell into disuse. It is possible also that it was absorbed by the mid-March festival of Temair, to which we have already made allusion. The varied activities of the periodical assemblies are described for us in many places, especially the Dindshenchas of Carman,1 which has long been recognized as our chief source of information on the subject. It is needless to analyze this poem here. But a very interesting passage in the poem on N&amp;s2 must not be overlooked, as linking the assemblies with the periodical lamentations that took place annually in many centres of cultus. The lamentations for the wives of Lug, the sun-god, are analogous to the Adonis, Attis, Tammuz, and similar commemorations of which Frazer and other students of early ceremonial have collected a large number from all over the world. Besides the games, hucksterings, legal proceedings, and the like, which were carried on on these occasions, there seem also to have been acts of divination and oracle-giving. Queen Medb had the events of the year foretold to her at Samain.3 These oracles were sometimes distinguished by an ingenious ambiguity worthy of the Delphic Pythia; witness the prophecy that King Loeguire should meet his death " between Eire and Alba '9 (two hills of the names), or that Find mac Umaill would perish after drinking from a horn?a prophecy fulfilled by the name of the place where he drank from a well.4 The manifestations of religion with which we have been concerned, with the exception of the use of the bull-roarer, are to be associated with the Celtic invaders of the country. But Temair was a religious centre before the coming of the Celtic-speaking peoples. The cults which these intro duced were grafted on to the religious rites of their predecessors. We must therefore now enquire what the latter may have been. We find at Temair traces of the cult of sacred animals, sacred trees, sacred waters, and of the dead. Most or all of these are to be assigned to the aborigines. (1) Sacred animals.?These may be either real or imaginary. Of the cult of the latter, which take the form of monsters, we may perhaps see a trace in 1 See Todd Lectures, x, 2. - Op. cit., p. 48 ; see p. 50, line 29 et seqq. 3 SUva Gadelica, i, 179; ii, 202. 4 Aided Finn in Meyer's Cath Finntrdga, p. 74.</page><page sequence="149">Macalistkk?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 379 the stone of the Mata at the south end of the ridge, and the mound of the Luch-donn, the Brown Mouse?really a terrible monster, in spite of his insignificant name?at the northern end. But it is the cult of real animals which was by far the most important. The only name common to the three versions of the "epic" dynasty, which we have set forth in a previous section, is Fiachu. We infer from this that Fiachu is a name from the original epic; indeed this one word is the only fragment of the epic which has survived. In two of the versions of the dynasty, this Fiachu is associated in a curious way with cattle; and we have already inferred that in the Celtic epic Fiachu was a culture-hero, who taught the arts of the pastoral life to his people. The invaders found their predecessors worshipping a cattle-divinity on the ridge. The cult of this deity took the form of the maintenance of a sacred cow, or of sacred cattle, in which the god was doubtless supposed to be immanent. The existence of sacred cattle on the ridge is testified to by the name Duma na Bo, the " mound of the cow," so called from Glas Temrach, the grey cow of Temair, and by the name of the two wells, that of the White Cow and that of the Calf. With this aboriginal cow-divinity the invaders probably identified the Fiachu of their own traditions. At this stage a question naturally arises. Was the " Grey Cow " or the " White Cow " one animal, which lived and died once for all and was buried within the mound called Duma na Bo; or was there a succession of sacred animals, each taking the place of its predecessor when the latter went the way from which even divine cows are not exempt ? The latter alternative is by far the more probable. All analogy is against the maintenance of one sacred animal, without provision for a successor. There would be no reason in so doing; for the purpose of the sacred cow was doubtless to insure the presence of the cattle-god in the midst of his people, and so to secure fruitfulness in the herds. But in that case, it will be objected, wTe ought to have not one '* Mound of the Cow," but a whole cemetery of sacred cattle. The objection is not, however, valid, and may be met in one of two ways. In the first place, it remains to be determined whether Duma na Bo was a burial-mound or not; and the most unfortunate doubt which exists as to the identification of this mound makes it improbable that this vital point will ever be satisfactorily settled. If it was a mound in which the remains of a sacred cow had been buried, we may at least remember that the burial of a single individual sacred animal is not unprecedented. Thus, we may recall the grave-monument of the</page><page sequence="150">380 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. horse at Sparta, whose tradition is recorded for us by Pausanias.1 This seems to have been a single burial of a single sacred animal. But, on the other hand, Duma na Bom&amp;y not have been a burial mound at all. It may well have been the site of the sacred dairy, in which the succession of kine was kept or milked. We seem to see an indication of a religious institution analogous in no small degree to the sacred dairies which are the sole temples of the Todas of the Nilgiri Hills.2 At this point we may call to mind the tradition that makes one of the founders of Temair a lady called Cro-find. This foundress has, I suggest, been evolved from a by-name of Temair, Cathair Croi-Iind, which would mean the "fortress of the white cattle-stall." The sacred cow was indicated by certain marks, chief of which appear to have been red ears on a white body. The milk of such cattle was an antidote to the poison of weapons ; Lebor Gabdla says that the Milesians, i.e. the Celtic peoples, learnt this useful fact from Drosten (note the name and cf. p. 296) a "druid" of the Cruithne or aborigines. That the sanctity of such animals continued into Celtic times?that, in fact, the incoming Celts took over many of the beliefs and the rites of their predecessors?is shown inter alia by the fact that the milk of such cattle was the only food that St. Brigid, as a child, could assimilate.3 This probably means that the head of the college of the goddess at Kildare was under some geis that affected and restricted her food ; we may fairly compare some of the food-geasa collected by Frazer,4 such as these?" the heir to the throne of Loango is forbidden from infancy to eat pork .... The head chief of the Masai may eat nothing but milk, honey, and the roasted livers of goats," and more especially " the diet of the king of Unyoro in Central Africa was strictly regulated .... He must live on milk and beef .... The milk vms always drawn from a sacred herd which uas kept for his exclusive use." Sacred trees. Though the syncretism of pre-Celtic and of Celtic religions was carried out to a considerable length, it was not complete. The king of the Ulaid, for instance, might not attend the feast of the Bull of Daire son of Daire?that is, of Oak son of Oak. The connexion of sacred cattle and sacred trees is now a commonplace of comparative religion, and need not here be enlarged upon. We see it in the Tarvos Trigaranos standing under the sacred tree, on the altars of Paris and of Treves. It must be admitted that there is no record, so far as I have been able to find, of any conspicuous single 1 III, xx, 9. * See W. H. K. Rivers' monograph on this primitive tribe (London, 1906), 3 Lismore Lives, line 1225. 4 Taboo and the Perils of the Soul, p. 291 ff.</page><page sequence="151">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 381 sacred tree at Temair; but the statements that it was once a " delightful hazel-grove " (VD i) and that an old name for it was Ros (" wood ") must not be forgotten. A grove growing on a ridge so sacred must almost of necessity have been itself sacred ; as there was a sacred grove at Aricia, so there was a sacred grove at Temair, which presents so many remarkable points of analogy with the Italian sanctuary. With sacred trees are also associated sacred stones, and we have already been able to draw up a goodly list of these. Some of them were no doubt Celtic in origin, but others may have been pre-Celtic. Sacred waters. The Ridge of Temair is well supplied with springs; indeed it may have been this fact that first invested it with sanctity in the eyes of the ancient inhabitants. The names these bore, and the qualities ascribed to some of them, are sufficient to show their sacred character. The Dead. Temair early became tlie centre of an important cemetery. As has already been said, it is most likely that this was a secondary circumstance, the sanctity of the ridge having attracted the cemetery, and not the cemetery having invested the site with sanctity. The site would, however, derive increased sacredness from the burial mounds, and a cult of the dead would inevitably be added to the other cults which centred in the ridge. This probably lasted into Christianity ; the contrast between the total disappear ance of some of the grave-mounds, and the fair preservation of the residential earthworks, is very noticeable, and can partly be explained as due to the intentional destruction of the former in order to put a stop to objectionable rites.1 We may now gather together all the details, and give a connected summary of what we may suppose to have been the religious rites of the sanctuary, in continuation of the historical summary at the end of Section 3. (1) The pre-Celtic organization being based on mother right, Ungust ruled over his people by virtue of his connexion with his wife or his mother. Jn view of this fact it was possible for the early traditions to ascribe the foundation of Temair to a woman. With this woman the Celts identified their Tea, daughter of Lugaid (= the sun-god Lug) son of Ith (= corn); this identification indicates the original nature of the settlement on the ridge, as a centre of rites associated with the deities of vegetation. The purely political or secular side of the life of Temair was at first far in the background, if indeed it had any existence at all. 1 Treasure-hunting may also be partly responsible. The rifling of the graves of the dead is an ancient industry. The first practitioner in Ireland was no less a personage than St. Patrick ; see Acallam na Sendrach^ ed. Stokes, p. 31,</page><page sequence="152">382 Proceedings of the Rogal Irish Academy. (2) The site contained, in pre-Celtic times? - Sacred wells; A sacred dairy; A sacred grove; ? and it became the site of an important cemetery. Ungust and his successors were, however, not buried there, but at Brug. It maj^ be that their wives were buried at Tailltiu.1 (3) The worship-rites here observed in the pre-Celtic period took the form of what we may fairly call corroborees, at which the bull-roarer was used. (4) There was a stone circle at the north end of the ridge, which was very likely the central sanctuary in which these rites were performed. But doubtless the whole ridge was sacred, and there were special rites peculiar to the different holy places upon it. (5) The Celtic invaders entered at the south-east corner of the country, and there first established their special religious observances. In time they spread over the whole country, and when they reached the sanctuary of Temair they took it over with its religions, and added their own rites to the ancient ceremonies. (6) The newcomers imported the following deities :?Pal, and perhaps M&amp;irisiu, representing an earlier stratum ;2 and Geide, the storm-god, euphe mistically called In Dagdae, with Bros, Nuadu, Lug, and the other deities grouped together as the Tuatha De Danann. Their union with the gods of the aborigines produced an elaborate syncretism, expressed by genealogical or marital relations between different deities, or by the fusing of two or more gods into one god with two or more names.3 (7) The totem-animal of the incomers was the horse, as that of the aborigines had been the cow. (8) The ridge now became the centre of a divine kingship in which the king, totemistically connected with the horse, was also an incarnation of the god of vegetation and of richness of cattle. 1 The separation of males and females in burial even yet persists at Inismurray and elsewhere. - If Fal should represent the deity called Pales in Italy, it is conceivable that Mairisiu may be comparable with Mater Matuta, who in Italy is associated with Pales, and even sometimes, apparently, fused with him. 3 The syncretism of an incoming god (like G&amp;de) with an aboriginal hero such as Ungust has its parallels in Greek religion, where we find correspondences established between Poseidon and Erechtheus, or between Dionysus and Cadmus,</page><page sequence="153">Macalistkk?-Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 383 (9) The purpose of this king being to secure fertility in its various mani festations, it was essential that he should be married, so as to produce the result aimed at by sympathetic magic. (10) As it was important that the king should be the strongest man available in the community, anyone who could slay the holder of the office was entitled to succeed. (11) If the king died in office of an apparently natural death, it was regarded as an interposition of the gods, and the succession had to be repaired by an elaborate ritual, in which the sacred animals (both bull and horse), F&amp;l, and other deities or deified men took part. (12). The annual celebrations took the form of assemblies connected with the crises of the solar year. (13) A perpetual fire was kept burning, made to blaze into full life on the occasions when the sun seemed to need quickening. (14) Cormac mac Airt, a man of enlightenment and alert mind, influenced by what he had learned of the Roman organization of Britain, set himself to develop the political rather than the religious side of the life of Temair; for which he seems to have incurred Druidic maledictions. He was partly, but not wholly, successful. If it fell within our present scope to follow out the later history of the ridge, it would appear that the religious interest was dominant throughout, and that when Christianity conquered the earlier faiths the importance of the site dwindled almost to vanishing point; .although it is not correct to say that it ever was wholly abandoned down to the end of the independence of Ireland. 7. The Place of Temair in European Culture. Till now we have been considering Temair as the scene of the local corroborees of the pre-Celtic and the Celtic tribes which successively occupied the region in wdiich it stands. We have now to see that it is the centre of a much wider interest. Our researches have led us to the conclusion that there is an intimate connexion between Temair and the tumulus now called New Grange, which is the chief monument of the ancient cemetery called Brug na Boinne. When we turn our attention to this structure, we find there a great earthen mound, containing a stone-built passage leading to a central tomb-chamber. The plan is extraordinarily like, that of the dromos-tholos tombs of the Late Minoan cultures, of which the so-called Treasury of Atreus is the best-known example. Three burial-chambers radiate from the tholos 'at New Grange, R.I.A. PKOC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. Q. [52]</page><page sequence="154">384 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. corresponding to the one chamber in the Atreus tomb. Though the con struction of the New Grange dromos is megalithic, that of the tholos is microlithic, in spite of the facts that the walls are masked all round with colossal blocks of stone, and that the side tomb-chambers are roofed with large slabs. New Grange is thus transitional in style between a megalithic and a microlithic construction. The large stones are elaborately decorated with spirals, lozenges, zigzags, and other geometrical devices. When the wonderful discoveries that our generation has seen in the island of Crete began to be made, in the closing years of the last century, they were hailed in the first rush of enthusiasm as the source and explanation of all the developments of Bronze-age culture in Central and Northern Europe. It was naturally supposed that the spiral pattern originated in Crete, and passed into the hands of the late Minoans of the mainland?the people that had till then been called Mycenaeans?and that from them it travelled along definite trade-routes to the barbarians of the North. The merchant caravans of the cultured Aegean peoples journeyed to the far north lands of Scandinavia and Britain, and to the far west land of Spain, in search of amber, tin, and other valuable commodities; and in return they taught some of the arts of the Aegean to the rude tribes with which they came in contact. The dromos tombs of Mycenae aud Orchomenos, with their rich spiral decorations, were the prototypes; the dromos tomb of New Grange, with its barbaric spirals, was the copy. The date of New Grange was confidently fixed at about 1200 1000 B.C., on the basis of this supposed connexion between it and the tombs of Mycenae, the dates of which can be approximately determined. In short, the Cretan and Mycenaean traders took the place that an earlier generation of antiquaries had accorded to the Phoenicians. Cretan cults and culture were traced where the contemporaries of Stukeley and of Vallancey had seen " the god Baal." Now the god Baal, as understood by Stukeley and his friends, had no existence, even in Phoenicia; and I have for some time felt an increasing suspicion that the far-travelled Cretan merchants are destined to follow him to dreamland. There can be no denial of the remarkable resemblance between the Mycenaean dromos tomb and tfhe New Grange type of sepulchre. The same plan is followed in both. The same motives of ornament appear* in both. But let us for a moment consider what is of necessity implied in the accept ance of these resemblances as a proof of the radiation of art-influences outward from the Aegean basin, along the trade-routes. It means that the traders were not only merchants, but were also enthusiastic missionaries. It means that they took the trouble to teach the barbarians with whom they came in contact how to reverence the dead aright, and how to build and to decorate</page><page sequence="155">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 385 their tombs. It also means that the barbarians had not the usual conser vatism of the savage, but that they were sufficiently interested in the message of the strangers to give up their own ways in favour of the ways of unknown people two thousand miles away. All this is possible; but it is in the last degree unlikely. It may be taken for granted that if an amber or tin merchant goes among a barbarous people, he goes to buy amber or tin, and not to teach ' new ideas in religion or in art to the natives with whom he has to deal. He carries with him the commodities which he knowrs by experience they will accept in barter, not plans of cumbersome tombs or designs for their artistic enrichment. It is, indeed, a fair criticism of the theory that would derive New Grange and allied monnments from the Mycenaean tombs, that the resemblance between them is too great. There was certainly a trade in tin and amber between the Aegean culture-centres and the northern tribes. But how would this trade be carried on ? Not, surely, by single caravans, travelling the whole distance; but by a number of independent caravans, each oscillating back and forth along one stage of the journey. At the meeting-points, each of them would exchange its goods with the caravan of the next stage. Such traders would no doubt exchange stories and news as well as merchandise, and in this way rumours of the great tombs of Mycenae could conceivably be carried to the north of Europe. But it may be questioned whether these rumours, vague as they would necessarily be, could inspire the northerners to try to build tombs to the Mycenaean model. An imitation with no better guidance than a description carried across Europe by word of mouth could hardly be so successful as it actually is. So far as the plan of New Grange and its construction are concerned, the building can be completely explained as the evolution, and (so to speak) the glorification of a dolmen of the allee couverte type; and we need not go so far afield as Mycenae to look for satisfactory prototypes. I may say at once that I am utterly unable to accept theories of culture-development that do not' recognize the possibility of the co-existence of more than one independent culture-centre. I cannot side with those who seek to derive all the world's civilization from one region, whether it be Egypt, Crete, India, Mesopotamia? or even Atlantis! Given anywhere a religion that requires a periodical visit to the tombs, then a dromos-tholos structure of some kind will evolve naturally, without necessary relations with any other centre. That the religion which centred in the Mycenaean tombs was such, may be inferred from the elaborate tholos, which was not in itself a burial-place, but a kind of chapel, an ante-room to the tomb-chamber proper. That the religion which centred in New Grange was likewise such, is indicated by a very interesting [52*J</page><page sequence="156">386 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. feature of that monument, which has not received the attention which it deserves. This is a standing stone, which, when the chamber was first opened in 1699, was in the centre of the tholos. It is shown in the oldest plan of the chamber, that of Molyneux. It must have shortly afterwards disappeared, for later writers never mention it?doubtless it was appropriated for a gate post or for some such purpose. Its existence has in recent times been called into question; but, as I think, unjustifiably. It is difficult to see how Molyneux could have been so positive if he had really seen no such stone; and in our own time at least two analogous monuments, of which Molyneux could have had no cognizance, have come to light. One of these is a similar standing stone in the underground bronze-age burial-place at Ballynehatty, near the Giants' Eing.1 The other is in one of the burial-earns at Carrowkeel, Co. Sligo, the excavation of which was not long ago reported to the Eoyal Irish Academy.2 This last example is especially interesting, for near it were lying a number of small rounded stones. Precisely similar stones were lying in the right-hand grave-chamber of New Grange when it was first opened. They are represented in Molyneux s cut. The drawing is rude, but the resemblance is unmistakable to one who, like myself, saw the Carrowkeel stones in position. They are certainly baetylic hand-stones of some sort; and their resemblance to the Australian churinga is too striking to escape notice. These stones, at both Carrowkeel and at New Grange, testify to a cult in which the grave-chamber was periodically visited for some purpose or another. But someone will at this stage object that I am ignoring the evidence of the spirals. It has become a sort of canon of European archaeology that the spiral motive in decoration travelled through Europe from the Aegean along certain trade-routes: and though the constructional resemblance between the Mycenaean tombs and New Grange can thus be explained away, yet it will be urged that the spirals are still strong enough to -bind the two together. Now, it is true that at Orchomenos in Boeotia there is a dromos-tholos tomb having its ceiling decorated with a beautiful diaper of spirals: and that at New Grange there is a dromos-tholos tomb with what might be called a childish copy of that diaper ornamenting its interior. But spirals cannot travel through the air; they must be depicted on some portable object in order to find their way from Orchomenos to the neighbourhood of Drogheda. The lines of the trade-routes connecting these distant places ought to 1 See Ulster Journal of Archaeology, old series, iii, 358. 2 Proceedings R.I. A., xxix C, pp. 326, 334.</page><page sequence="157">Macalister? Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 387 be peppered with objects of Late Minoan art bearing spirals. Even a few painted potsherds would be sufficient. But there is no such thing. The media through which the spiral patterns were ex hypothesi carried to the North have totally disappeared. When this difficulty first occurred to me, I found refuge in the idea that they might have been woven on textiles, which had been bartered to the native tribes in exchange for their tin or their amber. But to this too easy way out of the difficulty I soon saw a fatal objection. The curves of the spirals are not suitable for the ornamentation of textiles. When they were applied thereto, they became rectilinear, and the " Greek fret" pattern survives to show us what the influence of textile work on the spiral pattern has been. Had woven garments carried the spiral patterns to the north, we ought to have found the Greek fret at New Grange; but that motive of decoration nowhere appears in Northern Europe before the La Tene period. In short, the goods bartered with the northern barbarians in exchange for their tin and their amber were not treasures of Aegean art, but cattle, the one thing which the rude barbarians could appreciate, and the usual medium of exchange before the invention of coinage. Therefore, if we are to suppose that the barbarians acquired the spiral patterns from the Aegean merchants, we must once more postulate the enthusiastic trading missionary, who taught them how to draw spirals in the intervals of business. I for one cannot believe in that engaging altruist. I prefer to believe that the spirals at New Grange are not derived from the Aegean at all, but that they are an independent growth. If so, they must have had a meaning. People in the cultural stage of the builders of New Grange do not cultivate " art for art's sake." Some simple religious or magical significance must lie hidden in these patterns. And after what has been said in the preceding pages it is not difficult to see generally what that meaning is likely to be. The admirable photographs in Mr. Coffey's book on New Grange shew us that the chief motives are lozenges, spirals, zigzags, triangleSj and an oval with two or three holes in a line along its major axis (fig. 4&amp;). There are one or two other figures, such as the well-known " palm-leaf," which occur once or twice only ; but those enume rated are the materials of which the great majority of the patterns are composed. We may see in the lozenges, the head of the bull-roarer; in the spirals, an attempt to express the motion of the hand in keeping the bull roarer in motion, and thus a symbol of the rotating bull-roarer; in the zigzags, the lightnings of the thunder-god; in the triangles, the axe or the hammer of the thunder-god. The oval with dots I explain as a variety of the bull-roarer known as a "buzz" in America, where it is used by several</page><page sequence="158">388 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. of the native tribes. It consists of a disc of wood with two holes through which an endless loop of cord is passed. This being twisted and passed over the hands, the disc is made to revolve rapidly alternately twisting and untwisting the cord; a sound resembling that of the bull-roarer proper is thus produced.1 Every one of the principal New Grange "ornaments" can thus be explained in a simple and natural way, as referring to the worship that centered in its dark recesses. Even the quartered lozenge (fig. 4 b), which in the days when I believed in the Cretan theory I imagined to be a double axe, fits into its place as an ornamented bull-roarer; the decoration of these Fig. 4.?Petroglyphs at New Grange and elsewhere. objects is a study in itself, and is always significant. Around Ungust in his tomb resounds eternally the pealing of thunder and the scream of the bull roarer; it is little wonder that the incoming Celts should have identified him with Geide Ollgothach! The conclusions here indicated involve the abandonment of everything that had been supposed to have been established as to the date of New Grange. For if New Grange be independent of the Mycenaean tombs, we can no longer use them as having a bearing on the chronological problem. We are drivei back to the internal evidence which it presents. Its alliance with the megalithi construction of the dolmens would predispose us (if the Mycenaean analogic - -1 See Haddon, Study of Man, p. 284.</page><page sequence="159">Macalister?Temair Breg; Remains and Traditions of Tara. 389 had not prejudiced us) to put its date back to the neighbourhood of the dolmen-building period; that is, to about the time of the overlap between the Stone and the Bronze Ages. The axes depicted on its walls are of the flat variety, which would accord with this early dating. The axes sculptured in certain analogous buildings in Brittany are likewise of early type. These indications incline me to put the date of New Grange back to the beginning of the Bronze Age?say about 2000?1800 B.C. And if the origin of Temair be as closely bound up with New Grange as I have endeavoured to prove, that will also be the approximate date of the beginning of the sanctuary on the Eidge. Certain gold ornaments alleged to have been found at the entrance to New Grange, and at one time in the Londesborough collection, would seem to be contradictory of this conclusion.1 It is natural at first sight to regard these as part of the loot, accidentally dropped by the Scandinavian plunderers of New Grange in the year 862 a.d. But the nature of the collection makes any such interpretation impossible. The objects could not have been associated together; they consist of two late Bronze-Age torques, a gold chain that might possibly be Middle La Tene (probably much later), and a couple of mediaeval finger-rings. At the time when these objects were bought by Lord Londesborough, the country was still excited over the Clare gold-find, and everyone was suspicious of his fellow?so much so, that statements then made about the provenance of gold objects are presumptive evidence that they came from some totally different place. The Londesborough " hoard " is clearly a dealer's " job lot," said to have come from New Grange in order to invest them with additional interest, and to cover the tracks of the finder or finders; and they have no bearing on the problems of the tmmrfus itself. The relation between New Grange and the neighbouring tumuli of Dowth and Knowth is a question on which there is as yet very little to say. When ever it becomes possible to penetrate into the arcana of the last-named hill it may be that light will be found. The exposure of the great stones on the outer kerb of New Grange is also desirable, as these are probably sculptured. The fact that the chambers at Dowth are throughout megalithic in con struction prevents us from asserting with over-excessive dogmatism what at first sight would appear the most probable theory, that Dowth was a later imitation of New Grange. The strongest argument for this view lies in the fact that the spirals of New Grange have in Dowth met with the usual fate of the spiral motive, and have broken down into concentric circles. But here 1 They are figured in Archaeologia, xxx, plate xii, and also in Lord Londesborough's Miscellanea Graphica,</page><page sequence="160">390 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy. again we must guard against too great reliance upon Mycenaean analogies. This is certainly what happens in Mycenaean art The concentric circles of later patterns are quite clearly derived from the spirals of earlier patterns, and there are some interesting transitional forms; this is a commonplace of Aegean art-history, and need not here be enlarged upon or illustrated. But can we now be sure that the spirals of New Grange are necessarily connected genealogically with the circles of Dowth ? The former may, as has been suggested, represent the rotating bull-roarer; the latter may represent the sun, The rotating bull-roarer, however, appears to be represented at Dowth in another form?as a circle with a large number of radii marked, the radii being in some cases thickened or clubbed at the outer ends. These radii may well represent the successive positions of a bull-roarer in its whirling, the thickened end being the head. A similar suggestion might be made with regard to the swastika, in which the bent ends of the arms may represent the head of the bull-roarer, slightly bent backwards, as it naturally would be in its flight through the air. The circle and radii soon develops into a wheel, which as a divine emblem has been very fully studied by Henri Gaidoz.1 There is a danger in research of this kind of spreading a new net too widely and catching too many fishes; Gaidoz himself has not wholly escaped this pitfall, when he tries to derive the rose window of a Gothic cathedral from the solar wheel. I therefore content myself here by saying that many or'most of the facts which he has collected are quite consistent with the idea that, the wheel, in later times a solar symbol, had its origin in an attempt to represent a rotating bull-roarer. A question will now naturally arise, namely, are we to reverse the relation ship hitherto supposed to have existed between New Grange and the Mycenaean tombs; is New Grange the prototype and Mycenae the copy? This is nob so impossible as at first sight it would appear to be. If the spirals at New Grange are significant and those at Mycenae merely decorative, then the former represent an older stage in development; and if the date here suggested for New Grange be accepted, then that structure is more than 500 years older than the Mycenaean dromos tombs. Moreover, such a reversal of the accepted theory would be in accordance with an important principle too :&gt;ften lost sight of in developing what I may call, the "trade-route " theory of the advance of civilization. We have seen that when a merchant from a cultured centre goes among barbarians, his purpose is to make his own fortune. It is to his interest to keep the barbarians as ignorant as he can, 1 Jjt dieu gaulois du soleil, in Bevue archeologique, ser. iii, vols, iv, v, vi (1884-5).</page><page sequence="161">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 391 and therefore he teaches them as little as possible. On the other hand, if he finds among them an art or accomplishment which appears to him desirable, he will take steps to acquire it. It follows that when a trade-route between two communities of different degrees of culture becomes a channel of civilization the culture passes as a rule from the less civilized to the more civilized. The principle doubtless sounds paradoxical, and it has a host of exceptions?such as, for example, the acquisition of guns by modern savages. It does not run counter to the principle laid down by Eivers1 that a small community of settlers of high culture can revolutionize the life of a large body of aborigines of low culture. The question of a colonization does not here come in at alL Only the brief periodical visits of traders, whose business is to take as much and to give as little.as possible, are contemplated. In such cases the aborigines derive no advantage, except when competition among the traders themselves leads them to give more than they otherwise would, in order to outbid rivals. It is this competition that has introduced firearms, brandy, and other blessings of civilization among modern savages. We cannot therefore state the principle absolutely, but must qualify it by the interjected words " as a rule." Still, it should never be forgotten, when we are concerned with the study of the influence of ancient trade-routes. I do not, however, believe that New Grange set a fashion copied by the builders of the Mycenaean tombs. Bather do they appear to me indications of a common culture, universal over Europe at the beginning of the Bronze Age. New Grange comes down to us right out of the heart of this early stage of civilization, with all its barbarism; the Mycenaean tombs are an artistic development of the model, refined by generations of local civilization. On this view of the case, the civilization that centred in Crete is only a local manifestation of the general culture of Europe during the Bronze Age. Crete and Egypt, neighbouring countries which early developed intercourse with one another, advanced each other mutually to a pre-eminent position in culture. But Cretan culture is not the parent of European culture; rather is it a brother, hypertrophied owing to a favourable geographical position. If this be so, other analogies should present themselves. We have not far to go in our search for such analogies. If we leave the chamber of New Grange, and come outside, we find a great circle of standing stones surrounding the mound. This might merely be a fence, delimiting the sacred ground belonging to the sepulchre. But if such were its only purpose, a ring-mound of earth would have been more practical?such a mound as was actually built 1 The Contact of Peoples in Essays and Studies Presented to William Midgeway. R.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C. [53]</page><page sequence="162">392 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. round the Giants' Ring, near Belfast, or round the cist of Longstone Fort, hear Naas.1 We must seek another explanation. A constant tradition associates stone circles such as this with a dance. Stonehenge is known to mediaeval writers as Chorea Gigantum. In many places tales are told of dancers who transgressed the bounds of propriety, or who broke the Sabbath, and were as a penalty turned into stone. The stone circle destroyed by St.Patrick represented "Cromm Cruaich" and hisattendant deities?that is to say, its stones were aniconic figures of deities; from which we may infer that stone circles elsewhere are groups of aniconic figures. And it is very important to notice that stone circles as a rule consist of the circle plus a single stone either inside or (more often) outside the ring, exactly corresponding to Cromm and his sub-gods. The circle called the "Piper's Stones " at Hollywood, Co. Wicklow?about four miles south of Poll a' Phuca waterfall?is of this type: and here a tale is told of how profane dancers Were turned to stone; the outer stone, which someone has tried to consecrate by carving a large cross over its top, being the "Piper" who played for the dancers. The field in which these stones stand is called Aughgraney, i.e., Aehadh Griine, "Sun-field." At Loch Gur, Co. Limerick, is a large circle, called on the Ordnance Map Rannach Cruim Duibh,2 which looks exactly as though it had been intended for a dancing-place. And in a pattern several times repeated inside New Grange, we seem to see a suggestion of such a dance at a stone circle. There is a circle of circles?just the way in which a plan of a stone circle would be roughly sketched in an archaeologist's note book?round which are traced three concentric curving lines representing the course of the dancers ; in the centre of the circle is the head of a bull-roarer (fig. 4c), indicating that the dance is accompanied by that instrument. All these lines of evidence, and others that need not be here enumerated, for they are familiar to all students, point in the direction of a dance being an important part of ancient north European religious ritual. The dance was performed diisiul, in a sunwise direction; and its meaning is perfectly clear. It was an attempt, by sympathetic magic, to keep the sun revolving in its appointed course. I conclude that the stones standing round New Grange are representations of worshippers performing an endless sun-dance round 1 Proceedings R.I.A., xxx, C, 351. 2 Both in topography and in toponomy the Ordnance Map of the Loch Gur district has to be used by archaeologists with the greatest possible caution. This meaningless name is probably a mistake for Bothanna Ghruimm Dhuibh, the " wheels of Cromm Dubh," It is not likely to be anything more important than the invention of some eighteenth century hedge schoolmaster, who had read Keating. Some of the "antiquities " marked in the map of this district are of even later invention,</page><page sequence="163">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 393 the great man buried within. It is of the same order of ideas as the thunder symbols pictured on the interior walls. New Grange is the crystallization of an eternal corroboree. Let us now cross the Continent and visit the sacred island of Delos. Here we find that down to the time of Plutarch the youths were wont to perform a remarkable dance in honour of Apollo. The dance was instituted, as legend said, by Theseus, when, on his return from Crete after slaying the Minotaur, he visited Delos and sacrificed to Apollo, dedicating rb a&lt;j&gt;p&lt;^iaiov which he had received from Ariadne.1 The dance was an imitation of the mazy wind ings of the Cretan labyrinth ; and Plutarch, on the authority of Dicaearchus, tells us that the Delians called the ceremony " the Crane Dance." The current explanation of the name, that the winding twists of the dance were suggestive of the grotesque bowings and dancings characteristic of cranes, is surely insufficient. For why should cranes be taken as the model to follow ? The most probable answer to this is that cranes are among the most conspicuous of the migratory birds. They winter in Central Africa and other hot countries; but return northward in early spring. Thus the crane might very early become associated with the re-birth of the warm season; and a dance in which the peculiar motions of the bird were imitated would be a magical ceremony designed to hasten the coming of the spring. We are to understand that originally the dancers personated cranes, probably dressed up as the birds, just as the girls of Brauron dressed up as bears in honour of Artemis.2 The same or a similar dance was to be found in Crete, as Homer3 and Pausanias4 tell us. The latter writer, enumerating the works of Daedalus, names Ariadne's Dance in white marble at Cnossos. This brings the labyrinth dance into close connexion with the Minotaur.5 A dance in one island of the Aegean connected with the name of Theseus, and another dance on another island of the Aegean connected with the name of Ariadne, especially when both are of a " labyrinthine " nature, are almost of necessity different local manifestations of one and the same rite. It follows that the dance round the bull-god called the Minotaur was a " Crane-dance," even though cranes are not mentioned in connexion with the Cretan rite. 1 Plutarch, Theseus xxi. The a&lt;ppo$i&lt;riov is doubtfully interpreted as being a statue of Aphrodite. 2 The Encyclopaedia Britannica, eleventh edition (xxvi, 838 a), quotes P. S. Pallas, Btise durch verschiedene Provinzen des Bussischen Beichs, iii, 1778, as an authority for a crane-dance among the Ostiaks of Siberia, in which the dancers are dressed up with the skins and heads of cranes. 3 Iliad, xviii, 590. 4 IX, xl, 3. 6 For a discussion of the Ariadne dance and its meaning, see Frazer, The Dying God, p. 75. [58*]</page><page sequence="164">394 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Now when so unusual a combination as a bull and cranes occurs, in two different places, it is impossible to suppose that there is nothing more than a coincidence involved. There must be some radical connexion between tarvos trigaranos of the Paris altar, on which a bull is depicted with three cranes on its back, and these dances of the Aegean islands.1 But it is hardly to be supposed that the folk-lore of the Minotaur has travelled to Paris, or that the folk-lore of Tarvos Trigaranos has travelled to the Aegean ; here again we are to regard them both as local phases of a universal European cult. Tarvos Trigaranos stands, on the altar, under a great tree. His essential connexion with the Dond Cualnge has long ago been pointed out by D'Arbois de Jubainville; we must not forget the alternative name given to the Bull of Cualnge in Lebor na ccert?W\Q Ball of Oak son of Oak, on whose flesh the aborigines of Ulidia celebrated a communal feast. Since the researches of Frazer and others, the importance of the oak as a solar emblem has been fully established. The bull of the oak is therefore a solar bull, and the dance of the bull is a solar dance. That the Minotaur is a solar being has been shown by Cook and others.2 The crane dance of Delos therefore links on to the dance depicted in the standing stones around New Grange. In a paper like the present we must be content with indicating the arguments thus in bare outline. It is possible that the same combination of crane and solar symbols is to be seen once more in the well-known type of ornament found on buckets and shields from Eastern Europe and as far north as Denmark, belonging to the end of the Bronze and the beginning of the Iron Age. This consists of a circle, doubtless representing the sun-disc, flanked by the fore-parts of two birds with long necks and beaks, back to back. The design much resembles the Egyptian pattern of a sun-disc, or a royal cartouche, flanked by two uraei, and may well have been suggested in the first place by a stray Egyptian scarab. The birds are commonly identified with swans, but they can just as well be cranes.3 The idea underlying the figure may be the returning sun borne on the backs of the home-coming migrant birds. " The crane's aerial journeys are of a very extended kind ... its flocks may be descried passing overhead at a marvellous height . . . while the seeming order with which its ranks are marshalled during flight has long attracted attention."4 Birds of such habits as these might well be regarded as bringing back the summer sun. 1 The coincidence has been noticed, though without comment, by Mr. Cook: Transactions Oxford Congress of Heligions, ii, 186. See also Zeus, vol. i, p. 482, where a similar combination of cranes and the sun is cited from Japan. 2 See Cook's Zeus, vol. i, p. 490 ff. 3 Illustrations will be found in Dechelette, Manuel, ii, p. 427. * Encyclopaedia Britattnica, s. v.

This form closely resembles a type of petroglyph common in this country, consisting of a series of concentric circles sur rounding a central cup-hollow, with a single radial groove cutting across the circles and projecting outside them (fig. 4e). This analogy was first pointed out, so far as I am aware, in an otherwise eccentric and unconvincing book j1 but in spite of the shortcomings of the setting, the comparison is in my opinion sound. It is not to be supposed that the petroglyphs are copied from specimens of the coins that have found their way into Northern Europe. There are chronological difficulties in the way of such an idea, as well as psychological difficulties. I cannot believe that the bronze-age inhabitants of the district round Lochgilphead in Argyllshire, let us say?where such petroglyphs occur almost by the hundred?were so delighted with the labyrinthine patterns on a chance Cretan coin which came their way that they took the trouble to copy them endlessly on hard rock. The figure must have had a real living meaning for the Lochgilphead people to have induced them to expend so much labour. As in the case of the New Grange spirals, we explain the related patterns as cognate, but not affiliated. They have the same meaning? the crystallization of a sun-dance; but the northern carvings remain rude and barbarous y the Cretan coins are civilized into an artistic form. Attention is also called, in Dr. Krause's book,2 to the Roman " Troy " game, founded on -a labyrinth, and to certain labyrinths marked out in the earth, especially in Scandinavia, Finland, and Lapland. I am not quite clear what place these have in the scheme; for one thing, their history and their date appear to be very uncertain. Returning to the petroglyphs, especially important is a series at Mevagh, Co. Donegal, if we can trust the accuracy of the drawing which has been published of these remarkable designs.3 Some of them represent groups of circles with two radial grooves, only one of which reaches the outer circumference. It is, in fact, a labyrinth with one entrance, but with a complication in the interior suggested (fig. 4/). There is another conventional type of the labyrinth as figured on Cretan stones, designed on the basis of the swastika. If there be anything in what was just now suggested, that the swastika is an attempt to represent the whirling bull-roarer, and if the sculpture in New Grange may be taken as indicating that the bull-roarer accompanied the sun-dance, this form of the Cretan design becomes the more intelligible. 1 Die Trojaburgen Nordeuropas by Dr. Ernst Krause. Glogau, 3893. 2 This work is not easily accessible in the libraries of this country, but a sufficient abstract of its contents will be found in Cook's Zeus, vol. i, pp. 481-490. 3 Journal Eoy. Hist, and Arch Assn of Ireland, IV, viii, 429.</page><page sequence="166">396 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. One of the recorded examples of the European sun-dance is of very great importance in the present connexion. I refer to the ceremony of the college of priestesses on the island of Sena, which has been already mentioned as the probable prototype of the pagan establishment at Kildare. In a familiar passage, Pomponius Mela describes this island as the seat of a company of nine priestesses, virgins, who could raise storms, transform themselves into animals, cure diseases, and foretell the future?who had, in fact, all the stock accomplishments of witches. M. Salomon Eeinach, indeed, in one of his singularly interesting essays1 has endeavoured to demonstate that Mela or, rather, the unknown authority on whom he bases his account, is untrust worthy, and that Sena and its priestesses had no real existence: partly on the ground that there is no other evidence for female ministrants in Celtic religion, and partly because the island is too evidently reminiscent of Circe's Isle of Aeaea. He considers that the whole story of the Sena priestesses was invented by some romancer, who sought to hring Homer's fancy into the realms of reality. But, as to the first objection, we need not assume that the priestesses were Celts?they may have been the survivals of a pre-Celtic cult: and even if they were, the idea of the ban-drui is not so foreign to Celtic literature as M. Eeinach suggests. As to the other objection, it would be just as reasonable to suggest that so far from Sena being founded on Aeaea, Aeaea, the island of the daughter of Helios in the western sea, may on the contrary be founded on Sena, the island of the Sun-priestesses in the western sea. We might even go farther, and connecting the name Circe etymologically with KvtcXoQ, regard her as a personification of a stone circle, or, more accurately perhaps, of whatever spiritual beings were conceived of as being present in the stones of a circle. Putting Homer back to the very beginning of the Iron Age in Europe, the earliest date possible, we yet have plenty of time for tin-traders to have brought the report of Sena and its priestesses to the shores of the Aegean sea; and it would not have needed a Homer to have realized its suitability as a picturesque setting for the troubles of Odysseus. But it is not so much what Mela says, as what Strabo tells us that is of importance. Mela reports the daily life and duties of the priestesses?their wind-raising, oracle-giving, and disease-healing. Strabo records what happened on the island once every year. He calls the women " Samnites," by some corruption which we need not stop to discuss f there can hardly be any doubt that the same island and the same people are intended. On a certain day in every year these women un-roofed and re-roofed their temple 1 Cultes, Mythes et Beligionst i, 195. 2 Most probably we are to read Namnctes, the name of the nearest tribe on the main land. " Samnites " would be an inadvertence easy for one familiar with Roman history.</page><page sequence="167">Macalister?Temair Breg : Remains and Traditions of Tara. 397 before sunset, each of them carrying her load. If any one of them let her burden fall, she was rent asunder by the others, and her limbs were carried round the temple with wild shouts, which were kept up till their rage was abated. Strabo or his informant?probably Pytheas?had not a very exact knowledge of the rite; indeed, it is difficult to see howT they could have obtained even the knowledge which they had, seeing that no man dared to land on the island, and that the people in the lands around would be alien in speech to the traveller.1 But even the fragmentary report which we have of this rite displays close analogies with some of the rites that we have traced at Temair and at New Grange. The unroofing and re-roofing of the temple was evidently a solar rite, and we cannot be far wrong if we assume that the day on which it was performed was Midsummer day. When the sun shone longest and hottest, the temple was opened to entrap as much as possible of the sun's rays, and then was closed again. Prebably there was a perpetual fire kept alight in the temple, which was supposed to be quickened by, or else to quicken, the sun. Then, the fate of the woman who dropped her load was simply the fate of every divine king who was getting too old for his work.2 She was torn in pieces, as the king of Temair was killed when a stronger than he pame to contend with him. The tearing of the unfortunate creature in jpieces, and the bearing of her limbs round the temple, have analogies else where : all such rites have for their purpose the increase of the fertility of the soil. The island of Sena, then, was a place where women's rites, analogous to the men's rites of Temair, were carried out, and for an analogous purpose. Temair is thus set in its place as the Irish example of a universal European cultus. To come down to later times in the Greek world, we may perhaps trace some relics of this European cultus in certain of the rites of the Eleusinian mysteries. Even to touch the fringe of this gigantic subject would swell unduly a paper which has already far transgressed the limits that I had expected it to occupy. But it may be noticed that the bull-roarer, called 1 Imperfect information due to this cause is perhaps responsible for the inconsistency which is the chief difficulty in the way of reconciling the accounts of Mela and Strabo. Mela describes the Sena priestesses as vowed to perpetual virginity: Strabo reports his islanders as sailing over to the mainland when they desired to have intercourse with the opposite sex. He then proceeds to describe the temple rite : which suggests the possi bility that such intercourse may have been an essential part of the rite in question. We are reminded of what was said above as to the necessity for the marriage of the king of Temair. 2 Just as the king of Onitsha on the Niger was " immediately deposed and perhaps stoned " when he was no longer able to dance publicly with a sack of stones on his back at au annual feast; See Frazer, Taboo and the Perils of the Soid, p. 123.</page><page sequence="168">398 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. polios, was one of the toys of Dionysus shown solemnly to the initiates: that the daubing of the initiates with clay, afterwards washed off again, seems to be essentially a re-birth ritual, analogous to the ritual of the stones of Blocc and Bluicne: and that the reverent exhibition of an ear of corn reminds us of the sanctuary in the far north-west which was founded, as the story went, by Tea grand-daughter of " Com." We have already indicated how the Persephone myth can be traced in the confused stories told about the Irish princess. Here for the present I leave the subject. I close by stating a conviction which this study has impressed upon myself more strongly than ever before: that a knowledge of Irish tradition and Irish archaeology is essential to a full comprehension of Classical antiquity. In Crete and in Classical Greece we see the highest manifestations of the native civilization of Europe. Probably nowhere better than in Ireland can we study the crude materials of which that civilization was composed, and by which it can be interpreted. NOTE ADDED IN PEESS. The statement made on p. 278, that no survey of the site before Petrie's exists, must be modified. Mr. Westropp has called my attention to a brief description and sketch in Bishop Pococke's Tour in Ireland (ed. Stokes, 1891, p. 177). The sketch is distorted in the printed copy, and must be corrected by reference to the MS. original, in T.C.D. Library (14 15, page 116). This volume is not, apparently, the autograph ; it seems to be a transcript made by some scribe, neat-fingered but not over-intelligent, as is indicated by his writing Dunfany for the familiar name Bunsany (misreading the long s) a few lines before the passage which specially interests us. This, as well as the overwhelming probability that the bishop is writing entirely from memory, must be borne in mind in criticising the description, which is not a little puzzling. It runs thus : " I saw five barrows in this situation? North o o o o o on which it is possible the five kings sat .... on the southern one is a stone or pillar set up" [I omit for brevity some speculative matter of no importance].</page><page sequence="169">Macalister?Temair Breg: Remains and Traditions of Tara. 399 It is not easy to -identify the five mounds which Pococke here indicates. They might be Pupall Adamnain; Duma na Bo (Petrie's mound, now missing) side by side with Duma na nGiall; Tech Cormaic; and Mur Tea. This would be interesting for two reasons. It would prove the existence of Mur Tea, now almost disappeared, on 6 August 1753, the date of Pococke's visit; and it would indicate the (a priori not improbable) fact, that the stone of inauguration then stood, not, as Petrie's local informants told him, on Duma na nGiall, but on the traditional foundress's grave. But there are difficulties in the way of this, for the literary evidence is to the effect that Fal was on or beside Duma na nGiall. If, however, we are to call Pococke's southern mound Duma na nGiall on account of the presence of the stone, we should have difficulties in identifying the four to the north of it (the end of Tech Midchuarta, Doll, Dorcha, and Pupall Adamnain, seems the only possible series of identifications; but evidently this is strained), and it would be hard to explain how the Bishop came to miss the conspicuous structures in R&amp;ith Rig. Suppose the mound with the stone is Tech Cormaic (Petrie's Forrad], which would contradict Petrie's story that the stone had been transferred after the rebellion of 1798, then the mounds might be Pupall Adamnain, Petrie's Duma na Bo, Duma na nGiall, and either my Duma na Bo or the Forrad. It seems impossible to get any nearer to certainty than this, and whatever scheme we adopt presents difficulties. Pococke probably had the privilege of seeing the mounds in an even more perfect condition than Petrie, but he lost the opportunity of making himself useful. The Bishop also notes the standing stone in the churchyard; the figure upon it reminded him of a " German deity " whom he calls " Pusterus"? a name which in my ignorance I never met with before !
