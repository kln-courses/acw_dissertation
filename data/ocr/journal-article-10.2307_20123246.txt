THE DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY RE-EXAMINED I Today, three quarters of a century after having been chal lenged by Emile Boutroux's affirmation of real contingency in nature, the doctrine of necessary causal connection still represents a dividing line separating minds not only in phi losophy, but also in psychology, biology and physics. The persistent efforts which are being made to interpret the most recent results in physics in a way which would save the classical principle of causality indicate the presence of a fixed deep-seated belief possessing the strength and emotional intensity common to all prejudices. What more than a half century ago was called by John Dewey "the superstition of necessity" still dominates the number of intellectually honest thinkers who are sincerely convinced that any revision of the classical principle of causality would bring about the "ruin of science" and "suicide of reason." It is this cherished "doc trine of necessity" which induced such philosophers as L?on Brunschwicg and Hans Driesch to distrust the implications of modern physical theories.1 The philosophically minded physicists have pointed out that the opposition to the correct interpretation of Heisenberg 's principle stems mainly from the philosophical faith according to which every probability in nature is of subjective origin, being always nothing but a gap in our knowledge and never "a gap in the order of nature." 2 This only shows that a fruitful discussion of the 1 L.

Driesch expressed his negative attitude toward modem physics in his hook Relativit?tstheorie und Weltanschaung, 1930 and in his address "Naturwissenschaft und Philosophie" given at the philosophical congress at Prague in 1934. 2 Jean-Louis Destouches, Physique moderne et la philosophie, Paris, Hermann &amp; Cie, 1939, p. 39-40; Louis de Broglie, "L?on Brunschwicg et l'?volution des sciences," Revue de M?taphysique et de Morale, 1945.

The problem is obviously of wider scope and significance than the present discussion in physics indicates. Nevertheless it is true that this discussion succeeded where the previous efforts of Renouvier, Cournot, Bergson, Peirce, Dewey and James failed, especially among the scientists: it again focussed the attention of philosophers and scientists on the problem of causality and showed that the necessitarian dogma is, to put it mildly, less justified than was generally believed. We shall realize better the strength of the general human belief in the idea of necessary connection, if we remember that it is as old as human speculative thought itself. We find it at the very dawn of Western thought, stated explicitly and unambiguously by Democritus: "By necessity are foreordained all things that were and are and are to come." Twenty-two centuries later Laplace in the famous and frequently quoted passage of his Th?orie analytique de la probabilit? expressed the same strictly deterministic view based on essentially the same corpuscular-kinetic conception of the universe as that of Democritus : An intellect which at a given instant knew all the forces with which nature is animated, and the respective situations of the beings that compose nature ? supposing the said intellect were vast enough to subject these data to analysis ? would embrace in the same formula the motions of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the slightest atoms: nothing would be uncertain for it, and the future, like the past, would be present to its eyes. 3 The only difference between Democritus and Laplace was that mechanics of the nineteenth century had an incomparably more efficient, more complex and more accurate equipment at its disposal than the Greek atomists. It was this difference to which the more precise form of Laplace's statement as well as his emphasis on prediction was due. Only purely human limitations prevent us from extending accurate mathematical 3 uvres compl?tes, vol. VII, Paris 1886, p. 6.</page><page sequence="3">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 13 anticipation of events to the whole universe and its future history. This is the reason why the mind of an astronomer predicting accurately the date of eclipses is, according to Laplace, only a "faint replica" of the universal omniscient intellect. Laplace's formula was frequently quoted and several times restated in a more concrete and colorful way in order to make it fully clear that not only all details of inorganic nature, but also even the most specific and apparently the most "con tingent" occurrences of human history are necessary parts of one and the same network of causes and effects. According to Du Bois Reymond, the Laplacean intellect from its immense all-embracing system of simultaneous differential equations would be able to derive the most insignificant details as well as the most decisive and important events of history, no matter whether they are located in ''the past" or in "the future"; thus he would know whether the sky was cloudy on the day when Pericles embarked in Piraeus for Epidaurus, when the Greek orthodox cross will be posted on the top of the mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople, or when Great Britain will burn the last piece of its coal.4 Obviously, social history was thus conceived as a special case of physical history. The human body and its nervous system is nothing but a very complex organization of the same elementary atoms as those present in so-called inorganic nature, and Hyppolite Taine was only consistent in extending the Laplacean formula to the "nervous particles" as well.5 This idea of rigid determinism penetrated even into the literature where the topic "It could not have been otherwise" became very popular. To name only two famous examples: Tolstoi's philosophical epilogue to War 4 E. Du Bois Reymond, "?ber die Grenzen des Naturerkennens," in Wissenschaftliche Vortr?ge, edited by James H. Gore, Boston &amp; London, 1896, p. 38. The original date of this address (1872) explains the belief in the coming conquest of Constantinople by Russians. 5 H. Taine, De l'intelligence, I, p. 173: "Au mieux, en supposant la science compl?te, on entrevoit une formule math?matique, capable de r?sumer en une loi les diverses positions et relations de toutes les par ticules nerveuses."</page><page sequence="4">14 Milic Capek and Peace is inspired by the same idea of universal predeter mination as the speeches of Dr. Socrates in Anatole France's L'Histoire Comique who claimed that the whole cosmical past conspired to make the suicide of M. Chevalier necessary: "The human mechanism is only a particular instance of the universal mechanism." 6 It would be, however, a mistake to associate the neces sitarian theory exclusively with the mechanistic or naturalistic view of nature. The evidence of belief in complete determina tion of the future can be found in many idealistic systems. Long before Laplace, Leibniz was convinced that a sufficiently powerful and deep insight into "the inner parts of Being" would provide us with ability to see the future in the present "as in a mirror." 7 Immanuel Kant, a celebrated defender of human freedom, in one passage of his Critique of Practical Reason applied the Laplacean formula before Laplace not only to the human body, but even to an individual human mind.8 This will appear less paradoxical, if we remember that it followed directly from Kant's insistence of applying the category of 6 "To call upon a poor wretch to answer for his actions ! Why, even when the solar system was still no more than a pale nebula, forming, in the ether, a fragile halo, whose circumference was a thousand times greater than the orbit of Neptune; we had all of us, for ages past, been fully conditioned, determined, and irrevocably destined, and your responsibility, my responsibility, Chevalier's and that of all men, had been not mitigated, but abolished beforehand. All our movements, the results of previous movements of matter, are subject to the laws which govern the cosmic forces, and the human mechanism is merely a particular instance of the universal mechanism."

Even Fichte, the philosopher of the "Absolute Ego," did not hesitate to assert complete predict ability of the inner states as well as their complete determina tion: "All that I am and that I shall be, I am and I shall be in necessary fashion and it is impossible for me to be something else." 9 Friedrich Paulsen, a representative of Neo-Kantianism, apparently disrespectfully, but consistently applied the Lapla cean pattern of explanation to the mind of his master himself: The omniscient physiologist ... would explain the author of the Critique of Pure Reason just as he would explain a clock-work. In consequence of this particular arrangement of the brain-cells and of their interconnection with each other and the motor-nerves, certain stimuli exciting the retina and the tactile nerves of the fingers had to occasion certain movements, which are in no wise different from those of a writing automaton or a music-box.10 It is obvious that the doctrine of psycho-physical paral lelism in eliminating the possibility of any interaction between consciousness and matter found the most welcome support in the Kantian claim that the category of causality should be applied rigorously to the material processes, including the neural processes in the head of the sage of K?nigsberg. But even the opponents of the parallelist doctrine were not always opposed to the necessitarian hypothesis; Hans Driesch, although opposing mechanical explanation in biology, was very outspoken in drawing a sharp line between vitalism and indeterminism; in one passage of his Die Philosophie des 9 J. G. Fichte, Die Bestimmung des Menschen ( S?mmtliche Werke, Berlin, 1845, II, 182-3): "Dieser mein Zusammenhang mit dem Naturganzen ist es, der das bestimmt, alles was ich war, ^was ich bin und was ich sein werde und derselbe Geist w?rde aus jedem m?glichen Momente meines Daseins unfehlbar folgen k?nnen, was ich vir demselben gewesen sei, und was ich nach demselben sein werde. Alles was ich ja bin und werde, bin ich und werde ich schlechthin notwending, und es ist unm?glich, das ich etwas anderes sei." 10 F. Paulsen, Introduction to Philosophy, translated by F. Thilly, New York, 1898, p. 88.</page><page sequence="6">16 Milic Capek Organischen he claims the possibility of complete prediction of the future course of the world in truly Laplacean fashion provided that the present state of inorganic nature plus the present states of all entelechies and psychoids is completely and unambiguously known.11 We could have hardly a more revealing illustration showing that necessitarianism is not a feature belonging exclusively to a mechanical or materialistic conception of reality. It is evident that the doctrine of absolute necessity implying integral predetermination of the future is a far more general trend in philosophy, common to naturalism as well as to idealism, at least in their classical forms. A short glance at the history of philosophy shows that this conclusion is less paradoxical than it may appear. Neces sitarianism appeared three times in the history of Western thought. We have already linked the name of Democritus with the name of Laplace, thus indicating that the modern version of strict determinism was in all essential features a revival of its first Greek form. Although the distance between the purely speculative atomism of the Abderite and the empir ically established atomism of Dalton and of the kinetic theory of matter is great, the agreements in essential points far outweigh the differences in details. Even the differences in method are less conspicuous if we take into consideration the speculative origins of modern atomism in the seventeenth century and its historical connections with Democritus and Lucretius. Reality was conceived by modern as well as by ancient atomists as made of qualitatively homogeneous particles moving through empty space according to the fixed laws of mechanics; the differences of quality were explained by dif 11 "Eine h?chste Vernunft, welche mit allen Tatsachen der anor^ ganischen Natur bekannt w?re und auch alle intensive Mannigfaltigkeit aller Entelechien und Psychoide, einschliesslich der individuellen Ges chichte der letzteren, kennen w?rde, w?re imstande, die Handlungen eines Psychoids mit absoluter Sicherheit vorauszusagen. Eine solche Voraussage w?re ihr ebenso m?glich wie im Gebiete der reinen Mechanik, f?r welches diese Wahrheit bekanntlich in der Fiction des Xaplaceschen Geistes' ihre Ausdruck gefunden hat."

In the period separating Democritus from "Democritus reviviscens" 13 another form of necessitarianism cropped up in the theological doctrine of predestination. It was hardly less rigid than its Greek pred ecessor and its modern mathematico-naturalistic replica; all verbal concessions made by the theologians to the notion of liberum arbitrium were inspired by considerations essentially foreign to the doctrine itself and as incompatible with it as Lucretius' "clinamen" was with the logic of the original atomism of Democritus. The modern doctrine of absolute necessity is thus, in the words of Charles Hartshorne, a result of the "secret alliance" between theological and naturalistic deter minism.14 This convergence of two lines of thought which are appar ently so different today will appear less strange, if traced to their common source; both spring in the last analysis from the Eleatic doctrine of Being as immutable and single. The kinship of Eleatic monism and Greek atomism is generally recognized: it was Democritus who smashed the Parmenidean sphere into small bits and scattered them over the empty space where they moved along their predetermined paths. The Eleatic conservation of Being thus became the law of conserva tion of matter ? which was fairly accurately anticipated by 12 Although the atomism of Dalt?n was qualitative, it was always hoped that the qualitative differences between the chemical elements were not irreducible, but were due in the last analysis to the differences of con figuration of the more elementary particles. Spencer, Comte and Wundt shared this belief, while the hypothesis of the origin of all elements from hydrogen was proposed by Prout as early as in 1815 (E. Meyerson, Identit? et R?alit?, 4th edition, Paris, 1932, pp. 266-68). The electron theory of matter fulfilled these expectations. 13 The name of the book published by Joannes Chrysostomus Magnenus in Italy in 1646. 14 C.

Only confusion in cos mological ideas prevented the correct anticipation of the laws of mechanics, especially the law of inertia. The connection between Eleatic monism and Western theology is less trans parent, although no less real. There is no place here for a more detailed historical analysis; the main outline will be, I hope, sufficient. It can hardly be denied that the fusion of the idea of God with that of the Eleatic One, first proposed by Euclides of Megara and then accepted by Plato and Plotinus, left an ineffa?able mark on the formation of the Western theology. In spite of all differences between Aris totelianism and Neo-Platonism, the idea of God has essentially the same Eleatic features in both systems; that is why all prominent Christian philosophers like St. Augustine, Johannes Scotus Eriugena, St. Anselm and St. Thomas had a tendency to conceive God as a single, timeless and indivisible Being whose perfection is precisely due to its immutability. For every change was conceived as a corruption unworthy of pure and perfect Being. Unquestionably, the difficulties, especially religious difficulties, which they faced were enormous and it is almost pathetic to see for instance St. Thomas trying desperately to reinject life and personality into his static divine substance in order to narrow the gap between the abstract and dead "Ens" and the living God of the Bible and the early Christians.15 By identifying God with timeless Being, the 15 See The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, part I, especially Q. IX, Art. 1, where God is conceived to be altogether immutable and Q. XVIII, Art. 3 where it is claimed that life can be properly attributed to God. These obviously contradictory propositions are rec onciled in purely verbal fashion, the life of God being defined as "movement by itself and to itself." Similarly, by his will and love God wills and loves his own essence (QQ. XIX,XX); his self-will and self-love are hardly more than metaphorical expressions for timeless identity of his own substance which posits itself eternally. St. Thomas himself quotes Aristotle's Ethics: "God rejoices by an operation that is one and simple" (Q. XX, Art. 1) and thus anticipates almost verbatim the proposi tion of Spinoza's Ethics: "Deus se ipsum amore intellectual infinito amat" (Ethica, V, prop. XXXV).</page><page sequence="9">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 19 theologians consistently put even his wisdom and knowledge beyond time. His knowledge, being not limited by time, is necessarily foreknowledge as well; it embraces the past, present and future in his timeless insight of eternal wisdom; all temporal distinctions disappear in the omniscient unity of his "Eternal Now." Foreknowledge implies predestination; the development of the imperfect world in time is nothing but a gradual unfolding of the program all of whose details are laid down by omniscient and foreordaining Divine Providence. The transition from the theological determinism to its modern and naturalistic form was gradual. The most important intermediate stage was the pantheism of Bruno and Spinoza. As long as the dualism of God and nature seemed to have its justification in the geometrical and physical structure of the Ptolemean universe, that is, in the sharp distinction of the celestial and sublunar world, the lurking pantheism of medieval theology had little chance to be formulated explicitly. Bruno, in removing the last celestial sphere of the fixed stars still retained by Copernicus, removed this obstacle and, fascinated by the unity and infinity of nature in space, paved the way for Spinoza's "Deus sive natura" which replaced the former "Deus et natura." But no matter how deeply transformed the concept of God appeared in Bruno's pantheistic reinter pretation, it still retained the same Eleatic feature, present in Neo-Platonism and medieval theology: its timelessness. "The Divine Spirit," writes Bruno in his Summa Terminorum Meta Physicorum, "sees all things in one single act at once, that is without the distinction between the past, present and future; everything is present to him." 16 As in the previous systems, the notion of divine foreknowledge implied inexorably the notion of divine foreordaining, which in Bruno's pantheism became an immanent determinism of nature. But this determinism stemmed also from a different source: from the revived influence 16 "Sicut et mens divina uno actu simplicissimo in se contemplatur omnia simul sine successione, id est absque differentia prateriti, praesentis et futuri; omnia quippe illi sunt praesentia..." (Jordani Bruni Nolani opera latine conscripta, Florentiae, 1889, vol. I, 4, chapter XIV, pp. 32-3.)</page><page sequence="10">20 Milic Capek of Greek atomism whose main vehicle in the times of the Renais sance before the rediscovery of Democritus was Lucretius' De Rerum Natura.11 It was to Lucretius ? needless to say, to Lucretius without his "clinamen" ? that Bruno owed his adherence to the atomic theory with both its essential features: the qualitative unity of matter and its quantitative preservation. Thus matter, which in Neo-Platonism was nothing more than a principle of negativity and passivity, in becoming "cosa divina," regained its status of the first principle. In spite of the imper fections in details, Bruno's system anticipated the classical New tonian scheme of nature, monistic and deterministic at the same time, by almost purely speculative and imaginative means with amazing accuracy. We can trace the merging of the same influences in the thought of Spinoza: medieval thought, Christian as well as Jewish, Neo-Platonism, revived Greek atomism and the nascent science of the seventeenth century joined together to produce one of the most powerful systems of thought.18 While the 17 On the influence of Lucretius on Bruno, see W. Boulting, Giordano Bruno, London 1914, passim; G. D. Hadzsits, Lucretius and His Influence, New York 1935, pp. 279-83. On Bruno's anticipations of later physical and astronomical discoveries, see Boulting, 1. c, pp. 141-46; Harald H?fding, A History of Modern Philosophy (English translation by B. E. Meyer, 1900), pp. 123-30. 18 Spinoza's letter to Hugo Boxel (Opera, IV, Ep?stola LVI) shows that he was clearly aware of his debt to the ancient atomists. He recalls Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius, who showed "the futility of hidden qualities, intentional species, substantial forms and thousand other trifles" and he especially praises Democritus all of whose books were burned by his envious opponents. Spinoza's firm belief that the kinetic-corpuscular conception of matter had been firmly established long time ago and that it does not need to be verified empirically, led him to consider Boyle's experiments as more or less superfluous. Spinoza's philosophy of matter differs from the ancient atomism in only one important point; there is no limit to the divisibility of corpuscles because all bodies are conceived in Cartesian fashion as "modes of extension" and thus share with geometrical space its mathematical continuity. Nevertheless, in his rejection of the secondary qualities (Ethica, I, appendix) and in his attempt to reduce all apparent qualitative diversity in matter to the differences in motion and configuration (Ep?stola VI), Spinoza's attitude was essentially Democritean, like that of all his great contemporaries in the seventeenth century.</page><page sequence="11">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 21 anticipatory genius of Bruno hardly embraced the intellectual development of one century subsequent to his death, the extent and accuracy of Spinoza's anticipations reached far deeper into the future. His fundamental thesis affirming the unity of nature and the rigid necessity of its immanent divine order agrees with that of Bruno and hardly represents anything basically new. The originality of Spinoza consisted in boldly and ruthlessly drawing all consequences from these two basic ideas ? which are really one in two aspects ? and thus outlining the program which particular sciences began to realize long after his death. There are four main consequences of his deterministic monism: 1. Causal order is of a logico-mathematical nature. Causal necessity is that of logical implication. 2. Every contingency is only apparent and due exclusively to the subjective limitation of knowledge. To use the term "possible" is a sign of ignorance.19 3. Deterministic explanation has to be extended to the whole of nature, including the areas labeled "life" and "mind." Man himself is not a "realm inside of a realm," but a necessary part of the whole. All teleological ex planations are anthropomorphic and have to be elimi nated. 4. Duality of mind and body is a duality of aspect, not of substance. There is no interaction between conscious ness and matter because of their strict phenomenal parallelism. For the same reason it is meaningless to speak of consciousness without reference to its accom panying bodily state. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss the last two points. They are closely related to the first two; it is in the name of the uninterruptedness of the causal series in nature that strict psycho-physical parallelism has been postulated and every contingency in nature, that is, every intervention of an imma terial or teleological agent, strictly banished. For our purpose it is sufficient to say that Darwinism and physiological psychol 19 Ethica, I, prop. XXXIII, scholium 1: "At res aliqua nulla alia de causa contingens dicitur, nisi respectu defectus nostrae cognitionis."</page><page sequence="12">22 M Hic Capek ogy as late as two centuries after Spinoza's death began to fill the general frames of explanation prepared by him with concrete empirical material. Only in the second half of the nineteenth century Spencer, Wundt, Bain, Maudsley, Taine, Ribot, Janet, Mach and many others in a concrete and detailed way applied the principles of parallelistic and physiological psychology laid down by Spinoza 20 while mechanistic biology was believed to have found a deadly weapon in the principle of natural selection capable to dispose once for all of all "stupid amazement" which, according to the author of the Ethics, the complexity of organic bodies awakens in a vulgar imagination.21 This certainly explains why a more general recognition of the true value of Spinoza's system among the scientists did not come before the second half of the nineteenth century. But it is Spinoza's conception of the causal order which is our main concern here. According to Leucippus and Democritus, necessity is conceived as an external compulsion by which one material particle is pushed by another one. Spinoza retained this view only in his physics, or, in his own terminology, in the 20 It can be hardly denied that the solution of the traditional mind body problem proposed by the theory of psycho-physical parallelism (called the "automaton theory" by W. James) was in all essential features Spinozi stic. After Descartes, and even more after Kant, it was difficult to dismiss the reality of consciousness altogether; but, on the other hand, in the times of Newton and especially in the century of Helmholtz and R. Meyer it was practically impossible to conceive a non-physical factor interrupting the continuous causal series inside of our bodies. Thus the parallelists as well as Spinoza recognized the reality of consciousness without falling into traditional dualism and interactionism: they deprived consciousness of its causal efficacy without denying it in materialistic fashion. Undoubt edly, many adherents of the "double aspect theory," for example Spencer, Bain and others, were not even aware of their own Spinozism; others, like Wundt, while admitting the basic similarities between their theory and that of Spinoza, insisted on the difference between their "empirical" attitude and the rationalistic metaphysics of their predecessor; still others, like Taine and Mach were fully and proudly aware of their debt to the author of the Ethics. 21 Ethica, I, appendix; "Sic etiam, ubi corporis humani fabricam vident, stupescunt, et ex eo, quod tantae artis causas ignorant, concludunt, eandem non mec?nica, sed divina, vel supernaturali arte fabrican, talique modo constitu?, ut una pars alteram non laedat."</page><page sequence="13">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 23 realm of "modifications of extension"; 22 but this mechanical causality of the physical world together with the corresponding causality of the parallel mental phenomena was for him only an unfolding of the timeless logical pattern existing eternally in the divine substance. Everything follows from the infinite substance by logical necessity, comparable to the necessity of a geometrical demonstration; the theorem concerning the internal angles of a triangle is timelessly implied in the logical definition of triangle itself, even though a finite mind is unable to perceive it instantaneously, forced as he is to proceed laboriously step by step. While human reasoning thus unavoidably takes place in time, in eternity there is no "before" and "after," but only a "simul totum" of static logical implication. This implication is mutual; not only, using Spinoza's example, does the definition of a triangle imply its properties statable in specific theorems, but also the property of having internal angles equal to 180 degrees implies the triangularity of a corresponding geometrical figure.23 Thus not only does the substance imply a particular mode, but also even the most insignificant modus implies the whole substance; therefore, in Spinoza's own words which reveal the striking and ruthless logic of his own system, the destruction of one single particle of matter would imply the destruction of the whole material universe.24 22 Ethica, II, Lemma III. It is hardly anything more than a restatement of the law of inertia with explicit requirement that every external factor modifying the state of motion of a certain body must itself be of mechanical, i.e., corpuscular, nature. On Spinoza's lively interest in the problems of the seventeenth century science, see R. McKeon, The Philosophy of Spinoza, Longmans Green and Co. London and New York, 1928, ch. IV. 23 Ethica, I, prop.

Of course, nothing would be more na?ve than to imagine that Spinoza's metaphysics had any historical influence on the development of physics. The opposite is true: it was the nascent mathematical physics of the seventeenth century with its ideal of deducibility of the whole series of effects from one single mathematical formula which profoundly impressed Spinoza and whose deeper philosophical meaning was readily grasped by his perceptive mind. His view of causality was certainly a happy intuition, though not an incidental one; with the perspi cacity of genius he simply discerned the coming trend in physics and sciences in general.25 His infinite substance thus became a 25 It is frequently overlooked that Spinoza, in spite of his medieval ties, belonged to the seventeenth century and that his thought did not escape the influence of the intellectual climate created by Galilei, Kepler, Descartes, Newton and Huyghens. The influence of Descartes as philos opher is generally admitted, but seldom that of Descartes as a scientist who founded analytical geometry and helped to lay down the foundations of mechanics and mathematical optics. Yet it cannot be denied that the geometrico-deductive method is the most conspicuous feature of Spinoza's philosophy which determined the form and even the name of his Ethics. His intense interest, however, even in such specific scientific questions as, for instance, the nature of the rings of Saturn or whether the comets move according to Kepler's laws (Epist. XXVI, XXX), shows that he was interested not only in general mathematical method, but also in its concrete physical applications. He even took an active part in theoretical research in his Algebraic Computation of the Rainbow ("Stelkonstige Reckening van den Regenboog," Opera omnia, IV) written explicitly for "the greater connection of physics and mathematics." It is therefore very probable that the growing success of the mathematical deduction in astronomy and optics which renders it possible to express the successive positions of the celestial bodies as well as the paths of the light rays in simple mathematical formulae, led him to conceive even causality in general in the same way, i.e., more geom?trico, as a timeless geometrical implication. This implication is -mutual for Spinoza as well as for Laplace. In Laplacean physics, not only every "instantaneous state of the universe* is implied by the whole cosmic past, but also the past states of the universe can be inferred from the present one; consequently, a present state not only contains virtually all future states, but it is deducible from any future state. In other words, in the same way as the Spinozean modus implies</page><page sequence="15">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 25 mediating link between the medieval omniscient God and the "universal mind" of d'Alembert and Laplace. In the same way as all future details of the history of the world are actually present in the divine intellect of the medieval theologians, all future events preexist in the impersonal and mathematical order of classical physics. Divine omniscience became immanent and depersonalized, but retained its timeless and rigorously pre determining character. Besides, in Du Bois Reymond's form ulation it was evident that certain theological reminiscences were still present in the mind of the physicists expounding the doctrine of universal necessity: "To such a mind (i.e., the Laplacean intellect) all the hairs on our head are counted and without its knowledge not a single sparrow falls to the ground." 26 II Static determinism when consistently formulated faced one difficult question: where does the temporal character, or, more accurately, the illusion of the temporal character of reality come from? What is its exact status in a rigidly determined world ? In the whole history of Western philosophy no one dared to follow Parmenides up to the last extreme in espousing his unambiguously clear and simple denial of time and change. It is true that in all three main forms of static determinism, temporal succession has been explicitly denied to Being itself, no matter whether it was called Democritian irafiirhrjpe? ?v or "Ens Realissimum" of medieval scholastics or the impersonal mathematical order of nineteenth century science. Nevertheless, the whole substance (see note 24) and vice versa, every instantaneous state of the Laplacean world contains virtually all other states, the future as well as the past, and vice versa. In both systems, the implication between the timeless whole of nature and its perishing and finite manifestation is mutual, no matter whether we call this manifestation modus or "instant^ aneous state"; in both systems the dissymmetry of time and, consequently, its successive character is irretrievably lost. 26 "Solchem Geiste w?ren die Haare auf unserem Haupte gez?hlt, und ohne seinem Wissen fiele kein Sperling zur Erde" (Wissenschaftliche Vortr?ge, edited by J.

For atomism, ancient as well as modern, change was reduced to the displacement of atoms in empty space. The atoms them selves remain unaffected by their motion, being at different instants of time always the same, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Only their mutual distances, i.e., their relations in empty space are changing; but it was infinitely significant that the empty space was called by Democritus "Non-Being," in opposition to the true and completed reality of matter, the change of the distances in the empty space being thus conceived as taking place in "Non-Being." Thus, "Non-Being," para doxical as it was, was still conceived as existing in a certain sense because it was the only way of explaining the existence of motion and to escape the radical conclusions of the Eleatic school. It was, however, evident that change itself, though not completely abolished, was admitted in the most innocuous way while not affecting the eternal sameness of the basic reality. Change and succession retained only shadowy existence, a sort of half-existence hovering hesitatingly between full Being and pure Nothing, sliding, as it were, over the smooth surfaces of the impenetrable and unchangeable atoms. Lucretius was only consistent in insisting that "time is nothing by itself." 27 In medieval theological determinism as long as the latent pantheistic tendencies were checked by the explicitly asserted distinction between God and nature, the reality of time and change was not denied at least not to the world of the created beings, even though it was inapplicable to the Creator himself. But as soon as the distinction between creating God and created nature was more and more challenged, the status of temporality began to grow dimmer. If the timeless divine order is the only true and genuine reality underlying the apparent world, where is the true locus of change and succession ? The epistemol?gica! distinctions between "appearance" and "reality" can apparently reconcile the opposition of changeless and changing. The latter belongs only to the phenomenal world, i.e., to the world as per 27 De Rerum Natura, I, pp. 459-64.</page><page sequence="17">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 27 ceived in a distorted and confused way by a finite and imperfect subject. In the words of Spinoza: God quatenus infinitus est is other than quatenus humanam mentem constitua. William James observed rightly that the system of Spinoza and all other related philosophies are worked by the word "quatenus". "Con junctions, prepositions, and adverbs play indeed the vital part in all philosophies; and in contemporary idealism the words 'as' and 'qua' bear the burden of reconciling metaphysical unity with phenomenal diversity. Qua absolute the world is one and perfect, qua relative is many and faulty, yet it is the self-same world ?instead of talking of it as many facts, we call it one fact in many aspects." 28 The reconciliation is hardly more than verbal. At least this verbal prestidigitation shows plainly that even when change and succession are declared to be illusions, they, being illusions, still remain at least psychologically real. Chased from the realm of objective reality, change and succession take refuge in the world of our inner states. No matter how illegitimate it is to project the psychological succession outside of our private "stream of consciousness," the stream itself of our mental states remains irreducibly changing and successive; otherwise the very illusion of temporality would be impossible. The removal of any illusion presupposes its previous psycho logical existence; thus I am wrong in believing in the existence of a rainbow outside of my mind, but this very error of judg ment is based on the psychological presence of the visual mental state whose reality in my consciousness cannot be denied. I can be wrong in believing that the objective succession of events corresponds to the succession of my sensations, but I cannot be wrong in experiencing this succession as a psycho logical fact because this is one on which my erroneous belief *? if it is erroneous ?* is based. Succession and change does possess undeniable reality, at least in the realm of conscious ness. Is it really undeniable ? Kant undertook the most elaborate attempt to establish that it is not so. According to him, our 28 A Pluralistic Universe, p. 47.</page><page sequence="18">28 Mille Capek mental states are ordered in their successive relations by the same a priori form of time as the events of the physical world; they do not succeed each other, they only appear to succeed and although this succession is a necessary result of the structure of our knowledge, it is nevertheless nothing more than a phenomenon which has to be carefully distinguished from "the thing-in-itself," from true reality. In Kant's own words: Time is therefore to be regarded as real, not indeed as object but as the mode of representation of myself as object. If without this condition of sensibility I could intuit myself, or be intuited by another being, the very same determinations which we now represent to our selves as alterations would yield knowledge into which the representa tion of time, and therefore also of alteration, would in no way enter. 29 This passage is obvious enough: not only the external world, but even the content of our mind is beyond time, and its succession is only a phenomenon due to our subjective limita tions. In a doctrine of this sort, "apparent duration of things expresses merely the infirmity of a mind that cannot know everything at once." 30 Remove the limitation of our sensibility which we call "time" and the appearance of succession disap pears in the all-embracing act of omniscience to which even all our mental life will appear in its timeless totality. This explains not only why Kant formulated Laplace's idea a quarter of a century before Laplace, but also why he went even further when he extended its validity to the realm of consciousness. Nevertheless, by watching Kant's reasoning closely, we can discern that temporality is not eliminated; on the contrary, the reality of succession is surreptitiously postulated in the very act which is intended to eliminate it. First, Kant artificially separates the bare act of consciousness, which is empty and changeless, from its concrete content, which is various and changing. But even when we grant this Aristotelian separation of "matter" and "form" which has been so savagely attacked 29 Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith, p. 79. The word for "alteration" in the German original is Ver?nderung. 30 H. Bergson, Creative Evolution, translated by A. Mitchell, Modern Library Edition, p. 45.</page><page sequence="19">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 29 by William James,31 and even when we agree that the objective reality underlying our external perceptions as well as our "phenomenal self" is outside of time, temporality is not elimi nated. For what prevents our transcendental timeless Ego from grasping our subjective stream of consciousness as it really is, i.e., frozen in its timeless form of the "intelligible character" ? Nothing but our subjective form of time. But where is the locus of this subjective form interposed between timeless transcen dental Ego and equally timeless "thing-in-themselves" including our true psychological self ? Kant's answer is unambigously clear, although he did not realize its implications: the subjective form of time is the way in which our awareness is affected by our real self.32 But to affect implies activity and activity implies succession, as Kant implicitly admits : I can indeed say that my representations follow one another; but this is only to say that we are conscious of them as in time-sequence, that is, in conformity with the form of inner sense. Time is not, therefore, something in itself, nor is it an objective determination inherent in things.33 In other words: if time is represented as a curtain interposed between our consciousness and reality, Kant cannot deny that the curtain gradually rises, revealing in succession what in 31 W. James, Principles of Psychology, I. After criticizing "the utter barrenness of the consciousness of the pure Self" (p. 362), James states that "Transcendentalism is only substantialism grown shame-faced, and the Ego only a cheap and nasty edition of the soul... The Ego is simply nothing: as ineffectual and windy an abortion as philosophy can know" (p. 365). 321 prefer to quote from the German original (Gesammelte Schriften, III, p. 70) : "Wenn das Verm?gen sich bewusst zu werden das, was im Gem?the liegt, aufsuchen ( apprehendieren ) soll, so muss es dasselbe afficieren und kann allein auf solche Art eine Anschauung seiner selbst hervorbringen, deren Form aber, die vorher im Gem?the zum Grunde liegt, die Art, wie das Mannigfaltige in Gem?the beisammen ist, in der Vorstellung der Zeit bestimmt; da es denn sich selbst anschauet nich wie es sich ummittelbar selbstth?tig vorstellen w?rde, sondern nach der Art wie es von innen afficiert wird, folglich wie es sich erscheint, nicht wie es ist"( Italics mine). 33 Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith, p. 79 n.</page><page sequence="20">30 Mille Capek itself (i.e., without movement of the curtain) is without succes sion. Nevertheless, the gradual rising of the curtain is still a successive process. Thus temporality banished from everywhere still in a shadowy form creeps between the timeless transcen dental Ego and timeless "intelligible character." Temporality is like the Cartesian Cogito which although denied constantly and repeatedly from the time of Leucippus to the behaviorists and physicalists of today, emerges always in the act by which it is denied. This is what Professor Lovejoy called the "paradox of the thinking behaviorist," 34 while a similar paradox which we have just analyzed can be called the "paradox of the changing Eleatic": even if time is nothing but a veil of ignorance, this veil must be lifted in order gradually to uncover the hidden timeless reality; or, without metaphor, in order to have the illusion of time, succession must have a certain ontological locus, if not consciousness where it is usually located, at least between consciousness and its content, as it is the case in the highly elaborate and sophisticated doctrine of Kant.35 Ill In view of these insurmountable difficulties which all Eleatic and quasi-Eleatic systems face, it is only natural that the large majority of determinists in the last and present century squarely accept the reality of time. This is true especially of men of science who are less concerned about metaphysical subtleties and who naturally adhere to a common sense recognition of the reality of change and succession. Heinrich Helmholtz even 34 "The Paradox of the Thinking Behaviorist," Philosophical Review, XXI. 35 Kant not only did not realize that his view of time makes all our inner experience illusory, but he apparently congratulated himself for making our existence independent of such a non-entity (Unding) as truly existing time. "... Ja m?sste sogar unsere eigene Existenz die auf solche Art von der f?r sich bestehenden Realit?t eines Undinges wie Zeit abh?ngig gemacht w?re, mit dieser in lauter Schein verwandelt werden, eine Ungereimtheit, die sich bisher noch niemand hat zu Schulden kommen lassen" (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, Werke III, p. 72). The Eleatic twist of Kant's mind here is more than obvious.</page><page sequence="21">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 31 claimed that succession is the only feature common to our private mental states and the objective world underlying our sensual perception. Time thus became the only joining link between two regions into which the "bifurcation theory" splits reality. The main question which arises now is: are necessity and tem porality logically compatible ? The answer of "common sense" is obvious: no concept is more familiar to us than the idea of a process whose phases, though necessarily determined, still distinctly succeed each other. All our thinking in the sciences, not only in astronomy and physics, but also in biology, psychology, sociology, and history is based on the idea of necessary connection in time. "It is entirely possible," says Ralph B. Perry in criticizing Bergson, "to maintain the existential priority of time and to be a vigorous determinist as well." 36 According to Perry, even a strictly determined mechanical system ages, but of course, it ages according to law; the simplest mechanical movement of a single particle all of whose future positions are completely and accurately predictable contradicts Bergson's assertion that real evolution in time and rigid necessity are incompatible. It is unquestionable that all evidences seem to support this view, at least if we restrict ourselves to the classical physics of the last century, when the success of astronomical predictions became a fascinating and ideal goal for all other areas of human knowledge. But before we consider how the situation changed in the second quarter of the present century, we have again to point out a serious difficulty which it raised by the idea of strict determination of successive events. What is the precise meaning of necessary causal connection between two successive events a and b ? It can only mean that all features of the event b which follows after event a, even those which are the most individual and apparently entirely contin 36 R. B. Perry, Present Philosophical Tendencies, New York, 1921, pp. 251-52. The very same idea that " the historic character of time does not depend on our ability to reduce the possibility of future events to a complete or partial necessity" was recently reaffirmed by C. F. von Weizs?cker, The History of Nature, University of Chicago Press, p. 137.</page><page sequence="22">32 Milic Capek gent, are logically deducible from the previous event. If we use the example mentioned by Perry of a single isolated body moving with uniform velocity, then the position of a body at an instant t together with its velocity (v := const.) and acceleration (a = 0) determines completely all its future positions and velocities. To be sure, this is an ideal case never realized in nature because there is no isolated body, not even an isolated system of bodies in the universe. But even if we take into consideration all moving and interacting particles in the universe, the picture, although tremendously more complex, will not be essentially different. The event b and the event a will be more accurately replaced by two successive states of the whole universe, each being a huge instantaneous configuration of material particles in two successive moments. This was the meaning of Laplace's famous statement which, in considering the succession of the instantaneous states of the whole universe as the only true causal chain, avoids the fallacy of an "isolated system." It is true that very frequently and for practical pur poses the fallacy is not too dangerous; in the words of John Stuart Mill no observable inaccuracy will result if during our chemical experiment we disregard the processes occurring out side of our planet and even outside of our laboratory. But, strictly speaking, these individual and approximately isolated causal processes are only parts of one single huge causal network which is a continuous succession of the instantaneous states of nature, each state implying all others. Here the difficulty comes. Every logical implication is admittedly timeless. It is a commonplace in logic to distinguish the implication itself which is beyond time from the corre sponding process of inference with its distinct successive stages. In other words, although psychologically the conclusion follows from the premises, logically it is timelessly implied or contained in the premises, and words like "antecedent," "consequent," "it follows," are essentially metaphorical and even misleading because of their obvious temporal connotations. The simulta neity of the conclusion with premises can be illustrated and even visualized by analyzing the traditional categorical syllogism:</page><page sequence="23">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 33 All M are P, all S are M, therefore all S are P. By drawing Euler's circles it becomes immediately obvious that the inclusion of the class S into the class P coexists with two "previous" inclusions, M in P and S in M; there is no succession, no movement here, except the shifting movement of our attention which after noticing the first two inclusions perceives the simul taneous inclusion of class S in P. It is certainly not necessary to restrict ourselves to this classic example; the same pr? existence of a valid conclusion in the premises is postulated also in every relational argument, in every mathematical reasoning and in every reasoning in general; it is this fact which accounts for our saying that we discover truth instead of creating it. The belief that reality itself, including all its future phases, is nothing but a single though tremendously complex pattern of pre-existing truth which is gradually and laboriously unveiled to our imperfect intellect is at the very bottom of classical deter minism. But the question now arises again: where does the succession come from ? Why is the future development of the universe, though already given and necessarily implied, not present now ? If the future logically pre-exists in the present state of the universe, why does it require a certain time to become present ? Why this strange delay which cannot be accounted for by the structure of necessary implication and which we call "time" ? Or in the words of William James: "Why, if one act of knowledge could from one point take in the total perspec tive, with all mere possibilities abolished, should there ever be anything more than that act ? Why duplicate it by the tedious unrolling, inch by inch, of the foredone reality ?" 37 For a naturalist and a common scientist this question is even more difficult because he usually refuses to follow the traditional escape-route of Spinoza, Bradley, McTaggart and others, who confine succession within the "realm of consciousness" only in order to deny its objectivity. But fortunately for his peace of mind, a deterministic scientist is most often unaware of the inherent difficulty; he simply accepts necessity together with temporality without being even interested in the question of M The Will to Believe, p. 271 ("On Some Hegelisms").</page><page sequence="24">34 Milic Capek their mutual compatibility. Very probably even Laplace, T. Huxley and Du Bois Reymond sincerely believed in the genuine reality of time without becoming aware that their belief was a simple association of ideas or rather a combination of words which when analyzed cannot possess any self-consistent mean ing. They failed to realize that temporality does not have any justifiable existence in their necessitarian scheme; that it is impossible to adhere to their doctrine and at the same time ignore its inherent logic which requires one to give up time; that, if they admit that time and succession are simply empirical ly given without being logically deducible from their own scheme, they admit contingency is essentially foreign to their system; that, consequently, their determinism ceases to be universal and is replaced by a sort of compromise which has undoubtedly the merit of not sacrificing the reality of time and change, but does not possess the logical consistency of a unified necessitarian scheme. If the rigid form of determinism is sup posed to account for all features of any future event and at the same time fails to account for its most fundamental one: its "latterness," its "posteriority," its "futurity," its "not yet," then it certainly does not merit its name. Furthermore, if the same doctrine tries to incorporate into its own body the element which is ex definitione excluded, then it ceases to be logically coherent. The incompatibility of temporality and necessity has been clearly established by the French temporalists of the second half of the nineteenth century, Jules Lequier, Charles Renouvier, Emile Boutroux, Joseph Delb uf, and Henri Bergson. They also pointed out that the necessitarian scheme by its "causa aequat effectum" eliminates every difference between an ante** c?dent and consequent and thus deprives causality of its dynamic and successive character.38 But the intellectual climate of that period was not favorable to ideas of this sort; the principle of necessary causal connection embodied in its more concrete form 38 E. Boutroux, De la contingence des lois de la nature? p. 25: "Serait-il encore un cons?quent, un effet, un changement, s'il ne diff?rait de l'ant?c?dent, ni par la quantit?, ni par la qualit? ?"</page><page sequence="25">The Doctrine of Necessity Re~Examined 35 in the law of conservation of matter and energy ("the law of persistence of force," in Spencer's terminology) was a scientific dogma which practically nobody dared to challenge and it is only now in the light of recent developments in physics that the bold views of Cournot, Boutroux and Peirce about the objective character of chance are treated with more tolerance. Minds were so dominated by necessitarian dogmatism, so fascinated by the triumph of scientific predictions and by the repeated success of mathematical deduction in the physical sciences that practically no one paid attention to Bergson when he pointed out the incompatibility of time and necessity in the concrete case of mechanical equations. In the passage of his Creative Evolution which since then has become classical, Bergson showed that the equations of mechanics are not concerned with the time interval separating the successive instants; consequently ... the flow of time may assume an infinite rapidity, the entire past, present and future of material objects or of isolated systems might be spread out all at once, without there being anything to change either in the formulae of scientist or even in the language of common sense. The number t would always stand for the same thing; it would still count the same number of correspondences between the states of the objects of systems and the points of the line, already drawn, which would be then "the course of time." 39 Then, after quoting Laplace, Bergson concludes: "In such a doctrine, time is still spoken of; one pronounces the word, but one does not think of the thing. For time is here deprived of efficacy and if it does nothing, it is nothing!" 40 Bergson probably was not entirely correct in claiming t!)at a determinist pronounces the word "time" without thinking of real succession. The state of mind of an average determinist is more complex, and it was more correctly analyzed by Bergson in his first book where he pointed out that the belief in neces sary causal connection is an association of two plainly incom patible ideas ?* that of mathematical necessity implying pre formation and even pre-existence of the future whose "futurity" thus becomes only apparent ? and that of a temporal process 89 Op. Cit., p. 12. **Ibid.t pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="26">36 Milic Capek with distinctly successive phases called respectively "cause" and "effect." 41 This association is so intimate and made so auto matic by habit and, consequently, so familiar to an average mind that its absurdity is not noticed. Progress in redefining the concept of causality can be achieved only by a more attentive analysis, psychological as well as logical, by separating the incompatible elements fused into the deceptive unity of an instinctive belief, by challenging all silent assumptions which confuse psychological familiarity with logical evidence. It was such an analysis which so many times in intellectual history paved the way to the progress of scientific insight in dissociating notions connected by apparently unbreakable associations. In a few instances, determinist philosophers became aware of the incompatibility between time and necessity. Thus Hans Driesch after stating his Laplacean belief in the predetermination of his so-called "vitalistic" universe, asks why the timeless entelechies unfold their activities in time; why the development of an individual organism from the ovum up to its adult form is not realized in one single and complex act ? He frankly admits: "To this, we have no answer." 42 It is obvious that the question concerning the legitimacy of time can arise in the neces sitarian scheme only. On the other hand, Hippolite Taine who became famous by applying strict Spinozistic determinism to the history of literature and the theory of art, nevertheless refused to follow his master in eliminating temporality when he replaced the static geometry of the Ethics by his "living geometry" (la g?om?trie vivante) without realizing that he was juxtaposing two incompatible words.43 Most frequently the 41 Essai sur les donn?es imm?diates de la conscience, pp. 161-164. 42 Philosophie des Organischen, p. 326 (Entelechie und Zeit): "Warum nun freilich braucht die Entelechie zur vollst?ndigen Volleistung der Zeit, warum geht nicht durch einen komplizierten Werdeakt, durch Entwicklung von nur einem Schritt, der Erwachsene aus dem Ei hervor ? Das wissen wir nicht." 43 Andr? Chevrillon, Taine. Formation de sa pens?e. Paris, Pion, 1932, pp. 64-65. The expression "une g?om?trie vivante" is in Taine's concluding chapter about Byron, which is Spinozistic in spirit and almost in letter (Histoire de la litt?rature anglaise, IV, p. 389).</page><page sequence="27">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 37 incompatibility between the affirmation of real novelty and deductive necessity was only vaguely felt; but this vague feeling was sufficient to find its expressions in certain peculiarities of language which were invented in order to reconcile the neces sitarian claim of the logical equivalence of cause and effect and the vague, though very strong feeling of their genuine difference resulting from their real, i.e., not merely symbolical, succession. William James, who pointed out the function of "quatenus" in the philosophy of Spinoza by which the eternity and unity of substance was to be reconciled with the realm of manifold and changing modes, called attention to a similar semantic device by which the difference between cause and effect could be united in purely verbal fashion with their basic identity: But if the maxim holds firm that quidquid est in effectu d?bet esse prius aliquo modo in causa, it follows that the next moment can contain nothing genuinely original, and that the novelty that appears to leak into our lives so unremittingly, must be an illusion, ascribable to the shallowness of the perceptual point of view. Scholasticism always respected the common sense, and in this case escaped the frank denial of all genuine novelty by the vague qualification "aliquo modo." This allowed the effect also to differ, "?liquo modo,** from its cause. But conceptual necessities have ruled the situation and have ended, as usual, by driving nature and perception to the wall. A cause and its effect are two numerically different concepts, and yet in some inscrutable way the former must "produce" the latter. How can it intelligibly do so, save by already hiding the latter in itself ? 44 More interesting is the attempt of the other group of determinists who, not satisfied by simple empirical (as they believe) coexistence of causal necessity and succession, are trying earnestly to explain it. The case of the once famous French philosopher and psychologist Alfred Fouill? is repre sentative and instructive in this respect. He says explicitly: We live in time and we reason in time. Well, in time it would be contradictory to say that the future exists and exerts influence because in such a case I would be at the same time alive and dead, truly alive and truly dead, my future death being already real as much as my present life. Such a theory would mean the elimination of every possible thought and every possible experience because 44 W. James, Some Problems of Philosophy, pp. 192-93.</page><page sequence="28">38 Mille Capek thought cannot admit the simultaneous presence of contradictories and because experience cannot grasp simultaneously the present and the future.45 This argument is very probably borrowed from Boutroux, for whom it was equivalent to the rejection of necessitarianism; but not so for Fouill? who on the same page did not forget to add that contingency is absent from the past, from the present as well as from the future. According to Fouill?, we have to replace static determinism by what he calls "le d?terminisme dynami que"; what is original in Fouill?'s position is that temporality is not only recognized as genuinely real, but also attempted to be logically explained as an unavoidable result of the law of non-contradiction. For it is the logical incompatibility of the successive phases of the universe which prevents them from being all co-present simultaneously in one single "punctum stans." The argument is extremely interesting and, if valid, it would provide the answer to the question raised by Lequier, Delb uf, James and Boutroux. Why is the already developed film of reality only gradually unrolled instead of being spread out at once like a map ? The same argument in its less precise form occurs very frequently, especially in preponderantly determinis tic historical reasoning. Was the French revolution possible, say, for instance, after the death of Louis XV in 1715 ? The answer which we would hear, would be: "Certainly not, because not all necessary conditions were present." But although it was impossible in 1715, was it not necessary already then as a future 45 A. Fouill?, La pens?e et les nouvelles ?coles antiintellectualistes, p. 140. In this book, though published in 1911, the author merely restates the ideas contained in the series of articles published in the Revue Philosophique in 1882-1883, directed mainly against Lequier, Renouvier, Delbceuf and Boutroux: "Les nouveaux exp?dients en faveur du libre arbitre," "Les arguments m?taphysiques en faveur du libre arbitre," "Le libre arbitre et la contingence des futurs," and "Causalit? et libert?." It is significant that Fouill? does not realize that in comparing causality to mathematical implication he destroys his own explanation why the future is not yet present: "Quand deux et trois sont pr?sent, cinq ne peut ?tre ni absent, ni en retard; il n'a pas ? choisir son heure; il est lui, aussi, imm?diatement pr?sent" (R. Ph., 1882, II, p. 607).</page><page sequence="29">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 39 event in 1789 ? Let us go further: Was the revolution possible in 1788? For an unprejudiced historian it was. At the time, the revolutionary propaganda already had very considerable psychological effects, the authority of the aristocracy, hierarchy and dynasty was seriously undermined, the sight of the nobility riding in carriages already drew threatening gestures from the people while Marat was reciting Rousseau's Contrat Social publicly on the boulevards of Paris. Yet, for a rigid determinist the outbreak of the revolution was still impossible in 1788 for the simple reason that it did not occur. To him, to speak about the possibility of the revolution in 1788 is nothing but vague and metaphorical language because no real possibilities exist; what ever does not happen is impossible and the term "possibility" itself is nothing but what was called by Spinoza "asylum ignorantiae." We can apply the same reasoning to the history of any individual person; for instance, the murder committed by Raskolnikov was impossible up to the last moment; as matter of fact, it was even impossible in the last second when he was already raising the hatchet with his hands half-paralyzed by the strong unconscious resistance to the coming crime. This impossibility is similar to that which prevents a bullet from hitting its target when it is still separated from it by the distance of few feet, or which prevents the Earth from being at the perihelion while it is still 30 km. away from it. More generally, it is the same impossibility which prevents the successive stages of one process from being simultaneously present. But if it is so, would it not be logical to follow this reasoning up to the end and to say with the author of Time and Free-Will that the event is necessary when it is actually present and that the whole thesis of "dynamic determinism" can be reduced to a simple truism that "what is done, is done" ? 46 For, no matter how narrow the time-interval separating two successive events becomes, their incompatibility is the very opposite of the iron 46 Essai sur les donn?es imm?diates de la conscience, p. 137: "vous verrez que l'argumentation des d?terministes rev?t cette forme pu?rile: "L'acte une fois accompli, est accompli et que leurs adversaires r?pondent: l'acte, avant d'?tre accompli, ne l'?tait pas encore."

Thus while static determinism abolished real causation by dissolving it into timeless eternal implication, "dynamic determinism" breaks the continuity of temporal causal action into the multiplicity of vanishing and disconnected instants without any bridge which would convey the postulated neces sitating pressure by which one event "brings into being" the subsequent one. Both forms of determinism are complementary outgrowths of the same basic fallacy ? the fallacy of confusing causality with static relation. The first ends in the static eternal unity of the Spinozean and Laplacean "block-universe," the second in the discontinuity of the no less static instants of the logical atomism of Russell with its lurking Humean implica tions.47 IV In removing contradictory and contra-empirical Eleatic habits of our thought, are we not approaching the true notion of causality conceived as a successive process and not as a logical implication ? Before we shall discuss it, it is important to point out that the only merit of Fo?ill?'s method ? the attempt to justify logically the fact of temporality in the neces sitarian scheme ? failed to convince the majority of scientists who otherwise agreed with him in rejecting the reality of con tingency. This became especially obvious when the great number of physicists took the first opportunity to accept the most extreme Eleatic conclusions about reality. Such an opportunity 47 The Principles of Mathematics, 1903, p. 347: "Weierstrass, by strictly banishing all infinitesimals, has at last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow, at every moment of its flight is strictly at rest. The only point where Zeno probably erred was in inferring (if he did infer) that, because there is no change, therefore the world must be in the same state at one time as at another" (Italics mine). In spite of this Humean assertion of the sheer externality of the subsequent events, Russell still maintained their causal implication (pp. 474-81) and obviously adhered to the classical Laplacean view. Only considerably later he realized the Humean implications of his views when he declared the law of causality to be "a relic of a by-gone age" (Mysticism and Logic, p. 180).</page><page sequence="31">The Doctrine of Necessity Re~Examined 41 presented itself in 1908 when Minkowski in interpreting Lorentz's equations proposed to merge space and time into one single quadridimensional continuum called "space-time." Minkowski himself and a great number of physicists and philosophers considered this fusion of space and time as a sort of spatialization of time, time being conceived as an additional fourth dimension of space. According to Einstein himself, "becoming" in three dimensional space was thus transformed into being in the world of four dimensions; according to Cun ningham "the history of a system is unfolded into an entity deprived of change. But the limitations of the human intellect separate the changeless whole into its spatial and temporal aspects, the past and the future of the physical world being only the past and the future of the intellect which perceives it." 4* Hermann Weyl did not hesitate to affirm that "the objective world simply is, it does not become"; it appears to become only to our "blind-folded consciousness" (abgeblendete Bewusst sein).49 Such views were representative of the large group of scientists. Could the Laplacean ideal of the elimination of time have been realized more completely and more accurately ? At the same time it becomes obvious that Fo?ill?'s attempt to derive temporality from the incompatibility of successive phases either fails or is circular. From the mere incompatibility of events their succession cannot be derived, as Minkowski's scheme plainly shows; using Fo?ill?'s example, two "successive" events of my life literally coexist on the world-line in the continuum of four dimensions, being separated by what we call "the length of time"; the law of contradiction is not violated because the propositions "I am alive" and "I am dead" refer to two different points on the same world-line without making them successive in a truly objective sense. This conclusion is nothing but a recognition of the fact that succession is something more than a simple diversity or multiplicity. If, on the other hand, Fouill? 48 Quoted by E. Meyerson, La d?duction relativiste, Paris, 1925, p. 100. 4?H. Weyl, Was ist Materie?

It is not difficult to see that this last attempt to eliminate time and succession fails in its ultimate purpose as much as all previous ones. Even if we consider it as the indisputably correct interpretation of the special theory of relativity and even if we admit with Cassirer that in the physical world the distinction between the past and the future is as arbitrary as the distinction between positive and negative direction of a straight line in space,50 the fact of succession remains unchallenged in its last refuge: consciousness itself. Even Weyl had to admit that our "blindfolded" consciousness creeps along the world-line of its own body into the area of the universe which is called "future"; 51 or, in the language of Eddington, we meet the future events already existing in our way to the future?2 It is evident that although Minkowski's schema eliminates succession in the physical world, it recognizes at least the movement of our consciousness into the future. Without it not even an illusion of change could arise; it is the same "paradox of the changing Eleatic" to which we referred above. But in the case of the special theory of relativity it is not necessary to resort to the ultimate epistemological argument in order to save the reality of change and succession. It becomes more and more obvious that the true interpretation of the Lorentz transformation is exactly contrary to that quoted above. We do not have to forget that the negative result of the Michelson experiments established the impossibility of deter mining the absolute movement of the Earth, that is, the impos sibility of determining the absolute frame of reference to which this movement could be referred.

The generalization by Einstein of the negative result of Michelson's experiments logically implied then the rejection of absolute space. Absolute space in classical mechanics was conceived as an instantanous three-dimensional cross-section of the spatio-temporal development of the universe, a cross-section in which all truly simultaneous events were located; thus the rejection of absolute space implied the rejection of the objective substratum of absolute simultaneity and, consequently, the elimination of the absolute simultaneity of distant events which was silently assumed in Newtonian mechanics; that is why it was possible to speak about "nature at a given instant" or, with Laplace, about the "instantaneous state of the world'" represented by a giant configuration of simultaneous corpus cular entities. The special theory of relativity thus implies the impossibility of isolating the instantaneous three-dimensional cross-section called "absolute space" from the quadridimensionai development of physical reality: it was this instantaneous slice in which all truly simultaneous events were supposedly located. This is the meaning of Whitehead's statement that "there is no such thing as nature at an instant" 53 or of Eddington's claim that there is "no world-wide instant," i.e., an instant covering the whole universe.54 But does it not thus become clear that Minkowski's fusion of time and space into a single dynamic whole across which all instantaneous cuts are artificial can be better characterized as a dynamisation or temporalization of space rather than a spatialization of time ? The probability of this conclusion is strengthened by the epistemological analysis of our habit of conceiving time as a simple additional dimension of space. This "spatialization of 53 A. N.

For it is foresight which enables an individual organ ism to adjust itself to new situations. This psychological tend ency took a more distinct and a more elaborate form after the foundation of rational mechanics when time acquired the func tion of an independent variable; but, as Bergson, Meyerson and C. D. Broad pointed out, in a space-time diagram of mechanics, just because it is a geometrical diagram containing simultaneous parts, we have a tendency to be more interested in the time-axis already drawn than in the point-like present sliding along it; the positions which punctual presentness oc cupies successively already exist in the diagram.55 It is not surprising that Descartes considered time as a dimension and that d'Alembert defined mechanics as "la g?om?trie ? quatre dimensions." The foundations of the Laplacean illusion were thus laid down and it is only natural that the habit of spatializa tion of time, strengthened by three centuries of successful appli cation in physics, naturally and spontaneously slipped into the interpretations of the special theory of relativity, especially since the Kantian doctrine of the ideality of time oriented the imagina tion of philosophers in the same direction. Nevertheless, there have always been a number of physicists and philosophers who insisted that the true meaning of Minkowski's schema is incom patible with spatialization, i.e., elimination of time. Among the physicists, Langevin and, in his latter phase, Eddington,56 pointed out that the dissymmetry of time and space is preserved even in the special theory of relativity and that it is precisely the finite velocity of light which prevents indiscriminate inter 55 H.

Among phi losophers, Bergson, Meyerson, Whitehead and Paul Weiss 57 insisted on the fundamental irreversibility of time even in the relativistic scheme of the universe and on its compatibility with the plurality of individual temporal perspectives. There is no space left here to point out how this dynamic interpretation of Einsteinean "space-time" ? or rather "time space" ? is supported by other facts of contemporary physics. A detailed discussion of the implications of the quantum theory and of the problems connected with the much disputed Heisen berg principle of indeterminacy would require a separate article, For our present purpose it is sufficient to state that any return to classical determinism appears to be extremely doubtful. There is one relatively simple reason; underlying the classical, i.e., necessitarian, concept of causality is the claim that the history of the physical universe can be represented as a mathe matically continuous series of instantaneous states, each being an instantaneous configuration of a fantastically large number of simultaneous corpuscular entities sharply defined by their positions, velocities and accelerations. It is thus evident that the classical concept of causality presupposes the whole set of classical ideas: a) spatio-temporal continuity;58 b) absolute 57 H. Bergson, op. cit., pp. 98-99, 111-15; E. Meyerson, op.cit., the chapter "Le temps"; A. N. Whitehead, An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, p. 81; The Concept of Nature, p. 178; Paul Weiss, "The Nature and Status of Time and Passage," (Philosophical Essays for A. N. Whitehead, p. 162). 58 C. S. Peirce in an article written sixty years ago observed that "the essence of the necessitarian position is that certain continuous quantities have certain exact values," in other words, that the concept of spatio temporal continuity, implying the possibility of precise punctual localiza tion, underlies the classical idea of causality. In showing its basic un verifiability, Peirce virtually anticipated Heisenberg 's principle of indeter minacy and the pulsational character of all changes as it is suggested by modern quantum theory. ("Doctrine of Necessity Examined," Collected Papers of C. S. Peirce, edited by C. Hartshorne and P. Weiss, VI, p. 35.) Although the pulsational theory of change was anticipated by Renou vier, Bergson and James, who all applied the notion of "specious present" even to the physical world, it descended to a more empirical ground with</page><page sequence="36">46 Mille Capek simultaneity of even the most distant events; c) corpuscles with their positions and velocities sharply definable. Not a single one of these concepts remained unchallenged by the present transformation in physics. All hopes that the indeterminacy of microphysical events can be reduced eventually to the causal models of classical physics spring obviously from the phil osophical belief that the Newton-Laplacean necessity is the only type of rational coherence. No matter what different forms this belief takes, whether it is stated in terms of the Kantian or Neo-Kantian philosophy or in the cruder form of mechanistic naturalism, the same conclusion is implicitly present: that the modes of thought formed in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and characterized by the names of Des cartes, Spinoza, Newton and Laplace are even today adequate instruments for interpreting the nature of physical reality ? and even the nature of reality in general. From this point of view the differences between naturalism and idealism appear less important; Kantianism, for instance, is nothing but a deter minism of Newtonian time enclosed within the limits of the "phenomenal world," and the only "freedom" which is thus secured is the ghostly freedom of the "intelligible character" which, in being "postulated," is not only unverifiable, but by its timeless character even incompatible with the openness to the future without which it is nothing but an empty word. It is also the advent of quantum theory. It can be hardly denied that the structure of microphysical events is hardly compatible with the concept of mathematically continuous time, and those who rejected the existence of the point-like instants and accepted "the quantum of time" (A. N. White head) or "the unit of motion and change" (Paul Weiss) are on incomparably safer ground than their opponents. (Whitehead, The Concept of Nature. p. 162; Paul Weiss, Reality, Book II, ch. 7.) The article of Adolf Gr?nbaum, "Relativity and the Atomicity of Becoming" (The Review of Metaphysics, IV, pp. 143-86) would certainly require a detailed and care ful analysis; it is, however, significant that in defending the mathematical continuity of time he fails to mention the quantum theory even by a single word and that he does not emphasize the macroscopic character of the theory of relativity. In the theory of relativity we deal with the physical events on the macroscopic level and this accounts for the fact that relativistic space-time can be considered as practically continuous.</page><page sequence="37">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 47 worth noting that the tendency toward timeless idealism, the sympathy for the concept of mechanical causality, and the attempt to represent the universe as a changeless geometrical pattern ? in which time would be nothing but a "world-line" without any intrinsic dissymetry and possibly even returning to itself in a closed curve as in the mechanical universe of Nietzsche ? are associated in the minds of some physicists even today.59 But is causal necessity really the only type of rational coherence ? Precisely the opposite is true; only when causal connection is not conceived as a deductive implication, can it retain its dynamic successive character which appears as a foreign and unaccountable element in the necessitarian scheme. But this implies that the possibility of the future, instead of being a simple label for our ignorance, is real in a certain sense; in 59 Kurt G?del's essay "A Remark about the Relationship between Relativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy and Einstein's comment about it (in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, Library of Living Philosophers, edited by P. A. Schilpp, 1949) furnish a striking illustration of these tendencies. G?del attempts to obtain "an unequivocal proof for the view of those philosophers who, like Parmenides, Kant and modern idealists, deny the objectivity of change and consider change as an illusion or appearance due to our special mode of perception." He also quotes McTaggart's article in Mind, 1908, "The Unreality of Time," in support of his view of the contradictory character of change (p. 557). It is hardly surprising then that the author considers the possibility of a round trip on a rocket ship in Wellsian fashion "into any region of the past, present and future and back again" and he even computes the fuel and velocity required for such travelling (pp. 560-61). The author obviously does not realize that his own language betrays him when he speaks about the possibility of "finding himself in the earlier period of his life" and doing something to this past person "which, by his memory, he knows has not happened to him"; does not it mean that it would not be a complete return into the past because the distinction between the "past" person and the "returning observer" would be maintained and therefore succession even in such a fantastic case is not entirely eliminated ? It is even more significant that Einstein's comment about this essay is quite sympathetic (pp. 687-88), and that his main doubt about the objectivity, i.e., assymmetry of time is based on his belief, undoubtedly true in the classical corpuscular-kinetic picture, that "all elementary processes are reversible.'*</page><page sequence="38">48 Mille Capek other words, that the future is only probably implied by the present, instead of being mathematically performed in all its individual details. The most popular argument of the nineteenth century determinists was that the affirmation of real contin gency, no matter how small in nature, is equivalent to the recognition of a miraculous "creatio ex nihilo." It is true that the expression of Renouvier, "the absolute beginning" (le com mencement absolu), easily suggested this misinterpretation; but it is also true that Renouvier himself, pressed in discussion by Fouill?, restated his thought in a clearer and less misleading way in insisting that his concept of "absolute beginning" is incompatible only with causality of the "causa aequat effectum" type, while it is not only consistent with, but even requires the more general type of causal connection.60 But necessitarians, being aware that caricatures of their opponents are more vulner able than the opponents themselves, picture a modern temporalist form of indeterminism as a simple re-edition of the absolute indeterminism of the medieval "liberum arbitrium" characterized by the story of Buridan's ass. William James, as early as 1890, unmasked "the ejaculation of Mr. Spencer" and the caricature of indeterminism by John Fiske, both claiming that the denial of necessity is equivalent to the affirmation of lawlessness in nature, which thus makes impossible all ethics, history, politics and laws. A specimen of Fiske's reasoning is given by James and is worth quoting again: If the volitions arise without cause, it necessarily follows that we cannot infer from them the character of the antecedent states of feeling. If, therefore, a murder has been committed, we have a priori no better reason for suspecting the worst enemy than the best friend of the murdered man... (Principles of Psychology, II, p. 577).?i 60 Renouvier answered Fo?ill?'s article "Les nouveaux exp?dients en faveur du libre arbitre" (Revue philosophique, 1882, II, pp. 585ff.) in Critique philosophique, 1883, II, pp. 49 ff. ("Les arguments psychologiques pour et contre le libre arbitre") where he modified his idea of "absolute beginning." 61 The objections of Ernst Cassirer are directed against the same "unlimited indeterminism" (schrankenlos Indeterminismus) as those of Fiske and Spencer. (Determinismus und Indeterminismus in der modernen Physik, pp. 246-54).</page><page sequence="39">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 49 It is evident that similar arguments are directed against absolute indeterminism which is not defended by anybody with the possible exception of Dirac, advocating "liberum arbitrium naturae." One year before the publication of James's Principles Bergson had already pointed out that the real novelty of the present moment must not be conceived as "creatio ex nihilo";62 on the contrary, the emergence of novelty is nothing but a real continuity between the past and the present. This continuity is of a dynamic, successive type, or, speaking with Whitehead, a "becoming of continuity" instead of a rigid timeless implic ation of the Laplacean type. In the temporal continuity of a real process of causation ? which should be distinguished from the spurious mathematical "continuity" of durationless instants ?* the causal or "mnemic" influence of the past is not denied; but the present, though co-determined by the past, nevertheless contains an element of irreducible novelty. The individuality of a present event, or, better, its presentness would be irre mediably destroyed without this double feature of novelty and its dynamic cohesion with the anterior phases. Still, it is the connection with, as well as the contrast to, the past which creates the specific presentness of "now." As far as the future is concerned, it is the future and not a disguised or a hidden present as in the necessitarian scheme; it will arise, it is not present. But because it will not emerge "ex nihilo," but out of a particular present state, its general direction is outlined and thus it possesses some predictable features, the more predictable, the larger the statistical complexes of the elementary events considered. Hence arises the possibility of practically accurate predictions of macroscopic events. The example mentioned by Ralph B. Perry belongs to this category; the predictability of any observable ? and therefore macroscopic ? particle is, as Louis de Broglie pointed out, only approximate and does not alter the basic contingencies of the elementary microphysical events of which a particle consists. The predicted path of a particle which appears in our macroscopic perspective as a sharp and precise line, will be really a tube, although a very tenuous *2 Essai, pp. 125-26; Mati?re et m?moire, p. 204.</page><page sequence="40">50 Milic Capek one, its transversal dimensions corresponding to the quantic indeterminacies of its positions.63 Even here, the anticipated "path of the future" consists really of the whole range of multiple possibilities which only in our dim, inaccurate and simplifying macroscopic perspective shrink to what we consider an infinitely thin line of "the only possible way." Thus the last psychological obstacle to the recognition of the inseparability of time and con tingency is removed. This obstacle was our belief that the concept of "the only possible future" in spite of its intrinsic logical difficulties is at least empirically justified. Obviously, this belief, which is still shared by many philosophers, is nothing but an intellectual habit derived from limited and insuf ficiently analyzed experience. Apparently, when Emile Boutroux in 1874 claimed that his "elementary variations" (les variations ?l?mentaires) are so small that they escape experimental detection by the inac curate instruments of that period, he hardly expected that within half a century the refinements of methods of observa tion would confirm his bold anticipations. Today, science is not ruined and "Reason" is not committing suicide, although the classical concept of causality is being given up, or, more accurately, being replaced by a redefined concept purged of the inconsistencies and absurdities of the old one. Tempo ralistic as well as modern philosophy of science returns only by devious and complicated ways to the evidence of our immediate experience ^? to one of a few evidences which are not deceptive: to that of a really growing world with genuine novelties emerging from past antecedents. Other deceptive features of our macroscopic experience together with the fixed Eleatic habits of our thought have for a long time obscured this evidence. In such a growing world every present event is undoubtedly caused, though not necessitated, by its own past. For, as long as it is not yet present, its specific character remains uncertain for one simple reason: that it is only its presentness which creates its specificity, i.e., brings an end to 63 L. de Broglie, "LEspace et le temps dans la physique quantique," Revue de M?taphysique et de Morale, 54 ann?e, 1949, pp. 119-20.</page><page sequence="41">The Doctrine of Necessity Re-Examined 51 its uncertainty by eliminating all other possible features in compatible with it.64 Thus every present event is by its own essence an act of selection ending the hesitation of reality between various possibilities.65 The terms "selection" and "hesitation" appear to be metaphorical and even anthropomor phic at first glance; in truth they express nothing but the ambiguous character of the unrealized future as well as its subsequent concrete realization. They describe complementary aspects of every temporal process: its indeterminacy and its creative character. Does causality thus re-defined affect in any significant way the traditional problem of freedom ? On this point opin ions differ. Peirce's view was very definite: On the other hand, by supposing the rigid exactitude of causation to yield, I care not how little ? be it by a strictly infinitesimal amount *-* we gain room to insert mind into our scheme, and to put it into the place where it is needed, into the position which, as the sole self-intelligible thing, it is entitled to occupy, that of the fountain of existence; and in doing so we resolve the problem of the connection of soul and body.66 Against this view it is generally objected that on the macro physical level the uncertainty of the future events practically disappears and, because even the smallest organisms are macro physical systems, strict determinism on the biological level can and has to be maintained.67 This conclusion, plausible as it appears, overlooks several important facts. First, the micro physical zone is not an isolated compartment of nature, since it is connected by innumerable causal links with the rest of the universe, including "the world of middle dimensions" to which animal bodies belong. Again, it was Boutroux who 64 "Whatever is realized in any one occasion of experience neces sarily excluded the unbounded welter of contrary possibilities. There are always 'others,' which might have been and are not." A. N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, p.356 (Italics mine). 65 H. Bergson, La Pens?e et le Mouvant, p. 117: "Le temps est cette h?sitation m?me, ou il n'est rien du tout." 66 C. S. Peirce, loc.cit, pp. 42-43. 67 For instance Erwin B?nning in his article "Sind die Organismen die mikrophysikalische Systeme?" (Erkenntnis, V, pp. 337-48).</page><page sequence="42">52 Milic Capek pointed out that microphysical contingencies in spite of their minuteness may bring about considerable results by purely mechanical contre-coups.68 All breaks of equilibrium, all sorts of trigger-action consist of a sudden discharge of previously accumulated energy by a quantitatively insignificant agency. It is also unquestionable that the organic processes which are of the most vital importance occur on a scale not too remote from the dimensions of the microphysical world: for example the changes inside of the nuclei of cells. Are the organisms "multiplicators of atomic ind?terminations," 69 i.e., systems of established arrangements by which microphysical contingencies are transmitted and increased up to the degree which makes them macroscopically efficient ? On the higher animal level such established arrangements are, represented by the neural mechanisms lodged in the cerebro-spinal system which can be set into operation by a very small signal impulse of the cortex. But no matter how small, this impulse is a physical event and, according to classical physics, strictly predetermined by its causal antecedents. When William James suggested that this central activating impulse has its source in the activity of consciousness 70 it was possible to refute him in the name of classical determinism which confined consciousness within the limbo of causal inefficacy. James himself was well aware of this difficulty, which stemmed from the fact that the only solu tion of the traditional mind-body problem compatible with classical physics was the theory of psycho-physical parallelism, according to which consciousness is only an inert epiphenome non passively accompanying cerebral processes. To claim that the intellectual situation is the same today is to be completely 68 De la contingence des lois de la nature, pp. 60-61. 69 The term used by physicist Pascual Jordan in his articles: "Quantenmechanik und Grund-probleme der Biologie und Psychologie" (Naturwissenschaften, XX, Heft 45, pp. 815-21); "Quantenphysikalische Bemerkungen zur Biologie und Psychologie," (Erkenntnis, IV, pp. 215 ff); "Die Verst?rckettheorie der Organismen," (Naturwiss., 1938, Heft 33.) 70 In the article "Are we Automata?"

It is certainly significant that James' theory in its most important features reappears today in the following affirmation by Ralph S. Lillie: There would seem to be no escape from the ascription of a certain variable element of spontaneity, non-conformity to rule, or creativity to natural processes in general. This condition reaches a maximum in the more complex types of biological causation such as human activity, although it is there limited in its possibilities by physical and physiological constants already established, as well as by social and other environmental conditions.71 Similar, though not identical views were expressed by Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, Pascual Jordan and others.72 There is no space left here for the detailed discussion of these views. Obviously, if a microphysical ind?termination, occurring in the critical area of the organism, is an outer aspect of the spontaneity of consciousness or of the organizing vital activity, the tradi tional Cartesian distinction between consciousness and matter has to be profoundly modified. The revision of this distinction is an essential part of nearly every temporalistic philosophy. It is virtually implied in the affirmation of creativity even on the physical level. No matter what the final destiny of the particular views of Lillie, Weyl, Eddington and Jordan may be, two facts remain certain. First, any return to the Laplacean and Spin ozistic modes of thought in physics appears to be extremely improbable. Second, it is only natural to expect that the impact of the new forms of thought created by modern physics and anticipated by the French and American temporalists will be felt sooner or later in all other areas of human knowledge. In the same way the influence of seventeenth century physics gradually penetrated biology, psychology and even history and 71 In the article "Biological Causation" in Philosophy of Science, July 1940, p. 336. 72 H.

Jordan (see note 69).</page><page sequence="44">54 Mille Capek laid down the foundations for the parallelistic and epiphenom enalistic solutions of the mind-body problem. Is it then sur prising that the recent attempts of reformulation and new solu tion of the same problem distinctly depart from parallelistic epiphenomenalism ? With the premises changed, the conclu sions must be different too. Today, as in the seventeenth century, physics leads the revolutionary onslaught on the traditional forms of thought. It is only realistic to expect that for some time the old intellectual habits will dominate large areas of knowledge outside of physics. This is especially true of psychology and social sciences where mechanistic determinism, though no more universally recognized, is still well entrenched. However, if intellectual development follows its normal course, the cultural lag between physics and other sciences will gradually disappear. It is possible that in the future the magnificent, though profoundly depressing vision of Anatole France, to which we referred in the first part of this article and according to which all particular events pre-exist in the network of lifeless eternity, will appear as strange as its extreme antithesis ? the medieval story of Buridan's ass immobilized and dying because of its absolute freedom.
