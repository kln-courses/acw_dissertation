<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERPRETING "WESTERN WIND" BY CHARLES FREY A Tudor manuscript, a part-book probably owned by a musician in the court of Henry VIII, provides the first written appearance of the well-known anonymous lyric, "Western Wind," and is the ulti- mate source for printed versions.' Its text (see the Facsimile) may be transcribed as follows: Westron wynde when wyll thow blow the smalle rayne downe can Rayne Cryst yf my love were in my Armys And I yn my bed Agayne.2 Reasonably accurate versions were printed as early as 1790, but distorted versions also gained acceptance. William Chappell, in 1859, radically altered the text: Westron wynde"when wyll thou blow? The smalle rain down 'doth' rayne; 'Oh!' if my love were in my armys, 'Or' I in my bed a-gayne.3 During the following hundred years, several careful transcriptions were printed, and they were available to the many editors who produced instead a "modern" version: 0 Western wind, when wilt thou blow That the small rain down can rain? Christ, that my love were in my arms, And I in my bed again!4 These Victorian and modern versions serve interesting, if ques- tionable, aims, and they point to important issues in the interpreta- Charles Frey 259 ELH 43 259-278 (1976) Copyright ? 1976 by The Johns Hopkins University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. British Museum, Royal Appendix MS. 58, fol. 5 tion of "Western Wind." " 'Or' I in my bed a-gayne" is bowdlerizing of the highest caliber: we may imagine the lovers embracing or the speaker in bed but not the lovers in bed. Emending "Cryst" to "Oh" was thought, perhaps, to make the poem safe for women and children. The more recent redactors appear at first to pursue more worthy goals, for modernized spelling renders the poem more ac- cessible, and the interpolation "That the small rain down can rain" merely makes clear, it could be argued, what otherwise might re- main murky-the rain is welcomed. (Chappell, however, believed the opposite-the wind was to blow away the rain-and so altered "cans," a crux, to "doth" and inserted his question mark after the first line.) One might think that insertion of "0" at the beginning and substitution of archaic "wilt" for "will" both work against the mod- ernizing, simplifying tendency, but actually such changes help to place the poem as a standard romantic cry and so aid in a drive toward cognitive clarity. Yet the attempt, through such alteration and addition, to accommodate the text to contemporary taste or understanding makes no more sense than an attempt to accommodate Michelangelo's David to our taste or understanding by rechiseling the expression on its face. It is my argument not only that "Western Wind" is suffering at the hands of many editors (as well as critics with axes to grind and textbook writers who use it to illustrate themes) but also that the song reveals fresh meaning and savor if studied in its first form and context. 260 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="3">I The editorial problem extends beyond naive or knowing mis- transcription; conflicting interpretations of the first two lines have produced two schools of punctuation and annotation: Westron wynde, Western wind, when wyll thow blow? when will thou blow, The small rayne downe can rayne. The small rain down can rain? Cryst, yf my loue wer in my armys, Christ, if my love were in my arms And I yn my bed Agayne. And I in my bed again! Those transposed question marks may seem a minor matter, but they are usually meant to determine whether the rain should go away or stay. Editors who favor the first version say that "can" means "does" or "did" and "small" means "thin, biting."5 Editors who favor the second version think that "can" means "may" and "small" means "fine" or "gentle."6 The first version then means: "Western wind, when will thou blow? The small rain down does (or did, or has begun to) rain. (Please blow it away!)" The second version means: "Western wind, when will thou blow so that the small rain down can rain?" The majority of critics favor the latter reading, and there are several reasons to do so. Parallelisms among all four lines of syntactic structure and musical phrasing suggest a like pattern of expectation in each of the first two lines as well as the other lines. "Can," suggesting welcomed possibility, follows naturally upon "when will" in the first line.7 "Small rain," a phrase as old as the time of King Alfred, seems most often to have been regarded not only as fine and gentle but also as calming and benefi- cent: "Small rain lays great dust" (OED, "rain," sb., 1. b); "A small rayne abatyth a grete wynd" (1533: OED, "rain," sb., 3. a.). Even the west wind has been termed "small" (OED, "small," A. adi., 14.). The total image can easily suggest wind leading into rain. And, finally, if the western wind may be identified with Zephyrus, then Chaucer's collocation of that wind's sweet breath and spring show- ers bathing "every veyn" comes naturally to mind. True, Zephyrus (or Favonius) is generally regarded as a fair-weather breeze.8 Even as such, however, it might be imagined assisting the down- dropping dew or driving in the rain toward hidden seeds.9 Her- rick's "To the Western Wind" portrays the western wind as sweet yet showery: Charles Frey 261</page><page sequence="4">Sweet western wind, whose luck it is, Made rival with the air, To give Perenna's lip a kiss, And fan her wanton hair, Bring me but one, I'll promise thee, Instead of common showers, Thy wings shall be embalmed by me And all beset with flowers. Wind and rain may thus blend beneficently. The overall tone of the song, however, is hardly buoyant. Its music suits a serious, if not sad, theme, and the nostalgic ending presents an almost-despairing emphasis upon gaps between past comfort and present pain. The western wind, in fact, need not be gentle Zephyrus; the context of desolate lovers suggests something much more bleak, as in the Scots song, "Waly Waly, Love Be Bonny": Marti'mas wind, when wilt thou blaw, And shake the green leaves aff the tree? o gentle death, whan wilt thou cum? For of my life I am wearie.10 In a poem out of the later middle ages alluding to Christ, the west wind cannot be blithely dissociated from death's famous quadrant. By the same token, the small rain need not suggest seminal dew; tears of sorrow and loss may be more appropriate: The wind doth blow today, my love, And a few small drops of rain; I never bad but one true-love, In cold grave she was lain.'1 The song might be no species of reverdie but might approximate the meaning: "Western wind of death, when will thou blow and accompany the rain that grieves for my lost lover?" We may then find foreshadowed Shelley's dark autumnal wind, "destroyer and preserver," whose power confounds, as well as anticipates, its "az- ure sister of the Spring."'12 II As the editorial kaleidoscope turns, shifts in meaning of a word seem to cause the collapse of a wider pattern and the rearrangement of its parts into a wholly new design. We could attribute this phenomenon to the dense concentration of meanings in lyrics of brief compass. Or, conversely, we could argue that such lyrics are, 262 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="5">of necessity, inspecific, that they are open and defenseless against variant readings, habitually exhibiting the ambiguity of underde- termined meanings. But is either tack truly responsive to "Western Wind'? Would the change from "can" as 'may'' to "can" as "does" greatly change the poem? I think not, because, whether the rain is welcomed or not, the wind is invoked for the sake of change to a better climate. It is the wind that brings or banishes the rain. To contemplate the coming of the rain is to admit its unwanted ab- sence; to imagine its surcease is to admit its unwanted presence. In all cases the rain is present in mind. The rain forever comes or goes, and, whichever state we seek, impermanence is the one constant. Taken as a whole, the song stirs both memory and desire, an aware- ness of love gained and gone. We cannot say that the speaker only hopes or only despairs. The poem's "yf' is both promising and forlorn, just as "Cryst" connotes both death and life. There is a vast difference, admittedly, between a warm, germinal, spring rain that is longed for and a cold winter rain that is shunned, but, under either hypothesis, the wind is harbinger of desired change, bringer of new and needed weather, and so an intermediary between ten- sionally charged states of mind which are simultaneously con- templated. If I am right that the song stands at the intersection of pleasure and pain, that to hear or say it is to experience the incalculable duality of desire, then it follows that attempts to solve or under- stand the experience will fail to the degree that the proposed solu- tion or understanding reduces the tension of such experience. At- tempts, for example, to overspecify the narrative context and to posit "my love" as either dead or alive, or as either husband or wife or sweetheart, all amount to teasing ways of plucking the heart from the mystery. The speaker's wife is dead; he appropriately invokes "Cryst." The speaker's sweetheart is alive, a sailor or farmer far from their illicit bed: "Cryst" is thus a most impious profanity.'3 Totally eclipsed, indeed denied, are ways in which the song in its musical context, without raising or answering such questions of specificity, might remain a self-sufficient expression of connections between nature's cyclical renewals (the first two lines) and our own linear losses (the last two lines). The wind "wyll" blow; "my love" may not return. A poem of "yf' leads through the inseparable dis- tress and sweetness of hope and remembrance. Overspecifications of analysis creep in even when critics seek meanings of the whole. Remarks intended to be generalizing often Charles Frey 263</page><page sequence="6">focus upon limited facets, and discussions of whole-poem features such as structure and tone often bring into prominence single de- vices or spread the poem out into non-cumulative bits.14 Typically, such interpretive excesses accompany attempts to use "Western Wind" to make a point about pure and impure poetry, tone, struc- ture, the place of the speaker, symbolism, countermotion, intensity, economy, or indirection. In other words, the poem is examined not for itself but for what it can be made to contribute to an argument in a textbook on poetry or essay on style, and, inevitably, the process becomes one not of understanding but of undercutting the poem's full dimensions. In the drive to make their point, critics tend most often to use assumptions about "Western Wind" that are both unsupported and dubious. A critic will call it a woman's complaint or folk ballad or popular song or say that the wind is "moist" or that the wind con- notes "mystery and hope" and the rain connotes the "joy and peace of lovers' tears" or that the rain is sought for "crops."'15 For some interpretive purposes, of course, a few assumptions may be nearly impossible to avoid, such as that the text is established or that the western wind blows in the northern hemisphere. But we need al- ways to ask whether the assumptions made are necessary to the argument and, if so, what evidence can be adduced to support them. "Western Wind" is, no doubt, unusually difficult to place. On the one hand, assumptions concerning the reality represented by the poem, its mimetic context, often prove insupportable or unhelpful. Thus meteorological assumptions, as we have seen, fail to eliminate the crux at "can." On the other hand, proposed analogies, such as other poems of wind, rain, and loneliness-assumptions as to literary context-reveal a wider, not narrower, range of possible meanings. Even attempts to support assumptions about the historical context produce questionable results. It is not unlikely that the first pages of the part-book, which include "Western Wind," were penned in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, but estimates of the song's date of origin vary from "ca. 1300" to "early 16th c."'16 What warrant is there for saying that the song substantially predates the manuscript? The burden to a famous carol, "Ichot a burde in boure bryght" (B. M. MS. Harley 2253) reads: Blow northerne wynd, sent Dou me my suetyng! 264 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="7">blow, nor~erne wynd, blou! blou! blou!17 This burden may antedate 1300 and be of folk origin.18 Leo Spitzer opposes the "simple, emotional, violent, dynamic, natural, and musical burden" to the "courtly, elaborate, intellectualized, (gen- erally) calm, static, didactic, and rhetorical stanzas."'19 He speaks of the burden as "poetic gossamer floating in the wind," "an outburst of lyrical emotion" originating "in a naive identification with the forces of nature," a "primitive longing." By association with "Blow, Northerne Wynd" and other poems, none of which provides the same experience as that of "Western Wind," the latter poem has come to be regarded by some scholars as a naive, primitive out- burst, originating with simple folk. We are told, for instance, that folk-songs are characteristically sung by women and concern wo- men's work and love, so that "Western Wind," assumed to be a folk-song burden, carries the "motive of woman's love in absence" and fits into a subgenre of "overheard complaints of women."20 But the wind and its relations to love (inspiring or desolating) proves a ubiquitous theme, as we have seen, for identifiable non-folk au- thors such as Chaucer as well as for anonymous non-folk poems reaching back to antiquity.21 That "Western Wind" much antedates its manuscript should not be assumed; for all we know the text was penned by a Tudor courtier who intended it as an original composi- tion or who perhaps intentionally varied known motifs.22 But no possibility should harden into an assumption which would involve distinctions between sentiments in song of court and of common or between poetic attitudes of the late medieval period and of the early Tudor period, for such distinctions are notoriously unreli- able.23 III I would not extend my caveat concerning assumptions of prove- nance to a distrust of every investigation into the historical context of "Western Wind." Quite the contrary. Historical inquiry estab- lishes, for example, that "Western Wind" first appeared as a text set to music and that the music, whether of popular or courtly origin, may have been chosen to suit meanings of the text.24 If this be so, the music suggests much. Written in what we would identify as a minor scale (without the raised seventh, as in the scale of white notes from D), the melody ascends first to the distinctive minor Charles Frey 265</page><page sequence="8">third at "wynde," repeats the note at "when," and then reminds the listener again of the minor third at "wyll" before descending, so that the minor and in this case plaintive effect is established from the start. The succeeding phrases beginning at "Cryst," "And," and the first syllable of "Agayne" are all initiated from the minor third (that is, from b-flat in this g-Dorian mode) which then descends a half-step. Thus the half-step descent at "when wyll" (repeated at "wyll thow") becomes a structural unit which yields the same sound interval to the important textual junctures: "Cryst yf," "And I," "Agayne." The major melodic surprise comes not at "Cryst" but at "bed," the highest note in the piece (occurring only once) and the only leap of a fifth. Repeated curves of the ascending- descending phrases leading to "wyll thow blow," "downe can Rayne," and "in my Armys" and the curve toward the final syllable indicate a parallelism of meaning and tone. The coming of wind and rain connects closely and without strain to an imagined appear- ance of the speaker's "love" in embrace. All hints of radical shift after "Rayne" to a tone of anger, an altered pace, or any of the other dislocations detected by critics remain countermanded by the music. The word "Cryst," far from receiving blasphemous em- phasis, receives due weight as it is integrated into the rhythmic and melodic line. Final and major emphasis falls unmistakably upon the word "bed," and the piece closes through an energetic melisma and a final note slightly higher than the end note of the three preceding phrases. The relatively rapid succession of notes without extended duration in the decorative cadence and the ascending return to the tonic may possibly hint that the somber mood lightens a bit at the end. The music may not convert the often-assumed despondency of "yf' to confident anticipation, but the music does help to render the singer's longing, whether nostalgic or hopeful or both, finally rich and sustaining. To restore the poem to its musical setting is to lessen the danger of perceiving a "romantic cry" or a "generalized romantic excite- ment" in the first lines that is "all at once brought down to the realistic and literal" through a marked "contrast in tone."25 Such dangers tend, indeed, to be courted by critics who adopt an ahistor- ical stance and hence are attracted, understandably, to anonymous, brief, apparently simple and timeless lyrics. But when they ignore the setting of such a song, they are likely to modernize it falsely: they are likely to announce, for example, that "the nameless poet has refused to over-spiritualize nature."26 Better to announce that, 266 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="9">in the age from which this song springs, no one could de- spiritualize nature, much less over-spiritualize her. Historical inquiry, of course, can easily be abused. An inten- tionalist who, like the objectivist new critic, labors in the name of understanding poetry, would have us reconstruct for "Western Wind" a personalized historical background: Even with anonymous texts it is crucial to posit not simply some author or other, but a particular subjective stance in reference to which the construed context is rendered probable.27 Critics of medieval lyric who have interested themselves in such "subjective stance" have met, unfortunately, with less than as- tounding success.28 Working against individualized psychological reconstruction or sympathetic reenactment of the author's intention are the impersonality of a lyric such as "Western Wind," the ab- sence from it of an identifiably individual consciousness, and the submergence of authorial persona in the formulaic welter of the text.29 Yet, despite the hopelessness of positing a particularized auth- orial consciousness or intent, the best hope for apprehending the unity of "Western Wind" in its relations between wind, rain, Christ and love may reside in historical awareness. Without benefit of historical context, we tend to view the invocation of "Cryst" as radical and shocking, the intrusion upon the natural plane of the supernatural.30 It should be questioned, however, whether the ap- peal to Christ invokes such a different order of reality from that of the wind. Certainly in poems of the period Christ is presented as one who can gentle the winter wind of death and damnation: Blowe the winde style, and blow nat so shyl; My blode, man, I shed for the al at wyl. Blowe the winde style, and blowe nat so shyll; This paine to suffre is my Fathers wil. Or again: There blows a colde wynd todaye, todaye, The wynd blows cold todaye; Cryst sufferyd his passyon for manys salvacyon, to kype the cold wynd awaye.31 "Cryst" in "Western Wind" is not an intruded swearword or an exasperated expletive but a figure of highly relevant appeal. Christ is the active dispenser of time's gains and losses, of company and desolation: Charles Frey 267</page><page sequence="10">Anoder yere hit may betyde This compeny to be full wyde, And never onodyr here to abyde; Cryste may send now sych a yere.32 Even if the religious reference in "Western Wind" be taken with less salvational emphasis, it is consonant with the lover's sense of divine overview: "ye haue my hart ye haue my love / Gode sende me yours that syttyth above."33 Indeed, desolating comparisons be- tween nature's joy in spring and the lover's loneliness attuned to Christ's ordeal gather to a poetic topos in medieval English lyric.34 To suggest that, with the mention of "Cryst," the terms of the lover's grief in "Western Wind" do not radically change is to suggest that knowing the approximate age of the song and some- thing of its background may be relevant to our perception of it. I do not mean to say that the song is religious as opposed to secular or that its love is spiritual as opposed to bodily. I do think that a preliminary awareness of historical context should sharply inhibit any modernist tendency to exclude from the poem either term of such oppositions.35 One who hears the song sung and knows a bit of its background will find that the invocations to western wind and to Christ are parallel and closely related to each other. It is that sort of attention to setting which affords the proper base, I believe,jupon which to structure a syntatic and sonic analysis. IV Looking more closely at the poem's structure, we find, if we accept the basic parataxis of its four lines, a multiplication of inter- nal parallels. The essential sequence is: wynde. . . blow rayne. . . Rayne love (in my) Armys I (in my) bed. If the four-beat lines (the first and third) are associated, then blow- ing wind becomes analogized to lovemaking embrace, and rain rained down to lovers fallen abed. Thus the two sentences might each dramatize a fecundatory activity and a release down to bed of earth or home. The four lines work chiastically, as well, if one sees the lateral wind yielding to falling rain and the free-standing lovers falling to lateral bliss. Finite verbs and their auxiliaries present a regression toward 268 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="11">stasis: wyll blow, can rayne, were. Blowing and raining give way to a more static image of lovers locked in being. The final line is verbless, still. "Wyll," "can," and the subjunctive "were 1 under- line a movement from anticipation back toward memory, from actively-projected hope of love to nostalgic longing for it. "Agayne," at the end, points forward and backward; it contrasts with "when" and closes the poem with a two-syllable word to match the other two-syllable word, "Westron," which opened the poem. The appearance of closure is, however, deceptive: "when agayne?" pleads for melding of natural and human cycles, but the song's internal drama takes us out of nature. The verbal entropy from wide-ranging activity to local quietude is matched by a con- striction of focus from external to internal, from "thow" to "I," from the large, active, more general, less personal world to the restricted, progressively less animated, local and personal sphere-from "the" rain to "my" love, "my" arms, "my" bed. In the same way, prepositions take us from "rayne downe" to "in my armys" and "yn my bed." Through the humanly conjunctive scene of the third and fourth lines-"yf. . . and"-shimmers an incertitude of expectation. Af- ter the vision of embracing lovers come the image of "I yn my bed," as if this twoness might become a oneness-post-coital and desexualized-and the speaker at last, as the music suggests, seek the "bed" not only through but perhaps beyond desire. In rhetori- cal terms, the question is whether the poem presents auxesis or meiosis. Is it climactic? Or anti-climactic? The question proves fundamental to each pair of lines. In each case, great things lead in mind to lesser: the wind to the small rain, the lovers in arms to the speaking "I" (not "we") in "my" (not "our") bed. Such hints of antithesis between climactic force in first and third lines and anti- climactic outcome in second and fourth are no doubt a cause of the persistently suspected reversal of time sequence, a kind of hysteron proteron, in the first two lines. That is, does the wind precede and bring or follow and blow away the rain? In the last two lines, the speaker's imagination may work subtractively vather than addi- tively. Many lovers would imagine themselves in bed and then supply their mate. Here, the embrace is first summoned up and the last line, without necessarily dismissing the lover, still suggests a retreat in mind to the sub-romantic security of the bed, a comfort almost too personal and deep for relational sharing. Charles Frey 269</page><page sequence="12">The rhetorical problem of closure pervades not only syntax but sonics. We have seen how, editorially, the question mark has flut- tered back and forth between ends of the first and second lines. A reader or speaker immediately identifies the first line as a poten- tially complete question, but upon reading the next line he may suspect that the question, in spite of elided connectives, continues. It takes the second line to produce a phonic cycle from the narrowly approached frontal vowels of the first four words-"Westron wynde when wyll"-through the open, back vowels of "thow blow the smalle" to the relative closure of the repeated rayne." We find, in other words, that the first line is proleptic: wind does not blow in isolation, it changes the weather. In the second two lines, the con- nective "and" stands out starkly; the love in arms turns out to be incomplete as the imagination again turns downward to inanimate substance. Rain and bed prove to be the essential supportive con- texts as invocations of spirits in first and third lines extend them- selves and sink toward material substrata. v Though guided by implicit generalizations, stylistic analysis of the sort employed above works inductively as the mind gathers features into devices, devices into meanings, meanings into signifi- cance. One eventually must ascend from microscopic analysis of the surface, for all parts of the poem point to comparisons be- tween the first two lines and the second two, between the endless life of nature and the human wish for it. Yielding up a restricted focus upon the linguistic artifact, one tends to interpret the song more expansively, to search out, particularly, its relations backward toward the glimmering twilight of our literary history and forward to this present.36 Among older analogues is the vision of Chaucer's dreamer in the Book of the Duchess who imagines himself waking from his bed and sallying forth in a dawn of hunters to be led, presently, through a flowered "grene" where: both Flora and Zephirus, They two that makes floures growe, Had mad her dwellynge ther, I trowe; For hit was, on to beholde, As thogh the erthe envye wolde To be gayer than the heven. (402-07) 270 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="13">Here, the western wind "makes" the flowers grow; indwelling Zephirus inspires growth and love through nature's realm.37 In "Western Wind," the figure of"Cryst" intrudes to remind us, again, that earth indeed would be "gayer than the heven." Christ's life and death meanings are here mixed: He properly grants the prayers of medieval lovers and restores them to each others' arms, yet He remains the exemplum of arms nailed forever open. He is alone among men even as He reaches out to them. The appeal to Him, ultimately, must be tinged with a knowledge of loss and gain inex- tricably intertwined. In each poem, beyond the love-dreamer's bed ("yn my bed Agayne," "in my bed al naked": Duchess, 292), lies the later bed of death with its own tenuous promise. The more we consider the song, the less possible it becomes to know whether the yearning and pained imagining leaves the speaker less alone, or more alone, or both. The nature of the solace sought becomes deeper and deeper to sound. We may think of a male Western Wind (Zephirus) cooperating with maternal showers, or perhaps of Mother West Wind and seminal dew, or of other combinations, but "Cryst," at the last, takes us beyond differen- tiated genders in embrace. The semidivine conjugation of wind, rain, and earth, finds reenactment in human love, and then human love begins to be sacralized. To set the song in the late middle ages is to seek the wedding that preceded our modernist divorce of na- ture spirits and human spirits and of natural and supernatural co- yearnings. Surely the author would have shunned an age when "the human Amor seemed no longer a parable of the Divine Love but its blasphemous parody."38 The poem, indeed, issues from an era when Western thought strove to reconcile classical Eros and Christ- ian agape, as in the medieval lyric refrain: "Deus amet puellam."39 The western wind and small rain can constitute, moreover, natura praegnabilis, a force which leads without disjuicture to the prayed-for benignity of "Cryst" toward the lovers, as if in the think- ing characteristic of the age "a feminine power invades the concept of the Godhead."40 A lingering hint of profanation sorts, nonetheless, with the tenor of that time when the ascetic and celibate trials of religious devo- tion were so often taken as the ideal image of the lover's languish- ing despondency.41 Such profanation, of course, becomes self- consciously significant only in association with the artifice of alle- gory (as in the Romance of the Rose). Our poem provides a "deeper Charles Frey 271</page><page sequence="14">penetration of the sensory and the creatural" and, in its kinesthetic flux of wind, rain, love, arms, and bed, exemplifies the plangent realism typical of the late northern middle ages when men's rela- tion to earth's passionate weather could combine "acceptance of its existing forms as an intensely expressive pageantry and radical un- masking of it as transitory and vain."42 The implications of the wind turn out to be total: the wind is that bringing which takes away, that coming of life which alone opens up unfathomable vistas of loss.

Inspection of microfilm and photographic print suggests that the twelfth word may not be "rayne" (which editors universally have assumed it to be). The first letter of that word does not resemble other instances of r in the same hand, or in other hands in the MS., or as r was variously written at the time. The letter may be an odd or incompletely-formed R. Other possibilities include b, v, w, and abbreviated dr or vr, all of which would create words that could fit the context. "Bayne" would mean to moisten, soak, or drench: OED, "bain," v., (1). And see Hans Kurath and Sherman M. Kuhn, Middle English Dictionary, Part A. 1. (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1956), p. 611, "bainen," v., (1). But cf. MED, "bain," adj., 3. (b): "bai had wynde and wedir bayne, And parfore . . wende sone to have commyn hame." "Wayne" could mean "wane," to ebb or subside (sometimes used of water: see OED, "wane," v., Lc), or "wayne" could mean "wain" (spelled both "vayne" and "wayne"), to rush or pour down: "A thondir with a thicke Rayne thrublit in be skewes. . . As neuer water from the welkyn hade waynit before" (OED, "wain," v., 3.). The readings "drayne" and "vrayne" would be based upon regarding the mark over the first two letters of the word as an abbreviation mark. "Drayne" could have our contemporary meaning, to drain off, or could mean "to let fall in drops strained out" as in 2 Henry VI (3.2. 141-43; in the Folio, quoted here, l1. 1843-45): "Faine would I go ... to draine/Upon his face an Ocean of salt tears ...." Vrayne," possibly a Kentish form on "frayne" (see OED, "fray," v. 1, 2. b.) would mean to disperse or drive away.

Moore, The Secular Lyric in Middle English (Lexington, Ky.: Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1951), pp. 29-30, prints a question mark after "blow" but treats the rain as longed for. 7 Richard R. Griffith, "Westron Wynde When Wyll Thow Blow," Explicator, 21 (1963), No. 69, in arguing that "can" is a variant ofgan, past of ginnen, "do," says: "our modern word can, stemming from ken in the sense of 'know how to,' was rarely used until recently without a sentient subject." But no authority is supplied for the allega- tion of rarity. One need only consult Chaucer to find "Blessed be Love, that kan thus folk converte!" (TC 308) and, in praise of the brass horse in the Squire's Tale, "Nature ne art koude hym nat amende" (197). For other examples, see MED, Part C. 1., pp. 518-19: "connen." "Can," in "Western Wind," might possibly be intended as an infinitive in the sense of"be able to": see OED, "can," v., A. 5. A paraphrase would then read: "Western wind, wvhen will thou blow, [when will] the small rain down can [i.e., be able to] rain." 8 It is generally so in Ovid, Horace and other classical poets and in European folklore and poetry, generally. And compare Campion's "Peaceful Western Wind" which tames winter storms and brings spring growth though it leads the lovelorn poet, as in "Western Wind," to bewail his personal loss, in quasi-religious terms, of love's grace. 9 In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is described that "seson of somor with the soft windes, / When Zeferus sifles himself on sedes and erbes; / Wela-winne is the wort that waxes theroute, / When the donkande dewe dropes of the leves, / To bide a blisful blusch of the bright sunne" (516-20). And compare the verse from the song of Moses in Charles Frey 273</page><page sequence="16">Deut. 32.2 (Authorized Version): "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass." If this be read chiastically, dew and small rain blend. 'I From Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, ed. Henry B. Wheatly (Lon- don: George Allen and Unwin, 1885), III, 147. Ritson, in Ancient Songs (1790), p. lv, noticed the resemblance of "Western Wind" to this quatrain. 11 Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballards (Boston: Hougton, 1885), Vol. II, Pt. I, 236; No. 78, "The Unquiet Grave." Bertrand Harris Bronson, The Traditional Tunes of the Child Ballads (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1962), IL, 234, speculates that this stanza from "The Unquiet Grave," an early carol stanza beginning "There blows a colde wynd todaye" (at n. 31, below), and the text of "Western Wind" all belong to a group of old secular songs with elegiac refrains. In describing the Lincolnshire uprising of 1536 and its aftermath Richard Grafton (completing Hall's Chronicle for the final years of Henry VIII's reign) mentions a "smal raine" which flooded a ford and, as if a "great miracle of God," prevented hostile forces from fighting. This "smal raine" was no spring shower; it fell in October, and yet Grafton found the phrase appropriate. See Hall's Chronicle (London: J. Johnson, 1809), p. 825. 12 Rosemond Tuve, Seasons and Months: Studies in a Tradition of Middle English Poetry (Paris: Librairie Universitaire, 1933), p. 173, gets at analogous medieval views of the "properties of the season" partly through reference to the "Gest Hys- toriale" of the Destruction of Troy and its description of harvest coming into cold: "'Trees, thurgh tempestes, tynde hade kere leues ... The wynde of the west . .. Blowyng full bremly o the brode ythes ... And wintur vp wacknet with his wete aire."' It is possible that, until recent times, the west wind was generally recognized as the autumn wind and the western wind as the spring wind. 13 "By a blasphemous implication Christ is in effect assigned the role of a fertility spirit." F. W. Bateson, English Poetry: A Critical Introduction, rev. ed. (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966), p. 60. 14 Warren, KR (1943), 23, says that the poem moves from the "generalized and romantic" in the first lines to the "realistic and specific" at the end. Stauffer, Nature of Poetry, p. 63, reverses the movement: "Two lines of description, two of emotion." The adjectives "Western" and "small," he says, are "exactly chosen" for the sake of "sharpness." Ciardi divides the poem into "generalized lament" and "specific pro- test" and finds a "fulcrum" after the first two lines which marks a sudden change in diction, metrics, pace, sound and tone: How Does a Poem Mean?, pp. 996-98. But there is little in the text, surely, to justify such radical discriminations among its parts. What stands out most clearly is the overwhelming parallelism of the lines. The whole is in the optative mood: "wind," "rain," "love," and "bed" may well be correlative goals. The very structure of the quatrain with its x-a-y-a rhyme reinforces the parallelism. No signal shift occurs in diction or pace. The "m" and "n" sounds predominate throughout. One imagines a progressively narrowed and internalized scene. Whoever put the words and music together, certainly, failed to notice or else ignored disjunctures of the sort imagined: the minor-sounding key or mode (a trans- posed Dorian) never changes, the basically 4/4 meter carries into the second two lines, and three melodic phrases curve toward the same note at "blow," "Rayne," and "Armys." There are, admittedly, differences (as well as similarities) to be reck- oned with in the appeal to wind and appeal to Christ, but to manufacture stylistic fulcrums and wedges for the poem is to obscure and even to attack its impressive wholeness. 15 Woman's complaint: E.

John Ward, "The Lute Music of MS Royal Appendix 58," Journal of the American Musicological Society, 13 (1960), 117, says of the part-book: "Nothing appears to be known of the history of the manuscript." According to Ward, the pieces appear in varied hands and were written at various times, most of the vocal music c. 1520-25, the lute music after 1550. See also Ward's article, "The Dolful Dumps,"JAMS, 4 (1951), 112 n. 4. Three Masses composed by John Taverner, Christopher Tye and John Shepherd, probably in the second quarter of the century have become known by the captions "Westron Wynde" and "The Westerne Wynde" (B. M. Addl. MSS. 17802-05.). The Masses are based on the same melody, and this melody, though it differs from the tenor melody to "Western Wind" in R. A. 58, could be an altered version of a treble part (now lost) above that tenor. See Nigel Davison, "The Western Wind Masses," Musical Quar- terly, 57 (1971), 427-43, who speculates: "My conclusion is that in about 1510 the teenage, and technically incompetent, Henry made an arrangement of the folksong or popular song Western Wynde. He put the melody in the tenor and for his treble wrote something akin to the cantus of the Mass settings.... As to why Taverner c[h]ose this particular tune, I sugggest ... that the attraction was to use the royal descant of a well-known tune" (431-34). '7English Lyrics of the XllIth Century, ed.

The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite begins: "I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and beautiful, whose dominion is the walled cities of all sea-set Cyprus.

Evelyn-White, trans., in Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica, new and rev. ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1936), p. 427. The late Latin Vigil of Venus portrays a vernal Venus who " 'with the breath of the Western Wind, swells trembling bosoms / into blossoming buds; she sprinkles the sparkling dewdrops, / those glistening waters left by the winds of night.' " James J. Wilhelm, The Cruelest Month: Spring, Nature, and Love in Classical and Medieval Lyrics (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1965), p. 10. 22 According to Robbins, Secular Lyrics, p. xxxviii, "Western Wind," "often er- roneously cited as a choice specimen of popular verse, is quite a sophisticated piece." Rosemary Woolf, "Later Poetry: The Popular Tradition," in The Middle Ages, ed. Bolton, p. 279, says that "there is no evidence that so masterly a verse ever Charles Frey 275</page><page sequence="18">sprang from the untrained imagination of the common people, and it is therefore more likely to be the work of an educated poet who drew for his style and effects upon the traditions of folk poetry." Arthur K. Moore, The Secular Lyric, p. 30, neatly hedges on this point, at first appearing to treat "Western Wind" as an early, em- bryonic and "elemental" outcry, but then cautioning: "Although these full-throated exclamations strike directly to the heart of human affairs, they are not for that folk song. Theoretically, a learned poet could at any time slough off the complex of conditioning and qualifying factors which he brings to bear on simple impulse and then express such exquisite naivete as early medieval lyric occasionally affords." The MS. spellings, for the most part, are consonant with a fifteenth-century or early sixteenth-century origin, though "Westron" could be a survival from earlier. 23 See John Stevens, Music and Poetry in the Early Tudor Court, pp. 8-23, 44, 54, 127-32. 24 See Catherine Ing, Elizabethan Lyrics (London: Chatto and Windus, 1951), pp. 114-15; Stevens, Music and Poetry, pp. 37, 44, 69, 102-03; Ernest Walker, A History of Music in England, 3rd ed. rev. by J. A. Westrup (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952), p. 368; Bruce Pattison, Music and Poetry of the English Renaissance (London: Meth- uen, 1948), p. 82. To Nigel Davison, "The Western Wind Masses," n. 16 above, "It seems very clear that this melody, with its irregular phrase lengths, was intended for no other words than these" (428). The relation of music to text is presented in facsimile by Davison and in printed transcription by Ritson, n. 3 above; the tran- scriptions by Stevens, Davison, and others who regularize the meter in various ways all have dubious value. Whether the music was composed with the words in mind or the words were composed with the music in mind or separately-conceived words and music were later joined, the decision to join them constitutes a declaration of appropriate relation which is worth examining. As the authorities cited above make plain, questions of the degree to which tunes in this period may be taken to express, illustrate, or appreciate the sentiments in the texts are enormously complex. In arguing that the music does suit the text, I am relying upon historical possibility and upon the temporal patterns of expectation and surprise in the music itself. I refer the interested reader to the seminal discussion by Leonard B. Meyer, Emotion and Meaning in Music,(Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1956). See, particularly, his discussion of the affective power of the minor mode in Western music, pp. 222-29. 25 Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, edd., Understanding Poetry, 3rd ed.

Stevick, "The Criticism of Middle English Lyrics," MP, 64 (1966), 104, criticizes Arthur K. Moore's analysis of "Western Wind" (in The Secular Lyric) for trying to "provide an account of the poem's genesis by hypothesizing, again, the poet's lyric impulse." "Inferences about the poet's imagination, or creative faculty, of consciousness," according to Stevick, "seem to be about as untrustworthy as grounds for evaluation as they are deficient in providing a satisfactory accounting of the poem" (108-09). 29 Compare Catherine Ing, Elizabethan Lyrics, pp. 15-16: "Lyric of this kind . is not usually original in any of the more obvious senses, and it is impersonal. It does not matter to us that its author is often Anon. I do not know that anyone has ever tried to find out who wrote 'Western wind, when wilt thou blow?', or even wondered who wrote it, except in the very vaguest way; whereas I suspect that even if we did not know who wrote the Ode to the West Wind, we should tend to feel that the question of its authorship was a matter of some importance... . 30 As in Ciardi, How Does a Poem Mean?, p. 998. 31 The Early English Carols, ed. Richard Leighton Greene (Oxford: Clarendon 276 Interpreting "Western Wind"</page><page sequence="19">Press, 1935): "Blowe the winde styl," p. 128, No. 171; "There blows a colde wynd todaye," p. 127, No. 170. 32Early English Carols, p. 77, No. 121. 33 R. A. 58, fol. 6. See also Robbins, Secular Lyrics, p. 158, No. 169. 34 Such lyrics as "Western Wind" and the older songs, "Nu yh she blostme sprynge" and "Foweles in the frith" (Brown, English Lyrics of the XIIlth Century, p. 120, No. 63, p. 14, No. 8, and concerning "Foweles" see Edmund Reiss, The Art of the Middle English Lyric [Athens, Ga.: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1972], pp. 19-20) derive, ultimately, from the great mythic and ritual perceptions, in classical and Christian traditions, of the "dark side of spring," of the many dimensions of loss and loneliness shadowed in its transient joy. See Wilhelm, The Cruelest Month, esp. pp. 30-60. We should remember that, just as "small rain" is not deprived of its justness by prior usage, so the whole poem is not demeaned or drained of freshness by prior instances of the topos. Compare C. S. Lewis, The Discarded Image (Cambridge: Univ. Press, 1964), p. 200: "It is Nature-the character of shifting light and shade, of trees and running water and a gentle breeze, and their effect on human nerves and emotions-which caused the locus to be amoenus, and only therefore to be com- munis." 35 That is, one need not be a devotee of patristic exegesis to apprehend the natur- alness of the appeal to "Cryst" in "Western Wind." A patristic exegete might be tempted to apply the notion that the "courtly love situation, for example, may echo the Song of Songs, thereby calling up an ideal of Christian love" (Reiss, Art of the Middle English Lyric, p. xiii), but even the highly relevant invocation of Boreas and Zephyr in the Song of Songs, 4.16, as summoning the beloved analogized to Christ, fails to serve as allegorical matrix for "Western Wind," because not only did medieval poets habitually secularize the Biblical wind/messenger motif but also the images of "arms" locked in embrace and "bed" holding the lovers are so vigorous and self-sustaining that they mock attempted breakthrough to allegory. See Peter Dronke, The Medieval Lyric (London: Hutchinson Univ. Lib., 1968), pp. 174-75, and Wilhelm, The Cruelest Month, pp. 38, 100-01. In short, the appeal to "Cryst" can be taken seriously without indulging in the patristic fallacy where "one has the poem going in one direction and its teaching going in the opposite." E. Talbot Donaldson, "Patristic Exegesis in the Criticism of Medieval Literature: The Opposition," in Critical Approaches to Medieval Literature, ed. Dorothy Bethurum (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1960), p. 15. 36 John Speirs, Medieval English Poetry: The Non-Chaucerian Tradition (London: Faber, 1957), pp. 48-49, pleads for freedom from constricting historical focus in interpretation of medieval lyrics; the twentieth century reader must respond "in his own way" and not just account for the poetry but value it. Still, we may best ap- preciate a centuries-old poem if we bring to it not only our contemporary perspective and techniques of stylistic analysts but also a respect for its age and the meanings which its origins may have for us. 37 A. C. Spearing, Criticism and Medieval Poetry, 2nd ed. (London: Edward Ar- nold, 1972), pp. 14-15, speaks of the "almost anthropomorphic way in which the Dreamer sees the forest." The speaker in "Western Wind," in a related manner1 assimilates wind and rain to the embracing lovers and their seminal act. 38 W. H. Auden, ed., Medieval and Renaissance Poets (New York: Viking, 1950), p. xxx. 39 Compare the discussion of "Blow, Northerne Wynd" by Peter Dronke, Medieval Latin and the Rise of European Love-Lyric, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), I, 124: "the customary 'honouring' of Christ by mankind is reversed, it is he who is asked to accord reverence to the poet's beloved." The effect is that "words that summon the highest veneration of the beloved are fused with the words of elemental longing for her." Charles Frey 277</page><page sequence="20">40 Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harper, 1953), p. 122. 41 This "spirit of the epoch" is perhaps most compellingly described and documented in J. Huizinga's famous study, The Waning of the Middle Ages (1924, rpt. Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1956), pp. 311, 314, 334. 42 Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, trans. Willard Trask (1953, rpt. Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1957), p. 219. Stephen Manning, Wisdom and Number: Toward a Critical Appraisal of the En- glish Religious Lyric (Lincoln, Neb.: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1962), p. 31, points out the frequent aim of medieval lyrics to enhance the listener's acceptance of paradoxes and enable him "to accept mysteries which he is unable to grasp intellec- tually." The appeal to the son of God in the poem must remain as troubling for us as the statement that the rain "can" rain, or else we, like some modern editors, will seek our divinity without a nous, or Christ without a crux. 278 Interpreting "Western Wind""</page></plain_text>
