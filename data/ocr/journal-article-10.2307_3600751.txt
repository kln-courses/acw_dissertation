Emblematic of British engineering skill and financial might in the nineteenth century, the railway seemed to be symbolic of national decline in the twentieth, the scaling down of the nationalized network in the 1960s mirroring the concurrent retreat from empire. The romance of the steam engine lived on in the imagination, however, appealing to nostalgia for a puta- tive golden age of security and social stability in Britain's past. On a more mundane level, in the post-war era, the state of the British Rail sandwich became a frequent topic of conversation, while everyone bemoaned the fact that neither party seemed to be able to make the trains run on time. The privatization of the industry in the 1990s by the Major government pushed rail- ways to the centre of political debate once more. The step was criticized on both moral and practical grounds, with many arguing that the extra subsidies pumped into the system had been used not to improve the network, but to line the pockets of 'fat cat' directors, while the safety of passengers had been scandalously neglected. A series of high-profile crashes has reinforced the anger and frustration felt by the public, feel- ings which have increasingly found voice in books, plays and *This article was first presented as a paper at the 'British History, 1815-1945' seminar at the Institute of Historical Research in 2003.

Yet for all the vitriol of recent treatments of the state of Britain's railways, nineteenth-century attitudes to the subject were every bit as emotionally charged. Early responses to the railways were enthusiastic: the opening day of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830 was attended by the leading lights of the Tory government, including the duke of Wellington, Robert Peel and (alas for him) William Huskisson. One report noted that 'Liverpool was never so full of strangers ... All the inns in the town were crowded to overflowing ... Never was there such an assemblage of rank, wealth, beauty, and fashion in this neighbourhood'.2 The excitement was also echoed in the art of the period. Works depicting the architectural and engineering splendours of the new railways, including Thomas Bury's series of paintings of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, David Octavius Hill's engravings of the Gamkirk and Glasgow Railway, and John Cooke Bourne's lithographs of the London and Birmingham and Great Western railways, attested to the contemporary fascination with the new technology. Slightly later, in 1844, J. M. W. Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed revealed a profound emotional reaction to the railways, a min- gled awe and terror nicely conveyed by William Makepeace Thackeray's description of the picture: 'there comes a train down upon you, really moving at the rate of fifty miles an hour, and which the reader had best make haste to see, lest it should dash out of the picture, and be away up Charing Cross through the wall opposite'.3 These wonders were made possible by the joint-stock system of business organization, which, circumventing the law of part- nership, enabled the money of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of investors to come together to finance capital-intensive projects. The state delegated corporate powers to railway companies, and 'Ian Jack, The Crash That Stopped Britain (London, 2001); Andrew Murray, Off the Rails: Britain's Great Railway Crisis (London, 2001); David Hare, The Permanent Way (London, 2003).

But the emergence of this form of commercial enterprise did not come without its problems. Companies were widely thought to be inherently monopolistic, inefficient and extravagant, and their promotion encouraged indecent gambling in shares which drew capital away from legitimate trade. Historians are beginning to realize that the nineteenth century did not see a straightforward shift from 'moral economy' to 'political economy', for the Victorians were quite obviously preoccupied with the ethics of commerce.4 A recurrent theme in the running debate on commercial moral- ity was the joint-stock company, and argument here often focused on the railway because this was the most visible and most important manifestation of joint-stock activity from the 1830s. This really was 'big business': the London and North Western Railway's nominal capital of ?29 million in 1851 made it the largest industrial enterprise in the world.5 From Karl Marx's enigmatic comments on the 'great railway swindle'6 to Herbert Spencer's extended study of 'railway morals', both the ethical and the political aspects of railway enterprise attracted extensive comment.7 This peaked, but did not cease, with the 'railway mania' of the 1840s, for the issues went beyond specu- lation in shares. The management of large industrial concerns such as the railways, involving huge amounts of capital, and negotiation with large workforces, landowners, politicians and shareholders, raised difficult questions. Did the interests of 4 G. R.

If not, how could they be made to do so? Who should be held accountable for the actions of corporations, and how? Contemporary responses to these questions have begun to be explored in works by Timothy L. Alborn, Frank Dobbin and R. W. Kostal.8 They make important contributions by investigat- ing how issues of corporate governance were addressed in the courts, in Parliament, at the Board of Trade and in the main- stream press. But in none of these is the cultural dimension to the debate considered.9 Questions of railway morality and railway management surfaced in novels and plays and, even more promi- nently, in cartoons and verse through these years. These sources give a valuable insight into how joint-stock enterprise was popu- larly imagined, but they have been neglected. While Michael Freeman's recent overview of the cultural effects of the railways reproduces, and includes comment on, several cartoons, his sec- tions on railway enterprise rely heavily on those images produced in response to the railway mania of 1845-7.10 Jack Simmons has dealt with cartoons across a wider period, but only those appear- ing in Punch." This article examines a much broader sample of cartoons and verse from fifteen satirical magazines of the early to mid Victorian period, in order to explore how the Victorians set about assembling a visual language enabling them to represent large companies. The results shed light both on popular per- ceptions of railway enterprise, and on cultural attitudes to 'big business' more generally.12 These magazines' self-conscious and ostentatious advocacy of the 'public interest' makes it particularly 8Timothy L.

Did depictions evolve at a time when the laws regulating not just railway com- panies, but also joint-stock companies more generally, were undergoing a rapid and radical transformation?14 After examining representations of the railway during the speculative 'mania' of the 1840s, the article goes on to consider how these developed in the 1850s and 1860s, focusing on the image of the director. It argues that although they largely man- aged to avoid continued association with fraud and achieved a certain level of respectability, directors were widely perceived as grasping and negligent, endangering the lives of their cus- tomers for their own profit. While passengers were viewed as the principal victims of railway boards, there is evidence of a significant alteration in attitudes to shareholders, who, though initially tarred by their association with greedy speculation, came to be viewed as the innocent dupes of directors who exploited them as they exploited passengers. Such a critique of railway politics was founded on the belief that, in practice, shareholders had less power over boards than they possessed in theory, but it also ignored the inescapable fact that sharehold- ers were ultimately the driving force behind the policies of profit maximization pursued by their directors. In railways as in other sectors, shareholders were only roused from their wonted passivity by a dip in dividends; this meant that to maintain the support of shareholders, directors had to safeguard dividends.15 (n. 12 cont.)

But satirists did not pursue this theme, instead focusing all of their wrath on directors, and in so doing found themselves slotting railway politics into the tried and trusted paradigm of 'Old Corruption'. I Bearing in mind the ephemeral nature of the Victorian satirical press, Punch was remarkable for its longevity: while it engen- dered a host of imitators, these usually struggled to establish much of a foothold, disappearing after a few years, sometimes after just a few weeks.16 Despite Punch's influence, there was a degree of diversity in the politics and outlook of its rivals. Pup- pet-Show and Fun, for example, were outspokenly Liberal, and, by a combination of popular politics and a low price, attempted to secure a wider readership than Punch. Judy and Tomahawk, on the other hand, were solidly Conservative, though both also sold for less than Punch's 3d.17 These political distinctions could influence comment on the railway: while Puppet-Show highlighted the plight of third-class passengers, Punch was more concerned to voice the interests of those travelling second- class.'8 Nevertheless, the similarities between the magazines' treatments of railway enterprise outweighed the differences, and it is possible to analyse them as a relatively coherent group. The greater part of the modest literature on Victorian humour concentrates on Punch, and has usually explained the magazine's success in terms of its willingness to shed its early radicalism.19 In his essay 'The English Sense of Humour', 16 For a survey of the nineteenth-century satirical press, see J. Don Vann, 'Comic Periodicals', in J. Don Vann and Rosemary T. VanArsdel (eds.), Victorian Period- icals and Victorian Society (Toronto, 1994). 17 Attempts to undercut Punch met with only limited success: while Punch's sales were consistently around the forty thousand mark in the mid Victorian period, Fun and Tomahawk peaked at around ten or twenty thousand: Alvar Ellegird, The Readership of the Periodical Press in Mid-Victorian Britain (G6teborg, 1957), 35. 18 Puppet-Show, i (1848), 192; Punch, xix (1850), 171. 19 Richard D.

Price, A History of Punch (London, 1957).</page><page sequence="7">BUSINESS IN PICTURES 117 Harold Nicolson argued that in the later 1850s Punch 'decided that it would prove more profitable to comfort the bourgeois than to insult them'.20 This view of Punch's drift towards respect- ability has characterized subsequent accounts.21 Nicolson's comments on the trademarks of Punch's humour have also been influential: for him, the key aspects were the tendency to ridicule the unfamiliar, and the keenness 'to flatter and console' readers.22 Such remarks suggest an unchallenging and politi- cally tame kind of humour, in contrast to the more scurrilous and controversial wit which had flourished in Georgian times. But this interpretation is something of a generalization, which is not borne out when Punch's treatment of the railway is con- sidered. These cartoons have been viewed as further evidence of Punch's political trajectory from the 1850s: Freeman, for example, argues that they are characterized by a tone of 'benev- olent indulgence'.23 But these cartoons, and those of its rivals, were in fact consistently critical of the railway, often with an outspokenness that can startle and surprise. Yet their criticisms were not the product of simple-minded conservatism or fear of the new and unfamiliar. Indeed, attacks on the railway by land- owners or Sabbatarians were themselves ridiculed by the maga- zines.24 Moreover, the image of the railway was often employed in the satirical press as an unambiguous symbol of progress in a variety of national and international contexts. The radical Figaro in London depicted Daniel O'Connell as a railway engine to represent the idea of political progress.25 The Liberal Pasquin carried a cartoon showing the train of 'Public Busi- ness', driven by Lord John Russell, being obstructed by an irre- sponsible Disraeli, who is apprehended by John Bull.26 A cartoon of 1845 in Joe Miller the Younger presented the 'Railway of Science' running over the papal bull.27 The image of the railway was used in Punch to symbolize both the spirit of improvement 20 Nicolson, English Sense of Humour, 49. 21 Susan and Asa Briggs, Cap and Bell: Punch's Chronicle of English History in the Making, 1841-61 (London, 1972), pp. xi-xxxiv; Simmons, 'Powerful Critic of Railways', 133. 22 Nicolson, English Sense of Humour, 51, 53. 23 Freeman, Railways and the Victorian Imagination, 102. 24Punch, xix (1850), 140, 159. 25Figaro in London, vi (1837), 14. 26 Pasquin, i (1850), 57. 27 Joe Miller the Younger, new ser., i (1845), facing p. 136.</page><page sequence="8">118 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 189 in China and the cause of Italian unification,28 while Puppet- Show associated railways with 'the advance of intelligence'.29 Early satirical representations of the railway are perhaps the most predictable. The novelty of rail travel before Victoria's reign (at the end of 1837, only 540 miles of track had become operational)30 bred a degree of antipathy and suspicion, and comment was often sceptical. The ambitions of the propon- ents of steam travel were easily satirized, and cartoons of the 1820s and 1830s focused on the apparent absurdity of the 'progress of steam' and the 'march of intellect'. These car- toons made fun of the wild and improbable plans for steam travel, and showed the unfortunate effects on the horses which would be rendered unemployed by them.31 In 1836 Figaro in London expressed its disappointment that everybody was 'in such a devil of a hurry' both to travel on railroads and to speculate in them.32 But it was not until the speculative mania which began in 1845 that railways attracted sustained comment in satirical magazines. Cartoons of this period stressed the dynamic and destructive power of the engines as a means of conveying the devastation wrought by speculation in railway shares. The railway was depicted as a monster, a serpent, or a demon, ruining the lives of investors. An illustration from Puppet-Show portrays the rail- way as an anthropomorphized land serpent which is gobbling up its investors, depicted as plump and helpless moneybags (Plate 1). The accompanying text explains that the 'greedy' and 'brazen' monster consumes 'every kind of man ... From the dullest lord of thousands, to the poorest scamp on town'.33 Clearly the fortunes of thousands of investors are required to sate the appetite of this terrible beast. Another illustration, from George Cruikshank's Table-Book, portrays the railway in a very similar way: the engine is a dragon invading John Bull's 28Punch, xxv (1853), 97-8; ibid., xliii (1862), 151. 29 Puppet-Show, iii (1849), 58. 30Peter Mathias, The First Industrial Nation: An Economic History of Britain, 1700-1914 (London, 1969), 280. 31 Francis D.

These cartoons con- veyed such anxieties, and also the trauma caused by the rail- ways' growing domination of the landscape. The Land Serpent, its tail trailing off into infinity, is master of its habitat - Britain. These monsters occupied the whole country, and with their powers of compulsory purchase were, like the Railway Dragon, invading homes and spreading misery.38 Interestingly, however, the directors of railway companies tended not to feature prominently in cartoons of the 1840s: the symbolism of the railway engine dominated visually. But George Hudson was an exception. From humble origins, he built up a huge empire by ruthless and corrupt means, control- ling at the peak of his power almost 1,500 miles of line. A phys- ically imposing man, his bulk mirrored the brute force of the railways he directed. His head, according to a contemporary, was 'a formidable-looking engine . . . as round and as stern- looking as a forty-two pounder' and set on his massive frame 34 George Cruikshank's Table-Book, i (1845), facing p. 261. 35 John George, A View of the Existing Law Affecting Unincorporated Joint Stock Companies (London, 1825), 73; Times, 9 Oct. 1840; ibid., 9 Nov. 1840. 36Anon., 'The Stock Exchange, No. II', Fraser's Mag., iv (1832), 721; Anon., The Real Del Monte Mining Concerns Unmasked, and a Few Facts on Stock Jobbing Schemes, with a View to Prevent the Public from Becoming the Dupes of Self-Interested Speculators and Adventurers (London, 1833), 10-11. 37 Times, 4 Sept. 1845.

His crown was made up of rail- way smokestacks, his whole being was composed of railway parts (Plate 2). Such representations made the point that this man shared the destructive powers of the trains he directed.40 Hudson's nickname, 'the railway king', nodded towards the idea that the railway directors were becoming the new elite. His rise prompted concerns that joint-stock enterprise was turning the social hierarchy upside down. In a piece entitled 'Railway Revolution', Joe Miller the Younger expressed the fear that A new aristocracy will arise, just as the present did in their beginning; that is, out of a fraud upon the existing state of society ... Then we shall have, instead of our Stanleys . . . our Marquises of the Direct Northern, our Viscounts Branch, Extension, Amalgamation, and Canal Conversions . . . and the family names of these; the Jenkinses, the Wigginses, the Hobbses, the Dobbses, the Joneses, and the Bugginses, with smoking hot potatoes, ginger-beer bottles, and penny tarts for their illustrious crests.41 But as this extract suggests, the challenge to the existing order was not always taken seriously, and the pretensions of the railway upstarts were roundly mocked. Their 'sparkling jewel- lery and bad grammar', their 'rustling silks and vulgar expres- sions' gave much pleasure to satirical commentators.42 They were social and business frauds whose spell in the limelight would be brief. In the pages of the satirical press, the typical railway director was, like Hudson, a vulgar man of low birth, a charlatan who had got rich quick but who would receive his come-uppance in due course. The few cartoons which featured directors stated these ideas with much force, such as the one from Joe Miller the Younger shown in Plate 3. Although they cultivated an appearance of respectability and wealth, this car- toon argues, railway directors had none of the substance. They were in fact cheap rogues, confidence tricksters who would make a fast buck then flee, usually without paying their landladies, 39 Richard S.

Towards the end of 1845, theatregoers were treated to Edward Stirling's topical farce The Railway King!, which fea- tured the fraudulent railway promoters Bob Shirk and Sam Stag, who graduated to the world of finance from petty crime at Epsom races.44 The magazines delighted in portraying the inevitable fall of railway rogues; the frequency of such portrayals suggests that readers found the restoration of the natural order comforting. One Punch cartoon, 'Melancholy Reverse of Fortune', depicted the railway director of 1845 as the road-sweeper of 1846.45 In the same vein, Mephystopheles carried a spoof advertisement placed by a former director offering a bonus of fourpence 'to any one who will procure for him a subordinate situation, as police- man, porter, guard, or stoker, in any of the railway companies; or, in fact, any honest employment'.46 After these fictional restor- ations of the natural order came Hudson's actual fall in 1849, when his years of creative accounting finally caught up with him.47 Of course, this reinforced the view that even if fraudsters managed to insinuate their way into society, they could never stay there, and, predictably, the magazines revelled in his fall from grace.48 Novels, too, were written which chronicled the rise and fall of crooked railway directors obviously based on Hudson.49 The most successful of these was Robert Bell's Ladder of Gold, serialized in Bentley's Miscellany, which ends with a chastened 43 Mephystopheles, i (1845-6), 1-2.

If he be wise, he will keep in his own sphere'.50 II Yet after mid century, the imagery used to depict railways underwent significant changes. As the joint-stock economy grew, and as agglomerations of capital became more common, the anthropomorphic railway engine, the ubiquitous symbol of the destructive power of joint-stock enterprise in cartoons of the 1840s, faded from view. Such apocalyptic visions of com- panies and speculation seemed ever less appropriate when increasing numbers were coming into contact with companies, both as customers and as shareholders. Acts between 1844 and 1862 enshrined the joint-stock company in law, giving legal protection to corporate property, and permitting general limited liability, thus encouraging the spread of the joint-stock principle.51 While satirical magazines continued to be critical of joint-stock enterprise, they used the image of the fiendish rail- way engine less frequently, and instead foregrounded the activities of company directors, who were coming to be seen as the principal villains of the joint-stock economy. Despite the enormous impact of Hudson's rise and fall, the association between railways and fraud did not persist in the 1850s. Admittedly, in the early 1850s, references to Swindleton Extensions, Gammontown Continuations and Bubbleton Junc- tions still abounded, which conjured up an image of railway enterprise as one gigantic fraud.52 But these critiques were los- ing validity. With the sustained flatness of the railway market after 1847, and the permanently depressed state of dividends, bubble schemes were not viable, and there was little scope for continuing to present railway boards as havens of corruption. Furthermore, banks seemed to be leading the way when it came to breathtaking acts of fraud, particularly after the Royal British Bank scandal of 1856, with the result that joint-stock 50 Bell, Ladder of Gold, 303. 5 Taylor, Creating Capitalism, ch. 5. 52 Punch, xviii (1850), 122.</page><page sequence="16">126 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 189 banking became the new favourite target of satirists keen to condemn financial chicanery.53 It became increasingly untenable to think of railway directors as fly-by-night characters bent on making quick profits. George Carr Glyn, chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1846 to 1852, was son of Sir Richard Carr Glyn, and was a wealthy London banker and Liberal MP. Edmund Beckett Denison, chairman of the Great Northern Railway from 1847 to 1864, was son of Sir John Beckett, sat as Conservative MP for the West Riding of Yorkshire and succeeded to the baronetcy in 1872. Samuel Laing, chairman of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway from 1848 to 1855 and again from 1867, was the son of the acclaimed author and traveller of the same name, was a Cambridge-educated lawyer who had served in the Railway Department of the Board of Trade and was later to sit on the Liberal benches in the Commons. Even more strikingly, in the second half of the nineteenth century, and particularly in the final quarter-century, the aristocratic presence on boards increased significantly: chairmen's salaries were particularly alluring to younger sons and cash-strapped landowners. The third duke of Buckingham was chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1853 to 1861, while Lord Cranborne (later Lord Salisbury) led the Great Eastern from 1868 to 1872.54 This trend towards respectability marked railway boards as a whole: a recent study of the composition of the board of the Great Western Railway by Geoffrey Channon has shown that the majority of board members came from families of high social standing, and that board members were recruited for the political connections and influence which they could bring to the business of the company.55 This transformation was noted by Walter Besant and James Rice in their 1876 novel The Golden Butterfly: The new man thirty years ago [that is, at the height of the railway mania] was loud, ostentatious, and vulgar. The new man now - there are a great many more of them - is very often quiet, unpretending, and 53 For comment on banking fraud, see Punch, xxxii (1857), 49, 117, 133, 152-3; ibid., xxxiii (1857), 17, 23.

He understands Art, and is a patron; he enjoys the advan- tages which his wealth affords him; he knows how to bear his riches with dignity and with reserve.56 Accordingly, representations of railway directors shifted: the 'respectable' director came to symbolize railway enterprise after mid century, and the railway rogue disappeared altogether. But satirists saw it as their job to prick this respectability, which they believed to be undeserved. Take, for example, the cartoon of a generic railway director from Diogenes in 1854 (Plate 4). The influence of Hudson is immediately apparent: the director is fat, pompous and complacent. But, unlike Hudson, he is also respectable. There are no signs of shabbiness here, nor is it sug- gested that he is enjoying a brief prominence before reverting to a career of road-sweeping or vagabondage. His wealth is not a bubble; rather, this is a man of financial stability, who literally stands on his reputation of financial rectitude: beneath his feet is his ledger. Nevertheless, his respectability is presented as a sham, not because of his treatment of investors, but of passengers. He is surrounded by the imagery of railway accidents: at the top of the illustration is a depiction of a head-on collision. A surgeon's sign also features prominently, as does a notice of 'ANOTHER FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT', and a hospital's contribution box. In such cartoons, the 'public' the magazines were defending con- sisted of maltreated passengers rather than the defrauded share- holders who had proliferated in the cartoons of the 1840s. This was undoubtedly a response to the dramatic rise in this period of passenger traffic, which increased more than three- fold between 1845 and 1855.57 That the readers of the satirical press were among these passengers is confirmed by the growing number of cartoons set in railway carriages and on railway plat- forms: the editorial assumption was that most readers would be familiar with these environs.58 Indeed, the magazines fre- quently featured comment on their readers' railway grievances, most of which will be recognizable to twenty-first-century rail 56 Walter Besant and James Rice, The Golden Butterfly (1876; London, n.d.), 88-9. 57 Kostal, Law and English Railway Capitalism, 281. 58Many of the jokes appearing on the pages of the satirical press assumed a detailed knowledge of the railway experience on the part of the reader. For example, in 1846 Mephystopheles joked that criminals should be punished by being made to travel third-class upon the Great Western Railway, and in severe cases be made to 'drink daily a basin of scalding soup at the Wolverton Station': Mephystopheles, i (1845-6), 119.</page><page sequence="18">128 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 189 ( 1I ?

The low quality of accommodation, particularly second and third class, and the discomfort of train journeys were often discussed.

If the pages of the satirical press are to be believed, rail travel was becoming an increasingly bloody affair. There was some truth in this. The average number of passengers killed on the railways per year rose from 20 in 1845-9 to 42 in 1865-9. The number of reported injuries was also rising, from 280 per year between 1850 and 1854, to 658 between 1865 and 1869. But the number of accidents did not keep pace with the number of journeys undertaken. Passenger traffic increased from 30 mil- lion in 1845 to 111 million in 1855, while in 1865 the total was 239 million.63 London's roads ended many more lives than the rails, while disasters at sea could be destructive of life on a scale never achieved by the railways." But the raw figures conceal the frequent near-misses which did much to shape the percep- tion of railways as potential death-traps, and which led to a con- stant expectation of disaster.65 Many jokes in the satirical press were based on the fears that went through passengers' minds both before boarding the train and during the journey. One cartoon showed an undertaker touting for business on a railway platform, much to the alarm of a passenger about to board a 60Diogenes, iii (1854), 109. 61 Fun, new ser., vii (1868), 248. 62Punch, xix (1850), 171. 63Kostal, Law and English Railway Capitalism, 281. Figures gathered by the Board of Trade showed that railway employees rather than passengers were the primary victims of the railways. In the period 1845-70, on average 116 employees were killed every year. Even allowing for the fact that these figures underestimated the problem, for companies were not obliged by law to make returns, it is clear that it was far more dangerous to be an employee on the railways than a passenger.

The novelty of the technology and the great speeds involved made them seem so much more terrifying than more familiar and mundane routes to the grave. Furthermore, unlike other industrial-age disasters such as fac- tory or mining accidents, railways were capable of killing mem- bers of any class, which lent them a special fascination.68 Surprisingly, given popular perceptions of Punch's growing dislike of the working classes, the blame for accidents was rarely laid at the door of railway employees.69 Rather, it was argued that accidents were caused by the economy measures of greedy directors which compromised safety and placed passen- gers' lives at risk. The magazines were convinced that accidents were eminently preventable: they were not an inevitable feature of the railway system, but could be traced back to the directors, and their policies of profit maximization. Employees were over- worked and underpaid, and were driven to the use of stimu- lants as a substitute for sleep.70 This was inexcusable when it placed the lives of passengers at risk. Railway companies needed to be run as public institutions in the public interest, but commercially minded directors were failing to do this. Dio- genes wrote that it was one of the great fallacies of the day 'that railways are intended for public convenience, instead of being, as they undoubtedly are, mere mediums for the pleasantries of speculation, as well as a source of profit to the Directors'.71 Tomahawk claimed that 'In the eyes of most railway directors the public is a good-natured, doltish sort of dummy, created for the purpose of furnishing dividends and to be cozened in all sorts of ways'.72 In 1848 the Puppet-Show considered 'Railway 66Punch, xxiii (1852), 129. 67Ibid., 119. 68 Kostal, Law and English Railway Capitalism, 280. 69 The same was true elsewhere. See, for example, the comments of the Times on Edward Watkin's argument that 95 per cent of railway accidents were caused by the negligence of railway employees: Times, 31 Jan. 1874. 70 Punch, xlv (1863), 243; ibid., Ivii (1869), 219. 71 Diogenes, iii (1854), 109. 72 Tomahawk, iii (1868), 23.</page><page sequence="21">BUSINESS IN PICTURES 131 Directors, as a general rule, capable of anything'.73 Punch felt the same, and wrote in 1852 of boards of 'unscrupulous, avari- cious, dividend-grasping, screwing, bloated railway directors'.74 In 1856 the magazine thought that railway directors were losing 'all sense of decency in a hunger for lucre'.75 Criticisms of directors therefore borrowed freely from the language and imagery traditionally used to portray the short- comings of individual enterprise. The complacent, immoral greed of railway directors closely resembled the penny-pinching adulteration practised by small tradesmen, the extensive use made of sweated labour in the tailoring trade, and the naked avarice of large capitalists, all regular themes in the satirical press.76 But the parallel was imperfect, for railways were joint- stock enterprises in which ownership and control were divorced: while directors owned shares in the companies they managed, these usually represented a tiny fraction of the total. The shareholders delegated to the directors the task of man- aging the business efficiently, which was judged in terms of a regular and high dividend; when this fell, general meetings became uncomfortable affairs. If satirical representations of railway politics posited a conflict between the directorial inter- est on the one hand, and the public, or passenger, interest on the other, where did the shareholders fit into this picture?77 The speculative shareholder who bought shares to make quick profits and had no intention of holding a stake in a company on a permanent basis received little sympathy from the satirical press. The profusion of schemes promoted in the railway mania of the mid 1860s produced, as in 1845-7, a rich response in the satiri- cal magazines.78 Greed, as before, was roundly condemned; speculators were urged to renounce the vision of large profits 73Puppet-Show, i (1848), 179. 74 Punch, xxiii (1852), 207. 75 Ibid., xxx (1856), 180. 76Ibid., v (1843), 48-9; ibid., viii (1845), 3; ibid., xxix (1855), 47; ibid., xxxv (1858), 207.

In 1867 Judy published 'The Railway Shareholder's Dirge', which ends with the said investor rejecting the promises of directors: I no more will prove confiding, All their snares I'll flee; And by Three per Cents abiding Satisfied I'll be.79 The same year, Tomahawk published an allegory against specu- lation, in which a speculator, tempted by the promise of limited liability, falls 'headlong into the abyss - among flames and utter ruin! . . . he went on falling and falling through the most dreadful horrors until he reached his grave! And when he reached his grave - still he fell!'80 Cartoons about the 1840s mania presented shareholders as gullible victims of company pro- moters, guilty at best of naivety, and at worst of reckless greed for wealth; the same was true of cartoons of the 1860s. 'The Road to Ruin', a cartoon published in Fun in 1867, could just as easily have appeared in 1847. It depicted the mania as a train, marked 'SPECULATION', disappearing into the ether.81 In the carriages of the train were a number of disreputable- looking joint-stock company promoters busily blowing bubbles which gullible members of the public, including one in a fool's cap, were desperately eager to catch. What had changed was that this kind of speculator was becoming less representative in Victorian discourse of the 'average' railway shareholder. The railway industry had always been keen to attract long-term investors; as long ago as 1840 the Railway Times endeavoured to present railway shares as something more than 'mere speculations': they were 'real and valuable investments in the soil'.82 But as the Times remarked, it was difficult to entice cautious investors when railway shares fluctuated so dramatically in value.83 When the railway share market stabilized in the 1850s, however, a large number of steady investors, the type who traditionally invested in consols, were encouraged to take an interest in railway securities, with the result that holding shares in railways gained a respectability 79Judy, i (1867), 185.

As a result, it was difficult to know where to accommodate them in concep- tualizations of railway politics. Were they, like passengers, the helpless victims of tyrannical boards, or were their demands for high dividends the reason for directors' economy-mindedness? It is possible to imagine an interpretation of railway politics based on the latter view, which would have posited a conflict between companies on the one hand, and a public cleansed of shareholders on the other. Very occasionally, the view that there was a fundamental clash of interest between shareholders and passengers did creep to the surface in the satirical press. Diogenes commented scornfully: Can the groans of the wounded compare With cheers from shareholders pleased? Who cares for accident When he gets six per cent.?87 But such thoughts were rarely voiced, for it was far more typi- cal to portray shareholders as the victims, rather than the allies, 84 For an exploration of Victorian perceptions of the differences between 'specu- lation' and 'investment', see David C.

This may have been a calculated editorial decision. While it is probably doubtful whether Spencer's maiden ladies and clergymen ever took Punch, the satirical press was read chiefly by metropolitan types with a surplus income to invest, the very people who were beginning to take an interest in railways. So it is probably no coincidence that from the late 1850s and early 1860s there emerged a growing sympathy in the satirical press for the 'poor shareholders', the prey of greedy or incompetent directors and scheming company lawyers.88 Several spoof reports of general meetings dramatized the tensions and divisions between boards and their sharehold- ers: the latter, eager to vent their frustration at the wasteful and extravagant policies of their directors, hurl abuse at them, and pelt them with anything that comes to hand, from chairs to baked potatoes.89 The steady, rather than the speculative, shareholder also occasionally made his way into cartoons, as in the one from Fun shown in Plate 5. Here, a gang of railway directors is seen tak- ing coins from the money bag of John Bull, representing their shareholders, and flinging them away at various unsound exten- sion schemes. Bull sits blindfolded and passive, unaware of what is being done with his money. In the distance a train marked 'Inquiry' can be seen making its way towards the directors, soon to run them over. The cartoon is a comment on the affairs of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), which caused something of a sensation in 1867. When the company's dividend suddenly collapsed, the shareholders insti- tuted a committee of inquiry to find out the cause. The com- mittee reported that since 1855 the directors had engaged in a misguided policy of expansion and counter-productive rivalry with neighbouring companies, and their new lines had been disastrously unprofitable. The board, concluded the report, had conducted the company's affairs 'with a reckless disregard to the shareholders' interests'.90 The shareholders insisted upon 88 Punch, xxxvii (1859), 209; ibid., xxxix (1860), 99. 89 Ibid., xxv (1853), 226; ibid., xxxiii (1857), 113; ibid., xxxvii (1859), 109.

By permission of the Centre for the Study of Cartoons and Caricature the reappointment of Samuel Laing, who had presided over an era of high dividends in the late 1840s and early 1850s, as the company's chairman. The cartoon dramatizes contemporary uncertainty over the role of shareholders in large companies. The shareholders are doubly represented, once by Bull, the helpless, passive investor, and again by the more dynamic engine in the distance, coming to wreak belated vengeance on the incompetent board of direc- tors. Were the shareholders to blame for not bringing the board to account much earlier? The directors were eager for the share- holders to bear part of the blame for what had happened, argu- ing that the shareholders had had every opportunity of apprising themselves of what the board was doing, but had remained indifferent provided the dividend remained steady.91 If Bull had 9 Ibid., 11 May 1867.</page><page sequence="26">136 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 189 removed his blindfold, the catastrophe could have been averted. But the cartoon does not censure the shareholders for their pas- sivity: it is perhaps significant that in their passive role, the shareholders are represented by Bull. Cruikshank had employed the iconography of John Bull in the 1840s, but in his cartoons Bull the shareholder, though a victim, was undoubtedly a guilty victim: a speculator who had come unstuck and was paying the price for his greed.92 In Fun's cartoon, by contrast, Bull is not a rapacious speculator, but an honest and simple investor, victim- ized not as so often in the past by the corrupt state, but by cor- rupt companies. Miles Taylor has argued convincingly that representations of John Bull as a victim of the state's fiscal poli- cies had been on the wane since the 1830s and 1840s, after the fracture of pre-Reform Act definitions of the 'people', and after the reforms of Peel and Gladstone. But this cartoon indicates that the image of a beleaguered Bull could still be employed to demonstrate Englishmen's victimization by joint-stock com- panies.93 The parallels between shareholders and directors on the one hand and voters and governments on the other were perhaps too strong for the Liberal-inclined Fun to resist, espe- cially in the year of the second Reform Act. In this view, then, shareholders ranked alongside passengers as part of the public which was exploited by railway boards, rather than alongside the directors as exploiters of passengers. In effect, the role of shareholders was depoliticized: their inter- est in maximizing dividends was effaced; their inability to con- trol boards was viewed not as the result of carelessness, but as evidence of their impotence in the face of over-mighty directors. The limits of such an approach in making sense of joint-stock politics were demonstrated in 1868 by another cartoon in Fun, in which the affairs of the LB&amp;SCR were again prominent (Plate 6). The cartoon is a response to the announcement by the 'Southern Confederation' of railway companies (the LB&amp;SCR, the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway) of fare increases. Laing of the LB&amp;SCR and Edward Watkin of the South Eastern Railway are depicted riding 92See 'Railway Calls', 'Mr. John Bull' and 'The Railway Dragon', in George Cruikshank's Table-Book, i (1845), facing pp. 237, 239, 261. 93 Miles Taylor, 'John Bull and the Iconography of Public Opinion in England c.1712-1929', Past and Present, no. 134 (Feb. 1992).</page><page sequence="27">BUSINESS IN PICTURES 137 .j.c %P -- h ..

Laing takes centre stage in the cartoon, but nowhere, either in the cartoon itself or in the accompanying text, do we get the sense that the fare increases were implemented in an attempt to restore the</page><page sequence="28">138 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 189 deflated dividends of the railway companies concerned. Laing, as already noted, was installed by the shareholders specifically with this objective, and these policies were the natural result. But the shareholders are invisible and unremarked upon. Rather than finding new ways of representing the complex and sometimes contradictory political realities of big business, Victorian satirists relied upon tried and tested formulations, chiefly the paradigm of 'Old Corruption'. While its political relevance was fading as a result of the fiscal policies of mid Victorian governments, 'Old Corruption' took on a new lease of life as a means of understanding and criticizing directorial greed, incompetence and wastefulness. If railway directors could be likened to cheating tradesmen, the flexibility of satiri- cal invective meant that they could also be portrayed as man- aging corrupt, monopolistic corporations no different from institutions such as the Bank of England and the East India Company. The cartoon of Laing and Watkin is a good example, reflecting as it does the belief that powerful and privi- leged railway companies were 'taxing' the public through unjust charges. In the accompanying article, Fun defined the increase as 'an additional shilling of income-tax on every man with a hundred a-year, travelling third-class to his daily work'. This tax went not to ameliorate the working conditions of railway employees, nor to improve train speeds or carriages (or even to boost the dividend), but to fund the foolish extrava- gances of the board, such as the gold leaf laid on the railings at Ludgate Hill by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The directors were leeches who 'suck the blood of the public'.94 Shareholders were every bit as aggrieved at the profligacy of their directors: a Great Western proprietor complained that his directors were spending ?50,000 'on building an inn, with two pagodas on the top of it', when the company was paying 'a shabby four per cent'.95 'Ordinary' shareholders increasingly came to be seen (and saw themselves) as the victims of dir- ectors who, to fund extravagant expansion plans, issued pref- erence stock and debentures, thus creating new interest groups which were first in line when company profits were 94 Fun, new ser., vii (1868), 248. 95Letter to Times, 24 Aug. 1852.</page><page sequence="29">BUSINESS IN PICTURES 139 distributed.96 The perceived extravagance of railway directors therefore united shareholders and passengers against a com- mon foe, enabling the Times to define directors as 'persons whose pecuniary interest has entirely severed them from the rest of the community'.97 Railway 'potentates' such as Watkin incurred the wrath of shareholders and passengers alike with their preference for self-aggrandizing and headline-catching schemes over more modest but profitable and useful ven- tures.98 Watkin, for example, planned among other things a railway to connect Manchester and Paris (via a Channel tunnel), a Dublin-Galway ship canal and an imitation of the Eiffel Tower at Wembley.99 Just as old corporations were attacked for their political con- nections, so were railway companies perceived as inherently corrupt because of their strength in Parliament. The 'dragon- nades' cartoon in Fun was 'Dedicated to "Liberal"-minded Directors', a barbed reminder that both Laing and Watkin were Liberal MPs. They were far from unique. By 1868 the 'railway interest' numbered 125 MPs,100 and it was tempting for con- temporaries to conclude that this was the reason for Parlia- ment's unwillingness to tackle the behaviour of railway companies. Such views were reflected in the cartoon by John Tenniel published in Punch shortly after the passage of the Railway Regulation Act, which, critics believed, made no ser- ious attempt to curb railway abuses (Plate 7). Here, Tenniel depicts Dick Turpin riding up alongside an engine, which is straddled by a railway director, who gloats: 'You were hanged! We rob by Act of Parliament!!!' For the magazines, the solution was simple: never vote for parliamentary candidates who had railway interests. 'Voting for a railway-man is like voting for a robber', reasoned Punch.101 In 1864 it had declared that there was no chance that Parliament would defend the interests of the public against the railway companies: 'One might as well 96 Alborn, Conceiving Companies, 202-5. 97 Times, 4 Oct. 1852. 98 Alborn, Conceiving Companies, ch. 8. 99 Harold Perkin, The Age of the Railway (London, 1970), 193; David Hodgkins, The Second Railway King: The Life and Times of Sir Edward Watkin, 1819-1901 (Cardiff, 2002). 100 Geoffrey Alderman, The Railway Interest (Leicester, 1973), 232.

'Railway Sleepers', a cartoon in Fun, showed a group of dir- ectors slumped in their chairs in the boardroom, snoozing while passengers were maimed and killed.104 This reflected the common view of railway directorships that 'The pay is heavy, and the work is light'.105 The parallels with contemporaneous representations of the older corporations were obvious. The language used to describe the East India Company directors in the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny gives sufficient flavour: the 'sleepy senselessness' of the directors had caused the crisis; they had been 'caught napping in [their] easy chairs'.106 It became increasingly common to portray directors as 'guinea pigs' who performed no particular function, but reaped generous rewards merely by attending board meetings and pocketing their fees. This was stretching reality a little: the directors of as large a concern as the Great Western Railway were being paid an aver- age of just ?362 by the end of the nineteenth century.107 These salaries were not on the scale of the huge pay awards given to 'fat cat' directors which have been so controversial since the 1990s. And while chairmen could expect much higher pay, this was a reward for sustained attention to company affairs, and the recipients could not be termed guinea pigs. But the issue of pay was another means of playing up the irreconcilable differ- ences between shareholders and their boards, thus positioning the shareholders on the side of the exploited public. 102 Ibid., xlvi (1864), 63. 103 Ibid., Iv (1868), 98. 104 Fun, new ser., i (1865), 55. 105 Anon., The Railway Meeting: A Satire Dedicated to the Pillaged and Plundered Shareholders of Great Britain by a Lancashire Victim (London, 1856), 18. 106 Punch, xxxiii (1857), 64-5.

Shareholders were unable to impose any restraints on their behaviour, while their strength in Parliament rendered attempts at regulation toothless. For some, the solution was the private lawsuit, which would oblige companies to pay large compensation payments to victims of rail accidents. Such payments were beginning to hit companies from the early 1850s, and by the mid 1860s they were paying over ?300,000 annually in compensation to accident victims, to which sub- stantial legal costs had to be added. 108 These payments, though small in the context of the total revenue of the companies, did act as a drain on company profits.109 Satirical magazines generally approved of these actions: Punch suspected that those lines which had just made a substantial payout were the safest to travel on, and believed that if heavy damages were consistently awarded, companies would be forced to change their policies.110 But there was a widespread feeling among the satirists that legal actions were ultimately ineffectual because the directors were left unscathed by them: payments hit the companies rather than the directors, who were never made to pay personally for the accidents they caused."' More than financial retribution, however, the press demanded physical retribution. The fact that directors damaged the bodies of passengers but did not suffer any injury in return was galling in an age in which evangelical ideas of retributive justice still had much influence. The common refrain was that the 'immaculate directors',112 the 'impeccable directors',113 were never held legally or morally responsible for the accidents on their lines: they continued collecting their pay and mixing in high society while their passengers suffered. The lack of personal accountability of the members of railway boards, and the arrogance that this was thought to breed, led to tremendous frustration which exploded 10s Kostal, Law and English Railway Capitalism, 305-6. 109 However, companies were largely spared the extra burden of compensating injured and killed employees and their families, owing to the courts' narrow inter- pretation of the vicarious liability of corporate employers, an issue rarely addressed by the periodicals: ibid., ch. 7. 110 Punch, xxi (1851), 66; ibid., xlv (1863), 92.

In 1854 Diogenes longed 'To kick a director, / Or railway projector'.114 Better still, it was argued, would be to place directors in the same position of danger in which they placed their passengers. Several cartoons showed directors strapped to the front of their trains: it was argued that, if this were done, accidents would be eradicated instantly.115 By the 1860s the magazines were proposing even more brutal measures. Fun's verse 'The Perfect Cure', written by 'A Suf- ferer', posited the ultimate solution: Directors - aye, guinea-pigs, all of the lot - Let's make of the tribe, mob, conspiracy, sect, or Whatever you call 'em examples: why not? Let us hang a Director - yes, hang a Director!116 Such an explosion of violence was not confined to the satirical press. The same views were expressed in City and Suburb, a novel of 1861 by the popular author Mrs Riddell. The hero, Alan Ruthven, a well-bred but poor inventor, attempts to sell a device which makes rail travel safer to a string of railway companies, who all reject his invention. After a particularly bad rail accident, a bitter Ruthven reflects 'that if on the occasion of every railway accident a director were hung, the directors either drawing lots or taking it in rotation, there would soon be none but unavoidable accidents'."11 Even the Times was compelled to admit that 'a succession of acci- dents to directors' would result in safer rail travel.118 III The mode of representing big business fashioned by the satiri- cal press from the 1840s proved to be remarkably versatile. The fat, complacent, well-dressed joint-stock bank director appeared frequently in the aftermath of the banking scandals of 1856-8; gas and water monopolies were presented as brutal, destructive monsters; ruined shareholders increasingly 114 Diogenes, iii (1854), 63. 115 For two large cartoons on this theme, see Punch, xxiv (1853), 125; ibid., xxxiii (1857), 25.

Into the 1870s, Punch continued to focus on the incompetent director (rotund and smug as ever) as the cause of railway accidents.120 Simmons argued that the passion of these representations cooled towards the end of the nine- teenth century, with Tenniel, responsible for many railway car- toons, turning away from the subject in the final years of his career.121 But other publications and other satirists were will- ing to take up the theme, employing identical imagery to make identical points. In the early twentieth century, for example, W. K. Haselden drew many cartoons for the Daily Mirror in which affluent, self-satisfied, incompetent directors, over-fond of extravagance and entirely unconcerned with even the basic needs of their passengers, were presented as the prime authors of accidents.122 More strikingly still, satirical treatments of the railways since privatization in the 1990s have also borrowed heavily from the visual language established in the second and third quarters of the nineteenth century. These cartoons con- vey the idea that directorial greed and complacency are the cause of accidents, and that entrepreneurs are drawn to the industry in order to extract as much cash from it as possible.'23 The feline aspect of the 'fat cat' imagery may be novel, but the presentation of directors as corpulent, complacent and in league with politicians in their plot to fleece the public is cer- tainly not.124 Shareholders, as in the nineteenth century, are largely invisible, and when seen, are depicted groaning under the burden of their wasteful and greedy directors.125 The l"9For cartoons on joint-stock bankers, see Town Talk, i (1858), 55, 79, 322, and also the Christmas Supplement to Town Talk (1858), 1-8; for cartoons on gas and water monopolies, see Hornet, vii (1873), 8, and also the cartoon 'The Mono- polies', from Funny Folks (1879), reprinted in Freeman, Railways and the Victorian Imagination, 106; for cartoons expressing sympathy for defrauded shareholders, see Punch, Ivi (1869), 48-9; Will-o'-the-Wisp, i (1868-9), 253-5. 120 Punch, lxvii (1874), 129. 121 Simmons, 'Powerful Critic of Railways', 155; but see Punch, ci (1891), 55, for a striking exception. 122Daily Mirror, 8 Dec. 1905; ibid., 23 Oct. 1907; ibid., 9 Nov. 1907; ibid., 29 Nov. 1919. 123 Guardian, 26 Feb. 1997; ibid., 6 June 1997; Sunday Telegraph, 8 Mar. 1998; Independent, 11 Oct. 1999. 124 Independent, 5 Aug. 1996; Guardian, 30 Aug. 1996; ibid., 6 Feb. 1997. 125 Glasgow Herald, 13 Aug. 1998.</page><page sequence="35">BUSINESS IN PICTURES 145 anthropomorphic railway of 150 years ago even makes an occa- sional reappearance.'26 The resilience of this mode of representation is perhaps a weakness as well as a strength. It indicates that the populist message resonated and continues to resonate with many mem- bers of the public. But it is also in some senses an unchallen- ging view of the politics of the large corporation: to set up the directors as the scapegoats for all the ills of the industry absolved shareholders from any blame, either for permitting directors to behave irresponsibly or negligently, or for their greed in demanding dividends which the lines could not sup- port without dangerous economies and excessive fare hikes. Nor, it seems, was it a mode of representation which ever had the desired effect of discomfiting directors: Simmons recounted that in all his research he never once came across any evidence in letters, diaries, memoirs or the railway press that directors ever paid any attention to the satirists' barbs.'27 Nevertheless, the images and ideas Victorians selected in order to represent railways should not be discounted as marginal to the historian's task of understanding the development of joint-stock politics. Above all, this visual vocabulary gives us a view, corroborated by other sources, of a Victorian public reluctant to embrace big business, not because of its novelty, but because of its familiarity. Rather than presenting companies as modem, dynamic, enter- prising entities, satirists stressed those aspects of their behav- iour which made them seem analogous to corrupt corporations: their extravagance, their political connections, their lack of accountability. The success of this mode of representation doomed British business to grow up in the shadow of its controversial and corrupt ancestors.
