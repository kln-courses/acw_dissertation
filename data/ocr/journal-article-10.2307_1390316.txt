<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSUMERISM AND ECOLOGY Ecological Consciousness and the Symbol "God"1 Gordon D. Kaufman Harvard University I am a Christian theologian. This does not mean, however, that I understand my work as being essentially a matter of explaining and defending Christian faith and the Christian set of symbols for interpreting human life and the world. The task of the Christian theologian is rather, as I understand it, to scrutinize carefully, critically evaluate, and reconstruct (in whatever ways seem appropriate and necessary) the cen- tral Christian symbols, so they will encourage and support a faith and life appropri- ate for today.2 In our time it is no longer sufficient for theologians simply to take it for granted that the basic structure and commitments of traditional Christian faith are-in all of their main lines -right and proper; and to proceed, then, to expound and reinterpret them in whatever ways seem intelligible and persuasive. Whatever may have been the value and justification of this sort of theologizing in the past, the crises of the twentieth century (to many of which Christian symbols, institutions, and practices have themselves contributed) have made it clear that thorough reassessment of the traditional Christian symbol-system, with an eye to its (possibly drastic) recon- struction or even to the total rejection of some of its principal features, is required- if it is to continue to contribute to human well-being, and to the well-being of the rest of life, on planet Earth. It is with this thoroughly critical and open understand- ing of the task of Christian theologians today that this contribution to our Buddhist- Christian dialogue has been prepared. And I hope a similar spirit will animate the responses to this paper, whether offered from the Christian or the Buddhist side of our conversation. I My assignment here is to examine the topic of "Christianity and Ecology." This is, of course, a very broad topic, much too large for a paper of this sort. I have taken the liberty, therefore, to confine my discussion to only one of the many questions that might be considered under this heading. The central symbol in terms of which Christian faith and Christian life (as well as most other western religious traditions) understand and order themselves is God, usually thought of as designating the cre- ator and governor of the world, the only One to whom unqualified devotion, love, Buddhist-Christian Studies 20 (2000). ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

If we can come to some understanding of how this symbol has functioned in the past, and might be conceived properly to function today with respect to ecological concerns, we will have made a large step toward understanding the overall topic of Christianity and ecology. I am devoting this paper, therefore, to the question of "Ecological Consciousness and the Symbol 'God."' Throughout my professional life I have been concerned with the problem of the continuing viability (or lack of viability) in our contemporary world of the symbol "God," as that symbol has been understood through most of western history (not only by Christians and Jews, but also by many humanists and secularists). And for the last thirty years or so, I have been reflecting on the issues which our growing eco- logical consciousness poses for our understanding of-and our ordering of life in terms of-this symbol. My earliest writing directly concerned with this question is in a paper entitled "The Concept of Nature: A Problem for Theology" published in the Harvard Theological Review in 1972.3 In that paper I attempted to show that there is a fundamental tension-indeed, a conceptual and logical incompatibility- between, on the one hand, the understanding of God, and of the intimate relation of humanity to God (as seen in our western religious and philosophical traditions), and on the other hand, our growing awareness that human existence is essentially constituted by, and could not exist apart from, the complex ecological ordering of life that has evolved on planet Earth over many millennia.4 The main emphasis in that paper remains largely correct in my view. Hence, I would like to begin my remarks here by summarizing some portions of its argument. This will set the stage for the remainder of my presentation which will be devoted to sketching briefly the (perhaps somewhat drastic) reconception of the symbol "God," and of the human relation to God, that appears to me to be required now, if Christians (as well as others who seek to order their lives in relation to God) are to come to terms with our current ecological consciousness and knowledge. II My intention in this paper of twenty-five years ago was not to develop a Christian ecological theology, but rather to examine carefully the concept of nature that had emerged in the course of western history and had-particularly with the growing importance of the natural sciences in modernity-become central to Westerners' understanding of themselves and of the world in which they live. A major conclu- sion to which the article came was the following: The very ideas of God and humanity, as they have gradually been worked out over millennia (in the West), are so framed as to blur or even conceal our embedded- ness in the natural order as we now are increasingly conceiving it. The great religious struggle between Israel and Canaan was over the question of the metaphysical importance of naturalpower andprocess on the one hand and personal moral will on the other. When Yahweh won that struggle it meant that the object of ultimate loy- alty and devotion for humans in the West would be conceived increasingly in terms of models rooted in our moral andpersonal experience, not in our sense of depen-</page><page sequence="3">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" dence upon and unity with the orders and processes of nature. Thus the very con- cept of God itself-as that concept has developed in the West-has built into it a depreciation of the metaphysical, and certainly the religious, significance of nature (226; emphasis added). Let me sketch briefly the argument supporting this claim. The symbol "God"-not "nature"-has functioned during most of Western ref- erence in terms of which all human life, indeed all reality, is to be understood. God was believed to be the creator of the heavens and the earth (as Genesis 1 puts it), the creator of "all things visible and invisible" (as declared in some of the creeds), the lord of the world. It was, therefore, in terms of God's purposes and God's acts that human existence and life-indeed, all of reality-were to be understood. The model in terms of which God, from the biblical texts on, has been understood was basically anthropomorphic: God was seen as essentially an agent, an actor, one who is doing things, a God Who Acts.5 And human existence was to be oriented most fundamen- tally on this transworldly reality God, not on anything in the world, or indeed on the world (the natural order) itself. For humans to orient themselves and their lives on anything other than God was deemed idolatry-a turning away from the very source and ground of humanity's being and life, and a direct violation of God's will for humankind. Hence when, as in modernity/postmodernity, the context and ground of human life is increasingly thought of in evolutionary and ecological terms, nature became a direct rival of God for human attention and devotion. Profound interest in and attention to nature, to the natural orders within which human life transpires, were not, of course, an invention of modernity; their roots go back (in the West) to Greek culture. But the reappearance of this interest in early modernity led to a direct conflict with God's claims to absolute loyalty. God was seen as a powerful agent who acted everywhere in the world in freedom and with intentionality and love. This conception was based on a model drawn from the human experience of freedom and creativity, purposiveness and agency-partic- ularly as experienced by male members of the patriarchal society within which it became an important emphasis; God was from early on thought of almost exclu- sively in male-gendered terms. For many centuries nature and God were not in any sort of significant tension with each other, since what we today speak of as "nature" was thought of as God's creation-the finite order-in every respect a product of God's creative activity and at all points completely at God's sovereign disposal. (The concept of nature, at least as we think of it today, had no real place in the biblical story at all.)6 It is, rather, Yahweh and Israel, God and humanity-or even, as in the later individualism of much of Western Christendom, God and the soul (Augustine) -that are the realities of central interest and concern (in traditional ways of read- ing biblical texts). Though humanity may be created out of the "dust from the ground" (Gen. 2:7) and could not exist apart from the context provided by heaven and earth and the multitude of other living creatures on the earth (Gen. 1), it is clearly the climax of God's creative activity. Created in God's own image (Gen. 1:27), human beings are the ones for whom all things were made and they must be subject to God's will (Gen. 1:28-29; 2:18-20, 15). Humankind, moreover, is the (only)</page><page sequence="4">GORDON D. KAUFMAN creature in which God himself becomes incarnate . . . the divine-human relation is clearly the axis around which all else revolves. In the end when God creates "new heavens and a new earth" (Isa. 65:17; Rev. 21:1) . . . this is primarily for the sake of the "new Jerusalem" where ... all human suffering, pain, and misery will be over- come (Isa. 65:18-24; Rev. 21:2-4) .... The rest of creation, though always recog- nized and sometimes acknowledged and even reflected upon, simply was not of cen- tral theological interest or importance, and (with the exception of the angels) never became the subject of any technical theological vocabulary or doctrines (221f).7 When, then, with Giordano Bruno and others, nature began to be thought of as itself infinite, a concept directly in conflict with that of (the infinite) God-and with God's unique metaphysical and religious roles-was emerging. In due course God and nature were explicitly identifiedwith each other (e.g., by Spinoza)-it not being possible to conceive of two infinites; and it was under the aegis of the concept of nature (i.e., of natural process) that the identification was made, not the concept of God (i.e., of a free agent). What had been two ontologically distinct realities (God and creation) ordered toward each other in a very specific and distinctive way, so as to preserve the ulti- mate reality and importance of God, now became one reality (nature) viewed under two different aspects (natura naturans and natura naturata). And God no longer had an unusurpable place in humanity's understanding of itself and of the context within which human life falls; indeed, it is not clear that God any longer had (could be con- ceived to have) any distinctive place at all (p. 219).8 The concept of nature was becoming the central metaphysical concept; nature was displacing God as the all-encompassing reality. In modernity, it seems, nature and God have become rivals in the claims they make on our interest, attention, commitment, and loyalty. Thinking of the ultimate reality with which we humans have to do in largely ecological terms, that is in terms of the interconnected and interdependent powers and processes of nature-instead of in such more traditional religious terms as, for example, our "heavenly Father" whose children we are, or the "Lord" of the universe whose loyal subjects we seek to be-leads to sharply different understandings of who or what we humans are and how we ought to live. (More will be said about this later.) This is not to say, of course, that all who today use the word "nature," or who are engaged in ecological cam- paigns, regard themselves as committed to naturalism as a philosophy/religion. Most English speakers are probably unaware of the metaphysical implications and ten- dencies I am pointing out here, and might well disavow them if they were called to their attention; and they continue to think of God as in some (vague) sense "creator and lord of the world" and thus sovereign over the natural order-though if asked to specify how this notion can be understood in light of contemporary scientific cos- mological thinking, they would find themselves hard-pressed to give a clear answer. But this continuing use of the traditional symbol "God" in a largely uncritical way tends (as suggested above) to "blur or even conceal our embeddedness in the natural order as we now are increasingly conceiving it." To the extent that we today take our experience of "natural" powers and processes as paradigmatic of the ultimate reality</page><page sequence="5">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" with which we have to do-rather than the distinctively human activities and expe- riences of choosing, setting purposes, willing, thinking, creating, speaking, making covenants, and the like (which had provided principal models for constructing the traditional symbol "God")-we will inevitably think of the world in which we live, and our human place within it, in terms quite different from those presented by Western religious traditions. This brings us to the second theme from that early essay which I wish to discuss: the implications, for our human self-understanding, of giving the modern concept of nature the paradigmatic significance which I claim it has come to have for most Western life and experience. As sketched in that earlier paper, the concept of nature appears very rich and comprehensive but at the same time ambiguous, particularly in what it implies about our human place in the natural order-one of the central issues posed by modern ecological consciousness. Are we humans to regard ourselves as simply a part of nature, shaped and determined in all important respects by the ecological order within which we have emerged and continue to be sustained? Or, in view of (a) our ability to make nature itself an object of our experience and reflec- tion-a reality thus in some sense over against us, and (b) our ability to deliberately transform in very radical ways (through our humanly created technologies) many of the natural patterns and orders found on planet Earth, must we be understood as, in certain significant respects, transcending these natural orders and patterns? This is a deeper problem than is often noted, and unless we find a way to address it, we will set our course in the current ecological crisis in terms of a self-understanding (as human beings) that is thoroughly confused. Let us sharpen this issue a bit further. On the one hand, so far as nature is thought of as including all powers and processes in the world, humans seem to be included entirely within it. To see humanity in this way as fundamentally and perhaps totally a part of nature is the direction in which we are being pushed by many currents in contemporary sci- ence and culture. Human existence is a moment in a complex ecological balance without which it could not exist and to which it contributes. This ecological system is the presupposition of every dimension of our life; . . . and it is, in a real sense, the source and basis of our existence (p. 213). On the basis of this sort of understanding of human life within nature, an indict- ment is often brought against modern Western civilization: In our attempts to gain technological mastery of our world and of the ills that afflict humankind, we ... have ... so polluted our environment and upset the delicate balances which sustain life here on earth as to be destroying our- selves. We must control the population explosion; ... clean up our rivers and atmosphere; . . . stop [using] up resources at exponentially growing rates; . .. set aside and preserve those few remaining pieces of "natural" wilderness . .. [and so on]; in short, we must stop our wanton destruction of nature. (p. 214) This indictment- on the other hand-actually stands in a kind of deep contra- diction with the premise (respecting our human immersion in the natural ecological</page><page sequence="6">GORDON D. KAUFMAN order) on which it may be thought to be based. For it straightforwardly declares that humans have done much to and with the order of nature and that they can do some- thing now to help restore the balance which in their ignorance and rapacity they have disrupted ... humans are not [then] ... simply a part of nature, one more function of the processes and powers that make up the natural world[;] ... they stand in some sense apart from all these and can and do work on them and transform them. It is through human artifice, human culture, that the present ecological crisis has been brought upon us, and (it is hoped) through a further and more sophisticated appli- cation of that same artifice the crisis may eventually be abated. Insofar as "nature" here is viewed as distinct from the "artificial" activities of human beings which mod- ify it and use it for raw material in the creation of culture, it is obvious that nature cannot be understood simply as that system which includes all powers and processes in the universe. Nature and culture are set over against each other in polar relation, and humanity is somehow in both, as both are in us humans (pp. 214f). What are the roots of this ambiguity-indeed, contradiction-in our Western understanding of ourselves within the natural order? We Westerners, who through- out the modern period have been reorienting our activities and our thinking in increasingly naturalistic terms, gained our basic formation and understanding of ourselves as active creative agents in living relation with the God who was regarded as creator of the heavens and the earth, a God in whose "image" we had been cre- ated. We thought of ourselves, thus, as significantly distinct from and "above" all the other creatures: indeed, we had been given-by God-a mandate to "subdue" the earth and to have "dominion" over all the other creatures (Gen. 1:28f; Ps. 8:5-8). We were, thus, creatures with a measure of active control over our own lives and des- tinies, creatures with a relation to the active creator of the heavens and the earth unmatched by any others. As technologies enabling dramatic transformations of the natural order increasingly appeared in the modern period, and as a new and much more powerful knowledge of what was believed to be the true order of nature began to emerge in the science of Galileo, Newton, and their successors, is it so surprising that Westerners came to think of themselves as "lords of creation" with the possibil- ity, and a mandate, to expand human powers over nature (as well as over the rest of humankind) in an almost unlimited way? With the secularization of the West, and the enormous growth of modern tech- nologies and sciences, we today think of ourselves in this double-but incoherent- way: we are products of the natural order here on earth, subject to the ecological bal- ances that have made all life (including our own) possible, and which are necessary for its continuance, but we are also able to understand this in and through our sci- ences, and we remain free enough of the orders surrounding and sustaining us, and creative enough, to bring into being new possibilities in the way human existence is ordered on planet Earth, and to change our ways of living that have become counter- productive, indeed destructive of ongoing human life. No other living beings of which we are aware have this double relation to the natural order: being its prod- ucts, but at the same time transcending it sufficiently to be able to deliberately trans- form it in significant ways. In the course of history, we have in fact brought into the</page><page sequence="7">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" world a whole new order of relationships (and thus of reality)-the sociocultural order-which has become for us humans the primary context within which we live and in terms of which we understand ourselves and the cosmos which is our home. I do not intend in this paper to attempt to overcome this "doubleness" in our modern (secular) human self-understanding. I take it as a given with which theolo- gians (and others) today must work-a given that demands significantly new for- mulations of our conceptions of God and of humanity (as well as of our intricate relation to nature), formulations that come to terms with, and can help us more effectively address, the issues discussed in the preceding pages. Much of my work as a theologian the past twenty-five years has been directed to precisely these questions. The remainder of this paper will be devoted to sketching briefly the way in which I have come to think about these matters. III As we have seen, the anthropocentrism (indeed, androcentrism) of the traditional Christian understanding of humanity in relation to God-and the consequent anthropomorphism (more precisely, the andromorphism) of the traditional concep- tion of God itself-tend to obscure and dilute, in Christian theology, ecological ways of thinking about our human place in the world. Is it possible to develop an under- standing of God and humanity that overcomes these difficulties? I would like to pro- pose a way to address this problem. I shall introduce three concepts which, taken together, suggest a significantly different understanding of God, humanity, and their relationship to each other-an understanding coherent with our modern/postmod- ern evolutionary and ecological conceptions of the appearance and development of life on planet Earth (including the emergence of human historico-cultural existence within the ecology of life). First, I want to spell out briefly what I call a biohistorical understanding of human being. I will argue that the wide modern consensus (at least among many university- educated people) that humankind should be conceived as having emerged out of less complex forms of life in the course of evolutionary developments on planet Earth over many millennia-and that we could not exist apart from this living biological web that continues to nourish and sustain us-is (if taken without further qualifi- cation) too vague and general to provide adequate understanding of the sorts of beings that we humans are; it says nothing about the importance-within this evo- lutionary setting-of the uniquely historical features (as I shall call them) of our human existence. The natural order is, no doubt, the wider context within which human history has appeared. But it has been (as we shall see) especially through our historical sociocultural development over many millennia-not our biological evo- lution alone-that we humans have acquired many of our most distinctive, and sig- nificant, characteristics. Second, I want to call attention to what I call the "serendipitous creativity" man- ifest throughout the universe-that is, the coming into being through time of the new and the novel, whether this leads to what appear (from human and humane</page><page sequence="8">GORDON D. KAUFMAN perspectives) to be horrifying evils or great goods. I use the conception of "creativ- ity" here-rather than the traditional idea of"God the creator"-because it presents creation of the new as an ongoing activity or process in the world, and does not call forth an image of a kind of "cosmic person" standing outside the cosmos, manipu- lating it from without. In my view if we wish to continue using the word "God," we would do well to understand it as referring to this ongoing creativity manifest in the cosmos.9 Third, since the traditional idea of a powerful teleological movement underlying and ordering all cosmic and historical processes (God's purposive activity) has become so problematic in twentieth-century thinking about evolution and history, I propose to replace it with a more modest conception-a conception of what I call "directional movements" or "trajectories" that emerge spontaneously in the course of evolutionary and historical developments. This more open (even random) notion-of serendipitous creativity manifesting itself in evolutionary and historical trajectories of various sorts-fits in with, but amplifies in important ways, today's thinking about cosmic processes. It is a notion that can be used to interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the "big bang" onward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. This whole vast cosmic process, I suggest, displays (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity: the coming into being through time of new modes of reality. It is a process that has fre- quently produced much more than would have been expected, given previously pre- vailing circumstances, indeed, more than might have seemed possible-even mov- ing eventually, along one of its lines, into the creation of us human beings with our distinctive history and historicity. IV Why do I suggest that we characterize humans as biohistorical beings? I shall argue that human historical development over many millennia has been as indispensable to the creation of human beings (as we today think of them) as were the biological evolutionary developments that preceded (and also continued to accompany) the emergence of humankind on planet Earth. As one rather obvious example (among a number of others that could also be mentioned) consider the impact of the emergence and historical growth of human awareness of, and knowledge about, both the natural world in which we humans live and our own human constitutions and possibilities. Though taking strikingly differ- ent forms in the various cultures of which we are aware, these features in some form-are present in all. And in all cultures they have provided women and men with significant powers over their immediate environment as well as over themselves. In the cultures of modernity human knowledge has become increasingly compre- hensive and detailed, providing us with considerable control over the physical and biological (as well as sociocultural and psychological) conditions of our existence- control that goes far beyond that of any other animal. Indeed, we can say that we</page><page sequence="9">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" human beings, and the further course of human history, are no longer completely at the disposal of the natural order and the natural powers that brought us into being, in the way we were, say, ten millennia ago. It has been in the course of human his- tory, thus, that we humans have gained-especially in and through our various knowledge-some measure of transcendence over the nature of which we are part (as noted earlier in this paper); with our developing practices and skills, growing in modernity into enormously powerful technologies, we have utterly transformed the face of the earth and are beginning to push on into outer space. How should we understand-in connection with our evolutionary story-these features of our humanity that have emerged largely in human history? It appears to be qua our development into beings shaped in many respects by historico-cultural processes-that is, humanly created, not merely natural biological, processes-that we humans have gained these increasing measures of control over the natural order, as well as over the onward movement of history. In significant respects, thus, our his- toricity (as we may call it) is a distinctive mark of our humanness: we are beings shaped decisively by a history that has given us power ourselves to shape future his- tory in significant ways. On the one hand, in our transcendence of the natural order within which we emerged (through our creation of complex cultures), we humans, as we know ourselves today, appear to be radically different from any other living beings. On the other hand, in our "utter dependence" (to adopt a phrase of the nine- teenth-century theologian Schleiermacher) on the web of life from which and within which we emerged, we humans are at one with every other species. Developments in human history have been as indispensable a factor in bringing today's humanity into being as biological evolution, and have resulted in an actual in-building into our human nature itself (in the highly developed form in which we today are aware of ourselves) of culturally informed and shaped dimensions and processes. Even some biological aspects of the organism that finally emerged as human are, as the anthropologist Clifford Geertz has pointed out, "both a cultural and a biological product,"10 and our present biological organisms, if left simply to themselves, would be so seriously deficient that they could not function. As Geertz sums up the matter: We are ... incomplete or unfinished animals who complete or finish ourselves through culture-and not through culture in general but through highly par- ticular forms of it: Dobuan and Javanese, Hopi and Italian, upper-class, aca- demic and commercial.11 The development of human enculturedness (and the consequent growth of human symbolic behavior) appears to have had particularly strong effects on the evolution of the brain.12 So we can say that the growth of cultures -which increas- ingly came to include flexible and complex languages, a great variety of forms of dif- ferentiated social organization, the development of skills of many different sorts, increasingly disciplined powers of imagination, the creation of innumerable kinds of artifacts including especially tools which extend human powers in many new direc-</page><page sequence="10">GORDON D. KAUFMAN tions, and so on-has affected significantly the actual biological development of the predecessors of today's homo sapiens. We are, then, all the way down to the deepest layers of our distinctively human existence, not simply biological beings, animals; we are biohistorical beings.13 I am not claiming that other primates are not in any respect also biohistorical; I am saying that it is, above all, the high development of our human historicity that gives our existence its most distinctively human character. Despite the great powers that our knowledge and technologies have given us, we are all aware that our transcendence of the natural orders within which we have emerged is far from adequate to assure our ongoing human existence; indeed, the ecological crisis of our own time has brought to our attention the fact that precisely through the exercise of our growing power on planet Earth we have been destroying the very conditions that make human life-and many other forms of life as well- possible. And we may have brought human existence to the brink of extinction. Paradoxically, then, our understanding of ourselves and of the world in which we live, and our growing power over many of the circumstances on planet Earth that have seemed to us undesirable, may in the end lead to our self-destruction. What kind of moves is it possible for us humans to make, when confronted with issues of this scope that go well beyond our established knowledge? It may be use- ful, at this point, to look briefly at certain aspects of the religious standpoint that contributed to the birth of Western culture, and which subsequently has continued to nourish our culture (at least to some extent). Our Western religious traditions have long emphasized that it is in and through moves offaith that humans address the deep but unavoidable mysteries of life-mysteries often connected with our dis- tinctive human powers as self-conscious agents, beings who must act, must take responsibility for ourselves even though the future may be inscrutable, beings with historicity. We are able to commit ourselves to this or that construal of the mysteries of life that confront us, and we can live and act in faithfulness to this commitment. It is important to recognize, however, that all such commitments go beyond the knowledge at our disposal. Human life is able to go on in face of profound baffle- ments because of our "will to believe" (as William James put it), that is, because of deep-seated attitudes of faith and trust and loyalty that enable us to continue mov- ing forward into uncertain futures, even though adequate pertinent knowledge is unavailable. What sort of faith-moves, then, have particularly characterized Western religious- ness? In the face of the ultimate mysteries of life and the world, how has the human situation been understood? Unlike most other religious standpoints, in the Hebraic vision--to which the West is heir-human life is construed as falling within a tem- poral/historical process: a created world, a world that began at a particular point in time, a world that developed in important ways through time because of God's con- tinuing activity within it. This human story includes both a fall away from God and the emergence of diverse human languages, cultures, and religious practices and beliefs; it culminates in God's expected overcoming of the sin and evil that humanity had brought into the world, thus bringing it to the perfection originally intended. Many details of the modern evolutionary conception of the development of life dif-</page><page sequence="11">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" fer sharply from this biblical story, but the overallform of these two accounts is much the same: in both, human life is understood within the context of a larger cosmic temporal/historical/evolutionary development. The biblical account, however, in contrast with the evolutionary story as usually presented, is able to give this developmental process profound human meaning. It displays (a) the human dimension of the story (human history) as possessing an over- all unity from beginning to end, brought about by God's purposive presence and activity throughout, an activity (b) believed to be creatively and redemptively mov- ing humankind toward the full realization of God's original loving purposes for humanity. That is, it was the ongoing presence and humanizing activity of God in this story that brought the past, present, and future of the world, and of humankind, within the world, together into a coherent whole of profound human meaning. Basic orientation for women and men was found, thus, in relation to God-God's pur- poses, God's ongoing activity, God's will for humankind. Motivation for humans to orient themselves in accordance with this vision was encouraged by the hope it offered of ultimate human realization and redemption, as God's purposes were con- summated. The connection between how things are in the world and which things really matter for humans (what is truly of importance to humans) was brought about and secured by the central role in the story, and the specific character, of God, whose activity bound the human (and cosmic) past, present, and future together into a sin- gle coherent and humanly meaningful account. Is there any way (we need to ask now) in connection with our modern/postmod- ern biohistorical evolutionary story, that the past, present, and future of human exis- tence generally-and of our individual lives in particular-can be situated within a similar unity of development? If we can give a positive answer to this question, we may be able to discern significant human meaningfulness in the evolutionary-histor- ical story that would otherwise not be visible to us. The other two concepts men- tioned above, "serendipitous creativity" and "directional movements" or "trajectories," can be of help in exploring this matter.14 v Movement in and through time, as traced today through the long history of the uni- verse and particularly through the evolution of life on earth, appears to be movement eventuating in unprecedented developments, in the appearance of ever new forms -not simply the occurrence of patterns that forever repeat themselves. Moreover, these novel developments -for example, the emergence of new evolutionary lines (new species)-each have specific potentialities for developing further in some directions but not in others. Such tendencies, as biologist Ernst Mayr says, "are the necessary consequence of the unity of the genotype which greatly constrains evolu- tionary potential."15 Ever more complex species have emerged along some evolu- tionary lines, and we can discern trajectories of a sort eventuating in these new forms. These trajectories are visible, however, only to the retrospective or backward-looking view that we humans necessarily take up when we survey the past; there is no rea- 13</page><page sequence="12">GORDON D. KAUFMAN son (from a biological standpoint, for example) to suppose that the process of evolu- tion has actually been directed, somehow, toward this or that specific goal, or toward any goal whatsoever. The processes of natural selection, it appears, themselves bring about the directional momentum that emerge along the various lines down which life has evolved. On one line (our own) what may be regarded as a new order of reality-histori- cal processes and events-has emerged (as noted above). The order of history, with its high development of cultures and modes of social organization, is the only con- text (so far as we know) within which beings with self-consciousness, with highly developed imaginative powers and creativity, with freedom and responsible agency, have appeared. It is not that the evolution of life has been a sort of straightline move- ment, up from the primeval slime to humanity with its historicity and complex his- tories: evolutionary developments have obviously gone in many directions. More- over, it is not evident that the human form is as biologically viable as are many other forms. So from a strictly biological point of view (with its emphasis on survival, per- petuation of the species), there is little reason to think that human life is the most successful or important product of the evolutionary process. We are not, however, confining ourselves here to strictly biological considerations: our principal concern is to understand our own reality and situation-as biohistorical beings-in the hope that this will assist us in finding an appropriate way to orient ourselves today in the evolutionary-ecological world. As we have noted, fully human beings (beings with great symbolic facility, beings with historicity) did not appear simply as the last stage of a strictly biological process: it was only after many millennia of historical developments (in concert with contin- uing biological evolution) that human existence as we presently know it came on the scene. Moreover, only with the fairly recent emergence of the historical standpoint of late modernity has this biological-historical movement eventuating in contemporary humankind become visible to us humans. As we today look back, however, at the gradually cumulating evolutionary, historical, and ecological development that pro- duced us, outlines of a cosmic trajectory issuing in the creation of beings with histor- icity become discernible. There are, no doubt, many other cosmic trajectories as well, moving in quite different directions. But, from where we humans stand-with our specifically human needs and interests, and our contemporary human values -the emergence of this particular trajectory is obviously of great importance: this mani- festation of the serendipitous creativity in the cosmos has given us men and women our very existence, and it quite properly, therefore, evokes from us both awe and grat- itude. Let me make myself clear: I am not claiming that we humans are the best, or the highest, or the most important of all species of life. I am claiming that because of our great knowledge and power-especially our power to destroy so much of life -the extraordinarily complex question of our proper place in the ecological order on earth is one that demands our address today. To emphasize, as I have just been doing, the connection of what is distinctive about human existence- our humanness, our historicity-with the mystery of creativity in the world, is to take a step of faith. It is, moreover, a movement of faith not as</page><page sequence="13">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" uncommon among intellectuals these days as might at first be supposed: speculation about, and search for, intelligent life elsewhere in the universe presupposes that there is some elemental dynamism in the cosmos that can issue in the emergence in diverse locations of what we have here been calling historicity-human-like reality; and this presupposition (this faith) gives rise to the hope that we may, if we search long enough and carefully enough, eventually uncover signs of similar highly complex forms of life in regions far removed from planet Earth. Where the particular trajec- tory that brought human existence into being on our planet will move in the future, we do not, of course, know-perhaps toward the opening of ever new possibilities for human beings, as we increasingly take responsibility for our lives and our future; perhaps going beyond humanity and historicity altogether, however difficult it is to image how that should be understood; perhaps coming to an end in the total destruc- tion of human life. Construing the cosmos in this way, as constituted by (a) cosmic serendipitous creativity which (b) manifests itself through trajectories of various sorts working themselves out in longer and shorter stretches of time (a conception consonant with modern evolutionary thinking though not necessary to it), can help us discern our place within the evolutionary-ecological universe that is our home. Our human exis- tence-its purpose, its greatly varied complexes of social/moral/cultural/religious values and meanings, its virtually unlimited imaginative powers and glorious cre- ativity, its horrible failures and gross evils, its historicity-has, from this vantage point, a distinctive position within the vast (seemingly) impersonal cosmic order. With the emergence of historical modes of being-human being-explicitly pur- posive (or teleological) patterns have appeared in the universe, as human intentions, consciousness, and actions began to become effective. That is, a cosmic trajectory, which had its origins in what seems to have been mere physical movement or vibra- tion, has (in this particular instance) gradually developed increasing directionality, ultimately creating a context within which deliberate purposive action could emerge and flourish.16 With the help of our three new concepts we are beginning to gain some orientation in the universe (as we think of the universe today). First, this approach provides us with a frame within which we can characterize quite accurately, and can unify into an overall vision, what seems actually to have happened, so far as we know, in the course of cosmic evolution and history. Second, this approach gives a significant, but not dominant, place and meaning to the dis- tinctive biohistorical character of human life within this cosmic process; in so doing it identifies the ecological niche that humankind occupies within this process as itself, necessarily, a biohistorical one. Such a niche can be properly defined and described (as we have seen) only by specifying carefully not only the physical and biological features required for human life to go on, but the importance of certain historical features as well. It is, for example, only in sociocultural contexts that some measure of justice, freedom, order, and mutual respect sufficiently prevail, and in which dis- tribution of the goods of life (food, shelter, health, education, economic opportu- nity, and so on) is sufficiently equitable, that children in each new generation can be expected to have a reasonable chance of maturing into responsible and productive</page><page sequence="14">GORDON D. KAUFMAN adult women and men-women and men, that is to say, who can take the sort of responsibility for their society and for planet Earth that is now demanded of human beings worldwide. The biohistorical features of our human ecological niche them- selves thus provide, third, a framework that can assist communities (and individu- als), as they develop notions of value and meaning, to understand better and assess more fully both the adequacy of the biological context of their lives and the import of the historical sociocultural developments through which they are living, thus enabling them to take up more responsible roles within these contexts and develop- ments.17 Fourth, because this approach highlights the linkage of serendipitous cosmic cre- ativity with our humanness and the humane values so important to us, as well as with our ecological niche, it can support hope (but not certainty) for the future of our human world. It is a hope about the overall direction of future human history-hope for truly creative movement toward ecologically and morally responsible, though still quite pluralistic, human existence. Finally, fifth, a hope of this sort, grounded on the mystery of creativity in the world-a creativity that, on our trajectory, evidences itself in part through our own creative powers-can help motivate us men and women to devote our lives to bringing about this more humane and ecologically rightly ordered world to which we all aspire. (This hope, of course, carries much less assur- ance and specificity than traditional religious expectations of the coming of God's kingdom.) In this way our human past, present, and future are drawn together in an overall vision of the ongoing biohistorical process in which we are situated-our niche within the ecology of planet Earth-a vision, moreover, that will help us iden- tify and address the problems in today's world that most urgently demand our atten- tion. This frame of orientation or vision of reality is not, of course, in any way forced upon us: it can be appropriated (as I have suggested) only by means of our own per- sonal and collective decisions, our own acts of faith in face of the ultimate mystery of life and the world. This is a frame with sufficient richness and specification to pro- vide significant orientation for our time, but that can be accomplished only if we decide to commit ourselves to it, ordering our lives and building our futures in the terms prescribed. Acceptance of this vision can help women and men-not only those who think of themselves as religious in some more or less traditional sense but also modern /postmodern women and men of other quite different persuasions -to gain some sense of identity, some sense of who we humans are and what we ought to be doing with our lives. And the hope that the momentum of our biohistorical tra- jectory will move forward creatively toward a more humane and ecologically well- ordered world can help motivate us men and women to give ourselves in strong com- mitment to that trajectory's continuing growth and development. The world, I am proposing, can be seen today as a serendipitous process consti- tuted by a variety of trajectories. On one of these, in due course, the historical order emerged. This trajectory, including its biohistorical extension (on which we humans find ourselves), represents at least one significant direction in which the cosmic pro- cess has been moving in our region of the universe. We humans today are being</page><page sequence="15">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" drawn beyond our present condition and order of life by creative impulses in this trajectory suggesting decisions and movements now required of us. If we respond, in appropriately creative ways, to the historical and ecological forces now impinging upon us on all sides, there is a possibility-though no certainty-that a niche for humankind, better fitted to the wider ecological order on earth than our present niche, may be brought into being. However, if we fail to so respond, it seems likely that we humans may not survive much longer. Are we willing to commit ourselves to live and act in accord with the imperatives laid upon us by the biohistorical situ- ation in which we find ourselves, in the hope that our actions will be supported and enhanced by cosmic, serendipitous creative events? In my view it is this kind of hope, and faith, and commitment to which the trajectory that has brought us into being now calls us. VI I have thus far deliberately refrained in these remarks from closely connecting the ideas of serendipitous creativity and of evolutionary and historical trajectories with the more traditional notions (to which they correspond) of God and God's activity. It has seemed to me important that the question about the appropriateness and use- fulness of these ideas be considered in their own right, as suggestive interpretations of the evolutionary-ecological universe in which we today take ourselves to be liv- ing, whatever may be their specifically theological significance. But I would like to point out now that this world-picture can without great difficulty be regarded as providing a way to construe the symbol "God" today-provided one recognizes that the word "God" has always designated a mystery ultimately beyond human com- prehension, and thus does not insist that God be conceived in traditional terms. If we regard the serendipitous creativity to which this world-picture calls our attention as that which can most appropriately be thought of today as God-thus employing the most comprehensive and profound symbol of the ultimate mystery of things in our Western cultures and languages-its full religious potential and significance will come directly into view. As I have tried to show in my book, In Face ofMystery, it is not difficult to set out the main outlines of this world picture in theocentric- indeed, specifically Christian-terms. It will be obvious to all, I presume, that a world picture of this sort evokes a sig- nificantly different faith and hope than that associated with the Christian symbol- system as traditionally interpreted. There are, however, some important continuities, continuities significant enough to warrant considering this picture of the world, and the human place within it, as appropriate for Christian faith today. In particular, this world picture overcomes completely the respects in which (as we noted in Part II of this essay) traditional understandings of the central Christian symbols blur, and must be regarded as partly responsible for, today's ecological crisis. First, and most important: Understanding the ultimate mystery of things, God, in terms of the metaphor of serendipitous creativity manifesting itself in a variety of evolutionary and historical trajectories-instead of in terms of the essentially anthro- 17</page><page sequence="16">GORDON D. KAUFMAN pomorphic creator/lord/father metaphors, with God depicted as working out specif- ically anthropocentric intentions or purposes in the natural world and in the course of human affairs in history-facilitates (more effectively, in fact, than the traditional imagery did) maintaining a decisive qualitative distinction (though not an ontolog- ical separation) between God and the created order. Such a distinction, perhaps the most important contribution of monotheistic religious orientations to human self- understanding, provides the basis for regarding God (creativity, in this proposed scheme) as the sole appropriate focus for human devotion and worship, that which alone can properly orient human life in today's world. All other realities, being finite, transitory, and corruptible-created goods which come into being and pass away rather than the creative good from which other goods all come, as H. N. Wieman put it18--become dangerous idols which, when worshipped and made the focus of human orientation, inevitably bring disaster into human affairs. This important dis- tinction between God and the idols is strongly emphasized in the symbolic picture I am sketching here. Second, in keeping with this first point: Conceiving humans as biohistorical beings who have emerged on one of the countless creative trajectories moving through the cosmos-instead of as the climax of all creation, distinguished from all other crea- tures as the very "image of God"-makes it clear that we humans are indissolubly a part of the created order, and not in any way to be confused with the serendipitous creativity which has produced not only us but the entire cosmos, in all its complex- ity, order, and beauty. So in the picture I am sketching here the too-easy anthropo- centrism of traditional Christian thinking is thoroughly undercut. But it is undercut in a nonreductive way. The failure (characteristic of many anti-religious or anti-ide- alistic interpretations of the human) to recognize that there is something radically distinctive about human beings, something for which we know of no real parallels elsewhere in the created order-namely the freedom, self-consciousness, imagina- tion, and creativity that enables us humans to take significant responsibility for our- selves, our future, our world-is here completely avoided. Indeed, our human cre- ativity, producing in the course of a long history a magnificent spread of quite diverse cultures and societies (diverse ways of being human), may be said to hark back in some respects to the traditional conception of the imago Dei. Here, however, it is clear that our creativity can exist only (as far as we are aware) within the boundaries and conditions of life found on the trajectory within the created order in which it has appeared. Moreover, it is a creativity which (as is all too obvious) is a principal source of evil in human affairs as well as of good. This quite dim "image" of the divine cre- ativity should not so easily tempt men and women today (as the traditional doctrine of the "imago Dei" did in past Christian reflection) to think of themselves as the "crown of creation," even (in some versions) nurturing hopes for and expectations of "deification" as the appropriate final destiny for us humans-a dream of complete escape from the created ecological order within which we were born, as we are exalted into an ultimate unity with God. The understanding of God and of the human presented here, I suggest, is com- pletely open to and in accord with current ecological thinking; moreover, it gives an</page><page sequence="17">ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL "GOD" interpretation of that thinking which renders human life profoundly meaningful. Though strikingly different in important respects from certain traditional Christian emphases, it nevertheless presents a form of radical monotheism (to use H. R. Nie- buhr's term)19 that can be developed into a full-orbed Christian interpretation of human faith and life, an interpretation appropriate to the understandings and con- straints of modern /postmodern thinking and existence.20 In view of the problematic character of traditional interpretations of some central Christian themes, when examined in light of current ecological concerns (as discussed in Part II above), I therefore propose this reconstruction of the conceptions of God and humanity as providing a way to move forward today with the very broad question of "Chris- tianity and Ecology." AN AFTERTHOUGHT (4/28/98)21 Reading the two responses to my paper, I became conscious of an enormous over- sight in my whole approach to this conference. Though I have been engaged in Buddhist-Christian dialogue for many years, and should thus have been well aware of the fact that persons coming from diverse religious and cultural traditions often do not share some of their deepest assumptions, I failed to take this into account in a way that I should have in writing this paper. I simply assumed that all of us think about ecological issues, and what might be called today's ecological crisis, in quite similar ways, and that my task, therefore, was to state as straightforwardly as I could what this means for Christian theological reflection and construction today. So I did not sketch out explicitly the kind of ecological consciousness and ecological crisis to which I was addressing myself (fortunately Stephanie Kaza has done that beautifully), and I certainly did not make explicit or attempt to justify the basic presuppositions (metaphysical, epistemological, scientific, and the like) on which these rest. As I read the two responses to my paper, it became clear to me that that was a huge omission, for it meant that my Buddhist respondents (who clearly think about this question in very different terms) would not take up that issue directly either-and precisely on that point we might have had some of our most interesting discussion. (As nearly as I can tell from the papers of most of the other Americans, they think about this question much as I do.) I think it is important for some explicit discussion of these matters to occur here at our conference. I cannot in these brief comments repair the damage of my ethnocentric oversight. I do want to call to the attention of all of us here, however, that my thinking-and I believe the thinking of most Westerners about ecology and about what many of us call the ecological crisis--is heavily dependent on the modern sciences of biology, chemistry, geology, meteorology, cosmology, and the like. That is, we believe what many in these disciplines have been telling us about the deterioration of the envi- ronment, especially in recent decades, and about the human input and thus respon- sibility for that deterioration. In so doing we accept much of the modern evolu- tionary picture of the cosmos and the development of life on earth-a picture in which time's arrow is taken to move essentially forward, never again to return to pre- 19</page><page sequence="18">GORDON D. KAUFMAN vious evolutionary or historical stages. This is a characteristically Western way of see- ing the cosmic environment in which human life transpires, a way likely rooted in Hebrew thinking about God's relation to the world: first, creating it, then working out purposes through time so that it will eventually come to the end for which it was originally created-an essentially developmental picture of the whole created order. This picture is taken over in the modern sciences (though without its original teleological features) in their cosmological reflection and their theories about the ori- gins and evolution of life. Little attention is given to this developmental scientific pre- supposition underlying most modern Western thinking about ecology by either of my respondents, both of whom appear to hold largely to a traditional Eastern cycli- cal picture of the cosmic order in which life appears. But the notion of an ecologi- cal crisis which we humans have brought about, a crisis affecting all of life on earth and which may ultimately bring the human project to an end forever, clearly pre- supposes an understanding of time as always moving forward, never returning to its earlier stages. The scientific concept of entropy also emphasizes this unidirectional movement of time. One of the things we need to discuss here is how these notions of temporal devel- opment are to be related to the typically Buddhist understandings of the place of humanity in its cosmic setting. We Christians are able to take these notions of uni- directional temporality largely for granted, and do so as we attempt to re-think our faith in relation to contemporary ecological and evolutionary issues. This makes it possible (as I argued in my paper) to integrate major Christian ideas with modern scientific thinking. It is not clear to me from the Buddhist papers, however, how the evolutionary-developmental view of time, which is presupposed in the modern cos- mological and biological sciences (and thus in modern ecological thinking), can be similarly integrated with Buddhist ideas of nature's eternal rhythms. I'm sorry that my paper did not bring out these issues in the way that (as I now see it) it should have. But I hope we can give them an important place in our con- versations nevertheless. NOTES 1.

Most Christian theologians appear not to regard the theological problems posed by modern ecological and evolutionary understandings of human beings to be as serious as do I; they therefore continue to work within the traditional framework that pictures God as cre- ator/lord/father of the universe and all within it. A path-breaking writer on ecological issues, working with this view, was Joseph Sittler, "A Theology for Earth," The Christian Scholar (1954) 37:367-374. Others who deserve mention for their early theological work on ecolog- ical issues are Conrad Bonifazi, A Theology of Things (Lippincott, 1967); Philip Hefner, "Towards a New Doctrine of Man: The Relationship of Man and Nature," in Bernard E. Meland (ed.), The Future ofEmpirical Theology (University of Chicago Press, 1969); Frederick Elder, Crisis in Eden: A Religious Study ofMan and Environment (Abingdon Press, 1970); and H. Paul Santmire, Brother Earth: Nature, God and Ecology in Time of Crisis (Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1970). About the same time, Lynn White, Jr. published a widely influential article strongly criticizing what he regarded as Christian theological sources of modern ecological problems: "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis," Science (1967) 155:1203-1207. A good many important theologically oriented writings on ecological matters have appeared over subsequent years, some of them calling for fairly radical theological reconstruction. Three recent ones will be mentioned here: John Cobb and Hermann Daly, For the Common Good, Second Ed. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994); Sallie McFague, The Body of God: An Ecological Theology (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993); and Rosemary Ruether, Gaia and God: An Eco- feminist Theology of Earth Healing (San Francisco: Harper, 1992). In my view, perhaps the most important study of the biblical material bearing on ecological questions is to be found in the recent work by Theodore Hiebert, The Yahwists Landscape (Oxford University Press, 1996). 5. See (among many others) the widely influential book with this title by G. Ernest Wright (S.C.M. Press, 1952). 6. The Hebrew vocabulary did not even have a term corresponding to our word "nature" (see H. W. Robinson, Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1946], ch. 1). It was a nineteenth and twentieth century mistake, however, for scholars to have reached the conclusion that there is virtually no interest in the natural environment in the Old Testament, that all attention was focused on history, and God's acts in history. The earliest strands of the Old Testament (attributed to the "J" writer) present a humanity immersed in and highly dependent on (what we regard as) the natural order round about. For a full discussion of these matters, see Hiebert, op. cit. 7. Even Jonathan Edwards, with his systemic holistic thinking and his well-known inter- est in the natural world had no doubts that "the last end for which God has made moral agents must be the last end for which God has made all things: it being evident, that the moral world is the end of the rest of the world; the inanimate and unintelligible world being made for the rational and moral world, as much as a house is prepared for the inhabitants" (The Nature of True Virtue [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1960], p. 25). In highly influential nineteenth-twentieth century theological texts we still find such remarks as the fol- lowing: ". . . nature is called into being to serve as a means to God's essential purpose in cre- ating a world of spirits . . . the creation of nature by God is ... a relative necessity, the neces- sity, namely, of serving as a means to God's previously chosen end of calling into being a multitude of spirits akin to Himself ... The whole universe, therefore, considered thus as the precondition of the moral kingdom of created spirits, is throughout God's creation for this end" (Albrecht Ritschl, The Christian Doctrine ofJustification and Reconciliation [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1900], pp. 279f.). This general point of view continued on into neo-ortho- doxy: for a thorough examination of Karl Barth's theology on this matter, see Paul Santmire, "Creation and Nature: A Study of the Doctrine of Nature with Special Attention to Karl Barth's Doctrine of Creation" (Harvard University, Ph.D. dissertation, 1966). 8. As Paul Tillich noted, Spinoza's formula, "deus sive natura ... indicates that the name 'God' does not add anything to what is already involved in the name 'nature"' (Systematic Theology [University of Chicago Press, 1951], Vol. I, p. 262).</page><page sequence="20">GORDON D.

It has recently begun to appear possible, even likely, that the continuous increase in entropy over time in the universe may itself, in the natural course of events, give rise- through the development of so-called "dissipative systems"-to complex forms of organiza- tion, eventually including living systems. ". . . [T]he picture that is emerging in ... recent thermodynamic analyses . . . [suggests that] the movement of the [entropic] stream itself inevitably generates, as it were, very large eddies within itself in which, far from there being a decrease of order, there is an increase first in complexity and then in something more subtle- functional organization.... There could be no self-consciousness and human creativity with- out living organization, and there could be no such living dissipative systems unless the entropic stream followed its general, irreversible course in time. Thus does the apparently decaying, randomizing tendency of the universe provide the necessary and essential matrix (motjuste!)
