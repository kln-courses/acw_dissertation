<plain_text><page sequence="1">Time and the Physical World. By Richard Schlegel. Michigan State University Press, 1961. Pp. xii + 211. $7.50 THE present book, by a physics professor at the Michigan State University, presents many sides to the question of time and, indeed, in an admirably clear fashion. The author advocates the relational doctrine of time, i.e. the Aristotle-Lucretius idea that time, far from flowing of itself, is insepar- able from events and is a sort of pace of change. This idea-the historical roots of which are barely mentioned-is adequately presented in Chapter I, on' Time and Physical Process ', which is probably the best. The remaining chapters provide additional arguments in favour of the doctrine. On more fundamental issues the book is disappointing. The concept of time appears so crystal-clear to some, and so obscure to others, that very few studies have been devoted to it. A careful analysis of this concept is supposed to require both factual science and logic; unfor- tunately, we are still waiting for a monograph on time meeting these E 65</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS requirements, and for a long while we may at most hope for stimulating essays on that elusive yet basic concept. Logicians have tended to focus on sentences containing the term 'time' without enquiring into either the logical structure of the concept or of the theories involving time, and physicists have tended to overlook the logical problems of time as well as the peculiarities of non-physical (i.e. psychological, biological, and historical) time. As a result, although we have physical theories of time or, rather, of space-time (namely, relativity theories), we lack a philosophical theory of time. The present book, however, fails to fill this gap. The reading of the book requires only elementary physics and no philo- sophical background at all. Only the realisation of the book's inadequacies requires a little more. In the first place, logic is not handled by the author as a tool of analysis. Consequently we are not told why, or at least that, time is usually regarded as a primitive concept in physics, and nothing is said of the structure of the time concept, although it should not be im- possible to say a few things about this, if only to lift the mist that envelops the time concept in philosophy. For example, in the context of the rela- tional doctrine of time one might take duration as a primitive and regard it as a two-place numerical functor, namely thus: ' the duration, in seconds, of the event [or process, or cycle] x, relative to the reference system y, equals the number t '. Then, one might define 'instant' as the frontier between any two contiguous non-overlapping durations, and' time' as the set of all durations. In the second place, the old philosophical problem of the reality of time is not approached, presumably on the assumption that, since material change -which is assumed to be real-is described with the help of the time concept, then the latter must have a real referent. Yet not all physical variables need symbolise real traits. Besides, there is a simple and common device by means of which time can be ' eliminated '. In fact, ' x occurred at t relative to y ' can always be replaced by ' x occurred jointly with z relative to y ', where 'jointly with ' may, but need not, be defined as ' at the same time as ' After all, timing by means of clocks is precisely such a device for establishing one-many correspondences among sets of events. From the proposition that, if there is no change, then there is no time, we infer (by contraposition) that, if there is time, then there is change. But we cannot infer that time is in the things themselves, just as from the applicability of arithmetics we do not infer that numbers have an independent existence. A care for logic would have made such an analysis possible and would have precluded the occurrence of inaccurate phrases such as these: 'the essential elements of the entropy concept' (p. 21), 'a force acting on a mass' (p. 32), or ' the uncertainty relation prevents a physical process from being without time error ' (p. 168). Schlegel's discussion of physical theory could often be improved. Thus, 66</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS e.g., the time reversibility of Maxwell's equations in vacuum is established with reference to only one of the triplets, which forces the author to intro- duce charged particles into the picture as a deus ex machina. The t-invariance of Maxwell's equations can only be established by discussing the two triplets together or, even better, by discussing the second-order equations. Besides, a careful distinction should be drawn between t-invariance as a mathematical property of physical laws, and physical reversibility, especially since not all time reversals can be regarded as real.' Incidentally, the electromagnetic field is not described ' by a single vector field' (p. 43) but by a single tensor field; and it should have been said that, in the quantum theory, a change in the sign of t is accompanied by other operations (at least by complex con- jugation). Another example of a scientific inaccuracy is the assertion that 'it is perhaps not far-fetched to assume that space, which does propagate electromagnetic waves that can constitute themselves into positrons and electrons or other forms of matter, may also on relatively rare occasions spontaneously give rise to matter ' (p. 72). In the first place, the ' creation ' of particles out of photons is possible only in the vicinity of other particles (e.g. nuclei); in the second place, although one can certainly imagine the creation of matter out of nothing, one cannot scientifically sustain this magico-religious conjecture, which is both empirically unwarranted and in- consistent with the best physical theory. Also, it is not true that the oscil- lating model of the universe presupposes that the radius of the universe is finite (p. 71); in fact, the variable R(t) occurring in the line element of all relativistic cosmologies, whether oscillating or not, is just a scale factor. Further, that' all natural processes occur with either a net increase in entropy, or, just possibly, with no net entropy change' (p. 23), must be a slip, since atomic phenomena are not entropic. Nor is it true that, if a system is in a state of constant energy, then it is atemporal (pp. 170-172); obviously only the converse is true, since constant total energy is consistent with energy transformations (of, e.g., mechanical into thermal energy); and a stationary state is not a changeless state but one characterised by certain constant prob- abilities and averages. Finally, the mu-meson does not decay into an elec- tron and two positrons (p. 181), but into an electron, a neutrino, and an antineutrino. Where red lights must be kindled in greatest numbers is in the chapters devoted to relativity. A recurring thought is this: ' The public nature of a clock-the fact that it can be read by many observers at once-requires that it have the same reading, and in a sense the same physical behavior, for observers in all co-ordinate systems. The traditional special relativity theory doctrine [sic] does tell us that clocks run differently as a result of rela- tive motion, but does not tell us that clock readings of a given clock vary from system to system' (p. 128). One would rather say the opposite, namely, 1 Cf. M. Bunge, 'Laws of Physical Laws ', Amer.Jour. Physics, 1961, 29, 518 67</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS that relativity, and even the mere recognition that light does not propagate instantaneously, tells us that the readings of a given clock vary from system to system even if they are not in relative motion. A discussion of proper time (i.e. absolute time) would have saved many mistakes; unfortunately this key concept is not even mentioned. The result is that a wrong solution to the' clock paradox ' is proposed. Schlegel's original contribution in this book is, in fact, the dissolution of the famous ' paradox ' by proposing a dis- tinction between what he calls Clausius processes and Lorentz processes. The former would not involve Lorentz transformations whereas the latter would involve them. Thus, e.g., the clock's inner motions would be a Clausius process but the readings of the clock would be Lorentz processes to which relativity applies. Moreover, the Lorentz transformations would apply only to physical interactions. The latter conjecture is interesting though not new.1 But the distinction between Clausius and Lorentz processes runs counter to the very existence of relativistic thermodynamics; in fact, if there were Clausius processes this theory would be simply wrong, which is unlikely if only because it is the child of special relativity and the hypothesis of molecular chaos. In order to dissolve the clock 'paradox' there is no need to postulate that relativity does not apply in the case of the twins, one of which makes a space travel and returns, still young, to meet his aged brother. The most reasonable way out is to say that there is no paradox, that the mistake arises from wrongly manipulating quantities relating to two different reference systems (the stationary and the moving ones), instead of referring all the values to a single reference system, as should always be done.2 Another way of reaching the same conclusion is to employ the proper time in com- puting the retardation, since the proper time is invariant; unfortunately the concept of proper time does not occur in the book. The whole way of handling the relativity theory is mistaken, because it consists in (i) re-interpreting some theorems without touching the axioms, and (ii) adding some ad hoc assumptions. In proposing to apply the Lorentz transformations to the photons rather than to the mechanical systems (such as rods and clocks), Schlegel is actually proposing a new (non-Lorentz covariant!) field theory. In particular, if photons from a given source do behave differently with respect to observers moving relatively to each other, as Schlegel maintains, then the old ether must somehow be resurrected, and the ad hoc hypothesis must be added that' photons, as it were, must " know " when to hurry up so as to interact at velocity c with an observer who is receding from the source' (p. 143). If one wishes to propose a new theory 1 See M. Bunge, Causality, Cambridge (Mass.), 1959, p. 261: 'the Lorentz trans- formation formulas might be interpreted as expressing a mutual dependence among mechanical reference systems via the electromagnetic field.' 2 See G. Builder, ' Resolution of the Clock Paradox ', Amer. Jour. Physics, 1959, 27, 656 68</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS of light one is at liberty to do it, but one will not succeed in this enterprise by re-interpreting theorems of a theory of mechanics as propositions regard- ing photons-let alone by introducing an anthropomorphic and finalistic conjecture. Knowledge about photons is preferable to assumptions regard- ing knowing photons. In conclusion, this book is one more failure in the age-old attempt to grasp the concept of time. On this occasion, the source of the failure is clear: want of logic and sloppy science. The relational theory of time surely deserves a further, more careful, treatment.
