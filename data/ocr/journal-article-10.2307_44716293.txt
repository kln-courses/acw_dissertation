Trosien Biomechanics Research Center, Wayne State University VEHICLE OCCUPANT PROTECTION is achieved when the occupant is decelerated during a collision without exceeding his injury tolerance level. Current safety technology indicates that the best way to achieve protection is by restraining the occupant within the vehicle. Controlled occupant deceleration is provided by tailoring the restraint system and/or by utilizing part of the vehicle deceleration to decelerate the occupant (ride down). The major restraint systems currently under de- velopment are the airbag and the harness. A detailed descrip- tion of an airbag system for installation on the steering assembly is presented, together with an analysis of its perfor- mance during full-scale simulated and destructive collisions. A comparison of the airbag performance with that of harness systems under identical impact conditions is included. More effort appears to be directed toward the development of the passenger airbag system than the driver airbag system, as evidenced by the greater number of publications pertaining to the passenger system. Development of the passenger sys- tem is not complicated by the steering assembly as is the driver system. Statistics show that the passenger is more vulnerable to injury than the driver, which may be a contributing factor to the greater emphasis placed on the passenger airbag system. Note: This paper is based upon the results of DOT Contract FH- 11-7607. *Currently with Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. While the passenger is more vulnerable to injury than the driver in a given impact condition, there are a greater number of driver exposures since there is always a driver in the moving vehicle. Design and installation of the driver airbag system are complicated by the steering assembly. Concepts that have been suggested include an airbag system mounted in the header, above the steering wheel, with the airbag deploying downward between the steering wheel and the driver. An- other proposed system has the airbag installed in the instru- ment panel, deploying over the steering wheel and down be- tween the driver and the wheel. These two systems do not appear to be feasible, since the distance the bag must travel is large, and thus a high velocity is required for deployment before the driver moves forward too great a distance. Installa- tion of the airbag system in the steering wheel appears to be the most feasible approach to solving the problem. A steering wheel-mounted airbag system must be light in weight and small in package size. A heavy system mounted on the steering wheel increases the force on the driver during the impact due to the increased inertia of the moving part of the energy-absorbing steering assembly. The size of the nonde- ployed system mounted on the steering wheel is also limited by the necessity for the driver to see the instruments and, in some cases, through the steering wheel in order to drive the car. Any steering assembly installation must not interfere with the normal driving task. In general, the requirements of a successful driver airbag ABSTRACT This paper discusses a program wherein studies were made of forward force simulations of crashes and destructive barrier crashes using a shaped steering assembly airbag. It was shown that the airbag offered the best protection when compared with the performance of lap belts and lap and shoulder belt combinations. This shaped airbag deploys between the abdo- men and the steering wheel and between the head and the steering wheel, thus providing protection of these two impor- tant areas. 2938</page><page sequence="2">system include deceleration of the head and torso without injury. In a collision without a restraint system, the driver moves forward relative to the vehicle in his precollision posture until part of his body strikes the vehicle interior. In the usual case, the knees strike the instrument panel, the abdomen hits the lower steering wheel rim, the chest often makes contact with the steering wheel hub, and the face or neck strikes the upper steering wheel rim. The function of the steering assem- bly airbag is to prevent injurious contact of the head and torso with the steering wheel by applying a distributed force over these body areas at a subinjury level. Protection of the knees is accomplished by a crushable instrument panel or, in some cases, a knee airbag. The system described in this paper ac- complishes the above requirements by an airbag installed in the steering wheel and a custom instrument panel to provide a controlled crush at subinjury forces to the knees. BACKGROUND As a result of the failure of the general public to take ad- vantage of the safety features available (safety belts) and the reluctance of the government to legislate their mandatory use, the present trend is toward a passive restraint system. In this respect, the energy-absorbing steering column is a passive re- straint system, as are the instrument panel and windshield to a lesser extent, since they provide protection with no action required on the part of the occupant. These latter passive de- vices are not nearly as effective as the harness or the inflatable occupant restraint systems, both of which provide much greater stopping distances. A brief review of the advantages and disadvantages of the airbag system puts the problem in correct perspective. The advantages of the airbag system include: 1. It is always available when needed (passive restraint). 2. It provides optimum load distribution. 3. It usually results in minimum injury parameters. 4. It does not restrict occupant mobility during normal ve- hicle operation. The disadvantages of the airbag system are: 1 . It is more complex than other restraint systems. 2. There is little highway experience with it. 3. Current designs provide only limited protection in other than forward-force collisions. 4. It does not keep the driver in position to control the ve- hicle in subinflation collisions. 5. There is a possibility of inadvertent deployment (reliabil- ity, sensor design). 6. There is a possibility of nondeployment in a collision (reliability). 7. There is danger of an explosion of the energy source (reliability). 8. Current designs have a high noise level (not expected to be a serious problem). 9. It is considerably more expensive than other restraint systems. The advantages and disadvantages of the airbag system are based on comparisons with the harness, which is the only other viable system currently available. Probably the most potent argument in favor of the airbag is its availability when needed. No matter how good other systems are, if they are not used they will not provide protection. Since harness systems are only used from 5% (lap and shoulder) to 35% (lap) of the time (1)*, it is obvious that no matter how good they are, they cannot protect a major portion of the driving public. The harness system is designed to distribute the decelerating force over the occupant's body in those areas that can withstand the greatest force with minimum injury. Even with a well-de- signed harness, however, the distribution is not as good as a well-designed airbag system. Thus, the airbag system can, theoretically, apply greater forces than other restraints to the human body without exceeding the tolerance of the occupant. Stated in another way, the injury criteria as measured from accelerometers mounted in the dummy occupants are usually lower with the airbag than the currently available harness sys- tems. The complexity of the airbag system contributes to the higher cost, and also to a concern for reliability. The com- plexity is no greater than that of many other systems used in the automobile; consequently, there is no reason to believe that the reliability and cost cannot be brought into a reason- able range. In the rare case of nondeployment during a major collision, the occupants are no worse off than if they did not have the airbag installed. Even in the extremely unlikely con- dition of inadvertent deployment, the event may not cause a catastrophic collision, and the incidence of such inadvertent deployment should be as low as, or lower than, other operating systems affecting safety in the vehicle. The airbag system provides protection primarily in forward- force collisions in its present state of development. Also, it does not provide protection in subinflation collisions. Both of these items favor the harness system if it is utilized. The biggest disadvantage of the airbag system at the present time is a lack of highway experience. It is imperative that the system be installed in a large sample of automobiles to provide some experience in its performance during normal highway use before it is installed in all vehicles. If the highway experience shows it to be as beneficial as laboratory experi- ments indicate, and if the harness systems, either passive or mandatory active, are not used, there appears to be little doubt that the airbag system will be grossly beneficial in re- ducing highway fatalities and injuries. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The major airbag system components are: 1 . Crash sensor. 2. Initiator. 4. Inflator or energy source. 4. Manifold or diffuser. 5. Airbag. 6. Housing. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 2939</page><page sequence="3">2940 L. M. PATRICK, ET AL. Each of the major components has been treated in detail by other authors, so their function will be described only briefly as they pertain to the system under consideration. The sensor is a device that determines that a significant col- lision has occurred. It must sense the collision in 10-15 ms, with the lower value perferred, and must differentiate between a significant collision and a severe bump or minor collision below the designed threshold limit. Accelerations of 50 g magnitude can be achieved for very short times by slamming the hood or door of the car. Obviously, the airbag must not deploy under these conditions. Therefore, the purpose of the sensor is to determine that a significant collision has occurred and to initiate the airbag inflation cycle. A seismic spring- mass type of crash sensor was used in this research. The sensor, provided by the Eaton Corp., is shown in Fig. 1. The initiator is usually a squib or other explosive device. The sensor triggers the initiator in most cases by supplying an electrical pulse to the squib. Other types of initiators, used in stored-gas inflators, include a stab type for rupturing a highly stressed metal diaphragm and a prick type for rupturing a highly stressed glass diaphragm. In a gas generator inflator such as the Rocket Research Corp. unit used in this research, the initiator ignites the energy source (propellent). Three types of inflators are in widespread use. The stored- gas system was the first type to be used. Gas is stored at a pressure of approximately 3500 psi and released through a ruptured diaphragm to inflate the bag. Gas generators of the type used in this system obtain the gas for inflating the bag by burning a propellent. A third inflator, the hybrid system, is a combination of the above two in which less stored gas is re- quired than for a pure stored-gas system with additional gas obtained by burning a propellent. The gas-generator type of inflator used in this program con- sists of 18 individual generator units, each with its own initia- tor and propellent supply. All of the individual generator ele- ments are mounted on a common 5 in diameter nylon base. Each generator consists of a solid-propellent combustion chamber and a liquid Freon coolant chamber located imme- diately downstream from the combustion chamber. The cool- ant is contained by means of two burst discs- one located over the nozzle exit of the combustion chamber and one over the outlet of the gas generator element. The purpose of the Freon is to cool the gases to an acceptable level. Vaporization of the Freon cools the hot gas from the generator, and also increases the volume of the mix to assist in the bag inflation. Details regarding the construction and performance of the inflator are available from the manufacturer (2). The function of the manifold, or diffuser, is to prevent the high-velocity gas issuing out of the gas source from tearing or perforating the bag. Distribution is often accomplished by a tubular manifold with a series of slots or holes to provide a large number of openings through which the high-pressure gas escapes at a lower pressure. The manifold or diffuser function is accomplished in the system under consideration by the multiplicity of the generators, and also a deflector assembly against which the gases from the generators impinge. The de- flector directs the flow radially outward from the steering wheel hub. This tends to inflate the bag more efficiently and also reduces the thrust (the inflator is essentially a rocket). Fig. 2 is a composite photograph showing three views of the gas generator with the deflector assembly included in one view. The airbag is the envelope containing the gas from the in- flator and provides an interface between the occupant and the pressurized gas. Pressure in the bag varies from about 1.5 psi for the large passenger bags to values as high as 6-7 psi for the smaller driver airbag. In addition to the driver and passenger airbag, there is sometimes a knee bag for the driver or the pas- senger that provides a cushion for the knee. The knee bag usually operates at a higher pressure and can operate up to 30 psi. Since the airbag is of primary interest in this paper, it will be discussed in greater detail in the following section. The housing for the airbag system must contain the system and protect it from mechanical damage during long periods of vehicle use with the bag in its packed configuration. In addi- tion to the protective function, it must provide an opening through which the bag can deploy upon command. The open- ing is generally created by pressure buildup in the confined inflating bag. The pressure typically ruptures tear lines (built- in weak seams) in the housing and enables a door to hinge Fig. 1 - Eaton Corp. crash sensor</page><page sequence="4">SHAPED STEERING ASSEMBLY AIRBAG 2941 open, or a cover to split open in a manner similar to the blos- soming of a flower bud. A typical cover design used in this research is shown in Fig. 3, which illustrates the geometry of a complete inflator-bag-cover configuration mounted on a steer- ing wheel. AIRBAG DESIGN The material available for fabrication of the airbags is gener- ally limited to films and fabrics. For this program, fabric was considered to be superior to the films on the basis of strength, flexibility, low weight, small packed volume, minimal aging affect, small variation of physical characteristics with tempera- ture change, and variable porosity. Nylon fabrics of various weave patterns are widely used for airbags and were chosen for this program. Neoprene or other flexible coatings are used on Fig. 2 - Rocket Research Corp. Inflator the fabric if a nonporous material is desired. A good discus- sion of airbag materials is presented in Ref. 3. The final airbag design in this program utilized J. P. Stevens No. 34219 un- coated nylon fabric. Some material properties are listed in Table 1. The airbag, when inflated, is essentially an airspring. If the bag has no damping, the object impacting it will rebound with the same speed it had on impact. While there is always some natural damping, it is desirable to control the damping to provide the desired rebound condition. The goal for this pro- gram was to limit the rebound to approximately 30% of the impact speed. Damping can be accomplished by valves or by venting through a porous material. Several different valves were designed and tried with varying degrees of success. At the same time, a program was initiated to evaluate the porosity of material to permit a porous bag design without valves with the desired damping characteristics. An advantage of the porous bag over the use of most of the valves is that once the valves are opened, the bag deflates rapidly even though there is no force on it. With a porous bag design, it is possible to provide multiple-impact protection since the initial impact forces part of the air out of the bag, but once the impact is over, the re- maining gas tends to stay in the bag, ready for a second im- pact. It should be pointed out that the bag still deflates rapidly enough so that it does not impede egress after a colli- sion. A detailed analysis of fabric porosity, introducing a quantity referred to as "flow porosity," was conducted under the pro- gram. The results of the analysis (4) can be used in designing airbags to achieve desired porosity and damping characteristics. Flow porosity is defined as the mass rate-of-flow of air at room temperature through a unit surface area of fabric for a Fig. 3 - Final airbag system configuration</page><page sequence="5">2942 L. M. PATRICK, ET AL. given upstream pressure with atmospheric pressure down- stream. A plot of flow porosity versus pressure drop across the fabric is presented in Fig. 4 for the J. P. Stevens No. 34219 fabric used in the final airbag design. Analytical and experimental investigations of bag shape indicated that a flat circular disc is preferable to a spheroidal shape, which is the easiest to attain. A spheroidal bag mounted on the steering wheel hits the driver high on the chest and is forced upward as the occupant moves forward, due to the inclination of the steering wheel, exposing the lower rim for contact by the abdomen. The flat circular disc design permits the bag to be imposed between the rim and the abdomen. This provides a cushion to keep the con- centrated force of the rim from causing injury in the abdominal area. An analysis of the size of the airbag required included consideration of the possibility of keeping the bag within the diameter of the wheel so the driver could maintain control of the car even after the bag inflated. This was found to be impractical, and the final inflated bag size is 19 in in diameter, while the steering wheel is only 16.2 in in diameter. Any bag design made from a flat pattern tends to take the form of a sphere. The desired shape was obtained by attach- Table 1 - Airbag Fabric Description Manufacturer: J. P.

The cylindrical struts have large ports to enable free passage of gas from one region to another. The edges of the two fabric circles are then sewn together to complete the bag envelope, and a concentric sleeve is sewn to the front of the bag to attach to the inflator. The sleeve has a tight fit on the round inflator base and is held in place by a strap type of clamp, which is tightened around the periphery to retain the bag during inflation and impact. A half cross-sectional scale drawing of the inflated bag is shown in Fig. 6. The inflated volume is 3 ? 1710 in , and the surface area is 796 in . The diameter of an equivalent (same area) sphere is 1 5.9 in, whereas the diameter Fig. 4 - Flow porosity versus pressure drop for J. P.

A sphere having the 1710 in volume of the airbag would have a diameter of 14.2 in. A steering wheel that would prevent serious injuries to the thorax and head when impacted at velocities of 15-20 mph without airbag deployment was desired. An attempt was made to find a steering wheel that had a rim with low- durometer energy-absorbing padding, as well as a controlled, uniform load-deflection characteristic. A standard three- spoke wheel with a special soft rim covering was obtained from Sheller Globe Manufacturing Co. The soft steering wheel rim cover was not large enough in cross-sectional diameter and did not have the desired shape, but it was a good compromise considering that the cost for new molds was beyond the range of the funds available. The con- centrated force required to deflect the rim axially down the column 1 .5 in at different points around the steering wheel varied from 225-290 lb. VEHICLE MODIFICATION Modifications of the 1969 Chevrolet Impalas used in this research can be divided into three major categories: 1 . Modifications required to adapt vehicles for full-scale dynamic tests on the WHAM II and WHAM III crash simulators.* 2. Preparation of vehicles for destructive barrier crash tests on WHAM III. 3. Modifications required for the installation and correct operation of the air-bag system. The modifications for use on the crash simulators will be discussed only briefly, while those required to obtain correct operation of the airbag system will be dealt with in detail. For crash simulations, the test vehicle is subjected to the same deceleration levels prevailing in the crash being simulated and is used repetitively. It is necessary to strengthen the frame and eliminate concentrated masses such as the engine and transmission so that the remaining structure will with- stand the accelerations without damage. Structural box section weldments are added to the frame to increase the structural integrity of the vehicle. The engine, transmission, differential, and other masses not required for the study under consideration are removed, resulting in a weight re- duction to about 2000 lb. Body-to-frame attachment is reinforced by the addition of bolts and welding. For use on WHAM II, a snubber cable attachment point was welded to the aft end of the car. When the same car was adapted for use on WHAM III, additional members were added to the front of the vehicle to permit the deceleration forces to be *See Ref. 4 for descriptions of WHAM II and WHAM III.

PATRICK, ET AL. transmitted from the snubber, through the sled, to the front of the vehicle. No vehicle modifications were made for the destructive barrier crash tests except for the attachment of a tow-link beneath the car and interior changes for adapting the airbag system. In all cases, the seat was reinforced by a cross member between the B-posts, behind the seat, with attachments to the seat. In addition, the seat tracks were welded to pre- vent the seat from translating forward during deceleration. Instrumentation added to the vehicle included an ac- celerometer to record the deceleration history of the oc- cupant compartment and a velocity transducer for measuring the vehicle speed. Instrumentation cables from the dum- mies were connected to a terminal strip mounted in the rear portion of the car. The leads from the terminal strip were fed through a conduit attached to the vehicle, extending outward from the right rear portion. The cables were dragged along a cable trough and connected to the signal conditioning equipment. Two crash sensors were mounted on the firewall of the vehicle. They were wired in parallel so that either one would initiate deployment when the vehicle acceleration reached the sensor trigger level. The use of two sensors provided redundacy, and also an opportunity to compare the per- formance of two sensors under identical vehicle acceleration environments, but on separate locations on the firewall. The time of operation of both sensors was noted on the records. The major modification to the vehicle for installation of the airbag system consisted of removal of the instrument panel and replacement with a tubular structural frame to which components including the experimental knee restraint/instrument panel can be attached. The modified form is shown in Fig. 7 with the panel removed. The frame was also used to provide an attachment point for a slider- support weldment found necessary to achieve column collapse during impact with the airbag inflated. An adapter was mounted on the steering wheel hub for mounting the airbag system. Finally, the steering column angle to the horizontal was reduced to 19 deg from the original 25 deg. COLLAPSIBLE STEERING COLUMN The energy-absorbing column installed in the 1969 Chevrolet Impala used as the basic vehicle for this program was the ball type of second-generation energy-absorbing column developed by General Motors. A primary crush force is developed through the interference fit of two rings of balls located in the space between concentric tubes. Since the balls are of larger diameter than the clearance between the two concentric tubes, they form grooves in the metal of the tubes as they telescope one over the other. In addition to the force generated by the interference fit of the balls as the column collapses, there is a capsule at the instrument panel that fractures initially at a force on the steering assembly of 200-350 lb from driver impact. Simulated barrier impacts at velocities up to 40 mph failed to cause column collapse with the standard installa- tion. Analysis of the column installation and the direction of the applied force in the high-speed movies showed that failure of the column to collapse was due to the bending moment applied when the airbag was installed. In order to obtain the desired column collapse, the column angle was decreased from 25 to 19 deg and a slider support assembly was added to the top of the column, as shown in Fig. 8. It consists of a structural attachment to the tubular frame installed for mounting the instrument panel. A frame made from small structural angles is attached to the weldment and terminates in a V-shaped angle guide on top of the steering column. A second angle is clamped to the top of the column to provide a mating, sliding surface. The lubricated surfaces eliminate the large bending moment Fig. 7 - Tubular weldment for attachment of experimental airbag system components</page><page sequence="8">SHAPED STEERING ASSEMBLY AIRBAG 2945 that locked the columns under operation without the slider-support. WEIGHT ANALYSIS OF STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG SYSTEM The weight of a steering wheel airbag system is an important factor if a collapsible steering column is utilized. This importance stems from the fact that the airbag system is part of the moving mass that is accelerated by the reaction force of the airbag as it decelerates the driver and collapses the column. The force exerted by the airbag (in the direction of the column axis) is equal to the force necessary to crush the collapsible element of the column plus the inertia force associated with accelerating the moving mass of the column and other components attached thereto. Moving mass in- formation is, therefore, of obvious importance in mathematical modeling and/or establishing the appropriate quasi-static column collapse force for a steering column. A complete weight breakdown for the airbag system developed in this research program is presented in Table 2. The pressure pickup and associated parts were present in all experimental tests. However, they would not be included in a production type of installation. It can be shown using the data of Table 2 that the increase in moving mass of the steering assembly for a vehicle retrofitted with an airbag system developed in this program would be 3.57 lb, which represents an increase of approximately 21 .4%. With the airbag installed, the acceleration of the column during collapse will be much lower so the inertial force will be reduced. There is evidence that the static crush force should be increased to make better use of the crush distance in decelerating the driver. KNEE RESTRAINTS The knee is one of the best places for applying decelerating forces to the human body. A conservative value of 1400 lb for each knee has been established in FMVSS 208. A total force of 2800 lb is allowed through both knees. The importance of utilizing this as part of the deceleration mechanism can be emphasized by realizing that the total energy represented by the 50th percentile male traveling at 30 mph is approximately 4800 ft-lb. This total energy, if it could be dissipated through the knees at a constant force of 2800 lb, would require only 1.7 ft of stopping distance. While it is obvious that the total kinetic energy cannot be dissipated in this manner, the knees can and should be used as a major point for applying decelerating forces to the body.

The general requirements for the knee impact area include a deformable surface area to conform to the knee contour and to eliminate high, concentrated forces on the patella and to avoid forces in excess of the 1400 lb requirement. A sheet- metal panel without sharp edges and small radii in the impact area serves as a suitable load-distributing mechanism. With suitable backing, it can also provide the necessary force- limiting and energy-absorbing capability. Evaluation of the viable options for design of the knee impact area resulted in the conclusion that either a knee airbag or a deformable instrument panel was a logical solu- tion. The knee impact airbag was discarded as being un- necessarily complex. Previous research in knee impact in- dicates that a simple energy-absorbing panel can be fabricated at a low cost. Examination of the knee impact area in the vehicle showed that the rigid bracket for supporting the steering column complicates the instrument panel design, since the bracket is adjacent to the column in the area where the knee would normally hit. In an oblique impact, the knee will hit the steering column and panel intersection at the point where the bracket presents a rigid area. To avoid this dangerous situation, it is necessary to incorporate a fairing or deflector that will guide the knee away from the rigid bracket at impact. In future vehicle design, it is suggested that the support for the column be removed from the knee impact area and placed higher up on the panel and column. The bracket can be incorporated into the slider support. The experimental knee restraint/instrument panel shown in Fig. 9 has an easily fabricated, semicircular cross section extending farther into the passenger compartment than the standard panel to provide greater crush distance. The ad- vantages of the increased crush distance are twofold: it in- creases the energy absorption and applies a force before the occupant has moved forward as far as was necessary to strike the original panel. This keeps the occupant on the seat and controls the trajectory of the impact on the steering wheel airbag. If the driver slides forward off the seat, there is danger of injury to his back, either as he slides down or on rebound where contact with the seat causes hyperextension of the spine and possible injury. TEST DUMMIES AND INSTRUMENTATION Sierra anthropomorphic test dummies were used in this research, and included the 292-1050 50th percentile male, 292-895 95th percentile male, and 592-805 5th percentile female. Triaxial accelerometers were mounted at the head and upper torso e.g., and force transducers were inserted in the femurs. These transducers were coupled to broadband d-c bridge types of signal conditioning units and amplifiers, and the outputs were recorded on a Sangamo 3500 tape deck and Honeywell 1 508 light-beam oscillograph. Sen- sitivities were adjusted by shunt resistance calibration, and analog filters were used to conform to the requirements of FMVSS 208. High-speed cinematography was used to observe the air- bag system performance during dynamic vehicle tests. A minimum of three 16 mm cameras were used at all times, including a stationary left lateral view, stationary frontal view, and an onboard right lateral view. The stationary left lateral camera film was analyzed quantitatively as indicated in the section entitled, "High-Speed Cinematography Analysis." A typical film sequence is shown in Fig. 10.

Computer programs are used to calculate the Gadd Severity Index (SI), the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) index, and the cumulative time duration the chest acceleration is above the 60 g level. These data are calculated for each of the three orthogonal components and the resultant. HIGH-SPEED CINEMATOGRAPHY ANALYSIS A computer program is used to analyze the high-speed films to determine vehicle and occupant kinematics during full-scale dynamic vehicle tests of the airbag system. Input data for the program are obtained using a Vanguard Motion Analyzer that enables one to "track" on a target in the field-of-view and record X, Y, 6 position coordinates and angles as a function of film frame number. The analyzer is interfaced with an IBM 526 keypunch machine that prepares data cards for the computer. Computer input data consist of 14 separate measurements on each film frame, and the output consists of occupant displacements, velocities, and accelerations as a function of time, relative to the vehicle. Typical driver head, shoulder, and H-point displacement versus time curves are shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Displacements are relative to the vehicle. RESTRAINT SYSTEMS EVALUATED UNDER SIMULATED CONDITIONS Four modes of driver restraint were evaluated: 1 . Steering wheel airbag. 2. Lap and shoulder belts. 3. Lap belt only. 4. Unrestrained. Vehicle velocities ranged nominally from 15-40 mph. Air- bag experiments were conducted at nominal velocities of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mph, and the belted restraint evalua- tion included nominal velocities of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mph. Unrestrained driver experiments were conducted at nominal velocities of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 mph. A packed airbag assembly was mounted in place at the steering wheel hub for all tests. Seventy-three full-scale laboratory simulated and destructive barrier crash tests were conducted on WHAM II and WHAM III. Runs 1-35 were simulated crashes on WHAM II, and runs 36-73 were simulated crashes on WHAM III, with the exception of runs 60 and 73, which were destructive crashes. Runs 10-19 were 50% dummy belt restraint evaluations on WHAM II, and included a nondeployed airbag packed in place on the steering wheel. The remaining WHAM II runs were airbag developmental tests, as were runs 36-45 on WHAM III enabling evolution of the final design, and will not be discussed further. DESTRUCTIVE BARRIER CRASH TESTS In addition to the crash simulations, two full-scale destructive barrier crash experiments were conducted on WHAM III to evaluate the airbag system performance under actual crash conditions. Destructive crashes are performed on WHAM III by accelerating the vehicle in the usual manner, disconnecting it from the propulsion unit, and allowing it to crash into a concrete barrier located down-range from the accelerator. Two destructive crashes were made. The first was a frontal force crash in which the vehicle azimuth was perpendicular to the plane of the crash barrier, while in the second one a 30 deg left oblique barrier impact was achieved by placing a 30 deg structural steel wedge on the front of the barrier.

In both of the barrier tests, the unbelted driver was pro- tected by the steering wheel airbag and the modified in- strument panel. The right front passenger was restrained by a conventional three- or four-point harness system. Both occupants were Sierra 292-1050 50th percentile dummies with triaxial accelerometers in the head and chest and axial load transducers in the femurs. Belt load transducers re- corded the forces in the three- or four-point belt components in the passenger restraint harness. BELT RESTRAINT EXPERIMENTS The four-point lap and shoulder belt tests of runs 10-16 and the lap belt only tests of runs 17-19 were conducted to establish baselines with which the airbag system performance can be compared. Vehicle velocities and stopping distances on these belt tests ranged from 16.4 mph and 16 in to 35.3 mph and 37.5 in. The head resultant SI ranged from 33-1013 and exceeded 1000 only on run 18 (26.1 mph). The face hit the steering wheel rim on all lap belt only runs, and the head contacted the packed airbag in the higher- velo city lap and shoulder belt tests. The cumulative time duration above 60 g for the anterior-posterior (A-P) component of chest acceleration on runs 18 and 19 (26.1 and 30.6 mph, respectively) was 3.7 and 4.0 ms, respectively. The re- maining belt tests all had resultant acceleration durations above 60 g of less than 3 ms. The steering column collapse on runs 18 and 19 was 1.4 and 2.4 in, respectively. Addi- tional details regarding the above discussion are presented in Table 3, including the head to steering assembly impacts when they occurred. Peak forces in each belt component are listed in Table 4. There is a general increase in harness forces with increasing velocity, but even at 35.3 mph with lap and shoulder belts, the injury criteria established in FMVSS 208 were not ex- ceeded for the driver in the simulated collisions. At shoulder belt loop loads over approximately 1600 lb (run 13), the driver's head usually hits some part of the steering assembly, indicating a need for a steering assembly design that will minimize injury to the face and neck if the harness is used without the airbag. The simulated collision run 15 at 30.5 mph and the frontal force barrier crash run 60 at 32.2 mph permit an approximate comparison of results between the following with the same dummy type : 1 . A simulated and a destructive barrier crash. 2. Performance of three- and four-point harness. 3. Driver and passenger. The stopping distance for the simulated collision was 32 in, and the permanent crush of the barrier crash was 29 in. Addition of the elastic deformation of the vehicle should make the total stopping distance about the same for the two experiments. The stopping time for both deceleration pulses was between 1 10-120 ms. Both pulses were cyclical with 6 or 7 major cycles ranging in amplitude from about 5-25 g except for one peak. The simulated collision had one 30 g peak at 25 ms, and the barrier crash had a 50 g peak at 60 ms. A crude comparison of total restraint force for the two systems can be made by adding the peak forces in the belts, which results in 5590 lb for the barrier crash and 5580 lb for the simulated collision. These are tensile forces in the belts, which are somewhat different in geometrical configuration, so the comparison is not exact even though the values are essentially the same. Chest acceleration for the barrier crash was 55 g in the Fig. 13 - Hip and shoulder displacement versus time, DOT run 47</page><page sequence="14">SHAPED STEERING ASSEMBLY AIRBAG 295 1 A-P (front to back) direction, 18 g in the S-I (top to bottom) direction, and 43 g in the A-P and 23 g in the S-I direction for the simulated collision. The difference is probably due to the difference in geometry, impact velocity, and the usual variations between runs. The resultant chest acceleration is 56 g for the crash and 49 g for the simulation, both of which are below the maximum prescribed in FMVSS 208. The greatest difference in results between the two experi- ments falls in the SI, which for the right front passenger in the crash was 2900 and for the driver in the simulation was 689, both based on the resultant acceleration. It is surprising to find such a great difference with the passenger having a higher value, especially since the driver's head hit the steering assembly and the passenger's head hit nothing except his chest. Examination of the records and the high-speed movies provides an explanation. The SI was calculated for the three orthogonal components in addition to resultant acceleration with values of 398 A-P, 202 S-I, and 15 L-R for the driver in run 15 and 493 A-P, 2027 S-I, and 41 L-R for the passen- ger in the crash of run 60. The major factor in the difference in the resultant SI is obviously the S-I value. The chin of the dummy passenger contacted the chest at the end of the free rotation of the head, causing high forces and accelerations in the S-I direction and some increase in the A-P direction. Com- parison of the acceleration values in the three directions veri- fies this theory with the S-I peak acceleration being 48 g for the driver of run 15 and 104 g for the passenger of run 60. The A-P accelerations were almost the reverse at 104 g for the driver of run 15, and 57 for the passenger of run 60. Greater time duration for the nonimpact condition of run 60 explains the higher SI for the same peak acceleration in the two directions. SIMULATED BARRIER CRASH AIRBAG PERFORMANCE Timing of the airbag cycle is extremely important if correct performance is to be achieved. The sensor, which is designed for a particular acceleration pulse, changes the timing of the system if it is subjected to a grossly different Table 4 - Belt Loads Peak Belt Loads, lb _ Vehicle T ^ ^ , _ Run Lap T Belt ^ Shoulder ^ Belt , Velocity, No. Type mph Outboard Inboard Upper Lower 10| 16.4 660 670 - 270 11 21.0 980 1030 820 430 12 Four-point lap 19.6 830 1220 790 440 13 &gt; and shoulder 26.5 1070 1470 1010 630 14 1 belts 30.8 970 * 1190 870 15 30.5 1660 1970 1250 700 16j 35.3 1660 1870 1380 810 17] 20.8 1240 1410 18 r Lap belt only 26.1 1590 1760 I9J 30.6 1530 1930 60 ** 32.2 1520 2230 1840 *Inboard floor anchor failed. ♦♦Right front passenger, destructive barrier crash, three-point harness.

M. PATRICK, ET AL. pulse. The pulse chosen for WHAM III was estimated to be that of the vehicle for which collision simulation was under- taken. The correct stopping distance was used, and an estimate of the pulse shape was used to establish the snubber condition on WHAM III. After the barrier crash, when a true deceleration profile was available, it was found that the pulse for WHAM III was not optimum. This resulted in a delayed signal to initiate deployment of the airbag. In the vehicle crash, the sensor triggered 16 ms after the onset of vehicle deceleration. The earliest sensing on the simulation runs was 27 ms, which occurred at 35 mph. The increased time to actuate the airbag wastes part of the crush distance and/or part of the available space between the occupant and the steering wheel. At simulated impact velocities greater than 30 mph, the sensing time ranged from 27-40 ms. The true deceleration pulse resulted in faster sensing and con- sequently improved performance of the airbag. Thus, the values listed are all conservative, and better performance is to be expected in real-world crashes. Even with slow sensing, the allowable SI and HIC indexes were exceeded only on runs 52, 56, and 66 at 39.5, 34.6, and 34.3 mph, respectively, as shown in Table 5. Run 66 was conducted with the 5th percentile female dummy which always gives a higher SI and HIC than the 50th percentile male dummy. No windshields were present in these simulated collisions. In some cases, where the steering assembly crushed the full distance, the dummy head traveled far enough forward to hit the windshield, had it been present. In these runs, the head sometimes struck the header on the rebound, increasing the acceleration. This is an artifact that would not have been present with a windshield. The SI ranged from 224-528 in the ten 30 mph runs (including developmental runs), which is considerably lower than the 1000 allowed in FMVSS 208. An interesting comparison between the results of the impacts for the different sized occupants as evidenced by the SI is available in Table 5 and Fig. 14, which is a plot of the SI as a function of simulated velocity for the three dummy sizes. The 5th percentile female dummy reaches the maxi- mum allowable SI of 1000 at a velocity of about 32 mph; the 50th percentile male reaches it at about 38 mph, and the 95th percentile male would reach the 1000 level at about 39 mph if extrapolated beyond the 35 mph maximum simulated velocity. In addition to the quantitative measure of head injury as evidenced by the SI and HIC indexes, a qualitative evaluation of the impact was made from the high-speed movies. The driver's head did not strike the steering wheel rim or hub as it did during lap and shoulder belt runs over 25 mph and all of the lap belt and unbelted restraint experiments. While the force from the facial impact to the steering wheel rim or to the packed airbag is usually below that required to exceed the allowable SI, there would probably have been injury to the facial bones and soft tissue. Consequently, the airbag performance is better than expressed by the SI for the head. The chest injury criterion established in FMVSS 208 (60 g/3 ms) was exceeded only in runs 52 and 54 at 39.5 and 36.4 mph. The steering column collapse of 2.8 in for 36.4 mph in run 54 was lower than normal, as was the airbag pressure. These two factors probably contributed to the high chest loads. The specified chest criterion was met with no difficulty at the 30 mph specified in FMVSS 208. FMVSS 208 does not specify an injury criterion for the abdomen. In the unrestrained runs without the airbag, the abdomen struck the lower steering wheel rim and would probably have caused internal injuries. With the airbag, this contact is eliminated, providing better protection than evidenced simply by the evaluation of FMVSS 208 injury criteria. The greatest number of failures to meet the FMVSS 208 maximums occurred in the femur force, with 1 1 of the individual knee loads exceeding the allowable 1400 lb, as shown in Table 5. Failure to meet the specified 1400 lb limit on each knee is not considered to be serious from several standpoints. First, the 1400 lb is a very conservative limit and could probably be increased to 1800 lb or higher without causing a substantial number of injuries. Even when injuries occur from knee impact, they are seldom dangerous to life and rarely represent permanent disability. Second, the instrument panel is separate from the airbag system and can be substantially improved by tooling for uniformity and desired deceleration characteristics, which were difficult to achieve with the handmade sheet-metal and cut plastic foam. Finally, the knee loads over the allowable limit of 1400 lb, as shown in Table 5, all occurred at impact speeds greater than the 30 mph specified in FMVSS 208. The final system performs considerably better than the maximum permitted in FMVSS 208 at 30 mph, and would meet or better the injury criteria at 35 mph with the 50th percentile dummy. The 95th percentile dummy met the criteria maximums at close to 40 mph, while the 5th percentile female met them at velocities up to 32 mph. With further development to refine the design for production, it appears that the injury criteria can be met for all three dummy sizes at 35 mph, and possibly even at 40 mph. Better utilization of the column and instrument panel crush distance by in- creasing the crush force, or possibly making it velocity- sensitive, would probably improve the performance at the higher speeds. DESTRUCTIVE BARRIER CRASH AIRBAG PERFORMANCE The results of the two barrier crashes are presented in Table 6. The right front passenger in both crashes was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt combination. Results of the harnessed right front passenger in run 60 were in- cluded in the discussion of restraint systems. The 30 deg oblique impact sensor actuation time of 35 ms is far too great, indicating a need for an improved sensor. The right femur load was 1600 lb, while the left femur load was 1000 lb. This difference can probably be attributed to the right knee con- tacting the panel at the juncture of the steering column with higher forces due to the stiffening of the panel by the column</page><page sequence="16">SHAPED STEERING ASSEMBLY AIRBAG 2953 5 &lt; c o V5 0&gt; «3 ed i- i U TD C ed C/3 G O Jd 'g 6 '&lt;si M .2 PQ "3 G &lt;L&gt; e n o a X w M Î g a&gt; 0Í («H O fr ed £ Ē G C/D V) JD 3 ed H 3 O, e ä 5 .3 CC G CC Sdu-S O O O - OO «_&lt;uC -o -g - •© ^ o *n o ed ed « ed eded i-h £ q.

M. PATRICK, ET AL. bracket. The SI was 1274 for the oblique impact, compared with 460 for the frontal force impact. The increase in head SI is attributed to the head hitting the windshield, and probably the header, to the left of the normal driver center- line during the impact. The chest accelerations were lower for the 30 deg impact than for the frontal force impact for the airbag-protected driver. For the frontal force barrier impact, the resultant SI for the driver was 460. The chest accelerations were well under the 60 g/3 ms level, and the left femur force was 1 1 50 lb. The only injury criterion exceeded was the right femur force, which reached a peak force of 1450 lb. This femur force would probably have been less than the allowable 1400 lb if the velocity had been 30 mph. Also, elimination of impact to instrument panel at the steering column attach- ment bracket, which locally stiffens the panel, would un- doubtedly lead to lower femur loads. ANALYSIS OF 35 MPH BARRIER CRASH SIMULATIONS Special emphasis was placed on providing airbag protection at velocities greater than 30 mph in this program. Simula- tions up to 40 mph were made, but the injury criteria could not be met at 40 mph. Therefore, analysis of four runs at a nominal 35 mph will be the basis for evaluating this system at the highest practical velocity. With additional develop- ment, it is expected that this velocity can be increased to 40 mph. Head protection is the most critical item in the system, both from the standpoint of the number and severity of injuries to vehicle occupants and the difficulty in achieving protection. Fig. 15 presents the resultant head acceleration as a function of time during the simulated collisions. Runs 46, 55, 58, and 59 are all plotted to the same scale. The heavy black line represents the average of the four accelera- tions at any given time. The curves all have the same general shape with some variation in timing (the curves were placed on the scale to provide the same initial starting point), but a greater variation in acceleration for any given time.

To compare the A-P accelerations, Fig. 16 was drawn from the same set of runs utilizing the same technique for finding the average. Again, the curve has the same general geometrical shape with about the same percentage of spread. In Fig. 17, the SI is plotted along with the average index as a function of time. The curves all have the same general shape with a substantial deviation from run to run. The average SI for the four runs is 550, with a range from 415- 630. A graphic presentation of the movement of the occupant and steering wheel is presented in Fig. 18 for run 59, which is closest to the average of the four runs based on SI. The data for this curve were obtained from film analysis. The point of reference is taken as the center of the steering wheel, and is a point that remains fixed to the vehicle even when the steering assembly moves. A point at the same vertical height as the reference point at the anterior of the dummy chest is also plotted as a function of time. The difference in these curves represented by the ordinate on the graph is the dis- tance between the chest and the reference point at the steering wheel. When the column collapses, the distance between the chest and the steering wheel is the difference between the curves marked "center of hub" and "anterior of chest." For convenience, the distance between the reference points on the hub and chest is plotted. The total column collapse is the difference between the center of the hub and the reference point at the steering wheel. For this run, the total column collapse was 7.9 in. The time is referenced to initial vehicle deceleration. The time at which the sensor actuated and the time of column collapse initiation are also indicated. All distances are horizontal components. At time zero, the anterior of the chest is at - 13 in, or 13 in behind the reference point at the center, or the rear plane of the steering wheel. The total vehicle crush of 36 in is represented by the maximum horizontal displacement forward of the reference point in the vehicle, and is so indicated on the graph. COMPARISON OF RESTRAINT SYSTEMS A comparison of no restraint, lap belt only, lap and shoulder belts, and the airbag gives a good perspective of the currently available safety features. The remarks will be restricted to forward force destructive and simulated barrier crashes, since these were of primary interest in this program. With no belt or airbag restraint, the injury criteria were not exceeded at impacts up to 25 mph; however, the abdomen and facial impacts would probably have produced serious injuries at this speed. Therefore, the maximum safe speed for no restraint condition with this steering assembly is considered to be 20 mph. With the lap belt only, the chest accelerations were excessive at 26 mph and marginal at 20.8 mph. In fact, the chest accelerations were higher for the same impact speed with the lap belt only than with no restraint.

M. PATRICK, ET AL. due to the guiding effect of the lap belt, which causes the chest to strike the steering wheel hub in a direction perpendicular to the column axis, rather than the abdomen striking first as it does in the unrestrained case. The injury criteria do not consider abdominal and facial impacts; there- fore, the unrestrained condition looks better than the lap belt only. Based on these data, the maximum acceptable velocity for the lap belt only is also 20 mph. The lap and shoulder belt combination was well within the allowable levels at velocities up to 35 mph, except for the barrier crash in which the passenger head SI was 2900. How- ever, at velocities of 25 mph and over, the head did hit the packed airbag. In those cases, the SI was not excessive, indicating that the force was not high enough to cause brain damage. The harness had decelerated the head to a point where injury would probably have been minimal. Also, impact to a padded hub is preferable to impacting the steer- ing wheel rim, which provides concentrated loads to the face with danger of facial bone fracture. According to the injury criteria, the other limiting factor would be the 2900 SI for the right front passenger in the 32.2 mph frontal destructive barrier crash. However, as pointed out earlier, the majority of the SI was due to a large S-I acceleration component, which apparently did not cause injury in the field. Based on these data, the limiting velocity for the lap and shoulder belt would be 25 mph if the SI is considered, or greater than 35 mph if the SI is eliminated when the head does not hit an interior component or hits a noninjury -producing component such as a well-padded and force-controlled steering wheel hub. The airbag system developed under this program appears to be safe at velocities up to 35 mph. With further develop- ment, it could probably meet a 40 mph requirement without exceeding the injury criteria. The airbag has the big advantage of not permitting the face or abdomen to strike the steering wheel rim or hub. Thus, the potential injuries to the abdomen and facial bones are greatly reduced in the case of the airbag, while in the other restraint systems these components present very real dangers. On the negative side, for the airbag there are little data available on the performance when the occupants are out of position. Also, the harness or lap belt holds the driver in position, thereby lessening likelihood of losing vehicle control during severe operating conditions. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions are based on the forward force simulated and destructive barrier crashes of this program: 1 . With the modified steering assembly, the driver can withstand a 20 mph collision unrestrained, without exceeding the FMVSS 208 injury criteria. The abdomen and face hit the steering assembly, but with correct design, the injuries to these areas will probably not be excessive. 2. With the lap belt only, the limiting velocity is also 20 mph. The lap belt causes the occupant to jacknife so that the chest strikes the steering assembly in a normal direction (perpendicular to the column axis), resulting in a force on the chest higher than without restraint, as evidenced by the higher accelerations. 3. With a lap and shoulder belt, the driver is protected at velocities up to 25 mph without striking the steering assembly, and also, with the head striking the steering assembly, at velocities up to 35 mph, which was the highest velocity used in this program with a lap and shoulder harness. The FMVSS 208 injury criteria were not exceeded for the driver, even though the head struck the packed airbag. The velocity of this head impact was low and the injury criterion was not exceeded. If the head injury criterion is eliminated, except for that portion of the impact during which the head strikes an interior component, the allowable velocity will be at least 35 mph. No experimental results are available for higher velocities. 4. Injury criteria were not exceeded with the airbag for simulated velocities up to 30 mph. With some further development, it is expected that 40 mph barrier equivalent can be withstood without exceeding the injury criteria. 5. For a given impact condition, the airbag appears to offer the best protection based upon established injury criteria and high-speed film analysis. The head and abdomen do not strike the steering wheel with the airbag, while with the other restraints or no restraint, one or both strike the steering assembly with possible injury. 6. Additional injury criteria should be established to include danger of injury or fracture to the facial bones, neck, and abdomen. 7. The knee impact area of the instrument panel is critical and should be considered an important part of any airbag system design. It is desirable to have the instrument panel impact provide force near the allowable 1400 lb. 8. The shaped airbag deploys between the abdomen and the steering wheel and between the head and steering wheel. Careful analysis of the high-speed movies shows that pro- tection for these two areas is provided. 9. It is important that the column collapses to provide the protection afforded by the nearly 8 in displacement available during the forward motion of the steering assembly. 10. The injury criteria as measured by the head and chest accelerations and femur force vary inversely with the oc- cupant size. With the airbag system developed under this program, the 5th percentile female reaches the maximum injury criterion at about 32 mph, the 50th percentile male reaches it at about 37 mph, and the 95th percentile male reaches it at about 39 mph.
