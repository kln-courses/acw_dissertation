Scared by the imminence of Death, man sometimes wishes that he had not been created at all; but having been created, he has no choice other than to accept Death as the price to be paid for living. Now it is up to him to ignore it so as to be able to enjoy the little time he has to spend on earth; he should then pay the price when it is due. Alternatively, he may want to challenge Death and try to neutralize its power. This, of course, is taking a big risk. But to succeed is to live foreever. The Yoruba of south-western Nigeria have succeeded in neutralizing the power of Death, using art as a weapon. They now enjoy immortality. One of the stories of their encounter with Death goes like this: Long, long ago, Death (ikui) and his followers regularly invaded Ife. Every fourth day they came from heaven to OjaifO market where they killed as many people as they could with the staffs that Death had given them. Eventually, most of the people of Ife were destroyed, and those who remained cried to Lafogido who was then Qni and to Odua, Orisanla, Orisa Ijugbe, Oriis Alase, and all the obfa to save them But the brifa could do nothing to drive these spirits away. Finally Amaiyegun promised to save them. He brought coloured cloths which he sewed into a costume which completely covered his body. The arms of the costume were like gloves to fit his fingers, and the legs of the costume like gloves to fit his toes. He sacrificed a ram, a cock and three whips (ifin) in making the costume. Then he called the people to him. First he put his left foot into the leg of the costume, which came up to the knee. Then he showed it to the people and they began to sing: 'Come and see the foot, a fine secret' (e wd w'fsa awo rebeterebete). He put his right leg into the costume and extended it so that the people could see. They sang the song again. He put his left arm and then his right arm into the costume. Each time . .. (the people sang): 'Come and see the hand, a fine secret' (e wd w'Qw4 awo rebeterebete). Finally he put on the gown which covered his face and his entire body. He took off the costume and stored it away in his room. When he found that Death would come again the next day, he went to the Qni and promised he would save the people on the morrow. In the morning ... (Amaiyegun) and his followers, who did not wear costumes, went to Qjaif~ market and hid in the buttresses of the large trees. Soon the townspeople began to come to the market, and not long afterwards Death and his followers descended on them, killing them with their</page><page sequence="2">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA staffs. Amaiyegun came out from his hiding place, crying in the low gutteral voice of Egungun 'khaa, khoo'. Death and his followers dropped their staffs and fled in terror. Amaiyeguti and his followers picked up the staffs and pursued them. As they overtook them, they struck them on the head. 'Gba!', one fell; 'Gba !', another fell. Since that time Death and his followers have never returned to Ife (Bascom, 1944: 56). In other words, man conquered Death with a mask. To understand the full implications of this myth, and the extent to which art has been used to achieve immortality, it is necessary to know the Yoruba concepts of man as well as Death. According to Yoruba ontology, when the Supreme Being, Olo6dmare, decided to create man, he asked one of the gods, known as Qbatala, to mould man's physical body from clay. And after Qb(atala had created the image, Olo6dumare breathed life (cmi) into it (Abimbola, 1971: 76-9), so that man is a sort of sculpture animated by the breath of Olodumare. The sculpture remains alive as long as the vital breath or what might also be called the soul dwells in it. Withdrawal or loss of the soul results in death; the physical body (ara) becomes static, and, when buried, decomposes into clay, which it was originally. However, to the Yoruba, death is not the end of life. It is merely a dematerialization of the vital breath or soul, and hence a transformation from earthly to spiritual existence (a kind of After-Life), where the dematerialized soul may choose to stay forever, although it can make periodic returns to earth through reincarnation (at;nwa). It is this belief in an After-Life and in Reincarnation that assures the Yoruba of immortality. There are two types of reincarnation for the Yoruba. One occurs when a dead ancestor is believed to have been reborn in the same family: The ancestor reborn in the child may be identified through physical resemblance, similarity in character or behavior, through dreams in which the ancestor tells someone in the family that he has returned, or through divination for the mother during pregnancy, or for the newborn child (Bascom, 1960: 404). Such children are called Babtuinde (Father comes again) or Yetunde (Mother comes back) if they are of the same sex as a recently deceased relation. In these instances, the soul of the dead is believed to have returned to earth to start a new life in a new physical body. In fact, some Yoruba address such children like their deceased parents (Awolalu, 970: 35). In the second type of reincarnation, it is the soul of a group of spirit children known as abiki ('born to die') which steals into the womb of a pregnant woman, and is born in what might be called a 'borrowed' body. Of course, the disguised soul of abiku is only visiting the earth as a sort of tourist; for it will soon desert the 'borrowed' body in order to return to its unborn companions. Thus a woman who has lost several children in a row is regarded as being troubled by the spirit of abiku; it is the same soul that has been 'going and coming back' in different sexual guises (Molade, I973: 62-4; Morton- Williams, 1960: 34-40). However, the important thing to note about the Yoruba notion of reincarnation is the extent to which it has led them to equate the human body with sculpture, and to 5 I</page><page sequence="3">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA regard it as no more than the mask of temporal existence. Both the reincarnated ancestor and the abiku are simply masqueraders. At death, it is this temporal mask, the handiwork of Qbiatala, that will perish; the human soul will not, being a part of the breath of Ol6duimare who is known as Oyigiyigi, Ota Aiki--the mighty rock of immortality (Idowui, I962: 43). The corollary of this symbolic equation of the human body with man-made sculpture is the belief that the latter can also localize the human soul. Thus, in the rituals of figidi, a clay or wooden effigy of an enemy is made with the purpose of injuring him through it. Ideally, the effigy should have some physical resemblance to the enemy, even if in a miniature or symbolic form. But physical resemblance can easily be substituted by merely using the name of the enemy to call the effigy. In any case, physical resemblance or the name is meant to identify the effigy with the body of the enemy. The final stage of the ritual involves inviting the soul of the enemy into the effigy and then destroying the latter. The destruction of the effigy is expected to cause some neuro-physical damage in the body of the enemy which may eventually lead to his death. This is why naturalistic representation of a living person is considered to be very dangerous, as it makes the person vulnerable to evil magic. Even nowadays, a Yoruba will warn a photographer not to give copies of his photograph to unknown persons or, more specifically, his rivals. A good number of the naturalistic representations in Yoruba art serve in a funerary context. For instance, a few days or weeks after the corpse has been interred, there is a second-burial ceremony. A naturalistic life-size effigy of the deceased is made; it is then dressed in the finest clothes of the deceased and paraded round the town, and finally buried like a corpse (Willett, 1966: 34-45; AbiPdun, 1976). Alternatively, one of the children of the deceased who resembles him closely may be dressed in the best clothes of the deceased (regardless of whether they are over-size). The human surrogate is then led in a procession round the town. If the deceased was a chief, the human surrogate will be greeted and addressed like a chief. However, the human surrogate is not buried like the wooden effigy. Nowadays, if no suitable substitute is found, an enlarged photograph may be used. At the second-burial ceremony of a hunter (known as ipdd or ajee), a naturalistic effigy of the deceased is made (see P1. I); and where this cannot be called an exact portrait, resemblance is symbolically achieved by clothing the effigy in the best dress or hunting smock of the deceased. The effigy is paraded round the town and thereafter taken to the bush along with a basket containing the hunting charms of the deceased. After the final rites have been performed, the effigy is either destroyed with gunshots or simply left to perish.2 This marks the end of the physical existence of the deceased. In other parts of Yorubaland, the second-burial obsequy may be replaced by the ijekh or ipeki (i.e. calling the dead) ceremony during which a masked figure, wearing the dress and hat of the deceased, and walking and talking like him, is made to return to his old home to give the last farewell: He embraces all his children, sits them by turns on his knees, and blesses them, promising to bestow health, strength, long life and the rest.3 One of the most sensational ifSekz ceremonies has been recorded by Chief Delano: 52</page><page sequence="4">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA PL. I. Front and side view of an ipddf for Chief Akinyemi of Osogin Compound, Ile-Ife. Collected by the Nigerian Museum in I964. The effigy, about two-thirds life-size, was formerly clad in one of the best clothes of the deceased and installed in the bush. The figure is about 3 ft. high. Only the head and neck are carved, while the trunk is left as a rough cylinder. The missing arms were indicated by a long stick nailed to the back. A clothed ipdd is illustrated in Willett, 1965, figs. 2 and 3. Photo by E. Atejioye. All of a sudden, the crowd swayed and somebody shouted: 'He is coming!' ... And at that moment there was a solemnity that was almost indescribable. Dead silence. The man came slowly. He was, in very truth, the man who had departed 53</page><page sequence="5">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA this life just forty days ago .... His face was not covered. It must have been success- fully painted, for wrinkles and scars were all there as evidence of identity (Delan0, 1937: Ii5-I6). The mask worn by the impersonator must have been extremely naturalistic; and the description reminds us of the naturalistic bronze and terracotta heads of Ife some of which, conceivably, might have served in a similar or second-burial context.4 At any rate, in the Yoruba view, not until all the funeral rites have been performed will the soul of the deceased be able to proceed to heaven. For the first few days or weeks, the soul of the deceased lurks around his former premises, and may even stand apart to watch all the burial and funeral rites (Ido6w, 1962: 192; OgunbQwale, 1966: 5 7). A glorious funeral will no doubt encourage the deceased to use his spiritual power to help his children and relatives, while a poor funeral may have serious consequences for his children. On the other hand, failure to complete all the funeral rites will delay his departure to heaven; he will then be forced to wander about the earth, constituting a menace to the living. By and large, the use of a naturalistic mask or effigy during the second-burial ceremonies is not only to mark the last physical appearance of a departing soul on earth, but also to demonstrate that he has 'changed position' (pa ipb da), and to impress upon the soul of the deceased-if he is watching the ceremony-that, having cast off his earthly mask, he must now proceed to heaven to join the souls of his predecessors and to team up with them to help the living. The destruction or burial of his effigy implies that, like the slough of a snake, his erstwhile mask can never be re-used. However, the departing soul may want to return to the living in a new mask; he may do this either by reincarnating in any of his grandchildren, or through an egungun mask which his children will make for him. In order to be able to harness the power of the departing soul for the benefit of the living, the Yoruba may build a shrine to him. Since it is expected to localize the soul whose exact form is an unknown quantity, the altar sculpture is often stylized (see P1. II). The sculpture resembles a human being only insofar as it hints at the human essence of the soul, rather than physical reality. Frequently, the head is emphasized to communicate its physical and spiritual lordship over all the other members of the body. Apart from the fact that it contains the brain, the eyes, the nose, the mouth and the ears-all of which are vital to physical existence, the head is regarded by the Yoruba as the essence of human personality, the seat of the soul and the controller of a man's destiny (Abimblai, I97I, passim). At the moment of invocation, the soul of the dead will imperceptibly inhabit the altar sculpture to receive sacrifices and to bless the living. In this way, man-made sculpture functions as a mask through which the dead interact with the living. This mask demarcates the empirical from the metempirical, the world of physical action from that of metaphysical activity, where the power of death comes to naught because it can only operate at the physical level. It is at this point that the myth of Amaiyegun's victory over Death becomes more meaningful. Death and his followers (that is to say, diseases and environmental hazards) succeeded in killing the people of Qjaife market at the physical level. The citing of this incident in the market is very important in view of the Yoruba proverb: 'A4yelja'--which means 'the physical world is a market'. The 54</page><page sequence="6">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA 55 victory of Amaiyegun, on the other hand, can be situated in the After-Life (JUhin-Iwa), where the human soul is indestructible, especially now that it is in a transcendental state. It is this belief in the indestructibility of the soul as well as its reinforced power in the After-Life that has led the Yoruba to elevate the souls of certain ancestors or PL. II.

Elufowoju.</page><page sequence="7">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA culture-heroes to the ranks of the gods, so that their worship is now the concern of a whole community, rather than the exclusive affair of their direct descendants. Thus while the veneration of certain family ancestors has ceased as a result of the decimation of whole families by war or other hazards, the worship of culture-heroes such as $ang6 (the thunder god), Ogin (the war god) and Erinl' (a river god) has survived through several centuries to the present day. In many of the myths, a good majority of these culture-heroes did not die in what has now become the normal way; they either walked through a cave into heaven or simply turned to stone sculptures.5 Be that as it may, the fact that many of the gods are no more than deified ancestors seems to be responsible for the prominence of anthropomorphic sculptures on their altars, even when the gods themselves may sometimes not be represented in person but by non-figurative symbols, like the thunderbolt in the case of $ang6 (Lawal, 1974: 224-5). Nevertheless, it is through these symbols or sculptural representations as well as the myths that the gods live on in the mind of their worshippers or descendants. It is only the Supreme Being, Ol6dumare, who is never, or, rather, who cannot adequately be represented in person because of his spatial extensiveness. For while the souls of the gods and man are no more than entities, even though they ultimately derive from Ol6diumare, the latter is the sum-total of existence, a whole. Hence he is known as At&amp;re k'diye--'He who spreads over'.6 In fact, some Yoruba go to the extent of equating him with the very air we breathe just to show that he is inexhaustible. The living presence of dead ancestors is often dramatized in the person of the Yoruba Qba (king) who is regarded as ekeji brica, the deputy of the gods. If an Qba 'changes position', it is forbidden to say in public that he is dead. Euphemistically, he is said to have 'climbed into the roof', that is, to have joined the ranks of the ancestors. When appearing in public, the Qba usually wears a beaded crown with fringes which veil his face from the public. However, most crowns have a stylized face in the front, which then serves as a sort of substitute for the real face of the Qba. In other words, the crown de-personalizes the living king to emphasize the eternal values of divine kingship. The face on the front of the crown, being generic and having identified all the past kings in public, communicates the continuity of kingship-'a synthesis of the world of the dead and the world of the living-the king as a living ancestor' (Thompson, 970: i6). The Qba is immortal. The belief that sculpture can represent the living dead is perhaps most manifest in the twin statuettes known as ere ibeji (see P1. III). Although they are physically double, twins are regarded as spiritually one, that is, sharing only one soul between them.7 Thus if one of them should die, a statuette is made to house its 'half soul'; otherwise, the other half in the surviving twin may want to 'leave' to join its partner. In acknowledgement of the presence of the 'half-soul' in the statuette, it is treated like a living child; it is symbolically fed and bathed at the same time as the surviving twin. They both wear identical clothes. Since these symbolic gestures are also aimed at convincing the surviving twin that its partner is still around, they may be stopped when the child comes of age and no longer asks about the whereabouts of its partner. The statuette may then be placed in the family shrine under the tutelage of the gods. However, there are instances when the surviving twin has become so involved with the statuette of her deceased partner that she will continue the symbolic gestures right into adulthood. At times, the psychological bond is so intense that the surviving 56</page><page sequence="8">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA PL. III. Ere Ibeji representing dead twins (University of Ife Museum Collection). Photo by the author. adult twin will not do anything major without first informing the statuette. In the event of both twins dying, two statuettes are made and are treated like living children, with the hope that they will soon return to the same mother, either singly or as a pair, and that their soul will continue to protect her. To lose two children at a blow, or one after the other, can be more than a traumatic experience for a woman in a culture such as that of the Yoruba which places a high premium on having many children, and which views children as guaranteeing immortality. However, the belief that the soul of the departed twins still lives on in the statuettes offers some solace to the bereaved mother. In the Yoruba view, to have once had a child is a shade better than not being able to have any at all. And for a woman who has passed the age of childbearing, the statuettes must remain her 'living' children. Certainly the most dramatic demonstration of the concept of the 'Living Dead' among the Yoruba is to be found in the egungun mask (see P1. IV). It is through his mask that the soul of a departed ancestor returns to earth in a physical form to inquire about the welfare of his living descendants. Apart from the myth cited earlier which attributes the origin of the egungun costume to Amaiyegun, there are many other legends which tell divergent stories about the origin of this phenomenon. Some hold that the costume was first used to bring an abandoned corpse from the bush into the town under the pretext that it was the spirit of the dead that had returned; others claim that the first egungun were heavenly beings (Saiyegun) sent by Olo6dumar to help stabilize the earth at a period when it threatened to collapse. Some of the more historical legends claim that the Yoruba borrowed the egungun from the Nupe, their northern neighbours, who had once used the mask to terrorize them. Nevertheless, 57</page><page sequence="9">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA almost all the legends emphasize the use of the egungun to impersonate heavenly beings.8 In the image of egungun, the Yoruba celebrate the triumph of the human spirit over Death. The annual eguinguin is a time of rejoicing, and the renewal of old ties with the ancestors who are now back physically, though incognito, among the living, blessing the PL. IV.

As the word of the ancestor is law, some egungun serve as judges, helping to settle outstanding disputes in the family or the community, while others participate in rituals aimed at cleansing the community of witchcraft and disease, as well as promoting the spiritual well-being of the society in general. There is a category of egungun which entertains the living, performing tricks and satires. The actual presence of the dead among the living provides a psychological boost for the community: the young are so thrilled at the prospect of immortality that they sometimes whip one another almost to the point of severe injury, while the old, especially those in the evening of life, may occasionally be so moved by the spectacle that they soon begin to imagine the time when their own egungun would be welcomed with the same pomp and pageantry. For the egungun is a dream-come-true to the Yoruba, a dramatization of their belief in an After-Life and in the strong bond between the living and the dead. A typical Yoruba 'extended' family comprises not only the living members but also the departed ones. To the Yoruba, the Dead are not dead; but will soon be back, either as grandchildren or as egungzn. During the egungin festival, there is a great variety of costumes and masks. Some are made of coloured applique cloth or leather with a wooden mask on top. Others are merely tent-like costumes, without a wooden mask; the top-piece may be a tray displaying charms and animal bones and skulls. In actual fact, many people are aware that a human being is under the mask. Yet there is the belief that the rituals which the masquerader must undergo before putting on the mask have de-personalized him, converting him into a sort of sculptural medium (or human receptacle) for the soul of the visiting ancestor. Consequently, the masquerader is a mask within a mask; he is no longer himself and cannot be held personally responsible for any of his actions, which, at times, may include the execution of criminals and witches. To accord with his other- worldly aspect, the masquerader speaks in a gutteral voice. His identity is kept a secret. Although an egingzn may be identified with or named after a particular ancestor, the wooden mask does not attempt to recapture individual resemblance, which is a function of his historical existence, and which has been cast away during his burial ceremonies. Here, the stylization of the human face is evocative of a transformation from historical individuality to eternal humanity. The voluminous costume of the egungun conceals the unknowable and yet reveals man's infinite potential for spiritual transformation. Since the human soul is part of the breath of Ol6duimare, it antedates the creation of the human body by Qbataila. Man's earthly existence is therefore a temporal manifestation of the eternal spirit of Olo6dmare, 'the mighty rock of immortality'. Man's earthly existence began as a sculpture created by Qbatala, and it ends with the burial of that sculpture. On the altar of the ancestor, a new sculpture may be placed to provide a transient abode for the de-materialized soul, especially when it is invoked. The stylization of the new sculpture almost to embryonic proportions communicates a return to primordial spirituality. And unlike the naturalistic sculptures of the second- burial ceremonies, which have individualized features, the sculptures on ancestral altars as well as the wooden masks of the egungun tend to have stereotyped features, suggesting the spiritual oneness of man-a mask of human unity against Death. 59</page><page sequence="11">ART AND IMMORTALITY AMONG THE YORUBA NOTES I Revised form of a public lecture first given at the Fogg Art Museum, USA, sponsored by the Departments of Fine Arts and Anthropology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 22, 1975.

LES Yoruba ont contrecarre la peur de la mort grace a leur croyance en une vie future. Selon leur mythologie, l'existence de l'homme est envisagee comme la combinaison d'ara (le corps) faconne dans l'argile par Qbatala (le dieu createur) et d'jmi (l'ame) insuffle dans le corps par Ol6dumare (le Dieu Supreme), pour lui donner vie. Le corps humain est donc une sorte de sculpture animee par le souffle de Olo6dmare. Lorsque l'individu meurt, seul l'ara perit; par contre, l'kti survit puisqu'il est lui-meme un aspect de Ol6dumare qui est immortel. En d'autres termes, la mort equivaut a une dematerialisation de l'ame: c'est le passage d'une existence materielle a une existence spirituelle que l'ame, debarrassee du corps, peut choisir d'assumer pour toujours, bien qu'elle puisse de temps en temps evenir sur terre par la biais de la reincarnation (atutnwd). Cette croyance qui assimile le corps humain a une sculpture qui est l'ceuvre de Qbatala a conduit les Yoruba a assimiler le corps aux sculptures realisees par l'homme et qui pour cette raison servent aussi a localiser l'ame; on tente toutefpis de differencier les sculptures qui ont trait a l'existence physique de l'homme et celles qui se rapportent a son etat 'posthume' ou spirituel. Les sculptures naturalistes representent cet etat materiel de l'homme tandis que celles qui symbolisent sa condition spirituelle sont stylisees. Dans les sculptures naturalistes, reservees en general pour les ceremonies de seconde inhumation, l'accent est mis sur le caractere individuel et historique. Par contre, les sculptures stylisees qui servent principalement a localiser ou a invoquer l'esprit du defunt, cherchant a suggerer un etat de dematerialisation dans lequel l'esprit du defunt continue d'exister. 6i</page></plain_text>
