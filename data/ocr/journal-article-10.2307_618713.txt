<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRATAPADITYA PAL (comp.): Light of Asia: Buddha Sakyamuni in Asian art. 331 pp. Los Angeles: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, [1984]. (Distributed by University of Washington Press.) This catalogue was published in conjunction with an exhibition held 1984/85 for successive three-monthly periods at the Los Angeles Country Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Brooklyn Museum. The cata- logue is divided into four sections. Section 1 deals with the legendary accounts of Sakyamuni's life, without adhering to any par- ticular Buddhist tradition and without making any distinction as to which account belongs to which religious sect. The second part describes the eight great miracles, meaning the eight places of pilgrimage, which constitute the chief events of Sakyamuni's life. The third part deals with the narrative of his life as represented in art. Section 2 presents the basic symbols which were employed in early Buddhist art to represent Sakyamuni before he was given an anthropomorphic form by the Gandhara and Mathura schools. Section 3 describes the development of gSkyamuni's image in India, Sri Lanka and South East Asia (by Robert L. Power), China (by George Kuwayama), Korea (by Robert E. Fisher), and Japan (by Amy G. Poster). Tibet and Central Asia were not dealt with separately, but there is a small section on Central Asia included in the essay on China. Pal is otherwise the chief author of the text, although the captions to the illustrations were written by all the contributors and most are initialled by their author. The majority of the illustrations are identified, some it must be said, wrongly, some are described as fair guesses, and some remain unidentified. The text is written in an easy readable form, with plenty of anecdotal description and speculation. Of all the essays, that on China stands out as the most informative and accurate and that on Korea is a close second. Sri Lanka and South- East Asia are generally well covered, although the text at times strays into vagueness and it deals mainly with the Buddha images and their styles, less so with historical developments. The essay on Japan is incomplete and rather unbalanced, as it deals chiefly with the Pure Land and Zen schools. Other schools are men- tioned, but their historical and cultural import- ance is not discussed. Pal was not only the main author and the chief organizer of the exhibition, but also took responsibility for the overall presentation of the life of Sakyamuni and the various interpreta- tions of his identity. It is amply evident from his writing that Pal is well acquainted with Buddh- ist literature and art. His knowledge is impress- ive, although one must add that many of his interpretations of the fundamental Buddhist issues are simply incorrect or provide mislead- ing information. To substantiate this statement, here are a few examples. On page 18 we read: '... despite the fact that, unlike Christ, Sakyamuni had never asserted his own divinity, he was considered a divine and transcendental figure even before the beginning of the Christian Era.' It is confusing and unnecessary to relate Christianity to Buddhism in such a loose manner. In fact neither Christ nor Sakyamuni made such claims. gakyamuni had no reason to claim to be divine: how could he, within a totally different culture and mode of thought? But he did consider himself to be Buddha and Tathagata. Obviously he made statements about his nature which without any doubt indicated that he was not of this world (= Buddhist samsdra) but belonged to a totally different and superior order. On page 47 it is said: 'The eight great miracles were frequently represented as a dis- tinct group in art, especially in Bihar in India and in Nepal. Tibetan Buddhists disagree with this list somewhat, believing in twelve, rather than eight, significant miracles.' Here it is obvious that Pal confuses different issues and demonstrates that he is not at home with the life of gakyamuni, the chief aim of the exhibition. The Buddhist tradition has created standard sets of Sakyamuni's life. Thus we have the four most important events of his life: birth, enlightenment, first sermon, and parinirvana. Next we have the eight major events of his life: the four above plus the miracle of multiplication in the Jetavana grove at gravasti, manifestation and descent from heaven at Kanyakubja, fore- telling of his own death at Vaisall, and Rajagrha, where he proclaimed many teachings and tamed a mad elephant. In all these eight places stupas were built and they became places of pilgrimage. Later Buddhist tradition created parallel sets of eight: eight mahisrdvakas, eight Pratyekabuddhas, eight bodhi trees, eight Bud- dhas, etc. Thirdly, we have the twelve acts of the Buddha: descent from the Tusita Heaven, enter- ing the womb, birth, learning and skilfulness in arts, life in the palace, abandonment of the palace life, practice of austerities, approach to the place of enlightenment, defeat of Mara, enlightenment, proclamation of Dharma, and passing into nirvana. The twelve acts of the Buddha are frequently referred to in Buddhist literature. It is a stereotyped set and not a disagreement introduced by the Tibetans. There is an entry in Pal's bibliography entitled 'The Twelve Deeds of the Buddha,' but Pal does not seem to know about the twelve acts of the Buddha and presents the chief events of gakyamuni's life as eight. If he knew how to relate the eight events to the twelve acts of the Buddha, he would certainly have interpreted the Tibetan painted scroll on page 67 correctly and with confidence, which he does not. On page 131 we read 'The reason for the early Buddhists' avoidance of anthropomorphic representations of Buddha Sakyamuni remains a mystery.' So far as I can see it is not a mystery at all. Sakyamuni achieved the absolute state of purity and wisdom. His skandhas were purified and the samtdna of his earthly life came to an end. Once he passed into nirvana there was nothing left of him that could continue on this earth. That is why the stupa, symbol of passing into nirvana, became at once a symbol and a place of pilgrimage. On page 255 we read: '... only one Buddha of the future is named in texts ... The future Buddha is Maitreya ...'. This is not true; the Buddhist texts contain many names of future Buddhas. Thus for instance, the Mahdvastu 162 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS mentions Simha who will appear after Maitreya. Meru is another future Buddha mentioned in the same work. The Sad- dharmapundarika talks of Silendraraja, Rasmiprabhasa. The Lalitavistara tells us of Madhusambha and others, and there are several future Buddhas mentioned in the Gandavyaha. There are many more mistakes and mistate- ments which might be mentioned but perhaps enough has been said to warn a serious reader that this catalogue, beautiful pictures apart, should not be relied upon without checking the evidence against reliable sources. If it was writ- ten for the general public, then admittedly, the catalogue provides a certain amount of well- organized general information, although why it should contain basic mistatements and incor- rect information is puzzling. If it was written for the world of art historians then one must pity the standards of the profession. TADEUSZ SKORUPSKI DAVID MORGAN: The Mongols. (The peoples of Europe.) xv, 238pp. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986. Â£14.95. The Mongols, as Dr. Morgan reminds us in the first sentence of the introduction to his book, perhaps in preemptive self-defence, 'are not very obviously " a people of Europe " '. In a historical sense, though, they were, for a while, very much a people in Europe, and if we take account of the Kalmuck Mongols, today once again tucked away in their autonomous republic on the lower reaches of the Volga, they still are, if only marginally. So there is a recognizable place for this book in the series in which it has appeared. For another reason, too, one can only be pleased to find so competently written and so authoritative a book allowed a place in a series whose general title, were one inclined to carp, might seem to disqualify it. For one reason or another the Mongols, who some seven centuries ago established what the blurb on the dust jacket of this book rightly calls ' the largest continuous land empire known to history', have aroused comparatively little academic or general curiosity in western Europe. Whether it was because the Mongol invasions happened far away in the eastern part of the continent, or because the Mongols with- drew almost as quickly as they had come, or for other reasons, the Mongols never made much of a mark in the historical consciousness of western Europe. Some comprehensive, and, as Morgan suggests, by now perhaps hardly ever read, general histories, such as those by d'Ohsson and Howorth, lurk on library shelves. There are one or two good modern surveys, including the very readable and generally accu- rate History of the Mongol conquests by J. J. Saunders, and some good and less good lives of Genghis Khan. But by and large, the Mongols, their empire, and their later destiny remain terra incognita. Nor did the empire built up by the Mongols leave, as far as we can judge, any very remark- able traces in their own historical consciousness. Accepting that the confused centuries following the collapse of empire led to considerable destruction of written records, the almost com- plete lack of native historical writing from imperial times is still surprising, and suggests that there may not have been much there to start with. What we have today is the so-called Secret History of the Mongols, preserved fortunately in an uncorrupted state and almost entirely intelligible. The book known as Cayan teuke, the 'White History' (edited and trans- lated with a commentary by Klaus Sagaster, Die weisse Geschichte, Wiesbaden, 1976, reviewed in BSOAS, XLI, 1, 1978, 400-401) provides an insight into a theory of Mongolian statecraft, but otherwise there is not much historical writing till we reach the chronicles of the seventeenth century and later. A glance at the most easily accessible of these, the Erdeni- yin tobci (1662, German translation by I. J. Schmidt, 1829, reprinted Manesse, 1985) proves how little use they are for the historical, as distinct from the folkloric, study of the early Mongols. A magic aura surrounds the imperial period. Genghis Khan has already become a figure of anecdote and legend rather than of history, and if the Mongol conquest of China is touched upon, the campaigns westward hardly rate a mention. To understand the Mongol empire one must turn to what others wrote about it at the time, Persians, Chinese and a few European travellers and chroniclers, and to the reflection of these primary, or semi-primary, sources in the secondary works of European historians from Petis de la Croix (1710) onwards. Morgan gives a critical description of the source material available, and then, rather than go once again into the tangled tale of empire and succession states, he proposes a number of themes, both narrative and topical, and presents his opinions, taking judicious account of those of his prede- cessors. He deals in turn with the state of nomad society before the Mongols, the founding of the empire, its nature and institutions, the Mongols in China, the expansion to the West, and the Mongols and Europe. Finally, he gives a brief sketch of the later history of the Mongols, bringing it up to 1961 and their entry into the United Nations, but this is a mere epilogue, not on the scale of detail of the preceding chapters. Not that the main chapters of the book go into much detail in any case, apart from the odd aside. Morgan has had to paint on a broad canvas, and wisely has restricted himself to his special interest, and one where he is an established expert-the history of the imperial period. The history of the Mongols after 1400 is quite another matter, both thematically and in terms of the type of source material to be investigated and the linguistic expertise required. Even so, within the modest scope of 206 pages he has given a surprisingly compre- hensive picture of the mediaeval Mongols, their types of administration, military affairs, reli- gion, economic matters and so on. The facts are not new-how could they be?-but the judi- cious weighing up of them and the critical evaluation of the hypotheses of other historians is what gives this book its solid value, and allows one to recommend it honestly as a first- rate introduction to the study of a little known passage of history. There are of course topics one would like to have seen developed. The 163</page></plain_text>
