Marty, A Nation of Behaviors, (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1976, $8.95). An impressive command of various disciplines has always distinguished Daniel Bell's publications. In The Cul tural Contradictions of Capitalism he weaves together his knowledge of sociology, economics, philosophy, and several art forms to identify the basic flaws in American society. Bell finds that the three realms of American society—Economic, Political, and Cultural—are based on differing axial principles, have diverse social struc tures, and respond to disparate tem poral rhythms. The present situation, he claims, testifies to the superiority of Max Weber's analysis of Western soci ety over Karl Marx's.

BOOKS 121</page><page sequence="8">Marty's study of the constellation of religious behavior is an informative contribution to the sociology of reli gion, but leaves this reviewer with an uncomfortable after-effect. Marty the religious person is nowhere in evidence in this book; he writes as a social behav iorist who has screened out his own religious views. Or can we take this study as a subtle form of indirect com munication? Is Marty telling us that this is where religion is at, so get with it? Or is he ironically telling us that where religion is at is no place for a religious believer who treasures his belief? Mar ty's religion belongs somewhere on his map but he leaves the reader to guess at its location. George Pepper</page></plain_text>
