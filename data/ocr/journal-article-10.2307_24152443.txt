<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hostile Environment. This film is part of NBC-TV's "Animal Secrets" series and was not designed specifically for classroom in struction. It contains a diffuse collection of related ideas rather than a sequential treat ment of the stated theme: the continual struggle of man's "internal environment" to survive in his external environment. Human beings are frail, but our defense mecha nisms and our intellectual foresight are so highly developed that we can react to protect ourselves from the hostile outside world. When we want to explore new environments, we develop a new technology to make this exploration possibleâ€”an example is the use of lower forms of life in bio-space experi ments to help us better predict the effects of the hostile space environment on man. In addition to exploring the physical environ ment, we also explore new ways of predict ing the effects of the emotional environment on the human brain. The film can be used at any level from sixth grade to early college as an idea generating device, but it is not strongly in structive. Some teachers will object to the anthropomorphism contained in the narra tive, and in some instances the sound track is not well integrated with the visual presen tation. 24 min. $300. 1968.
