<plain_text><page sequence="1">Petroglyphs of the Three Rivers Area Jack Ross Roswell, New Mexico As a means to supply the demand for fuller information on the subject of petro- glyphs, members of the Chavez County Archaeological Society have elected to devote considerable time to this subject, in photographing, sketching and documenting the many fine specimens in and around the Chavez County area. As a result, this paper is offered as a preliminary report on what should be considered a most im- portant site in the area - not only for the aesthetic quality, but also for the clarity and abundance of the unique symbols. The location of the site is in Otero Coun- ty, midway between Tularosa and Carri- zozza, approximately 4l/2 miles northwest of the settlement of Three Rivers, in south- central New Mexico, and is readily ac- cessible by a good dirt road where one can drive directly to the site. The ridge or hogback, upon which are located hundreds of petroglyphs, is ap- parently the result of a volcanic upheaval as is indicated by the burned basaltic boulders forming the ridge and in some instances rising to a height of 142 feet. The ridge winds in a serpentine manner for a distance of one and one-eighth miles. The general area surrounding the ridge appears to be ideal as a more or less per- manent location for establishing an aborig- inal camp site for a number of reasons. Five streams, for a period of time, pro- vided the area to some degree with per- haps a variety of fish as well as drinking water. Due east of the ridge are the Sac- ramento Mountains, along with a lesser range of mountains known as the Godfrey Hills, where elk, deer and bear could be The author is president of the Chavez County (New Mexico) Archaeological So- ciety, a well known amateur, and a member of a number of archaeological societies.

Directly to the west are the White Mountains and the valley between them, where the site lies, afforded some protec- tion during the winter as well as protection from the winds. It must be presumed that writing de- veloped from the technique of drawing pictures. Petroglyphs and pictographs, in- cidentally, are very old techniques. As early as the middle paleolithic period man has made crude drawings. Petroglyphs themselves are not a form of writing, how- ever they may serve as reminders or memoranda of past events. In some so- cieties petroglyphs were thought to be used not only as a memorandum, but also as a news of communication between one group and another. And so for centuries, primitive man has attempted to leave a history of his accomplishments in the form of graphic illustrations pecked into or painted upon rocks and boulders. The subject matter of these engravings ranges through a wide representation in- dicating hundreds of details from the daily life of these aboriginal communities, their habits and economy. Symbolically, they might well express an ethnological record of prehistory in the southwest. We can assume the artists represented what went on around them. We see individuals in their daily surroundings, their weapons, hunting scenes and animals. Other sym- bols reflect ceremonial or religious repre- sentations. Curiously enough, scenes de- picting hostility and violence are non- existent. Quite frequently, petroglyphs depict com- binations of human and animal ' character- istics. These are termed anthropomorphic and zoomorphic. The true meaning of these styles remains as much a mystery as do the majority of the engravings. So for the purpose of this paper, petroglyphs will be divided into four distinct groups- ani- mal, human, religious and abstract. No interpretations of petroglyphs will be attempted in this paper other than to 33</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 19 Petroglyphs in the Three Rivers Area.

It is interesting to note, however, in the study of petro- glyphs, that one cannot help but form some literal opinion as to their meaning. The general development of this art is from symbolism to narrative. Many of the engravings are a continuous repetition of signs, which probably had religious sig- nificance. The subjects most frequently used in this style include the sunburst, human figures often appearing with tree- like head-dresses and, quite often, gro- tesquely engraved masks. In other in- stances, human figures carry an up-right staff, often quite long with either a banner or tree-like mass at the top, (quite sug- gestive of a primitive unbrella,) in all probability a ceremonial banner, with minor variations. Several styles, which depict human figures, differ dightly with respect to head-dress and staff. The major- ity of the human figures are shown either in profile or in full face. In the latter instance they usually have both arms raised at the sides with the elbow flexed. The staff is held in one hand, while the other hand is usually empty. The figure, itself, is depicted in some instances quite naturalistically, although crudely, with rounded head and body, while other fig- ures are represented by box-like and stick bodies. The use of straight lines, repre- senting arms and legs, was noted in some instances. A few figures were pecked in full embodiment. A striking comparison of these con- ventionalized depictions bears elaboration at this point. Upon examination of several panels, it was noticed that in no single instance did more than two human figures appear in any one group. Further study revealed the entire lack of weapons associated with these figures. Brief mention is made of an associated form relating to the human figure which depicts types of gargoyle-like masks, pre- sumably ceremonial. Predominant and throughout the general area, the animal emerges as the center of attention. The majority of the animals de- picted are quite recognizable, such as the jack-rabbit, mountain goat, bob-cat, toad, lizard, coyote, birds, fish and snakes. There are figures that are not equally pro- portioned because of added embellishments and are lacking in essential details which precludes definite assignment with any certitude. A style appearing quite frequent- ly and in association with the animal representations, is the bear paw, differing moderately in styles and sizes, and ranging from three to 12 inches in size. They are found singularly or in groups generally following a specific pattern, as in the actual walking habit of the animal. Of equal importance are the frequent styles of doubtful and abstract representa- tions. Many of these geometries are beau- tifully executed. An excellent example most frequently observed is the recogniz- able sunburst. While many of these sym- bols appear attractive and well balanced, there are others which appear to be utterly fantastic and absolutely meaningless. After a visit to this area several years ago, with periodic visits in the interim, and in view of the obvious vandalism oc- curring, the society felt impelled to docu- ment the many fine specimens as a sig- nificant part in the re-construction of the pre-history of this region. Evidence of considerable human as well as natural destruction was reflected by the large number of specimens found at the base of the ridge and scattered throughout the general area. Large numbers of carv- ings were and still are continually being destroyed and carried away by vandals. This situation was encountered even dur- ing our survey. Since relatively little systematic work has been attempted in the field of petro- glyphs in this area, we decided upon a systematic documentation and count of the engravings. The following is a break- down as to types: HUMAN There are 81 human representations. Of this number, 42 were solidly pecked (con- ventionalized body form and added em- bellishments); 39 were represented as stick figures; and 8 represent genital or- gans. Figures range in height from four inches to a little over two feet. ANIMAL There are 369 animal representations. Of this number, 143 are lizards; 39 snakes; 35</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 20 PetroglvDhs in the Three Rivera Area. Chavez and Otero Counties in south central New Mexico.

ABSTRACT AND QUESTIONABLE Three hundred and seventeen fall into this category. 187 are complete in them- selves. Of this number, 33 are recognizable sun symbols; the remaining 97 are ques- tionable. Considerable attention was given in our field notes to geographic features of the site, geological information, location, height" and directions. Additional informa- tion concerning the petroglyphs themselves included weathering, style of pecking, pecking measurements, and any unusual features about the panel or symbol. After this the symbols were carefully chalked in and photographed. A general surface survey of the entire area was made in an attempt to establish a relative chronology of the area. In doing so the following factors were taken into consideration - superimpositions, weather- ing, and certain definite changes in style sequences. Only three superimpositions were noted and, after discussions and care- ful analysis, some question arises as to whether they are actually superimposi- tions or merely the artist's attempt to overlap his work. Several instances of extreme weathering were noted. There was no change in style, however. The area, being well known to surface collectors, had little to offer in the way of artifacts and pot-sherds. The few items that were collected by the group have been sent to Santa Fe for study and possible dating in helping to establish a chronology or perhaps effect a correlation of this material with the petroglyphs. Nothing concrete in this connection can be offered at this time. Unfortunately, no thorough analysis of the cultural significance and nature of the petroglyphs has been made thus far, but it is the opinion of the author that, in all probability, rock carvings in this general area express pictorially the evidence of the existence of a well organized ceremonial hunting cult.</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 22 Left - Spearhead fashioned from pink mottled chert. 7x/% inches in length.
