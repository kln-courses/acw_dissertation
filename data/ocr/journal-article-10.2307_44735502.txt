Leslie Williams Abstract Socially conditioned cognition regarding supernatural entities is still very much alive in Japan. The results of this pilot study are based on the free-listing and sorting activities performed by twenty-three Japanese nationals with regard to three categories of supernatural beings: ancestor spirits (senzo), Shinto spirits {kami), and "changeling goblins" ( obake ). Hierarchical clustering of respondents' responses regarding 1) locations at which each class of being is most likely encountered and 2) what persons or items become each type of supernatural being provides clearly defined sets of data that reveal much about the shared cognitive domains for modern Japanese with re- gard to these supernatural entities. In particular, this study will show that the 1) degree of human identity, 2) the level of cognitive familiarity, and 3) the either positive or negative value judgment of respondents all serve to distinguish these three sets of phenomena as discrete socially defined categories. The degree to which super- natural entities are perceived to claim positively- valued, familiar, and human characteristics appears to be di- rectly correlated to the level of ritual attention they receive from the living. Notions regarding supernatural beings are prevalent in every society. Traditional Japan was certainly no exception to this pattern. Given the incredible social and technolog- ical that have taken place since the conclusion of World War II, are citizens of this island nation still in touch with such ideas about the supernatural world? Or have they become more unfamiliar with such ideas with the passage of time? Interestingly enough, notions regarding the traditional supernatural world have not completely faded; rather, such ideas are frequently portrayed in the related realms of Japanese comics (manga) and animated films (anime). Not only are traditional views of spiritual beings and the larger supernatural realm fertile ground for such creative enter- prises - both comics and animation appear to effectively propagate these notions among younger generations. The results of this pilot study are based on the free- listing and sorting activities performed by twenty-three Japanese nationals with regard to three categories of su- pernatural beings: ancestor spirits ( senzo ), spirits vener- ated within the Shinto tradition (kami), and "changeling goblins" (obake). Beings in this last group can be further subdivided into either mischievous monsters (yõkai) or unhappy ghosts (yürei). Hierarchical clustering of these responses regarding 1) what locations at which each class of being is most likely encountered and 2) what persons or items become each type of supernatural being provides clearly defined sets of data that reveal much about the shared cognitive domains for modern Japanese with re- gard to these supernatural entities. These data will be compared to previous scholarship. This study aims to be a means of both defining each type of entity and also a means of comparing the three. In particular, this study will show that the 1) the degree of human identity, 2) the level of cognitive familiarity, and 3) the positive or neg- ative value judgment of respondents all serve to distin- guish these three sets of phenomena as discrete socially defined categories. Background The realm of traditional Japanese supernatural enti- ties includes three important features: ancestor spirits, kami beings, and changeling goblins. Modern study of Japanese supernatural beings has one hundred twenty- four years of history, and yet, even at the present there is a great deal within this field of inquiry that eludes re- searchers both inside and outside of Japan. The early pioneer and father of Japanese ethnography Yanagita Kunio (1875-1962) and those who followed after him adopted a very holistic treatment of the subject. Yanagita worked to thoroughly understand the social back- ground of the phenomena. He investigated various as- pects of religious practice, he considered the social func- tion that concepts about supernatural entities play, and he set about collecting legends and beliefs about these be-</page><page sequence="2">58 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 ings in order to define types of beings and to apprehend the change of such beliefs over time. For example, fol- lowing the serious earthquake in the Ansei era (1855), the production of catfish print ( namazu-e ) amulets exploded. Popular belief linked with the Kashima Shrine identified the origin of earthquakes as a catfish under the earth that wiggled from time to time. Although serious belief in this folktale had lapsed by the Edo period (1615-1867), the production and consumption of these amulets still served several social purposes, one being a bid by townsfolk of the time to feel they were in control of their lives by re- sorting to this symbolic control and parody of their ap- prehensions (Komatsu 1994:13-14). Yanagita was very interested in analyzing such beliefs in a more practitioner- sensitive fashion; he was interested in understanding the social role and ramifications of folk belief. Yanagita signaled the beginning of the modern ethno- graphic study of Japanese supernatural beings. Four ob- jectives guided his inquiry into the subject. First, with a sense of urgency akin to performing salvage ethnography, Yanagita set out to gather information regarding super- natural beings from regions all over Japan in order to plot and analyze their distribution. Second, he worked to iden- tify characteristics by which he could distinguish monsters ( yõkai ) from unhappy ghosts ( yürei ). Third, he labored to better understand the relationship between kami beings and changeling goblins. This latter relationship he defined, concluding that kami beings who lose veneration from the community become goblins (Komatsu 1994:15). Fourth, he sought to establish a clear relationship between ances- tors and kami beings (Yanagita 1946; Yanagita 1970). Not all of the distractions that Yanagita made as a result of his fieldwork have stood the test of later scholarly inquiry, but the field of inquiry dedicated to the ethnological explica- tion of supernatural entities in Japan is even now indebted to his efforts. His accurate findings continue to guide schol- ars in the field even at the present (Komatsu 1994:19-20). Why Bother with Spiritual Beings? Some scholars, such as Harumi Befu, feel that exam- ining different classes of spiritual beings is unimportant. In the analysis of Japanese folk beliefs, the theolog- ical distinctions often made among gods, deities, souls, and spirits is irrelevant: we are referring to an entity which resides in either natural or man- made phenomena, and has supernatural power of a benevolent or malevolent nature depending on the situation, much as the mana of Oceanic soci- eties (1971:104). I argue, however, that such distinctions are relevant; they are critical to our understanding of the phenomena them- selves and are vital when we consider their social ramifi- cations. For example, the ability to define what sort of situation makes a spirit good or bad represents a small victory in terms of our familiarity with very particular details of socially-constructed Japanese cognition. This type of analysis can lead to further sociological insights and culturally-shared cognitive structures of meaning. Further clarification of the cognitive structures of the Japanese supernatural world will greatly benefit all fields of Japanology. With regard to Japanese history, the pro- lific folklorist - and intellectual descendant of Yanagita - Tanikawa Kennichi (1921-) asserts: On the backside of the routine treatment of Japan- ese history, there exists another extremely unusual current [of history]. That is none other than the history that is presided over by the evil spirits (ma) of deceased human beings . . . and the history of the legends of these spirits, if it is neglected, I think [this omission] hampers the ability of Japanese his- tory to make sense (Komatsu 1994:21). Tanikawa makes the cogent point that socially- shared no- tions regarding spirits of the angry dead ( onryõ ), includ- ing Taira no Masakado for example, have exerted great influences over generations of Japanese in terms of their social organization and the shared collective rituals in which they have participated. Clifford Geertz asserts that in order to understand the role religion plays in social and psychological terms: first, the "system of symbols" that serves to comprise a religion, instead of being "taken for granted," must be "elucidated" in order to apprehend the "ethos . . . and worldview" that such an aggregate of symbols is utilized to create (1973:89, 125). The scholarly tendency to avoid the realm of su- pernatural beings in Japan by explaining that the "natives" themselves make no distinction, and thereby excusing ourselves from further familiarity with this conglomer- ate of understandings, only hinders our ability to more effectively explicate folk beliefs regarding the supernatu- ral world in Japan. The present study will generally follow the fundamental assertion of Yanagita that ideas concerning supernatural beings are a valid topic of inquiry because they signifi- cantly influence the social and psychological lives of human beings. There are three classes of supernatural be- ings in Japan: ancestor spirits, kami beings, and changeling goblins. What characteristics distinguish each of these categories one from another? The most complex of the three is the category of changeling goblins. We will examine them first.</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 59 Goblins The name applied to this first category, changeling gob- lins ( bakemono ; obake ), indicates that these spirits change or transform from their original appearance. During the Heian period, these same beings were called simply "demons" (mono) or "demonic forces" ( mono-no-ke ) (Ko- matsu 1994:159). Yanagita Kunio argued that human be- ings had a role in the transformation of these spirits; he specifically defined goblins as kami beings who have lost ritual attention from the living and that resultantly have ill will toward the human community (Komatsu 1994:16). Per- forming arts historian and folklorist Suwa Haruo (1934-) has further clarified that "goblins are [the spirits of] things other than humans, or are human [spirits] that appear in a shape other than their human form" (Komatsu 1994:16). Historian of Japanese manners and customs Ema Tsutomu (1884-1979) identifies six sources as the origin of goblins, including the spirits of: human beings, animals, plants, tools, objects in nature, and a heterogeneous group of other miscellaneous items (Komatsu 1994:175). The Muromachi era collection of various changeling goblins entitled "Divine Record of Changeling Beings" (Tsukumo jingi) indicates that things did not indiscriminately transform; rather, "accord- ing to manuals of Taoist magic ( Onmyõdõ ) after reaching the age of at least one-hundred years, things obtain a spirit and become capable of transforming their shape," thus be- coming shape-shifting goblins (Komatsu 1994:176). Research by cultural anthropologist and folklore spe- cialist Komatsu Kazuhiko (1947-) makes a finer distinc- tion of goblins between mischievous monsters ( yõkai ) and unhappy ghosts ( yürei ). Goblins, he says, do not appear as they did in life. If originally human, they might ap- pear as a one eyed, one-legged umbrella or a mountain goblin - but always in a changed shape. Ghosts, on the other hand, always appear as they did in life, or as they did at death (Komatsu 1994:190-191). Komatsu indicates that a long history of vindictive ghost belief ( onryõ shinkõ) in Japan, in addition to the special rituals held for these ireful ghosts (goryõ-e ), clearly identify the prevalent idea that if these unhappy spirits failed to receive ritual attention, it was popularly feared that they would become goblins and plague the living (Komatsu 1994:183). He explains: "The weak and vanquished in history, by dying be- come ireful ghosts that in legends come back to attack the strong victors who bested them in life," or in other words, goblins [the structurally weak parties] return to rule over living human beings [the structurally advantaged parties]. The role of ireful ghosts is great in Japanese history . . . the history of specters and humans are so intertwined as to be unable to be separated" (1994:186). A prevalent example is the Heian period nobleman Sug- awara no Michizane (845-903), who after suffering slander, exile, and death was thought to have returned and wreaked havoc on his enemies before being en- shrined with the grand title "Heavenly Spirit Filling Heaven" ( Tenman-gü tenjin). By enshrining and vener- ating this vindictive spirit, the human community thought themselves capable of rendering the unruly being harmless, and in fact, transform his surging en- ergy into a source of power that could be harnessed for the common good. Yanagita conducted ethnography to gather folk beliefs concerning the supernatural from the various regions of Japan and plot their distribution. Even as he did so, con- cern with supernatural beings plummeted as the nation struggled to make ends meet, rebuild its economy, and pattern itself more closely along Western lines in the post- war years. Yet, in the 1980s, a resurgence of popular in- terest in goblins flourished at precisely a time when such concerns about supernatural beings should have been dealt a coup de grâce by Japan's urban explosion. Folk- lorist Miyata Noburu (1936-2000) documented (1985) a goblin renaissance among young women in urban areas, while the writings of author Matsutani Miyoko (1926-) [Book series: Gakkõ , 1987] and author and folklorist Tsunemitsu Tóru (1948-) [Book series: Gakkõ no kaidan, 1995] detailed the production and consumption of nou- veau goblin folklore in urban school settings (Komatsu 1994:22-25). These authors' book series are tales that in- volve supernatural beings in nocturnal school settings and these books enjoyed an enthusiastic reception by the Japanese public, particularly among young people, who were spellbound by these presentations of encounters with ghosts and goblins at school. Komatsu argues that the demise of goblin folklore was largely due to the disappearance of traditional dwellings and living arrangements together with the explosion of electric lighting, both in the home and on roadways (Ko- matsu 1994:114-115). These modern developments served to lessen the centuries-old attitudes regarding par- ticular areas of the traditional home, and they also exor- cised the dark and ambiguous areas that had once been fertile ground for the encounter of spooky feelings and / or these beings. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, Kamatsu maintains that certain "removed" and "dark" places in Japanese urban settings continue to be fertile areas around which appre- hensions regarding goblins are still found (1994:1 16 - 122). These include places connected with death, such as graveyards, hospitals, and the sites of serious traffic ac- cidents (Komatsu 1994:138), as well as places that are re- moved, such as abandoned buildings and toilets (Komatsu</page><page sequence="4">60 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 1994:138-143). Finally, he identifies dwellings that are haunted by goblins, including the spirits of the previous owners, as another cognitive feature that persists. Most modern goblins are ghosts, Komatsu elucidates (1994:145-147). He explains that Japanese now no longer believe in animal goblins; contact with nature for most urban Japanese has become severely curtailed and, as a result, apprehensions regarding nature are minimal. He asserts, however, that individuals still either believe, or seem to believe in the spirits of dead humans, and that perhaps at least on this level apprehensions regarding ghosts still exist (Komatsu 1994:148). Nevertheless, the routine person on the street does not do ethnographic research nor plot distributions like the scholars who have given us the preceding conclusions. For ordinary Japanese, "Mischievous monsters ( yõkai ) are . . . [anything] that is hard to understand, or hard to order, [and] is given the name [of monster] for the pres- ent." (Komatsu 1994:159) For many Japanese, goblins are cognitively linked with a feeling of wonder, but ultimately are unexplainable phenomena, that Komatsu points out must remain unknown for them to continue to be iden- tified as such (1994:38-39). Kami Beings Fundamentally, kami beings belong to two broad classes: 1 ) anthropomorphic beings that are enshrined, that include the spirits of deceased humans that receive regular ritual attention, including the beneficent Collec- tive Ancestor ( sorei ), and 2) non-anthropomorphic enti- ties that are not enshrined, including the spirits of de- ceased humans of a menacing nature, who receive much more infrequent ritual attention. Kami are considered to be spirit beings. The scholar of Shintõ and specialist on the psychology of religion Ueda Kenji (1927-2003) make the broad distinction between kami beings that are anthropomorphic and enshrined, and ones that are not humanized and not enshrined, the latter being identified by names such as "spirits" (mi) and "demons" (mono). The category of enshrined, anthropo- morphic kami include "... the ancestors of emperors and famous clans; the kami of food and productivity, of land and profession; and finally, historical figures who have made an outstanding contribution to society" (Ueda 1996:35). The second class "rank below the anthropomor- phic kami" and are considered to inhabit various features of the land. While not housed in a shrine, they are offered ritual on occasions such as the "land pacification rite" ( jichinsai ), in a bid for them not to harm humans that will thereafter occupy the immediate locality (Ueda 1996:35). Based on examination of ritual form and terminology in several regions of Japan, Yanagita Kunio makes the as- sertion that anthropomorphic kami and ancestral spir- its are directly related phenomena. First, he outlines the ritual process by which household ancestral spirits grad- ually merge to become a Collective Ancestor entity (sorei) ģ He asserts that the Collective Ancestor, often identified with the aged Okina and Ona couple (1970:59), is closely related to belief in various kami beings based on the am- biguity surrounding their rituals. The ritual performed for the Collective Ancestor, he found, often resembles ritual focused on kami entities such as the New Year kami ( toshigami ), the kami of fields ( tanokami ), and the clan kami (ujigami) (1970:59, 64, 79, 131). The Collective Ancestor identified by Yanagita and its identification with kami is substantiated by Cornell cultural anthropologist Robert Smith, who says that the Collective Ancestor, with both ritual propriety and time, become the household kami that protect and prosper their descendants (1974:56). The Okina role in Noh, portrayed by an actor wear- ing the mask of a smiling old man, has been identified as a symbolic representation of the Collective Ancestor by Yanagita (1970:59). He explains, "The soul [of an in- dividual ancestor] could detach itself from the sense of self and blend into the powerful spiritual image of the ancestor to become freely active on behalf of the family and work officially for the land" (1970:130). The Okina mask used in Noh theatre is surrounded by various rit- uals and taboos; the Okina role is preeminent among the class of plays known as "kami plays" (kami-nõ). Some scholars have interpreted the Okina role as being the per- sonification of the field kami (ta-aruji; tanokami) that Yanagita has equated with the Collective Ancestor, and in the popular tradition, the Okina role is said to portray the kami that presides over the fertility of the fields (Or- tolani 1990:67). While no conclusive research has yet pinned down the origins of the Okina role, the notions of Okina presiding over the blessings of "long life, fertil- ity .. . and peace and prosperity" (Ortolani 1990:67) make its link to the Collective Ancestor all the more plausible. This particular group of blessings is the same category over which anthropomorphic kami are considered to pre- side as well. British cultural anthropologist Carmen Blacker makes a further distinction that anthropomorphic kami are ca- pable of entering the dimension of the living on their own power from the "other world" that they inhabit (1975:35). Based on his ethnographic fieldwork experi- ences, Yanagita asserts that this "other world" is none other than a different dimension within the natural land- scape, and that these anthropomorphic kami beings visit</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 61 humanity at fixed times in the ritual calendar when they are invited (1970:146). Unlike the God of Catholic or Protestant doctrine, kami do not live in a dimension that is cut off from sinful humanity; rather, kami live in the realm of nature (mountains, rivers, the sky, and so forth) and come into closer contact with the living at specific junctures in the seasons and in the agricultural calendar (Williams 2000:36). Senge Yoshihiko, priest at Izumo Taisha, explains: Kami exist in a floating, unstable, changeable, in- visible state; they are spirit. They take up residence on various objects, and "stabilizing mediums" ( hi - morogi) are used to stabilize the kamisama. They alight on the [evergreen] sakaki branches and then they are received here [at the shrine] where they are escorted to the two long [shrine] buildings. These buildings are like a hotel for the kami, so to speak (Williams 1997:174). This practitioner's explanation makes several important points corroborated by Blackers work (1975:38-40). First, kami are unstable spiritual entities that require "stabiliz- ing mediums" (for example, yorishiro or himorogi) on or in which kami may lodge and thus be able to abide at a ritual site for a period of time. The very earliest kami rit- ual necessitated these "stabilizing mediums" since the spir- its were thought to visit a ritual for only a brief period of time. Second, with time and the construction of shrine buildings, kami beings were lodged for longer periods of time in a "kami body" ( goshintai ) such as a mirror or sword that was placed inside the shrine building (Blacker 1975:40). The rites that are regularly offered to these en- shrined spirits are an important social means of defining and redefining these entities as beneficent, anthropo- morphic kami. A second class of kami, a group on non- anthropomorphic entities that are not enshrined, are also recognized in the Shinto tradition. Japanese respondents readily admit that there are both "good" (anthropomorphic) and "bad" (non-anthropomorphic) kami. Tamura Toyohiko, priest at the Hakozaki Hachiman Shrine elaborates: In times past, crossroads were important places since the idea existed that things would emerge there. In Japan there are both good kami and bad kami; the bad ones are given to mischief ( itazura ). There is the expression, "to be pos- sessed by an evil spirit, to come under an evil in- fluence, to be unlucky" {ma ga sasu). The word ma means "a space in between {ma or aida Peļ);" you know, like the space between two times. There are kami called Magatsukami; they are bad kami. The [the name Magatsukami] is the origin of this expression {ma ga sasu). That kind of kamisama would be at the crossroads, and if you don't do things [perform ritual exorcism] right there, things might happen" (Williams 1997:151-152). What type of spirit becomes a bad kami? Menacing kami seem to be the same as "relationless spirits of the dead" {muen-botoke). Smith identifies two sets of the deceased that are candidates for this distinction: first, those who had a "violent . . . unfulfilled death and therefore exist in a state of spiritual limbo in world of living; and second, "those who are not venerated by descendants" for what- ever reason (1974:41, 44). These spirits he identifies as "being on the fringes of veneration," (1974:50) meaning that they are either neglected in terms of ritual attention or only occasionally receive such attention. Practitioners of the Shinto tradition regularly identify the haunt of these disquieting and occasionally dangerous spirits as being at crossroads, corners, shorelines, entrances, and other spa- tial boundary areas (Williams 1997:17). The negative per- ception of these kami in Japanese society is due to their embodiment of "liminality" (Turner 1969:95-96). Lim- inality represents a mode of being outside of social struc- ture that is "disordered," "unlimited," and "indefinable" and as such challenges and threatens the ordinary "pat- tern" and "order" that is defined and maintained by soci- ety (Douglas 1966:94-95). But most importantly, these particular deceased spirits are not enshrined, are nega- tively perceived, receive little or no veneration, and are potentially harmful to the human community. Ancestors Ancestral spirits are identified by Japanese informants as deceased family members. These spirits are most typ- ically enshrined in the household Buddhist altar {butsu- dan ); the symbol for their presence in the altar is the mor- tuary tablet {thai) on which the spirit's posthumous Buddhist name {kaimyõ) is inscribed. These ancestral spir- its receive daily ritual attention by descendants of the household, usually the wife of the household head. Given the possibility that deceased humans can potentially be- come "relationless" wandering spirits, the incentive for descendants to regularly venerate their predecessors is great. But with proper ritual attention, ancestors are thought by the Japanese to be capable of progressing in terms of ritual purity and of granting blessings to their living descendants. Smith outlines a process of progres- sion affected by ritual performed by the living for the spirit</page><page sequence="6">62 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 Table 1: Summary of Data for Ancestors, Good Kami, Bad Kami, and Goblins ANCESTORS GOOD KAMI I BAD KAMI GOBLINS Location: Enshrined at home ( butsudan ) Enshrined in shrine Not enshrined; in land- Not enshrined; abandoned, scape at spatial boundaries removed, dark areas Character: Beneficent Beneficent Menacing, harmful Menacing, frightening Ritual Attention: Regular Regular Infrequent None Familiarity: Well-known, becoming less so Less known Unknown Unknown with time of the family member; this, he argues, is the goal of an- cestor veneration. A "spirit of the newly dead" ( shirei ) progresses with time and the performance of ritual to be called a "new buddha" ( nii-botoke ), then "buddha" ( ho - toke ), "ancestor" ( senzo ), and finally is considered to be- come kami (Smith 1974:56). Categorical Integrity and Transition Supernatural beings in Japan fall into three categories; their distinguishing features are summarized in Table 1. Two sets of facts are clarified by considering this table. First, differing levels of contact and familiarity with the human community serve to create a continuum among the four types of beings. Ancestors are the most well- known. Second, common features exist between ances- tors and good kami on the one hand, and bad kami and goblins on the other. Ancestors are the most familiar cat- egory since their shrine is in the home; the family's reg- ular veneration makes them beneficent and they are the most well-known of all the spirits. Their immediate fa- miliarity fades with time and the passing of elder family members, but even so, this host of household spirits, when merged together as the Collective Ancestor, is al- ways viewed in a positive light. Good kami share many of these qualities of regular contact and familiarity. Bad kami and goblins also exhibit many similarities. Neither class of spirit is formally enshrined. Bad kami are thought to lurk in features of the natural landscape or to lurk in spatial boundaries; goblins are equated with aban- doned, removed, and dark locations. Neither class of being is composed of known entities; both represent a hetero- geneous mix of wandering spirits traditionally thought to be potentially threatening or harmful. The locations with which they are identified and their pattern of receiving ir- regular or no ritual attention are important criteria that distinguish them. Bad kami occasionally receive Shinto (and also Buddhist - see Smith 1974:42-43) ritual atten- tion, while goblins routinely receive none. A further clue that bad kami and goblins are related sociological phe- nomena is that, as noted earlier, both of these sets of be- ings have been called "demons" (mono). Obviously, an- cestors and good kami occupy central and prominent positions in the human community, while bad kami and goblins wander on the periphery, vaguely acknowledged and effectively marginalized in terms of veneration. Although a great deal of time has been devoted to ex- amining the defining characteristics of spiritual beings in Japan, ancestors, kami, and goblins are not three mutu- ally exclusive categories. Smith and Yanagita both indicate that ancestors can and do become good kami. But, can an- cestors become goblins, or can goblins become good kami? Simply put, the possibility that ancestors can become goblins, or more precisely "relationless spirits" (muen- botoke) or "hungry ghosts" ( gaki ), exists if ritual venera- tion of the spirit is neglected, or if the individual dies in a fit of "bitterness" or "ill will" ( urami ) without proper veneration from the living (Smith 1974:41, 44). With re- gard to the proposition of goblins becoming good kami, or good kami becoming goblins, Komatsu Kazuhiko pro- vides some interesting examples. Goblins basically receive little or no ritual attention and are generally considered to bring misfortune to the human community. Good kami, on the other hand, are enshrined, do receive regular attention, and are consid- ered to bring life, happiness, and wealth to the living. But rather than being static categories, the relationships be- tween good kami and goblins are both fluid and relative (Komatsu 1994:36-37). Refining the work of scholar of Buddhism and folklorist Nakamura Teiri (1932-), Ko- matsu argues that the human reaction to the actions of a spiritual entity serve to define its status. When a strange figure is identified, and if that being commits threaten- ing, harmful, or spiteful actions, then it is a goblin. If its actions are serious enough to necessitate being subdued or eliminated by the human community, the being is defi- nitely then a goblin; such behavior warrants the name (Komatsu 1994:38-40). On the other hand, good kami</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 63 are spiritual beings that, from the onset, benefit the human community. As a result, this characteristic con- vinces the community to enshrine and venerate the being. This veneration further defines the entity as a good kami (Komatsu 1994:38). Hypothetically, veneration of a good kami could lapse, its shrine crumble, its actions threaten the community, and the being could request through a medium to receive ritual attention once again. This would be a kami who has, at least temporarily, become a goblin (Komatsu 1994:34, 39). Conversely, in the account of Yamata no Orochi recorded in the origin myths of the Kojiki , this terrible eight-headed serpent call Orochi was venerated by the local people and offered a maiden every year as a living sacrifice. But an outsider, Susanoo, came, slew the serpent, and married the princess that was about to be offered. In this instance, Susanoo's eradication of the local "good kami" labeled its actions as being those of a gob- lin that he subdued (Komatsu 1994:37-38). Obviously, the terms kami and goblin are relative depending on one's point of reference. For the locals before Susanoo came, Orochi was a good kami; but for Susanoo, the serpent was a goblin that devoured young women (Komatsu 1994:41-42). The social group to which one belongs is also a factor in determining whether a being is identified as a kami or goblin. Moving on to the fieldwork portion of this pilot study, for the Japanese participants in this study, free-listing and sorting activities were used to ascertain where these three types of supernatural beings are thought to be found and what sorts of things become each type of entity. Although scholars have clearly demonstrated that transition can and does occur between the three categories, this study's goal was to define the constituent elements of each group and the locations at which members of each group can be en- countered. Defining each category of spiritual being will allow us to better understand how these three sets are cog- nitively defined in Japan. The Research The instrument used to compare the cognitive struc- tures in Japan for three groups of Japanese supernatural entities: ancestors, kami, and goblins, provided interest- ing insights. While no one member of Japanese society knows everything concerning these three classes of super- natural beings, each individual does possess varying lev- els of familiarity and knowledge. Knowledge concerning these types of supernatural beings is distributed through- out Japanese society among individuals who are reposito- ries of this information in greater or lesser degrees. For this study, two groups of individuals participated in a free-listing activity. During the summer of 2000, nine Japanese engineers at Clemson University con- tributed data to this pilot study. Two of the engineers were female and seven were male; their ages ranged from twenty-two to twenty-five. Each respondent, using Japan- ese language, completed four free-listing activities. First, each individual names places at which kami could be en- countered; when totaled, there were twenty- five cumu- lative locations so named. Each person then identified places at which obake could be encountered; these ac- tivities resulted in thirty-six locations pinpointed. Next, each person free-listed items that could become kami; the result was a total of thirty items so named. Each in- dividual then identified items that could become obake; the product of this exercise was a total of twenty-three cumulative items. Following the free-listing exercises, the researcher printed the four sets of data, one item each on a single index card. Then each participant was invited to sort each group of data into meaningful cat- egories. The questions used to initially elicit the four groups of data are shown in Table 2: Table 2: Questions about Kami and Goblins 1. Where can kami be encountered? 2. What sorts of things become kami? 3. Where can goblins be encountered? 4. What sorts of things become goblins? Then, during the summer of 2001, a group of fourteen individuals living in Kyoto completely two free-listing ac- tivities in their native Japanese. Twelve respondents were female and two were male, their ages ranging from thirty- seven to seventy-five. Each person free-listed places at which ancestors could be encountered; when these re- sponses were put together, they had collectively identi- fied thirteen locations. Again, each individual free-listed things that become ancestors; when taken together they named eight items in this category. Once again, the re- searcher printed the two sets of data, one item per card, on index cards. Then, each participant sorted each of these two data groups separately, placing items within a data set into meaningful categories. The questions used to elicit the two groups of data are shown in Table 3: Table 3: Questions about Ancestors 1. Where can ancestors be encountered? 2. What sorts of things become ancestors? While it would have been desirable to have all twenty- three respondents free-list and sort items for ancestors, kami, and obake, given the time constraints involved, this was not possible. Nevertheless, the validity of the find- ings is still intact in that members of Japanese society gen-</page><page sequence="8">64 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 erated and sorted these lists of information, thereby of- fering us valuable cognitive insights regarding these par- ticular sets of information. Information regarding what items become a certain type of supernatural being was first elicited from each in- dividual respondent during a free-listing exercise. After- wards, all of these Japanese language responses were listed and put on index cards with an identifying number on the back of each. Each individual was then given a well- shuffled stack of index cards and asked to sort them into groups of similar items. After completing this exercise, each respondent was questioned about what each cate- gory of items represented for them. Afterwards, this same process took place regarding places at which a particular type of supernatural entity was likely to be encountered. For each item in the broad category of things that be- come kami, for example, all of the responses were first recorded, tabulated, and then used to create a matrix of each item identified in the free-listing activities. Each ma- trix, summarizing all respondents' categorization of the phenomenon for each item, was then taken and manu- ally sorted hierarchically with all other matrices in a given category, such as places where goblins might be encoun- tered. Items were sorted with regard to degree of relat- edness among items. The result for each category of re- sponses was a set of nested responses which, in turn, revealed the major subsets for each category as identified by respondents' collective perceptions. The Results: Where are they Encountered? The first set of data provides us with a collective pic- ture of where ancestors, kami, and goblins are perceived to be encountered. As summarized in Figure 1, for an- cestors, 62% of the responses from the free-listing activ- ity were sorted into the category of Memory Locations which included: places with memories, family gatherings, photographs, in my mind, in my own existence, a hos- pital, anyplace [where I remember], and mementos. The remaining 35% of responses for places at which ancestors can be encountered were Sanctuary Locations that in- cluded: Buddhist altar in the home ( butsudan ), graves, Buddhist temples, at home at Obon, and together with a necromantic shamaness ( itako ). Interestingly enough, 43% of respondents when asked about places where an- cestors could be encountered spontaneously mentioned, or even made detailed lists of times at which ancestors can be encountered. These times included: Obon, the spring and autumn equinoxes, "memorial death date obser- vances" ( meinichi ), New Year's, when one is in danger, when one's hands are pressed together in prayer, and on quiet nights. Obviously, not only is place a significant fac- tor in the encounter of ancestors, but time also figures largely in the cognitive processes regarding contact with ancestor spirits. As shown in Figure 2, the three most popularly rec- ognized places to encounter ancestors in terms of fre- quency of response in the free-listing activity were 1) graves (listed by 79% of respondents), 2) Buddhist altar in the home (71%), and tied for third place, 3) Buddhist temples and photographs (both 29%). The data regarding places at which kami are encoun- tered are slightly more heterogeneous than those for an- cestors. As seen in Figure 3, five subsets were identified by respondents within the larger set of places at which kami are likely to be encountered: Sanctuary Locations Figure 1: Where Are Ancestors Encountered?

Sanctuary Loca- tions included items such as shrines, temples, and divine trees ( shinboku ). Remote Natural Environment Locations were comprised of items including mountains, forests, and sea coasts. Remote Locations included: rural areas, dreams, heaven, and reflections on the surface of water (. suikyõ ). Human Dwellings included the home and cars. And finally, Sickness/Death Sites comprised hospitals and accident scenes. As shown in Figure 4, the three most often mentioned places to encounter kami in the free-listing activity were Shinto shrines (listed by 89% of respondents), mountains (56%), and Buddhist temples (44%). Places at which goblins are likely to be encountered comprised the most diverse set of information and, as seen in Figure 5, included: Deserted Human Dwellings (28%), Remote Natural Environment Locations (25%), Sanctuary Locations (17% of responses), Death Sites (14%), Dark Places (8%), and Random Sites (8%). The category of Deserted Human Dwellings was comprised of responses such as toilets and closed hospitals and ho- tels. Remote Natural Environment Locations included Figure 4: Where Are Kami Encountered? Figure 5: Where Are Goblins Encountered? such items as rivers, beaches, and tunnels. Sanctuary Lo- cations included shrines, temples, graveyards, and places near statues of the bodhisattva Jizõ. Death Sites were in- tersections where there was an accident, old battlefields, and Aokigahara at Mt. Fuji. Some of the Dark Places in- cluded closets and dark places. Random Sites were forests, cars, and old wells. As listed in Figure 6, the most commonly free-listed locations for goblins were, in first place, 1 ) graveyards (listed by 89% of respondents), tied for second place were 2) Shintõ shrines and forests (each 56%), and in third place were 3) Buddhist temples, beaches, closed hospi- tals, and old schools (each mentioned by 44% of re- spondents). The Results: What is their Origin? The second set of data originates from respondents' perceptions of what items become ancestors, kami, and goblins. By far, items that were reported to become an- cestors were the most homogenous set of the three. Two subsets accounted for all items that were free-listed. As seen in Figure 7, the vast majority of responses were De- ceased Humans which accounted for 90% of all answers during the free-listing activity. The other set of answers was Animals which consisted of 10% of all responses. When asked about these animals, respondents talked about "animal ancestors" ( doubutsu no senzo) that they Figure 6: Where Are Goblins Encountered? Figure 7: What Sorts of Things Become Ancestors?</page><page sequence="10">66 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 equated with evolutionary theory and the origin of the human species. As shown in Figure 8, Deceased Humans was the most frequently offered response (listed by 100% of respon- dents), followed by Animals (14% of respondents). Again, categories of items that become kami were more diverse in character. Listed in Figure 9, four subsets of informa- tion comprised this set of data: Deceased Humans (44% of responses), Animals (23%), Natural Environment Fea- tures (23%), and Human-Shaped Objects (10%). De- ceased Humans was a diverse set including ancestors, an- cient emperors and nobles, and Sugawara no Michizane. Animals included: wolves, dogs, foxes, and very old an- imals. Natural Environment Features consisted of items including old trees, water, and earth. And finally, Human- Shaped Objects were: rocks or mountains shaped like peo- ple, and Buddha images. As seen in Figure 10, the most frequently listed items in descending order were: big, old trees (listed by 56% of respondents), ancient people (33%), and foxes, dogs, self- disciplined people, ancestors, water, and sky (each men- tioned by 22% of informants). Items identified as becoming goblins were the most di- verse in terms of the number of categories. Listed in Fig- ure 1 1, the five subsets of this category included: Deceased Humans (35% of responses), Animals (26%), Natural Environment Features (9%), Personal Effects (17%), and Architectural Features (13%). Deceased Humans included such candidates as young women, suicides, and acciden- Figure 8: What Sorts of Things Become Ancestors? Figure 9: What Sorts of Things Become Kami? tal deaths. Animals included cats, monkeys, and dogs. Natural Environment Features were big, old trees and wil- low trees. Personal Effects included umbrellas, paper lanterns ( chõchin ), and dolls. And finally, Architectural Features were walls, houses, and hospitals. As shown in Figure 12, the most frequently listed items were: cats (listed by 67% of respondents), foxes and dolls (each mentioned by 44% of respondents), and badger- dogs ( tanuki ) and big, old trees (each 33%). Discussion Three factors are borne out by this ethnographic study: social categories of ancestors, kami, and goblins are cog- Figure 10: What Sorts of Things Become Kami?

Figure 12: What Sorts of Things Become Goblins?</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 67 nitively constructed in terms of 1) the differing level of human identity, 2) the degree of familiarity for each type of spirit, and 3) the positive or negative social value as- sociated with each. First, we will consider the degree of human identity that each category of being is perceived to exhibit by respondents. Table 4 outlines the salient data that we will examine. Based on respondents' sorting activities, ancestors are identified as having the highest level of human identity. Respondents identified 90% of items that become ances- tors to be human beings. Kami had the next highest level of human identity, with 43% of items becoming kami identified to be deceased humans. Goblins were collec- tively identified as possessing 35% human identity. Clearly, ancestors are perceived to have the greatest identifiable human origin, kami less so, and goblins are identified as having the least. One hundred percent of respondents in the free-listing activity agreed that human beings become ancestors. The second most frequent, free-listed item among the top three responses identified to become kami was Ancient People, listed by 33% of respondents. Finally, among the three most frequently free-listed items said to become goblins, no human category was identified. Based on this criteria, for the category of goblins, human identity was nonexistent. Furthermore, in what way does the level of familiar- ity with each group serve to cognitively shape the cate- gories? Table 5 outlines the important data in this regard. For ancestors, nearly two-thirds (62%) of identified locations are associated with memories. This fact alone indicates that the level of familiarity with ancestor spir- its is both high and emotionally intimate. Ancestors are also thought to be at Sanctuary Locations, a central fea- ture in many Japanese communities. While kami are iden- tified with Sanctuary Locations and Human Dwellings, both being relatively central locations for human com- munities, three features, Remote Natural Environment Locations, Remote Locations, and Sickness/Death Sites comprise nearly one-half (48%) of places with which kami were identified by respondents. This remote, more pe- ripheral nature of kami locations indicates a greater de- gree of cognitive distance for them when compared with the places identified with ancestors. Goblins appear to be the most distant cognitively. Re- mote and peripheral places including Remote Natural En- vironment Locations, Deserted Human Dwellings, Death Sites, and Dark Places accounted for nearly three-fourths (72%) of areas at which goblins can be encountered. Not only is the human element very weak for the goblin cat- egory, this group is also the most peripheral and cogni- tively distant set in terms of location. Kami are decidedly less distant from the human community; ancestors are certainly the most familiar and cognitively close. Informants' remarks with regard to ancestors included the following.

(forty-five-year- old female) "Any time, day or night, anytime I think of them in my heart, or put my hands together in prayer [I can en- counter my ancestors]. Ancestors are the source of my being and can be thought of as the people who protect me." (forty-six-year-old female) "Ancestors and kami are similar in that they both are existences that protect us." (forty-two-year-old female) Kami, particularly good kami, also have a very posi- tive value for respondents. Respondents equated kami with: "religious places," (a twenty-three-year-old male and a twenty-two-year-old female), "holy places," because "good spirits protect and help everyone" (another twenty- two-year-old female), and one even added the insight that "emperors all are kami" (twenty- four-year-old male). Goblins appear to be the most sinister of beings. In particular, three types of goblins were said to be threat- ening entities: "over the shoulder spirits" ( haigorei ), "lo- cality confined spirits" (jibakurei ), and "aborted fetus spir- its" ( mizukorei ). These three types of spirits were identified as being "real ghosts ( yürei )" and "not just superstition." "These are spirits with ill will and grudges," explained a twenty-two-year-old female. One twenty-five-year-old male claimed that "many people believe that they exist." On a whole, respondents were most serious when it came to discussing this variety of entity, insisting that these were the most troublesome, and one twenty-four-year- old male asserted that "these are serious ghosts, the most scary, and very real to me." Of all three categories of su- pernatural beings, the reaction to goblins was the most negative and worrisome to the respondents. Cultural anthropologist Kawano Satsuki reports that her informants tend to have "warm, close emotional feelings toward ancestors ( hotoke), while toward kami they report more distant, respectful feelings (Kawano 2002; Kawano 2003, 126-127). Kawano concludes that in the cognitive universe of her informants, ancestors are identified as "in- siders" {uchi) y while kami are considered "outsiders" {soto) (Kawano 2002, Kawano 2003, 126-127). Kawano's work closely corroborates this study's findings; goblins simply fell beyond the focus of her study, but as we have seen, gob- lins are even more "outside" than are kami. In summary, the data from this ethnographic pilot study indicate that human identity, familiarity, and value judg- ment on the part of respondents serve to distinguish and define the three groups of beings that we have been exam- ining. Ancestors appear to have the most clearly identified perception of being human, seem to be held emotionally close by respondents, and appear to be positively valued as well. Good kami appear to have somewhat less human iden- tity, are perceived by respondents to be equated with more cognitively peripheral environments, and yet, overall ap- pear not to be negatively valued. Goblins, however, are con- sidered to have the fewest human attributes, are identified with the most remote and peripheral locations, and are the category which seems to elicit the most apprehension. Conclusion This study substantiates some of the early conclusions of ethnographer Yanagita Kunio (see Table 1). First, both ancestors and good kami are related phenomena in that they both are cognitively classified inside the perimeters of human society and both receive ritual attention from the human community. Cultural anthropologist Robert Smith (1974) has shown beyond this that ancestors over time and with the performance of ritual can and do progress to become kami beings. Yanagita also appears to have been accurate in his observation that goblins do not receive veneration. However, Yanagita's theory that all goblins are kami that have lost ritual attention is not cat- egorically accurate. Komatsu's (1994) work shows that while some goblins may indeed originate as "fallen" kami, not all goblins can be said to start out as kami beings. One example being items that are over a century old spon- taneously can shapeshift and become goblins. As substantiated in previous scholarship examined in the course of this study and further clarified by the pres- ent ethnographic research, the categories of ancestor, kami, and goblin appear to be meaningful cognitive cat- egories in Japanese society, even at the present. Particu- lar cognitive similarities are shared between the categories of ancestor and good kami (see Table 1 ), namely the char- acteristics of being enshrined, beneficent, regularly ven- erated, and familiar presences to the human community. Cognitive parallels have also been observed between the distinctions of bad kami and goblin: neither class is en- shrined, both are menacing entities, they either receive infrequent or no ritual attention, and they are generally nameless, unknown beings. The findings of the present ethnographic study seem to have been both substantiated by and to have validated the earlier work of Ema (1976), especially his six categories of goblin origins, and Ko- matsu (1994), more particularly his cogent observations regarding cognitive identification of goblins with "re- moteness," "darkness," and locations related to death. This pilot study also has been further validated by Kawano's (2002; 2003) observations regarding ancestors and kami. Furthermore, this pilot study has provided three addi- tional parameters that appear to meaningfully define the three categories of spiritual beings that we have been con-</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 29 (2) 201 5 69 sidering: 1) degree of human identity, 2) the level of cog- nitive familiarity, and 3) the positive or negative value judg- ment. Ancestors, it has been suggested, were identified by respondents as human, emotionally and cognitively cen- tral, and of the three, the most positively valued. Kami, likewise, were next in order with attributed human origins, were more cognitively peripheral in terms of location, and yet, overall, were positively valued. Goblins had the least human identity attributed to them, were equated with the most remote and peripheral locations away from the human community, and were the focus of the greatest amount of apprehension expressed by respondents. The huge popularity of the comic books and animated films seem to be a very important means by which younger Japanese are exposed to traditional notions about the supernatural world. The younger respondents, while pile-sorted types of goblins in this study, made particu- lar and frequent mention of Mizuki's animated television series "Kitarõ the Goblin". Obviously, this series has sup- plied respondents in this study, at least, with concepts about the world of goblins. Respondents also mentioned stories told to them when children by their grandparents as another source of their knowledge about supernatural beings. In Japan, comics and animated films serve as one channel of exposure to the supernatural, but a secret to the vast popularity of this aspect of popular culture may lie in the resonant chord they strike within younger Japan- ese, harking back to childhood memories and stories they were told by grandparents and others. It is also possible that some younger Japanese discover the traditional su- pernatural world for the first time in these genres of pop- ular culture, not immediately realizing that they have stumbled upon the socially-defined, cognitive structures of premodern Japan. Younger generations of urban- dwelling Japanese certainly have more frequent access to and contact with comics and animated films than they do to their grandparents and persons of that generation. All of the issues raised here would make fruitful avenues of scholarly inquiry in the future. References Befu, Harumi 1971. Japan: An Anthropological Intro- duction.
