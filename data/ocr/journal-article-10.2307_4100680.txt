This paper surveys and evaluates the archaeological research relevant to these communities and issues carried out in the region since the early 1990s. Among other themes discussed are the processes responsible for the emergence and transformation of pastoralist societies (princi- pally in the Cape), the ways in which rock art is increasingly being incorporated with other forms of archaeological data to build a more socially informed view of the past, the analytical strength and potential of ethnographically informed un- derstandings of past farming societies and the important contribution that recent research on the development of complex societies in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin can make to comparative studies of state formation. K EY WORD S: South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, archaeology. IT is fourteen years since a paper surveying the recent archaeology of southernmost Africa appeared in this Journal.1 During this time not only has archaeological research continued to thrive, expanding into new themes and new geographical areas, but the social and political context in which it is conducted has also been radically transformed. More even than when this article's predecessor appeared, archaeological attention now focuses on the full range of human life, not simply the establishment of chronological se- quences.2 This is therefore an appropriate moment to continue the tradition of presenting a summary and review of relevant research in the hope that it 1 T.

For reasons of space we confine ourselves almost entirely to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. For similar reasons, our primary emphasis remains indigenous food- producing societies, pastoralist and farmer alike, but if the changes of the past decade and more in southern Africa's politics and archaeology teach one thing, it is that compartmentalized understandings of the region's past are deeply flawed, embedding and perpetuating rigid distinctions that did not, in fact, exist. While much of what we say pertains to the pasts of Khoe-speaking herders and Bantu-speaking farmers, we review recent work on the archae- ology of hunter-gatherer communities over the past 2,000 years. Limitations of space alone restrain us from considering the increasing contribution that archaeology makes to understanding European colonial societies in the re- gion, for which several recent reviews and collected essays exist.3 All the sites referred to in the text are shown in Figure I. One further preliminary comment is required. Radiocarbon dating con- tinues to form the foundation of archaeological chronologies and southern African researchers benefit enormously from Pretoria's internationally re- puted Quaternary Dating Research Unit. It is not yet universal practice in southern Africa for such radiocarbon dates to be either calibrated or con- sidered as critically as is now the case in other parts of the world. Radiocarbon dates (more correctly 'determinations') cannot be directly equated with calendar years because of past (and still continuing) fluctua- tions in the production of radiocarbon isotope. A process of calibration, normally undertaken by reference to tree-ring (dendrochronological) sequences, is required where such equations are desired. It is becoming increasingly standard practice for archaeologists working with past farming societies to report calibrated dates alongside the initial radiocarbon determinations, but this is not yet the case for all those working with hunter- gatherer or pastoralist sites, nor for those undertaking reviews that draw on material from a range of sites or regions. Exceptions, such as the assessment of determinations from indigenous farming contexts undertaken recently by John Vogel and Annemarie Fuls,4 point the way forward in this respect by making more consistent use of calibrated dates. We feel strongly that this procedure is essential if archaeologists wish to relate one site or assemblage to another properly, or to assess the durations of archaeological entities, rates of change and relationships between archaeological evidence and that obtained from other - often historical - sources. All dates given here are thus ex- pressed according to a calibrated chronology, using the Pretoria calibration 3 See, for example, M.

The problem of an expanded date range is further exacerbated during the last 350 years because of fluctuations in the global radiocarbon inventory. Most determinations also continue to be run using conventional radiocarbon techniques and thus depend upon the accu- racy of presumed stratigraphic associations between the dated material and the event that archaeologists actually wish to date. The few projects that have explicitly set out to use the more expensive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) technique, which can measure the radioactivity in much smaller samples than conventional radiocarbon dating methods, emphasize how readily small items may be displaced within archaeological stratigraphies.8 Archaeologists need to bear this in mind when selecting specimens for dating and should also make increased use of short-lived samples, such as cereal grains or animal bones, rather than wood charcoal that may have come from longer-lived plants.' At the same time, there is scope for developing complementary dating methods, such as thermoluminescence or optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), which can measure the ages of individual clay furnaces or potsherds directly."1 HERDERS AND HUNTER-GATHERERS To organize our discussion we opt in the first instance for a geographical division between the drier western third of southernmost Africa and the more humid, entirely summer rainfall region to its east. In the very broadest terms, the former displays an archaeological unity in that it was here that sheep-, goat- and cattle-herding pastoralist communities speaking Khoe languages were encountered by the first European observers. As was the case more than a decade ago, an enduring theme of archaeological research in this region has been to understand the relationships that developed between people without livestock and those with them, and how those relationships altered over time. Back in 1991, the debate in part turned on how far the 6 T. N. Huffman, A Handbook to the Iron Age: The Archaeology of Precolonial Farmer Societies in Southern Africa (forthcoming).

Andrew Smith, in particu- lar, employed a range of criteria to recognize and distinguish two archae- ological signatures on sites in the Vredenburg Peninsula area of the Western Cape Province.n Herder sites had few formally retouched stone tools, many potsherds, larger ostrich eggshell beads and faunas in which seals and sheep were common. Hunter-gatherer sites, on the other hand, had relatively many formal stone tools, few potsherds, smaller beads and faunas rich in wild game such as steenbok. Subsequent analysis of sites in the Northern Cape led to a similar distinction there between those attributed to a herder-associated 'Doornfontein Industry' and those assigned to a hunter-gatherer associated 'Swartkops Industry'.l2 Other workers were less certain, reading the eth- nohistoric record in different ways and arguing that this dichotomy reified differences that reflected not ethnicity, but rather different positions on an economic continuum within a single society.13 The apparently rigid spatial segregation in site use that Smith's model implied, and the inapplicability of all his discriminating criteria to other sites where herding activity could be presumed, have also been critiqued.14 Boomplaas, with its multiple, stratigraphically distinct occupations documenting the keeping of sheep inside the cave in the mid-first millennium, has yet to be brought into this debate.15 To cast new light on these issues further excavations have been undertaken at the Kasteelberg site complex. Not yet fully reported, this fieldwork supports earlier survey work on the Vredenburg Peninsula directed by Karim Sadr that suggested that significant temporal differences occurred there in ceramic style, stone tool use and subsistence behaviour over the past 11 A.

In the early first millennium, for example, sites at Kasteelberg seem to have been briefly occupied by groups concentrating on inland, rather than coastal, resources: groups, moreover, who had some access to domestic sheep. In the later first millennium, more sedentary communities concentrated on shoreline resources and sheep. In the early second millennium seals, in particular, were an important resource (for fat as well as for meat), ceramics came equipped with lugs and stone tool assem- blages were informal and macrolithic. Finally, in the centuries immediately preceding Dutch settlement sites show lugged pottery that was now deco- rated and a switch back to microlithic stone tools. Whether this sequence is to be read in unilinear evolutionary terms is unclear, but it underlines the complexity of the historical processes that must have been taking place. Both Chris Henshilwood, who has worked in the southeastern part of the Western Cape Province, and Sadr have emphasized this in other ways."7 Cattle, for example, seem to have been a much later introduction than sheep - their earliest documented presence in the region is from Kasteelberg around 9oo - and much of the historically attested competition between hier- archically organized tribal entities may have flowed from this, or even from attempts to benefit from the trade in livestock initiated by European visitors to the Cape after 1488. Modelling the rates at which documented herd sizes could have been built up and how such numbers might have been maintained would be of interest. Of concern here too is the suggestion that we need to decouple the settle- ment in South Africa of Khoe-speaking herders from the initial introduction of sheep. This introduction is now reasonably well dated, albeit from still too few sites, to the very end of the first millennium BC. The application of AMS dating has been instrumental here. Results have shown that sheep specimens are often many centuries younger than the layers in which they have been found, emphasizing the importance of developing more sophisticated un- derstandings of how local rock-shelter deposits were built up.'s At Blombos Cave in the southeastern Western Cape Province, however, two sheep bones are directly dated to the first century AD and at Spoegrivier in Namaqualand a third is dated to the first century BC, with other dates implying a presence some centuries before this.9" These are the earliest, well-contextualized dates 16 K.

Their provenance may ten- tatively support an introduction south via Namibia, rather than along the river systems of the South African interior, as recently suggested by Ben Smith and Sven Ouzman from the distribution of geometric rock art that, they argue, should be associated with the historical Khoekhoen.20 The chronology of this art remains only poorly constrained, while the fact that it occurs in areas such as Mpumalanga and along the upper Vaal and middle Gariep Rivers from which no archaeological or historical evidence of early herder presence has yet been recovered casts doubt on the exclusiveness of its Khoe associations. The one exception may lie in the Limpopo Valley where sheep are well represented in hunter-gatherer rock paintings and two kinds of pottery have possible herder associations.21 One, which falls outside the confines of any known farmer-associated wares, has been paralleled with thin-walled, herder-linked pottery from Geduld, Namibia. The other, now known not just from Botswana and Zimbabwe but also from the Magaliesberg and Waterberg Plateau, is Bambata ware.22 Stylistically linked to Kalundu Tradition farmer pottery, its recurrent associations with stone tools and an economy emphasizing hunting and gathering suggest that it was made, or at least used, by foragers who had access to sheep, if not by herders themselves.23 The AMS dates to which we have referred raise the issue of the source from which sheep might have been derived. Even allowing for an extremely rapid spread south from the Zambezi Valley, the most likely entry point into southern Africa, one would have to predict a date for them there of perhaps 200-400 BC. The difficulty here, which is not resolved by a still centuries AD. That from Spoegrivier, reported in Sealy and Yates, 'Chronology', is 2105 ?65 BP (OxA-3862), which has a calibrated range at one standard deviation of 165 CAL BC - CAL AD 13. More recent work at Spoegrivier has confirmed a slightly younger AMS-dated presence for sheep in the second/third centuries AD, for which see L. Webley, 'The re-excavation of Spoegrivier Cave on the west coast of South Africa', Annals of the Eastern Cape Museums, 2 (2001), 19-49. These new dates refute an earlier suggestion that sheep preceded pottery by several hundred years in the Spoegrivier sequence based on initial conventional radiocarbon dates reported by J. C. Vogel, I. Plug and L. Webley, 'New dates for the introduction of sheep into South Africa: the evidence from Spoegrivier Cave in Namaqualand', South African Journal of Science, 93 (1997), 246-8. 20 B.

So too are Diane Gifford-Gonzalez's recent arguments for the importance of wild game-hosted diseases as brakes on the spread of domestic livestock south of the Equator.28 One reason why archaeologists have turned to the central Zambezi as a potential 'homeland' for the introduction of domestic sheep into southern Africa is that they have frequently assumed that this introduction was brought about by immigration and because they have followed historical linguists who place the origin of the Tshu-Khwe languages, to which Khoe belongs, in northern Botswana/southern Zambia.29 This correlation is attractive, and one should certainly not underplay the level of knowledge required to raise and care for sheep in sustainable numbers. However, there are other possible interpretations. One, developed by Sadr, notes the apparent absence of any clearly identifiable material culture markers attributable to a Khoekhoe population during the first millennium AD. He further argues that the di- versity of ceramic decoration evident at the three sites of Geduld, Kasteelberg and Toteng is incompatible with any straightforward north-to- south movement of migrating herders."3 Instead, he points to the ethnohis- torically documented association of Khoe herders with pottery bearing lugs, 24 A date of 2260o 60 BP (N-2314) from Situmpa is reported by N. Katanekwa, 'Some Early Iron Age sites from the Machili Valley of South Western Zambia', Azania, 13 (1978), 1 35-66.

Two sites at Toteng have been attributed by Huffman to early farming communities, consistent with his placement of Bambata ware within the Kalundu Tradition (see below). The lack of structures and evidence for metalworking, the plentiful stone tools and the obvious stratigraphic disturbance at these sites makes this claim uncertain; see Reid, Sadr and Hanson-James, 'Herding traditions'.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY OF SOUTHERNMOST AFRICA 217 identifies the dates at which such ceramics first occur and relates this to a series of changes in the Kasteelberg sequence around 900. Here, and in the appearance of lugged pottery elsewhere in South Africa, may lie the archae- ological signature of an incoming Khoe population ancestral to those groups encountered at the Cape by Europeans after 1488. If Sadr is right - and both the Kasteelberg sequence and the dates of lugged pottery elsewhere would benefit from tighter chronological controls - then those Western Cape com- munities who possessed sheep before about 9oo were not Khoekhoen. Rather, they may have been indigenous hunter-gatherer communities who, perhaps seeking prestige or enhanced economic security, acquired sheep and ceramic technology (not necessarily simultaneously) through the exchange of animals and ideas.31 Recent work by Antonieta Jerardino on the late Holocene hunter-gatherer archaeology of the Western Cape's Atlantic coast supports this notion by documenting a previously unsuspected degree of sedentism and resource specialization (most obviously by exploiting shellfish and other littoral resources).32 Stable isotope analyses of human remains from the same area confirm this,33 while comparable studies much further east around Plettenberg Bay imply that radically different subsistence econ- omies were followed in close proximity to each other, again implying very limited movement away from the coast.34 As Simon Hall, John Parkington and others have previously argued, the consequence for archaeologists is that we need to liberate our minds from a few Kalahari-based ethnographic models and think more widely and creatively about past hunter-gatherer behaviour.35 31 The role of climatic change in this adoption, and in the initial spread of sheep from the northernmost Kalahari, needs further investigation. Cooler, wetter conditions along the Namaqualand coast and Namibia may have facilitated the dispersal of sheep down the western flanks of southern Africa at the end of the first millennium BC; see D.

Scott, 'Palynology of hyrax middens: 2000 years of palaeoenvironmental history in Namibia', Quaternary International, 33 (1996), 73-9. The impact of colder conditions, in particular, on the plant foods, small game (and, on the coast, shellfish) on which foragers depended for many of their subsistence needs also warrants further enquiry. 32 A.

There we may be able to develop more readily the degree of temporal control needed to resolve time, space and the actions of individuals and thus investigate those questions about the struc- tured use of space, gender and other aspects of social relations that have increasingly become attractive over the past two decades. Dunefield Midden campsite near Elands Bay remains the prime example of such a site, and has, over the past fourteen years, produced numerous dissertations, including a superb analysis by Tobias Tonner and an ongoing doctoral study.36 Together, they elucidate the activities undertaken by the occupants of this massive site - over 700 m2 have been excavated - activities that included eland hunting, whale meat processing and shellfish gathering. The vast ma- jority of the Dunefield site was never overprinted by subsequent occupation and undoubtedly reflects no more than the presence of people for a few months at most. Comparable 'moments in time' are evident from sites in the Geelbek Dunes near Langebaan,37 from a springbok killsite near the Namaqualand coast38 and from repeated, largely fishing-focused occupations at Likoaeng in Lesotho's highlands.39 Pastoralist sites with similar potential have been investigated at Jakkalsberg A and B and Bloeddrift 23 near the Namibian border.40 Thus far we may have given the impression that recent archaeological research on hunter-gatherers and herders has been an exercise very much conducted close to Cape Town. While there is some truth in this, reflecting the location there of thriving university and museum departments, it is far from the whole story. The past fourteen years have also seen a swathe of 36 T. W. W.

Here, near the eastern edge of the Karoo, the ceramic sequence broadly parallels that from the Western Cape and pottery was probably introduced to local hunter-gatherers as herder communities entered the area around 500. Subsequently, a distinctive set of grass-tempered wares was developed by local foragers, differing in temper, clay, size, shape and decoration from contemporaneous Khoekhoe ceramics." Throughout the sequence revealed by Sampson's fieldwork, herder settlement in the Seacow Valley remained restricted to its upper reaches and was organized around contiguous waterholes in areas roughly the same size as modern sheep farms.42 Rock-shelter sequences and written sources indicate that herders disappeared from the area before European settlement began in 1770, per- haps because of drought during the Little Ice Age. Declining game numbers at the same time may have prompted hunter-gatherers to intensify ostrich egg collection as an alternative source of protein, producing 'pavements' of the broken shells inside many shelters.43 The subsequent Dutch intrusion into the area, which precipitated a generation-long conflict before hunter- gatherer resistance was suppressed, has also been a subject of keen research by Sampson and his colleagues. Collectively they have traced the gradual appearance in rock-shelter sequences of European artefacts and the dis- appearance of traditonal stone, bone and ceramic technologies, initially as a consequence of gift, trade and plunder, later as part payment for work as surviving Bushmen were forced to settle on European-owned farms, dis- possessed of their land and turned into a proletarian rural labour force. Acquiring guns from farmers, Bushmen also actively participated in the destruction of game herds, further undercutting their own independence. One short-term consequence, however, may have been that some sites, such as Driekoppen, were occupied for longer and developed into centres for ritual activity.44 41 The key papers are: K.

Fourteen years on, fieldwork has expanded into new areas, cultural sequences have been re-evaluated and a better understanding of the nature of first millennium farming communi- ties is in place. Significant new work has also taken place on the symbolic dimensions of farmer material culture and the relations between farmers and hunter-gatherers. We touch on all of these issues, proceeding along broadly chronological lines, but for heuristic reasons leave the origins and develop- ment of southern Africa's first state-level societies in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin to a later section. In framing this part of the paper, we employ a series of specifically ar- chaeological identities derived from studies of material culture, mostly cer- amics and settlement layout. There is good evidence in southern Africa that such entities can be linked, at varying scales of analysis, to known political or linguistic identities. In some cases, for example, ceramic data clearly mirror the origin and history of particular linguistic groups as reconstructed from independent sources; Venda origins in the interaction of Sotho- and Shona- speakers are a good example.45 There has been resistance from some scholars to making such equations, but the relationship is based on the widely accepted principle that material culture can express group identity. In applying this principle to the southern African ceramic sequence, we must be reasonably certain that the makers and users of pots were the same and that the stylistic entities (or facies) are determined using appropriate classificatory variables, such as decoration and vessel shape. We need also to consider the historical circumstances that gave rise to each facies. For the purposes of this paper, we stress that facies reflect large-scale identities that did not corre- spond to political units, except possibly in the case of the Mapungubwe state between 1250 and 1300, and the Great Zimbabwe state around 1350.46 Facies have temporal as well as spatial boundaries, and stylistic sequences are divided into phases according to changes in decorative style through time. As the Venda example shows, in most cases such change is likely related to linguistic change. Facies with a common ancestry tend to change in similar though gradually diverging ways, a pattern that is presumably related, in a complex way, to the hardening of distinctions between dialects. 45 T.

We have greater clarity on another kind of stylistic change, and one that is easier to understand. This is when ceramic changes at the level of style structure, not motif, occur over a large area, implying large-scale movements of new people into an area. Identification of an earlier source area for the new style provides further support for the migration. The tendency in much of the literature to equate particular ceramic styles with linguistic groups is not, however, without its problems. As a practical matter, it is clear that many sites were occupied for many generations, while others were occupied on more than one occasion.47 Without carefully ex- cavated, large ceramic assemblages from across an entire site, and many such excavations within a particular area, there is a danger that chronological and typological inferences may be drawn from mixed samples. The emphasis in ceramic classification on decoration layout and motif also demands that the archaeologist avoid using small samples to generate typological conclusions. Finally, invoking population movements at local, regional or supra-regional scales - for which there is, of course, ample historical evidence in recent centuries - should not lead us to ignore alternative possibilities when explaining change and variation in material culture, nor the potential relationships between earlier and later settlers. The replacement of the Kalundu Tradition by Blackburn and Moloko in the early second millen- nium is a classic example of where this last issue is relevant. Continuing field research, in particular in KwaZulu-Natal, and re- evaluations of earlier excavations at Broederstroom (North-West) and the Lydenburg Heads Site (Mpumalanga), have further refined archaeological understanding of the ceramics made by first millennium AD farming com- munities.48 All belong to what is termed the Chifumbaze Complex, within which two major groupings or traditions are discernible: Urewe and Kalundu.49 The Urewe Tradition is further divided into at least two branches, Nkope and Kwale. South of the Limpopo Urewe is represented early on by 47 Ndondonwane, name site of the Ndondonwane phase, is an exception here in having occupation material just of that period; see T.

Sites are found there, and in Swaziland, southern Mozambique and southeast Zimbabwe, dating to around 250-430. Mzonjani, the succeeding facies, dates from 400-700 and extends into coastal KwaZulu- Natal where its sites correlate strongly with the location of iron ore outcrops and with areas receiving &gt; 8oo mm of rain per annum today. This restricted coastal distribution suggests that iron-rich areas in the KwaZulu-Natal interior were at that time too arid for successful agriculture."5 North of the Vaal River, different climatic conditions prevailed and Kwale Branch people settled from at least Broederstroom in the west to Lydenburg in the east. The reassignment of Broederstroom and a component of Lydenburg to Mzonjani has shown that Kwale Branch communities had a much greater impact on the early centuries of agriculture in southern Africa than some archaeologists had previously recognized. Still later, people making Zhizo pottery, a predominantly Nkope Branch style, settled in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin, eastern Botswana and possibly parts of Kruger Park, probably from Zimbabwe. The Zhizo facies dates from the seventh to early eleventh centuries, but occupation in the Shashe-Limpopo area only began around 900. The second main division of Chifumbaze, the Kalundu Tradition, may have origins far to the northwest in Angola, although the evidence for this is slight, reflecting in part the still limited degree of fieldwork there and in western Zambia.51 The fifth- to seventh-century sites of the Happy Rest facies make up the earliest Kalundu expression in South Africa. Happy Rest gave rise to at least four subsequent facies, all of which owe their style to varying degrees of merger between Happy Rest and Mzonjani. In the west, this predominantly Kalundu sequence lasted until the fifteenth century, with Broadhurst in Botswana.52 To the east, recent fieldwork in Swaziland by Fumiko Ohinata and earlier excavations by Andre Meyer in the Kruger National Park have produced fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Maguga ceramics that Huffman now regards as derived from the eleventh- to early fourteenth-century Kalundu facies of Klingbeil, which shares its ancestry with K2 in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin (discussed in more detail below).53 In KwaZulu-Natal, Msuluzi (in the seventh to late eighth centuries) is 50 M.

Huffman, 'Ceramics, settlements and Late Iron Age migrations', African Archaeological Review, 7 (1989), 155-82.

Denbow, 'Congo to Kalahari: data and hypotheses about the political economy of the western stream of the Early Iron Age', African Archaeological Review, 8 (1990), I39-75. As discussed above, Bambata's place within the Kalundu Tradition has also been questioned. 52 A possibly even later survival may be indicated by the Eiland-derived pottery found elsewhere in southern Botswana as late as the seventeenth century; see A. Campbell, G. Holmberg and C. van Waarden, 'A note on recent archaeological research around Gaborone', Botswana Notes and Records, 23 (1991), 288-90. 53 Ohinata, 'Archaeology'; A.

These last two also extend further south into the Eastern Cape Province, where sites like Canasta Place reflect the southernmost penetration of early farmers.54 KwaZulu-Natal has witnessed the most active fieldwork directed at understanding these communities in recent years, with excavations con- centrated in the Mngeni Valley near Durban and the middle part of the Thukela Valley. Key sites are Nanda, KwaGandaganda, Mamba, Wosi and Ndondondwane.55 Work here has confirmed a subsistence base focused on cultivating cereals, pulses and cucurbits and keeping cattle, sheep and goats. Hunting and gathering seem to have been of minimal importance, but near the coast, as at KwaGandaganda, both shellfish and fish were exploited.56 The organization of settlements was consistent with the Central Cattle Pattern (CCP) previously described by Kuper and Huffman.57 The CCP remains a powerful model in southern African archaeology, relating world- view, settlement layout and social organization through shared beliefs about patrilineality, a preference for using cattle as bridewealth, male hereditary leadership and the role of ancestors. This pattern is restricted ethno- graphically to Eastern Bantu-speakers and may be recognized archaeo- logically from centrally located cattle pens associated with high-status burials, storage pits, a men's assembly area and evidence of iron-forging. Such features occur at KwaGandaganda and Ndondondwane, and slightly earlier in the Kwale Branch sites of Broederstroom and Riverside. At the latter two sites, phytolith analysis of animal pens and dung-lined pits has helped document the presence of cattle in contexts where poor preservation, differential slaughter and ritual destruction of bones might otherwise lead to an underestimation of their presence.58 1988); T.

Such models work by subsuming variation and are not de- signed to account for all the variability evident in the archaeological record.61 Of course, that variability should not be consistently contrary to the re- lationships depicted in the CCP, and equivocal data on iron production still present a challenge to scholars of this period. Ethnographic data indicate that iron-smelting was normally conducted in seclusion because of the super- natural threats it posed to society, threats derived from its homologous association with procreation and birth. The Tswapong Hills of eastern Botswana provide a well-documented example. Forging, on the other hand, did not carry the same symbolic load and was practised inside some histori- cally known settlements. Broederstroom, Ndondondwane and the ninth- century levels at KwaGandaganda all have forging debris associated with cattle pens. However, first millennium furnace bases have been found in a central activity area at Ndondondwane (in which initiation residues also occurred), as well as at Magogo, KwaZulu-Natal, while both smelting and forging debris occurred in the seventh-century court midden at KwaGandaganda.62 Further north in Limpopo Province, Beauley in the Blouberg and the tenth-century Nkope Branch site of Schroda have appar- ently yielded smelting residues, in the latter case from close to a centrally located cattle pen.63 The difficulty in interpreting such finds lies in correctly 59 As raised, for example, by M. Hall, 'Archaeology and modes of production in pre- colonial southern Africa', Journal of Southern African Studies, 14 (1987), 1-17; and see also discussion in Maggs and Whitelaw, 'Review'. 60 Huffman, 'Central'. 61 This recognition helps refute objections raised by, for example, N. Pearson, 'Survey and excavation work at the late Iron Age site of Modipe Hill, Kgatleng District, Botswana, in Pwiti and Soper (eds.), Aspects of African Archaeology, 565-71, and, on a less site-specific level, by P.

Whatever the case, the link between smelting and procreation, and the supernatural threat they present, exist throughout the Bantu-speaking world, beyond the bounds of Eastern Bantu societies. This suggests great antiquity and it is possible that the belief structure evolved when iron-smelting technology was first acquired. Another area of life rich in symbolism that has attracted archaeological attention is that of rites of passage, to which the famous Lydenburg ceramic heads have been linked since they came to the attention of the archaeological community in the 1970s. Reassessment of the ceramics from the same site suggests that the hatched bands on the lower part of the heads indicate a ninth- or tenth-century age, younger than previously suspected, but broadly comparable to similar finds from Ndondondwane.64 Interestingly, details of the teeth on four of the Lydenburg heads probably represent dental modifi- cation, while human remains from Nanda and elsewhere document extrac- tion in adolescence of the lower four and upper two central incisors, with accompanying chipping of the canines and remaining incisors. Individuals thus operated on were indelibly marked as social adults."65 Other remains of rites of passage include ceramic female figurines, some marked with possible scarification or obvious genitalia, from centrally located court midden areas. Such figurines are commonly broken, presumably deliberately, to mark changes in the status of individuals. Ceramic vessels also had symbolic roles and many first millennium sites feature pits containing pots with deliberately broken bases. Similarly altered pots occur in the graves of children and can be interpreted through the widespread metaphorical links made between women and pots. One possibility, for example, is that the pit deposits relate to female puberty rites, with bottomless pots symbolizing the capacity of fertile women to act as channels to the ancestral world for the purpose of giving birth.66 Many of these symbolic practices seem specific to farming communities of the first millennium. The practices of burying bottomless pots, modifying one's teeth at puberty and employing sculptured ceramic heads in initiation ceremonies are not known among speakers of Sotho-Tswana and Nguni languages, who constitute the vast majority of black South Africans today. As well as the possibility that iron was smelted inside some first millennium villages, other differences have long been noted in site location strategy, grindstone shape and pit form in KwaZulu-Natal.67 These features help 64 Whitelaw, 'Lydenburg'; Loubser, 'Ndondonwane'. 65 A.

These differences are most obviously expressed by the complete disjunc- tion in the ceramic record shortly after Iooo, since the Blackburn ceramics, associated historically with Nguni-speakers and found at sites in KwaZulu- Natal and the Eastern Cape from the mid-eleventh century, cannot be derived from the Kalundu styles that immediately predate their appearance. Precisely the same is true of the Moloko styles, which first occur in the Limpopo Valley in the fourteenth century and are associated historically with Sotho-Tswana-speakers.68 The reality of this disjunction is now gen- erally accepted in archaeological circles, and receives backing from the work of Carolan Ownby, who identified loanwords of 'Sala' origin in modern Nguni, 'Sala' being a hypothesized sister language of an ancestral form of Shona.69 It is worth remembering here that the Kalundu sequence in KwaZulu-Natal shares its origin with the K2 facies, whose makers created the Zimbabwe Culture. An origin for Nguni and Sotho-Tswana somewhere in East Africa can be argued linguistically and from the evidence of kinship terminology, although only rare ceramic parallels have yet been identified."7 A possible scenario for their movement into southernmost Africa may lie in drier conditions in East Africa during the Medieval Warm Epoch, c. 900-1290, but the relations between the incoming and the (presumably more numerous) already established farming communities remain to be examined. That this is so underlines the importance of devoting research to the early second millennium, a period still very much unknown beyond the Limpopo Valley. Turning now to examine farming communities of the second millennium in greater detail, we focus first on northeastern Swaziland where Fumiko Ohinata has recognized the archaeological presence of the Tsonga of present- day southern Mozambique and northernmost KwaZulu-Natal. At Simunye, she uncovered an extraordinary cluster of pots, buried upside down and pierced through their bases, which she interprets in terms of ancestral shrines. Her work confirms the existence of a distinct Tsonga identity, beyond language and colonial construction, probably from at least the mid- eighteenth century onwards.71 Next, we draw attention to ongoing research in KwaZulu-Natal, which has focused on the second phase of the Blackburn sequence. Known as Moor Park, this began in the fourteenth century and its makers were the first farmers to colonize the higher altitude grasslands of South Africa's interior.72 In doing so they opened up possibilities for greater economic specialization 68 Huffman, 'Ceramics'. 69 C.

The same lack of timber also encouraged the adoption of stone as a building material, and in both these respects parallels can be drawn with sites excavated over thirty years ago by Tim Maggs in the Free State.73 These parallels may, indeed, reflect real historical connections between Nguni and the Free State Sotho. Tree-ring data indicate that rainfall in KwaZulu-Natal fell dramatically between 1320 and 1340 following the onset of the Little Ice Age, remaining lower for the rest of the fourteenth century than for the next 6oo years.74 This must have threatened the resource base of farming communities and the resultant stress was probably at least partly responsible for forcing Moor Park com- munities in the grasslands to construct settlements on defendable hilltops. Aridity and outbreaks of violence may also have encouraged some people to cross the Drakensberg, a possibility echoed perhaps in those oral traditions that give the Sotho-speaking Fokeng a Nguni origin and one borne out by similarities between their pottery and that of the Blackburn sequence.7" This interpretation is consistent with dates previously obtained by Maggs from Ntsuanatsatsi in the northeastern Free State, although these remain isolated and early. A comprehensive survey of relevant radiocarbon dates argues instead that the expansion of farming communities into the highveld grass- lands began as recently as I640, taking advantage of a wetter, warmer climate with more regular summer rains.76 Any interpretation must, however, accommodate the antiquity with which the Fokeng are regarded in the oral traditions of most other highveld groups and the origin of Fokeng pottery, which is different from that of pottery associated with other highveld Sotho communities. While the warmer conditions which set in on the highveld after 1420 will undoubtedly have facilitated cereal cultivation, stable isotope analysis of human remains nevertheless shows that people living in the Grassland Biome depended more heavily on animal products than their counterparts in savanna environments to the north." Further fieldwork that might investi- gate such differences, and more securely establish the antiquity of farming settlement on the highveld, is sorely needed; other than Maggs's pioneering work of a generation ago, there have been only limited excavations of sites near Winburg, in the northeastern Free State and in the former 73 T.

One dimension that could profitably be exploited in such fieldwork is the extent, organization and sociopolitical implications of the precolonial trade that moved many desirable commodities across the landscape, not least iron - whether as metal or as finished implements - grain and cattle, and thus helped underpin the settlement of metal-rich, but agriculturally deficient, areas.79 More attention has been devoted to Sotho-Tswana-associated sites further to the north and west, for which a comprehensive study of spatial and temporal ceramic variation has now been provided by Huffman. He has been able to show a strong concordance between most of the known Moloko cer- amic sequence and the history previously reconstructed from oral traditions by Martin Legassick.so Both studies concur in showing a separation of a western cluster (cf. Hurutshe, Kwena) from a southwestern one (cf. Rolong, Tlhaping) by the sixteenth century, with these more closely related to each other than to Fokeng-related groups in the Free State. Recent fieldwork has focused on North-West Province, where major projects include those un- dertaken by Julius Pistorius and Jan Boeyens. Both have investigated large stone-walled, agglomerated settlements, which represent the final stage of a process that began in this area in the late eighteenth century as a significant proportion of the population of some chiefdoms aggregated at single 'towns', at least in part for reasons of self-defence within an increasingly competitive political environment. Examples include Molokwane, capital of a Kwena chiefdom,s8 and Kaditshwene, capital of a major section of the Hurutshe and, when visited by John Campbell in 1820, the same size as contemporaneous Cape Town; after prolonged debate the latter site is now firmly located some 25 km northeast of Zeerust."2 In the Marico area, this late stage in the region's archaeological record emerges from an earlier phase of settle- ment, without stone walls and dating from the mid-fifteenth century. Around 1700 western Sotho-Tswana communities such as the Kwena moved into the Rustenburg-Pretoria area, where previously communities of the 78 J. J. B.

Simon Hall's synthesis of the Sotho-Tswana sequence83 argues that the initial appearance of stone walls in the early 1 6oos to demarcate livestock pens, households and homesteads was part of a pro- cess whereby kin group membership came to be reckoned more exclusively and claims to the landscape were more strongly asserted. As competition for grazing, arable land and trade goods increased, he identifies changes in activity location within households that may reflect increasingly compart- mentalized gender roles. At the same time, male activities such as metal- working and hide preparation were intensified in discrete areas near the chief's court, indicating a growing degree of centralized control.84 Ceramics also became more standardized and less elaborately decorated, while bowl frequencies declined. Hall interprets these changes in terms of increased time pressures on women's labour, and efforts by men to emphasize control over production by using wooden (male) rather than ceramic (female) vessels at mealtimes. More recent work suggests that some aspects of this scenario may need revision. Boeyens, for example, working in the Marico area of North-West Province, is, like Huffman, able to demonstrate good correlations between Tswana oral traditions and archaeologically inferred settlement histories.85 He suggests, however, that the elaboration of stone walling and a shift of settlement toward hillsides and spurs in the later seventeenth century coin- cided with the end of a warmer, wetter spell within the Little Ice Age, as well as with population movements recorded in oral histories. Subsequently, late eighteenth- to early nineteenth-century aggregation into the large settle- ments encountered by the first Europeans to travel in the region probably resulted from the interaction of several factors: periodic drought, the accumulation of wealth in cattle and centralization of power, and not just from conflict or population growth. Maize, as we discuss below, cannot have fuelled the latter as it seems to have gained importance only in the I820s, while archaeological evidence for participation in long-distance trade, which is well attested in early European accounts, remains disappointingly small; glass beads have been recovered only in limited quantities from late Tswana sites, despite their supply of ivory to traders linked to the Indian Ocean coast.86 Multiple causes are also likely to lie behind the many abandoned settlements noted by early European observers: while clearly in part a consequence of the disturbances associated with the Difaqane, they also reflect embedded features of Tswana land-use, especially the movement of 83 S.

Their sites may first appear in the Waterberg as early as the sixteenth century, but certainly by the mid-seventeenth, accompanied by Nguni-type pottery and beehive houses.88 In the Polokwane and Mokopane areas, how- ever, Nguni groups used both Moloko and a variant of Letaba (Venda) pottery from the I6oos, reflecting the diverse associations recorded in the complex body of oral traditions that link Northern (Transvaal) Ndebele communities to the lowveld east of the Drakensberg escarpment. Economic hardship and political fragmentation after the I820s are manifest in the smaller size and 'imploded' form of later Northern Ndebele settlements, while their house form changed from beehive to stone-walled cone-on- cylinder." Further south and from before I700, the Ndzundza Ndebele of Mpumalanga's Steelpoort Valley used Moloko ceramics like those of their Sotho-speaking Pedi neighbours, but built Nguni-style beehive houses. As on Northern Ndebele sites, middens were capped with red earth, perhaps to prevent the ash deposited in them from being used in malevolent magic. Mzilikazi's Ndebele destroyed the Ndzundza capital in the I820s. At their subsequent centre, Esikhunjini, the Ndzundza continued to use Pedi-style pottery and constructed beehive huts with low mud-plaster walls. Both practices, Alex Schoeman suggests, may have signalled unity with the Pedi with whom the Ndzundza were now aligned. The practice of capping mid- dens was retained."9 The production of pottery in styles associated with Sotho- and Venda-speakers by Ndebele groups contradicts the association of ceramic style and language. However, Nguni decorative styles are simple and the broader relationship between group and material culture is retained in settlement design and the peculiarly Ndebele treatment of midden ash. The 'foreign' ceramics likely reflect the integration of Sotho-speaking women into Ndebele society through marriage and, possibly, tension between Nguni and Sotho perceptions of the marriage contract; by retaining the style, says Schoeman, women created an alternative identity with which they could challenge male social mores. The Doornpoort sites in the central Free State provide another example of merged identity. Here sites with Makgwareng ceramics, derived from the earlier southern Sotho-Tswana style associated with the Fokeng, occur on stone-walled sites with domed (beehive-like) huts and an arrangement 87 Boeyens, 'The Late Iron Age'; P.

Similar sites occur in the Caledon Valley, though by the nineteenth century all major groups here spoke some form of Sesotho. Occupation of the Doornpoort sites ended violently around 1820, by which time the archaeological evidence indicates that their inhabitants were grow- ing maize and had added pigs to their range of animal domesticates.91 This is one of several examples of archaeologists investigating the comparatively recent past of indigenous farming communities. Others include Simon Hall's study of the Lepalong cavern site, in which two Kwena groups sought refuge from Mzilikazi in the I820s and I830s, Kobus Dreyer's excavations on Thaba Bosiu, Lesotho, where evidence of a hitherto unsuspected seven- teenth- to eighteenth-century occupation may be present, Pistorius's identification of an 1830s site in the Magaliesberg associated with Mzilikazi's Ndebele and limited work at known Swazi royal sites.92 Excavations at the former Zulu capitals of Mgungundlovu and Ondini have also been reported, identifying the houses of Kings Dingane kaSenzangakhona and Cetshwayo kaMpande, suggesting preferential royal dietary access to younger animals, and supporting royal control over brass production and girls' initiation rites."93 Further back in the sequence, work at the now-ploughed and much- disturbed I820s site of kwaBulawayo, second capital of the modern icon and founder of the Zulu state Shaka kaSenzangakhona, has shown it to be only half the size of the two later capitals.94 Overall, however, research on this broad period is limited, and there is no doubt much to be learned from more comprehensive research on the formation and development of these early nineteenth-century states, particularly in the case of Swaziland and Lesotho. One area where this might be focused is in exploring further the role played by the adoption of maize in promoting population growth and pressure on resources in the lead-up to the Mfecane (Difaqane). Archaeological and pa- laeoclimatic data have been used to suggest that the increasing cultivation of higher yielding, but less drought-resistant, maize under the wetter condi- tions of the later eighteenth century encouraged a dependence on the new cereal that proved difficult to sustain when faced by severe drought episodes 91 Dreyer, 'The Iron Age'. 92 Hall, 'Archaeological indicators'; J.

However, dependence on maize was clearly not universal, and Boeyens has made a convincing case for its widespread adoption having taken place in the southern and western Tswana chiefdoms only after Mzilikazi's incursions into the region in the early I820s. The limitations of maize in arid conditions did not therefore everywhere contribute to political turmoil and military tension in the first decades after 1800.96 Across the regions which we have been surveying hunter-gatherer communities continued to be present, if often increasingly marginalized, throughout the period in question. The nature of their relations with their farmer neighbours has become an intensively researched question, particu- larly in areas of Lesotho and the central interior of South Africa. In the northern half of the Caledon Valley, for example, analysis of the distribution of the imagery and pigments present in rock paintings suggests that hunter- gatherers were quickly dispossessed or assimilated after the initiation of farming settlement there, probably in the early seventeenth century. Further south, however, in areas where farmers did not penetrate success- fully, paintings of cattle, sheep and Sotho-type shields are found, images that may have been deliberately selected by hunter-gatherer artists as symbols of the supernatural potency tapped by shamans in altered states of conscious- ness.97 At the same time, excavations by Lyn Wadley and her students show a substitution of Sotho-manufactured pottery for grass-tempered Smithfield wares, which suggests that forager ties were refocused on incoming farming communities. Changes in site-use patterns are also evident: the large rock- shelter of Rose Cottage Cave was abandoned in the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries, while many smaller, more ephemerally used shelters remained (expanded ?) in use. In some cases, as at Tandjiesberg, their rich rock art may have helped substitute for the physical coming together of an increasingly dispersed population."9 If this scenario is indeed borne out by future research then it may imply either that farmer settlement of the highveld is, as the Ntsuanatsatsi site suggests, some centuries older than some think and/or that the expansion of farming communities affected hunter-gatherers hundreds of years and hun- dreds of kilometres in advance of the physical implantation of agricultural lifeways on the landscape. These possibilities are reinforced by finds of domesticated sheep and cattle in the uppermost levels at Rose Cottage Cave itself, which most probably do not represent disturbance from 95 Huffman, 'Archaeological evidence'. 96 Boeyens, 'The Late Iron Age'. 97 J.

Such finds point to hunter-gatherer participation in long-distance exchange networks well before the local establishment of farming communities in the I870s. The antiquity of such exchanges is confirmed by an AMS-dated sheep bone from the nearby open-air site of Likoaeng, found in a layer, dating to the late eighth century, that also yielded a decorated Ndondondwane (possibly Msuluzi) potsherd and other rare sheep and cattle bones.1"' Such finds raise the possibility that hunter-gatherers in the Drakensberg were able to obtain and retain livestock, just as has been suggested by Sadr for the Cape.102 The acqusition of ceramic technology by hunter-gatherers in southeastern southern Africa provides a further parallel between these two research areas. A review by Aron Mazel confirmed that these typically grit-tempered wares are quite different from any known Chifumbaze ceramics and suggested that their initial introduction might lie in the last few first centuries BC. Safer evidence comes from Collingham Shelter, where they seem securely dated by a subsequent roof collapse to between the first and fourth centuries AD and may be associated with iron and copper beads. Neither the origins of this pottery (perhaps via a northeastward expansion from the Cape, an otherwise unsubstantiated herder/farmer movement across the former Transvaal, or diffusion south ahead of the Chifumbaze spread along the East African coast) nor its uses are well understood, but it seems to have spread across KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho and adjacent areas quite rapidly.103 The precise nature of the interactions that may have taken place between hunter-gatherers and farmers is difficult to establish from purely archaeo- logical data, and the development of some form of patron-client relations has been explored by several scholars. Two examples include the work of Maria van der Ryst on the Waterberg Plateau and of Mazel in the Thukela Basin, where farmers made use of many of the same rock-shelters as 99 I. Plug and R.

It matches almost exactly a second, charcoal determination for the same layer (Pta-7877, 131 o ? 80 BP, calibrating to CAL AD 670 [769] 874), as well as the likely age of the decorated sherd; AMS dating of iron from the same layer is underway (Stephan Woodborne, pers. comm.). 102 Sadr, 'First herders'. 103 A.

The late David Hammond-Tooke, for example, argued forcefully for Bushman shamanistic beliefs lying at the heart of Nguni divination practises, while Ouzman has drawn parallels between Bushman and Tswana rain-making ideas.7"' Genetic and linguistic data have, of course, long argued for the partial assimilation of Khoisan hunter-gatherers and, in the Eastern Cape at least, herders into Bantu-speaking societies. What is not obvious is the time depth of these processes and there is an urgent need to address this question, not least because of its impact on understanding differences between first and second millennium farmers themselves. We have already mentioned rock art evidence more than once, and there can be no question that southernmost Africa's many rock engravings and paintings provide a wealth of information about the region's history, and specifically the social and ideological relations of past societies. Maggs highlights a 'neglected' aspect of this art, engravings by farmers depicting settlement plans. Since throughout southern Africa the homestead stands for a properly ordered world, the engravings may be considered maps in the sense that they facilitate a spatial understanding of the human world, even though there is no evidence that they represented actual settlements. The engravings occur in grasslands or in savanna areas on the margins of grass- lands, and were associated with stone-built settlements in these areas. Thematically, the male world (cattle pens, cattle tracks) is strongly empha- sized; even in areas where stone-built field systems would likely have absorbed considerable male labour, this female-associated element is omitted in the engravings. It seems likely that most were the work of boys and young men.108 As well as initiating much more sophisticated work on the rock arts 104 Van der Ryst, The Waterberg Plateau; A. D.

Jolly, for example, has controversially argued that key scenes interpreted by the Bushman informant Qing in 1873 actually re- flect Nguni and Sotho influences on Drakensberg hunter-gatherer com- munities. Also making extensive use of Qing's statements, Anne Solomon has argued forcefully for understanding the art in terms of Bushman beliefs about gender relations, employed phenomenological and art historical in- sights to examine issues of theme and form and used mythology to bind the art more closely to the lived experience of past Bushman communities. Finally, Parkington, working in the Western Cape, has also emphasized gender, as well as the spatial ordering of motifs within scenes and beliefs about the control of weather, while several authors have begun examining the significance of various animal species using ethnological, as well as ethnographic, data.112 Though debate has sometimes been strong, 109 Examples include F.

Impressively detailed correlations between historical records, many of them newly located, and specific rock art sites in the Maclear region of South Africa's Eastern Cape Province have been examined by Geoff Blundell, Nqabayo's Nomansland: San Rock Art and the Somatic Past (Uppsala, 2004).

Ouzman, 'Worlds within stone: the inner and outer rock-art landscapes of northern Australia and southern Africa', in C. Chippindale and G.

Blundell in the same volume, 'Dangerous ground: a critique of landscape in rock-art studies', 239-62, takes a more cautious approach to the possibilities of understanding the cultural landscape which rock art helped create. 112 See, for example, P.

We also note an increased interest in bringing the evidence of parietal and excavated deposits together, whether in the work of Hall and Smith in Limpopo Province that we consider below, or in the Caledon Valley, where a fine example of producing a 'history in paint and stone' is provided by Ouzman and Wadley's identification of Rose Cottage Cave as an aggregation centre during the period before 1400.11' The slow but steady progress114 being made from detailed examination of rock art style and stratigraphy, investigation of pigment sources and direct and indirect AMS dating of paintings offers hope of developing a more robust chronology for southern African rock art that will in turn permit correspondences and disjunctions with excavated and field survey evidence to be made more readily. THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF INDIGENOUS STATES: SCHRODA, K2, MAPUNGUBWE AND THULAMELA An area of the archaeology of indigenous farming communities that we have not yet addressed, but which has received sustained attention over the past decade and more, is the archaeology of southern Africa's first indigenous states. Centred in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin near the juncture of South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, this work has most recently been reviewed in a special issue of the South African Archaeological Society Goodwin Series."5' Many of the comments that we make draw upon papers published there, but they are by no means alone in offering important new information on the developments focused around the three successive centres of Schroda, K2 and Mapungubwe, the significance of which has recently been recognized by their designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In particular, we note the detailed publication of the work undertaken at Mapungubwe by the University of Pretoria, and Tom Huffman's increasingly well-developed and convincing arguments that the pattern of spatially segregated sacred lead- ership and social stratification into distinct noble and commoner classes that marks the Zimbabwe Culture had its origins in the social transformations that preceded the shift of the capital from K2 to the neighbouring site of 'Capturing the spoor: towards explaining kudu in San rock art of the Limpopo-Shashi confluence area', South African Archaeological Bulletin, 54 (1999), 107-19. 113 S.

Although there is evidence of a farmer presence in the Shashe-Limpopo area in the early first millennium AD, a long lacuna in occupation seems to have followed before Zhizo communities settled there around 900. The abundant elephant herds sustained by the area's mopane vegetation and the opportunities that they offered for trading ivory to the Indian Ocean coast were probably a principal attraction.117 Arabic documents indicate that in the tenth century Swahili traders had identified a new source of ivory in southern Mozambique. Within the Shashe-Limpopo Basin the site of Schroda has yielded a considerable quantity of worked ivory, cowrie shells and the remains of carnivores that possibly provided pelts for export. It was undoubtedly heavily involved in the trade, as is also indicated by Marilee Wood's analysis of the imported glass beads found there and at other Zhizo sites. These beads also occur at Chibuene, an early port in southern Mozambique lying at roughly the same latitude as Schroda, that has pro- vided evidence of trading connections with the Islamic Middle East.118 Schroda is the largest tenth-century site in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin and was almost certainly the Zhizo capital there. This is supported by the many fragments of ceramic figurines recovered from the site, most of which were broken prior to deposition. One excavation unit adjacent to a cattle pen produced over 2,000 fragments, many in distinct clusters.119 The Schroda figurines can be divided into two categories. Those found near the cattle pen would have been employed in initiation rituals organized by the chief, and can be further divided into two sub-sets. One sub-set was made of coarse clay and consists of relatively large anthropomorphic figures, non-domestic and fantasy animals (including birds) and phallic shapes. The second, made of fine clay, includes smaller models of domestic animals and phalli. The two sub-sets were for the most part spatially separated on site by a fence line. The second category of figurine comprises a particular stylized female form that occurred widely across the site. These were probably fertility 'dolls' kept by girls and women in domestic contexts. 116 T. N. Huffman, Snakes and Crocodiles: Power and Symbolism in Ancient Zimbabwe (Johannesburg, 1996); A.

However, fieldwork by John Calabrese has now shown that not all Zhizo people left the Shashe-Limpopo area in the early eleventh century. While the major increase in Toutswe Tradition settlements in eastern Botswana after Iooo may well reflect such an emigration, excavations at Leokwe Hill indi- cate that a Zhizo-related pottery style, called Leokwe, continued to be made in the Shashe-Limpopo area until around 1200oo. Although the radiocarbon chronology is not sufficiently precise to establish or exclude this for certain, it is possible that this occupation was, in part, contemporaneous with a K2 one on the higher (elite-associated) parts of the site.120 Whatever the case, other Leokwe sites have now been discovered and the contemporaneity of Leokwe and Kz in the same area for the best part of 200 years implies a more complex sociopolitical situation than has previously been suspected. Indeed, this is the first time that ethnicity has been identified in the archaeology of pre- colonial agriculturists in southern Africa. Meanwhile, ground survey on the eastern fringes of the Kalahari has established a more complex picture of Taukome and Toustwe settlement than provided by earlier work. Developments here seem, however, to have occurred largely in response to the emergence of a class-based society in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin.121 Sociopolitical complexity is also revealed by another aspect of Calabrese's research, which examined patterning in the manufacture and control of metallurgical technologies in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin.122 Though he suggested that smelting might have taken place at Schroda, Kz and Mapungubwe, Duncan Miller notes that, for the two later sites at least, this is unlikely on the basis of the available archaeological and geological evi- dence. Since the same reasoning is used for Schroda, for which far better records are available, we remain hesitant about metal production there too. However, Miller's archaeometallurgical study does demonstrate that metal working occurred at both Kz (c. 1030-122o) and Mapungubwe (c. 1220-13oo00), primarily to produce iron, copper and gold jewellery.123 The product was overwhelmingly concentrated at these two elite sites compared to the commoner settlements surrounding them, which had virtually no access to finished, non-utilitarian metal items. Explaining this, Calabrese argues that strong links existed between political leadership, metallurgy and associated beliefs about human fertility. Interestingly, the spatial expression of this relationship is perhaps evident in KwaZulu-Natal in first millennium 120 J. A.

Only iron and copper residues and objects occur at K2, but at Mapungubwe gold, bronze and brass were, for the first time in southern Africa, added to the corpus of metals worked.124 Smiths applied existing techniques to the new raw materials, but added the production of gold shot to their repertoire for making punched beads. They also made gold sheet that could be attached to wooden objects (the Mapungubwe rhinoceros, for example) with small gold tacks. This decorat- ive technique was later applied to bronze at Thulamela. Interestingly, some items - finger rings, solid bangles and chains - were made only in copper and iron even after the advent of gold working. On Mapungubwe Hill there was 'copious' evidence of copper working, a location indicating that copper working at Mapungubwe was a secluded, probably highly ritualized, activity under tight political control. This was certainly the case for gold too, if we consider the amount of jewellery associated with the elite burials on Mapungubwe Hill. All of these metals, as well as iron, are exotic to the Shashe-Limpopo area, raising questions about the kind of social and political relations that were involved in their acquistion and trade. Indeed, the brass, and probably also the bronze, were likely of Indian manufacture, raising yet to be resolved questions about the role that their availability as exotic alloys may have played in the development of an indigenous tradition of bronze production and in the exploitation of indigenous tin sources in the Rooiberg range, from which at least 18,ooo tonnes of ore were removed in precolonial times, most of it probably destined for export across the Indian Ocean.125 As these few remarks suggest, archaeometallurgical research increasingly emphasizes the study of metal production, the adoption of new techniques (such as casting) and the working of new metals (gold, bronze, brass) within the context of broader social and political transformations such as state formation. Equally interesting is the possibility that one motivation for developing a competence in gold and bronze working - now revealed to have been on a much more substantial scale than previously suspected - was the symbolic identification of yellow metal with royalty. Finally, we note advances in the sourcing of metals, notably trace element analyses that show that at least two sources were used at Mapungubwe, one of which was shared with Thulamela, while gold from Bosutswe, a Toutswe site in Botswana, had yet other origins.126 The availability of hitherto unimaginable quantities of imported items is, of course, a hallmark of K2 and Mapungubwe. This, and the archaeological evidence of ivory manufacture at K2 and of gold working at Mapungubwe, have helped focus interpretation on the role of such imports, especially glass beads, in lubricating a prestige goods economy that supplied merchants on 124 Ibid. 125 M.R.

In particular, the distinctive Oblate series found in the Mapungubwe period has yet to be identified from the East African coast, while chemical analyses of Mapungubwe period beads point provisionally to origins in South Asia, raising, as with the finds of brass and bronze from Mapungubwe Hill itself, the possibility of direct or indirect trading connections between southern Africa and the Indian sub-continent rather than the traditionally assumed orientation toward the Middle East.128 As well as the wealth gained from this trade and, no doubt, from controlling large herds of cattle, another factor in the political aggrandizement of the leaders of the K2 and Mapungubwe polities may have been the opportunities for floodplain agriculture provided by the particular combination of riverine and topographical features in the Shashe-Limpopo Basin. This possibility is enhanced if, as Janette Smith's ongoing doctoral research129 implies, conditions were generally-but not uniformally - wetter than today for much of the early second millennium. Indeed, periodic flooding and nutrient enrichment must have occurred to support the level of cultivation necessary for the dramatically increased population in the area from K2 times onwards. Smith's conclusion that such wetter conditions continued until as late as i375 does, however, require a revision of the earlier notion that it was the onset of the Little Ice Age about 1290 that was instrumental in provoking the collapse of Mapungubwe and a shift of political power to Great Zimbabwe.130 Purely political and/or econ- omic factors, some of which may lie beyond the resolution of archaeological evidence, were probably operating instead. Often overlooked or stereoptyped in previous discussions of the Shashe- Limpopo archaeological record has been the role played by hunter-gatherer groups at this time. This has been a specific concern of work undertaken by Simon Hall, Ben Smith and others, who have shown that hunter-gatherer settlement of the Limpopo Valley intensified in the early first millennium AD, perhaps attracted by the possibilities of engaging in exchange with newly settling farmers; hides and wild meat may have been among the products that they could provide.1'1 A quite different scale of interaction followed the establishment of Zhizo farmers in dense numbers in the Limpopo Valley around 900. Foragers were probably increasingly constrained in their use of the landscape and perhaps allowed, or encouraged, to supply raw materials and/or labour for the farmer economy. Intensification of local and long- distance trade and elite control of the production that this entailed seems to have relegated hunter-gatherers to the economic and political margins. 127 Rare examples of Sung Dynasty Chinese pottery have also now been published from the Mapungubwe excavations, see A. Meyer and V. Esterhuizen, 'Skerwe uit die verlede: handel tussen Mapungubwe en China', South African Journal of Ethnology, 17 (1994), 103-8. 128 Wood, 'Making connections'. 129 Janette Smith, pers. comm. 130 Huffman, 'Mapungubwe'. This revision of the local palaeoclimatic record fits more comfortably with the archaeological evidence for the continued presence of a Mapungubwe-derived population elsewhere in the region until the late fourteenth century, as discussed by Meyer, Archaeological. 131 Hall and Smith, 'Empowering places'.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY OF SOUTHERNMOST AFRICA 241 Their former roles may have been taken over by K2/Mapungubwe com- moners and at least some of their sites, such as Little Muck Shelter, were appropriated by farmers. This change is reflected in both the excavated record and, probably after 13oo, by the production of so-called 'late white' paintings that frequently overprint earlier hunter-gatherer art. As we have indicated, Mapungubwe was replaced as the major centre of political power in the region by Great Zimbabwe. The archaeological record that speaks to the ensuing phases of the Zimbabwe Culture in this northern part of South Africa has remained comparatively unchanged since I991, although significant interpretive strides have occurred in our understanding of the sequence. An addition of particular interest is the site of Thulamela in the far north of the Kruger National Park.132 As is typical of sites of the Zimbabwe Culture, the core area of this settlement, located at its highest point, features several stone-walled enclosures, beyond which lie non-walled residential areas. The first phase of activity dates to the early fifteenth century and has pottery distantly related to that of Zimbabwe Class 3 (Period III). Around 1440 ceramics similar to those from Great Zimbabwe appear and extensive stone walls were built, indicating an elite settlement. This is also reflected in the glass beads, seashells and evidence of gold and ivory working on the site. This Khami occupation continued until the site was abandoned c. 1640. Two elite burials were found at Thulamela, one of a woman buried in a foetal position dating probably to the i6oos, the other comprising the disarticulated remains of a man dating to the first half of the I400s. The woman was buried prior to the end of the occupation, but the male remains were moved to the site from a resting place elsewhere and a solid daga hut was constructed above the grave. This event either ended the occupation or happened sometime afterwards. It is likely that the man was one of the original leaders of the dynasty, perhaps even the founding leader, who possibly lived at an earlier settlement called Makahanye.133 Both individuals were subsequently reburied in accordance with the wishes of the local community, one of the first instances of its kind in South Africa. This action has proven to be a harbinger of the much closer, if not always easy, ties beginning to unfold between archaeologists and the communities whose past they investigate in the post-apartheid era. One of many further extremely welcome developments in this respect is the slowly increasing presence of black South Africans in the country's archaeological structures, including heritage management bodies and museums, as well as among undergraduate and graduate student bodies. We look forward to the next review in this series being able to report on their work, and on that of their colleagues now in training from neighbouring countries. 132 A.
