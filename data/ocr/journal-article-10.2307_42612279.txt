<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pusey as consistent and wise: Some comparisons with Newman* David Brown To describe Edward Bouverie Pusey in the words of my title is a verdict that many would have prepared to endorse during Pusey's own lifetime and perhaps still more so after his death once they had read Liddon's four volumed biography. Two centuries on from his birth, though, and a quite different estimate is now commonplace. His apparently unyielding conservatism on so many issues is used to suggest an unthinking reactionary, the very opposite of a wise or creative mind. Not only that, even his consistency has been contested, as more recent scholarship has challenged Liddon's estimate of his move away from his earlier liberalism as natural and inevitable into one where it is made a response of fear or at best a puzzle. The result is that of all the various figures in the Oxford Movement and its immediate aftermath it is Pusey's reputation that has suffered the greatest decline. That this is in part justified I would not deny. Nonetheless, what I hope to show in the pages that follow is that, once a more suitable, alternative grid for interpretation is found, Pusey can indeed emerge as in general consistent and in key respects also wise. That is to say, he will be found not only to have had consistent concerns throughout his life that span both its early liberal phrase and thereafter but also in response to those concerns to have made some wise moves that in the light of more recent theological trends ♦This article is based on the Pusey Bicentennial Lecture given in the Trinity Term at Oxford in 2000, to mark his birth on 22 August 1800.

That last contention may seem on first reflection quite absurd, but it is important that when Pusey's style is so turgid and disorganised and Newman's so marvellously lucid and seductive we do not confuse presentation with content. To establish my claim, I shall offer first a general sketch of the problem as I see it, and thereafter three detailed points of comparison with Newman. FINDING A FRAMEWORK H.P. Liddon thought that he had just such a framework, and it is into this that he fits Pusey's two trips to Germany (in 1825 and 1826) and subsequent defense of German theology in the face of H.J. Rose's criticisms in his Theology of Germany} Neither the trips nor the work were indicative, he suggests, of any real engagement with liberal theology and its concerns but rather all part of the equipping of the future scholar with the necessary tools that would make him become the bastion of a conservative and catholic vision for the Church of England. German theologians, Liddon writes, "could not give that which they did not themselves possess; it was their business, in the order of Divine Providence, to till and fertilize the soil for its reception."2 So, although some wrong influences are conceded, these are held to be essentially superficial, and so quickly later retracted. Indeed, Theology of Germany is viewed as fundamentally not about Germany nor liberal theology at all but rather about the current state of the Church in England. "Pusey was thinking less of Germany than of England"; it was the modest methods employed by a young man of twenty-eight to say that "the attitude of the English high and dry churchmen towards spiritual religion, and the attitude of the English evangelicals towards theological knowledge, were not without peril to the faith, and that the experience of Protestant 1 The full title was An Historical Enquiry into the Probable Causes of the Rationalist Character Lately Predominant in Theology of Germany.

Vol. I, (London, 1893), 1 14.</page><page sequence="3">330 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY Germany, in circumstances different yet analogous, might not improbably be repeated at home."3 That is to say, Pusey was never interested in liberal theology as such but only as a challenge to dry and clinical orthodoxy that placed accuracy of belief above real spiritual life in the church. Since the Second World War, though, that assessment has become increasingly subject to challenge. There are too many indicators, it is suggested, of deep and underlying support for liberal ideas and their advocates in their own right for this to be a plausible reading. On the contrary, the work of the Cambridge trio, Lightfoot, Hort and Westcott, might well have been antici- pated a quarter of a century or more earlier by the assiduous endeavours of Pusey at Oxford, had only he stuck to his guns. But instead what we find is an almost total contrast and contradiction between his youthful enthusiasm for German biblical criticism and his later anglo-catholicism. The brilliant young scholar who went to study in Germany and who could have been one of the greatest, if not perhaps the greatest, biblical scholar of his generation instead turned his back on such possibilities in order to defend a whole series of reactionary causes.4 It is this interpretation that has been argued at length in David Forrester's study of Young Doctor Pusey. Rightly or wrongly, he accuses Liddon of deliberately concealing some of the relevant evidence, whereas all that may be happening is Liddon' s failure to appreciate its significance.5 However, what cannot be questioned is Forrester's success in establishing a very different mind and intention in Pusey at this stage of his life from later. The kind of 3 Ibid., 164-65. 4 The lost potential is stressed by, among others, Geoffrey Best and Colin Matthew; for the former, "A Letter from Bishop Maltby" in Theology 61 (1958), 17-22, esp., 19-20; for the latter, "Edward Bouverie Pusey: from Scholar to Tractarian" in Journal of Theological Studies 32 (1981), 101-24, esp. 112, 123. I am grateful to David Galilee for initially setting me the challenge of trying to discover whether there was in fact after all some continuity. 5 For the accusation, D. Forrester, Young Doctor Pusey (London, 1989), xiv; for a good example of the fault, Ibid., 41 and 236, fn.36. Nonetheless, Liddon may have been motivated by no stronger reason than suppositions about irrelevance to his theme.</page><page sequence="4">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 33 1 continuity advocated by Liddon simply does not exist. Pusey's liberal phase was deep and real, and amounted to considerably more than mere admiration for the moral character of some of its exponents (which Liddon concedes). That, though, then leaves Forrester with the issue of how the change is to be explained. His solution is to point to "the combined pressure of personal events, and gradual disillusionment with the direction that national affairs were taking."6 On the personal front, as well as the death of his father and his personal patron, Bishop Lloyd, in the late 1820s, the latter of whom had encouraged his visits to Germany in the first place, there were also Pusey's complex relations with his wife and young family, with him blaming his own sins for the death of daughter Katherine in 1832. Then, politically there was his change of mind, and sense that liberal politics now represented the greatest danger to the church.7 What, though, remains unsatisfactory about such an analysis is that it suggests someone swept along, as it were, by the accidents of history. The discontinuities become far more obvious than the continuities, and Pusey becomes someone jerked into reaction by circumstance rather than creatively responding to new situations. In response Forrester might well draw our attention to how indecisive Pusey could be,8 for that could indicate someone who did not really know his own mind. Yet, I think that there is more to be said on the other side, and that continuities, though of quite a different kind from Liddon's, do after all exist. This is not to say that they are obvious. Nor could they be, given the extent of the contrast between Pusey's earlier and later views. Indeed, to help explain why underlying continuities of the type I am about to mention have not hitherto been noticed, it might help if at this point the nature of the contrast is stated as sharply and as clearly as possible. 6 Ibid., 50. 7 Ibid., 63-65. Pusey had earlier reacted against his father's Toryism, and supported a Whig viewpoint. 8 Ibid., 84. He notes how wrong Newman was in describing Pusey as possessing "confidence in his position."</page><page sequence="5">332 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY His earlier liberalism can scarcely be in doubt. From Theology of Germany itself one discovers that if Pusey has little sympathy for Kant, he was prepared to offer considerable praise for Schleiermacher and even indeed for Lessing, who despite his pantheism is credited with teaching the church some important lessons.9 One notes, too, in his concern to avoid "the substitution of human technicalities for the free spirit of the Gospel," he does not hesitate to reject the view that the whole of scripture was immediately dictated by the Holy Spirit, and to substitute in its place not only an acknowledgement of growth within its pages but also acceptance of "the beautiful arrangement" whereby "different doctrines of revelation are each prominently conveyed by that mind which was adapted to its reception."10 More radical expression of such ideas is also to be found in some of Pusey's letters of the time. For instance, in a private letter to his future wife, Maria Barker, he observes: "I cannot then think that while our Saviour was upon earth, it could have been by any believed that He was 'God manifest in the flesh'; it seems to me too tremendous to have been known, nor then useful."11 By contrast, Pusey's later views do by most standards emerge as those of an unqualified reactionary. Ironically, this seems true even if the measuring rod is that of the Oxford Movement of which he was for so long the leader. Thus, despite advice to the contrary, when planning the building of St. Saviour's, Leeds he insisted that current convention be followed, and tablets recording the Apostles Creed, the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments 9 Schleiermacher is described as "that great man who, whatever the errors of his system, has done more than (some very few perhaps excepted) any other, to the restoration of religious belief in Germany": Theology of Germany , Pt. I, 1 15, fn. 1. Lessing "rendered considerable services to Christianity," not least in emphasizing the partial and preparatory character of the Old Testament and "the limits of the empire of reason": Pt. I, 155-57. Kant's God, though, is seen as too "grossly anthropomorphic" and so the benefits of his system are largely negative, by way of reaction: Pt. I, 161-66. 10 Ibid., 22, 30. 11 Letter of 18 November 1827, quoted in Forrester, Young Doctor Pusey, 40-41.

So, for instance, his detailed arguments in favour of the real presence of Christ in the eucharist turn less on the nature of the sacrament as such and more on quasi-legal appeals to the meaning of sixteenth-century texts, such the Book of Homilies and the Thirty-nine Articles.13 A charitable interpretation of such acts might possibly take them merely to indicate the desire to avoid unnecessary disputes, but in fact Pusey is found entering the fray on the conservative side on numerous occasions. So, for instance, in marked contrast to Newman's Idea of a University , he wanted Oxford to stay essentially as it was, and so, although he did urge reform, it was a reform quite narrowly based in terms of a better education for the clergy.14 Again, he opposed the abolition of the reciting of the Athanasian creed, vehemently affirming its damnatory clauses and thus the reality of hell as a place of eternal punishment.15 Then, as his commentary on Daniel indicates, we also find him fighting a rearguard action 12 Liddon, Life of Pusey Vol. II (London, 1893), 476-77. 13 There were of course good reasons for this: he wanted to establish the notion of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist as the doctrine of the Church of England. But the result is highly complex and, some would say, over-subtle distinctions. So, for instance, in his The Real Presence : The Doctrine of the English Church (Oxford, 1857), in order to establish that it is a legitimate Anglican position, he feels he has to appeal to Cranmer's earlier views as reflected in the Homilies (so 4-5, 10-1 1), and argue that an apparendy hostile Article (XXVIII) be interpreted in the light of Parker's omission of a still more unwelcome declaration in the earlier Forty-two Articles (cf. 202). 14 Seen, for instance, in his Remarks on the Prospective and Past Benefits of Cathedral Institutions (London, 1833), and in his subsequent campaigns in favour of a strong tutorial and lecture system, but against any widening of the University base. His attempt to have Jowett censured for unsound teaching in 1862 should also be noted. Yet the undoubted merits of his 1833 proposals should not be discounted; for a helpful analysis, D. Galilee, "Pusey: A Forgotten Text?" in Theology 78 (1975), 196-202. 15 His fight to retain the Athanasian Creed particularly occupied his efforts between 1870 and 1873. His book What is Faith as to Everlasting Punishment ? (Oxford, 1880) appeared in response to F. W. Farrar's denial of the doctrine.</page><page sequence="7">334 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY in defense of the literal truth of scripture,16 and in fact he even objected to publication of the Revised Version of the Bible in 1881. 17 In this his position was not all that far removed from modern fundamentalism, and that despite all his earlier interest in German scholarship. So it would not be hard to argue and give plausible justification for the view that the later Pusey is simply someone running scared of any challenge to traditional positions. A natural temptation in this situation might well therefore be to turn to Newman for some welcome relief. Admittedly, in our contemporary culture he does seem initially to have all the advantages, for his notion of development sounds excitingly progressive and modern. "In a higher world it is otherwise; but here below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often."18 Not only that, his favourite images are of organic growth,19 and so suggest that such developments as occur in the history of the church are essentially natural workings out of what is already implicit in the system rather than extraneous impositions. However, on the other side does not a question mark need to be set against Newman's supreme optimism about how easily the church can pass from one stage to the next?20 It all seems to resonate too much of Victorian over-confidence in the inevitability of progress, and so, far from setting the authority 16 Daniel the Prophet (Oxford, 1864). Although intended to shake confidence in the results of biblical criticism, his critique has failed to carry conviction. 17 Liddon quotes a key letter to Dean Lake of Durham: Life of Pusey Vol. IV (London, 1898), 367-69. While one sympathizes with Pusey's complaint against the view that the attempt should always be made to translate the same Greek word in the same way, his anx- iety for doctrinal purity over against textual integrity seems a less commendable concern. 18 Essay on Development , ed. J. M. Cameron (London, 1974), 100. 19 "The most ready test is suggested by the analogy of physical growth" is how he opens the discussion of his proposed tests, and similar analogies follow: 1 17; cf. e. g. 130, 142. This is to reject the now common contention that it is really personal analogies that are central to Newman's thought: e. g. W. J. Kelly, "The doctrine of development: another look at the underlying image" inj. Bastable ed., Newman and, Gladstone: Centennial Essays (Dublin, 1978), 89-113. 20 It might be thought that Newman's readiness to concede that orthodoxy was some- times in a minority tells against this criticism, but on the other side one notes his supreme confidence that even under such circumstances nothing could go really badly wrong.</page><page sequence="8">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 335 of Rome over the world, in effect he seems to make his adopted church ape secular assumptions. By contrast, Pusey's greater pessimism and deep sense of human sinfulness makes him the more uncharacteristic figure. Were that all we could say in his defense it would not amount to much, but there are, I want to suggest, a number of principles running throughout Pusey's theology, even including his liberal period, that could well open up for us today an approach to the church's past that would allow us to take with full seriousness the much more turbulent account of the development of Christian doctrine that biblical critics and church historians are now forcing upon us. If that explains why I am prepared to describe Pusey as "wise", it is because three of those underlying themes span across the apparent great divide between his Theology in Germany and his later seemingly intractable conservatism that I want to call him "consistent." It is to these three themes and their comparative standing in the thought of Newman that I want now to turn. OVER-DEFINITION AND THE DULLING OF THE RELIGIOUS SENSE The first is his emphasis on human fallibility, as much within the church as outside it, and what he sees as the resultant tendency to presume to a degree of knowledge and certainty over detail that is not properly ours. One of the most significant elements in that early work was the way in which he blames the rise of German rationalism on too much doctrinal definition in post-Luther Lutheranism, and not on the use of reason as such. Through its insistence that "the same doctrinal word, wherever it occurred, was employed in the same sense" Protestant scholasticism had in effect made the scriptures "a dead repository of barren technicalities," and so made a reaction inevitable. For, as he observes, "such a system could not endure; it contained within itself the seeds of its own dissolution."21 From the perspective of his future thinking, particularly interesting is the 21 Theology of Germany , Pt. I, 31, 49. One notes that the objection to a single uniform translation of the same foreign word recurs in his objections to the Revised Version of the Bible (Oxford, 1881): cf. fn. 17 above.</page><page sequence="9">336 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY way in which Pusey several times alludes to the folly of supposing the teaching of the Old Testament and the New to be essentially the same. In particular, he chides the critics of the seventeenth- century theologian Georg Calixtus for accusing him of Arianism simply "because he thought that the doctrine of the Trinity was not revealed with equal clearness in the Old as in the New Testament."22 What worries him is the way in which orthodox, imposed readings not only distort the original meaning of the text but also, perhaps more importantly, subvert its life and vitality. These days Pusey is often derided for the severity of the ascetic practices that he eventually came to adopt, and some of them must at least be questioned. His decision after his wife's death never to smile again is an obvious case in point.23 Even so, what his severe lifestyle did ensure was a realistic estimate of the extent of human sinfulness and thus of the inevitability of human fallibility, even in the church and whatever branch one might take. In this context it is particularly instructive to study his Eirenikon , his series of exchanges with Newman long after he had become a Roman Catholic and shortly before the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870.24 Among other things Pusey not only objects to the recently declared dogma of the Immaculate Conception, but also quotes numerous instances where dignities are ascribed to Mary, or saints requested to act, in a manner that he feels can only be described as usurping the divine prerogative. At most what he insists we should be doing is asking for their prayers. Newman's response in terms of a natural excess in 22 Ibid., 61. 23 In response to his wife's death in 1839, which he interpreted as a divine judgement on himself, he declared that he was "scarred all over and seamed with sin... like one covered with leprosy from head to foot": Liddon, Life of Pusey Vol. Ill (London, 1894), 96-97. He subsequently refused all social engagements until 1846, and in a letter to Keble in that same year questioned whether it was right even to smile in greeting to another: Letter of 9 December. 24 The first in 1865 was actually addressed to Keble, but Newman responded, and Pusey wrote two further such documents, in 1869 and 1870. For Mary usurping the prerogatives of God alone, Eirenikon (London, 1866), I, 150-90.</page><page sequence="10">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 337 devotional piety can scarcely be judged adequate, given the fact that many of the statements Pusey quotes come from those who have been canonised,25 and so in effect what Pusey appears to have shown is that the problem runs very much deeper than Newman allows. Even those defined as saints can seriously err, and so far from greater definition securing a deeper spirituality it can in fact contribute towards its further corruption. The canonised examples of wrong turns are already there to hand. The same pattern of argument is also to be found in some of Pusey's earlier works, written while Newman was still an Anglican. On the subject of transubstantiation Pusey took the view that it was a crude literalism that actually endangered the full sense of Christ being present under the elements. That is to say, it so focused on the seen as a presence to be adored that sight was lost of the more fundamental reality of an unseen presence working to unite us into Christ's own humanity, and so prepare us for a fuller life with him in heaven.26 As his famous 1843 sermon succinctly expresses it, "this divine sacrament has, as its immediate and proper end, union with him who hath taken our manhood into God, and the infusion into us of his Spirit and life and immortality, making us one with his glorified humanity, as he is one in the Godhead with the Father".27 One notes too his reaction to the Gorham Judgement on baptismal regeneration in 1850. Some of similar persuasion to himself on the matter wanted a closer 25 Extreme language in St. Bernadine and St. Alphonsus Liguori is defended by Newman on the grounds that "devotion is free": Letters and Diaries , ed. C. S. Dessain et al. (Oxford, 1961), XXII, 90. 26 That is one of the main points that he makes in his 1853 sermon, The Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist , in favour of patristic understandings, and against medieval: published as Sermon IV in his Nine Sermons preached, before the University of Oxford (London, 1865, see esp. 41-47). In his Real Presence: The Doctrine of the English Church (Oxford, 1857) he also attacks "consubstantiation" as a parodying of the Lutheran view, which he interprets in similar terms to his own, as Christ being truly present under the form or Gestalt of the material elements: esp. 3, 18-22. 27 The Holy Eucharist a Comfort to the Penitent (Oxford, 1843), 27.</page><page sequence="11">338 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY definition, but he took the view that nothing should be done to exclude an Evangelical reading.28 So, despite his defense of some existing dogmatic conventions within the church of his time, we should not universalize this and suppose that once his early liberalism was abandoned he then simply retreated into dogmatic certainties, ever then searching for more and more precise definition. On the contrary, there is this degree of continuity between his earlier and later life, that he remained throughout of the conviction that over-definition can be destructive of meaning and life. Where he had changed was on the question of whether biblical criticism could contribute to that meaning and life, or not. Pusey would, I suspect, therefore not have been wholly surprised by the way in which so many contemporary Roman Catholic theologians have sought to give less restrictive or more open readings of traditional ecclesiastical doctrinal definitions, in the hope that they might thereby be given some new life.29 CRISES AND DISCONTINUITY Then, secondly, one notes that although his opening paragraphs in Theology of Germany begin like Newman in the Essay with a natural image, that of plant and seed,30 unlike Newman a tranquil or natural development is very much subordinated to what one might call a staccato history. So, for instance, one long sentence that begins by talking of tranquil modifications ends by speaking of a series of "crises." The relevant issue, he writes, "having reached a crisis, manifests itself more energetically in the 28 He speaks of a desire not to narrow the comprehensiveness of the Church of England by imposing a "new and more stringent statement of the doctrine of baptism:" so a letter to the Guardian of 17 June 1850, quoted by Peter Cobb in P. Butler ed. Pusey Rediscovered (London, 1983), 350. 29 As, for instance, in Bernard Lonergan's view that dogmas are intended to be heuristic devices for setting bounds to subsequent discussion rather than positive assertions of a quite specific content: Method in Theology (London, 1973), e. g. 323. 30 Theology of Germany, 2, 4.</page><page sequence="12">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 339 new development to which this crisis gives rise," while "each new period prepares for a new crisis."31 If at this stage of his thinking, he still thought of scripture as the final test for the legitimacy of any development,32 it is that rougher, more messy view of history that grounds the similarities to be observed in his later writing. In effect what happens is that the difficulty of detecting how develop- ments justifiably move from one stage to the next eventually led him to postulate authority for subsequent moves without claiming to understand quite what precipitated the move to the next stage. The "crises" that precipitate new understandings mean that history can only be understood in retrospect. He thus presupposes a more radical type of change than Newman himself allows, and this seems confirmed by some of the subsequent changes he makes in his own theological position. Initially this can most easily be observed from the nature of the response that he eventually made to his time of study in Germany. Having found historical criticism wanting, nonetheless he did not return to a literal reading of the Old Testament in all cases. Rather, taking his clue from the Fathers, for much of the Old Testament he now found its typological significance the most important, the way in which its stories and figures point to Christ. The contrast with biblical criticism is so marked that it is natural to doubt any continuity in his thought, but again there is more than first meets the eye. His interest in biblical criticism seems to have been motivated in part by his desire to found the authority of scripture on a more secure historical basis, perhaps in reaction to the scepticism of his own family, including his elder brother and future wife, Maria who found "so much of uncertainty, if not of contradiction, in scripture itself."33 His Lectures on Types and Prophecies of the Old Testament of 1836 can thus be seen as an 31 ibid., 5. 32 ibid., 8. 33 Quoted from a letter of 3 October 1827 by David Forrester in Butler ed., Pusey Rediscovered, 132.</page><page sequence="13">340 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY alternative means of making credible the Old Testament's relation to the New.34 But note in the process what has happened: he has moved closer to a "crisis" account of the relation between the Old Testament and the New, for types are only really intelligible and yield their meaning in retrospect. It is not that one can see precisely where they are pointing at the time. In other words, typology only finds retrospective justification once the type has been fulfilled, and so by implication the precise meaning and direction of revelation only becomes clear in the light of subsequent events. It is thus emphatically not the case that, had we only the Old Testament on its own, we could still easily anticipate the coming of Christ and what this might mean. Rather, it is only once Christ had come that a re-reading of the Old Testament text is then forced upon us, and its true meaning for the church at last becomes clear. This was, however, by no means the only relation he came to understand in such terms as one of "crisis" rather than continuity. If Pusey in 1828 was still giving Scripture unqualified authority with the Reformation the best guide to what the Bible had said, by the 1840s he had begun to move away even from his subsequent adoption of the patristic period for this role, with the Fathers confirming or otherwise an appropriate meaning for scripture.35 Instead, in marked contrast to earlier high church views, he now came to give this period independent authority and significance in its own right, not least because he saw it as the time of the 34 David Jasper has drawn attention to the holistic reading adopted in these unpublished lectures, and the resulting marked contrast to Liddon's own appeal to specific predictions: "Pusey's Lectures on Types and Prophecies of the Old Testament" in But- ler ed., 51-70, esp. 52 35 In 1832 he could even speak of Calvin as a "saint": so Liddon, Life of Pusey, I, 234.</page><page sequence="14">PUSE Y AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 34 1 universal church.36 In other words, he no longer felt the need to prove in each case that ideas were continuous with, or a development from, scripture. Rather, for him the patristic period should be understood to speak in its own terms as to how revelation should be understood. In effect Pusey was now requiring that we should take the history of the church with the maximum seriousness. The full implications of New Testament teaching could not simply be drawn from scripture by itself. Instead we needed to turn to the early church in order to see how its significance was worked out, and learn from the way in which the text was applied in circumstances sometimes quite as different as the New Testament world was from the Old. And now comes the rub. For, if this is the correct interpretation of where Pusey's reflections had arrived by the 1840s, then ironically it becomes much easier to render them compatible with modern biblical scholarship than is the case with Newman. Quite a high degree of discontinuity between Old and New Testament would now be widely acknowledged among biblical scholars, and much the same pertains for patristic experts with respect to the relation between the New Testament and what comes thereafter. Newman's organic metaphors seem therefore much less appropriate than Pusey's talk of "crises" and of a largely only retrospective endorsement. All this, though, may sound rather forbiddingly abstract. So let me offer a couple of examples of what I mean. To avoid detailed issues of historical scholarship, I shall use what I hope are a couple of readily accessible examples. As a biblical instance, consider the use of the Sarah/Hagar analogy in Galatians, chapter 4 (vs. 21-31). Much to the reader's 36 The contrast is well brought out in P. B. Nockles, The Oxford Movement in Context: Anglican High Churchmanship, 1760-1857 (Cambridge, 1994), 104-45, esp. 114. By 1838 his respect for the Reformers had been modified to the extent of requiring appeal to a patristic consensus as seen through their eyes, whereas by 1840 he is prepared to talk of "reference to the ancient Church, instead of the Reformers, as the ultimate expounder of the meaning of our church.": for quotation, Nockles, 127; for the development in his thinking, R.H. Greenfield, "Such a friend to the Pope" in Butler ed., Pusey Rediscovered, 162-84, esp. 163, 167, 173.</page><page sequence="15">342 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY surprise in order to make Christianity the true heir of the covenant with Abraham, Paul makes Sinai identical with the slave Hagar rather than with the natural choice of the free Sarah, and that despite the fact that the Genesis authors themselves clearly saw that earlier covenant as anticipatory of the later one with Moses at Sinai. As an analysis of the original meaning of the relevant Genesis and Exodus texts, it looks therefore as if we are left with no real alternative but to concede the utter implausibility of Paul's interpretation, and the literal reading accepted by Judaism thus becomes the most obviously legitimate heir to such passages. To talk of a natural or organic development from the earlier interpretation to Paul's would simply put too great a strain on the natural meaning of the words, and so any Newman type argument in defense of Paul is thus in real trouble. By contrast Pusey's retrospective typological approach does allow the possibility of a more complex connection. It is only in the light of Christ that the Genesis passage can now be re-read and given an appropriate new meaning.37 Again, if we turn now to the patristic period, think of the question of the threefold ministry. Some continue to argue that it is already there in scripture, but they would find few biblical scholars to support them. Notions of "bishop" and "presbyter" and "deacon" are still remarkably fluid. Yet why should that be the end of the argument? Might not the "crisis" of the patristic period generate the need for new expressions of ministry such that, while not exactly continuous with the biblical dispensation, they might still be defended as the best way of organizing church order in the quite different circumstances that had by then emerged? After all, it is surely scarcely surprising that different patterns would be required in the startlingly different contexts of, 37 There is a similar issue about how Matthew's use of Old Testament prophecy can best be defended; for one possible response, see my The Word To Set You Free (London, 1995), 17-21.

If it is objected that this is simply an argument from pragmatism, the answer is that it is not. Both courses of action can be seen as motivated by the desire to maintain the unity of Christ's church, and thus both equally as being part of the divine dispensation. The temptation has always been to want everything to be in some sense explicit in the New Testament, whereas it may not even be there implicitly, as Newman had claimed.38 The notion of "crisis" can allow for that possibility and so for a more radical understanding of change than that: principles that only become clear once the church has been forced into new directions. None of this of course is to say that Pusey would have approved of my second example. In his own day the discontinuities looked less obvious. But I think the example a good one to take precisely because, while my first biblical example is one Pusey would happily have endorsed, the second indicates how his position might be further elaborated, in order to face fresh contemporary challenges to Christian self-understanding. The Protestant mistake is to suppose that the biblical world can immediately be transposed into our own. It cannot. Pusey rightly saw that we needed clues from a world more like our own, and this is what he uses the patristic period to provide, and we today can use the history of the church in a similar way. Newman once claimed that he was prepared to "go the whole hog with Darwin,"39 but there is little sense of the messiness of evolution in his approach, whereas Pusey's "crises" and discontinuities in fact take us much 38 Note his extraordinary claim in a letter to John Stanislas Flanagan that "there is nothing which the Church has defined or shall define but what an Apostle, if asked, would have been able fully to answer and would have answered": J. D. Holmes ed., The Theological Papers of John Henry Newman on Biblical Inspiration and Infallibility (Oxford, 1979), 151-60, esp. 158. 39 9 December 1863: For the quotation in context, see my Newman: A Man for Our Time (London, 1990), 5.</page><page sequence="17">344 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY nearer.40 If a cautious conservatism prevented him from exploring too deeply why precisely change occurred along with these new "crises," at least he provides us with a framework for exploring the significance of such discontinuities, whether they be within Scripture itself or beyond. THE FUTURE AND UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES Where, however, Newman might be thought indisputably to have the edge in our comparison between the two leaders is on the question of the future direction of the church. For, given Pusey's apparently invariable practice of searching for past precedent, it looks as though nothing really novel or innovative could ever be allowed. Indeed, as we noted earlier, Pusey's life seems sometimes to read more like a litany of lost causes. One need only think, for instance, of the way in which despite Pusey's opposition the required recitation of the Athanasian Creed went, or how the rejection of hell as a place of eternal punishment has even been enshrined in a recent report of the Doctrine Commission of the Church of England, subsequently endorsed by General Synod.41 The latter change of attitude had been occurring within the Anglican communion over the course of the past century and more, whereas another controversial example, the ordination of women, is of much more recent vintage. Pusey would clearly have taken the conservative position in both cases. Even so what is worth asking is whether there is any inkling in his writings of how he might have handled the possibility of future change of this kind, namely that which lacked virtually all patristic precedent.42 40 And that despite Pusey's own suspicions of evolution: e.g. Liddon, Life of Pusey , IV, 336. 41 Mystery of Salvation (London, 1995), 199: "hell is not eternal torment, but... total non-being." 42 Origen and Gregory of Nyssa are the only two church fathers to question the eternity of hell, and thereafter we must await until the nineteenth century before doubts become common.</page><page sequence="18">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 345 In a moment I shall turn to a more striking example from the beginning of his career, but consider first his attitude to ritualism. For initial indifference did gradually give way to support for various innovations, and it is fascinating to consider why this was so. I have already mentioned his conservatism in the interior planning of St. Saviour's, Leeds. Even so, that went with the endorsement of Gothic in his choice of architectural style and the inclusion of symbolism in the designs for its windows of a kind that like Gothic very much reflected the middle ages rather than the patristic period.43 In that choice he was of course aided by the fact that despite his conversion to Rome Pugin' s endorsement of Gothic was largely viewed with indifference by his adopted community, whereas, thanks to Ruskin's portrayal of the classical as the characteristically degenerate Roman Catholic style, Gothic eventually came to be seen as the norm even for non- conformist chapels.44 By contrast, much "advanced" Anglican ritual amounted to little more than the mere aping of Roman practice. Yet, it can by no means all be described in this way, and what is particularly fascinating to observe is the way in which Pusey's own defenses of innovation came increasingly to be guided not so much by appeal to Rome as by underlying principles, such as what would most enhance a doctrine of real presence.45 It is only in this way, for example, that we can explain his greater readiness to accept eastward-facing celebrations as against vestments. He thought the latter ran the risk of doing greater honour to the priest than to what he celebrated. All this may seem far removed from 1828, but one notes in Theology of Germany a similar appeal to underlying principles. 43 The architect, J. M. Derick, had been a pupil of the neo-classical architect, Sir John Soane, but in this instance the influence of Pugin is clear. The West window to designs of Pugin originally had angels catching Christ's blood in chalices as it fell from the cross. 44 In comprehending Roman Catholic attitudes one need only recall that St. Peter's was in the Renaissance and not Gothic style. Ruskin makes his anti-Roman comments in his Stones of Venice. 45 J. S. Reed, Glorious Battle: The Cultural Politics of Anglo-Catholicism (London, 1998), 20-21.</page><page sequence="19">346 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY Indeed, it is only in this way that one can understand why he was so favourably disposed to biblical criticism in the first place. While he readily concedes that biblical criticism could be purely rationalistic, he notes in its defense "the more favourable direction which science has taken... the disposition has ceased to ascribe reality only to that which admits of demonstration... the claims of feeling, the peculiar organ of religion in man, remain no longer unregarded."46 In comments like these the influence of Schleiermacher is obvious, and, just as obvious, Pusey's support for him did not last. The danger, though, is that we misread the reasons both for that original enthusiasm and for Pusey's subsequent change of mind. Undergirding both initial interest and final rejection was in fact a consistent set of religious principles. Thus what initially inspired him appears to have been the thought that biblical criticism might help in the task of distinguishing "the essential" from "the non-essential and accidental" and thus "the crisis shall slowly unfold itself, and the religious life... gradually recover a sound and healthy state."47 That is to say, his hope was that biblical criticism by paying closer attention to historical context and developments of thought might free up the text to exhibit more clearly its truly spiritual dimensions. It was likewise because he felt that that his hopes could not after all be realised in this way that biblical criticism was abandoned. I take it therefore, had he encountered in England more people like his friends in Germany prepared to take a non- reductionist approach to biblical criticism he might well have persevered, but perhaps he encountered too many like Blanco White to give him any confidence about its future.48 My two examples are quite different, but they do, I think, illustrate a mind prepared to contemplate new kinds of consider- ation throughout his life, both as young "liberal" and as old 46 Theology of Germany , I, 183. 47 Ibid., 185. 48 White had begun as a Roman Catholic priest, but eventually passed through Anglicanism into Unitarianism.</page><page sequence="20">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 347 "conservative" (even if the questions for him late in life were not always his own but forced on him by his leading role in the Church Union).49 It would thus be quite wrong to think of Pusey totally tied to past precedents. He was prepared to see new initia- tives, and indeed in a letter to Manning we actually find him affirming that "a particular Church had a right to reform itself."50 In saying this I do not of course intend to transform Pusey into what he was not - a radical. Even so, the way in which he contemplated future change does seem once more to offer better prospects than Newman's apparently more securely based theory. To see why, it is worth reflecting for a moment on what has happened within the Roman Catholic Church in the intervening century or so. From a nineteenth-century perspective, it would have seemed reasonable to expect that by now papal infallibility would have been widely exercised and, perhaps most obviously, Mary declared co-redemptrix along with Christ. But this is not in fact what has occurred. On the contrary, Vatican II turned the church in a more conciliar direction, while Mary, so far from being further exalted, was actually included in the Constitution on the Church as a fellow-believer, even if admittedly this was by a very narrow margin of seventeen votes. The point, though, that I want to make is that the changes were effected, as records of the discussion at the council indicate, by appeal to underlying principles. Newman's image of development would most naturally have suggested a rather different pattern, the one I indicated above, with a more obvious building upon the assumptions of Vatican I. Some defense of Newman is of course possible, were one to explore the twentieth-century developments against a wider backdrop of the long history of the church,51 and 49 He joined in 1866, but we have to wait until 1881, the year before his death, for a strong defense of ritualism as a legitimate development of Tractarianism. 50 Letter to H. E. Manning, 12 August 1845. 51 Alternatively, one could argue that Newman's more limited understanding of infallibility was fulfilled by Vatican II; so e. g. J. Coulson, Religion and Imagination (Oxford, 1981), 80-81.</page><page sequence="21">348 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY my intention is not of course to imply that Pusey did in any sense exercise such influence. My point is simply that it is far from as clear as is commonly claimed that the spirit of the council was in fact the spirit of Newman. That question aside, in considering how the church is to proceed in the future, it does seems to me that Pusey for all his intense conservatism has the edge, in advocating that the only adequate response is at times a return to basic principles. Twice in his lifetime Pusey did just that, and if initially it seems strange to link his early support for biblical criticism and his late endorsement of ritualism, yet both were underpinned by the same religious motivation, the attempt to found more adequately in personal experience his vision of God's continuing engagement with our world. In the one case he was pushed towards a more dynamic reading of scripture, in the other towards a more dramatic performance of the liturgy. CONCLUSION Appearances notwithstanding then, there is after all much more continuity to Pusey's thought than is commonly supposed. Not only that, despite all his caution and conservatism and his frequent changes of mind, there are at least these three elements to his thought that could still offer to today's church a more helpful approach to contemporary doctrinal issues than Newman's initially more appealing and persuasive theory. Indeed, perhaps it was that very caution that has helped Pusey become more relevant in this way to our own day. Newman was just too much the optimist, too much the Romantic, altogether too typical of his age. However apparently remote, Pusey's stern face and asceticism actually better anticipated the complexities of our current dilemmas. Let me end, though, by paying one last visit to St. Saviour's in Leeds. Some of the early clergy who left for Rome in 1851 helped found the local Catholic parish, a church eventually built in 1857</page><page sequence="22">PUSEY AS CONSISTENT AND WISE 349 under the patronage of the French religious Order of Mary Immaculate.52 When that order withdrew its support for the parish in 1991, the local diocese decided to close the church, and so, by one of those splendid ironies that only history can throw up, the local Roman Catholic congregation now worships each Sunday in St. Saviour's building. Newman had used the earlier move in 1851 to speak of the inevitability of Roman success. His confidence, however, on that occasion as with his theory of devel- opment, still assumes too smooth a course for Christ's Church. One generation's "unthinkable" becomes another's reality. Pusey's caution and fear of change may have led him to support causes which few, if any, today would any longer espouse. Even so, all in the contemporary Church could still build on his recog- nition of "crises" (with their resultant discontinuities) and the lessons he saw in them. They constitute both a warning against too much definition in doctrine and a summons to periodic renewal through a return to the fundamental, underlying principles of the Christian faith. David Brown is Van Mildert Professor of Divinity, University of Durham, Durham, England. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy earlier this year. 52 An account of the early life of St. Saviour's is provided by John Pollen in his Narrative and also in the biography of him by his daughter, Anne: John Hungerford Pollen, 1820-1902 (London, 1912). Although Anne Pollen is contemptuous in her attitudes to Anglican and Methodist practice (e.g. 58, 156), in fact in 1851 only eleven laity went over to Rome with the clergy (214).</page></plain_text>
