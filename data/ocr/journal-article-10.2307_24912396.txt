<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scientists, Citizens, and Statesmen: U.S.-Canadian Wildlife Protection Treaties in the Progressive Era Since the first Earth Day in 1970, diplomatic initiatives to confront environ mental crises have become quite popular. Debt-for-nature swaps, control of chlorofluorocarbons, elimination of trade in endangered species, and earth summits are now accepted habitat for diplomats.1 Not unreasonably, many people assume that this flurry of activity is the first of its kind, a sudden recognition of the fragility of the planet and all of its species. In fact, the conservationists ot tne progressive era were tne true pioneers in cratting a diplomacy of natural resource protection. Like their modern counterparts, early-twentieth-century conservationists needed to find creative solutions to problems unthought of in previous generations. Those who pushed for international agreements to guard natural re sources understood that environmental problems did not confine themselves to political boundaries. Progressive era conservationists recognized that state, provincial, and national governments were often unable and unwilling to undertake necessary protective action. In proposing a North American conference on conservation, President Theodore Roosevelt asserted that "it is evident that natural resources are not limited by the boundary lines which separate nations, and that the need for conserving them upon this continent is as wide as the area upon which they exist."2 Although Roosevelt's confer * I would like to thank Professors Gaddis Smith and William Cronon for their assistance with this article. 1.

Spurred on by the continuing assault on nature and a growing faith in the power of applied science, the United States and Canada blazed a new trail by concluding three treaties that prioritized the goals of the conservation movement: the Inland Fisheries Treaty of 1908, the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, and the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916.3 Although supporters conceived of and executed them independently, the agreements shared important similarities. Each dealt with commercially valuable verte brates that migrated across international boundaries. Overharvesting ot the animals in question threatened imminent extinction, which in turn would have led to irreparable economic and environmental damage. Finally, the two sides allowed scientists and conservationists to influence the course of diplomacy in the hope of finding a cooperative solution. The success or failure of each of these treaties depended on how well scientists and conser vationists sold their vision of international cooperation to reluctant diplo mats and legislators. None of these treaties has been especially well covered in the literature on the Progressive era. Most American diplomatic historians have been aware of the Anglo-American confrontation in the Bering Sea, if only be cause of Samuel Flagg Bemis's pithy summary of the fur seal's existence: "Amphibious is the fur seal, ubiquitous and carnivorous, uniparous, gregari ous and withal polygamous." But the standard accounts categorize the seal ing dispute as a minor, if unusual, obstacle along the path of Anglo American rapprochement.* The migratory bird and inland fisheries treaties have suffered in anonymity from a lack of controversy. On the surface, they appear to be just two more examples of the seemingly eternal peaceful relations between the United States and Canada. These three agreements stand together because of the role of concerned private citizens who wanted to use diplomacy to prevent the extinction of valuable and beautiful wildlife. It was a time when applied science seemed to hold the answers for many problems, and with each of these treaties of Canada, Ottawa, Canada. Roosevelt, like many conservationists of his era, thought of wild animals as a resource to be managed like forests or minerals. 3. Caldwell gives a brief summary of the negotiations over three decades that culminated in 1902 in a European agreement to protect migratory birds (International Environmental Policy, 28). Conservationists in England and the United States felt that the treaty was a poor model because of its limited focus and lack of enforcement. 4.

The conservation movement, enjoying the peak of its power at the end of the Roosevelt administration, also had the ability to sway the course of diplo macy. Because of the special nature of the resources involved, diplomats often found themselves relying on and receiving pressure from citizens who usually had no say in the making of foreign policy. In a sense, the most important negotiations for each of these treaties were not between American and British diplomats but between statesmen and citizens in each country. The central goal of each treaty was the protection of a "common prop erty" resource-that is, something no one owns but many use. A common property resource can be anything from air to blue whales. Such a resource lends itself to "the fisherman's problem." Rational fishermen will catch as many fish as they can, because any fish left in the water will be captured by someone else. They cannot afford to leave fish behind to replenish the resource. As historian Arthur McEvoy wrote, "In a competitive economy, nu iiiarKCL iiieciiaiiisiii uiuniaiiiy cxibib lu icwaiu iiiuiviuuai luiucaiaucc m the use of shared resources." Only cooperative regulations, which biologist Garrett Hardin called "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon," can safe guard common property resource.' Because the species in question in each of the treaties crossed international boundaries, the governments of Canada and the United States had three options to address the problem. First, they could allow the status quo to continue, with the risk that the species would be driven to extinction. Sec ond, they could attempt to undertake unilateral protective action, with the hope that the other nation would follow suit. Third, they could cooperatively regulate resource use so that all parties faced common restrictions. The third option was preferable and the hardest to attain. Cooperation of this sort required trust, a rare commodity in international relations. At the same time, those same economic actors who were destroying the resources fought co operative regulations because of the obvious threat to their livelihoods. Because the birds, seals, and fish were beyond the control of any one government, their decline forced the search for solutions into the realm of diplomacy. In each of the treaty cases, the animals' distribution was so great that states or provinces could not provide the necessary protection. Unilat eral action was possible, but, as the fisherman's problem demonstrated, there was no reward for such forbearance unless all resource users partici pated equally. Even if Canada and the United States managed indepen dently to reach similar conclusions about the need for conservation of a particular resource, the chance that their laws would complement one an other was slim. The diplomatic route was not, however, without its own perils. By their 5- Arthur McEvoy, The Fisherman's Problem: Ecology and Law in the California Fisheries, i8$o 1980 (Cambridge, England, 1986), 9-10; Garrett Hardin, "The Tragedy of the Commons," Science, 13 December 1968, 1243-48.</page><page sequence="4">4IO : DIPLOMATIC HISTORY nature, diplomats were suspicious of cooperative international efforts be cause they required the nation to forgo obvious short-term benefits for uncertain long-term returns. And that risk in turn might well benefit the other parties to the agreement. American diplomats were happy to settle resource questions with their Canadian neighbors, so long as the terms favored the United States. In addition, more traditional interest groups, such as fishermen or states'-rights proponents, feared the impact of the conservation treaties. Whether facing economic dislocation or a threat to their view of the Constitution, these citizens presented a powerful challenge to those pushing for international cooperation to protect common property resources. In response to the economically driven race to strip the continent, conser vationists sought to modify market forces in an effort to protect shared resources. Historian Samuel Hays described the conservationist creed: "Since resource matters were basically technical in nature, . . . technicians, rather than legislators, should deal with them."6 With their technical exper tise, these scientists could promote the efficiency that would allow the continued expansion of economic opportunity. Facing similar, if less in tense, problems, many Canadians also gravitated toward the conservationist ethic of reducing the waste of shared resources. This common political and sorial Hpvplnnmpnr allowed Americans and Canadians to eoonerate in solv ing their common property disputes. There were two distinct trends in the conservation movement, preserva tionism and utilitarianism. Preservationists focused on the need to protect natural beauty where it still withstood the onslaught of economic growth. Hard science, such as forestry or hydrology, formed the basis of utilitarian ism, and its adherents sought the efficient use of natural resources. In most cases, trained scientists took a utilitarian approach to their subjects, eschew ing the sentimentality so important to the preservationist movement. Utili tarians tended to have more political influence in the White House because they were often government employees. When mobilized, however, the more numerous preservationists could bring enormous political pressure to bear on Congress and the president.' In order to win approval for the resource protection treaties, scientists and conservationists had to accomplish three goals: first, they had to sur mount the diplomats' inclination to worry about national sovereignty; sec 6.

Fundamentally, scien tists and conservationists had to prove that international control of common property was better for the national interest than unfettered rivalry. In the case of the inland fisheries, American scientists failed to rally much sup port, and the treaty died. With the seals, a successful, but limited, treaty came about only after both governments yielded to scientific evidence that their stubbornness was destroying the species. Finally, the Migratory Bird Treaty brought together scientists, conservationists, diplomats, and legisla tors in a concerted effort to save the beloved and valuable birds of the continent. The ill-fated Inland Fisheries Treaty began as an effort to clean up issues left over from the collapse of the Joint High Commission in 1899. On 15 March 1906, Secretary of State Elihu Root proposed to the British ambassador, Sir Mortimer Durand, that it was time to resolve all dis agreements between the United States and Canada. In particular, Root singled out the chaotic situation surrounding the commercial fisheries along the border, especially the Great Lakes and Puget Sound. The fisheries yields were declining, and tensions were rising, despite a joint Canadian-American scientific study finished in 1896 that called for strict regulations. The boundary-water fishing dispute was shaping up as just one more chapter in the long history of disastrous U.S.-Canadian competi tion for fish.8 The fundamental problem was a lack of unity in fishery regulations along the border. For instance, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario all tried to regulate fishing in Lake Erie. On the West Coast, British Columbia and Washington took drastically different approaches toward con trolling the salmon fishery of Puget Sound. The fishermen of each locality had their own particular types of nets and boats, and local governments responded to local fishermen's political power by outlawing the methods of 8.

Doc. 315. Negotiators discussed this report at the JHC, but the Alaska boundary dispute prevented an agreement. A good account of this first effort to regulate the fisheries is Margaret Beattie Bogue's "To Save the Fish: Canada, the United States, the Great Lakes, and the Joint Commission of 1892 "Journal of American History 79 (March 1993): 1429-54. The most discussed issue has been that of fishing rights off Newfoundland and adjacent land masses.

Competition among fishermen made cooperation among the several states and provinces impossible. Root hoped that a treaty could bring some order to this vital industry while eliminating a source of Anglo-American tension.9 The Canadian government supported Root's initiative to solve this old problem. Many Canadians believed that Americans were too cavalier in their use and abuse of natural resources. Canadian fishermen operated under more stringent restrictions than their American counterparts, providing a lesson in the workings of the fisherman's problem. State governments did not try to match Canadian restraint; rather, they allowed their fishermen to take the extra fish that the Canadians left behind. One fisherman from British Colum bia summed up the Canadian anger: "Your Honourable Government has placed and enforced most stringent regulations upon her subjects; BUT WHAT RECIPROCAL REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY THE UNITED STATES?"10 The negotations and content of the treaty were fairly routine. Both sides agreed that professional diplomats were incapable of drawing up compre hensive fishery regulations. Therefore, the treaty established a two-member commission to investigate the boundary waters and submit regulations for legislative approval. The only source of controversy was the definition of the boundarv waters. As Root told Ambassador Sir lames Brvce, "The con trolling idea of the treaty is that separate regulations of the different parts of the same body of water must necessarily be ineffective." The two sides often disagreed, however, on whether the different parts of the Great Lakes constituted the same body of water. After months of debating the status of Lake Michigan, Georgian Bay, and some smaller areas, the negotiators agreed to include only those bodies that straddled the border, from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Passamaquoddy Bay." On 4 April 1908, Root and Bryce signed the agreement. ç.

Unfortunately, there is not a similar mono graph for the Puget Sound fisheries. In his biography of Root, Richard Leopold emphasizes that Root's diplomacy was based upon a desire to keep the nation out of trouble by eliminating possible crises (Elihu Root and the Conservative Tradition [Boston, 1954], 50). In their survey of U.S.-Canadian relations, Jack Granatstein and Norman Hillmer described Root's first look at U.S.-Canadian relations: "Root abhorred disorder, and disorder was everywhere" (For Better or For Worse: Canada and the United States to the 1990s [Toronto, 1991], 38). 10.

Jordan was well known as a scientist, social critic, and general Renaissance man. He considered himself to be a naturalist and pacifist, as well as a "minor prophet of democracy." In making their recommendation, government fisheries officials wrote that "Dr. Jordan is more familiar than anyone else in this country with the natural history and economic questions involved." For his part, Jordan "accepted the position as a matter of pleasure and honor, and also as a matter of duty."12 Because of his standing as a scientist and advocate of social justice, Jordan was committed to formulating a fair and sustainable system of fishing regulations. In contrast to the American appointment, the Dominion Government made the uninspired choice of Samuel Bastedo, a Liberal party hack who had recently lost his appointment as an Ontario fisheries authority because of campaign improprieties. The two men traveled together in the summer o - „r -1 i - i a a A v.. tyvv ~ ...v.-,. v.. w vvivv, ...v.«.. — .v. vwyvi ... „...., ...&amp; the first set of proposals. Unfortunately, Bastedo cared little for fisheries regulations, and by the end of the year he had jumped ship to head the Canadian government pension board. His successor, Professor E. E. Prince, was in fact a trained ichthyologist. But the time necessary for him to catch up with Jordan's work, his admitted bouts with depression, and his habit ual procrastination damaged the IPC's credibility and delayed the whole process.'3 Prince and Jordan concluded that the inland fisheries could no longer sustain the massive effort made by fishermen on both sides of the border. Catches of commercially valuable species were declining, and pollution and habitat loss were taking an ever larger toll. Prince thought that Canadians were generally at fault, but Jordan disagreed. "The fisheries of Puget Sound have been utterly wrecked by overfishing," he wrote. "For this Canadians have been to some degree responsible, the Americans very much more." The two men agreed that "there can be no resuscitation . . . unless we cut out about half the fishing" and controlled some of the damage to the environ ment With those ends in mind the IFC drew un sivtv-siv rules for fishina in the boundary waters, ranging from limits on mesh size of nets to strict pollution controls. The scientists hoped to strike a balance between neces sary safeguards against overfishing and the desire of small fishermen to stay in business. Jordan argued that "the regulations are well-considered, fairly 12.

To conserve the fisheries means that somebody must catch fewer fish."1'» As the IFC's rules became more thorough, the State Department began to worry. Jordan and Counsellor Chandler Anderson often wrestled over the scientist's responsibilities. After nine months on the IFC, Jordan still did not know whether his job was "to remedy the most serious evils, without pretense to covering all the ground," or "to prepare a general, broad uni form code to touch all fishery interests." Jordan found his answer when he observed that "the present State Department wishes us to dodge responsibil ity whenever possible."1' In contrast, Anderson thought that Jordan was unrealistic in his goals, especially his desire to establish a licensing system to fund an international warden patrol for the treaty waters. A system of licenses was crucial to Jordan's plan, not only for monetary reasons but also to control access to the fisheries. But the concept of such control over a free resource was too radical for Anderson and cost Jordan the active support of ine oiaie meparimeni. apparently, /vinencan uipiomais nau nupeu 10 re solve the diplomatic impasse without actually addressing the decline of the fisheries. When Jordan and Prince completed their efforts, they still had to worry about congressional reaction. Under the terms of the treaty, the IFC submit ted its proposals to Congress and the Canadian Parliament for approval. Parliament quickly took the requisite action to make the proposals into law. Both sides believed that Congress would also accept the Jordan-Prince pro posals.'6 The Senate had ratified the treaty easily in 1908, the regulations seemed fair and necessary, and the scientists had tried to ameliorate the concerns of fishermen all along the border. Publication of the proposed regulations created a wave of protest from fishing communities, especially on the American side of the border. Law yers for canners' and fishermen's associations wrote to Congress and Presi dent Taft arguing that the treaty was unconstitutional because it infringed upon states' rights. Others argued that the strict new regulations would drive them and hundreds of colleagues out of business. More restrained opponents pointed out that certain regulations were redundant in their effect and caused unnecessary hardship for fishermen. Very few acknowl edged that they would all be out of business without some sort of externally imposed international cooperation. 14.

After sending the regulations to Congress on 2 February 1910, the administration did nothing for one year. On 15 April 1911, when the regulations were hung up in committee and in need of help, Knox fired Jordan-the sole articulate, persuasive supporter of the treaty. As a replacement, he appointed Republi can politician Job Hedges, whom Jordan described as "an excellent citizen and a charming after-dinner speaker [who] knows nothing whatever about the Fisheries."'8 With the administration struggling, neither Taft nor Knox was willing to fight for a treaty without public support. Despite Jordan s ettorts, the conservation movement tailed to see the im portance of the boundary water fisheries. Although few people advocated depletion of commercial fisheries, most people could not get enthusiastic about whitefish. Most utilitarians had neither the scientific training nor the interest to fight for the fisheries; and most preservationists did not place fish very high on the list of beautiful things in need of protection. The only flickers of organized support came in 1914 from conservationists who were mainly concerned about the impact of a failed fisheries treaty on the impend ing migratory bird treaty negotiations. '9 Without backing from the organized conservation movement, Jordan had no hope of rallying public support. With lukewarm administration support, unhappy fishermen, and unin terested conservationists, the Prince-Jordan regulations stood no chance in Congress. Led by Senator William A. Smith (R-MI), an influential member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Congress removed the eleven most important regulations each time it received the proposals. For congressmen from nonborder states, the opposition of senators from fishery states was reason enough to oppose the bill. Regarding one proposed change to Jor dan's proposals, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (R-MA) said, "I think it ought to be made as a matter of good faith to the senior Senator of Michigan. "20 The Canadian government eventually tired of waiting for Congress to pass the regulations intact. After giving Woodrow Wilson's administration one last opportunity to ram the IFC proposals through Congress in March 1914-&gt; Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden rescinded the Canadian version of the regulations. In a tersely worded note, the Canadian government de clared its intention to resume its "liberty of action" and placed the blame for subsequent damage to the boundary fisheries squarely on the United States.21 The treaty was dead, and with it the last hope to promote rational, cooperative management of most of the great boundary water fisheries. 18.

The Great Lakes fisheries, in particular, continued their decline, as the valuable food fish lost ground to lampreys and alewives. As the food fish populations faded away, the loss of jobs was worse than it would have been under the proposed IFC regulations. Equally important, Congress's shabby handling of the Prince-Jordan regulations caused Canadians to question American sincerity on conservation issues. Canadian conservationists feared that if the United States could not live up to an agreement that Root had instigated, then Canadians could never hope to initiate a successful treaty. The fisheries treaty died because Jordan and his allies failed to convince many people that fish mattered enough to surrender the American right to neglect fishery regulations. A few government scientists supported the regu lations, but conservationists did not heed their advice. Jordan could not convert his scientific knowledge into public support. And without that support, the Taft administration and Congress refused to risk American jobs—especially theirs-for the possibility that some species of fish might be in decline. Unfortunately, most people who cared about the boundary water fisheries were those who thought that the fisherman's problem was too much regulation. In contrast to the apathy about the fisheries, the plight of the Bering Sea fur seals drew substantial public and diplomatic attention. Known to its scientist friends as Callorhinus ursinus, the northern fur seal is truly an international species. Fur seals form separate rookeries on the Pribilof Is lands (United States), the Kuriles (Japan), and the Commander Islands (Russia), where they spend the summer and rear their young. Including the long feeding trips they take from their rookeries and the eight-month open ocean migration the herds make between breeding seasons, seals spend more than 75 percent of their time in international waters." With breeding herds visiting Japanese, Russian, and American territory, and with the market for the valuable and fashionable skins based in London, no single country could hope to control the harvest of seals. Because they did not reside in any one government's jurisdiction, the seals were obvious candi dates for international control. Fur seals became a diplomatic issue only after Canadians took up the practice of pelagic sealing in the 1880s. Clearing the port of Victoria every spring, Canadians headed out for the Bering Sea to catch seals on the ocean deep. Pelagic sealers used rifles and clubs to kill the animals, often as they lay sleeping on the surface of the water, and they could not discriminate between males and females. Anywhere from 50 to 80 percent of the seals killed at sea sank before they could be recovered. Despite harsh conditions on the seas and the enormous wastage of skins, Canadians found pelagic 22.

Jordan's four volume report was the result of the first comprehensive scientific study of fur seal biology.</page><page sequence="11">Scientists, Citizens, and Statesmen : 417 sealing to be very profitable. When foreigners had completed the destruc tion of the Kurile Islands herd in the early 1890s, the Japanese government began to subsidize its sealing vessels. As owners of islands with large herds, and thus with access to terrestrial sealing, Russia and the United States outlawed pelagic sealing. On the Pribilof Islands, the right to kill seals belonged entirely to a company that held a lease from the U.S. government. The North American Commercial Company won a twenty-year lease in 1890 after some shady dealings with Benjamin Harrison's administration. Under the terms of the agreement, the government set the rate at which the company could harvest young male seals. Over the period of the lease, the government trimmed the quota of sealskins from one hundred thousand to fifteen thousand, but the NACC rarely could reach its limit.24 For twenty-five years, the American government faced constant pressure to end foreign pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. The government's first response to pelagic sealing was concern that Canadians were taking Ameri can property. Although American diplomats never completely let go of this tenet, by the 1890s there were nobler reasons to oppose pelagic sealing. As scientists learned more about the fur seal, they encouraged the government to protect the species as a unique natural history asset that produced very valuable fur. The seals' physical attributes-soft fur, big eyes, and grace of movement-made them a public relations hit. Very few people had ever seen a fur seal, but newspaper stories, children's books, and a blatantly anthropomorphic public relations campaign made fur seal conservation an important cause in the United States.2' The decline of the seal population astounded government scientists. In the early 1870s, the Pribilof herd had about 2,500,000 individuals. The first scientific surveys in the late 1890s suggested that the population had dwin dled to approximately 400,000. By 1910, when Anglo-American negotia tions began in earnest, U.S. scientists knew there were fewer than 150,000 seals left on the Pribilofs. In the words of Secretary of Commerce and Labor Charles Nagel, "when we are told that in about 12 years the breeding 23.

All participants quickly recognized that there was too much killing, but no one was willing to accept the blame. Canadian sealers and scientists argued that American land-killing was destroying the Pribilof herd. American diplomats and scientists, led again by David Starr Jordan, blamed the decline on the loss of breeding females to the pelagic sealers. In 1892 a joint U.S.-Canadian commission broke up when the Canadians ar gued that the evidence was inconclusive. In 1897 a similar attempt to reach a scientific conclusion featured a scuffle between two of the scientists.2? Then, in an effort to gain diplomatic advantage, the Canadians withheld their report until they had a chance to review Jordan's findings. There seemed to be little ground for compromise. For almost twenty years, American diplomats had consulted with seien tists in an attempt to improve the strength ot their bargaining position. In 1890 the United States and Great Britain reached a modus vivendi to cease commercial sealing for one year while scientists from Canada and the United States studied the reason for the decline. The inability of that committee to agree on a root cause led to the Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893, which satisfied neither side. In 1896 the United States persuaded Canada to join the aforementioned scientific commission that ended in fisticuffs. In 1905 Secretary of State John Hay proposed revisions of the arbitration rules based on the reports of American scientists, but he died before Ottawa could decide on a course of action. Finally, as one of his last acts as secretary, Elihu Root forced the issue back on the diplomatic agenda. Citing evidence that Jordan and his colleagues had accumulated, Root called on all four sealing nations to halt pelagic sealing.28 These American scientists urged the government to settle the crisis by offering Canadian sealers compensation for ending pelagic sealing. Previ ously, the official stance in Washington had been that the country that owned the breeding sites owned the animals wherever they strayed, a dan gerous precedent to set with highly mobile common property.

As the seal herd declined and tension increased, American diplomats agreed to pursue this option, and eventually this American concession to the reality of shared resource use laid the groundwork for an equitable solution. The problem with limiting the proposal to Canadian sealers was that pelagic sealing was a dying industry in British Columbia but a thriving one in Japan. The Canadian sealing fleet, which had peaked at about sixty-five vessels, consisted of a mere four in 1909. The 1893 Bering Sea tribunal had established a restricted area around the Pribilof Islands as well as a closed season on hunting seals during the summer, both of which cut into the sealers' profit margins. Meanwhile, the Japanese were not subject to those restrictions. Aided by government subsidies, they filled the void left by Canadian sealers. By 1910 there were fifty-one Japanese sealing vessels throughout the North Pacific. Still, Secretary Nagel believed that Japan and Canada would agree to outlaw pelagic sealing. In his opinion, "pelagic sealing seems to benefit no one whom any authority is seriously interested to protect, and at the same time furnishes frequent cause for unfortunate misunderstanding and friction."29 The focus of the negotiations was the proposal by various American scientists and Canadian sealers that the rookery-owning powers should buy out the pelagic sealers. In an Anglo-American treaty signed in February 1911 the United States agreed to surrender 20 percent of the skins taken on the Pribilofs-as well as to loan Canada $200,000 to give to the sealers-in exchange for an end to pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. The deal was contingent upon the successful negotiation of a four-power pact including Japan and Russia that would eliminate pelagic sealing north of the 35th parallel. Secretary Nagel and British Ambassador Bryce believed that the first treaty gave Canada the status of a rookery-owning power, making the Dominion a partner with the United States in the upcoming negotiations. 3° When the four-power negotiations opened in Washington on 22 May 1911, both Bryce and Nagel were in for a surprise. The Canadian undersec retary of state for external affairs, Sir Joseph Pope, decided that Canada deserved compensation from both Russia and Japan in exchange for ceasing pelagic sealing off the coast of Asia. In "refusing assent to the fantastic interpretation of our recent treaty," Pope argued that Canada had a natural right to catch seals on the high seas-even if "an improvident and wasteful one," which it could only surrender in return for compensation.3' Likewise, 2ç.

In demanding over half of the American herd, the Canadi ans and the Japanese threatened to end the conference in the first week. Despite the displays of shock from Bryce, Nagel, and the Russian dele gates, the Japanese and Canadian demands were reasonable positions from which to negotiate the division of a common property resource. The Ameri cans entered the negotiations hoping to retain 80 percent of the Pribilof herd while granting nothing to Japan, the most active pelagic sealing country in the world. Common sense suggested that if the seals belonged to all who hunted them, Japan deserved a larger share than Canada. Nagel and Bryce tried to o u., — ,1.., »u« ru 11 111 I IV. 111V.

Pope and his Japanese colleagues, however, saw the 20 percent as recognition that rights to the herd depended not so much on ownership of the rookery islands as on a history of use of the resource. With the conference on the verge of collapse and their central premise discredited, American diplomats scrambled to find their footing. First they regressed to the barbaric threat to reduce the herd to ten thousand individu als in order to drive the pelagic sealers out of business. Canadian officials refused to bend, correctly calculating that American public opinion and scientific leadership would prevent such action. With that bluff called, the Americans progressed to the argument that the seals deserved protection even if it required sacrifice from some countries. In other words, if the negotiations failed, the entire world would blame Canada. Pope countered that public opinion would actually blame the United States for failing to deal fairly with Japan. Next, the Americans tried to divide the percentage of skins in creative ways, but the Japanese stuck to their demands. With nerves frayed by the one-hundred-degree heat and no solution in sight, the confer ees were prepared to go home. Urged on by Secretary Nagel, President Taft used the power of public opinion to salvage the treaty. In a personal telegram to the Japanese em peror, the president emphasized the shared desire of both countries to con serve the fur seal. He then called upon Japan to accept the latest American proposal as the fairest solution to the crisis and the last opportunity to save the species. If the negotiations collapsed, he warned that "owing to the deep interest taken by the people of the United States in this question, such failure would have a most unfavorable effect both upon official and public opinion here."'2 Within days, the Japanese delegation accepted the last American proposal. into diplomacy.

In addition, all of the signatory nations agreed that the herds would be managed in a scientific manner and that inspectors from each nation would have free access to the rookeries. At least partially out of a recognition of the aesthetic and scientific value of the fur seal, the four sealing nations had come to a compromise that allowed the species to survive. ^ When President Taft sent the requisite enabling legislation to Capitol Hill, he discovered that not all conservationists agreed with the administra tion's view of the sealing situation.

In fact, Jordan and many other leading scientists believed that excess males had to be harvested for the health of the herd.« The same publicity that had helped keep the pressure on the pelagic sealing nations now boomeranged. Under the influence of aggressive conser vationist William T. Hornaday and his ally, scientist Henry Elliott, Con gress decided that conservation required stricter controls on sealing. After a lengthy battle-complete with congressional hearings, vicious mudslinging, and a performing seal-Congress outlawed all sealing for five years. Taft and Nagel were stunned; without land sealing there would be no harvest to divide with the other powers. Japanese, Russian, and Canadian newspapers had already criticized the treaty as imbalanced, and Nagel worried that any of the three nations might now have sufficient reason to withdraw from the treaty. Unable to alter congressional opinion, Taft had no choice but to sign the bill outlawing all sealing until 1917.3s The congressional rebellion caught the administration napping because of a faulty assumption about the link between science and the conservation movement. Nagel and Anderson sought advice from a select group of ex perts, such as Jordan, who shared their views. They discounted Elliott and Hornaday as untrained lobbyists who would have no influence with the public or Congress when confronted with the scientific expertise that the 33- Protocols of Negotiations, North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty, u May 1911, RG 59, 711.417.

They miscalculated. The preservationist im pulse in Congress responded to Hornaday's masterful public relations cam paign and Elliott's warning that the administration's plan would extermi nate the seal herds. It was a valuable lesson for the nation's diplomats, who learned that even the best scientific experts could not deliver the unbending support of the entire conservation movement. Despite the unexpected events in Congress, the fur seal treaty accom plished the goals that scientists, conservationists, and diplomats desired. Instead of continuing the pattern of unchecked exploitation, the four na tions agreed to a cooperative system of resource use. The diplomatic, envi ronmental, and financial results were unassailable. By 1920, with sealskin prices around $140 each, the Pribilof sealing operation grossed over $1,000,000. The end of pelagic sealing and continued rational management of the rookery allowed the herd's population to rebound. By 1920 the herd had reached seven hundred thousand; by 1940 it had climbed to almost two m;u;™, )6 The North Pacific Fur Seal Convention succeeded because all concerned recognized that their national interests were best served by a cooperative agreement based on science. For twenty years, scientists had tried to end the unsustainable practice of pelagic sealing, until diplomats finally heeded their advice and came to an amicable agreement. The United States surren dered some control over its territory in exchange for the long-term security of the seal herd. Japan and Canada relinquished their right to hunt seals at sea in return for a guaranteed slice of the profits. In reaching this agree ment, all of the assembled diplomats had to make some compromises. And in so doing they acknowledged that conservation of the seals was consistent with the long-term interests of the countries around the northern Pacific. Going beyond the limited scope of the North Pacific Fur Seal Conven tion, the Migratory Bird Treaty (MBT) of 1916 still ranks as one of the greatest triumphs of international wildlife protection. On the domestic front, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 formed the basis for an upsurge of federal wildlife protection, including such programs as the National Wildlife Refuges. Internationally, the success of the treaty with Canada made possible similar treaties with Mexico, Japan, and the Soviet Union. While the original dream of treaty proponents-a hemispheric bird protection pact-has yet to be realized, their efforts prevented irreparable damage to the North American environment. In addition, the effort on behalf of the treaty was unique in the joint support it received from its inception from scientists, conservationists, and statesmen on both sides of the border. 37 36.

Sportsmen hunted traditional game birds such as ducks and grouse with ridiculously high state bag limits. Plume hunters collected egrets, terns, hummingbirds, and many songbirds for use in the millinery industry. Mar ket hunters pursued any edible birds that would fetch a price at hotels or restaurants. Finally, many common citizens shot just about anything for the pot at home. The death of the last passenger pigeon in 1914 in the Cincin nati Zoo proved that hunters could exterminate any species, no matter how numerous. National Association of Audubon Societies Secretary T. Gilbert Pearson expressed the nature of the problem: "It is chiefly the birds that could be commercialized, either for their flesh, or their feathers, that have suffered great diminution in numbers. "3* In a concerted effort to halt the slaughter of birds, conservationists rallied around the 1912 federal migratory bird bill, also known as the Weeks McLean bill. An outgrowth of earlier migratory game bird protection at tempts, Weeks-McLean was the first bill to include nongame birds as a ploy to lure broader popular support. The sponsors, Congressman John Weeks (R-MA) and Senator George McLean (R-CT), recognized that the state governments had inadequate bird protection provisions, which they barely enforced. Unless the federal government imposed uniform, adequate laws and provided the enforcement, many species of birds were headed toward extinction. Farmers, sportsmen, and bird lovers supported the bill as it headed for a vote in early 1913.39 There was one formidable obstacle in their path: William Howard Taft questioned the constitutionality of the Weeks-McLean bill. Taft firmly be lieved that wildlife protection was a state matter, as the Supreme Court had decided in 1896 in Geer v. Connecticut. The president made it clear that he would veto the bill if it passed during his term. In response, Senator Mc Lean buried the bird law as a rider to the Agriculture Department appropria tions bill, which landed on Taft's desk 4 March 1913, his last day in office. In a rush, Taft signed the bill without reading it, and the federal govern ment was in the business of protecting migratory birds.4° problems of habitat loss and pollution, its language is broad enough that future generations used the treaty to combat these problems. 38.

Although the resolutions had the same basic goal, the senators had different motives. Root sympathized mildly with the conserva tion movement, but he expressed anxiety about conservationists' tactics. He believed that the Weeks-McLean law was unconstitutional, but he thought that a treaty with another North American country could achieve the spon sors' worthy goals. As a former secretary of state, Root believed that such a treaty would be legal under Article 6 of the Constitution.41 McLean looked upon treaties as a means to expand bird protection throughout the hemi sphere, however, and his resolution had no geographical limitations. He realized that federal law was the only way to get uniform, and therefore adequate, protection in all forty-eight states. Likewise, the only reliable way to get fifteen or twenty countries to pass uniform laws was through iai mwuvaii uviiwv^u uiai iiiv viinvu uiaiv^o jiiuuiu take the lead in bringing bird protection to Latin America; otherwise, any advances made in the United States might be offset by lax laws in other American countries. Canada was not the first choice of conservationists or diplomats looking for a treaty partner. On 26 May 1913 the State Department asked the Agriculture Department to provide a draft of a treaty with Mexico, believ ing that such an agreement would be more useful: Hundreds of species crossed the U.S.-Mexican border; Mexico was in need of some bird protec tion statutes; and Canadian provinces already seemed to have adequate bird protection laws. By July, though, the State and Agriculture departments had changed their minds. The need for a quick resolution of the problem and the revolutionary upheaval in Mexico turned American attention north ward.Serious negotiations with Mexico on the subject did not begin until the 1930s. The decision to negotiate with Canada was more in line with Root's goals than with McLean's. A treaty with Canada would resolve the constitutional ity problem, but it would not vastly improve Canadian bird protection statutes. And in the short term McLean's goal of spreading bird protection laws throughout the hemisphere was unattainable. Scientists knew very trust and therefore had the right to enact any protective legislation necessary.

With the outbreak of the world war, both the State Department and External Affairs gladly handed birds over to the scientists. Canadian Do minion Entomologist Dr. C. Gordon Hewitt and the chief of the U.S. Biological Survey, Dr. E. W. Nelson, undertook responsibility for modify ing the original American proposal sent out in February 1914. Hewitt believed that "we cannot secure effective protection of our migratory game and insectivorous birds without the co-operation of the United States." He recognized that American conservationists were racing to get the treaty ratified before a test case on Weeks-McLean could come before the Su preme Court, and he worked tirelessly to get every province to approve the treatv retaliations.« Hewitt and Nelson agreed that the Weeks-McLean regulations were a good foundation upon which to build. The treaty divided migrants into game birds, nongame birds, and insectivorous birds-categories that were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Insectivorous and nongame birds re ceived almost complete protection, while the negotiators established compre hensive regulations for hunting game birds. Most notably they outlawed the practice of shooting waterfowl during the mating season, generally known as spring shooting. They did not, however, explicitly restrict pollution or habitat loss, two factors that in the long run would cause more harm than all of the shotguns in North America.« Although the biologists did their best to expedite the treaty, a few diplomats failed to see the importance of the measure. After a meeting with leadincr bird protectionists in ion. the solicitor of the State Henart ment concluded that "this seems to be going rather far in treaty making." In frustration, one ornithologist wrote to Nelson, "the treaty will go to the President when it is rescued from the State Department." For their part, British embassy staffers lost the version of the treaty that Canada had approved in June 1915, and embassy personnel realized the error in February 1916 only after the incorrigible William T. Hornaday came seeking answers for Canada's inexplicable silence. In the words of Ambas sador Sir Cecil Spring Rice, "owing to an unfortunate oversight due to 43- "International Treaty for the Protection of Migratory Birds," undated memorandum (early 1917) by C.

The rapidly growing Audubon association conducted an aggressive, somewhat covert, public relations cam paign. Local bird clubs organized letter-writing campaigns to the president and their congressmen. The gun and ammunition companies saw the link between effective game protection and their long-term viability and joined the fray. With American entry into World War I, bird protection became a war measure; conservationists claimed that the "winged squads of work men" deserved protection while guarding crops from insect hordes. One correspondent reminded President Woodrow Wilson that the enabling legis lation "should be considered at this most serious time, not only for the protection of the birds themselves, but for the conservation of the crops through the birds as destroyers of insect pests."t6 Opposition to the treaty was fierce but disorganized. Led by Senator James A. Reed (D-MO), those opposed to the treaty called it blatantly unconstitutional and dangerous. Reed equated a vote for the enabling legisla tion with shredding the Constitution. Congressman John Tillman (D-AR) said the law "should be bedecked with skirts, ruffled petticoats, and cork screw curls" because it "would feminize our boys."« Reed and his allies most of whom were from states along the Mississippi flyway-did not want to relinquish the right to shoot ducks in the spring, but they could not muster the votes in Congress to stop the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Unable to win in Congress, treaty opponents turned to the courts to overturn the law. Hunters in Missouri openly violated the regulations and publicly dared federal wardens to do anything about it. The journey to the Supreme Court began when warden Ray R Holland arrested Frank McAllister, attorney general of Missouri, for hunting ducks in March 1919. McAllister filed suit to prevent Holland from enforcing the law in the state and prepared to take the matter to the Supreme Court. In March 1920 he finally got his chance.t8 In Missouri v.

Based on the Geer precedent, he argued that wildlife was still held in trust by the states. Federal treaty-making power, according to McAllister, could only regulate items that fell within federal constitu tional limits. His opponent, the solicitor general of the United States, ar gued that federal treaty-making power overrode the Tenth Amendment. In particular, the federal government had an obligation to negotiate a treaty to protect American property in another nation.w While not accepting the solicitor's entire argument, Justice Oliver Wen dell Holmes issued a landmark decision in favor of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Holmes noted that "a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude is involved." In upholding the constitutionality of the MBTA, Justice Holmes continued, "we see nothing in the Constitution which com pels the government to sit by while a food supply is cut off and the protec tors of our forests and our crops are destroyed."'0 The Supreme Court had completely accepted the conservationists' logic and opened the way for the federal government to take the lead on other conservation issues. By any measure, the Migratory Bird Treaty was a great success. Hunting restrictions led to a noticeable increase in birds of all kinds within just a few years. With the power of the U.S. and Canadian federal governments be hind them, wardens were able to crack down on violators, and the publicity the treaty generated helped to advance public awareness of the value of birds in economic and aesthetic terms. But above all the treaty legitimized federal intervention into an area in which the states were incapable of acting. Despite the tailings or a lew individuals in Washington, the Migratory Bird Treaty illustrated the possibilities of cooperation among diplomats, scientists, and conservationists in the creation of environmental protection treaties. Both the Canadian and American foreign policy institutions al lowed government scientists to create the terms of the agreement before taking over to ensure that the formalities were in order. Hewitt revealed this dichotomy at one point: "I must confess that the necessity of the formal ratification of the treaty by the King was a surprise to me, but then we are not supposed to be diplomats."'1 After the diplomats did their part, conser vationists stepped in to sell the treaty to the public and to shepherd the requisite bill through Congress. Out of this process came a treaty and legislation that formed the basis for a host of future initiatives that even today protect North American wildlife. In the end, the MBT was the one treaty that set standards for future environmental protection agreements. The Inland Fisheries Treaty never received the proper enabling legislation from Congress; it finally died in 49- United States Reports, vol. 252 (1920), 417-28; the abbreviated legal citation for this case is 252 U.S. 416 (1920). 50.

The North Pacific Fur Seal Convention successfully brought the seal herds back from the brink of extinction, but it was so narrow in its focus that conservationists had a hard time building on it. The Migratory Bird Treaty provided protection for hundreds of species of birds and created a precedent for future initiatives. To a certain extent it repudiated the interpretation of the Constitution-and the general attitude toward natural resources—that had done so much to derail the fisheries treaty. The results of the treaties suggest that there were three factors that separated success from failure. First, the successful treaties had favorable cost/benefit ratios, both within each country and between them. Border state congressmen perceived that the fisheries treaty helped Canadian fisher men to the detriment of their American counterparts, so they voted down the most effective regulations. Similarly, until 1910 most Canadians op posed any American sealing proposal as an attempt to enrich the U.S. ireasury at tne expense or v&gt;anauian citizens pursuing a legitimate occupa tion. On the other hand, the Migratory Bird Treaty was obviously benefi cial to all except a small group of unscrupulous hunters. Second, a treaty stood a better chance when diplomats and scientists shared a common goal. The fisheries treaty suffered because the State Department found itself opposing the very scientist it had appointed to carry out the terms of the agreement. In contrast, the fur seal treaty came into being only when Canadian diplomats accepted the basic scientific premise that pelagic sealing was incompatible with the species's existence. The most comprehensive of the three, the Migratory Bird Treaty, featured a unique arrangement: Canadian and American scientists used their exper tise to decide both what was feasible and what was necessary; then they turned the matter over to diplomats to handle the official framing of the agreement. And finally, a diplomatic initiative of this type without public support was doomed to failure. Had there been an ichthyological version of the Audubon Society, the opponents of the Inland Fisheries Treaty might have been overwhelmed by public outcry at their short-sighted behavior. As it was, though, the public saved its breath for the efforts to save the seals and the birds. From a rational economic standpoint, the average American should have been more concerned with the availability of salmon than the supply of seal fur, but seals appealed to people in a way that fish never will. Birds, generalized as omnipresent, colorful songsters and voracious insecti vores, had an even higher favorable rating in the American psyche. Despite the obvious merits of all three treaties, international conservation agreements remained uncommon for three reasons: the conservation move ment lost the focus it had in the fight for the bird treaty as it turned toward a myriad of domestic problems; the special nature of the U.S.-Canadian relationship-the close economic, cultural, and political ties-that facilitated</page><page sequence="23">Scientists, Citizens, and Statesmen : 429 cooperation on natural resource issues was a rarity; and the combination of weak economic interests, strong public support, diplomatic cooperation, and scientific certainty that eased the way for the bird and seal treaties was very hard to find. In fact, the potential for a plethora of such far-reaching treaties did not coalesce again until a new wave of environmental awareness swept the United States in the 1970s.</page></plain_text>
