<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SISTER HAGGADAH AND ITS ־POOR RELATION־ EVELYN M. COHEN The scenes currently on the screen, of The Finding of Moses. Moses Presented to Pharaoh. Moses Killing an Egyptian Taskmaster. and Moses Saving Jethro' s Daughters. are from one of the best known illuminated Hebrew manuscripts from medieval Spain. They appear in a Haggadah that is housed today in the British Library in London, Or. Ms. 2884. In his Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts1. Bezalel Narkiss referred to the work as the "Sister" to the Golden Haggadah: later, in the volume of Spanish and Portuguese manuscripts in his Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts in the British Isles2, this moniker was shortened to the more manageable, Sister Haggadah. The name Golden Haggadah was used by him to designate another codex in the British Library, Add. Ms. 27210, which is notable for the lavish gold backgrounds in the scenes comprising its Biblical cycle. Narkiss' reason for relating the two works was based on similarities in their Biblical cycles in the "choice of subjects and in iconography"3. This similarity led him to conclude that the artists of these two works employed "a common model"4. The iconographic relationship between the two Haggadot is quite obvious and has been noted by other art historians. Although the arrangement of the Biblical cycles is different, with generally four scenes per page in the Golden Haggadah and two in the Sister Haggadah. the similarity in approach in some of these representations is in evidence in the two depictions seen here from the story of the Life of Moses. In the Golden Haggadah. all four subjects are included on folio 9r. Clearly, there is a vast dissimilarity in style; the illustrations obviously were produced by different workshops, with illuminators of greatly disparate artistic abilities. These two manuscripts are among the most widely-studied Sephardic Haggadot, largely because of the importance of the Biblical cycles which precede the text. 17</page><page sequence="2">EVELYN M. COHEN Seemingly derived from a different source, Ms. Mic. 9300 in The Library of The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, which is devoid of such a cycle, has not been subjected to much analysis. Its decorative program is relatively modest. In fact the first two quires are totally lacking ornamentation. Illumination does not appear until folio 15r, the first page of the third quire. The manuscript's decoration is limited to the adornment of the letters of initial words, the illumination of initial word panels, and three text illustrations, for Rabban Gamaliel, the matzah, and the maror. Although somewhat neglected in art- historical literature, the codex has an interesting and rather prestigious provenance. As is typical of medieval Sephardic Haggadot, this manuscript lacks a colophon or any reference to its scribe, illuminator or original patron. Inscriptions found on folio lr indicate the manuscript was sold in 1328, and again on the 13th of February 1334. Censors' signatures appear at the end of the text on folio 35v, revealing that the manuscript had been scrutinized by Fra Luigi da Bologna in 1600, and Fra Girolamo da Durallano in 1640. On Thursday, the 24th of Nisan [5]405, which is the 21st of April 1645, the manuscript was purchased in Modena by Abraham Joseph Solomon Graziano. Mention is made of the sale in inscriptions on folios lr, 2r, 7v, and 34v. Graziano, the Rabbi of Modena, was not a native son. He referred to himself as IshjGer, an abbreviation formed from the first letters of his given names, Avraham Yosef Shlomo, and the first two letters of his surname; the resulting appellation reflected his perceived status as a stranger. In addition to his role as Rabbi, Graziano is an interesting figure among the Jews of Italy as he is considered their first great collector of books. This is substantiated by the presence of his owner's inscription, which appears in numerous extant medieval manuscripts and early printed books. His abbreviated signature can be seen on both of the pages on the screen, as well as on six others in this manuscript. At some unknown point in time, this Haggadah from Graziano's collection became part of Elkan Nathan Adler's library in London, which was acquired by The Library of The Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1923. 18</page><page sequence="3">THE SISTER HAGGADAH You might be wondering why, having begun with rich illustrations from two of the most important fourteenth century Haggadot from Spain, you have been subjected to several minutes of viewing slides of mostly unadorned pages, in a poor state of preservation, from a relatively unknown codex. Granted, of the three manuscripts viewed so far, the Graziano Haggadah arguably has the most prestigious provenance. Also, most likely, it is the earliest of the three, although the Golden Haaaadah probably dates to the first quarter of the fourteenth century as well. Mendel Metzger, in his La Haaaadah enluminfee5, convincingly dates both manuscripts to the first quarter of the fourteenth century, though he believes the Seminary manuscript is slightly earlier. A date no later than the early fourteenth century is corroborated by the deeds of sale found at the beginning of the work. Returning to the Golden Haaaadah. the Biblical cycle terminates with contemporary scenes of the preparations for Passover. The text of the Haggadah that follows, however, has only three illustrations, and minimal illumination. For example, the initial word ve-she'eino. on folio 31v, is composed of charming zoo- and anthropomorphic forms, while the letters of the initial word va-votzi'einu. on folio 37r, are adorned simply with letters embellished with gold leaf. Although the Sister Haaaadah does contain eleven text illustrations, the initial word on folio 43r, of the same passage beginning with va-vot z i' einu. is the only area of illumination on this leaf. The layout of the two pages is remarkably similar; in this case it is plausible that a common model was used. The illumination is somewhat different however. Not only does the Sister Haaaadah have a colored panel, its letters are embellished with silver leaf. The same text in the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 15r, begins with the initial word written in silver letters as well. But that is not the only resemblance in these two manuscripts. The arrangement of the text on both of these pages is almost identical. In fact, although this passage looks similar in all three of these manuscripts, it is the Graziano Haggadah and Sister Haaqadah that are closest in format. This is not the only instance of a striking affinity between these two works. Moving on in the text, the initial words al ahat in the Golden Haggadah. folio 43r, and the Sister Haggadah. 19</page><page sequence="4">EVELYN M. COHEN folio 50r, have a somewhat related appearance. In both cases the lamed יs ascender rises into the upper margin and sprouts leaves on either side. The placement of the opening words is not similar, however. An examination of this text in the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 22r, once again shows the text written out in a manner that is almost identical to that of the Sister Haaaadah. In both cases the initial words appear at the very top of the page, above a text column of seven lines, with words spaced in an equivalent manner. In the Golden Haaaadah the opening of the passage concerning Rabbi Akiva begins at the end of folio 40v and continues unadorned at the top of folio 41r. The approach is quite different in the Sister Haaaadah. folio 47v, where the sage's name is placed at the top of the text column. The page has been designed rather strikingly by the scribe, with the kaf's descender bisecting the text and spreading out into the bottom margin where it issues leaves that fill out the space. Although visually appealing, it is not original, as the design was utilized at an earlier date in the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 19v. As can be seen here, the facing pages in these two manuscripts are arranged similarly as well; there is also an identical choice in the illumination of the letters of the initial words with Rabbi Akiva embellished in gold, and kama in silver. The letters of the initial words of the passage dealing with Rabban Gamaliel in the Golden Haaaadah. folio 43v, were written in large display script, illuminated in gold, and left without additional embellishment. In the Sister Haaaadah. folio 50v, however, the word Rabban alone is written in large letters, placed within a decorated word panel, and illuminated. The descender of the nun continues down into the bottom margin, where the sage is depicted within an architectural form. The approach is completely different in these two works; as you probably have surmised, the scribe of the Graziano Haaaadah wrote his text in a manner that was similar to that which was employed later by the the copyist of the Sister Haaaadah. In both, the letters of Rabban are illuminated in gold leaf and placed within a decorative panel. The nun descends into the lower margin, although in the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 22v, it terminates with foliate forms rather than with a depiction of Rabban Gamaliel. The sage is represented, however, in the outer margin of the 20</page><page sequence="5">THE SISTEFt HAGGADAH page. I was somewhat disheartened, though by no means surprised to discover that Mendel Metzger had noted an affinity between these two manuscripts in his La Haaaadah enlumin6e6. Although he does not mention the relationship in the page layouts, he notes the iconographic similarities found in these two works. He points out, for example, that the unusual motif of Rabban Gamaliel holding a scepter in his left hand and resting it on his shoulder appears in both of these representations. There are striking differences too, as in the Sister Haaaadah Rabban Gamaliel is in the company of two, rather small, students. Metzger also notes a similarity in approach in the illustration of the matzah. Both include a man holding the unleavened bread in his right hand. Although in the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 23v, the figure is depicted within the large illuminated image of the matzah in the center of the page, and in the Sister Haaaadah. folio 51v, he is represented in the outer margin, no figure is portrayed at all in the Golden Haaaadah. All three manuscripts display a highly decorative image of a matzah in the center of the text, and begin the passage with an illuminated initial word panel. It is in the Graz iano Haaaadah and the Sister Haaaadah. however, that the layout of four lines of text, including the division of words into two sections flanking the image of the matzah, are identical. The format in the Golden Haaaadah. folio 44v, is not. The maror is depicted within the text column in both the Golden Haaaadah and the Sister Haaaadah. folios 45v and 52r respectively. The arrangement of the text is different, however. In the Golden Haaaadah. the passage begins at the top of the page and the letters of the first two words, maror zeh. are illuminated in gold. The bitter herb itself is portrayed as an extremely stylized leaf, with a smooth outline. In the Sister Haaaadah. the passage begins on the fifth line. Only the letters of the first word are illuminated, this time in silver, and placed within a decorative panel. An illustration of a man holding the bitter herb in his left hand appears in the outer margin. The polylobed shape of the maror, which unfortunately is difficult to discern as it has faded with time, is quite different from that of the Golden Haaaadah. Although the representation on folio 24r in the Graz iano Haaaadah is not identical in this case, and no illustration is included in the margin, the 21</page><page sequence="6">EVELYN M. COHEN overall approach is similar to the Sister Haaaadah. Only the letters of the first word are illuminated, though in the earlier work they are covered with gold leaf and not contained within a panel. The general shape of the bitter herbs, its placement within the text, and the appearance of the lines of writing are remarkably similar in the two manuscripts. The pages of both Haggadot continue to relate in appearance, with a similar, though not identical, placement of the illuminated initial word bekhol. In both, the lamed's ascender divides the text and rises into the upper margin, splaying out and terminating in foliate forms. Likewise, the text for Hallel displays striking affinities, though its placement is not necessarily identical. Hallelujah, on folio 25v in the Graziano Haaaadah and folio 53v of the S i s t er Haaaadah. are remarkably similar. The same text in the Golden Haaaadah. folio 47r, is not as intimately related. Folio 50r of the Golden Haaaadah. which contains the passages beginning with shefokh and lo lanu. is one of the most beautiful in this manuscript. It does not correspond at all, however, to the appearance of this text on folio 57r of the Sister Haaaadah. Once again, although the figural forms differ, the relationship between the arrangement of the text in this manuscript and the earlier Graziano Haaaadah. folio 29r, is quite striking. The initial word shefokh is lined up with the inner margin, the descender of the final khaf divides the text, and only the initial word lo of lo lanu is contained in a panel and illuminated. The two pages are not immediately impressive in their resemblance, for although the scribes seem to have utilized a similar model, the illuminators were quite different in their approaches. Continuing on in Hallel, the text in the Golden Haaaadah. folios 52v to 53r is unrelated in appearance to the same passage in the Sister Haaaadah. folio 61r. Once again it is the Graziano Haaaadah. folio 33r, that seems to have been based on a common model. The next two folios in both works display similarly copied passages, although once more, the illumination is quite different. The Sister Haaaadah. which contains almost four times as many text illustrations as the Graziano Haaaadah. 22</page><page sequence="7">THE SISTER HAGGADAH includes a depiction of a supplicant figure at the bottom of the page. In both Haggadot, however, the nun's descender divides the text. The final passage of Hallel in the Golden Haaaadah. folios 54v to 55v has some commonality with the Sister Haaaadah. folios 62v to 63r. In the Graziano Haaaadah. folios 34v to 35r, the spacing of the text is somewhat more intimately related, though not as successfully arranged as in the Sister Haaaadah. It should be noted that throughout this lecture, you have been viewing the pages that are most alike in the Graziano Haaaadah and the Sister Haaaadah. Clearly not all are identical; at times, as in the text of Davyenu. all three of the manuscripts under discussion differ considerably, and seem to derive from unrelated prototypes. Many questions remain concerning the use of models in the making of medieval Haggadot, regarding both the arrangement of the text and the use of illumination. Interestingly, the image of the maror in the Seminary manuscript was pricked for transfer; tiny holes can be seen along the outline. Although it is difficult to be certain, it seems these prickings were made after the illumination was completed, as they pierce through the silver leaf on the verso. They probably were used, therefore, to transfer the design to another work. In medieval manuscripts the scribe and the illuminator frequently were not the same person. It is clear from manuscripts like British Library Add. 14761, sometimes referred to as the Barcelona Haaaadah. that the copyist wrote his text in a way that allowed for the illustrations to be added later. The image of the maror was not executed with the rest of the illuminations in the fourteenth century. The depiction that appears today was added at a much later date. Curiously the layout here is very similar to that of page 71 in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek Ms. Or. Fol. 569, in which a large blank space appears where the maror was intended to be portrayed. The exact relationship between the Graziano Haaaadah and the Sister Haaaadah is yet to be determined. The first two, unillumslnated, quires in the earlier work have nothing in common with the Sister Haaaadah. Beginning with the initial word va-votzi'einu on folio 15r, the two 23</page><page sequence="8">EVELYN M. COHEN works suddenly are very similar and must be based on a common source. Upon close inspection it becomes clear that there was an abrupt change on this page. Beginning with the initial word, the dimension of the letters is slightly altered and the brown ink is somewhat darker. From here on the pages are more uniformly cut. Actually the text that immediately precedes the initial word is not the same as in the Sister Haaaadah; in the Seminary manuscript the verse of the proof text is omitted. It seems likely that at this point in the manuscript a new scribe began copying on this page, abruptly moving on to the next passage, utilizing a model that was related to the one employed for the Sister Haaaadah. Unlike the first scribe, the second planned his initial words with letters large enough to accommodate illumination. He also confined his text to within the vertical ruling on the left; the earlier, less proficient copyist often overlapped the ruling, sometimes writing sections of words within the margin. Although older, and perhaps less charming and colorful than the Sister Haaaadah. from folio 15r on, the Graziano Haaaadah clearly derives from a shared ancestor. The Seminary Haggadah generally has been ignored by art historians in search of lavish illuminations and rich iconographic ties. All that glitters is not gold, however, and sometimes true kinship is overlooked, especially in a "poor relation". NOTES 1. Bezalel Narkiss, Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts. Jerusalem, 1969, p. 58. 2.
