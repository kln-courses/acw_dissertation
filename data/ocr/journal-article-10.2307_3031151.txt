<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Anthropological Thought A. L. KROEBER Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berke- ley, Dr. Kroeber, at the time of writing was visiting Professor of Anthro? pology at Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts. He was 1945 Huxley Memorial Medalist, 1946 Viking Fund Medalist in General An? thropology, and Chairman of the Wenner-Gren Foundation's 1952 Inter? national Symposium on Anthropology. His principal volumes are Con- figurations of Culture Growth, 1944; Anthropology, 1948; and The Nature of Culture, 1952. COLLECTIVE thought tends to move ponderously, and 1952-1954 is a short period. The roots of the thinking that has reached a new stage, or has come into focus in these three short years, almost always reach back a decade or more. It will some? times be necessary to follow them back to their beginnings; but I have tried to give special attention to those phases that have warmed to recent radiance or that suggest an impending burst of development. As such I construe an important rap- prochement of biological and cultural study, with which I commence. The well established old-line subjects of ethnology, archeology, and biological anthropology have progressed expectably and steadily rather than being upset by any re-rout- ing of highways and overnight settlements, so that they require little comment in the present short-term review. But I have in? cluded some novel items in linguistic and culture history. Then follows another brief section on general theory and methods; after which attention shifts first to the still formative subject of values and finally and at greatest length to the fringe subjects, beginning with personality, which have in- vaded anthropology from neighboring so? cial science rather than developing au- tonomously from its older native roots. If I say nothing about acculturation, it is because I find no novelties there. In fact it seems that there is some tendency for the focus to shift back toward the assimila? tion which was originally so strong in the subject. The native nationalities or immi? grant minorities involved are numerous, but the outcome is pretty uniform: absorp- tion into the rural or urban proletariat; it is chiefly the rate and details that vary. I do not know why these monotonous studies continue to be made except that budding anthropologists have firmly?and perhaps soundly?got it into their heads that the anthropologist's hall-mark is the fact of having made a face-to-face study of living people. So they will do a community-study at all costs even if they have to invent some "hypothesis" to hang it on to, and without worrying too much whether it contributes any new ideas. And I suppose that, as re- gards having had the experience, they are right. As to whether I am right in seeing no essentially new ideas in this stream of output, I am of course not the one to affirm. But if I am wrong, citations of evidence will be easy.1 i The report of the Social Science Research Coun- cil's 1953 Summer Seminar on Acculturation has appeared in the December 1954 number of the American Anthropologist since the above was written. 293</page><page sequence="2">294 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 BIOLOGICAL RELATIONS A development in biology that is of definite pertinence to anthropology has been the increasing filling-out and enrich- ment of findings and understanding of or? ganic evolution, as the precondition of cul? tural growth. This neo-evolutionistic move? ment must be distinguished from the early or first-half-century pulse of Darwinian evo? lution, in which a broad theoretic-polemical element still predominated, adaptation was fully recognized, but heredity and variation remained vague and fluid. In the opinion of many biologists, this older doctrine of evolution after a time almost suffered ship- wreck; but once the new science of genetics hit its stride two decades or so after the turn of the century, and began to realize its potential, a rapprochement was effected, between it and evolutionary biology, which grew more intimate and drew in many other lines of biological research, from cytology and ecology to paleontology and taxonomy. For the non-biologist, the spear- head of exposition of this great forward lunge is to be found in the writings of Julian Huxley, as exemplified for instance in Evolution the Modern Synthesis, 1942; Evolution in Action, 1953, and, with co- editors, Evolution as a Process, 1954. To these books must be added a paper written for the Columbia Bicentennial and to be published early in 1955, on "Man's Place and Role in Nature," in which Huxley elaborates his basic position as less formally presented in 1951 at a Wenner-Gren Foun? dation supper-conference. In these late works, Huxley passes on from biological to psychosocial or cultural or "noetic" evolution, which is limited to man, operates by different mechanisms, but has already proceeded to a point where it potentially dominates the sphere of life and presumably can direct it hereafter. At any rate, he holds that no fundamental improvements in merely biological level and efficiency any longer seem likely or even possible. Huxley realizes fully that a critical point was passed when a method of transmission and transformation of tradi? tion was evolved by our early human ancestors. The significance of this view is that it completely departs from the position of biologists a generation or two ago, when they either largely ignored culture or saw in it a sort of secondary modification or extension or epiphenomenon of biology, and racism and eugenics had vogue. Hux? ley fully accepts that noetic or cultural activity proceeds on a separate level which is relatively new, is autonomous, and which, in contrast with organic evolution, still possesses untouched potentialities. He goes on to consider "noetic integrators" of pos? sible future cultural development which are of a scope to dwarf as miniature any plans yet envisaged by applied anthropologists. In any event, we have a new through- highway bridge-building between biology and the psychology-anthropology-humani- ties inquiries which deal with culture; and it is gratifying, and an assurance of perma- nence of the new connection, that this pushing out forward has come mainly from biology. Reciprocating efforts are naturally called for, and the beginnings of these are visible in several directions. Such are in? creased emphasis on the particular basis in biology which preconditions culture, on the nature of our ancient and seemingly deathless friend "human nature," and on the problem of "progress" or whatever we may wish to name the counterpart of "di? rection" in biological level. The first of these possibilities is exempli- fied by Weston LaBarre's recent book The Human Animal, 1954. The initial half- dozen chapters of this, with fervid convic? tion and real eloquence, deal with "the human animal" in the most literal sense of the phrase?at more length and with greater concentration than a somewhat correspond- ing chapter on "Man's Place in Nature" (the title consciously borrowed from Thomas Henry Huxley) in Kroeber's 1948 Anthro? pology. Two others of LaBarre's chapters (8 and 9) portray not only the limitations, but also the genuine significance of human race, genetics, and domestication?this last term used outright, without qualification by the prefix "self." Their special importance is in moving in the direction of maintaining "physical" anthropology in rapport with</page><page sequence="3">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 295 "cultural." The thirteenth chapter develops the thesis that a psychosis and a culture differ only quantitatively?one being indi? vidual, the other social. Throughout, the volume remains true to its title in viewing culture as something unique developed in an animal. human nature Human nature, or "the natural," also once known as the "psychic unity of man? kind," into which so many nineteenth-cen- tury anthropologists dipped to draw up inspirational buckets of speculation, was thereafter long shunned as an unknown and unknowable, but is once more being nibbled at. It was the subject of a sym? posium at the 1952 national meeting of the American Anthropological Association, from which at least one paper has appeared, by Spiro (1953) on "Human Nature in its Psychological Dimensions." One point Spiro develops probably will be generally accepted, that the distinction formerly often made, between man's innate "basic" drives and his socially acquired ones, cannot prop- erly be maintained, or at least is fruitless. However, when Spiro finds that because acquired drives are as "natural" to man as his biological ones they therefore constitute another psychic dimension of his unique nature, this appears to be essentially a re- statement of man's unique symbolizing ca? pacity rather than another distinct "dimen? sion." Spiro's final conclusion that it is personality that constitutes human nature seems again to reduce to, or at least derive from, faculty for symbolization; if there is more than that in the conclusion, it eludes me?perhaps from the compression of the article. Spiro sees needs, values, ego processes, and defense mechanisms as pre- requisites of culture. As a universal need he cites a world view. I would see a world view as part of culture itself. If a world view is universal in cultures we may infer that it springs from a corresponding psy? chological need, but I cannot see that such an inference adds anything that is more than verbal. We do know a good deal that is specific about world views, but the need remains quite vague. Similarly for values; are they not definitely again in culture? That there is "an imperative dimension in human behavior" is true enough; but to the individual his value imperatives come mainly from his culture, and the culture has them because human beings symbolize. I have ready for publication an article which tries to reopen the problem of hu? man nature without recourse to personality, but by a double approach from biological behavior and back from cultural mani- festations without reference to the enu- merative "universal pattern." The proposal is to review and reinterpret the nearest sub- human approaches to what man does in and through culture, and to plot the per- imeters or extremities of total known cul? ture as an indication of how far human nature can go, or at least has gone, and therefrom infer its area and "content." What this approach may yield remains to be seen; but at least it is offered as a coun? ter balance to the approach through per? sonality, which seems to me much more likely to be the product of human nature plus culture, than its prerequisite or basis. We may expect increased attention to this subject in the coming years. After all we can hardly forever leave the psychic equipment of man a blank except for a few reflexes, no instincts, and a faculty for symbolization; at least not without a try. As to progress in culture, Huxley accepts it as unhesitatingly as he accepts progress in living matter; and Redfield (1953) agrees in The Primitive World and Its Trans- formations (especially chapter 6). Redfield (1953, p. 159) finds that when anthropolo? gists threw out the nineteenth-century bath water of "progress" as a mere assumption of faith, they also threw out a tangible baby of undeniable progress, and threw it far enough for its cry not to reach their ears. It is by now clear that Redfield is right; the problem is not whether there is prog? ress, but of what it consists and what has been its precise if fluctuating route. We can admit progress and still remain whole- hearted, non-weaseling cultural relativists. To become aware of ethnocentrism is to begin to discount it intellectually. We do</page><page sequence="4">296 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 not have to flop from the absolutism of ethnocentricity to the equally absolute paralysis of relativism blown up into a total negation. Genuine relativism is a safe- guard against ethnocentrism, not an in- discriminate enshrinement of all values as untouchably sacrosanct. If values are to be dealt with in culture study?as it is pleasant to note that Huxley (1953, p. 150) takes for granted?they have to be characterized, de? fined, "weighed" to be compared; and it is of their nature that "measurement" of them, at least at first and possibly always, will be more effective qualitatively than quantitatively. If that means that value judgments can not be wholly kept out of organized value study, so be it: better to err a little than to renounce all under? standing for a taboo. We are not physicists. And is it not time to realize that for stu? dents of culture to fear that they may lapse into ethnocentricity is almost as belatedly pedantic as it would be for chemists to be on their guard against becoming Rosicru- cianly anthropomorphic? TIME DEPTHS AND BASIC TYPES OF LANGUAGES In linguistics there are two developments to chronicle, both of definite interest to cultural anthropologists in their results, and both using quantitative expression. The first is Swadesh's glottochronological method, which is simple in principle, being lexical comparison, though sound and ex- act data are needed and judgments must be critical. To this comparison there is brought a hypothetical assumption that the rate of inner or automatic change of all languages tends to be closely similar. There is some preliminary evidence from languages with known history that this assumption is ap? proximately correct. Basing from these cases, Swadesh converts percentages of re- maining similarity of vocabularies into cen? turies elapsed since separation of two lan? guages, with results running up into millennia and on the whole conforming to extant impressions as to classification of language groups. The strict constancy of rate of change remains unproved; but it can be disproved or corrected only by test- ing more cases, so that further prosecution of the method is urgently desirable, whether one's faith in it be positive or negative. Mine is definitely affirmative, on the basis of internal consistency of results within groups universally accepted as related; but as a full weighing of evidence is lengthy, I refer to an article on the subject I have in press in International Journal of Ameri? can Linguistics. Swadesh's method bids fair to rival dendrochronology and carbon 14 as a time indicator. Ranges above 8000 still seem uncertain, but from 2000 to 5000 years fairly precise determinations appear reliably attainable if not already in hand. Greenberg (1954) has reviewed the old problem of types of language, which took shape with normative and ethnocentric classifications by nineteenth-century Ger? man idealists from Schlegel to Schleicher and Max Mueller ("agglutinative, isolating, inflectional"), and which since then has lain fallow except for Sapir's 1921 morpho- logical classification, which some anthro? pologists have shown an interest in, but nearly all linguists have tended to walk around. Greenberg sets up ten morpho- logical indices, these expressing scale-fre- quencies of occurrence of the structural features of synthesis, agglutination, com- pounding, derivation, gross inflection, pre- fixing, suffixing, isolation, pure inflection, and concord in eight selected languages. The statistical results check very interest- ingly against the relationships and what is known of changes in the languages. Four of the eight languages are pairs of earlier and later stages in two Indo-European line- ages: Anglo-Saxon and English, Sanskrit and modern Persian. Both definitely go down in "synthesis"?from 2.12 to 1.08 and from 2.59 to 1.59?up in agglutination, and run similarly parallel in seven of the eight other traits. Annamese, the one "isolating" language of the eight, comes out extreme in nearly all indices: lowest seven times, highest once: it seems to stand at one end of the total range of structural possibilities. Eskimo, on the contrary, scores four max- ima and four minima in ten features, which suggests strong characterization in different morphological directions. Bantu stands see-</page><page sequence="5">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 297 ond in this regard. But the four Indo- European languages rate highest or lowest only twice in 20 times as against a chance probability of 10 in 20. They thus seem generalized rather than specialized in struc? ture. These samples show the interest which results from the method promise to have. The construction of the indices and appli? cation of data to them can no doubt be improved with more experience, but seem simple, practical, and inspire faith. Lin- guists, in virtue of being perfectionists by profession, will presumably shake their heads and pick flaws for a time. But it looks as if Greenberg has set up a milestone?and one of an interest to non-linguists com- parable to Whorfs metalinguistic essays but more open to proof. culture history A line of thought related to the Ton- nies community-society distinction (Ge- meinschaft versus Geselischaft) began to be worked on by Redfield as far back as the Tepoztlan days (tontos and correctos) and was later (1941-1947) developed by him into a folk-sophisticate and folk-urban polarity or continuum. In his 1953 volume, The Primitive World and Its Transforma- tionsj he elasticizes the idea by adding the peasant as a "human type." The influence of Childe's vast material and restated inter? pretations is evident in this increment. Perhaps also there was a reaction to Sjo- berg's attempt (1952) to inject the not wholly apropos concept of a "feudal" type. To Redfield (1953, p. 31 and chapter 2) a peasantry is brought into existence by the city. Peasants are long-indigenous rural natives whose order of life takes important account of the city?economically, politi- cally, and morally. They are part of a larger society, religion, and state, use its money, are affected by its writing and law. The concept of course is old in common knowledge and in history, especially in long-settled stable regions such as Europe and China, but has been rather outside the experience of most Americans, and our anthropologists and sociologists have tended not to think in terms of it.2 In Europe, on the contrary, peasant "culture" (as distinct from economy) has been called foik culture and foik lore; whereas to Americans "foik" tends to denote the rural illiterate prole- tariat, or Mexican Indians, or sometimes our own Indians. The concept of peasant is certainly needed in any wider compara? tive overview, and is likely to stay with us. Of genuine interest is a brief book now available in English translation, Farewell to European History, 1948, by the histori- cally-minded sociologist Alfred Weber, brother of Max. The relation between the two is illustrated by Alfred reacting pro- ductively against the irritant of Spengler much as Max reacted to Marxian doctrine. Weber wrote this "sketch" during the clos- ing months of the collapse of Germany in 1945. It is concerned largely with the "Nihilism" which he pictures as overtaking the West, with its focal point in Germany. It ends with a chapter on "Intimations of Transcendence in the Realms of the In- animate, Animate, and Spirit" written in a language of the past. Yet the introduction and first chapter present a vivid view of Western Europe as a unique phenomenon in human history, with its extraordinarily strong and varied dynamism expressed in a rapid succession of economic and socio- political phases, and tensely charged with impulses toward inner revolution or out- ward explosion. The changes sought in this culture were in idealistic rather than ma? terial ends; no other civilization, Weber finds, was "shot through with Absolutes" to the same degree as the Occidental, due to the flooding of the immature but vigor- ous peoples of the West by both Christian- ity and developed classic intellectualism; The "Homeric period" of Europe is set by Weber from 1000 to 1250. After this there follow loosening and break-up of dogma, redogmatization, nineteenth-century con- sumation, and destruction. Judgments may vary about the main body of the book and about its value in comparison with 2 Somewhat as in the political sphere we are only incipiently aware of the real resemblance of native high-Mexican political units to the Old World city states, from Sumer to the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="6">298 Yearbook of Anthropology-1955 other interpretations; but the comparative delineation of Western civilization in its youth has much originality. For a dozen, in fact twenty years now, Gordon Childe's transformative interpreta? tion of Old World pre-history as history, based equally on vast control of knowledge and extraordinary integrative ability, and riveted tighter in successive books, has dom- inated our thinking about some five mil- lennia of the story of man. Thematically central have been his major revolutions, the Neolithic and the Urban. I acknowl? edge as much personal influence as anyone. However, a dozen years are a long time for an ideology as precise as this one to hold unchallenged sway. The first indications of challenge seem at hand. For instance, Redfield in his just-cited The Primitive World and Its Transforma- tions makes minor emendations on the rela? tive importance of the two revolutions (1953, p. 6) and on the moral order of the Paleolithic communities (1953, p. 16). Carle- ton Coon's The Story of Man, whose range is from the earliest men to 1954 and its out- looks, differs not at specific points, but in attempting a new mold. It is in no sense antithetical?Childe is mentioned once?but it starts from the same facts to chart its own course. It is a fresh, spontaneous, vivid retelling of the human story, original in choice of materials, approach, and illustra- tions. It is more narrative than LaBarre's, but similar in fervor and versatility of phrasing. Howells' Back of History, 1954, written with the pleasing skill to which he has accustomed us, departs less from the Childe pattern, though it does include the surviv- ing ethnographic primitives and native America. GENERAL THEORY AND METHOD Bidney's important Theoretical Anthro? pology represents something of a reversion from the current anthropological trend, in that values are considered primarily as categories with reference to aesthetic, moral, and ideological norms, and that "normative science" is set up as something that "does make for absolute standards and is also compatible with freedom of inquiry and cultural progress" (1953, p. 432, summing up chapter 14). Propositions like these are large and difficult, and I do not believe they can be settled or even weighed wholly within anthropology. I suspect that Bidney is enunciating them from the framework of philosophy from which he came as a welcome recruit to anthropology. He evi- dently sees cultural relativism as a nihilistic principle and destructive near-illusion. I admit that it can become so to the fearful and defeatist, to those without aesthetic sensitivity, or to the moralist who knows his norm. I doubt that relativism must be? come nihilistic in its effects. I abhor nega- tivism, and yet live with satisfaction in a plural, fluctuating, probing human world. That is an individual attitude; but I set it against Bidney's attitude which seems to me at bottom equally personal, though he has reenforced it with argument which I am not enough trained philosophically to refute with skill. I do think if Bidney wants to convert anthropologists to the "absolute standards of normative science," he will have to begin with more tolerance for the relativistic viewpoint that we have adjusted to, and for the rich variety of the cultural and natural values we experience under it. Cer? tainly many of us would not know how to proceed with the anthropology which is our life work if we had to spend our time henceforth measuring how far the many imperfect values of the human cultures we know fall short of an absolute norm. Per? haps, as first step toward a rapprochement, he can rephrase his portrayal of this norm in a manner less shocking to some of us. Another point that Bidney touches on in his book is "creativity" (1953, pp. 148, 177- 178). It is evident that one meaning which this term has is the discovery or achieve? ment of new values. It is also clear that individuals as well as cultures and periods differ in kind as well as degree of their creativity; and that in concerning itself with values, anthropology is also concern? ing itself with creativity. Bidney is aware of this, but he skirts the subject with ref- erences to freedom and intelligence, hu-</page><page sequence="7">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 299 manism, voluntary effort. In my Configura- tions, in using genius as my principal index of comparative value achievements, I was certainly implying individual creativity, though, as I was concerned with historic profiles of cultures, I abstracted from the personalities of the geniuses dealt with. I took for granted that they possessed enough force and freedom to exercise creativity, and I then used the products of this cre? ativity as a measure of the cultural growth or historical configuration of which they formed a part. It is therefore not because I wish to deny creativity that I raise the point of what Bidney means with his use of the term. Along with it he speaks of humanism, personalistic approach, freedom and intelligence, determination of cultural destiny, until one wonders whether he is not excepting free creativity as something outside the realm of nature. Such a view was once traditional in the humanities, and is no doubt still often maintained in spots in their isolation. If there are any anthro? pologists or other scientists that hold this position, they are few. I think Bidney owes us an answer to the question: Is his free humanistic creativity in nature or outside it?3 Ackerknecht has written an important paper "On the Comparative Method" in the volume in honor of Wallis, Method and Perspective in Anthropology, 1954. He points out how comparative anatomy un- derlay Darwinism and made its swift de- cisive triumph possible, and how when for? mal anthropology was launched it availed itself of an analogous approach for culture, which continued unquestioned until Boas's 1896 challenge. Ackerknecht holds that in modified form comparison has remained in use wherever the approach was historically oriented?which is true; and he believes it will be revived increasingly. He also points out that the pre-evolutionary idea of prog? ress was well established in the cultural field before 1800, nearly a century before evolution broke through in biology. This fact suggests another: namely that through its Hellenic as well as Judaic ele? ment our Western civilization was long committed to a static world view and im? posed this on its science. Only the history of human beings and nations was allowed as unstable, though their changes consisted of accidentals and was meaningless as against the fixed master plan of the world. It was not until the later eighteenth cen? tury that the improvement of telescopes allowed astronomy to begin to become the historical science it is now, to be followed by geology and then biology, with universal human history being at least envisaged and sketched about contemporaneously with the rise of historical astronomy. One need only review the status of total Occidental thought and knowledge by 50-year periods since 1700 to realize that historicism in the wider sense consistently has made gains and is still gaining. Its spread and accumula- tions, while less showy than those of ex- perimental science, have been equally con- sistent and great. The early evolutionistic anthropologists failed because they possessed no analyzed and classified corpus of comparative knowl? edge of culture similar to that which biol? ogy had accumulated ready for reinterpre- tation by 1859. It was this corpus that enabled biology rapidly to transform the generic concept of evolution into a solidly- firmed history of life. Without counterpart of this, the "classic" anthropologists could only guess at over-all formulae and try to support them with partisanly selected evi? dence. Robert Spencer in the same 1954 volume as Ackerknecht discusses "The Hu- manities in Cultural Anthropology," fol? lowing farther Ruth Benedict's presidential address of 1947 and a passage in Evans- Pritchard's Social Anthropology, 1951. Spencer accepts the Benedict contention that, point for point, problems discussed in the humanities are closer to those in anthropology than are most investigations in social science. This is precisely the posi? tion elaborated?from another premise? farther on in the present essay (p. 307). Other points of corroboration or extension of Spencer's position can be found on 3 Since this passage was written, Spencer has reviewed Bidney's book in the December 1954 number of the American Anthropologist, making much the same point.</page><page sequence="8">300 Yearbook of Anthropology-1955 pp. 282-283 of my "Summary" to the volume. VALUES The subject of values is one that has been consciously faced in anthropology in the last ten years, and increasingly so. Values were long regarded as unscientific and as improper to introduce into scientific context. Actual reference of course was mainly to value judgments; that is, ratings of values as better or worse. Gradually it dawned on anthropologists that we were actually describing, defining, and analyzing out characteristic values in every broader or integrative picture of a culture?in every ethnographic account that was more than an atomistic enumeration. Cultural con? tent, I said in 1946, fails into patterns as regularities of form and style and signifi? cance, and it embodies values which may be formulated or felt by the society, and which it is part of our business as anthro? pologists to characterize and define.4 This was stated not programmatically but as descriptive of established practice in his? tory as well as anthropology. The one re? striction specified was that recognition of values must be physiognomic and compara? tive, not ethnocentrically normative. These dicta made no particular stir but aroused no particular contradiction. In short, anthropologists have long recog? nized that there are cultural values and have occasionally referred to them more or less specifically, mostly without examining the concept abstractly. Endeavors to deal deliberately both with particular values and with a theoretic formulation of values in general have characterized the last dec? ade and especially quinquennium. The largest forward lunge was the estab- lishment in 1949 at Harvard University of a six-year program for "Comparative Stud? ies of Values in Five Cultures" by the Laboratory of Social Relations. The five cultures are represented by Zuiii, Navaho, Spanish-American, Mormon, and Texan communities in the "Rimrock" area of New Mexico. The instigating spirit was Kluck- hohn's; the field workers, associates, coordi- nators, and other participants have been numerous and, besides members of the four groups in the Department of Social Relations, have included philosophers, economists, political scientists, musicolo- gists, etc. Monographs and articles have been issued since 1951; several large-scale ones are now in proofs and should be is? sued before the present lines appear. It will be a year or two more before the find? ings as a whole are available and the re? sults appraisable?presumably by the next issue of this Yearbook. The activity has been concerted and great; it has already drawn the subject out from its long limbo. Theoretically, the basic paper is Kluck- hohn's "Values and Value-Orientations . . .," 1951, subtitled "An Exploration in Definition and Classification." Kluckhohn defines values as conceptions of desirables. The conceptions may be explicit or im- plicit, characteristic of individuals or of groups. The desirables influence selection from available modes, means, and ends of action. Values are abstracted not from neu- rological properties but from behavioral events, verbal and non-verbal. They are consistently connected with approvals and disapprovals. Value concepts, being pointed at desirables, are emancipated from im? mediate physiological stresses and from ephemeral, merely specific situations. Verbalizability is said to be a necessary test of value. Accordingly, instinctual be? havior and needs, being below the level of abstraction, are not part of the realm of value. Values are mostly cultural products, but they are given private interpretations. In fact, idiosyncratic values account for changes in group values. In cultural sys? tems, values give consistence and congru- ence; in personalities, dependability and regularity. Above all, they add a necessary element of predictability to social life. Values always have an affective as well as cognitive dimension; wish and appraisal are united in them. Kluckhohn then proceeds toward a classi- 4 Slightly condensed from The Nature of Culture (1952), No. 11, pp. 104-105.</page><page sequence="9">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 301 fication of values by their dimensions as follows: Modality: positive, negative. Content: aesthetic, cognative, moral. Intent: mode, instrumental, goal. Generality: specific (including role), the- matic. Intensity or Incidence: categorical, preferen- tial, hypothetical (Utopian traditionalistic); cen? tral, peripheral; dominant, variant, deviant. Explicitness: explicit, implicit. Extent: idiosyncratic, personal (private), group, universal. Organization: isolated, integrated. Finally Kluckhohn reviews the relation of values to attitudes, motivation, cathexis, needs, goals, acquired drives, utility, func? tions, sanctions, ideals, belief, and ideology. It is obvious that we have here the no- table groundwork for a systematic theory of values and a segregation and sharpening of the conceptual tools for their empirical study. If I dissent, it is at one particular point only so that I may not be thought to assent now where I have differed before: in regard to universal values. I believe the proba- bility is high that there are universal hu? man values; I distrust the motivation of seeking them; I do not believe they can be established by random enumeration. Witness the haphazard and tattered list compiled by so sharp a mind as Linton's in his posthumous paper of 1954. What we need is an approach that is conceptually more adequate. Another and distinct facet of the interest in values was first worked out by the sociol? ogists Alfred Weber (1920, already men? tioned above), Maclver (1931, pp. 225-236; 1942, pp. 272-288), Merton (1936). This was the tripartite segmentation, by Weber, of the sociocultural stream of phenomena into non-cumulative "cultural movement," accumulative "civilizational" process, and "social" process. Merton distinguished the two former ingredients as subjective and objective; Maclver, as social ends and social means. Subsequently, Maclver recognized three "orders": the cultural, technological, and social. This is close to Weber's formu? lation, except that Weber includes eco- nomic-political activity in his social process, and science in his civilizational, whereas Maclver is inclined to transfer economics and politics to his "technological" order, but fails to place science in it.5 Kroeber (1952, pp. 152-166) subsequently suggested renaming the first two segments "value cul? ture" and "reality culture,"?to which "so? cial culture" would correspond for the third segment when the approach was pri? marily cultural, or "society" or "social action" when the weighting rather was sociological. He inclines to separate pure science from technology and place it at least partly in the value segment on the operational ground that historically science has generally behaved like philosophy, re? ligion, and the arts in developing in inter- mittent spurts. He was non-committal on the question of assignment of economic and political behavior, where Weber and Maclver differed. He would now tend to see political structure and function as an extension of social, but on the other hand to construe economic activities as predomi? nantly in the reality angle, again on the operational ground that wealth tends to accumulate through history?though sub? sistence economy tends to go on repetitively like society. Moreover he has pointed out that actually it is not so much a matter of segments into which the total range of culture can be subdivided as of positions on a three-cornered scale. He cites a con- tinuum from technology to science to phi? losophy to religion to the arts and back to aspects of technology. Sorokin (1947, p. 317; 1950, p. 197) touched the problem tangentially in his classification of culture into "pure systems" and "mixed or derivative" ones. His pure systems number six: language, science, phi? losophy, religion, fine arts, ethics. It is ob? vious that the last five all relate to or contain values, just as they are all ideo- logical. Technology, economy, and politics Sorokin includes among his "mixed or de- e The old Cooley and Park dichotomy of "moral order" and "technical order" referred perhaps more to two kinds of societies than to two kinds of cul? ture, but Redfield (1953, pp. 20-22) has brought it into appropriate relation to his primitive-folk and urban-civilized distinction discussed above.</page><page sequence="10">302 Yearbook of Anthropology-1955 rivative" systems. He does not recognize a "social" system within culture because he has previously separated the societal from the cultural aspect of the sociocultural world. Thurnwald (1950, pp. 38, 104, 107) had construed technological "civilization" as an irreversible accumulative process with which "culture" operates as a means; cul? ture is defined enumeratively but without explicit reference to values. These distinctions are likely to be fol? lowed further in the next few years. As of the turn of 1954, they are beginning to appear in program titles. Their main con? cern is not so much the topological classi? fication of culture by application of obvi? ous common sense, as it is to advance its qualitative analysis. It is something to real? ize that values are not uniformly diffused through culture but concentrated in some of its activities. The same is true as regards the quality of accumulativeness, which is now visible as a variable within culture rather than a constant criterion distinguish- ing all cultural from all organic evolution. This area of thought thus is one in which several important concepts intersect: val? ues, accumulation, progress, cultural repeti- tion of parallelism, and the role of culture in evolution. If in addition to classification of any of these concepts, there results a more meaningful classification of the areas or segments of culture?language for in? stance still is not fitted in with the rest very satisfactorily?that would be so much additional profit. Moreover, the problem can be attacked both historically and dy- namic-analytically, which is not true of all fields of anthropology. Finally, the subject is essentially interdisciplinary. It was soci? ology that really broke the way, but com? parative and culture history will undoubt- edly be equally interested. CULTURE AND PERSONALITY We have at last a systematic, eclectic, and well-rounded book on culture and person? ality?John Honigmann's 1954 volume of that title. It will make relatively easy the teaching of courses in the field. Just the bibliography of 500 titles will help. It is fine to have available a balanced summary. At the same time, the very fact of the condensation of the total subject matter into the range of a text-book makes evident certain limitations of field which have not yet been transcended, and which obtrude more nakedly than in a collection of forty or fifty papers by specialists such as the basic assemblage by Kluckhohn and Mur- ray. Honigmann defines as he goes along: such as, community versus society, and adaptive survival versus adjustment. But a statement like "Suicide is a means of over- coming perplexing problems and anxieties: it reduces a variety of tensions, but in doing so it also kills the person," manifests a quaint naivete* lacking in the original pas- sage in Kluckhohn and Murray that suicide is more or less explained by having an ad- justive though not an adaptive survival value. Kluckhohn and Murray named their famous anthology Personality In Nature, Society, and Culture. Honigmann begins his book with this sentence: "The student of culture and personality studies what hap- pens to personality by virtue of an indi- vidual's membership in enduring groups whose members follow socially standardized ways of acting, thinking, and feeling." In other words, the subject matter is person? ality in such and such situation. Now if personality fails primarily into some one division of science, it fails into psychology rather than into physiology, anthropology, or sociology. A possible alternative would be to assert that personality does not fall into any one territory but is wholly a cross- roads or transfer point between anthro? pology, psychology, sociology, and possibly still other scientific subjects. However this extreme position has not been outrightly maintained, so far as I know. We return, accordingly, to the definition of "culture and personality" as being the study of the psychological topic of personality not in abstraction but under certain conditions of social and cultural influence. Honigmann goes on: "In the main, how? ever, culture and personality remains largely a pursuit of cultural anthropologists who</page><page sequence="11">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 303 are familiar with psychological methods and principles." This characterization seems fair factually and would presumably be accepted by most of those familiar with the subject. In short, the field is the study of a psycho? logical subject mainly by anthropological specialists more or less familiar with psy- chology. This finding is supported by the ratio of anthropological to psychological authors and titles in Honigmann's bibliog- raphy: 58 to 42, with sociology barely one- third as numerous as anthropology. It is evident from Honigmann's volume that what culture and personality pre-emi- nently yet lacks is a large corpus of coher- ing informational fact. But I do not sense that there exists within the subject much feeling that there is need for such a corpus. Each investigator picks his problem and field independently, hoping to make an experiment or discovery that will be cru- cial. Such a result can indeed sometimes be achieved in a developed science like physics or chemistry or genetics?just because of the coherent body of knowledge and system of interpretation already established. The betting will be that only one of a thousand inquiries will produce anything revolution- ary of Galilean scope; but also that nine hundred of a thousand will produce some? thing?minute, modest, or considerable?that will be of significance just because it ties up with a going system and extends or modi- fies it. Culture and personality studies are being pursued with intensity and devotion, but one feels that they are popping off in diverse and unaccountable directions much like a string of fire-crackers. One inquirer is interested in tensions, another in Ror- schachs, another wants to experiment on frustration; but in effect, each starts off on his own?except when a string of them go in for an exaggerated fad like toilet train? ing. I am certainly not an active participant in the field; but, simply on the basis of experience in related ones, I feel that one might plan an overall attack that would be more effective. Let me suggest. Culture is one component of the culture- and-personality field, and most of what we know of human culture has been organized by classifications on a spatial basis. The characteristics of the native cultures of areas like the American Southwest, Northwest, Plains, and Mexico are well recognized, and it would be a relatively economical and presumably productive procedure to define systematically the corresponding ethoses or modal personalities, from which as a body of systematized findings it would be profitable to take off both to more ex? tended comparisons and to further "test? ing" of principles revealed. In fact, a begin? ning had been made in this very direction by Benedict in her first comparison of Pueblo and Plains as "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" respectively, although by 1934 in Patterns of Culture she had narrowed her approach, in the direction of highlight- ing sharper contrasts, by focusing on the selected single tribes of Zuni and Kwakiutl. However, Devereux (1951) as Honigmann points out, has emphasized a "Plains area ethos" which embodies and historically underlies the ethos of any one Plains tribe. Honigmann himself recognizes that a "rela? tively homogeneous personality" can be discerned throughout the subarctic conif- erous forest belt of native America?in fact the names of Cooper, Landes, and Saindon can be added from his own text to those of Barnouw, Caudill, Hallowell, and him? self whom he cites as contributors to this finding. But why then not match this dis- cernment against that of an ethos of the Plains, or of the agricultural woodland which contains ethnic relatives of the Cree, Chippewa, and Naskapi of the subarctic? Or above all against the ethos of the ad- jacent Eskimo who contrast so vividly to ethnologist and layman? With the perspec? tive derivable from characterizations of two or more such ethoses, it would then be possible to go on to look for definite corre- lations with environment, food supply, population density, settlement pattern. Not that any of these would presumably turn out to be the sole or even the predominant cause of the differing ethoses, but they might well be contributing factors and thus put us in the way of having in hand not only descriptions but reliable partial explanations. While teaching a graduate course at</page><page sequence="12">304 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 Columbia University a few years ago, I compared the ethoses of eight tribes in- habiting a continuous are of more than a thousand miles?Yurok, Yuki, Yokuts, Mo- have, Walapai, Navaho, Zuni, and Arapaho ?for all of which there are adequate ethno? graphic data and with all of which I had had personal contact (least with the Nav? aho). It became evident that an unpro- ductive habitat, which enforced nearly con? stant but scattering food quest, tended strongly to be accompanied by meager and undifferentiated institutions as well as per- sonalities. But where there was a chance of surplus food, or high-value food secured rapidly, institutional life developed, with? out serious setback even in the face of oc- casional famines. Thus the culture achieved a degree of richness and specialization, and with these the representative personality also became specialized as well as, above all, definite. It seems clear that Yurok, Mohave, Zuni, Arapaho personalities are about as differentiated from one another as are the cultures, and that while their "hues" are distinctive, they roughly agree in the measure of their "colorfulness" or saturation as against the drab personality of the poor Walapai scattered over their desert in which they never starved, yet could never forge ahead. All this perhaps was expectable, but it was satisfying to see the personality formulations consistently falling into patterns correlative with the known ethnography and ecology. In fact, my orally presented findings seemed in concord with the famous ones of Benedict, except that I chose my ma? terial for geographical continuity and near- contiguity, whereas she spaced hers widely to attain striking contrast. She was justified in this because twenty years ago it was still important to impress a belated or sluggish world with the fact of variety of patterning of culture and of personality. But that principle is now long established and ac? cepted; the present need is for a steady, step-by-step extension of observations over geographically (or historically) coherent areas. "National Character," by Inkeles and Levinson (1954) is a formal theoretical and methodological review, whose intrinsic im? portance is enhanced by a judicial quality due to the authors being a sociologist and a clinical psychologist. They equate national character with the "structure" of modal personality, and insist that the latter be formulated from psycho? logical study of an adequate sample of per? sons studied individually; which in general has not been the case, its place having been taken by psychological analysis of "collec? tive policies and products" (which appar? ently means sociocultural manifestations). The characterizing features are enduring personality features?high level abstractions of generic dispositions in adults. National character cannot be equated with culture, and must be defined as a determinant rather than a form of behavior. Mead's ap? proach is defined as psychocultural, that is, supported mainly by non-individualized, collective facts of culture; as was Benedict's to an even greater degree. It is evident that national character is here reviewed as a specifically psychological problem. It is therefore dependent on a theory of personality. Such a theory, how? ever, psychology still lacks, except for psy- choanalysis; and psychoanalysis remains selective and partial in its coverage, besides being even today stubbornly resisted among large contingents in psychology. To which I would add that there is no perceptible rush of psychologists to secure studies of representative samples of individuals from a representative number of nations or cultures. Anthropologists of course possess even less personality theory of their own, and have accordingly too often tended to oper- ate with discrete fragments of psychoa? nalysis that were easily broken off from the whole and easily operated with, and at the same time held out hope of large, easy rewards, as long as one assumed that adult character might be largely determined by childhood experiences like swaddling, weaning, and toilet training. On the other side, when anthropologists feel impelled themselves to secure the psychological test samples that they are interested in but psychologists are not getting, they protec-</page><page sequence="13">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 305 tively fall back on techniques specialized enough to look fool-proof. My fundamental criticism would be not that Rorschachs or explanations from swaddling are neces- sarily untrue or wrong, but that at best they can give insights into only limited and free-floating patches of the total area of phenomena. In view of the foregoing, perhaps the best thing we anthropologists can do is to consciously limit our efforts to "psychocul- tural" studies of Mead's type. Not only has she led in initiating these, but she has piled up an impressive mass of observations and formulations on half a dozen cultures? much the largest body of data we possess, sometimes richly evidenced and always per- ceptive. If only she would refrain from pushing on beyond to where we cannot defend her! One constructive suggestion may be in order. LaBarre (1945, 1946) has contrasted Chinese and Japanese character as differing consistently in respective slackness and tension, in spite of one culture being mainly derived from the other and prob? ably the bulk of their content being the same. He also uses other terms like orality and anality, but I pass these over as being explanatory more than descriptive. Now degree of tension is one of a series of polarities which Jakobson and associated modern linguists have recently set up as a frame within which to define the variety of phonemes of human language?the other being duration, volume, tonality, voicing, etc. The possible character axes or "dimen? sions" of course mostly would be quite different for personality than from those of speech, but, for descriptive and organizing purposes, might not a series of them be useful? I think for instance of polar quali? ties like order and organization, or cleanli- ness and finish (both of which might prove to bracket with tension, or again might not); or competition; or retractility; time- mindedness; verbalization; and so forth. This suggestion rests on the assumption that organized, analytic description ordi- narily must precede causal-functional de- termination, and that we have had a pre- mature excess of attempts at the latter in this and related fields of psychic and cul? tural inter-impingement. SOCIAL SCIENCE INFLUENCES Two recent general books by J. S. Slotkin deserve comment, partly because it is not too overtly patent of what they are symp- tomatic. They are Social Anthropology, 1950, and Personality Development, 1952. The latter is an endeavor at a systematic theory of personality development, with emphasis on the social and cultural factors involved. A natural question is why an anthropologist should want to write sys- tematically on personality while there are thousands of psychologists around. A nat? ural answer would be the already discussed statement by Honigmann that in the field of culture and personality one studies what happens to personality viewed societally. The two aims certainly are close together; just as the two authors are of the same age group and presumably similar intellectual bent and antecedents. Slotkin's Social Anthropology is more completely novel in American anthropol? ogy. The subtitle is The Science of Human Society and Culture. It is a remarkable book in the precise definition of its aim, method, and technique, and in the con- sistent rigor with which these are adhered to. It has evoked little reaction from our profession. The one principal review?by an approximate age-mate?handled the book roughly. The private comments I have heard were unsympathetic. Older anthro? pologists have generally ignored it. They are busy with work they have developed for themselves and which the book mostly ignores, so they have reciprocated. Yet any book so thoroughly different as this is from the usual general work on anthropology, and so competently carried out, challenges attention. It may be a sterile deviation, or it may be a fertile seed. As nearly as I can make out, Slotkin is a system-maker and a deductivist. He begins with propositions and he works down from the most general to the more and more par? ticular. Last come the concrete illustra- tions. These are literally only exemplifica-</page><page sequence="14">306 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 tions of general propositions. Therefore they never constitute an extended and coherent body of fact, but are torn out of their context of occurrence so as to widen their illustrative range by contrast. They are selected with much originality for their vividness, and many of them are exceed- ingly interesting, apart from the point they illustrate. But they are always marshalled toward an objective, like ranks of privates that are there to make Gen. Principle win a campaign. To be sure, this was also the method of Boas in many of his "theo? retical" papers and passages. But Boas made particular theoretical points; he never wove a larger theoretical system. This has of late been charged against him as a defect; but it may have been part of his strength. Certainly he himself would have felt that with a wide-embracing, close- knit system he would have impaired his integrity as a scientist. Skotkin evidently believes that the most important thing he has to present is his theoretical system, else he would not protrude it so. His preface says that he is offering "a systematic intro? duction to social anthropology," which hitherto has mainly "developed as an em? pirical and comparative study." The book "includes a systematic body of . . . funda- mental theory concerning the nature and effects of human society and culture." The "propositions" he makes are then "demon? strated" by comparative data. "Concepts are analyzed and defined as rigorously as possible." Here is a sample of the procedure. Chap? ter 9 is on the Esthetic World View as differentiated from the Naturalistic, Super- naturalistic, and Mystical World Views. It begins: "Estheticism is the environmental approach which achieves adjustment by finding situations to which one's responses are themselves satisfying, i.e., are an end in themselves rather than a means." Play is "the esthetic practices of a society which embrace customarily and intrinsically satis? fying behavior"; art, those practices through which society "changes parts of the environ? ment into the kinds of situations which elicit intrinsically satisfying responses." Representational art (condensed from pp. 287-298) "(a) harmonizes the universe . . . (b) socializes the universe . . . (c) acts as a social control ... (d) strengthens group solidarity . . . (e) enriches the observer's perception . . . (f) may provide a certain amount of wish-fulfillment." These cita- tions fairly illustrate the type and frame? work of Slotkin's procedure. It is evident how drastically different this procedure is from that hitherto prevalent in general, theoretical, or text books of anthropology. The aim is a wholly theo? retical system, built up by formal definition and reflection on common knowledge, car- ried through deductively, and with data admitted only as exemplary illustration of general propositions. I do not know how far manuals of physics may have served as a conscious or unconscious model for Slot? kin's presentation. But, if so, it is a mis- application, since, however physics may be represented to the beginning student as a finished product, physics has come into existence through a vast body of highly technical, non-common-sense knowledge; and while it has attained to many rigorous definitions, it did not begin with them. Perhaps Slotkin's motivation is not imita- tion of physics, but is essentially an urge toward dialectic, toward logical construc? tion, and toward conceptual systematizing as such. Let me be clear: I am not attacking Slot? kin's system. So far as I can see it is sound, and I know I could not evolve a better one, nor probably even propose an equally coherent one. I am pointing out how wholly different it is from previous anthro? pological presentations. Since the beginning, anthropologists have been either empirical, working slowly point by point toward generalizations, or they have been particu? larly speculative for particular hypotheses. With Slotkin we are even in a new atmos- phere of language: "environmental," "ap? proach," "achieve," "adjustment," "situa- tions," "responses," "practices," "behavior," "elicit," "satisfying"?it is in such pale-gray, depersonalized words that the findings are deliberately clothed. Life and color remain only in the quoted excerpts which humbly</page><page sequence="15">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 307 serve to validate the propositions that make the system. What is it that we have here? Has Slotkin made the first stab at presenting anthro? pology in more scientific form than the rest of us? Or has an obsessive urge toward sys? tem at all cost driven him to manufacture a largely verbal one before anthropological knowledge and thinking are ready for thor- ough abstract systematization? I will not presume to give the answer since I am aware of partiality for the concrete and pluralistic tradition which I have grown up in and love. But the question is im? portant and not to be dismissed too off- handedly. Quite likely both kinds of answer are partly true. The future will tell. But what we can see fairly clearly now, as of 1954, is a trend of which Slotkin's book is symptomatic. This trend I shall now try to analyze and characterize. Essentially it means the entry into an? thropology of an overtly "social science" orientation. This entry was imperceptibly gradual at first, and thus is difficult to date exactly; but its influence is recognizable in the rise of acculturation as a subject of interest, of culture and personality, of ap? plied anthropology. Slotkin is trying to organize a formal anthropological theory corresponding to economic, sociological, and psychological formal theory. The older anthropology saw some broad problems and made generalizations?Tylor alone would establish that. But it contained also a strong sensory, aesthetic, and experiential interest. It liked artifacts and it established mu? seums; it was interested in the land and scenes in which peoples functioned; it liked to experience?at first vicariously and then in the flesh?how these peoples looked and behaved and what they had to say. It was part natural history in character, part hu- manities; but the humanities-like ingredi- ent was non-normative, comparative, and broad-ranging instead of intensely particu- laristic, and therefore somewhat more prone than most humanists were to generalize, though its generalizations mostly remained fairly humble, step-by-step, "low-level." Anthropology was often respected in its early days, but it was also a "queer" pursuit mainly of odd things. It was only slowly introduced into mass education, and the colleges had difficulty fitting it into a cur- ricular compartment. They finally settled pretty generally on classing it as a social science; almost inevitably so where sociol? ogy was already well established with the collegiate public, so that it was administra- tively convenient to add anthropology as an annex. Being easily the most pictur- esque, concrete, and least formalized of the social sciences, anthropology exercised an appeal on many social science students, and some of these even came over into it. But they usually came with social science antecedents and interests in place of the natural history or humanistic ones that had been customary among the earlier anthropologists. The enforced association with sociologists over most the central area of the United States further accustomed both anthropo? logical teachers and students to an imper- sonal, non-face-to-face approach, to dealing with familiar rather than remote or unusual experience, to formalism and order, to defi? nition, to seeking abstractness as an end in itself, to worrying about quantification and its validation, to being "socially conscious." Psychology, starting just as far from social science as had we, escaped from philosophy to throw itself into experimental science, then underwent the shock of Freudianism, and entered the social science fold at least half willingly. There, reciprocal influence with anthropology seems to have been what largely generated culture and personality as a subject. In short, a considerable part of the present-day population of American an? thropologists has antecedents and generic orientation pretty drastically different from the remainder as well as from the whole anthropological population of thirty or forty years ago. Slotkin's book expresses in the most extreme form the attitudes and interests of the growing minority. It is also no mere accident of idiosyncracy that his second book, on personality develop? ment, is essentially outright psychology. Nor is it accident that Honigmann's book is basically about what happens to per-</page><page sequence="16">308 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 sonality under culture, and that even its style and manner?the formal abstractness, muting of vividness, and the rest?are simi? lar even though perhaps less extreme than in Slotkin. With two intellectual ancestries and motivations now represented among an? thropologists, we are de facto having two streams of thought flowing. This is per? haps the major development in anthropo? logical thought of the past generation, and it seems to me by now to be incontrovertible. What lies ahead? Prediction in matters like this is uncertain, and in a sense sterile, even if the future happens to vindicate it. It is more important to realize to the full what the forces at work are and how they are impinging. If thus we push our exami? nation farther, it becomes evident that the several strains in the older, natural history- humanistic kind of anthropology, diverse as they are?biological, prehistoric, ethno? graphic and culture-historical, archeologi? cal, and linguistic?are not falling apart under social science impact. In spite of their growing specialization, they seem as much determined as ever to stick together. That means that if there is a split, the secession is likely to be of the social science or "behavioral" group?social, personality, acculturation, and applied anthropology? from the remainder. And at that I am more doubtful that such a budding off will take place. The vast majority of anthropologists whose compelling interests lie on that side would apparently be grievously distressed over a split. I do not believe that Slotkin and Honigmann are even dreaming of leading a secession. Any strains that arise therefore bid fair to be not professional, but intellectual. We have indeed an actual case to ob- serve?the formation of Social Relations at Harvard University in 1946 by the with- drawal of Social Anthropology and Social and "Clinical" (read Personality) Psychol? ogy from their old departments and their union with Sociology. This was a step very difficult for other universities with lesser resources to follow; and it has not been followed, in spite of the many existing sociology-anthropology departments that superficially look as if they already con? stituted half the makings of a Social Rela? tions group. The straight, or old-fashioned, anthropology department at Harvard has not suffered, but has flourished and grown. The anthropologists in social relations have none of them renounced their professional affiliation; in fact, except for some shuttling back and forth of courses and students, they seem to stand much where they would have stood if there had been no new com? bination department?except that there are more of them. And intellectually the great? est increment due to social anthropology within Social Relations has been the Values Study?a project that would have been difficult of initiation by an anthropological department that was founded on and around a museum. So the net record to anthropology to date is some definite gains and no loss. The influence of the Harvard example on other universities is not reflected in the departmental organization of these uni? versities but in their "general education" teaching. Since such teaching is intended normally to be terminal in its subject, and comes at the lower undergraduate level, it may affect the thinking of the students reached but will not ordinarily affect the thinking done in connection with anthro? pological research. The foregoing applies to the United States. It does not hold for Britain, where social anthropology is in a way dominant, because sociology is so little developed in Britain that anthropology has to care for its interests also and is therefore pulled more to the social side. And on the con? tinent of Europe there is of course nothing corresponding to American anthropology: prehistory, ethnology, and (physical) an? thropology have different roots and affilia- tions, remain and mostly want to remain distinct, and linguistics feels itself wholly and only a humanity. This European dis- junctive separatism is undoubtedly causing the European streams of thought in what we call anthropology to flow quite dif- ferently from ours. But it would be rash to predict what the outcome of the differ? ence will be.</page><page sequence="17">History of Anthropological Thought?Kroeber 309 How about an ultimate reintegration of the social anthropological group of inter? ests with the other and longer established ones? I do not expect that if there is such a reintegration it can be at all near at hand. It is in the unconscious or subconscious bents that the differences largely originate, and it takes time to reach these. The so- cially conscious are in the nature of things radar or other-directed; old line anthro? pologists are notoriously inner-directed, and they like to experience directly, not vicariously. They also like to observe, and have trained themselves to observe; the social science type, to be articulate. There will be rapprochements, but we must not expect these to come fast. Nor should they be one-sided. Perhaps we of the older an? thropological tradition can begin, or here and there have already begun, to learn from our social scientist colleagues greater precision in formulation, the need not to let the fondling of information delay gen? eralization unduly long, and such like vir? tues in which we have not always shone.
