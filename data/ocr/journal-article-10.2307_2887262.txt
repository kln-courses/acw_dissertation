Pp. x, 452. $49.50. Jewish mysticism, as Elliot Wolfson points out in this learned and richly documented vol- ume, is best understood as a religious orientation that has expressed itself in distinctive ways in different periods of Jewish history. Certain motifs and images, however, recur in the diverse literary texts that document the Jewish mystical experience, and tracing the ways in which one particular theme is represented can transform perceptions of the tra- dition as a whole. Wolfson's study sets out to reconfigure understandings of medieval Jew- ish mysticism by exploring the nature of visionary experiences of God in mystical trends of various times and places.</page><page sequence="2">630 Reviews Wolfson's exploration of envisionings of the divine places special emphasis on the phe- nomenological component of Jewish mysticism. Disputing Gershom Scholem's judgment that Jewish mysticism is first and foremost an intellectual discipline intended to provide the mystic with knowledge of the divine and its relationship to humanity and the world, Wolfson argues that the primary emphasis of medieval Jewish mysticism was on experience and praxis. For the mystic the imagination supplanted intellect as the divine element in the human soul, and it was through the imagination that the mystic visualized aspects of the divine and attained a state of prophecy or ecstatic ascent to the higher realms of being. Moreover, by locating the anthropomorphized shape of God within the imagination, the mystic reconciled the conflict between corporeal and spiritual understandings of God; since the corporeal figuration of the divine was only within the imagination, it was symbolic and did not have to be taken either literally or metaphorically. Wolfson asserts, as well, that a distinctive aspect of these visionary traditions is their phallocentrism, since the object of mystical vision is the male deity and more specifically the divine phallus. Thus, seeing God is both intensely eroticized and androcentric in Jewish mystical texts, which always depict a male mystic's glimpses of the male deity. Wolfson writes that even in texts that speak of God as male and female, the female Shekhinah is understood as a reintegrated part of the male phallus. In medieval Jewish mystical writing, he suggests, heterosexuality is transformed by kabbalistic symbolism into a homoeroticism that places the phallus at the center of the visual encounter and in which not only the object seen but the eye itself corresponds to or substitutes for the penis. Thus, he argues, in some sense the mystical vision parallels the rite of circumcision: from the sign of the covenant engraved on the penis the mystic can imaginatively visualize the divine phallus. While the main focus of Wolfson's book is on visions of the divine in mystical texts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he begins with an analysis of envisionings of God in biblical, apocalyptic, and rabbinic sources, demonstrating that the Hebrew Bible itself con- tains contradictory data, including passages such as Isa. 6 in which visions of an anthro- pomorphized enthroned God are granted to the prophet, as well as those such as Deutero- Isaiah which vehemently deny that God could ever be envisioned in corporeal form (Isa. 40.18). Wolfson suggests that it is precisely because both opposed points of view inhabit the same sacred text that the history of Jewish attitudes toward the visual imaging of God unfolded in the dialectical way it did. In his third chapter Wolfson discusses visions of God in the earliest extant forms of Jewish mystical writing, the merkavah (chariot) or hekhalot (palaces) literature, which depict journeys through seven heavenly palaces or halls to reach either the throne of God's glory or the divine chariot. Such difficult to date and locate texts as the Shi'ur Komah and the Ma'aseh Merkavah present visions of an enthroned God that are strongly indebted to the prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah. As Wolfson notes, these texts epitomize the paradox of professing the visibility of the essentially invisible God. He also points out the implicit eroticism that these texts associate with the moment of envisioning the enthroned deity, suggesting that the image of the divine glory sitting on a throne becomes a metaphor for the sacred union of the masculine and feminine aspects of the divine. In his discussion of the Hasidei Ashkenaz, Jewish pietists in twelfth- and early-thirteenth- century Germany whose writings strongly influenced slightly later Jewish mystics in Pro- vence and Spain, Wolfson demonstrates that their theosophical understanding of the divine involved an ecstatic visionary component. The Hasidei Ashkenaz envisioned the divine as luminous and the process of knowing divine power as illumination. Their mystical traditions had a strongly experiential aspect, involving the use of holy names to invoke prophetic and visionary experiences, both to conjure images of angels and to attain a vision of the divine glory. Indeed, in subsequent chapters Wolfson notes that the use of light and light symbolism to depict the nature of the divine was central in various circles of kabbal-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 631 istic speculation in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in northern France, Provence, Spain, and Germany. Moreover, light played a dual role, both as emblematic of the ultimate nature of being and as paradigmatic of the mystical experience of illumination. In "Visionary Gnosis and the Role of the Imagination in Theosophic Kabbalah" Wolfson continues the theme that to know God as light is to be mystically illuminated, pointing out that in one etymology the kabbalistic term for the divine emanations, the sefirot, is derived from "sapphire," conveying an impression of luminosity. In this theosophic scheme, the tenth sefira, the Shekhinah, designated as feminine, is described as "the speculum that does not shine," since the passive and receptive Shekhinah is said to reflect the luminous but invisible divine forms above. Again, the nuances are erotic, since as Wolfson writes, "The concealed phallus, the ultimate and obsessional object of the mystic's gaze, is specularized through the speculum that resists representational form, as it has nothing of its own. But lacking all form-indeed constituting the very essence of lack and negativity-allows the feminine to disclose the form of the hidden glory.... The eye can contemplate the interior image, the speculum that shines, only through the external sheath, the speculum that does not shine" (pp. 274-75). In his discussion of revelation and interpretation in the Zohar, the central medieval Jew- ish mystical text, compiled in northern Spain in the late thirteenth century, Wolfson suggests that for the Zohar the Torah becomes the anthropomorphic embodiment of God visualized in the imagination. Thus the imaging of a formless God in iconic forms is related to the hermeneutical act of reading the sacred text of the Torah. This correspondence between the revealed word and its divine source provides the conceptual background for the mystical praxis of seeing God in the text. In this way the Zohar portrays the process of exegesis as both prophetic and also as intensely erotic since the exegete stands in the position of the phallic Yesod (the sefira or emanation of "foundation") and the Torah corresponds to the feminine Shekhinah. The exegete must penetrate beneath the surface of the text in order to visually contemplate the divine phallus, the source of secret knowledge. Here, Wolfson argues, the Zohar brings analysis of the symbolic imagination full circle-from the human body to God and from God back to the human body. In Wolfson's view, it is this identifi- cation of textual exegesis with erotic visionary experience that explains the extraordinary power the Zohar had in subsequent generations of Jewish history as it, in turn, became a hermeneutical basis for revelatory experience. Through a Speculumn That Shines is an important and provocative contribution to the study of Jewish mysticism by one of the major scholars now working in this field. Its insights and contributions, however, extend beyond the purviews of the Jewish experience and are of significance and value to all students of medieval intellectual and religious history.
