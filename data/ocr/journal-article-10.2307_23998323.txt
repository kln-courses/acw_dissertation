<plain_text><page sequence="1">« CHOSISME » A SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION So much of what our forebears believed to be true was found out to be false by us. And thereupon we are left with a feeling of great emptiness. That emptiness is the true reason for our sadness. Abbé G Ali an i (1778). I. Introduction M y initial interest in the new novel in France, and particularly in the literary movement generally known as "chosisme", was stimulated by my studies of the cultural background of perception (1). My curi osity in this kind of investigation was aroused by a series of remarks made, among others, by Lucien Febvre regarding the relationship between the growth of modern science and the predominance of visual elements in the perceptual field of modern man (2). Following Febvre's manner of approach I set out to assess the composition of the perceptual world in some representative examples of contemporary fiction. From what I previously knew about this fiction, Kafka and the "chosistes" appeared to me particularly relevant. The reader can easily guess that my curiosity was fully satisfied ; the perceptual world of Kafka's and that of Robbe-Grillet's novels is overwhelmingly visual. It is hoped that some causes of this phenomenon will become apparent in the course of this study. A second remark which I should like to make by way of introduction refers to my personal relation, as a reader, to the fictional works of Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute and Michel Butor who are com monly considered as the most outstanding representatives of the "chos iste" movement. Though these works made an immediate and often captivating appeal to me I have to admit that I was seldom able to achieve an aesthetic relation with them, i.e., a relation which elicits such a degree of self-involvement that the novel ceases to be an object of attention—a book about something—and becomes self-realising experience. The process of reading took invariably the following course : it started off by an outburst of free floating imagination and ended up in a detached and reflexive attitude. This does on no account mean that I liked or enjoyed the novel less and less as I progressed with my reading. It is only that my relation to it evolved in a specific (1) Zevedei Barbu, Problems of Historical Psychology (London, i960). (2) Lucien Febvre, Le problème de l'in croyance au XVIe siècle. La religion de Rabelais (Paris, 1947). 127 Archiv, europ. socioL, IV (1963), 127-147.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES CRITIQUES direction : as the initial imaginative and emotional stage was dying out I became more and more aware of, and intellectually concerned with specific problems, technical, psychological, sociological and metaphysical. Admittedly, my approach to the "chosiste" fiction was not the typical one in the sense that I had a scientific problem in mind. But this does not necessarily imply that the type of reading outlined above is confined to myself. On the contrary, I am under the impression that this type of reading is determined by a constitutive trait of the new novel in France—and of contemporary novel in general—which can be defined as an almost total absence of a direct and naive relation with life. Even a conservative like Thomas Mann realises that the novelist can no longer be guided only by imagination and personal insight ; he needs also systematic knowledge of human life. There is, of course, nothing ab solutely new in such an opinion. What is new and what the new novel demonstrates in an extreme, is the fact that throughout his work the novelist is highly conscious of his own mode of understanding human life, and that the technique of writing is as much a datum of his con sciousness as the contents of his writing are. Speaking about the specific character of a novelist's activity, Michel Butor concludes with a quasi-scientific image : "Le roman est le laboratoire du récit" (3). In a similar context Robbe-Grillet uses the term "fabrication". Special attention should be paid to the fact that both contexts suggest that the novelist "experiments" on, or "manufactures" not only the method, but also the substance of his narrative. In other words, he assumes the task of discovering and creating modes of existing symptomatic of the human condition in the contemporary world. This experimentalist and manufacturing attitude is conveyed to the reader in more than one way. To start with, his awareness of the author's technique of writing is such that it becomes a "problem" which he examines and re-examines throughout the process of reading. In fact this is a component part of his relation with, and participation in the world of the novel. And this is only the beginning. While the thread of the narrative recedes into an obscure mental background, his con scious activity is punctuated by a series of questions regarding the nature of human perception and memory, the organization of human experience, the structure of personality... All this leads gradually to the more general and abstract problem of man's relation to himself and to his cosmos, social and physical. I am not prepared to discuss at this early stage the question whether this kind of effect on the reader constitutes a specific trait of the new novel, or whether it indicates a new stage in the development of the modern novel in general. For the moment, I would like only to record the fact that the new novel creates such an effect in a more deliberate (3) Michel Butor, Répertoire (Paris, i960). 128</page><page sequence="3">CHOSISME and intentional manner than the traditional novel. This, of course, says nothing about its intrinsic literary value, but it does say a great deal about its sociological and psychological relevance. Throughout my contact with this novel, I had the compelling feeling that I was confronted with a "problem" in the sense given to this term by Max Weber, namely, with a cultural phenomenon highly significant for contemporary life, individual and social. As such it deserves to form the basis for a structural analysis of contemporary civilization. The last introductory remark is of a more methodological nature. The present study is focused on the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet, the reference to other "chosistes" being indirect and of a subsidiary nature. The reasons for this are only too obvious : Robbe-Grillet is by far the most consistent and the most characteristic of the whole movement. He is also the most explicit not only in his fictional writing, but also in his critical and philosophical essays where he has coined the formula of what one may call the ideal type of the new novel. This formula has often been used as a target of attack against himself, and against other "chosistes" on the ground that their novels do not live up to their idea of the novel, and consequently, they do not do what they claim to do. This kind of criticism is, however, slightly spurious and premature. The fact that the fictional works of the "chosistes" conform only partly to the conceptual pattern of the new novel is by no means unique ; the history of most literary movements demonstrates a similar lag between intention and realization, between vision and action. To this one should add the fact that "chosisme" is still growing and groping its way. This makes it all the more necessary for the writers belonging to this movement to clarify their goals and reinforce their basic faith by construing an ideal model. My impression is that in this particular case, the reader has also to resort to a similar method in order to organise his understanding, and intensify his enjoyment. That is why it would be advisable to proceed, at this early stage, with a brief description of the ideal type of the new novel. 2. The catabasic epic. Robbe-Grillet has a new concept of the narrative—a new vision of the "novelesque", as he sometimes puts it—which he articulates under various forms in his writings. Whether he proceeded from this or has arrived at it by interpreting his own novels is for the moment irrelevant. It is enough to say that such a vision is to a great extent accessible to any one who is prepared to reflect upon the condition of the narrative in the present-day world. It is on account of its close relation with contemporaneity, social and cultural, that Robbe-Grillet emphasises so strongly the difference between the new novel and the traditional 129</page><page sequence="4">NOTES CRITIQUES novel which he describes in terms of classical realism represented by Constant, Balzac, Stendhal, Flaubert, to mention only the most typical ones. Moreover, he emphasises the fact that the new novel has devel oped as a reaction against the past, and as such defines itself in opposi tion to the traditional novel. While the traditional novel is both a hero- and a plot-centred fiction the new novel tends to be neither. The first and the main concern of the traditional novelist is to get in order the identity papers of the hero, this being the principal device by which he creates the illusion of reality in terms of every-day life. Thus, his hero is a well-drawn character with an easily recognisable face and body, with well established habits, virtues and vices, with a definite social status... On the whole, the hero should have a well articulated mental structure which implies a motivational consistency. This con stitutes the foundation for the second essential trait, the plot, which is a type of action of a more or less complex nature springing from the hero's character, and unfolding itself in progressive unilinear time ; the plot is in fact the unfolding of the hero's life. In more general terms, such a novel, or rather such a concept of the novel presupposes an anthropocentric individualistic vision of life. The hero—normally an inflated individual character-—constitutes a motivational and inten tional centre around which the world of the novel, i.e., the world in miniature organises itself. The hero is a project of existence and the world is there to serve his purpose. Cervantes has set the pace in this direction in a grand style. It is this anthropocentric character of the traditionalist novel that sets out by reaction a specific development in contemporary fiction which leads gradually to the disintegration of the hero in the novel. The novel of the stream of consciousness marks the first stage in this development. The conventional papers of identity become poorer and poorer and less and less relevant. A recognisable face, a name, a social status are details which say little, if anything about the character of the hero and the nature of the plot. The focus of the narrative is on the inner life of the hero, therefore, on an aspect of human ex istence with such a high degree of fluidity that it can hardly be pinned down in terms of conventional characterology. This does not neces sarily mean that the heroes of Proust, of James Joyce, or of Virginia Woolf are not integrated characters. It is only that their integration, and indeed their uniqueness depends on some inner factors which seldom reveal themselves entirely. That is why their action seems to be, at least partly, autonomous and even inexplicable in terms of conventional psychology. This sets out an important change in the structure of modern novels, in the sense that the emphasis on the hero as the key to the plot becomes weaker and weaker. We are much more interested in what Bloom does than in what sort of character he has. Kafka and Musil—to mention only two characteristic names—take another definite step in the same direction. The hero of their novels 130</page><page sequence="5">CHOSISME is a "man without qualities", even without a name ; he is pure in wardness. The hard core of the hero's character is reduced to an assumed centre of psychic energy which projects itself in symbolic forms above, beyond and beside the moulds of everyday existence. At the same time, the plot becomes improbable, dreamlike and fantastic. Thus, the pretence to serve verisimilitude, the guiding star of the modern novel, loses its meaning. This is the position in the modern novel which the "chosistes" have inherited, and, at the same time, have developed and superseded. To understand this complex relation with the past it is necessary to consider briefly the position occupied within the movement by two of its main representatives, Nathalie Sarraute and Alain Robbe-Grillet. Nathalie Sarraute's novels constitute an attempt to revise the tradi tional conception of verisimilitude and reality. From her point of view the representatives of classical realism can be described as formalists. They populated the world with exceptional characters who act according to well defined beliefs and ideas. These characters are, however, empty formulae, myths in which nobody ever believed. No wonder, therefore, that the hero of contemporary novels has started to drop one by one his self-identifying qualities, his face, his name, his status, his beliefs and ideals. All this constitutes the surface of life and if the novelist still maintains his claim to portray reality he has to go beyond this surface into the depth of human existence. This is what Nathalie Sarraute tries to do. She focuses the narrative on to the inner, primitive and inarticulate aspect of human existence consisting of fluctuating desires, impulses, fears, hopes... These pul sations of human existence knock permanently at the door of the individual's consciousness, but they are never strong enough to engage him totally to a specific mode of being, never persistent and coherent enough to generate a project of life. Thus, Sarraute portrays people who refuse to commit themselves, i.e., to be somebody or something for themselves, or for others. As the title of her novel Le Portrait d'un inconnu suggests, the supreme aim of her art is to un-do the characters, to strip off their qualities and to portray them in their undifferentiated interiority. In the specific sense she creates anti novels and portrays anti-heroes. Though welcoming her criticism of the traditional novel, Robbe Grillet accuses Nathalie Sarraute of not having gone far enough in her conception of the new novel. More precisely, he accuses her of psychologism with a difference, namely, she prefers the language of depth psychology to that of rational psychology prevailing in the traditional novel. Consequently Sarraute's novel is still hero-centred in the manner in which Kafka's novel is, that is, the hero as pure interiority still constitutes a permanent point of reference for the plot. At this point Robbe-Grillet operates a radical change in the structure of the novel. He destroys the hero even in his interiority : he 131</page><page sequence="6">NOTES CRITIQUES destroys the hero as a project and replaces him with a blank sheet, as he prefers to express himself. This implies that the narrative and the plot—if there is any—are no longer inwardly orientated. On the contrary, they appear to be determined by the objects of the external world. In this manner, the novel becomes objective literature. This Copernican revolution in modern fiction has a particular sociological and psychological relevance. But before going into this, it is necessary to illustrate the idea by examples taken from Robbe-Grillet's novels. The reversal of the power relation between the hero, as a human being, and the external world can be considered as the main structural trait of Robbe-Grillet's novels. By an inner dialectic, these novels lead to a systematic degradation of the ontologie status of the hero, and to a systematic rise in the ontologie status of. the external world. If some heroes have a social or professional status, such as "detective", "salesman", "soldier", this has a generic impersonal rather than a characterological significance, and as such, has indirect bearings on the narrative. In order to make this point the author resorts to a great variety of devices : the "detective" is inexperienced and naive, therefore he is not integrated with his professional status ; the "salesman" has no practical sense so that the narrative turns out in the end to be anything but a project of selling wrist watches ; the "soldier" wears somebody else's uniform. In L'Année dernière à Marienbad, we are not told, and remain in doubt to the very end whether M. is the husband of A, or not. Most heroes do not bear a name, their presence being indicated by a letter, or by a generic word, such as "the child", "the woman", "the soldier". The few proper names which are used, such as Wallace, Frank, Mathias, do not stick well to the persons appearing on the whole highly symbolical and even inter-changeable. Even more subtle techniques are used in order to destroy the interi ority of the hero, that ghost in the machine so essential in the making of classical novel. Since this idea will be taken up at a later stage, it suffices, for the moment, to mention only a few suggestive points. First of all, the heroes of Robbe-Grillet, and to a certain extent of the "chosiste" novel in general, are anything but outstanding characters. They are in fact weak personalities, failures, or near-failures, such as salesmen on the verge of bankruptcy like Mathias in Le Voyeur, impotent husbands, like the Narrator in La Jalousie, maladjusted pathological cases, like "the soldier" in Dans le Labyrinthe, who was present at the great battle of Reisenfels, but "did not fight". Secondly, the heroes have no time perspective. If they have a past this either cannot be remembered—the case of A. in L'Année dernière à Marienbad—or is completely re-enacted, and as such becomes sheer present. In either case the personality of the hero is deprived of the feeling of continuity and depth. The same happens with the future which is either reduced to the "next" step in a continuous action, or actually lived as present. Mathias lives through his action of selling watches long before this 132</page><page sequence="7">CHOSISME actually happens. "Last Year in Marienbad" could easily be "Next Year in Marienbad". This is by far the most efficient means by which Robbe-Grillet, and the "chosistes" in general, destroy the hero as a "project". Without the background of the past, and without the perspective of the future, the inner life of the hero loses its continuity and depth, and finally, time itself loses its progressive unilinear character. The existence of the hero is reduced to its concrete situational dimension ; the situation takes hold of the hero and decides his modes of being. Thus, he is what he does, or what he says in a specific situation of the narrative, or rather what he is made to do or to say. How does the new novel produce this displacement of the centre of human existence? By dehumanising the world, or by destroying the pathetic fallacy, says Robbe-Grillet, in one of his philosophical effusions. It would be advisable, however, to leave, at least for the moment, the realm of abstraction and to try to derive the meaning of his statements from what he actually does in his novels. De-humanising means in the first place, de-emotionalising. For this purpose Robbe-Grillet attempts to represent man's relationship with the external world in visual terms, the eye being commonly con sidered as the most intellectualised sense organ. Moreover, he stresses the abstract formal qualities of visual perception, such as, direction, distance, measurement, shape... The cumulative effect of this procedure can be seen under two aspects : first, it creates the impression that the characters are reduced to a pair of mirroring eyes. This may be true, but one has to specify that the eyes are mirrors all round, consequently, the inner life of the characters can be portrayed by a minute description of what they see. In other words, Robbe-Grillet's aim is to visualise, i.e., to freeze, to solidify and geometrize the inner world of his characters. The de-humanising effects of this are only too obvious. The hero's behaviour has no inner dimension ; he moves, makes errors like a rat in a maze ; his mind is mainly spatial. "In the Labyrinth" epitomises this trend of Robbe-Grillet's novel. No less remarkable are the effects which this predominantly visual ised perception has upon the existence of the external world. The insistence on the formal abstract qualities of perception reduces the cathectic process to a minimum, with the result that the objects are deprived of their emotional significance, and indeed, of any meaning derived from their being previously thought, used, or possessed. This restores them their primary intrinsic significance of pure presence ; the objects are there..., opaque and obstinate. The description of the de-humanised world should stop at this point, for any additional word increases the risk, and perhaps the temptation to fall into the pathetic fallacy, and refer to this world as cold, un familiar, strange, uncanny. In order to minimise [this temptation—it can never be completely avoided—one has to bear in mind that the world of Robbe-Grillet's novels is predominantly visual, that his char 133</page><page sequence="8">NOTES CRITIQUES acters busy themselves most of the time with seeing, and even minutely assessing distances, directions, angles, shapes. If the objects possess other qualities apart from the visual ones these are conative rather than affective. Their presence, negative or positive, their order, or disorder make the characters move, think, act and be. Often one has the im pression that the characters are pulled by their eyes and that this sets the pattern of the narrative. Space is there to be walked through, to be covered and measured. The circular space of an island, or of the streets in a town, the open space of the roving eye, the uniform labyrinthic space are all inexhaustible challenges. So is the chrono logical time which has to be accounted for, measured backwards and forwards, minute by minute. Despite Robbe-Grillet's often voiced hostility to any form of psychol ogism the above phenomena cannot be properly understood unless translated in subjective terms. It seems that the engulfing effect of space and time, and the dynamics of any concrete situation set the characters on a desperate search for self-identification. All charac ters run after themselves, and sometimes catch up with themselves. At the beginning of Les Gommes, Wallace is in fact nobody, that is, a provincial inexperienced detective appointed to discover a crime which did not take place. Then gradually he is caught up in the intrinsic dynamics of the situation : the streets of the town with their dark corners, the café with its gossip, with people going and coming. All this absorbs Wallace deeper and deeper, faster and faster until a crime is being committed by Wallace himself, who merely acts according to the pointers in the situation. At the end of the maze of the narrative, Wallace is somebody, namely, a criminal. On the native island of Mathias —the hero of Le Voyeur—space and time give the impression of total presence : he has known the small island since he was born. In his last effort to escape ruin he covers the island house by house trading wrist watches. While he is there, the body of a young girl is found in the sea. Who is the criminal? The answer of the narrative is : a constellation of space and time factors, i.e., some cigarette ends, a piece of string, sweet wrappers, and a gap in the flow of time. At the end of his carefully planned and minutely described race around the island, Mathias cannot account to himself for a certain interval of space and time. Consequently, in an act of self-discovery, he puts together the cigarette ends which happen to be of the same brand he usually smokes, the piece of string—he used to have a similar one in his pocket—the wrappers... A final impression emerges inevitably : there is a crime and a criminal because of this specific space-and-time constellation. The main character of the narrative, about whom we know little more than what we know about his bicycle, cannot tell us anything. He becomes what he is, i.e., a criminal, in the dynamics of the situation. The crime makes the criminal. In La Jalousie, the dynamics of the situation is less manifest because 134</page><page sequence="9">CHOSISME the novel—though a remarkable work of fiction—abounds with such impurities from a "chosiste" point of view that a psychological in terpretation becomes almost inevitable. Despite this, the framework of the narrative points in the same direction. The Narrator is not introduced in the narrative as a character (the jealous husband) con stituted in advance. In fact he is described as a "meticulous absence", as two vigilant eyes recording things and events. Jealousy is not the state of mind of a character, but rather the outcome of a complex topo graphical situation : a large plantation in Africa ; the house ; A. (the wife) ; Frank (a neighbour) ; the main road to the harbour ; hotels, two glasses of whisky, letters, hair combing, two conspicuous stains, of a squashed mirriapode on the wall and of petrol in the courtyard. There must be jealousy. In Dans le Labyrinthe, the idea of the new novel reaches its high est degree of concreteness. Imagine a screen showing either separately, or in subtle confusion two landscapes : the inner landscape of a room, infinite in its details, and the external landscape of empty town streets, infinite in its openness and monotony ; then, suddenly, a flash projecting against this background the figure of a man dressed in military uniform. The vision occurs more and more frequently, lasting longer and longer until the "soldier" comes into being. However, he never differentiates himself completely from his background, for he can easily be confounded with other soldiers, past or present, and even with the picture of a soldier hanging on a wall, in the room. From time to time, he vanishes altogether like a particle in an electro-magnetic field. This transitory state between psychological definiteness and indefiniteness, between existence and non-existence is further stressed by recurrent reference to the painting in the room, the suggestion being that the character and the narrative could be an animated picture. Thus, the main character in the novel is a pure "generality", a complete anti-project. He is a soldier belonging to a defeated and dis banding army, he wears a uniform and matriculation number which are not his own. He has come to this part of the town to deliver a message —a small box which he carries under his arm—to someone whose name and address he does not remember. This is, perhaps, because he is tired, so tired and weak that his mental life is reduced to immediate perceptions. He wanders through streets without name, empty identical streets with identical houses and doors, looking for an address he does not remember. The only guidance and the only stimulus for his search —and for the narrative as a whole— is the sameness of the streets, of the doors and windows, the morbid fascination of the lamp-posts, some vague footsteps on fresh snow, a wandering child, all this appearing in a completely de-egotised field. As he walks, the world of objects comes to, and into him giving him direction and content. Thus, he is driven to complete exhaustion and death. The end of the narrative. At this stage, one can renew the attempt to define the position of 135</page><page sequence="10">NOTES CRITIQUES the new novel in terms of the concepts, project and anti-project. In the classical novel, which is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as "a fiction of prose narrative [...] portraying characters and actions represent ative of real life in continuous plot", the character is a more or less en during structure of mental and physical traits logically and convention ally necessary for the fulfilment of a certain type of action, of certain rôles, of certain values. His mode of being is essentially cathectic ; he throws his mind out investing the world with meanings, and orga nising it to the degree of transforming it into a means for his interests, feelings and will. In this sense the character is a project, and the vision of human life revealed by him is anabasic, i.e., a world invaded by man. This conceptual scheme can, at least partly, be applied to some later developments in the contemporary novel, normally referred to as the psychological novel. In Kafka, for instance, the character is still a project in the specific sense that his mode of being is still es sentially cathectic. However, the manner in which the character organises, appropriates and, in a word, humanises the world is neither logical, nor conventional. The cathectic process is predominantly emotional with the result that the world becomes little else than a reification of feelings and phantasies. On his own feelings of inferi ority and guilt J. K. builds up a "Castle" and a "Trial", both analogies of the world. In this respect, the "chosiste" novel stands in opposition both to the classical and the psychological novel. The characters of this novel are anti-projects and anti-heroes. As the cathectic process is at its lowest ebb their mode of being takes a catabasic turning ; the external reality comes nearer and nearer until the character's existence is sub merged in its thingness. 3. The mental structure of the blank hero. Much of the confusion and opposition aroused by "chosiste" fiction is caused by its resistance to any kind of contextual analysis. What does it mean in psychological and sociological terms? What does it tell me as a person living in this particular historical context? The answer to such questions is not easy, particularly when one takes into account Robbe-Grillet's desperate struggle against psychologism. Little does he know that no psychology is still a psychology. However, these inherent difficulties are not as great as to make a psycho-socio logical interpretation impossible or futile. One has only to bear in mind that there is room for more than one interpretation, and that arbitrariness is unavoidable. According to a first impression one is inclined to say that the 136</page><page sequence="11">CHOSISME "chosiste" novel presents us with a behaviourist picture of the human mind. Sometimes this impression is so vivid that one is reminded of Becherev's "objective psychology". Responsible for this is the object centred character of the narrative revealing a structure of the mind which looks like a conglomerate of responses to external stimuli. The environment itself appears as a system, and not a very coherent one, of reaction releasers. As previously mentioned, the image of the soldier in the empty streets suggests in some important ways that of the rat in the maze. His mind is glued to and manipulated by an oncoming field of visual objects. Alain Resnais caught undoubtedly this aspect of "chos isme" when he made the characters in "Last Year in Marienbad" move like puppets on strings. However, one cannot altogether maintain that the "chosist" fiction presupposes a behaviourist picture of the mind. One thing in particular makes such an interpretation difficult. It is the part played in the "chosiste" novels by privileged objects, such as, "rubbers", in Les Gommes, the piece of string, in Le Voyeur, the stains, in La Jalousie, the parcel, in Dans le Labyrinthe, to mention only the most important ones. To say that these objects have meanings which overflow their physical and functional presence is not enough. In their reaction to such objects the characters of the "chosiste" novel betray an intentional nucleus of their own, a sort of mental depth which can hardly tally with a behaviouristic concept of the mind. But the same phenomenon suggests something much more important, namely, that the type of mental structure displayed by the "chosiste" characters can more adequately be described in terms of depth psychology. To start with, the mind of the "blank hero" is logically disarticu lated. This expresses itself mainly in his perception which suggests either the perception of a child, or the perception of an adult living under abnormal—not necessarily pathological—conditions. As a one year old child perceives every object in the room without being able to perceive the room, the blank hero perceives the objects in their pure heterogeneity. A vague feeling of space contiguity makes his eye move endlessly from one object to another, or from one aspect to another aspect of the same object in a sort of fugue, a fact which explains, at least partly, the "fascination" of space earlier spoken of. The compo sition of his perceptual field tends to fall into two extremes : either rigidly focused on one object which can become the whole world, or dispersed and broken up in independent units. All this is a clear sign of a low degree of integration of the perceptual field of the blank hero which is, in its turn, an expression of a logically disarticulated mind. His obsession with order and geometry, his meticulosity and tendency to over-elaborate are over-compensatory symptoms of the same basic trait. The mind of the blank hero is almost completely dissocialised. His inability to perceive in objects conventional pre-established meanings 137</page><page sequence="12">NOTES CRITIQUES is an aspect of this. There are, however, other more characteristic symptoms. The blank hero's perception of himself is normally below the social and cultural level of his surroundings : he has no status, no particular ties, no long term purpose, no specific beliefs, or ideology. Socially, he is nobody. With a few exceptions—the soldier seems to remember vaguely a sort of friendship—the perception of others is completely depersonalised. In the perceptual field of the soldier, a child has an almost identical significance with that of a lamp-post, or a footstep. This does not mean that the soldier's social relations have a manipulatory character ; they are not "I-It", but rather "It-It" types of relation. The thingness of the social world is more complete than the thingness of the physical world, for if the blank hero has any feelings he prefers to invest them in things rather than in persons. Such degree of depersonalization suggests a schizoid mental struc ture. The basic ambivalence of such a mode of being is only too ob vious : the blank hero swings between the extreme of being nobody and nothing, and the extreme of being everybody and anything. At one extreme, he is merely a cold eye, an impersonal voice, a "tense absence ". At the other extreme, he displays the same existential void by self-alienation. The "soldier" is many other soldiers. More over, he identifies himself with the parcel, which significantly enough contains the life story of another presumedly dead soldier. The identi fication reaches that degree that the story seems to be much more about a parcel carrying a soldier than about a soldier carrying a parcel. In La Jalousie, the Narrator tends to identify himself with Frank ; they may even be one and the same person. In "Last Year in Marien bad", the same phenomenon appears in a much more complex form : X wants to give A a past and a future, that is, his past and his future ; A is, in turn, both X and M who are two modes of being of her person ality. Thus, personalities are amalgamated and inter-changed. Another schizoid trait of the blank hero is expressed by the emotional tonality of his relation with the external world. Here again one can see the same swing between two extremes. At one extreme, the world is cold, frozen, immobile and completely de-emotionalized. At the other extreme, it is vibrating, punctuated by emotional symbols, preg nant with feelings. The film "Last Year in Marienbad" illustrates this well with its alternation between static and dynamic scenes, between flat-depersonalised acting and sudden outbursts of symbolic significances. In Dans le Labyrinthe, the two extremes tend to co-exist in the sense that the world of the soldier is pitifully cold, and tragically objective. What has just been said suggests that the mind of the blank hero is not an empty mind in the common acceptance of this expression, but rather a non-integrated depersonalized mind. This is mainly because it swings between the extreme of withdrawal and that of involvement. Using a more technical vocabulary, this implies that the ego loses its 138</page><page sequence="13">CHOSISME boundaries either under the pressure from outside, or under the pressure from within. In the former case, the identity of the individual is threatened and annihilated by the desensitized world of objects, while, in the latter case, by the flow of diffuse unconscious feelings, such as jealousy, love, fear, insecurity. In La Jalousie, every object is impreg nated with jealousy, and indeed, the world is jealousy, while the husband is but a voice ; in "Last Year in Marienbad", the whole world is love and fear ; in Dans le Labyrinthe, the world itself is insecurity and dread. One cannot close this section without mentioning that most of what has been said in it throws new light on the position occupied by "chosisme" in the historical development of the contemporary novel. Admittedly, the uniqueness of the chosist hero appears less striking if one looks at him with a psychological eye. In France, Camus had certainly made an important step towards the emergence of such a fictional character, the affinities between the hero in L'Étranger and the chosist characters being only too obvious. To start with, Camus' hero also displays a sort of mental emptiness consisting either in a real poverty of conscious stimulation, or in total indifference rooted in a chronic incapacity to valuate, i.e., to select and organise these stimuli and to make an unambiguous decision. The de-emotionali zation of the world is another common trait. Camus' hero suffers from "affectlessness", as Nathan Leites very aptly puts it (4). This means a withdrawal of affection not only from social relations but also from himself, for he seems to have the feeling that someone else is condemned to death. There is also a tendency to swing between the extreme of withdrawal and that of total involvement, for, at least once, the repressed affection breaks through and transfigures the whole world. This happens at the moment of crime, when "[...] a fiery gust came from the sea, while the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured down through the rift". The world is aggression. But despite these important affinities the main character in L'Étranger cannot simply be classified as a "blank hero". The main reason for this lies in the fact that Camus does his best to motivate the mental condition of his hero in terms of the hero's personal experiences. In fact the hero is over-motivated. Thus, his emptiness and his estrange ment from the world and from himself are on the whole behavioural mechanisms resulting both from his early need to repress the unaccept able feeling towards his parents, and from his present need to face imminent death. One of these sets of factors would have been enough to render his mental condition intelligible in terms of depth psychology. This careful and plausible motivation makes it difficult for Camus' (4) "Trends in Affectlessness", in Per sonality, Culture and Society, ed. C. Kluck höhn and H. H. Murray, (New York, 1956). 139</page><page sequence="14">NOTES CRITIQUES hero to represent the human condition in the manner in which the "blank hero" does. With his avoidance of any form of psychologism Robbe-Grillet creates the impression that he is concerned with the human condition at its most general level. His heroes are "there"—as things are "there"—and their mode of being is sheer contemporaneity, that is, without (personal) history. This compels the reader to go beyond the specific structure of the narrative in search of a more general condition of human experience. So much for the psychological analysis of the "chosiste" novel. From what has been said so far one can conclude that the central characters depicted by it are people exhibiting a chronic crisis of self-identity. They are neither innerly, nor socially integrated. What follows is an attempt to describe some of the main sociological determinants of this human condition. 4. The socio-historical background, of the "chosiste" novel. No one who concerns himself with the historical and sociological relevance of the modern novel can fail to notice that the birth of the novel as a literary genre took place in the period of the democratic revolutions, in America and in France. One should hasten to add that the historical significance of this period cannot be confined to the political articulation of modern individualism. In order to bring the problem into focus as quickly and as clearly as possible I propose to discuss here briefly the opinions of a literary historian, L. A. Fiedler, expounded in his recent study of the origins of the modern novel (5). Ac cording to Fiedler, the second half of the eighteenth century in Europe was marked by a violent outburst of all the main individualistic tend encies set loose by the Renaissance and the Reformation. This was the period of the "Break Through" characterised by a cluster of social and cultural events which includes the American and the French Revo lutions, the rise of modern psychology, the triumph of lyric poetry, and the invention of the novel. All this—Fiedler maintains—added up to a "psychic revolution". Obviously, both the concept of the "Break Through" and that of a "psychic revolution" designate one and the same process at two levels. At one level, the process consists of the break through of the lower classes of society which brought about not only a new social order considerably less stable than the previous one, but also a sense of individual freedom verging on social anarchy. The liberation of the individual from the fetters of the old social order was accompanied by a psychological breakthrough, i.e., by a sudden release of a previously repressed mental energy. (5) Love and Death in the American Novel (New York, i960). 140</page><page sequence="15">CHOSISME This was the "psychic revolution" which, according to Fiedler, took place in the second half of the eighteenth century. Perhaps the term revolution makes little sense if one does not stress enough the fact that, during this period, the self-awareness in the individual was heightened to such a degree as to produce a reversal of axis in his existence. The individual began to take his inwardness, his primary impulses and desires, his personal feelings and interests as the main point of reference in his behaviour. In different words, he discovered his personal self and built up his way of life around it. At the cultural level, this was expressed by the triumph of lyric poetry, by the rise of modern psychology, and by the invention of the novel. In the context of the present study, two points have a particular relevance. Firstly, despite some of its formal epic traits, the modern novel is rooted in a lyric introspective orientation of the mind. Socially and culturally the novel has, therefore, the same individualising function as lyric poetry and introspective psychology have. Secondly, the novel expresses this in a much more violent and extreme form than lyric poetry and introspective psychology. In its beginnings the modern novel is little more than the story of an individual leading his life una ware of, or directly opposed to the most basic forms and conventions of social life. It is, indeed, the fictional expression of the innermost anarchic tendencies of the individual's mind. With his psychoanalytical bent, Fiedler identified two closely related anarchic themes dominating the beginning of the novel, the theme of love and the theme of death. The first is illustrated by Diderot's novels, by Laclos' Liaisons dan gereuses, by John Cleland's The Memoirs of Fanny Hill, and finally by the works of Marquis de Sade who heightens the erotic anarchy to such a degree as to encourage "the pervert to mock the normal". In England, Richardson's novels illustrate on the whole the same theme by turning Don Juan, the traditional enemy of Heaven, into a "lovable Loveless". The second theme, that of destruction and death, is repre sented—mainly in the Anglo-Saxon literature—by the fiction of terror and of the fantastic epitomised by the "Gothic novel". Both themes, that of love and death, express in fact the same basic anarchy : "if one would have one's own way one would kill one's father and sleep with one's own mother", says one of Diderot's characters. It is not without obvious reasons that Fiedler describes the early novel as the drama of seduction. It has only to be specified that here, more than in any other context, drama implies a conflict between two individual wills, the struggle between two individuals—a male who attacks and a female who defends herself, or the other way round—who justify their action by the value they place on their personal feelings. Drama arises in situations in which the individual strives, consciously or unconsciously, to live his life as he wishes. Though essentially right in his general view of the period, Fiedler stands somehow too close to Freudian psychology. Consequently, the 141</page><page sequence="16">NOTES CRITIQUES freeing of the individual's mind illustrated by the early modern novel smacks of a large scale release of Oedipal conflicts. This makes one feel that a step backwards from Freud might improve the perspective to the understanding of this complex psycho-historical period. Thus, the situation can be summed up as follows : the period is characterised firstly by an outburst of diffuse mental energy and by an increased self awareness in the individual, both being characteristic of situations of social and cultural disintegration, and secondly, by the projection of this mental energy and increased self-awareness on to the external world. In other words, this marks the beginning of the pathetic fallacy so characteristic of modern civilization. The psychological root of all this lies in a mental process by which the individual invests the external reality—thing, events, persons, society and values—with personal feelings with the ultimate intention of adjusting the whole world to his own desires and projects. There is no need to go into a detailed analysis of this psycho-historical situation, and show how it had artic ulated itself gradually into an individualised society, individualised religion, and finally reaching its apotheosis in that mégalomanie concept of individuality, the Superman. It would be enough to specify that the same psycho-historical process articulates itself in the modern novel, that hero-centred narrative in which an outstanding individual shapes and re-shapes the world on behalf of his subjectivity. A streak of anarchic individualism—some call it romantic—constitutes a main in gredient in the "Weltanschauung" of the modern novel, starting with its early stages mentioned above, and culminating in a Julien Sorel, a Raskolnikov, or a Sanin, to mention only a few illustrative examples. Where does the "chosiste" novel stand in relation to this? There is much truth in the suggestion made by some sociologically-minded critics in France according to which the new novel foreshadows the end of the bourgeois conception of the world. This can easily serve as the starting point for a sociological analysis of the "chosiste" novel provided that the term bourgeois is stripped of its narrow interpretation— Marxian, or otherwise—and made to connote a specific personality structure dominant in Western civilization since the Renaissance (6). (6) At this stage it is relevant to clarify a point of principle by a short comparative reference to a well known sociological study of the modern novel, namely, G. Lukâcs' The Historical Novel. This is all the more necessary as Lukâcs covers approximately the same historical period. Lukâcs is a "refined" Marxist. He sees the development of the historical novel in terms of a plurality of variables, such as the historical position of the bourgeoisie and of the working class, the political and ideological expression of class relations, the class identification of various writers. On the basis of this complex scheme he distin guishes three main periods in the develop ment of the historical novel representing three basic fictional expressions of modern society. However, despite its refinement this is in essence a rigidly class-centred approach. Its shortcomings become particularly appar ent when Lukâcs tries to establish subtle differences between various artistic styles, as for instance, between Realism and Naturalism. He cannot maintain his point of view without becoming highly abstract and dogmatic. 142</page><page sequence="17">CHOSISME In this broad sense one can say that the "chosiste" novel foreshadows the end of modern bourgeois personality structure. Needless to say that terms such as "bourgeois" and "modern" involve a high degree of generalization. Despite this, a broad comparative survey of the main data of present-day cultural and social anthropology seems to allow the identification of some differential traits of a personality structure which can conveniently be called modern bourgeois. Here are some of the main traits of this type of personality : The modern bourgeois personality has a possessive attitude which colors his outlook of life : the distance between "I" and "Mine" is so small that the feeling and the idea of property seem to lie at the basis of the process of self-identification. Egotising the world, physical, social and moral, is so important for the process of adjustment that it often has a survival value. Liberation and freedom are key values in his own life and in the history of his society. Secondly, the bourgeois personality has strong ego-centric isolationist tendencies. The indi vidual with such a personality structure displays a permanent incli nation to perceive society either as a simple means for, or as direct resistance to self-realisation : the feeling of distance and isolation is a symptom of self-affirmation. It is significant to note that the main anarchic and nihilistic trends, in modern civilization, are essentially anti-social rather than anti-personal. Closely related to this is the vis ceral trait characteristic of the bourgeois personality : the feeling of one's body lies at the basis of the ego. The physiological orientation of modern psychology illustrates this only too clearly. Thirdly, the modern bourgeois personality assumes a metaphysical character. While everything in the modern world—including God—becomes more and more relative, personality alone remains an end in itself. This meta physical trait explains the stress put by modern psychology, and modern culture in general, on the unity, continuity and identity of human personality. Now one can understand why the "chosiste" characters epitomised by the catabasic hero, indicate the end of the modern bourgeois person ality. While the latter is possessive the former is detached, more over, dominated by the world of objects. While the latter tends towards a self-assertive isolation, the former tends towards submer gence and alienation. The latter tends towards higher and higher integration and constancy while the former lives in a chronic crisis Though terms such as "bourgeoisie" and "working class" are often used in my study, the basic approach is a personality centred one. My main concern is to show how the various stages in the development of the modern novel express the prevailing personality structure in modern society. Thus, the conceptual frame of reference of my sociological analysis of the modern novel is considerably broader than that of Lukâcs', for the simple reason that the personality structure prevailing in a certain society depends on a great variety of factors, social, cultural, technological and psychological, of which class structure is only one. 143</page><page sequence="18">NOTES CRITIQUES of self-identity. In the bourgeois personality, the visceral element is an important ingredient, while the "chosiste" hero has his body de sensitized to the degree of thingness. All this can be summed up by pointing to the difference between a cathectic and catabasic relation with the world. How can one explain this radical change in the relationship between the individual and his world? Why this withdrawal and falling out of love with the world? Can one identify some objective factors, social and cultural by which one can explain, at least partly, the emergence of a catabasic personality structure as this is portrayed by the "chosiste" novel? Needless to say that in tackling such questions I do not expect either a single, or a simple answer. Though I assume that "chosisme" expresses some important aspects of human life in contemporary Western civilization I cannot and do not assume that this civilization as whole moves in the same direction. Any civilization is, at any stage in its development, a complex system of currents and counter-currents. All I can do, therefore, in trying to answer the above questions is to identify some broad trends behavioural and institutional which point towards a concept of human life as that portrayed by the "chosiste" novel. The first trend concerns the relationship between the individual and his society. Though much of what has been written about the influence which a large scale industrial society has upon the personality of the individual has a direct bearing on this point, the problem cannot be discussed here for a twofold reason : firstly, it is, on the whole, common knowledge ; secondly, as a general hypothesis, it has been often abused ; far too much has been said about the isolation and lone liness of the individual living in such a society. There are, however two points particularly relevant in the present context. The first point consists in a specific difficulty, if not impossibility of a balanced relation and communication between the individual and a large scale modern society. In such a society, the individual is either over-integrated, or under-integrated; he can be over-integrated with his political party, or his trade union, and at the same time, under integrated with his family. For reasons which need not be discussed here, both over- and under-integration cause a weakening of the feeling of self-identity, and a blur of the boundaries of the individual's personality. The second point refers to a deeper aspect of the relation between the individual and his society, namely, to the awareness which the individual has about the origins of his society. Since the Renaissance, and particularly since the period of the democratic revolutions, Western civilization has fostered in the individual the belief that he is the maker and the possessor of his society. At present, this belief is on the point of vanishing altogether. Two world wars with their disrupting effects, the famous twentieth century totalitarian movements and 144</page><page sequence="19">CHOSISME ideologies, displacement of population on a large scale, and last, but not least, that formidable "deterrent" which can, within seconds, bring the whole world to complete ruin, all this has contributed to weaken in the individual the feeling of authorship with regard to his society. Instead, a new feeling and attitude seem to become more and more dominant, namely, an attitude of resignation and apathy towards society. More than one investigation, and in more than one country of the Western world, support the main findings of A. Andrieux and J. Lignon regarding attitudes of the French industrial workers towards their society (7). A resigned and evasionist attitude is by far more frequent than a realist constructive attitude. In no other time was the myth of progress more discredited than in the post-war period. This attitude of disinvolvement is expressed by the "chosiste" novel in an extreme form. The blank hero has a dissocialized mind in the sense that most of his social rôles are either vague, or completely ir relevant. A few brief remarks on one of the basic rôles in our society, the sex rôle, would be enough to illustrate this point. As shown in a previous section, the blank hero does not integrate himself with any specific sex rôles such as husband, lover, male, female. This makes one suspect that the society to which such a character belongs contains powerful forces, economic, ideological or psychological, which work for a low degree of sex differentiation. It would not take long to prove that such forces do exist in most contemporary Western societies. They express themselves in an increasing economic, political and educational equality between the sexes, and often in a strange tendency towards an identity of habits, of dress, of taste and aspirations. The preference manifested by the younger generations in particular for the "boyish girls" and the "girlish boys" respectively, the emergence of B. Bardot as a sex symbol are symptomatic in this respect. No less symptomatic are some recent trends in love relations which point to the decline of the romantic type of love, that highly articulated love-relation between two ego-centred personalities involving fear of, and at the same time, enthusiasm for self-sacrifice. Love tends to become a more equalitarian form of relation, a sort of association. Some sociological investigations point to the development of a more sexually neutral love with a preponderant therapeutic character (8). No wonder that the new novel is no longer a "drama of seduction", for such a drama exists and becomes a problem only in a highly articu lated society regarding the sex rôles of its members. In the Mediaeval "male" society, the drama of seduction took place at a spiritual level, mainly as the struggle between virtue (male) and temptation (female). In the modern individualistic society, the same drama took place at a psychological level, as a conflict between two personalities closely (7) L'ouvrier d'aujourd'hui (Paris 1960). (8) G. C. Homans, Paper read at the Scottish (Sociological (Association, No vember 1956. 145</page><page sequence="20">NOTES CRITIQUES integrated with their sex rôles. In contemporary society, the drama tends to be suspended by the confused position occupied by its pro tagonists. The blank hero lives outside the concrete forms of his society, and at the same time, outside concrete history. His existence is geared neither to a general purpose of mankind, nor to a more specific purpose of his class or nation. The recollection which Robbe-Grillet's soldier has about the battle of "Reisenfels", a battle in which his nation and all that it stood for lost its independence, the perception he has of the conquerors occupying his fatherland, have no historical concrete char acter. They are myths and hallucinations and the story can easily be about invading Martians. Is this vision of history also conditioned? A first answer to such a question can be found in all those ideol ogies which speak about the decline of the historical purpose of con temporary Western cultures. But not only ideologies. There are also those "retreatist" attitudes and feelings mentioned at an earlier stage in this study. All this points to the individual's awareness that his life can neither be enlightened nor fulfilled by a set of communal beliefs and values presented to him by a purposeful society. This often leads to a "non-serviam" attitude with all the terror which such freedom and isolation imply. I hasten to add, however, that this attitude does not imply rebellion ; those who still maintain that they are rebels have long forgotten what they rebelled against. Being unable to find a sub stitute for the dying beliefs and values, these individuals live in a com pletely demythologised world ; they are neither for, nor against society, neither for, nor against humanity, neither for, nor against the world. "The world is neither meaningful nor absurd, it just is", says Robbe Grillet. Though a philosophical interpretation lies beyond the scope of the present study, one can hardly avoid the more general question regarding the meaning of this "objective" vision of the world. Nothing can offer a more suggestive answer to this question than Robbe-Grillet's attitude towards religion. Once being asked about the place occupied by God in his picture of the human life he shrugged his shoulders ; I am not con cerned with this. A young Soviet astronaut expressed this more clearly in reply to an old woman's query about the existence of God : "I scruti nised the cosmos and saw no trace of God". However, this is hardly surprising. What is surprising is the fact that a number of enlightened Protestant theologians concerned with the fate of Christian doctrine and beliefs within contemporary Western civilization have arrived at similar conclusions. It is not only that these theologians can no longer see any trace, and indeed any justification of a "liberal" theology expressing faith in the divine progress of the world. They have gone much further. According to them, any attempt made by man in the past to bring and keep God in the world has ended in anthropomorphism. Today, 146</page><page sequence="21">CHOSISME however, the world has come of age and the main symptom of this consists in the striving of contemporary man to free himself from the pathetic fallacy in his relation with God. After a profound examination of the religious predicament of the people living in this adult world, Bonhoeffer comes to the conclusion that they have to learn how to live in a Godless universe (9). In such a world, says one of Bonhoeffer's interpreters, "Theologia Gloriae" is dead while "Theologia Crucis" claims absolute supremacy (10). If this means anything it is that God is crushed by the naked—Robbe-Grillet says objective—presence of the world. Thus, God ceases to exist to the extent to which man refuses to be concerned with, and involved in Him. But this applies also to the ex istence of the world as such, for man's involvement and adventure in the world is, at the same time, the adventure of the world itself. Conse quently, a de-emotionalized, devaluated and de-humanized world is in fact a shrinking world. This is just another way of saying that a vision of the world as it is, is rooted in the same catabasic attitude to life which had been identified under so many forms in the preceding pages. In conclusion one can say that the "chosiste" novel expresses and often magnifies all those trends set loose in contemporary civilization by a reaction against subjectivity and all the basic values rooted in it, such as initiative, freedom and responsibility. Apathy and lack of project indicate but a first stage in this reaction. By freeing himself from his inwardness contemporary man becomes more and more engulfed in the thingness of the world. It may well be that in some important way contemporary industrial and technological civilization leads towards a neo-magic conception of the world. Thus, the "chosiste" novel foreshadows a conception of the world in which things, manufactured, or natural, act as hidden persuaders threatening and killing man's interiority.
