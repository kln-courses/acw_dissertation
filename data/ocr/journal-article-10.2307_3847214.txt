No order that can bind and loose self-violence and mass-abuse, no order that can loose and bind the shambles under the human mind; no order ripens into weather unless it bind and loose together chaos of good consuming ill, of lovers who search and shun God's will. This is language in its best and most direct manner, the plena rosa of poetry. It is not obscurity that makes Blackmur's poetry difficult, but our own un- familiarity. A Modern Allegory LAWRENCE McMILLIN A MASQUE OF MERCY by Robert Frost. Henry Holt &amp; Co. $2.50 IN A MASQUE OF REASON, published two years ago, and in the recent A Masque of Mercy, Robert Frost has fostered the revival of an old and bastard poetic form. He has recognized the possibility of combining some of the best elements of the Platonic dialogue, the Puritan allegory, and the closet drama in a modern philosophical and religious form of masque. What makes these masques remarkable does not, however, make them successful poetry. A Masque of Reason is a twentieth century revision of Job. This twenty- three page dialogue, more clever than weighty, gingerly moves about the vast problem of reconciling the tribulation visited upon the just and unjust alike with the notion of a reasonably benevolent God. The characters are God, Job, the devil, and Thyatira, Job's apocalyptic wife. God is such a vain and incompetent old buffoon that Mr. Frost may be making fun of the funda- mentalists and twitting his own skepticism as well. Job appears as a wealthy</page><page sequence="2">106 THE HUDSON REVIEW retired nomad. The devil looks like "a sapphire wasp that flickers mica wings," and God agrees with Job that the devil has lost his vitality. To Job's con- tention that "We can't leave him out," God replies: No. No we don't need to. We're too well off. Later God elaborates: church neglect And figurative use have pretty well Reduced him to a shadow of himself. The fundamental impropriety of the poem is in its philosophical burlesque and anthropomorphic horseplay. God's excuse for allowing Job to suffer ("I was just showing off to the devil, Job") is neither amusing nor original. Thyatira's remark: That's God. I'd know Blake's picture anywhere. is clever, but inappropriate. Such theological banter is revolting to the ortho- dox, bewildering to the faithful, and unconvincing to the secular mind. Mil- ton, the master of English prophetic poetry, and his masters, the Hebrew psalmists and prophets, knew that the poet, to clothe the letter with the life of myth and prophecy, must resist the temptation to let wit get the better of judgment. Perhaps Mr. Frost has been overconsious of contemporary taste. Perhaps he is appointing us to forsake the cult of intellectualized sensation by reintro- ducing the theme of man's concern with the Unknown. Nevertheless, what is substantially lacking is that sense of tragedy without which the theme of human tribulation becomes a cosmic joke. A connecting link between the first and second masques is the name Mr Frost gives Job's wife. Thyatira is one of the seven churches in the Book of the Apocalypse. The church of Thyatira is reprimanded for tolerating a false prophetess named Jezebel who was (or will be) mixing prophecy with fornication. In A Masque of Reason Job's wife querulously asks God why prophetesses should be persecuted more frequently than their male colleagues. In A Masque of Mercy the prophetess Jezebel turns up as Jesse Bel, an arche- type of the modern woman of the nineteen-twenties. Both Thyatira and Jesse Bel are petulant feminists; Mr. Frost, like Mr. Shaw, has gleaned rather than borrowed from the wealth of Christian lore, but less sucessfully. Comedy is not equally at home everywhere and complexes of wit can be wasteful effort. In the more successful Masque of Mercy, Mr. Frost is manipulating per- sonalities with which he is somewhat more familiar. The Keeper of a prole- tarian bookstore opens his door to Jonas, an agrarian Jonah who is escaping from a storm and trying to escape the commission of his God. Besides Jesse Bel, Keeper, and Jonas, there is Paul, a modern off-shoot of the first Christian</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 107 missionary and theologian. These characters work and act out a tentative solution to the problem of mercy and justice in the Christian God's relation with man: Nothing can make injustice just but mercy. The kind of piety which results from this conclusion is an heroic metaphysical vitalism. The uncertainty whether even our sacrifice, the best we have to offer, may be found acceptable in heaven's sight causes a profound metaphysical fear within us which seems to be a near relation of what the Existentialists call anxiety. We must take courage, the necessary complement to our basic skepticism, in order that we may persevere to great accomplishment. The characters reach the conclusion that St. Paul's New Testament mercy, not Keeper's Marxist or Jonas' Old Testament justice, can save us from the perils of uncertainty. The clamor for justice becomes a futile arrogance, making uncertainty unbearable. A Masque of Mercy has greater density, solidity, and relevance to its theme than the earlier masque. The poem in spite of itself departs from the desperate flippancy and impertinent ingenuity which have been the curse of much recent reflective poetry. Nevertheless, it suffers more than the first masque from technical defects which stem from a similar failure to suit emotion to the theme. It is hard to believe, for instance, that Keeper should think that Rockwell Kent is the author of Moby Dick. Jesse Bel's erratic intellect is unconvincing. Sometimes she talks in the manner of a simpleton; sometimes in the manner of a female Socrates. At times, the characters' behavior is abstrusely mechanical; the emotional response of Keeper, Jesse Bel, and Paul to Jonas' death is particularly inadequate. Mr. Frost has unsuccessfully tried to turn the Miltonic trick of transforming his characters into particularized universals. He has packed much traditional material into this second masque without seeking the formal unity characteristic of Miltonic drama and epic. Such witty irrelevancies as a quip about The New Yorker magazine do but flounder in the mass of traditional philosophy and religion both symbolically and directly expressed. Mr. Frost has not created myth. Turning to the question of style, I question whether the trim, deft line and the simple syntax of which Mr. Frost is master, are fitting or adequate for the purposes of prophetic poetry. Milton could never have succeeded by employing the styles and forms of his contemporary, Robert Herrick. But Mr. Frost is in general to be commended for his courageous if ill-executed at- tempts to redirect poetry in these days of existential anxiety and psychosomatic medicine. If he succeeds, the soul may gain a poetic currency which it has not enjoyed since the commencement of the Cartesian era.</page></plain_text>
