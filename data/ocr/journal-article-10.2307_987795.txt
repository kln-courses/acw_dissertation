<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITIQUE ON THE TAJ MAHAL CLAY LANCASTER THE TAJ MAHAL has been admired by poets, artists, peas- ants, world travelers and casual American tourists; it has been showered with every epithet of praise proper to all the major languages of the world and to a goodly portion of the minor ones as well. The Taj Mahal has been found dis- tasteful by members of all those groups and consequently derided by a comparable amount of slandering phrases. It is only natural that any object attracting so much admira- tion should call forth a considerable backwash of discredit also. Taste in art varies from person to person according to the experience that has befallen the individual and the con- ditioning he has been subjected to, and criticism is ra- tionalization that attempts to justify what is liked and to condemn what is not. Although the object of outspoken criticism is to convert others, as often as not it leaves them indifferent or antagonized. The only tangible gain, really, is to release certain feelings on the part of the critic him- self. With no more lofty aim in mind than this I set out to state my case with regard to the building that signals the high water mark of Mughal architecture. In our century one of the severest and, at the same time, best known critics of the Taj Mahal has been Aldous Hux- ley, whose comments first appeared in his travel book, Jest- ing Pilate,' and several years ago were repeated in the de- luxe Indian art magazine, Marg.2 Mr. Huxley recounts his visit to the Taj-if I may be allowed this abbreviated and colloquial designation-at sunset. The choice of hour was at the advice of his guide, he said. He describes the build- ing as "picturesque," and apparently he considers it in a class with Sezincote or the Pavilion at Brighton, the two famous examples of romantic, mock-Mughal architecture in England. Anyway, Huxley went when the sun was going down, and he speaks of the silver of the river, the rich verdancy of the gardens, the evening sounds of birds and insects, the changing colors of the sky, and the presentiment of the planets Venus and Mercury. He was impressed by everything he saw-with the exception of the building. "Nature," he says, "did its best," but "the Taj was a dis- appointment." The display of expense is his first objection to the Taj Mahal. To reproduce the monument would require as much as a fifteenth to a tenth of what the Viceroy spends annually on the Indian army, he muses, as though a work of art can be reckoned in terms of what is poured down the drain each year for imperialist suppression and defense. For over 300 years the Taj has nourished men's souls, and it is to be hoped that it will continue to do so for many cen- turies to come, long after those of today's little brief au- thority have passed into oblivion. The worst elements of the building, architecturally, Hux- ley opines, are the minarets, which are "unconscionably slender." He would replace the flanking shafts by four low forms, unaware that this would destroy the envelope of space created about the central mass by the tall uprights, adding so much to the three-dimensional effectiveness of the composition. He objects to the taper of the minarets, to the edging of black around each block of marble, and to the balcony bands placed "at just the wrong intervals of dis- tance from one another and from the ground." It must be agreed that the black edgings could have been dispensed with to advantage, but the spacing of the balconies bears a logical relationship to the main building, the heights cor- responding to the levels of the upper floor and roof ter- race. The Taj is dull, Huxley believes, "the product not of intellectual restraint imposed on an exuberant fancy, but of an actual deficiency of fancy, a poverty of imagination." He perceives only two contrasting formal elements of de- sign, the dome, of which the shape is reflected in the pointed portals, and the flat rectangular wall surfaces. He misses the fact that the convex domes and recessed portals are not similar but complimentary manifestations of the same motif, the sort of harmonious contrast that adds up to an interesting unity. His limited view of the monument leads him to conclude that the Taj is far inferior to contemporary buildings in Europe, citing St. Paul's in London and the Villa Rotunda near Vicenza for comparison. St. Paul's, built a generation after the Taj, is an architec- tural pile made up of a large variety of component parts, including a "hemispherical dome, the great colonnaded cylinder of the drum, the flat sidewalls relieved [sic] by square-faced pilasters and rounded niches ... at one end, the curved surfaces of the apse and, at the other, the West Front with its porch-a design of detached cylinders (the pillars), seen against a flat wall, and supporting yet another formal element, the triangular pediment." His description of Wren's magnum opus is drawn from a nostalgic mem- ory. Crowded in among a jumble of commonplace houses, CLAY LANCASTER, formerly secretary-treasurer of the Society, is a free-lance writer on architecture-sometimes architectural history, at other times with a lighter touch.

With porticoes tastelessly stacked one on top of the other, one must look closely for the "detached cylin- ders" of which Huxley speaks. One finally sees them, like pencils in the conglomerate mass, arranged in couples across the fagade, the outer ones not a column's width in front of the solid stonework of the building. One scrutinizes yet more closely for the "flat wall." It is in vain. Every sur- oow0 __.__. ._  -- -r" JM AHAL o 0 MOSQUCQ L0 ALL o 0 -1 -I~6 - -- LPC[ .. . . I I . .. I a- Di W- HH ....HH ???

Shaded areas indicate pools. face is tattooed with rustication, pilasters and entablatures, gouged with niches and recesses, overspread with every conceivable motif of classical relief, with edicules piled on top of edicules, galleries in the air, roofs tortured into weird shapes-a veritable Hanging Gardens of Babylon in Baroque style without benefit of garden plants, a grim and grimy oversized birthday cake! St. Paul's dome is twice the height of that of the Taj, and the building being so much larger, "we should therefore expect the number of contrasting elements in its design to be greater ..." Huxley's liking for St. Paul's goes deeper than British sentiment for the symbol of the state religion; its architec- ture genuinely appeals to his English taste. From this same racial norm of appreciation stems his favorable regard for the Villa Rotunda in northeast Italy as well, judging from the times the building was reproduced by wealthy English- men captivated by its charms: in Chiswick House, Mere- worth Castle, Footscray, Nuthall Temple, and the Temple of the Four Winds at Castle Howard. In size the Rotunda is to the Taj as the latter is to St. Paul's, about half as large. Aldous Huxley perceives Palladio's sixteenth-century villa to incorporate "a far larger number of formal elements than does the Taj." He is thinking of the hexastyle Ionic porticoes (on each of the four sides, all just alike), with broad flights of steps (very un-residence-like in character) leading up to them, the pediments over windows as well as porticoes, and the dome timidly penetrating the square hipped roof. Are the elements here truly more varied than those of the Taj, or is it merely that because one has a term for each component of classic architecture that one assumes more distinction of parts than actually exists? We need only examine the two examples. The villa is a cube with a pyramid roof truncated by a cone on top, with porticoes relieving the static form. The Taj, on the other hand, is a prism whose many sides catch the light in vary- ing shades, intensities, and gradations due to reflections from its terraces. It is dominated by a great bulbous dome, which form is echoed by four smaller domes atop open pavilions around the base of the round central drum, and by others on subsidiary constructions. In contrast to these are the recessed portals-varying in size like the domes themselves-in each face of the building and in the facades of its dependencies. The fullness of the principal mass is accented by the attenuation of the minarets at each corner of the platform that lifts the entire structure up off the ground. It is mirrored in slightly elevated pools along the main axis of the layout, and, thus appearing inverted, the earth itself is transformed into a flat tray with thin air below as well as above it. There is no "poverty of imagina- tion" here, if one but has eyes to perceive it. Huxley asserts that Hindu buildings are superior to those of the Moslems, and although this is in line with his preference for complicated plasticity, one suspects that the comment was inserted partly from a desire to heap further 8 Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, XV, 4</page><page sequence="3">coals of condemnation upon the head of the Taj. There are indeed many early native architectural masterpieces in India, but to compare these with Mughal work is to com- pare butterflies with flowers; they are simply not of the same species of being. A Hindu building is subjective, a Moslem objective. The Hindu temple is an abode of mys- tery, an articulated pyramidal mass with a labyrinth of end. less corridors, the very walls pullulating gods and votaries in sculptured figures; the Moslem structure is bright and open, with firm, curvilinear shapes embellished with brightly colored, flat arabesque patterns or decorative kufic inscriptions in place of anthropomorphic reliefs. Each is the embodiment of a distinct viewpoint, farther removed from one another than that of St. Paul's or the Rotunda from the Taj. The author of the criticism detects shortcomings in the ornamentation of the Taj Mahal, in the stylized floral de- signs of inlaid jasper, bloodstone and agate. The observa- tion is justified insofar as the quality of the patterns and skill of workmanship in themselves cannot measure up to FIG. 2-The main pavilion of the Taj Mahal seen reflected in a portion of the central basin, the planting restored to what is conceived to have been its original state. those of some of the other Mughal buildings of India, notably the Tomb of I'timad-ud-Daula at Agra or Huma- yun's Tomb at Delhi. This last mausoleum (built some 70 years earlier than the Taj Mahal) may have served to in- spire the Taj, though having not nearly so compact a form and lacking minarets, combining red sandstone with mar- ble, and achieving its polychromed ornamentation through the opus sectile rather than the pietra dura technique, using colored opaque stone rather than luminous, semi-precious gems. It must be conceded, however, that the lucent quality of the inlay material at the Taj would call for a more deli- cate type of design than that of the earlier monuments, especially with a background composed entirely of high- keyed translucent marble. Can one seriously compare such exquisite substances with Palladio's stuccoed brickwork, or even with Wren's prosaic Portland stone? With regard to ornament it is to be recalled that classic architectural decoration attained its apogee in the Erechtheum at the end of the fifth century B.C. and was therefore already debased when taken over in any of the major Roman edi- fices; although its form was revived a millennium and a half later in the Renaissance, its spirit had long before passed beyond recall. To appreciate fully the architecture of the Taj it should be viewed in the light of the Islamic building tradition. The Moslems patterned their monuments after those of the Byzantines, just as the Romans had based theirs upon the buildings of the Hellenes, only with this difference: whereas the Romans borrowed anything and everything without reservation, the Moslems took only what fitted in with their orthodox ideas, modifying the remainder in such a way so as not to oppose their dogma. The Semitic mind never conceived a religious restriction with happier effects upon art than that of the taboo against portraying natural forms, a tightening up of the old Jewish abhorrence of the graven image-perpetuated also in the Eastern Christian church-here extended by the followers of Muhammed to the exclusion of two-dimensional as well as carved repre- sentation. The Moslems made their own contributions to the magnificent manipulation of volumes developed by the Byzantines, but rejected the doleful figures of their saints, angels and gods populating the visionary Heavenly City, sitting in awesome judgment against all who entered the Christian house of worship. The directness of the Moslem faith that focuses attention upon the adoration of a single god would tolerate none of this polytheistic idolatry, and its artists set about to devise their own mode of architec- tural enrichment. The conceptual change in the decoration made the dif- ference between the ominous mood of the Byzantine church and the inviting, refreshing atmosphere of the Islamic mosque. Colorful designs developed among the minor arts were adapted to the embellishment of buildings. These de- signs which, for the most part constituted overall patterns A Critique on the Taj Mahal 9</page><page sequence="4">of geometric shapes and flat plant motifs in semi-abstrac- tion, gradually developed into those elegant and graceful interlacings that we call arabesques. Here ornament re- mained true to its real objective, to overspread the form in such a way as to reveal, enhance and enliven it, by throw- ing out over its broad areas intricate networks of exquisite lines and rhythmic figures in clear and joyous hues. Fol- lowing long-established indigenous techniques, in the Near East and Persia these designs were executed in glazed tiles and faience, and in India-as we have seen-in stone inlay. As we turn our attention once more toward the Taj it is to appreciate its beauty in terms of pure design. How often the western mind has been deluded into using the orders for fagade decoration in the misapprehension that engaged columns and entablatures express structure, whereas in reality these excrescences protruding from load-bearing walls add more weight than they support, and one is dis- turbed rather than fooled by the artifice. The Taj is inno- cent of such ineffectual references. It is also stainless of realistic sculptures that ill conform to elementary archi- tectural forms, of which so much of monumental occi- dental architecture is guilty, where friezes and pediments are insensitively overcrowded with writhing nude bodies.3 The impression derived from the Taj Mahal is quite dif- ferent from that of traditional western buildings, whether based on earthbound ancient temples or stalagmitic-peaked medieval cathedrals. The eye is captivated by the un- strained proportions of the smooth forms and comes to rest upon the magnificent crowning dome, whose firm con- tour swings out beyond the line of the supporting drum, thus rendering the great round mass a buoyant and weight- less spheroid suspended in the azure sky. The Taj has a bold simplicity unrealized in European structures larger than shrines. The Taj has to be considered in relation to its setting, a walled, landscaped rectangle almost a thousand feet across and over half that again in depth, divided into a broad forecourt, the main square garden, and the terrace of the Taj proper. The accompanying layout (Fig. 1) is redrawn from a plan made in 1828 by Colonel Hodgson, Surveyor- General to India. It was made before certain changes were effected, especially in the south court, where the wide oval drive was replaced by a rectangular area and additions made to the buildings, and a general Europeanization of the planting took place in the main garden. One enters the principal enclosure from the forecourt through a large cubic gateway of polychrome stonework with turrets or attached minarets at the corners. The garden is laid out in geometric shapes by paved walks and long marble pools radiating from an elevated square tank in the center. The walks and pools are flanked by rows of trees that originally must have alternated slender cypresses or other evergreens with flowering deciduous varieties. The sixteen outlying squares are bounded by hedges, each becoming a little se- cluded paradise-to apply the word that we have borrowed from the Persians. One calls to mind the sparse planting seen in gardens pictured in fifteenth-century Iranian minia- tures and thereby comes to understand the reason for the loose character of the pietra dura work on the Taj itself. The tall minarets take on new meaning when one considers how they would look glimpsed through and viewed tower- ing above the trees and hedges that conceal much of the lower portion of the structures except from specific axial vantage points (Fig. 2). The scheme of the garden is that of an Eastern carpet on which predominant motifs are dis- tributed along the edges and brought into relationship to one another by means of intervening figures. Often, how- ever, the most important design is in the center, and in Mughal gardens this is usually the case. But at the Taj the principal element is at one end, which affords the building an impressive vista from the whole garden on one side and from and over the River Jumna on the other. The placing of the Taj adjacent to the river gives ostensible support to the tradition that the builder, Shah Jehan, proposed erect- ing a facsimile on the opposite shore, the two connected by a bridge, the duplicate perhaps built of black marble. The stream, therefore, would have become the center of the composition, a cross axis that extended far away in either direction to the remote provinces of India (Fig. 3). Taver- nier, the French traveller and trader, who visited the realm during the reign of Shah Jehan, states that the emperor in- tended to build a tomb for himself matching that of his beloved wife-and still visible today are traces of pre- liminary excavations on the north bank-but war with his son put an end to Shah Jehan's proposed mausoleum, and his remains eventually were deposited alongside those of the empress Arjunand Banu Begum in the first and only Taj. The son, Aurangzeb, who obstructed his father's memorial project, built a tomb vaguely resembling the Taj Mahal for his spouse far to the south, but the design turned out considerably inferior to that of its prototype in the mat- ter of grace and beauty. Indeed, it is so clumsy and ill con- ceived that this building at Aurangabad coincides much better than the jewel on the River Jumna with the rebuttals in the Huxley essay. It is beyond my present intention to enter into any of the controversies that have been raging with regard to the Taj Mahal, other than to express an opinion that the possibility of a western architect is absurd; the design is eastern in every respect. I hope to have made this clear earlier through pointing out its fundamentally abstract nature, its freedom from references to orders that characterize traditional monumental architecture of the Occident. The rumor re- ferred to is known to have been started by a misinformed missionary who arrived on the scene after the death of the alleged architect, actually a goldsmith, one among many of various nationalities employed by Shah Jehan to work on 10 Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, XV, 4</page><page sequence="5">the decoration of his famous peacock throne and other furnishings. If one is interested in pursuing the subject, the names of the architects, superintendents and builders, as well as other data pertinent to the erection of the building, can be found in any one of several monographs on the Taj Mahal, such as Maulvi Moin-ud-din Ahmad's The Taj and Its Environments,4 and Muhammad Abdulla Chughtai's Le Tadj Mahal d'Agra.5 1.
