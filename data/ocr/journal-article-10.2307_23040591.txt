<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Nature and background of major concepts of divine power in Homer. ODYSSEUS TSAGARAKIS. B. R. Griiner. 1977. Pp xviii+160. Fl. 60. The author of this short but valuable study set himself a difficult task— 'the problematic question of how factual really is the poetic religion of the Iliad and Odyssey'. In other words, when gods intervene in the Homeric poems is it an artistic device—'divine machinery' as Alexander Pope and others have thought—or an expression of religious belief? A further difficult question is involved here: how much of the religious element in the poems is traditional and how much invented by the poet? In the reviewer's opinion these are unanswerable questions because of the inadequacy of the external evidence. But they are certainly worth thinking about. The main body of the book consists of seven chapters on Zeus, Apollo, Athene, Theoi, Theos, Daimon and Moira. Here all the relevant passages are assembled and considered in the light of evidence from historical sources including parallels from modern Greece (as for example in con temporary uses of the word moira). All this is done with exemplary thoroughness and with ample documentation from modern works of scholarship (though a good many misprints have crept in). On the much disputed question of whether Homer's references to a god or gods without specifying any name implies some idea of 'a general deity'—a happy groping after monotheism, as some scholars interpreted it—Tsagarakis firmly decides in the negative. They are not essentially different from the named anthropomorphic gods. The conclusion is not surprising. The religion of the Homeric poems is partly contrived for poetic purposes, partly an echo of the remote past, and partly a reflection of popular beliefs. But all students of Homer are likely to find the presentation of the relevant material very helpful. W. B. STANFORD</page></plain_text>
