Tracing a similar dilemma in New Genetics and Biology, the paper argues that the contemporary fascination with the knot as a model of non-linear, topological systems enables us to look at the importance of binding in the creation of the figurai in Oceanic art from a new perspective. This paper intends to open up the investigation of bind- ing as technique and as patterned design in its distinct articulation in artifactual form across the Pacific by raising questions about the relation between the figurai and the social. The material provoking the rethinking of the difference created by material articulation of the mundane, personal, and yet also profoundly mathematical technique of binding in society and culture is that of malanggan figurative art. Pacific artworks are well known for their capacity to simultaneously contain and elicit all prior and future works (cf. Wagner 1987; Strathern 1991). As 'multiples,' artworks of this kind counterpoise the western assumption of the unique object and thus engage the concep- tual frame of modernism in ways that enable us to overcome the latent opposition of west- ern and non-western art still rampant in anthropological studies of art (cf. Geli 1998). Like Mondrian's grids, such artworks as New Ireland malanggan or Trobriand canoe-prows appear to originate from the figurai, visualised as a graphic as well as a technical schema which also serves as the discursive element in art that otherwise resists exegesis (Summers 1989). This paper sets out to investigate the figurai in the art of the Pacific, as it is exempli- fied by the design structure and 'cross-hatching' of Australian Aboriginal barkpaintings (cf. Morphy 1991), by the looped binding of netbags (MacKenzie 1991) and by my own account of the malanggan image to which I will return in this paper (cf. Kuchler 1987, 1988; Kuchler and Melion 1991). By revealing the figurai in Pacific artworks to be a material trace of alternative tech- niques of binding, that is of knotting and looping, I hope to shed a new perspective on what became known as the 'epidemiology' of cultural representations (Sperber 1985; Geli 1993). Oceania 69, 1999 145</page><page sequence="2">Binding in the Pacific Following previous uses of the epidemiological model, the question driving this paper is what enables cultural representations to catch on in certain social and cultural situations and not in others. At present, we have two solutions to such a question: Sperber (1985) argued for sus- ceptibility towards representations to be grounded in the affinity between cognitive processes governing representations and cognitive processes sustaining culture. Geli (1993), conversely, saw susceptibility to be embedded in the biographical and relational space within which tech- nical virtuosity is selectively appropriated. Binding, in its continuous and yet varied articula- tion across the Pacific, serves as a perfect example to both re-examine these positions and to point to a possible resolution to the conflicting emphasis on the cognitive versus the social in the validation of cultural representations. This is because binding is not part of an esoteric knowledge technology, but is profoundly embedded in the mundane and thus habituated space within which knowledge is externalised; in addition to its embeddedness in the mundane, binding is uniquely bringing to bear upon material affective, personal, as well as mathematical and thus cognitive attitudes and concepts which amplify ways of thinking. Rather than assum- ing that the figurative expresses ideas which are already existing, could it be that its transmis- sion has a dynamic which creates a lasting difference in culture and society? RETHINKING TEMPLATES' It has become common practice to describe the figurai element of art in the Pacific with the term 'template' (cf. Morphy 1991; Scoditti 1990). Templates' are taken to capture the tech- nical and material means which secure the generativity and reproductivity of artworks and to involve geometric and mathematical specifications of some kind, such as the graphic lay- out and geometric design of 'fore- and 'back-ground' in Australian Aboriginal barkpainting, or the mathematically precise refiguration of the body in Kula canoe-prows. The problem with the term template is that it is drawn from mechanical modes of reproduction, notably the printing press and as such embraces notions of linear, homogeneous, separate and local frames of space-time symptomatic of Newtonian physics. The mechanistic world-view, however, is at odds with the 'organic' description of space-time which appears adequate in capturing Melanesian conceptions of events as inseparable, observer contingent and process dependent, and as framed by non-linear, heterogeneous, multi-dimensional space-times (cf. Munn 1986; Strathern 1990). Indeed, such an 'organic' view of the universe is not just an adequate description of Pacific concepts of space-time, but given validity in the West with the advent of Einstein's relativity theory. Einstein's world broke up Newton's universe of absolute space and time into a multitude of space-time frames each tied to a particular observer, who therefore, not only has a different clock, but a different map. Quantum theory, moreover, demanded that we stop seeing things as separate solid objects with definite locations in space and time. Instead, they are delocalised, indefinite, mutually entangled entities that evolve like organ- isms (cf. Ho 1998, 44; Barrow 1992; Wassmann 1994). The inadequacy , and should we say 'datedness', of the term template and thus of exist- ing descriptions of the figurai in art in terms of a mechanistic description thus hardly needs further elaboration. It suggests that the formal properties of artworks are fixed by a techni- cal code which is learned as an aspect of esoteric knowledge, and implies in its mechanical description an ego-centric and anthropomorphic spatial cognition that is at odds with its conception in culture (cf. Wassmann 1994). Yet what term, and what set of assumptions, could replace this obviously misleading term? This question was raised also by the evolving New Genetics which found itself unable to comprehend the structure of DNA as a dynamic and evolving, 'organic' system as long as it relied on the notion of template as descriptive vocabulary. In our search for a new model, we may consider following New Genetics which recently began to look towards the science of topology, a branch of mathematics which developed as computing allowed for the visualisation of the behaviour of non-linear, organ- 146</page><page sequence="3">Kuchler ic space-time. The conceptual key to topology is the geometric constancy of objects under deformation which topology sees best exemplified by the behaviour of the knot. The appeal of the knot as a model for self-organising, non-linear systems reverberated over the last twenty years not just in science, but also in the humanities (Piaget and Inhelder 1967; Laing 1970; Lacan 1977; Serres 1995). It is this ubiquitous presence of the knot in contemporary academic thought which, I would argue, shaped the resonances evoked by recent analyses of the figurai in Pacific art. I am thinking here of MacKenzie's (1991) acclaimed research on looping technologies in Papua New Guinea and Valeri's (1985) account of binding in Hawaii. These studies point to the fact that the knot is not just the sin- gularly most important means of fastening across the Pacific, but works as knowledge tech- nology which enables the externalisation of concepts, from sorcery to affinity, into a spatial medium (cf. Levinson 1992). When we rethink what still is present as mechanistic accounts of technique in these analyses in terms of a notion of a cultural topology, MacKenzie's (1991:6) insight into the consistent application of alternative modes of binding - surfacing on the one hand in the loop in Non-Austronesian speaking cultures in the Pacific, and on the other hand in the knot in Austronesian speaking cultures - takes on a new significance. Is it possible, one begins to ask, that the non-random distribution of distinctively bound representations across the Pacific is indicative of diverse models of spatio-temporal relations? Could the spread of binding in its different logical articulations have facilitated the regional integration of diverse politico-religious institutions ? The full answer to these questions would demand a much more extensive excursion into Pacific art and society than is possible in the space of an essay. For this reason I will limit myself to the re-examination of malanggan ritual art from New Ireland in Papua New Guinea. By sketching its position in the wider field of looped and knotted representations in the Pacific, questions will emerge that will enable us to rethink the relation between art and society in the Pacific. BINDING IN THE PACIFIC From Polynesia to the Non-Austronesian speaking cultures of mainland Papua New Guinea, binding appears not just as technique resonating in everyday tasks from building to repair- ing bridges, houses and containers of all kinds, but also as artwork. Yet despite this almost trivial and commonsensical presence of binding, the manipulation of string and the visual and formal properties of products of binding varies from place to place, with the most pro- nounced differentiation emerging between what we call 'looping' and 'knotting' technolo- gies. Looping involves the pulling of the string through the knot, creating an expandable mesh which draws attention visually and conceptually to the threaded string and its continu- ous run. Knotting, on the other hand, creates a planar surface which covers the knot. The knot, compared with the loop, is only visible when unravelled, thus drawing visually and conceptually attention to a negative, absent space. While we might be readily inclined to compare examples of looped string with those of knotted string, carved malanggan-f igures from the North of New Ireland never before were associated with binding (Plate 1). In fact, however, the liminal position of open-work carving between the loop and the knot enables us to draw attention to the dynamic relation between the figurai and the social in Pacific art. Knots and artefacts composed of knots are of paramount importance to the fashioning of contractual relations across Polynesian island cultures. Famous are Tongan barkcloth (gatu vagatoga) figuring prominently in ceremonial gift exchanges as the inalienable prop- erty of chiefly lineages; the surface pattern of these mats is the result of the rubbing of bark- cloth over a net spanned across the kupeti-board (Koojiman 1977). Yet it is possibly Babadzan's (1993) exposition on the Tahitian to' o which illustrates most succinctly the con- ceptual purchase of artefacts of knotting. 147</page><page sequence="4">Binding in the Pacific Plate 1 .

At all times, bar the ritual at which to yo were revealed to view, such tightly knotted bindings encompassed a pillar that kept apart and thus connected heaven and earth and thus invested to' o with the god's pres- ence by virtue of contiguity rather than resemblance. The to yo, amalgams of ranked images, were thus embodiments of Oro, the Tahitian god, and control over them was essential to the system of social rank and political power. The correlation between the ranked polity of images and social rank among human beings was given regular and formal expression in a ritual called pa'iatua, which , translated, means the 'wrapping of the gods' (Babadzan 1993; Geli 1998:111). No one has as yet better revealed the importance ascribed in Polynesian culture to bind- ing and to the knotted cord as representation of binding (evidenced in Babadzan's work on Tahiti) than Valeri in his work on the king's sacrifice in Hawaii (1985:296-300). In Hawaii, a sacred cord ("aha) acted as the reference point of genealogy - representing not just the king's relationship with the gods, but also the connecting force of genealogy that 'binds together all other genealogies, since it is their reference point and the locus of their legitimacy and truth. '(Valeri 1985:296). The cord of Hawaiian kingship was not inherited - the undoing of the King's sacred cord dissolving the social bond embodied by the king. The strands obtained from the undoing of the cords were woven into caskets in which the bones of the king are enshrined (Valeri 1985:298). During the king's reign, the knotting of the cord which celebrat- ed his installation was re-enacted repeatedly as the central organising rite of the sacrifice of the king. The metaphoric or real 'twisting' of the strands that make up the 'aha cord enclosed and thereby removed from sight the space where the knot resides, containing and thus arrest- ing the divine powers which come to form the mystical body of kingship. Across Polynesia, artefacts of binding are thus also a means of wrapping and as such are powerfully associated with contexts and powers of revelation (cf. Geli 1993). Moving to Melanesia, the knot appears to vanish as an artefact of wrapping. This apparent displace- ment of binding, together with a decrease in emphasis on cloth wealth, appears marked even as one moves from the southern most islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, such as Vanuatu and the Solomons, to its northern most extensions in New Ireland and New Hanover. And yet, a much less obvious rendering of the knot as artefact can be found even in those parts of Melanesia that hitherto appeared to lie outside the parameters of Polynesian social sys- tems with their emphasis on the revelatory powers of the wrap and the ranking of lineages. Where carving from wood predominates in the ritual arts, such as in the North of New Ireland, the knot as the figurai frame for technical knowledge appears far fetched at first glance. Wood is a rigid substance, so much so that it is difficult to imagine a surface carved from wood as having the quality of stretchable rubber which allows one to image the twist- ing and tangling of string into a knot. That wood indeed lends itself for the technical explo- ration of knotting is revealed by the American artist Brent Collins whose work visualises a rather unusual explicit application of knot theory to wood (Plate 3). Many of his pieces dis- play invariant symmetrical relations and uniform thickness from which one can abstract closed, knotted and linked ribbons curving through space (Francis with Collins 1993:59). The mathematical surface depicted by his artworks indeed constitutes what he calls a 'knot- spanning surface' or a 'framed link,' with the knot literally being carved out of the wood and constituting the hollow, negative space of the sculpture. The entangling of carved planes, common to Collins' knot-sculptures, is strikingly reminiscent of the figurai qualities of malanggan from the North of New Ireland (cf. Plate 1). "Made as skins" (retak) to contain the life-force of the deceased persons prior to their final expulsion into the land of the dead, malanggan figures are not just visual renderings of knots but partake of the technical vocabulary and skill that is common to a range of knotted artefacts such as nets, both fish-nets and nets used as the base of head-dresses worn by malanggan-dzncers, and plaited artefacts such as mats and baskets. In fact, the northern 149</page><page sequence="6">Binding in the Pacific New Ireland term for knot, wu-ap, is associated phonetically and conceptually with the term for an image-based resource from which malanggan figures are derived which is wu-ne, meaning literally 'connected knots.' We know New Ireland largely through such malanggan artefacts which began to reach us in their many thousands with the early colonial explorations in the mid 19th century. Geographically and linguistically, the island forms in many ways a border between the mainland of New Guinea and the island Pacific region. Nearly 400km long, yet in part only 5km wide, the island forms the northern most extension of the Bismarck Archipelago whose volcanic islands dissect in a North-west to South-easterly direction the tectonic plate which connects the island of Papua New Guinea with Southeast Asia. Too far from the mainland to be reached by sea, yet not quite far enough to be seen as an independent entity historical- ly and politically speaking, New Ireland marks the most western extension of the archaeo- logical evidence of the Lapita Pottery culture whose contemporary articulation is found in a concern with tattooing and barkcloth technology that spans most of Polynesia. Though barkcloth is no longer produced on the island today, artefacts made out of barkcloth were collected in the latter part of the 19th century reminiscent of today's round, woven malang- gan known as warwara; this fact not only verifies that New Ireland is part of the cloth dom- inated cultural area of the wider Pacific, but also testifies to an unsuspected relation between malanggan and barkcloth technology. Before returning to investigating this rela- tion further, a brief ethnographic sketch of the malanggan may help to situate its culture at the cross-roads of East and West. THE KNOT-SPANNING SURFACES OF MALANGGAN To this day, malanggan is a rare ethnographic example of a contemporary funerary ritual that culminates in the production, revelation and 'death' of effigies which are part of complex monumental architecture. The effigy when installed in a structure that is specifically erected for its display is thought to be alive, having been gradually animated during the process of its production. Like the effigies of kings in sixteenth century England, which matched or even eclipsed the dead body itself, the effigy is attended as though the dummy was the living per- son himself - being animated and subsequently allowed to die, thus allowing the deceased person's soul to achieve symbolic immortality.1 The height of malanggan ritual is the dra- matic revelation of the effigy inside its architectural structure, followed moments later by the symbolic activation of its death. What took often more than three months to prepare is over in an hour, the 'empty' 'remains' of effigies being taken to the forest to be left to decompose the same afternoon and the architectural structures being removed from sight.2 While strikingly similar in the treatment of the effigy as double, this is where any com- parison between malanggan and renaissance funerary statues must rest. Effigies which are created for the 'finishing of the dead' in the north of New Ireland are neither portraits of deceased persons, nor are they emblematic in character. Instead, these effigies serve as ves- sels for the transmission of names which are considered to be the source of an augmentable, regenerative life-force. Becoming an ancestor in the malanggan-cuiture, like elsewhere in Melanesia, means to become part of a complex system of names; that is, to become synony- mous with a vast resource of knowledge that is almost permanently silenced as the names of those who died are barred from utterance. The peculiarity in the case of malanggan is that names are 'found,' validated and transferred as images that are produced out of named 'sources' (wune). Names become skins as a result of being shaped into effigies, but they also become images through the effigy's anticipated death and disappearance from sight. The imagistic character of names in New Ireland enables names to be recalled or 'found' in a controlled fashion using mnemonic techniques which leave their imprint in the form given to effigies. The control authorised over the recall and recognition of ancestral names stands in stark 150</page><page sequence="7">Kuchler contrast to the image of involuntary remembering which in New Ireland is encapsulated in the image of bush spirits; 'rulruV who snatch human skin and appear in their disguise, haunt and trick the living with their sudden and momentous appearances and their seeming- ly affirmed identity. A malanggan effigy, on the other hand, instigates a search which is completed only as a fleeting moment of recognition; to find the name in a sculpted image is possible only by recognising the effigy as memory trace. The connection between the realm of the ancestral and the realm of the living is visibilized in the figurai properties of the effi- gy and is alluded to in a revelatory manner which we associate with cloth based cultures. Visually and conceptually, the figures recall a body wrapped in images which draw attention to bodily folds, contours and shape. Incised to the point of breakage, the emerging fretwork takes the forms of instantly recognisable motifs found in abundance in the physical and animate environment of the island culture which produces them . We can recognise in the carved and painted planes birds, pigs, fish and seashells which are depicted with such an accuracy and attention to detail that they appear almost life like; the same can be said for the figure set within the fretwork which appears to stare at the beholder with eyes that could hardly be more vivid. Surrealist artists, from well known figures such as Giacometti to oth- ers such as Brignioni, were attracted to these figures however not because of their life-like character, but because of the apparently ornamental and yet not quite self-evident nature of the shape given to the figures. Motifs appear enchained as figures stand inside the mouth of rock-cods, framed by many different kinds of fish that bite into limbs and chins, birds that bite into snakes and snakes into birds, and the skulls of pigs that appear to metamorphose into birds. Inner shapes appear enclosed by outer frames in ways which contest the apparent reality of what is depicted like a vision in a dream. One may be inclined to suggest that these figures look like story boards visualising myths of potential importance to the understanding of this culture. In fact, such stories exist and are quite readily provided to those connoisseurs or tourists seeking to purchase them as a memento of their island experience. In a search for meaning we direct our eyes away from the hollowed spaces clustering between figure and frame. Yet, one may wonder about these hollowed spaces and indeed, it is here in what is rendered absent through incising that we find a surprising clue of what may count as a description of what a malanggan is: what we are looking at are complex knot-spanning surfaces reminiscent of the string-figures which form a beloved pastime across the Pacific. The finding of a knot in the hollowed spaces of the wood distinguishes ritually effec- tive artifacts from those which are considered 'mistakes' - the space framed by the enveloping planes of the carving calls to mind the heap of wood-chips left at the back of the carvers hut, called rotap , literally 'salty rubbish' likened to the dead, uprooted trees which drift ashore once a year from the direction of ancestral lands . The knot which is visible as negative space reflects thus upon a connection with an ancestral domain that is created through ritualised forgetting, one that is kept at bay at all costs (cf. Babadzan 1993). If a carved knot can in this way be seen to call up what is absent through the creation of negative space, a contrast emerges with the emphasis on life in line, pattern and colour common to string and looping cultures which predominate on the mainland of Papua New Guinea (MacKenzie 1991; Hauser-Schàublin 1987). Hauser-Scháublin described the experi- ence of ancestral power among the Abelam as captured by the brilliance of the line and the initiant's nettle beaten body - an embodiment of ancestral power which appears subversive from the perspective of New Ireland where any claim to personal control over ancestral power is considered deeply ambiguous and possible only under the guise of ritualised acts of negation (cf. Wagner 1987). The knot which, like all wrappings, exists only to be opened calls to mind the impossibility of containing and thus experiencing ancestral power which is effective only as long as it remains distanced and yet 'recollectable' by covering it in sec- ondary 'skins' whose removal, rotting and re-fabrication inscribe the ancestral domain in cycles of movement and arrest. 151</page><page sequence="8">Binding in the Pacific Knots are found in many contexts in New Ireland culture, all having in common that they serve as a means of 'binding' in more than just a functional sense. There are knotted stems of the gingerplant which are tied around trees in the forest to demarcate land taken out of cultivation for certain periods of time; usually coinciding with the death of a land- holding person, the tying and un-tying of the knot marks the transition of land-ownership that is associated with the right to taboo (dang) the land in this manner. There are also nets knotted across the front of certain houses which are the dwellings of the living dead known as 'haio9 or 'the caught ones,' who incorporate the knowledge that connects the living to the dead. There are nets worn on the head of malanggan dancers, alone able to finish the death of a haio by recapturing her life-force, who draw with their movements knotted patterns into the sand which disappear as quickly as they appear. And there are knots tied rhythmi- cally into songs classified as malanggan, and fishnets which are knotted and used only with the strictest observance of taboos to avoid the splitting of the netting. Not to forget are bas- ketry and mat-work whose plaits interlope in ways recalled by the intersecting planes of sculpted and woven malanggan - all made not to invite introspection, but to deflect it. The negative space of the malanggan-ñgure or the invisible underside or inner-layer of mats and baskets recall an ancestral realm that is positioned beyond the horizon in a land called Karoro. Expelled into the land of the dead, the ancestral remains attached to the liv- ing by means of the tangled planes of wood and the twisted leaves of the coconut palm whose seasonal drifting ashore announces the new year of the agricultural calendar. In the same way as magic is needed for the pulling ashore of what is colloquially termed the 'smell' of the dead (wangam a musung) in the form of uprooted trees and branches, so the creation of 'skins' carved into wood or bound into coconut leaves which visually and con- ceptually bind the ancestral to the living cannot be secured by skilled acts alone. The knot which traps the ancestral as it returns to the land of the living has to be found (seen -kalymi) in dreams. Being able to artificially induce or otherwise voluntarily effect the dreaming of an image that is able to capture the 'smell' (ngusung) of the dead distinguishes carvers (the 'joiners of skin' - retak) from others who may own knots in the form of named images, but cannot render them effective.3 The contractual relation between the living and the dead that is symbolised by the knot- ted planes of the malanggan- figure, also extends to land. Thus a contrast emerges with the Polynesian material on knotted artworks: while the sennit binding of the Tahitian to' o does not appear to have been made to symbolically underwrite a contract over land made between the living, this is certainly the case with malanggan. Like the looped netbags of mainland New Guinea, a malanggan-figure is always made for someone who stands in a particular social relation to the current owner of the image. In being made to be sold (sorolis), or lent (aradem) to affines or even clan-members who may live in different villages or even dialect groups as affirmation of a contract over usufructury rights over land, a malanggan- figure moves at least notionally every time it is made. Again like a netbag, a figure connects those who made and those who receive the art- work in that the complex, intertwining planes of a malanggan-figuxt are revealing the mem- ory of contractual relations over land. As rights to land are shared and fluid across linguistic and spatial boundaries, so the right to carve images that evoke such rights are shared; peo- ple talk about the 'path' (selen) of a named image which flows like a river from a source (wune). Such a 'path' is at least partially discernible and reconstructable as malanggan-ñg- ures document the conceptual and actual fragmentation of images in reproduction as they are shared out into smaller and smaller bits along ever expanding pathways, only occasion- ally to be reassembled into larger, more complete assemblages. There are two techniques of creating 'fractal,' or breakable figures, each associated with distinct contractual relationships: 'breakable' not just in the metaphorical sense as points of breakage suggested by the intersections of knotted planes may be targeted when severing a figure after it served to inform a contract between groups who each take home 152</page><page sequence="9">Kuchler one part as reminder of the relation thus effected. Each technique makes use of the knot in different ways; one to render different kinds of knots in the planes carved from wood, of which there are three main named types, and the other to trace the deformation of a knot into its possible forms. Elsewhere (Kuchler and Melion 1991) I have pointed to the impor- tance of motifs and motif combinations as tracing the spatio-temporal structure of the ritual process itself and marking it as sacrificial in nature: images of absorption foreshadow images of containment and beyond that of decomposition and transcendence. It is, however, the technique of carving surface spanning knots from wood which explains how images are generated and reproduced from an ever changing and yet fixed repertoire which allows the instantaneous recognition of the named 'source' from which an image is derived. The processuality of ritual itself may be derivative of the process of knotting which suggests the opening, severing and dissolution of whatever has been connected. This method of creating 'telling' variations in the material forms of malanggan is used for the six named image 'sources' of malanggan, which are in turn paired into three sets of two. As over 15,000 artifacts have been collected in mainly just six villages over the last hundred years, and the number of actually produced artifacts may be double that, one can easily predict that variations in form will be minute, a suggestion that any collection, how- ever small or scantily sampled, supports. Like the sound of the names which are chanted when a figure is seen for the first and often only time, or the steps which are traced on the ground when a dance is learned, the knotted shape of a figure contracts, expands and entan- gles to create for a fleeting moment a container for a knowledge that is tantamount to a tes- timony - you know what you have seen. In behaving like looped artefacts in underscoring reproductive metaphors and relations, yet visually and conceptually alluding to the necessary distancing of the ancestral by means of knotting, the case of malanggan- figures falls awkwardly within the neat opposition of the loop and the knot. Yet it is precisely this non-fit which draws attention to the dynamic which keeps looping and knotting as cultural representations within distinct social and his- torical fields. THE KNOT AND THE LOOP: THE DIFFERENTIATION OF BINDING IN THE PACIFIC Studies of knots as material renderings of binding in figurai, cord-like or patterned form, are surprisingly rare in Oceanic ethnography, despite the prominence of an allied technology known as looping whose conceptual force was recently uncovered by MacKenzie (1991) for the non-Austronesian speaking cultures of the mainland of Papua New Guinea. MacKenzie's study of netbags showed more than any previous ethnography the intimate link between a technique of binding, in this case that of 'looping', and the externalisation and management of knowledge. Her study shows netbags to work as a vehicle of ideas that identify spatio-temporal frames with the continuity of the string whose continuous run forms the body of the ubiquitous 'bilum.' Hauser-Schàublin (1996) recently extended this examination of string-based cultural imagination to concerns with the line and the frond in Sepik River figurai art, while arguing for an emerging revelatory 'aesthetic' that is diametri- cally opposed to the emphasis on the plait and the plane in island Melanesia and Polynesia. Even if we do not want to agree with her identification of the string as 'non-cloth' cultural 'aesthetics,' her study is of profound importance for a study of binding in the Pacific as it suggests a complex and yet systematic contrast between looping and knotting as allied and yet mutually opposed knowledge technologies. Mathematically speaking, the difference between the loop and the knot lies in their exe- cution only, one being literally the flip-side of the other. As Adams summarises succinctly in his introduction to knot-theory, the knot is a knotted loop of string, except that we think of the string as having no thickness, its cross-section being a single point.4 The knot is then a closed curve in space that does not intersect itself anywhere., the most basic of which is 153</page><page sequence="10">Binding in the Pacific the circle or 'un-knot'. While the knot thus lives in the space visualised by a surface, the loop is the surface of intersecting planes. Returning to my initial considerations of the nature of 'template,' the consideration of the contrast between knotting and looping technologies in the Pacific opens a new, surpris- ing perspective: it appears as if indeed the mechanical description of a template as a tech- nique for reproducing discrete space-time frames within fixed locales is quite apt for an account of looped material culture, yet not for the material renderings of knots, and that we are therefore not dealing with an albeit vanishing, difference between 'us' and 'them', but with different, though mutually interdependent ways of framing knowledge. The contrast between the types of binding is brought into sharper relief by considering the differences in the description of each. Looped netbags as described by MacKenzie (1991) come in a range of numerous dif- ferent, yet largely 'fixed' and localised 'styles,' with bags being defined in terms of differ- ent functions associated with the size, texture and finish of each item. Single cultural areas such as the Telefol, as described by MacKenzie (1991:46-51), distinguish twenty-seven named types of net-bags, and sub-types which are grouped into two categories (large flexi- ble 'bilums' and small tightly looped 'bilums') and a further five sub-categories (mouth- band 'bilum', father 'bilum', pocket 'bilum', twin 'bilum', red seed 'bilum'). The persis- tence of such categories as well as the techniques which are associated with them broadly frame regional and intra-regional boundaries, as both the bags as well as the technique of looping associated with them are transmitted along affinal paths. As the construction process and the resulting form of the bilum is inseparable from the selected looping tech- nique, a variation in the technique has obvious stylistic consequences. Most important, however, is MacKenzie's observation that technique is learned through observation and imi- tation, a process that is initiated in early childhood. In stark contrast to the mechanical description of looping as a technique of binding, knotted artefacts are 'seen' and described in terms of figurai topologies which emphasise a dynamics of ordering inherent in the patterned design of binding. Given the emphasis on a visually mediated 'knowing' or understanding of designs which is acquired through 'dream- ing', the execution of knotted forms is not restricted to those who have acclaimed 'rights' to designs. As we saw in the example of malanggan, the ownership of a design can be sold, lend or otherwise transmitted, with one carver being hired across the region. As the techni- cal execution of the design is subordinate to the resulting pattern in these knotted artworks, variation of technique is less frequent and indeed even avoided as this could enhance the possibility that designs are confused and theft allegations are brought forth. The variability of design in knotted artefacts is thus governed by factors other than the conditions influencing the transmission of skill based technique. In fact, as pointed out ear- lier with reference to the practice of carving 'fractal' images in New Ireland, the variability of design is a direct consequence of the embeddedness of the design in contractual relations over land which are visually and metaphorically tied into the tangled planes of the malang- gan-figure. The 'knotted' planes of malanggan figures in New Ireland thus command to be per- ceived as a geometric configuration in order for execution to produce acceptable results. In comparison with looped netbags, malanggan figures come in limited shapes, sizes, and motifs with an emphasis on their combination that remains constant throughout the north of the island while allowing for infinite variability at the level of 'surface' design such as in the painted patterns and painted or carved, attached motifs. The stability of pattern is the result of the subordination of technique to the spatial framing of the image. Rather than 'finding' the design of the figure in the wood during carving, the geometric contours of the image are drawn on sand or onto the wood that is used for carving, thus allowing improved or innovative techniques of fabrication only minimal scope to influence the resulting prod- uct. It is this geometric design of a malanggan which is owned and exchanged in the north 154</page><page sequence="11">Kuchler of New Ireland, quite unlike the New Guinea netbag described by MacKenzie (1991) which is validated in terms of its technical execution and exchanged as artefact. The emphasis on the configuration of design rather than its execution also explains the frequently lamented decline in the degree of visual open-work in malanggan; noted as neg- ative by the western connoisseur who measures aesthetic appeal in terms of skilful execu- tion, the decreasing three-dimensionality of carving does not bother anyone in New Ireland as even a sketched, more or less painted design would do if time and attention is demanded for tasks other than the preparation of feasting.5 At the same time, figures are seen as belonging to the same 'source' or knot-type, even if one is executed in wood and the other in fibre and even if place and time of execution are unconnected. Making such comparisons, which are by definition unverifiable as the artefact is destroyed or sold subsequent to its use in ritual, implies that the experience to which refer- ence is made lies outside the making of ritual artworks in the mundane tasks of binding. Yet should we imagine people walking around with an abstract image of a knot in their heads, its different types and possible deformations, which then just get projected onto a given medium? Or should we imagine that pattern is deduced from the structures inherent in the practical operation of knotting? These quite plausible solutions to the problem of pattern production and recognition ignore an aspect of pattern that has become known as self- organisation whose explanation has become crucial to the modelling of non-mechanistic biology (Saunders 1998:55). Confronted with the evidence of non-linear systems which are capable of self-organisation, Lovelock (1989) recently proposed that what appears as self- regulation is a co-ordinated phenomenon arising from causes that are themselves co-ordi- nated and purposeful. An overall 'design' thus does not have to be in existence, while the system itself has to be inherently co-ordinated and purposeful, ascribing thereby autonomy and agency to non-linear organic systems compared with the dependency on external forces as suggested in the mechanical description of systems. Lifted out of biology to the world of material culture, the notion of co-ordination and purpose throws a new light on the poignancy of the knot as metaphor of generative systems. The knot might be argued to work as 'source' not because it is comprehended in terms of a quasi pre-existing mathematical and spatially decentered system of ordering, but because it is a trace of purposeful co-ordination And it is here, in being a trace of purposeful co-ordi- nation that the loop and the knot meet, diverging 'merely' in the relative importance ascribed to either technical process or pattern in the generative reproduction of things. Following the insights of new biology, however, each manner of co-ordination, the mecha- nistic and the organic, would bring with it associated space-time frames which in turn would create a difference in culture and society. Turning back to the distribution of looped and knotted artworks in the Pacific we note with MacKenzie (1991) the neat overlapping of the two sides of binding with the spread of non-Austronesian and Austronesian speaking cultures. One may be reminded of Whitney Davis's (1986) argument in his 'origin of image-making' that images originate from mark- making, not from pre-existing concepts that are 'projected' onto materials. The story of the loop and knot may support his case and provide a new perspective on the epidemiology of cultural representations: one that draws attention to the mundane, affective, personal and yet profoundly mathematical nature of binding which shapes ways of thinking.

One is reminded of Howes (1988) poignant insight into the correspondence of a cultural emphasis on olfaction with a conceptual displacement of the dead from the realm of the living and its distinct patterns of distribution across the Pacific. I would add to this the corresponding amplification of knotting as 'cognitive style' common to socio-political institutions that grow out of the 'the finishing' or expulsion of the dead. 155</page><page sequence="12">Binding in the Pacific 4.

It is, however, noted as a 'sad' consequence of the constraints of modern life as this makes figures much less attractive to the western buyer. REFERENCES ADAMS, C. 1994.
