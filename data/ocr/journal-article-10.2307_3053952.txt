<plain_text><page sequence="1">741 Legislating Organizational Probation: State Capacity, Business Power, and Corporate Crime Control William S. Lofquist This study examines the development of organizational probation. That this sanction emerged from the long process of developing organizational sentencing guidelines as a clearly specified, widely available, and often bind- ing sanction represents an unexpected statutory outcome: an interventionist, nonmarket sanction during a time of deregulatory free market policy and ide- ology. This outcome is explained through a multi-theoretical framework em- phasizing the structural capacity of the primary lawmaking agency, the United States Sentencing Commission, the role of middle-level state workers, and the bounded rationality of strategic decisions made by business strate- gists and lobbyists. QO^ 1 November 1991 the United States Sentencing Com- mission's guidelines for organizational sentencing became law. This marked the culmination of a 25-year effort to develop and specify statutory sentencing standards for individuals and orga- nizations.' With this and other recent statutory changes,2 the state is more "potently armed" to control corporate crime than ever before (Obermaier 1992). Included in the federal sentenc- ing guidelines are binding and nonbinding (known as policy statements) standards for use by federal judges in imposing fines, restitution, community service, notice to victims, and probation on corporations and other organizations convicted of crimes. Although the full impact of these sanctions is contin- gent on enforcement efforts, and will certainly be less extensive An earlier version of this article was presented at the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences Annual Meetings, Pittsburgh, March 1992.

For critical discussions of them, see Champion 1989; Savelsberg 1992. 2 These changes include substantial increases in the availability of corporate criminal liability (see Cohen 1992; Adler &amp; Lord 1991; Corporate Crime Reporter 1989; Bernard 1984; Brickey 1984; Orland 1980; Thornburgh 1991) and in statutory maxi- mum fines (Criminal Fine Improvements Act of 1987).

Organizational probation, which authorizes defendant- designed and court-monitored and approved organizational changes, marks a watershed for corporate crime control. Prior to the organizational sentencing guidelines, there was almost exclusive reliance on market-based sanctions. Organizational probation was possible only under provisions of a statute in- tended for individuals.3 Now, probation is the primary alterna- tive to fines, offering not only an additional sanction but also a remedial potential not found in deterrence-based fines. All its specified uses are mandatory, as are several of its conditions. Among the available conditions are development of compli- ance plans, accompanied by detailed directions for organiza- tional changes to implement these plans (see Table 1 below). This provides the potential for a more intrusive and demand- ing approach to corporate crime control. Considerable dis- tance has been traveled sinceJustice Douglas declared that cor- porations' "liabilities whether criminal or civil can be effected only by the payment of money" (Melrose Distillers v. United States 1959:274). Moreover, this movement toward enhanced organi- zational interventions came despite business and White House opposition, and during an era of substantial political and popu- lar support for free market ideology and policy (Lipset &amp; Schneider 1987; Phillips 1990). This article examines the development of organizational probation through the frameworks provided by state and socio- legal theories, as well as by organizational theory. In so doing, I use the details of a case study of the development of the sen- tencing guidelines to address and contribute to issues central to these disciplines. I examine instrumentalist, structuralist, and class struggle conceptualizations of the state, specifically relations between the state and capital. Of particular interest are the conditions under which state actors pursue courses of action contrary to the interests of business elites, the circum- stances that enable success in these efforts, the specific hierar- chical and governmental locations of these actors, and the ra- tionality of business and state actors. The findings presented here do not test any particular the- ory but rather represent an effort to enhance our understand- ing of corporate lawmaking and state-capital relations more generally by highlighting underdeveloped points of existing theories.

My research finds some support for these perspectives, though none is sufficient to explain the de- velopment of organizational probation. Rather than deriving my analysis primarily or exclusively from any single force, I have identified several theoretical perspectives. This raises the point, particularly important in detailed case studies, that "dif-</page><page sequence="4">744 Legislating Organizational Probation ferent theories ... may well be not mutually exclusive but com- plementary and sequentially compatible, especially when seen from a historical perspective" (Heydebrand 1990:494). As detailed in the discussion here, organizational probation developed at the confluence of four circumstances: (1) substan- tial state autonomy and capacity provided to and expanded on by the Sentencing Commission; (2) vigorous and policy-specific regulatory agency lobbying for organizational probation; (3) the Sentencing Commission's organizational legitimacy con- cerns; and (4) strategic considerations and bounded rationality on the part of business.4 The intersection of these forces al- lowed the traditional market-based limits of corporate crime control to be transcended through the creation of a binding, interventionist corporate criminal sanction. It is notable that even under these circumstances, which were uniformly favorable for law creation, organizational probation was en- acted only after more vigorously opposed organizational fining provisions were scaled back. This suggests that capacity and opportunities to legislate expanded state controls over busi- ness are substantially circumscribed by business lobbying and free market ideology. In detailing the interrelationships of these forces, and elab- orating the theoretical perspectives underlying them, I advance several points of theoretical importance. First, the multiplicity of state actors, and the extent to which their interests and goals diverged and even conflicted in this case, contributes to the more complex and less monolithic conception of "the state" in lawmaking (Schmitter 1985) that has emerged from state-cen- tered social policy analyses. I focus not only on executive branch groups, as is often the case (Sanders 1990), but also on legislative and judicial actors, various strata of actors through- out government, and the hybrid U.S. Sentencing Commission (see Table 2). State actors from each branch of government were active in the present case, including elected and ap- pointed organizational elites and top civil servants (state man- agers), as well as middle-level staff personnel (state workers). Some of these actors, particularly middle-level regulatory, con- gressional, and Department of Justice personnel, exercised considerable autonomy. Their efforts substantially influenced the final organizational probation provisions. State managers, on the other hand, were closely tied to business interests, and exercised little leadership or imagination in approaching cor- porate crime control. This pattern of staff commitment to organizational goals 4 Due to the unity of business lobbying throughout the development of federal organizational sentencing guidelines, "business" is referred to here as a single entity. Business groups presented a singular position, with only the most minor deviations. Later discussion elaborates this point.</page><page sequence="5">Lofquist 745 and elite attention to political and business interests is much like what has been found in recent research on federal environ- mental criminal law enforcement (Environmental Crimes Pro- ject 1992). It contrasts, however, to some degree with other empirical and theoretical work in this area, particularly that of Block (1977, 1987), by locating the primary impetus for ex- panded state power in the middle of the state power structure, among civil servants, rather than among their superiors or soci- etal groups (see Skocpol 1980; Skocpol &amp; Finegold 1982). Block identifies state managers as "those at the peak of the ex- ecutive and legislative branches of the state apparatus" (1987:201 n.9) and suggests that their occupational roles alter their views toward favoring increased state power, even if they are only "on loan" from the private sector. I suggest, rather, that state managers retain close ties to business and antiregu- latory constituencies. Through their behind-the-scenes actions and their careful construction of state capacity and autonomy, these state workers put in place state structures that served as constraints on the efforts of state managers to respond to the demands of business. These conclusions suggest the need to further specify and accommodate the complexity of state actors and state interests involved in lawmaking. Second, limitations on the rationality of parties involved in this case of lawmaking suggest that socioloegal theory should be more attentive to organizational theory. Parties in lawmak- ing may act on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate under- standings of the lawmaking process or of the issues at stake. Despite these parties' resources and their interest in shaping a favorable legal environment, their rationality may be bounded by the complexity of proposed legislation, the misinterpreta- tion of new concepts, and incorrect assumptions about other parties' future actions. There is clear evidence that business groups misunderstood what it means to place an organization on probation and misjudged the actions of Congress and the Sentencing Commission at several points in the two-decade- long process of constructing sentencing guidelines. Sociolegal theorists, particularly those advancing corporate liberalism, have difficulty incorporating such circumstances due to the central role of rationality in their explanations. Assuming ra- tionality becomes untenable in a lawmaking environment as complex and novel as that which led to the development of or- ganizational sentencing guidelines. Third, this study suggests that the common distinction be- tween law in the books and law in action may be overdrawn. Lawmaking and law enforcement are not discrete phases in the enactment of law. Rather, assumptions about future enforce- ment practices influence the actions of parties in lawmaking, leading to legislative changes that impact the actions of subse-</page><page sequence="6">746 Legislating Organizational Probation Table 2.

The widespread belief that the state lacks the capacity and willingness to enforce organizational criminal laws (Hagan 1989; Pontell 1982, 1992)-a belief borne out by past practice (Yeager 1987, 1991)-led to actions by business that allowed the state to more tightly couple offense and sentencing stat- utes, thereby increasing the state's enforcement capacity. This was accomplished by reducing judicial discretion in sentencing organizations. After discussing the research design for this case study and providing an overview of the histories of organizational sen- tencing and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, I elaborate each of these theoretical points through case materials. In the final section, I use this case to inform and expand existing sociolegal</page><page sequence="7">Lofquist 747 theoretical explanations of corporate criminal lawmaking and enforcement. Research Design: Elaborating the Case Study The Sentencing Commission is the product of a lengthy lawmaking effort. Documentary sources pertaining to its devel- opment include the records of the Brown Commission (Na- tional Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws 1970a, 1970b, 1971), which initiated the federal criminal law reform effort, and Congress (see, in particular, U.S. Senate 1977, 1983; U.S. House of Representatives 1980), which created the Sentencing Commission in 1984. However, these documents make only brief mention of organizational sentencing, and even less of organizational probation. The vast majority of leg- islative attention focused on politically attractive issues, such as individual sentencing, the death penalty, obscenity, and drug- related issues. The documentary record of the Sentencing Commission is far richer. It includes five public hearings on organizational sanctioning, organizational sentencing proposals drafted by the Commission and outside parties, hundreds of written commen- taries submitted to the Commission in response to these pro- posals, the minutes of its meetings, and the organizational sen- tencing data base it developed.5 I reviewed this entire documentary record for materials relevant to organizational probation. I also made numerous written requests for informa- tion, resulting in receipt of documentary materials and letters detailing the positions of particular individuals and interest groups on different issues. I also selectively employed federal court cases involving or- ganizational probation to assess the use of this sanction under the Federal Probation Act (FPA), the governing statute prior to the sentencing guidelines. Finally, to supplement these docu- mentary records, I completed 28 interviews with individuals from each interest group and from each historical period in the development of organizational probation. Each interview was conducted after the Commission's final guidelines were submit- ted to Congress. Simultaneous use of documentary and inter- view sources provides a valuable means to assess each party's real-time and after-the-fact assessments of the development of organizational probation. These materials were supplemented 5 Transcripts of hearings, minutes of meetings, draft proposals, and correspon- dence from individuals and interest groups are on file with the Sentencing Commission at its offices in Washington, DC.

Despite the emergence of law and economics and its advocacy of sole reliance on fines (Becker 1968; Posner 1980; Parker 1988), there is a growing sense that the state is underequipped in responding to corpo- rate crime and that alternatives to fines are needed. Proposals calling for federal chartering of corporations (Conley 1977; Na- der 1973), changes in the composition of boards of directors (Stone 1975), adverse publicity of offenders (Fisse 1971; Fisse &amp; Braithwaite 1983), equity fines (Coffee 1981, 1990b), com- munity service (Fisse 1981; Yeager 1984; Abel 1985), corporate social responsibility (Stone 1975; Engel 1979), enforced self- regulation (Braithwaite 1982, 1985), and organizational proba- tion (Gruner 1988; Rush 1986; Curran 1986; Metzger &amp; Schwenk 1990), among the most prominent, have been pro- posed and debated. Legal policymakers have likewise given increased attention to alternatives to fines for controlling organizational crime. In 1966, Congress established the National Commission on Re- form of Federal Criminal Laws (Pub. L. No. 89-901), better known as the Brown Commission, to apply the Model Penal Code blueprint to the federal criminal law. In contrast to the Model Penal Code (American Law Institute 1962, 1985), which was inattentive to corporate crime, the Brown Commission in- troduced several novel alternatives into the organizational sen- tencing debate: publicity, notice to victims, and probation. For organizational probation, however, no definition or elaboration of how it was to be implemented was provided (National Com- mission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws 1970a, 1970b, 1971). Although the Brown Commission took the important step of recommending that probation for both individuals and organizations be made an independent and affirmative sen- tence, rather than a suspended sentence as had historically been the case, the conditions provided were only those tradi- tionally imposed on individuals. How probation would be ap- plied to organizations was not specified. Further development of this sanction was left to Congress and the courts.7 6 Most discussions of the organizational sentencing guidelines appeared in legal newspapers. Articles in scholarly journals are now beginning to appear (see Wray 1992; Zagrocki 1992; Etzioni 1993; Lofquist 1993). 7 Interviews with Louis B. Schwartz, Professor of Law, Hastings College of the Law, former Research Director, National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal</page><page sequence="9">Lofquist 749 After receiving the Brown Commission report, Congress immediately began consideration of criminal code reform legis- lation. Between 1971 and 1984, Congress held dozens of hear- ings, heard hundreds of witnesses, and considered 38 criminal code reform bills. This effort, of which organizational crime was only a small part, culminated with passage of the Sentenc- ing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984, title II of the larger Compre- hensive Crime Control Act. This legislation established organi- zational probation as the primary alternative to fines. However, legislative records make it clear that Congress opposed reme- dial organizational interventions through organizational proba- tion (U.S. Senate 1983; Wray 1992),8 except in the most ex- treme cases. Preference was expressed for use of probation as a means to monitor fine collection and community service. After reviewing the legislative history of organizational probation, Rush (1986:59) concluded: "Congress has tacitly rejected many invasive techniques while wholeheartedly adopting only noninvasive probation." Under these circumstances, business's attention was hardly even drawn to organizational probation. Like the Brown Commission, however, Congress did not de- velop specific statements elaborating the operational details of its sentencing standards. Rather, due to technical and political constraints, Congress delegated this task to an independent sentencing commission and to the courts.9 As a result, despite congressional concerns about invasive probation, limitations on the development and use of organiza- tional probation did not take clear statutory form. The limita- tions could only be found in the text of congressional reports. Although little specificity as to the uses of this sanction was provided in the statute, little enthusiasm for its development was evidenced. By establishing probation as the primary alter- native to fines, Congress laid the foundation for the statute's later development. State capacity to legislate organizational sentencing guidelines and to develop organization-specific uses of probation, though latent and largely unrecognized at the time, was established. This proved to be important when the Sentencing Commission, motivated in large part by organiza- tional legitimacy considerations deriving from the severity of its individual sentencing guidelines and criticisms of its organi- zational fine proposals, displayed an unexpected interest in or- ganizational probation.

Ronald Gainer, an As- sistant U.S. Attorney General during this period, recognized the importance of statutory authority for expanding state ca- pacity to control corporate crime. In describing the develop- ment of the SRA in the area of corporate crime, he asserted: "[W]e were trying ... as best we could to permit the most se- vere sorts of restrictions that conceivably could be appropriate so that a commission would have the widest reasonable range of latitude in determining appropriate penalties for different offenses."'0 Robert Blakey, a member of both the Brown Com- mission staff and the Senate Judiciary Committee staff, made a similar point regarding the work of the Senate: "There was a staff decision to continue the availability of probation, with the hope that the Sentencing Commission will develop it: 'we au- thorize it and we see what happens. We maximize people's op- tions.' "1 The Sentencing Commission took advantage of these efforts by focusing on its statutory mandate, and on the accompanying congressional debate. During the same period in which Congress was considering organizational sentencing reform, organizational probation re- ceived initial, infrequent, and unsystematic use in the federal courts. Judicial and congressional efforts to develop organiza- tional probation were initially unrelated, though subsequent legislative efforts were bolstered by judicial precedents. The first use of organizational probation was United States v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1971) (ARCO),12 an innovative and serendipi- tous13 extension of the FPA to organizations (see Baldwin 10 Interview with Gainer (see note 9). l l Interview with Blakey (see note 7). 12 The Federal Probation Act was passed in 1925. At the time, no thought was given to its applicability to organizations. Although it may have been applied to organi- zations prior to the ARCO case, no such cases have been identified by the many judges, lawyers, legal scholars, and other researchers active in this area. The FPA has since been superseded by the SRA. 13 The use of probation in the ARCO case was based on a misunderstanding of precedents by the presiding judge, James B. Parsons, Jr. Court records (United States v. Atlantic Richfield Co. 1971, 1972) and communications with Judge Parsons (letter to Lof- quist, 5 Aug. 1991; see Lofquist 1992) reveal that he believed organizational probation to be a commonly used criminal sanction. This became a point of considerable conten- tion with ARCO's attorney. The ARCO case appears to be the first federal use of orga- nizational probation, and only the second recorded attempt to use this sanction. A 1911 Missouri case was successfully appealed (State ex rel. Howell Countv). The source of this misunderstanding was Parsons's confusion of organizational probation with civil nonmonetary sanctions, such as consent decrees and cease and desist orders. However, these sanctions differ in several significant ways, particularly now that organizational sentencing guidelines have been established. Among the differences are the absence of clear statutory support for most civil interventions into organizations (Dent 1983; Far- rand 1976), the essentially prohibitory and nonremedial nature of civil sanctions (Clinard &amp; Yeager 1980), and the infrequency of their use on corporate organizations (for a more detailed discussion of the differences between organizational probation and nonmonetary civil sanctions, see Lofquist 1992: ch. 3).</page><page sequence="11">Lofquist 751 1974). Subsequently, organizational probation was imposed in numerous cases prior to the passage of the SRA. Although the ARCO case involved a remedial condition, such conditions were rarely used in subsequent cases under the FPA.'4 Probation was a "grace" that courts ruled organizational defendants had the right to refuse in favor of the original sentence (United States v. Mitsubishi Int'l Co. 1982), leading to frequent, and often suc- cessful, appeals (see Levin 1984; Gruner 1988). As a result, probation was relegated to nonintrusive uses, primarily in sup- port of fines. These cases revealed the weakness of the FPA and the importance of the types of statutory changes found in the SRA, particularly the establishment of organizational probation as an independent sentence. At the same time, this experience also points out the role of the judiciary and the juristic person standard as sources of progressive legal changes. Despite im- pediments to effective corporate crime control resulting from an anthropomorphic conception of organizations (see Fisse 1983; Friedman 1979), the European experience makes clear (see Laitinen 1991) that legislative efforts alone would not have led to the range of corporate criminal laws made possible by the juristic person standard. The U.S. Sentencing Commission and Organizational Probation The congressional criminal code reform debate, the SRA, and the final congressional report provided business a gener- ally favorable view of its legal future. Especially within the con- text of the regulatory climate that emerged in the early 1980s, there was little reason for business to believe that the U.S. Sen- tencing Commission would develop separate organizational sanctions, particularly organizational probation. Despite statu- tory authority for its development, the perfunctory nature of this authority, the weakness of its past uses, and, most impor- tant, the massive attention to individual sentencing in the crea- tion and early tenure of the Sentencing Commission made its development unlikely. Quite to the contrary, however, the U.S. Sentencing Commission gave organizational probation sus- tained attention and substantial development, fully exploiting the statutory foundation provided by Congress and largely ig- nored by business. This produced considerable controversy (Toensing 1990; Coffee 1990a), particularly after the final guidelines were enacted (Orland 1991a; Wray 1992; Cohen 1992). Again, shared assumptions about lawmaking and en- 14 The use of probation was appealed in the ARCO case. The appellate court up- held the imposition of probation on organizations but avoided ruling on the remedial condition (Baldwin 1974). This issue was made moot by remedial steps later taken by ARCO (United States v. Atlantic Richfield Co. 1971).</page><page sequence="12">752 Legislating Organizational Probation forcement produced vigor on the part of some state actors and complacency on the part of business. The Sentencing Commission's formal debate of organiza- tional sentencing began in the summer of 1988. In Discussion Materials on Organizational Sanctions published by the Commis- sion to facilitate this debate, two vastly different proposals were included. The first, developed by law professors John Coffee, Richard Gruner, and Christopher Stone ("the CGS proposal"; Coffee et al. 1988), was a detailed and interventionist organiza- tional probation proposal. On the other end of the spectrum was a law and economics proposal developed by Commissioner Michael Block and several staff members (U.S. Sentencing Commission 1988a; see also Parker 1987, 1988). This proposal advocated almost sole reliance on optimal fines based on eco- nomic harm, opposing organizational probation through sub- stantial, even insurmountable, barriers to its use. Outright re- jection of organizational probation was precluded by the SRA. In public hearings and written commentaries, the Block proposal's reliance on market logic and deterrence was sharply and widely criticized as excessively ideological, complex, nar- row, and incompatible with the Sentencing Commission's man- date15 (see U.S. Sentencing Commission 1988b, 1988c; U.S. House of Representatives 1990). It received support only among law and economics advocates (Baker 1988; U.S. Inter- national Trade Commission 1988; Domestic Policy Council 1988). Even business, which favored reliance on market-based sanctions, opposed the Block proposal (Business Roundtable 1988). However, this opposition did not translate into wide- spread support for the CGS proposal, which was advocated pri- marily by regulatory and academic witnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ), business groups, and the American Bar Asso- ciation (ABA), the most active participants in the organizational sentencing debate, favored a middle approach of limited pro- bation and multiple approaches to calculating fines (American Bar Association 1988; Business Roundtable 1986, 1988; U.S. Department of Justice 1989). The business community, led by the Business Roundtable,16 and the ABA also advocated ex- panded reliance on individual criminal liability. The Sentencing Commission responded to these criticisms by abandoning the Block proposal. This created substantial dis- ruptions within the Commission (see Yost 1989a; U.S. House of Representatives 1990) due to Block's dominance of Com- 15 The Sentencing Commission was mandated to develop guidelines that reduced disparity and promoted fairness (title 28, ? 991 (b)(l)) and that furthered deserts, de- terrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation (title 18, ? 3553 (a)(2)). 16 The Business Roundtable was founded in 1972. It is composed of executives from 200 Fortune 500 companies. The impetus for its development was concern about the inefficacy of business in public policymaking.</page><page sequence="13">Lofquist 753 mission efforts to develop organizational sentencing guidelines and the extensiveness of his investment in this project.17 In the first Commission-endorsed proposal, published in November 1989 (U.S. Sentencing Commission 1989), substantially in- creased fines (see Etzioni 1993) calculated through multiple methods were advocated. The proposed probation conditions provided for extensive judicial monitoring of fine payments and limited use of remedial probation. The Department ofJus- tice supported this proposal, though business strongly opposed the fining provisions and fine payment supervision as excessive. Regulatory and academic witnesses expressed support for in- clusion of good faith probation provisions but sought unambig- uous language regarding its implementation (U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency 1990; U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administra- tion 1990). In particular, they expressed interest in more spe- cific and extensive remedial probation conditions and regula- tory involvement in compliance monitoring. They showed little interest in the fine supervision probation provisions. Under intense business lobbying, culminating at a public hearing on 14 February 1990 at which business witnesses ex- pressed concern about increased fines, the Sentencing Com- mission backed off from its fining and fine-supervision propos- als. The next day, the Sentencing Commission met and adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to fines, characterized by high presumptive fines and generous mitigators for coopera- tion, presence of compliance plans, self-reporting, and several other factors (see Etzioni 1993). In draft proposals in which this approach first appeared, the use of remedial probation was also dramatically scaled back, to the point that none of its uses were mandatory and its imposition was discouraged (Gruner 1990). These were the weakest guidelines considered by the Commission; they were advanced just prior to the Commis- sion's vote on final organizational sentencing guidelines. None- theless, business remained opposed to them, believing it could defeat the effort to establish standards for organizational sanc- tioning. In April 1990, days before the scheduled vote, Commis- sioner George MacKinnon, a Republican, declared his unwill- ingness to vote to adopt organizational sentencing guidelines (U.S. House of Representatives 1990). Because of Commission vacancies,18 he believed that the composition of the Commis- 17 Since leaving the Sentencing Commission, Block has become an outspoken critic of the Sentencing Commission, accusing it of developing unprincipled, anticom- petitive, and intrusive organizational sentencing guidelines (Block 1990; Block &amp; Lott 1991). 18 Commissioner Block resigned after his proposal was rejected by the Commis- sion. Commissioner Robinson resigned in a dispute over the individual sentencing guidelines. Commissioner Breyer resigned at the end of his first term. None had been replaced as of April 1990.</page><page sequence="14">754 Legislating Organizational Probation sion did not meet statutory standards specified for promulgat- ing guidelines. Without MacKinnon's vote, the necessary quo- rum was lacking; further consideration of organizational sentencing guidelines was delayed until the 1991 legislative cy- cle.19 Although critics alleged that MacKinnon had been influ- enced by business and White House lobbying (U.S. House of Representatives 1990, Etzioni testimony), there is no evidence for this allegation. Rather, although business and White House lobbying apparently did persuade the Department ofJustice to withdraw its support for the guidelines in February 1990 (Isikoff 1990; Lewis 1990), MacKinnon acted independently and in the interest of strong guidelines (see Lofquist 1992; U.S. House of Representatives 1990). He reasoned that guidelines passed without a full complement of commissioners would be vulnerable to legal challenge, a particularly serious problem given the commitment of business to opposing the guidelines. Nonetheless, his actions increased scrutiny and criticism of an agency already hobbled by controversy. Three commissioners were nominated and approved in the summer of 1990. Soon after, the Commission began what would be its final push to promulgate organizational sentenc- ing guidelines. In a proposal published in November 1990, the carrot-and-stick fining scheme was retained but organizational probation was strengthened (U.S. Sentencing Commission 1990b). Mandatory uses and conditions of probation were in- creased. In later drafts circulated among participants in this de- bate, a detailed definition of a compliance plan was introduced, a move that strengthened probation by providing clear stan- dards for judges in assessing the adequacy of existing compli- ance plans and for probation officers20 in evaluating new com- pliance plans established by defendant organizations.21 Despite several last-minute efforts by business, the White House, and prominent members of Congress (see U.S. Sentencing Com- mission 1991a; Business Roundtable et al. 1991; Strasser 1991) to delay or prevent promulgation of guidelines, in April 1991 the Commission voted unanimously to submit a proposal to Congress. This proposal became law on 1 November 1991 19 The SRA established that the Sentencing Commission can propose guidelines and amendments any time between the opening of the congressional session and 1 May. Congress must then review these proposals for 180 days or more, ending no later than 1 Nov. (28 U.S.C. ? 994 (p)). 20 The Sentencing Guidelines provide for the use of regulatory personnel, court- appointed experts, or existing probation officers as organizational probation officers. 21 A growing body of evidence, linked theoretically to Braithwaite's discussion of republican criminology (Braithwaite &amp; Pettit 1990; Braithwaite 1992) and empirically to his concept of enforced self-regulation (Braithwaite 1982; Ayres &amp; Braithwaite 1992) suggests that a negotiative regulatory strategy is more effective than adversarial meth- ods. Organizational probation is consistent with this approach; it provides business the opportunity to design its compliance strategy, subject to court approval, oversight, and escalating penalties in cases of noncompliance.</page><page sequence="15">Lofquist 755 (U.S. Sentencing Commission 1991b), without congressional modification.22 While the fining provisions found in the final guidelines are widely viewed as more lenient than earlier proposals,23 though much harsher than past practice (Cohen 1992; Standen 1991; Block 1991), this same view does not extend to the probation provisions. These provisions are seen by many, including both probation advocates24 and opponents,25 as more intervention- ist and remedial than expected, given the SRA and the debate on organizational probation within the Sentencing Commis- sion. At most, nonbinding policy statements were expected; binding guidelines were issued. Narrow interventions were ex- pected; broadly available interventions were provided. The re- sult was a "clear victory" for probation supporters.26 Another commentator (Wray 1992:2017), critical of this outcome, noted: "Among the more controversial provisions is a broad corporate probation scheme that confers significant authority on federal courts to monitor convicted companies and to force them to develop internal programs to prevent and detect mis- conduct." Assumptions about enforcement capacity and com- mitment, reinforced by the history of organizational probation under the FPA, have limited academic, business, and political attention to this outcome.

I provide support for re- cently popular state-centered theories, but offer important provisos concerning the limiting influence of business actions on state lawmaking and the need to continue to elaborate the multiplicity and complexity of state interests and state actors in lawmaking. I also elaborate the role of bounded rationality in interest group lobbying. Finally, I explore the extent to which assumptions about enforcement capacity and willingness influ- ence lawmaking and in turn shape enforcement capacity and provide support for the existence of this reciprocal relation- ship. State Capacity and the Effects of Law on Legal Policymakers Organizational probation was facilitated most fundamen- tally by the structurally rooted capacities of the Sentencing Commission. In its effort to insulate the Sentencing Commis- sion from political pressures, primarily to assist development of individual sentencing guidelines, Congress established a unique statutory framework for the Commission. This struc- ture, particularly as interpreted by the Commission, limited the potential effectiveness of business lobbying by strengthening state autonomy and capacity. It did so by compelling the issu- ance of binding organizational guidelines and by establishing impediments to congressional and White House modification of these guidelines. That this structure could contribute to the development of separate and binding organizational sentenc- ing guidelines was little recognized until after the Sentencing Commission began its work, demonstrating the independent role of state structures and state actors in lawmaking (Skocpol 1985). The role of state capacity in the development of organi- zational probation was twofold. I first explain the origins of state capacity and then examine the reasons the Sentencing Commission exercised this capacity. Establishing State Capacity The statutory authority to develop organizational probation was shaped by many smaller decisions made by state workers in the Brown Commission and Congress, as well as by the Sen- tencing Commission. Each decision was so small and discrete that it did not receive much notice or provoke much concern at the time it was made. These steps contributed to the ultimate development of probation by gradually institutionalizing its foundations, strengthening state capacity, and in the process undermining the grounds for opposition to its continued devel- opment. In this way, law exerts independent effects on the range of perceived action and on the actions of all parties in-</page><page sequence="17">Lofquist 757 volved in lawmaking (Turkel &amp; Lofquist 1991). These smaller steps were not part of any plan. In fact, with few exceptions, the shape ultimately taken by organizational probation was not foreseen by its early supporters or opponents.27 Among these steps was the early decision to employ the term "probation." This created an image of leniency and famil- iarity. It also contributed to long-lasting confusion regarding the application of this sanction to organizations.28 The decision to make probation for both individual and organizational of- fenders a distinct and independent sanction, thereby eliminat- ing the defendant's right of refusal and the legal status of pro- bation as a "grace," was also important. Although taken to strengthen individual probation, and without regard to organi- zations, this action removed the primary obstacle to the use of organizational probation under the Federal Probation Act. Under the SRA there can be no doubt that organizations can be placed on probation, even against their wishes, and that the conditions of probation can exceed the severity of the available fine. The most important steps in minimizing attention and op- position to organizational probation were the early failures of the Brown Commission and Congress to develop conditions for distinct organizational probation, while mandating use of organizational probation. This deflected scrutiny from organi- zational probation by denying to it an organization-specific identity. Organizational probation was thus presented to the Sentencing Commission without much congressional consider- ation, though with a latent capacity for subsequent develop- ment. Commissioner Gelacak, identified as less supportive of organizational probation than other Sentencing Commission members,29 expressed this view of the SRA. Speaking to a busi- ness audience on the eve of the implementation of the guide- lines, Gelacak criticized business for failing to do more to op- pose organizational sanctions in Congress. He argued that once the SRA was passed, the Sentencing Commission was ob- ligated to develop organizational sentences; "we can't ignore it. It's there by Congressional directive" (Gelacak 1991). While this statement historicizes the work of the Sentencing Commis- sion, ignoring the broad range of alternatives it had available, it points out the incremental development of organizational pro- 27 It is likely that had the development of organizational probation been more widely anticipated, steps would have been taken to limit its development. 28 Many commentators have cited the lenient legacy of probation in expressing their opposition to, and confusion about, the direction of its development in the orga- nizational sentencing guidelines (Business Roundtable 1990b; National Association of Manufacturers 1988). 29 Interviews with John C. Coffee, Jr., Adolf A. Berle Professor of Law, Columbia University Law School, 10 June 1991; Richard Rogers, Office of Legal Counsel, Ford Motor Co. Counsel, National Association of Manufacturers, 31 July 1991.</page><page sequence="18">758 Legislating Organizational Probation bation and the role of law in enhancing state capacity at the same time that it blunts opposition to further legal develop- ment. The Sentencing Commission, in turn, had the capacity and autonomy to develop this sanction. In his comprehensive analy- sis of the Sentencing Commission from the perspective of ad- ministrative law, Wright (1991) noted that several features of the SRA establish the Sentencing Commission as "exception- ally" insulated from political pressure. Among these are the Commission's establishment as permanent and nonpartisan and its placement outside the executive branch. As a judicial branch agency, the Commission's output is not subject to the type of review experienced by executive branch regulatory agencies. As a result, pro-business pressures within the White House, exemplified most dramatically by the recently contro- versial Council on Competitiveness (Shute 1991; Hilts 1991) and the earlier Task Force on Regulatory Relief (Greider 1992) are not brought to bear on sentencing guidelines and amend- ments. Also important is the requirement that the Sentencing Commission's statutory output receive full and formal congres- sional consideration prior to modification. Changing the guide- lines requires passage of legislation in both the House and the Senate and the signature of the president, all of which must be accomplished in six months (much of which may be taken up by recess and reelection campaigns). As the failures of opponents of organizational sentencing guidelines make clear, these struc- tural features of the Sentencing Commission proved critical when it took steps to develop organizational probation, as well as when business groups sought eleventh-hour White House and congressional relief from enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines. Employing State Capacity These legal and organizational frameworks provide a back- ground for understanding Sentencing Commission actions in developing organizational probation. However, they do not ex- plain these actions. The Commission had a great deal of discre- tion within its statutory mandate and a structurally protected position from which to carry out this mandate (Wright 1991). It could have chosen a narrow statutory interpretation, leading to continued reliance on individual probation conditions or, at best, organization-specific policy statements. This latter ap- proach was widely favored throughout the Commission's delib- erations.30 Whether and how the Commission utilized its law- 30 Business groups and other opponents of organizational probation argued for policy statements if organizational probation was to be enacted. Even early advocates of organizational probation, including the interventionist CGS proposal, favored policy statements. As the debate continued, and the Sentencing Commission evidenced sup-</page><page sequence="19">Lofquist 759 making autonomy and capacity is a test of the relationship between state lawmakers and business and of the circumstances under which the state can act to limit business power. Through a series of statutory interpretations and entrepreneurial ac- tions, the Commission demonstrated some independence from political economic considerations. It rejected internal and ex- ternal demands to shelve organizational guidelines. Then, after acceding to business pressure to reduce proposed fines and ex- periencing the subsequent criticism, it enacted intrusive and re- medial probation provisions over the opposition of business. A key step in interpreting the Sentencing Commission's mandate, taken casually and without congressional require- ment, was to separate guidelines for individuals and organiza- tions. The Commission could have retained generic, tradition- ally individualistic, probation conditions for use with individual and organizational offenders.31 Such an outcome would have certainly impeded use of organizational probation, as its use under the FPA illustrates. Separating consideration of different types of offenders led the Commission to specifically and inde- pendently consider the circumstances under which organiza- tions should be placed on probation and the conditions that should accompany such a sentence. In addition, Commissioner MacKinnon successfully argued that the Commission was man- dated to give equal treatment to individuals and organizations by developing binding sentences for organizations. The SRA was ambiguous on this point (see Lofquist 1992; U.S. Senate 1983) and very possibly could be interpreted to require only policy statements for organizational probation. In addition to Commissioner MacKinnon's entrepreneurial- ism, Commissioner Nagel's individual efforts were critical to the development of organizational probation.32 By encourag- ing Professor Coffee to develop what became the CGS propo- sal, and by soliciting the participation of several regulatory and public interest witnesses,33 she assured that organizational pro- bation remained on the reform agenda at times when the Com- mission was dominated by Commissioner Block's en- trepreneurial efforts in the other direction. Because of their close proximity to lawmaking and their resulting ability to ma- nipulate the lawmaking process, these "legal entrepreneurs" were able to influence the reform agenda even in the absence port for binding guidelines, supporters of organizational probation adopted this more forceful position. 31 This is the course that Congress had taken in its efforts. The congressional debate provides no reason to believe that Congress favored or any party anticipated the development of separate organizational probation provisions. 32 Interviews with Coffee (see note 29), Heider (see note 23), and Rogers (see note 29). 33 Interviews with Coffee (see note 29), and Ilene H. Nagel, Commissioner, U.S. Sentencing Commission, 6 Aug. 1991.</page><page sequence="20">760 Legislating Organizational Probation of public or other pressure for change. This provides a marked contrast to the moral entrepreneurialism of societal actors (Gusfield 1963; Platt 1969), who depended on public support to bring about legal changes. A final consideration relating to the roles of the Sentencing Commission's structure and operations in the development of organizational probation is that the probation provisions were found at the end of each draft. Commissioner Nagel explained the possible significance of this in relation to the dynamics of meetings of the Commissioners: [I]n part, [probation] benefited from the fact that it was at the end, paginally. It came after the fine section. So if you under- stand the nature of the discussion, we would start with para- graph one, page one, introduction. We must have debated that 200 times. We almost never got to the end. So there was probation, sitting there.34 Although organizational probation certainly was scrutinized by each commissioner, as is evidenced by changes in each propo- sal, it is likely that its ultimate status benefited to some extent from the lesser amount of collective consideration it received relative to other organizational sentencing issues. Regulatory Support for Organizational Probation Law and policy outcomes contrary to the interests of capi- talists often derive from public and labor pressures on policy- makers too great to ignore (Hopkins 1979; Snider 1987; Cullen et al. 1987; Chambliss 1986; Block 1987). The sources of pres- sures for law creation were somewhat different in this case. Both before and after organizational sentencing emerged as the focus of the Sentencing Commission's attention, support for sentencing reform was led by state workers in Congress, regulatory agencies, and the DOJ. Initially, the driving force was rationalization of the criminal code; frustration with mar- ket-based sanctions, legitimacy concerns, and bureaucratic en- trepreneurialism emerged later. This suggests that there may be limitations to society-centered analyses, particularly plural- ism (Dahl 1956; Friedman 1977), instrumentalism (Miliband 1969; Domhoff 1983), corporate liberalism (Kolko 1963; Wein- stein 1968; Sklar 1988), and class struggle theory (Korpi 1983; Esping-Andersen 1985), which place societal actors, particu- larly business, labor, and public interest groups, at the center of law reform movements. Business groups opposed organizational sentencing stan- dards throughout their long development. Although business was successful in winning modification of the final guidelines, it was consistently opposed to any type of guidelines. Despite the 34 Interview with Nagel (see note 33).</page><page sequence="21">Lofquist 761 Sentencing Commission's project of rationalizing and enhanc- ing the sanctions through which offense statutes are enforced, labor, environmental, consumer, and other public interest groups were largely absent from and not influential in the orga- nizational sentencing reform debate. Labor's only involvement was to protect its own immediate interests, by arguing against the extension of organizational sentencing guidelines to noncorporate organizations, such as unions (American Federa- tion of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations 1990). Public interest groups testified only once before the Sentencing Commission (U.S. Sentencing Commission 1990a). Environ- mental groups were similarly inactive, submitting comments once in 1990 and once in 1991, and only after pressure from Commissioner Nagel.35 A commentator closely linked to the public interest community attributed their inactivity to re- source limitations and to their greater concern with enforce- ment activities.36 This is consistent with the larger absence of public interest groups from regulatory debates throughout the 1980s (Greider 1992:50). Given such constraints, lawmaking was perceived as too far removed from law enforcement to compel greater attention. Active involvement in lawmaking came primarily from the more immediate constituents of corporate criminal law: those state workers who enforce it and those against whom it is en- forced, as well as academic legal experts (see Coffee 1988; First 1988; Stone 1988). State managers, particularly at the highest reaches of the Department of Justice, were less supportive of nonmarket sanctions. The DOJ favored an expansion of its prosecutorial powers and supported new and strengthened sanctions toward this end (U.S. Department ofJustice 1989). In practice, this led to strongest support for increased fines. Orga- nizational probation received less enthusiastic support, proba- bly as a result of its weakness in past practice37 and the recogni- tion that the monitoring resources associated with it will flow to regulatory agencies and probation departments, not to the DOJ. The ability of the White House and business groups to influence DOJ actions (see Environmental Crimes Project 1992; Wald 1992; see also Schneider 1992) also suggests defer- ence to political economic concerns on their part. Regulatory enforcement personnel viewed organizational probation as an innovative corporate crime control, as well as a means to expand their oversight responsibilities and the re- 35 Interviews with Coffee (see note 29) and Nagel (see note 33). 36 This remark was made off the record in an interview with the author. 37 The DOJ often appealed uses of organizational probation under the FPA on the grounds that this sanction further weakened already weak fines. The DOJ was par- ticularly opposed to community service conditions imposed in exchange for reduced fines. See Levin 1984; Lofquist 1992.</page><page sequence="22">762 Legislating Organizational Probation sources supporting these responsibilities.38 Recent deregula- tion had diminished these resources (Greider 1992; Vogel 1988). In support of these goals, regulatory agencies regularly offered detailed probation proposals to the Sentencing Com- mission. The EPA, in particular, actively supported use of orga- nizational probation under the FPA (U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency 1988; Adler &amp; Lord 1991) and lobbied aggres- sively to gain the strongest possible probation provisions in the organizational sentencing guidelines. At the end of this effort, an EPA official, in an internal memorandum, stated: "If the Agency actively fulfills the responsibilities that the Commission envisions regulatory agencies serving not only in the sentenc- ing process, but also in making probation a meaningful 'reha- bilitative' sanction, the Guidelines could be a real turbocharger for the criminal enforcement program" (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1991). Little attention was given to fines, a strategic decision reflecting the perceived inefficacy of this sanction for crime control and agency building. Acting more in the interests of expanding their own power and increasing agency effectiveness than in the interests of a larger rationalizing agenda (Block 1987), as has been sug- gested by structuralists (Poulantzas 1973; O'Connor 1973), regulatory agencies also lobbied aggressively for a direct and substantial role in approving and monitoring organizational compliance plans. The overarching links between the state and capital that structuralists describe as impeding legal control of corporations were not apparent in the development of organi- zational probation, though it is unlikely that the perceived threat of organizational probation, particularly given the uncer- tainty of enforcement, was great enough to threaten the rela- tionship between business and the state. Should active enforce- ment efforts occur, the independence of enforcement personnel will surely be tested (see Environmental Crimes Pro- ject 1992). Legitimacy, Equity, and an Implicit Quid Pro Quo Regulatory pressures for the development of organizational probation were supplemented and enhanced by the Sentencing Commission's concern that its organizational legitimacy was in danger of being compromised. I will not detail the many polit- ical, personnel, and administrative controversies in which the Commission was embroiled at various times (see U.S. House of Representatives 1990; Yost 1989a, 1989b, 1989c); these con- troversies, however, clearly gave the Commission reason to be concerned about its standing throughout government and 38 Interview with Bellin (see note 24); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1988, 1991; U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration 1988.</page><page sequence="23">Lofquist 763 among relevant interest groups. Another important legitimacy consideration was that the individual guidelines it promulgated were substantially more punitive than previous individual sentences (Tonry 1991), a situation that raised the specter of bias if the organizational guidelines were not similarly punitive. As Commissioner Nagel remarked, "you can't justify imprison- ment of indigents who stole small sums of money and lightly slap corporations that steal large sums" (quoted in Strasser 1989:3). In much the same way that public pressures constrain the ability of state actors to respond to the demands of business, or to capital accumulation more generally, organizational legiti- macy considerations impact state capacity by limiting the recep- tiveness of an organization to pressures to deviate from its mandate. Legitimacy problems compel stricter adherence to statutory law, which in this case was the source of state capac- ity. Imperiled by constitutional,39 organizational, and political questions, the Commission was particularly sensitive to criti- cism during the development of organizational sentencing guidelines. When, after vigorous lobbying from business, the Commission gave considerable ground on the organizational fining provisions, its legitimacy was further eroded. This con- cession provoked strong opposition from the Department of Justice (U.S. Department ofJustice 1990) and made the dispar- ity in treatment of individual and organizational offenders even more pronounced. Given the magnitude and origins of these legitimacy concerns, the Commission felt a need to justify it- self, to protect itself against its critics, and to demonstrate its productivity (Hawkins &amp; Thomas 1989; Hawkins 1984; Sabatier 1977). It did so by exercising its state capacity to develop orga- nizational probation. In issuing its final organizational sentenc- ing guidelines, the Sentencing Commission resisted business and White House pressure and made broad use of its lawmak- ing powers. When asked why the Commission had taken an "activist" approach to organizational probation, former Commission staff memberJeffrey Parker, who had resigned because of the Com- mission's activism, cited several factors. Among them was a concern about its tenuous legal standing. Parker also identified a second legitimacy issue. Speaking of the development of or- ganizational probation, he remarked that "in a way it helped to deflect attention from other areas where, perhaps arguably, they were doing less than they were supposed to."40 Whether this took the form of a quid pro quo, in which leniency on orga- 39 The constitutionality of the Sentencing Commission was challenged after its individual sentencing guidelines were promulgated. In 1989, the Supreme Court found in favor of the Sentencing Commission (Mistretta v. United States). 40 Interview with Parker (see note 25).</page><page sequence="24">764 Legislating Organizational Probation nizational fines was traded for rigor on probation, is unclear. Such a deal was never openly discussed. However, the strength of the final organizational probation provisions helped to main- tain some level of equity in treatment of individuals and organi- zations and to mollify those Commissioners who sought tougher organizational sanctions. It may be that, having bowed to business pressure on the fining provisions, the Sentencing Commission, or at least its most pro-sanctioning faction, was not directly confronted on organizational probation as part of an unspoken quid pro quo. Some participants in the development of the guidelines en- tertained the prospect that this had occurred.41 Most notably, when asked whether business lobbying against probation could have been effective, as it was with fines, Commissioner Nagel replied, Sure. I would have every reason to think so. Let me say some- thing else, and I don't have any evidence of this. This is sort of a hypothesis. There was a perception on the part of some that there were some members of the Commission, myself in- cluded, who were very unhappy about the direction [of the guidelines]. We started out very tough. We got less tough, less tough, less tough. It may well have been that probation was a bone tossed to us. That is, it was a way of placating those of us who thought the fine structure was already in- defensible. They knew it was important to us, that [eliminat- ing organizational probation] probably would have been the last straw .... So, there may well have been a thought among some, "let's not destroy probation because we've gotten so much on lowering fines."42 Linking this to the Commission's legitimacy concerns, Nagel stated, "there's a certain institutional loss from dissents that are critical [especially since] the Commission has been em- broiled in controversy from the beginning." Although he did not mention the possibility of a quid pro quo, Richard Gruner also identified "the extreme controversy over how the fine standards were set up" as a factor in the Commission's support for organizational probation.43 In his view, the Commission sought to avoid another controversy by agreeing on probation provisions generally accepted as "rea- sonable" and leaving it up to the courts to work out the details of their implementation. This view gains plausibility when it is recognized that the timing of the Commission's renewed sup- port for organizational probation, after it was nearly written out of existence in the spring of 1990, followed its formal adop- 41 Interviews with Vicky Portney, Criminal Division, U.S. Department ofJustice, 9 Oct. 1991; Brent T.

Overall, then, legitimacy concerns increased the Sentencing Commission's receptiveness to organizational probation at the same time that regulatory agencies were providing detailed probation proposals. This suggests that legitimacy considera- tions sometimes play an important role in strengthening lawmakers' resolve to employ their lawmaking capacity. It also supports the position (Skocpol 1985) that state capacity is vari- able and negotiated, depending on the power of business, the availability of statutory support, and numerous case-specific circumstances. Business Strategy and Bounded Rationality Finally, business responses to state efforts to legislate orga- nizational sentencing guidelines contributed to the develop- ment of organizational probation. When asked about the rela- tive inattention of business to organizational probation, people closely involved in the development of the sentencing guide- lines44 expressed puzzlement. The novelty of this sanction and the threats to organizational autonomy it presented could be expected to provoke considerable concern among business groups. This view is consistent with the widespread perception (Galbraith 1985; Silk &amp; Vogel 1976; Vogel 1978) that organiza- tions view protection of their autonomy as a paramount con- cern. However, while business regularly stated its opposition to probation, sometimes with great concern, it did not mount sus- tained or successful opposition. Threats to managerial prerog- atives and American competitiveness, and charges that organi- zational probation was unnecessary and unauthorized were secondary to a larger attack on the effort to establish sentenc- ing guidelines. The extent to which business is able to effectively under- stand and represent its interests in the political arena is a sub- ject of considerable dispute. Instrumentalists, particularly cor- porate liberalists, have long argued that business groups recognize their long-term interests and advance them in a uni- fied and coherent fashion (Miliband 1969; Quinney 1974; Domhoff 1983, 1990). Critics of this position (Skocpol 1980; Balbus 1982; Block 1977, 1987; Vogel 1988) argue that unity and foresight cannot be so easily assigned to business in gen- eral or even to sectors of the business community. Free market ideology limits collective consciousness, which itself does not necessarily or easily translate into programmatic efforts. As a 44 Interviews with Mark A. Cohen, Professor of Management, Vanderbilt Univer- sity, former Consultant, United States Sentencing Commission, 19 Sept. 1991; Bellin (see note 24); Portney (see note 41); Lott 1991; letter from Levine to Lofquist (see note 24); interview with Gruner (see note 24).</page><page sequence="26">766 Legislating Organizational Probation result, business groups sometimes oppose measures consistent with their long-term interests and fail to oppose threatening legislation. Organizational complexity and cognitive limitations bound the rationality of decisionmakers (March &amp; Simon 1963; Simon 1979). In addition to contributing to the incidence of corporate crime, this bounded rationality may "create the dis- order that brings about change and unanticipated new orders" (Perrow 1986:123). Business groups, even if unified to form an "inner circle" (Useem 1984), may ineffectively advance their in- terests due to strategic miscalculations regarding the lawmak- ing environment (McCaffrey 1982) or misunderstanding of the issues under consideration. Organization does not assure un- derstanding. In the present case, three different points are identified as strategic decisions on the part of business that contributed to the development of organizational probation. Attention to Threshold Issues Business groups, whose lobbying efforts were dominated by large corporations and trade associations, and were supported by various executive branch agencies, believed they could de- rail development of corporate sanctions. This view was based on their interpretations of the legal and political environments, which they viewed as supportive of business interests and not strongly supportive of organizational sentencing guidelines or corporate criminal law enforcement more generally. Such an outcome would make moot the particular provisions of the guidelines. Business pursued this strategy, to the exclusion of a more provision-oriented strategy, by promoting narrow inter- pretations of the Sentencing Commission's enabling legislation and by stressing the unfairness and anticompetitive conse- quences of sentencing standards. The absence of a congres- sional or practical mandate for binding guidelines and the ad- vantages of policy statements were constant themes in business lobbying efforts.45 Just in the final two weeks before the guide- lines were submitted to Congress, business twice invoked this argument in soliciting outside intervention to derail the guide- lines (Business Roundtable et al. 1991; Strasser 1991). Busi- ness also lobbied vigorously for reliance on policy statements, which are not binding on judges. They thought that unless compelled, judges would be reluctant to place organizations on probation.46 As described by Commissioner Nagel, business was "right to recognize that the critical issue was policy statements versus 45 Business Roundtable 1988; National Association of Manufacturers 1990; inter- views with Rogers (see note 29) and Heider (see note 23). 46 Interviews with Heider (see note 23) and Rogers (see note 29).</page><page sequence="27">Lofquist 767 guidelines." However, she went on to note that business groups probably played their hand wrong on that, because once they saw they didn't have the votes they should have moved on, and they spent too much time on that. If I were advising them I would have said, "You should have counted votes early on. You didn't have it. If there are going to be guidelines, make sure they're more consistent with what you want."47 Some business witnesses agreed in retrospect that the specific guidelines provisions, particularly probation, should have re- ceived more of their attention.48 Because business failed to focus on the probation provi- sions, the strength and unity of regulatory and academic sup- port for remedial organizational probation went unchallenged at the programmatic level. Business did not advance alternative probation proposals that satisfied the minimum standards pro- vided by Congress. Although extensive attention to the thresh- old issues made a complete "victory" by business possible, it also diverted business from debating the nuts and bolts of the guidelines. As a result, when legitimacy considerations and statutory interpretations led the Sentencing Commission to fully utilize its capacity to make binding sentencing law for or- ganizations, business groups had already missed the opportu- nity to challenge regulatory agencies over the content of these guidelines. Such an oppositional and ultimately nonconstruc- tive approach to regulation by business has been identified elsewhere (Reich 1981) as contributing to the development of regulation. Interpreting and Enforcing the Guidelines Second, probably as a result of large corporations' domi- nance of business lobbying efforts and the weakness of past corporate crime control efforts, business representatives be- lieved that organizational probation would have little impact in practice, particularly on the type of organizations they repre- sented. Frederick Stocker, Counsel for the Manufacturers' Alli- ance for Productivity and Innovation (MAPI), for example, stated that organizational probation was not given more atten- tion by the business community because criminal prosecutions were rare and because organizational probation was "war- ranted in so few circumstances. ... If it were a more common possibility it would be a greater concern."49 This explanation is 47 Interview with Nagel (see note 33). 48 Interviews with Heider (see note 23); Rogers (see note 29); and Frederick Stocker, Counsel, Manufacturers' Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, 5 June 1991. 49 Interview with Stocker (see note 48).</page><page sequence="28">768 Legislating Organizational Probation consistent with business lobbying, which focused foremost on threshold issues, with lesser attention to fines and still less to probation. Stocker stated that probation was in and of itself of greater concern to business than were fines, due to the intervention and oversight it authorized and the inability of the courts to manage such interventions. Although perhaps well-inten- tioned, probation, he argued, "may well kill businesses" in the effort to change them.50 The NAM invoked this same imagery when it declared that probation was a "potential death sen- tence" (National Association of Manufacturers 1990) because of the inefficiency and clumsiness of judicial oversight. At the same time, however, criminal convictions were viewed primar- ily as a matter of concern for smaller corporations. Further, or- ganizational probation was viewed as applying only to the most serious offenses. Small corporations are disproportionately prosecuted and convicted of criminal offenses (Cohen et al. 1988; Cohen 1991), though legal changes over the past decade and recent data raise the possibility that this situation is changing.51 As David Lombardero, former Chief Counsel to the Commission, noted, business probably failed to appreciate the increased im- portance that criminal sanctions would have for them. Previ- ously, businesses were prosecuted infrequently and the penal- ties imposed were small (Lombardero 1991:9). Despite legal changes, criminal enforcement has not yet become a major is- sue for corporations, particularly large corporations. Lombar- dero made an additional point, that concern about self-incrimi- nation implicit in opposing criminal sanctions may have limited business opposition, particularly because such a sanction is more likely to be used in cases of serious wrongdoing. Stocker's larger point, that organizational probation is rarely authorized, is arguable. Although definitive conclusions await enforcement, organizational probation is mandatory in many cases (Orland 1991a; Wray 1992; Zagrocki 1992). In fact, it can be contended that given the broad wording of some of the uses of probation, this sanction is universally available. This suggests that statements like Stocker's reflect, at least in part, a failure to closely scrutinize the final guidelines, which differ from earlier proposals. The most numerous and far-reaching mandatory uses of probation were introduced only at the end of the Sentencing Commission's efforts.52 An additional con- 50 Ibid. 51 In addition to expanded corporate criminal liability and strengthened sanc- tions, there is evidence that criminal prosecutions of larger corporations are increasing and that these prosecutions comprise a larger percentage of total prosecutions than in the past (Obermaier 1991; Cohen 1989, 1991c). 52 Letter from Levine to Lofquist (see note 24).</page><page sequence="29">Lofquist 769 sideration is that dismissive statements by business may repre- sent ex post facto efforts to provide favorable accounts of legal outcomes that they underestimated or misunderstood (see Flood 1991). Commissioner Nagel, for example, stated that "the business people to this day have largely no idea about how the guidelines work or what they ever said."53 This view is further supported by written comments to the Commission by business misinterpreting organizational proba- tion (Business Roundtable 1990a; National Association of Man- ufacturers 1991). As late as 1991, the NAM argued that the Commission fundamentally misunderstood the uses of proba- tion, premising its argument on a 50-year-old Supreme Court case that had been superseded by case law since 1972 and by the SRA in 1984. Additional evidence of business's misunder- standing of and nonresponsiveness to the criminal law is pro- vided by recent reports indicating that since becoming law, many businesses have not responded to the guidelines or are even fully aware of their implications (Hayes 1991). Even some large corporations, which retain legal counsel in Washington, have not taken the kinds of preventive steps that would clearly reduce potential monetary and nonmonetary sanctions in the event of a criminal conviction. Attorneys, compliance officials, and legal commentators are increasingly advising corporations to take these steps (Lavelle 1992; Kaplan &amp; Perry 1991; ABA Banking Journal 1992; Chaset &amp; Weintraub 1992; Best et al. 1992; Wallance 1991). Confidence in the Courts The most important reason for the view that organizational probation will not be widely used is the belief in a favorable enforcement environment, particularly for large corporations. Jon Heider of B. F. Goodrich and the Business Roundtable (BRT) said that organizational probation would not be applied to corporations like his or those in the BRT. Rather, probation will be imposed only on "flagrant acts and chronic offend- ers."54 Richard Rogers of Ford and the NAM echoed the same themes: You really have to rely on the common sense ofjudges. Com- panies with long records of obeying the law and long records of having legal compliance programs, and I think we're one of those, are probably less at risk than someone who truly is an unprincipled son of a bitch running a business. I just can't see that happening to a major company, unless they had it 53 Interview with Nagel (see note 33). 54 Interview with Heider (see note 23).</page><page sequence="30">770 Legislating Organizational Probation coming, someone who had made conscious decisions to dis- regard some fairly serious law.55 Jeffrey Parker also suggested that the limits of law to which business was accustomed (see Yeager 1991) would emerge in the courts, when efforts were made to place corporations, par- ticularly large corporations, on probation. Parker claimed that business "just didn't believe, and they probably still don't be- lieve, that it's really going to happen." He continued by noting, "you can have guidelines and you can have the authority to do something. That doesn't mean you're going to do it."56 The discretion built into interpretation of the uses and con- ditions of probation provides an opportunity for business de- fendants to pressure the courts for less frequent use of this sanction and less intrusive conditions. The battleground is thus shifted from the Sentencing Commission to the courts, though it is important to note that the guidelines themselves shape to some extent the course of this conflict. Some argue that courts and prosecutors, recognizing the increased strength of avail- able sanctions, will respond through increased use of criminal prosecutions and organizational probation.57 As the preceding comments of Heider and Rogers indicate, however, business is confident that it will have more success in advancing its views in the courtroom than it had with the Sentencing Commission. Jeffrey Parker agreed; "there is a lot of thinking that criminal sentencing, especially in the corporate sphere, is just political theater. It's not reality at all; it's just designed to satisfy peo- ple."58 Richard Rogers took a sterner tone.59 Although he re- garded an effort to place Ford on probation as unlikely, were it to happen, Rogers stated that Ford "may very well decide to go to war and hire Jim Neal," the attorney Ford hired when it was prosecuted for homicide in the Pinto case. It is again evident that assumptions about enforcement ca- pacity permeate lawmaking. On the one hand, supporters of enhanced sanctions clearly recognized that statutory strength was fundamental to improving enforcement efforts.60 This led the Commission, just as it had earlier led Congress, "to give the court as many options as possible to fashion an appropriate remedy."61 The Commission also sought to more tightly couple convictions and sentences through mandatory sentenc- ing guidelines. Concern about enforcement also led regulatory 55 Interview with Rogers (see note 29). 56 Interview with Parker (see note 25). 57 Corporate Crime Reporter 1988; interview with Gruner (see note 24). 58 Interview with Parker (see note 25). 59 Interview with Rogers (see note 29). 60 Interviews with Gainer (see note 9), Bellin (see note 24), Blakey (see note 7), and Schwartz (see note 7). 61 Interview with Nagel (see note 33).</page><page sequence="31">Lofquist 771 agencies to support broad statutory powers over organizational defendants. The provision of mandatory probation conditions and detailed compliance plans were particularly important in this regard. On the other hand, business assumed that specific statutory provisions were unimportant in part because of the predictability and stability of the enforcement environment. Conclusion: Theoretical and Practical Implications This study, while faced with the problems of relating gen- eral theories to particular cases that characterize case studies (Rogers 1991; Kiser &amp; Hechter 1991), raises implications for theories of law creation. The first point concerns the great di- versity of state actors involved in lawmaking. This diversity will only increase as state capacity increases. As a result, sociolegal studies must recognize not only the importance of the state as an actor but also the paradox pointed out by Schmitter (1985): The diversity of state actors makes consideration of the in- dependent role of the state problematic just at the time that the state is receiving increased scholarly attention. My study indi- cates not only that state actors may pursue interests independ- ent of the demands and interests of societal groups (Skocpol 1985) but also that state actors may pursue interests independ- ent of one another. Middle-level state actors, identified here as state workers, led efforts to expand state power over business. Higher-level state managers demonstrated close ties to busi- ness interests, expressing little interest in corporate crime con- trol. There is thus a need for increased attention to specifying the complexity of state actors and for understanding how these actors interrelate with societal actors in lawmaking and en- forcement. It is also important to point out that the ability of state ac- tors to pursue their interests is closely circumscribed (Block 1987). Regulatory agencies and members of the Sentencing Commission sought expanded legal controls on business but were only able to gain these controls when legitimacy concerns, business strategy, and concessions on fines weakened potential opposition to the development of organizational probation. Even with substantial state capacity (Wright 1991), the Com- mission faced strong opposition from business, legal groups, and the White House in its efforts to enact broadly strength- ened sanctions. Lesser state capacity, particularly through ex- panded external review of the Commission's statutory output, likely would have undermined organizational probation. The tenuousness of the organizational sentencing guidelines sug- gests the strength of free market ideology and the value of the type of societal support for law creation, particularly from labor and public interest groups, identified as lacking in this case.</page><page sequence="32">772 Legislating Organizational Probation The second point concerns the bounded rationality of orga- nizational actors. It is a central tenet of the organizational ap- proach to corporate crime that organizations are characterized by, among other things, structural complexity, diversity of in- terests and motives, and information shortages (March &amp; Si- mon 1963). These factors contribute to corporate crime by lim- iting the ability or willingness of employees to recognize, control, or assume responsibility for emerging organizational wrongdoing (Ermann 1990; Ermann &amp; Lundman 1992). These same limitations on organizational rationality can be applied to those organizations involved in the development of organiza- tional probation. This presents problems for theories of law creation that assume rationality. State and business witnesses were the most prominent participants in the case reported here; neither of these groups was fully informed, unified, or organized in its efforts. In large measure, both acted in re- sponse to narrow, short-term, and partially informed under- standings of the development of organizational sentencing standards. Business witnesses lacked understanding of the mechanics of organizational probation and the legal foundations for its implementation, even in the final stages of its development. Distracted by its attention to threshold issues, business contin- ued viewing probation as it had been under the FPA. As a re- sult, though big business dominated business lobbying and did not represent the separate interests of small business, corpo- rate liberalist (Kolko 1963; Weinstein 1968; Sklar 1988) expla- nations do not pertain. There is no evidence that big business recognized or sought competitive advantage in the develop- ment of organizational probation. Interviews with business lob- byists and their opponents produced no suggestion of corpo- rate liberalism. Their opposition to organizational probation, though not fully informed, was clearly and often stated. Although competitive advantages exist, particularly as a result of the increased likelihood that large corporations already have compliance plans in place and the lesser likelihood that they will be criminally prosecuted (Cohen 1992; Chaset &amp; Wein- traub 1992), these advantages did not influence business strat- egy. Big business may have been insensitive to the concerns of smaller corporations; it did not, however, explicitly exhibit the collective rationality to exploit these concerns to its advantage. State witnesses also lacked internal, collective organization or even a rudimentary plan for the development of corporate crime controls. Rather, various state groups and even individu- als within these groups had different views of appropriate cor- porate criminal sanctions. Contrary to the view of implicit unity between state actions and the interests of capitalists (Pou- lantzas 1973), evidence suggests that state-based advocates of</page><page sequence="33">Lofquist 773 probation were pursuing their own interests. The lobbying ef- forts of regulatory agencies, the Department ofJustice, and ad- visory organizations, and the responses of the Sentencing Commission reflected pursuit and protection of resources and legitimacy. There was little or no coordination among these groups and little or no consideration of long-term macro- economic issues. Also, except for isolated individuals, neither the Brown Commission, Congress, nor the Sentencing Com- mission had a vision for the development of organizational pro- bation. Its ultimate shape was a product of its incremental de- velopment and the contributions of a host of different actors. The third point concerns the relationship between statutory law and enforcement. This relationship has been substantially discredited among academicians, particularly where corpora- tions are concerned (Shover et al. 1986; Yeager 1991; Coleman 1985a, 1985b). There is a growing sense that statutory law is unimportant and that enforcement exists independent of statu- tory provisions. The gap between statutory law and its enforce- ment has been found to be particularly wide in the corporate sphere, producing routinely disappointing, though not entirely unsuccessful, corporate crime control efforts. Structural con- siderations, particularly politicoeconomic, have intervened to limit enforcement efforts, creating the impression that whether in the legislature or in the courts, business power is ultimately unassailable. Rather than ignoring or rejecting statutory law, however, this research suggests the interpenetration of statutory law and enforcement. The debate over organizational probation was to a great extent a debate over statutory construction rather than specific statutory provisions. Anticipating future opposition to law creation and law enforcement, advocates of organizational probation at every turn sought clear statutory language to facil- itate its further development and use. They also supported ef- forts to more tightly couple prosecution and sentencing through binding organizational probation provisions. Past use of individual-based sanctions provided too much discretion and ambiguity, and too little statutory support, for effective ap- plication to organizations. There was thus a recognition that the potential effective- ness of enforcement is conditioned in part on the form and content of statutory law. Opponents, particularly business op- ponents, sought ambiguity and judicial discretion, first to deny statutory authority to the Sentencing Commission and later to weaken this authority. At the same time, relying in large part on their knowledge of enforcement practices, business groups di- verted attention from organizational probation, despite its threats to their autonomy. Anticipated resource constraints on enforcement and judicial unwillingness to employ probation</page><page sequence="34">774 Legislating Organizational Probation were placed ahead of statutory considerations. The belief that law would not be enforced reduced concern about the content of law. Under such circumstances, increased scholarly attention to statutory law and the way it can and does shape enforce- ment, as well as the extent to which assumptions about enforce- ment shape lawmaking, helps to inform our understanding of the gap between statutory law and enforcement. It also pro- vides an important foundation for assessing implementation. The research reported here contributes toward these ends. The final issue for consideration, then, is to begin to assess whether corporations appropriately gauged the threat they face in organizational probation. Ultimate resolution of this ques- tion awaits implementation of the sanction by the federal courts. However, there are several reasons to reject reflexive negativism. Among them are the extent to which the use of probation is mandatory in the guidelines and the potential, in light of recent dramatic cases, that public pressure for en- hanced prosecutions will increase (see Katz 1980). In addition, empirical evidence suggests that prosecutorial decisionmaking regarding civil and criminal prosecutions and sanctioning is af- fected by the strength and type of available sanctions (Frank 1983; Benson et al. 1988, 1990) and the amount of public at- tention a case may generate. The cost and complexity of corpo- rate criminal prosecutions discourages their use, except where the investment may lead to a meaningful sanction and en- hanced career opportunities. Prosecutors may alter this deci- sional calculus in favor of criminal prosecutions in light of the increased strength of available sanctions. John Coffee made this point in noting that the organizational sentencing guide- lines "have the potential to make the prosecutor's investment of time and effort in [prosecuting organizations] much more meaningful" (Corporate Crime Reporter 1988:12). It is under such circumstances that "the limits on law themselves evolve" (Yeager 1991:16). While enforcement remains uncertain, what has been ac- complished over the past 25 years with regard to sanctioning marks a change in the legal landscape of corporate crime con- trol. This will inevitably have some affect on corporations and on the courts. Even laws widely recognized as weakly enforced lead to changes in corporate behavior, as is shown in Calavita's (1983) research on the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Statutory law provides a threshold for acceptable conduct. As such, its influence extends well beyond enforcement. The de- tailed definition of an adequate compliance plan, a prominent feature of the organizational sentencing guidelines, is espe- cially useful in this regard. To the extent that these plans are imposed prior to enforcement, they may serve to preempt criminal conduct. Finally, though organizational probation will</page><page sequence="35">Lofquist 775 certainly be less than fully enforced, it provides a statutory source of redress (Auerbach 1983; Thompson 1975); changing social conditions may enhance its prospects for future use. Stat- utory changes are the essential first step.
