<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS FICTION Love in the Ruins, by Walker Percy. Beguiling, tantalizing, and bizarre are the words perhaps best chosen to describe Mr. Percy's latest novel, an Orwellian fantasy placed in the near future, when destruction has been visited upon cities where grass grows in the streets, tendrils of vines thrust through loose mortar joints, and where ruin can be found everywhere. His brilliant satirical approach is chiefly sociological, for he is concerned most acutely by failures to solve problems confronting us on every hand, just as he is obviously amused by the absurdity of racial, religious, and political antagonisms, the folly of war, and, on a personal level, that fetish of contemporary civilization, that cure for all bodily ills and mental aberrations, the orgasm. On this last phenomenon he is not above outright travesty in giving the solemn Masters-John son pronouncements a decent perspective. And as though all these story elements might prove insufficient for his exacting and fastidious readers Mr. Percy then introduces a revolt of "Bantus" against the whites in Louisiana, and of course a "love" affair—all sex and no sentiment in high current style— all involving the half-mad, middle-aged, al coholic physician acting as protagonist, with his fearsome medical theories and his elab orate diagnostic device, also capable of some questionable treatments, called a Qualita tive Quantitative Ontological Lapsometer. Mr. Percy exposes with uncommon ease and a fine wit the decadence of the world about us. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $7.95 The Wintering, by Joan Williams. With tantalizing nostalgia for a vanished yesteryear Miss Williams recounts the story of a famous writer and his love affair with a young girl half his age, the one over whelmed by his all too acutely realized ad vancing years, the other by spectres of hopeless immaturity and inadequacy. Ten derness and compassion are projected on every page of a lyrical tale that could herald a return to delicacy in writing and a revival of that almost forgotten genre, the romance. Never maudlin nor mawkish, her obvious roman à clef is affecting in its simplicity, its indirectness, and its carefully modulated xcvi understatement of deeply experienced emo tion. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $7.50 The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath. So troubled was her brief life, so tragic her death, and so marked her talent that a natural tendency, out of sheer admiration mingled with pity, is to elevate her at once to the calendar of literary saints, but in truth her output as a writer was quite in considerable, and her range at best cir cumscribed. She wrote extremely well; her content was nevertheless almost entirely egocentric and heavily autobiographical, as the present reprint of her single novel first published in England some eight years ago clearly illustrates. Her account of a much disturbed psychoneurotic heroine, her loss of identity as an individual, her treatment in various institutions, and her possible re covery is handled with commendable sincerity, directness, and objectivity, giving us a book of superior quality at a time when good writing is conspicuously in short sup ply. Speculation about Miss Plath's sub sequent career had she lived is at best idle; we must content ourselves with this de monstrably fine example of her narrative skill. Harper &amp; Row $6.95 Something in the Wind, by Lee Smith. One aspect of Hemingway's technique is somewhat overworked in a yarn about an eighteen year old girl on the loose as a freshman in college: even though the girl herself is the narrator and all manner of events affect her, readers are given few in sights into her own character, her thinking, or her motivations. All we are really aware of is her meticulously cultivated approach to life, one that dissociates her from reality and permits her to regard herself as a sep arate being, thus able to participate in an action without personal involvement includ ing endless copulations with a succession of strangers. If the heroine's intellectual solu tion to the problems of living in a contem porary world is marked by considerable vacuity, at least her methods are marked by abandon, despair, vengeance, and a subcon scious wish to play Delilah to all men and symbolically emasculate each in turn, one by one. Harper &amp; Row $6.95</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Dance the Eagle to Sleep, by Marge Piercy. More of a tract than a novel, even though the book is fictional in form and in keeping with fashionable dictates of our time begins with an adolescent seduction and ends with a dramatic childbirth, this work describes a fanciful revolt by youngsters opposed to military service or any other discipline on such a gigantic scale that the whole coun try becomes involved. An unconscious par ody of all protest groups is the result, ab surdly portentous and a bit pontifical with these "communes," minimal planning, in competent leadership, tribal dances as a form of expression in public acknowledg ment of their simple inarticulateness, their predilection for body painting as an erotic stimulation, and practice of unlimited prom iscuity as a cure for all personal and social ills. In a technical sense there is no conclu sion to the opus, nor is any solution offered for the problems raised. Only the spectre of revolt is raised, but even this wraith is hardly enough to arouse any serious con sideration for a work so palpably evanescent and so manifestly a succès d'estime. Doubleday tS-95 Secrets, by Nancy Hale. The narrator of this story is a woman in middle life, a wife and mother, who tells how she grew from a lonely, sensitive child, the daughter of artists, into a mature adult capable of coping with past and present, of appraising herself and others objectively. During these years of growth the narrator experiences childhood and adolescence with the children next door, "the nearest to brothers and sisters" she ever had. There is far more to "Secrets," however, than the narrative. For in her story Miss Hale deals directly or obliquely with many matters: the difference between appearance and real ity, between imagination and fact, social and racial discrimination, the individual and the group. As her title announces, the story is also concerned with secrets, not only with childhood secrets such as secret draw ers and secret passages, but with the deeper and perhaps tragic secrets of later years and finally, with the great secret of all se crets, the riddle of life, which is only to be experienced, never solved. As usual, Miss Hale excels in brief description. There are the "round cheeks, button nose, prim, pursed mouth" of a friend, the devastating picture of a dreary street in the dusk of a winter af ternoon. "Secrets" is both light and somber, easy and difficult, but above all it is the work of a writer who has a special feeling for the conflict between the world within and the world without and who knows that we must learn to live with both worlds if we are to survive. Coward-McCann $4.9S The Brother, by F. D. Reeve. Four brothers growing up with a respec table middle-class background in a small New England town constitute Mr. Reeve's main concern as he depicts their emergence from adolescence into maturity. One of the youngsters is too young to require much attention in the story, and another is acci dentally killed early in the story when his hot rod fails to take a curve; the remaining two occupy the author until the elder com mits suicide, convinced he is a ne'er-do well, a misfit, and a drunkard. Although the surviving lad retains some equilibrium, there are Freudian overtones, possibly more intrusive than the writer intended. His book is a competent piece of work. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $6.1)5 Lion Country, by Frederick Buechner. Urbane, arcane, intelligent, low-keyed comedy is rare enough in these parlous times, but here from the unpredictable Mr. Buechner, whose style and approach vary from novel to novel, is a choice example certain to appeal to a variety of tastes. His protagonist becomes involved with the op erator of a diploma mill in Florida and his entourage of eccentrics; there are uproari ous episodes involving an oil-rich Indian from Texas anxious to be ordained in the Church of Holy Love; and there are to offset these a few serious moments in a New York hospital. Admirers of the author's work have a pleasant surprise awaiting them. Atheneum $5.95 The Tale of Asa Bean, by Jack Matthews. High-styled low comedy in prose fiction requires a sensitive, acutely apprehensive approach by the writer lest the mood, nec essarily sustained for page after page if any xcvii</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS success whatever be achieved, becomes lost in some careless moment; here the author writing spiritedly with tongue in cheek throughout juxtaposes his erudite but exces sively amorous hero with ever tumescent glands against the commonplace background of the warehouse where he works and from which he sallies to cavort with a sluttish waitress. His learning and prodigious vocab ulary only mystify her and his other uncomprehending auditors wherever en countered until he is seduced, not at all unwillingly by a voluptuous divorcée gifted enough to communicate without the need of any words whatever. Mr. Matthews is witty, urbane, civilized, vulgar, and in escapably funny. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $5.95 The Merry Month of May, by James Jones. Paris in the spring may be the usual time and place for a few friendly riots among students at the Sorbonne; in May of 1968 matters were serious indeed, when trees were cut down along the boulevards and barracades were erected in the streets from paving stones. Americans were among the expatriates who participated, according to the author, who recounts the episode in fictional form in his latest novel. Mr. Jones is careful to illustrate more explicitly than ever before the degree to which our new permissiveness has affected his craft, but for all that his story is an absorbing one that captures much Left Bank charm despite the violence and destruction inherent in revolu tionary machinations. As a record out of day-before-yesterday, his recital is sympa thetic and revealing. Delacorte $7.9j K, by William Wiser. In a brief, meticulously planned and re freshingly eloquent first novel the author illustrates how the death of a generally un recognized painter of some merit affected the lives of his friends and neighbors in Greenwich Village. Even though the figure about whom the book revolves makes his appearance indirectly through the eyes of these other persons, he nevertheless becomes recognizable, vivid, and acceptable as a mod est folk hero. Mr. Wiser's treatment is authoritative and affecting, giving promise on evidence almost too insubstantial to be definitive. Doubleday $5.95 Cony-Catching, by Kirby Farrell. In a first novel bearing superficial ear marks of professional competence the au thor analyzes at considerable length the complex relationships between a number of quasi-bohemian, pseudo-intellectuals living north of Boston in a circle where eccentric ity is mistaken for originality and simple vituperation for wit. Humor, when infre quently encountered among characters who take themselves with great seriousness, seems labored and unreasonably arch, but the most difficult obstacle offered by the author to any prospective reader is plain, overwhelming prolixity. Little narrative movement is supplied and its very lack adds torpidity to a book desperately in need of vitality. Atheneum $8.95 Sunshine, by Clifford Hägen. In telling his story through the eyes and ears of a small boy Mr. Hägen conceals to some extent the sordid nature of his ma terial, centered on the lad who in addition to his youth might possibly be an idiot, badgered in any event by a crippled, often cruel father, his grossly fat dissolute nurse and mistress, and a black attendant harried on all sides. Tangential to the tale is the boy's mother, a shadowy creature at best, and a brother now dead. Multiple shifts in time and constant wavering back and forth between reality and fantasy give the narra tive an ethereal quality that adds much to its effectiveness. Action, modest by any criterion, takes place on a West Florida island just off the coast, but locale itself is unimportant in a story so sensitively and imaginatively unfolded. Harper &amp; Row $5 Farragan's Retreat, by Tom McHale. Mr. McHale treads the thin line between the extremes of black comedy and foolish farce with the wildest abandon. He writes sometimes on one side of the line, some times on the other, and nobody can deny that he has the most fertile, though not necessarily the most admirable, imagination. In fact his fertile brain seems to be entirely occupied with anti-heroes of more than heroic size, all strident and all gesturing C</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS melodramatically as they leap onto the page. It is to Mr. McHale's credit that one can believe in these gigantic puppets as they perform their never ending tricks, but, alas, the diminuendo at the end is too sharp and too Shavian—Shaw always had trouble si lencing his characters after he had set them talking—to match the energy of the rest of the novel. Viking $6.95 The Truth about Dragons, by Hazard Adams. Anthropomorphism as an element in our culture is not entirely uncelebrated, from comic strips to fiction. In these pages we are introduced as a matter of fact to a centuries-old dragon, erudite beyond belief and much at home in our language as it should be spoken, in quite sharp contrast to the hippie-yippi female who discovers the mythical monster. One can share the au thor's enthusiasm for such unpromising material and can wholeheartedly admire his skill in weaving substance from shadow as his tale effortlessly unfolds and comes to its ingenious and acceptable conclusion. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $6.50 The Battle of Pharsalus, by Claude Simon. Of the French novelists who have come into prominence in the last twenty years, only two have emerged from the blurred crowd of new names as genuine artists, as writers of genuine wisdom and stature: Alain Robbe-Grillet and Claude Simon. Both are difficult writers, for they are test ing the very fiber and form of the novel with each book they write. Robbe-Grillet is better known because of his association with films, but Simon is as brilliant and exciting a writer and deserves a wider audi ence in this country than he has. "The Battle of Pharsalus" is his sixth novel, and it is a rich exemplification of the power of the imagination to create value in the flux of experience, to make the real from a con fusion of sensations, of percepts and con cepts. Like Robbe-Grillet's "In the Laby rinth" or Nabokov's "The Gift" and "Pale Fire" the novel becomes itself the tangible fact of the imagination of its central char acter. In it, O. the man without certain identity unravels his personal past and the larger past of Caesar's battle at Pharsalus, civ but he does not arrive at a static moment of truth but rather at an open door into the living future. By being able through an imaginative act to be both his wife in an adulterous sexual act and himself outside the door discovering her, he frees himself to be all men, to become not what the past made him, but whatever he chooses to be. Just as no memory or landmarks of the battle of Pharsalus exist in the present Greek town called the Battle of Pharsala, the past does not exist in O.'s present unless he chooses it, unless he transmutes it into words on the page as Caesar did in his war commentaries. One may believe Caesar or present fact. O. may believe in his present or allow himself to be locked in the past. He chooses the present in the form of the novel, "The Battle of Pharsalus." And by making that choice he creates the values of his own fu ture and influences those of us, the readers of the novel, as well. The novel is a brilliant book. Braziller $5.95 POETRY The Only World There Is, by Miller Wil liams. The new quality that the poems in Miller Williams' third book has is a deeper and richer maturity. Not that his poems were ever those of a callow youth, sentimental and romantic. They have always been the expressions of a vision which was able to see the gritty hardness of fact and yet still wish to go on seeing and saying. But in the new book he has grown more openly con scious of himself as a man aging in a world of continuing event. He seems impelled to offer to you more explicitly and clearly what he has seen and what he has learned. And the possibility of human connection, for however brief a time, seems more cen tral to him now than ever. These are fine poems, poems which take great chances and most often gain enormously for it. The poem, "July 20, 1969," is a remarkably effec tive rendering of the human response to the moon landing and of the heightened awareness which we all gained of ourselves as members of humanity on a planet, all of us alive at once, "one planet / perfect edges / blurred by the sun / spinning motionless through space / the first blue syllable of</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS the unspoken word." And all of the poems are engaging to the heart and mind, and especially the closing poems, a letter to his children and a love poem, both of them so aware and so very full of love and life. Miller Williams continues to be one of the most interesting poets writing today, aware and witty and wise, making his words and lines as solid as stone, as moving as water. Dutton $4.95; paper $2.45 The World Before Us: Poems 195:0-70, by Theodore Weiss. Here, gathered into one substantial vol ume, are selections from four of Theodore Weiss's five previous books of poems (the book-length poem, "Gunsight," is missing) and also twenty-three new poems, almost enough for a new book by themselves. Al together about a third of Weiss's earlier poems are in this book, including a number of his longer poems, among them, "Shades of Caesar," "The Visit," "Caliban Remem bers," and the important "Mount Wash ington." The book reveals Weiss's strengths and weaknesses, and the strengths certainly outweigh the flaws. And especially since he has learned in his most recent book, "The Last Day and the First," and in the new poems in this book to control his need to oversay a poem, to smother its lean identity in a thick padding of words and more words. But in the last half of this collection, there is scarcely a flaw. The language is as stark and strong as animal sinew; the mind has in them found its proper medium. All of which is not to deny that Weiss is a poet of talk not of images; his is a rational mind coming to grips with the puzzles of the day by talking them through. How pleasing, then, to see him in the poem "Yes, But.. pay homage to William Carlos Williams, who moved so very differently in his poems. And that is much of Weiss's success, his ability to think and write about such a great number of different things. Reading the book is an adventure, or better, a series of adventures, for Weiss constantly demands attention, and he is full of surprises of the most enlightening kind. The selected earlier poems show him to be a poet of genuine accomplishment; the new poems show him to be a poet who is still very much alive and well. The book is a good one, one well worth knowing. Macmillan $6.9$ For You, by Hayden Carruth. This book is a collection of five long poems by Hayden Carruth that have ap peared previously only in magazines or limited editions, one of them being the 1963 Balch prize winning poem, "North Win ter." They are, perhaps, Carruth's finest work, although his book-length sequence, "The Norfolk Poems," may hold that honor. In any case, these are major poems by a poet who has never received the wide acclaim his work deserves and who is cer tainly one of the most important poets working in this country today. And these five long poems show him at his best, tech nically skilled, lively, never less than com pletely honest, and as profound and deeply moving as one could ask. The speaker of the poems is a man who has been sorely wounded by life, but has found in that wounding the necessary strength to con tinue to live and more, to take deep joy in living, in the movement of seasons, the names and natures of birds and flowers, the hurting and loving of human beings. "Come," he says at the end of "Contra Mortem," the fourth of these poems, "let us sing against death." And sing that song he does, whether in the sharp descriptions of winter's coming and going in "North Winter," or in the moving farewell to his father in "My Father's Face"; he sings against death and for life always, life with all its hurt and sting, the nothing that is everything. Let us celebrate this book's ap pearance and hope that it will at last give to these fine poems the wide audience they so truly deserve. New Directions $5.95 News of the Nile, by Richard H. W. Dillard. This second volume of verse fulfils and goes beyond the promise of Dillard's first, "The Day I Stopped Dreaming about Bar bara Steele and Other Poems." The same qualities of rhythmic elegance, sonority, and a remarkable eye for fine detail are all here, only more refined, more steady, more ex pert. Dillard's verse has a rare combination of erudition, wit, and warmth. It is the poetry of one in love with life, willing to CV</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS accept its ugliness and pain as well as its beauty and joy, reveling in the concreteness of existence, in the remembered thrill of it all. "The eye of the reptile/ Winks like the moon/ Through thin clouds/Is cold as a dead bird/Will not leave you/To the dark alone." The title poem of the volume is as fine pure music as the "begats" of "Genesis" or the list of ships in the "Iliad." Through it all there is a kind of sadness that anything once a part of life should no longer be. But the poet's song can fetch it back to a kind of life. And that song can be shared lovingly between the listener and one who sings, "God bless/the reader of these names." North Carolina Î3.75 Margins, by Philip Booth. The excellent "Notes from a Distant Land" begins this sequence of half a hun dred old and new poems by Mr. Booth, the very able poet whose fine and stable spareness often generates good, mature poetry. In its themes, pace, and images this present collection is born out of the ground and sensibilities of New England and is con tent to linger there, occasionally wry, more often searching, sometimes in pain, some times in hope. Viking #5.55 Sky, by Michael Benedikt. These poems are not so much about sky as about things redeemed by buoyancy, things gaining skyworthiness by achieving levity: "I would like to present to this august gathering of all the dignified people on earth/A concrete proposal:/Everything must become lighter/All phenomena of flora and fauna." And, indeed, it is with playful conviction that Benedikt goes at this task of lévitation, doing his best to lighten what he considers the heavy bodies of the poetry of the Old Order. His poetics are given further definition in his little poem "On Earth": "The flowers of reality bloom when we pour over them the waters of our dreams." Some of the poems impress me as being a bit precious or cute, as was true of many of the poems in his previous collection "The Body." Nonetheless, the book will be a delight for the most part, for there seems to be a winning, though sometimes sly, smile behind the poems. Benedikt's imagination is boundless as the cvi sky, and his poetic leaps take the tallest buildings with ease. Wesley an $4; paper $2 Treasury Holiday, by William Harmon. Out of an amalgam composed of elements as various as the involved linguistic com merce of "Finnegans Wake," the expan siveness and frustration of "Howl," the droll seriousness of "The Dream Songs," Harmon strikes a coin bearing a profile that, despite diverse influences, is unmistakably original. The visage is clearly troubled by the Gross National Product and the fact that all is "subordinated quite to one gross &amp; national product in terms of/the lordly Long Green/money the only mother/ money the only poetry." The book, which won the 1970 Lamont Poetry Selection, em ploys much cataloguing, some of which tends toward extravagance. Finally, how ever, one accepts the extravagance and ran dom appropriations as part of Harmon's vision of America and the history that pro duced a GNP, which, the book concludes, "came from them/Him me you/O go down/On our/Knees/now." Wesley an $4; paper $2 Collected Poems, by Abbie Huston Evans. This very handsome volume brings to gether the three books of poems of Abbie Huston Evans along with a set of new poems, and it offers readers who may be unfamiliar with her work the opportunity to share the growth of a poet who has al ways been deeply involved in and with the natural world, but whose perceptions and whose poetic skill have increased from vol ume to volume. Abbie Huston Evans, whom Daniel Hoffman has called "the Marianne Moore of Pennsylvania," published her first book in 1928, her second in 1938, and her third in 1961. Her output, then, has not been prodigious, but it has been steady and sure. She has never paid much attention to poetic fashions, but she has paid attention to poetry—she has learned and grown and she has allowed the form and texture of her verse to grow with the poetry of her time. She is aware always of the emptiness of space and time in which life proceeds, but she can affirm the Tightness of things even as she is awed and shaken by them, as in the last poem in this collection: "Shaken by</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS terror and joy / I see I belong where I am, / Here in the whelming abyss / As it were in the crook of an arm." That honesty and that sureness of belief are the hallmarks of her poetry. Collected together, the poems of Abbie Huston Evans are a pleas ure to behold and to read and to understand. Pittsburgh $4.95 Love and Its Derangements, by Joyce Carol Oates. This is original poetry but it is not good poetry. The meter is unusual but in most places it is also defective not only in its rhythm but in the crucial relation of the sound of words to their meaning. "If there is a radiance in us/ it is only for others to see." There are interesting images but these are derivative—falling, the bone beneath the skin, blood, and silence—and repeated in the same way so often that surprise yields to tedium. The collection suffers most from a clever succession of contrivances, intro duced, perhaps, as a gesture toward interest or originality. They do not succeed. In stead, these thin surfaced poems leave us with a sense of disappointment at so little attempted and so little accomplished. Louisiana $4.50 Another Kind of Rain, by Gerald Barrax. Gerald Barrax is a black poet, and that fact is perfectly plain in his poems but only because he is a black man; his poems are the poems of a man who is black and often lonely, strong, sexual, hurt by a broken marriage, but they are never the polemical stances of a black public figure, the self consciously illiterate shouting which so many young black poets feel they have to do to be heard (and which the commercial publishers seem to be encouraging for the shock value involved). Gerald Barrax' first book of poems has been published by a university press which is making its name (and very successfully) by publishing good poetry, black or white so long as it is good. And the poems in Gerald Barrax' book are good. They are personal without the ex cesses of confessionalism, and they move from the rain of despair and loss to the healing rains of growth and new birth with an organic naturalness. Occasionally he slips and allows himself a cheapness of idea or expression, but the slips are very few, fewer than can usually be found in a first book. And the poems of sexual love are as vivid and fine as any have ever been, sensuous and honest and truly loving. Gerald Barrax is a young poet of great promise, worth reading and remembering. Pittsburgh $4.9Si paper $2.50 Whispers of Intimate Things, by Gordon Parks. Gordon Parks is that remarkable man—a person with a poetic intellect and a poetic eye. His color photographs soar with true visual intensity, while his poems, no matter how short, twist the mind into unexpected responses of pleasure. Nothing better can be said of this book of poem-pictures and picture-poems. Viking $8.95 On Barbara's Shore, by Diane Wakoski. This lovely three-part invention marks a new range in sensibility in this interesting poet. Published gratis, the handsome keep sake is the one hundredth publication of the Black Sparrow Press The Poetry of T'ao Ch'ien, translated with Commentary and Annotation by James Robert Hightower. This is another item in the very impres sive series, "Oxford Library of East Asian Literatures." The work is scholarly without being routine; the "author" mentions his efforts to revise his earlier versions to try "to make the English less wooden." On the whole, he has succeeded, especially in such poems as "On Naming My Son" and "Drinking Alone in the Rainy Season." Oxford $11.2j LITERARY STUDIES Orpheus in the Middle Ages, by John Block Friedman. This handsomely printed book is a valu able survey of late classical and medieval traditions concerning Orpheus. Professor Friedman's competent description of Or pheus in classical antiquity is followed by an entirely satisfactory discussion of the moral philosophical tradition deriving from Ful gentius and Boethius' "De Consolatione Philosophiae." Less happy, and less explic cviii</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON CURRENT ROOKS able, given the context of Boethius' refer ence to Orpheus' attempt to redeem Eury dice from Hell, is Friedman's discussion of a few Latin lyrics from which he derives an independent medieval tradition illustrating without irony the power of Cupid over the human heart. This misreading partially vitiates his fine discussion of "Sir Orfeo" and Henryson's "Orpheus and Eurydice." Nevertheless, this literary and iconographie study of the Orpheus legend makes a useful and exciting book. Harvcrrd $p Mysteriously Meant. The Rediscovery of Pagan Symbolism and Allegorical Interpre tation in the Renaissance, by Don Cameron Allen. This is a fascinating book, full of a re markable erudition about the responses of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scholars to classical art and literature. Professor Allen devotes chapters to renaissance re actions to pagan philosophy, to sacred his tory, and to the works of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid. A chapter on the antiquarians and their attempts to come to grips with ancient coins and medallions throws wel come new light into a little explored corner. In view of the short sketch on medieval commentaries on Ovid and Virgil and the pre-renaissance mythographers, it is difficult to comprehend the word "rediscovery" in the book's title, but that is a minor quarrel with this immensely learned and useful sur vey of renaissance scholarship. Johns Hopkins $12 Transformations in the Renaissance English Lyric, by Jerome Mazzaro. This glibly written book has as its "major concerns" the "various transformations that the English lyric experienced during the sixteenth century." It contains five chap ters: "Res-Verba Relations," "The Message and the Medium," "Toward Originality," "New Alliances," and "John Donne." These are primarily compilations of secondary source materials, most of which are familiar to specialists in the field. The procedure of quoting from these sources is described on die dust-jacket as "a technique of using multiple voices." Scholars who seek a new understanding of the lyrics themselves will find little to reward them in this work. And although it is quite short, one cannot avoid the feeling that it should have been much shorter. Cornell $6.7$ The Language of History in the Renais sance, by Nancy S. Struever. During much of Western man's academic existence the study of classical rhetoric has been a central area of concern. The doc trines of rhetorical invention, style, and ar rangement posited by Aristotle and ex panded by Latin rhetoricians such as Cicero were central to the training of an educated man. Struever has now clearly demonstrated the intimate relationship between rhetoric and history—as well as other arts—in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Her first chapter provides the classical background necessary for understanding rhetoric's rôle in society and examines the influence of rhetoric on Greek and Roman historical writings. The last three chapters are de voted to the relationship of rhetoric and history as seen through three Florentine Chancellors—Coluccio Salutati, Leonardo Bruni, and Poggio Bracciolini. The individ ual chapters concerning each man's view of the interrelationship of rhetoric and his tory—such as Bruni's use of rhetoric's func tion in determining "alternative possibili ties"—indicate that in order to understand Italian renaissance history properly the strong influence of rhetoric upon history in that age must be first grasped. Princeton $6.$5 Marvell's Pastoral Art, by Donald M. Fried man. Professor Friedman writes from the con viction that "all of Marvell's good poetry responds in some degree to the demands of the pastoral vision," a vision shaped not only within the narrow genre of the pas toral but also by the pastoral mode as "a paradigm of evaluative experience." The pastoral mode reflects Europe's complex re sponse to man's fall from Eden and the difficult ramifications of the consequent un steadiness in the union of soul and body. Mr. Friedman has interesting things to say about the pastoral mode, more interesting suggestions about the impact of the Cam bridge Platonists on Marvell's thought, but the chief and not inconsiderable value of cix</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS this book lies in the sensitive and intelligent explication of the poetry. California $6-95 The Resolved Soul: A Study of Marvel?s Major Poems, by Ann E. Berthoff. Mrs. Berthoff is concerned to establish the grand theme running through Marvell's poetry and finds it in the image of the reso lute soul, mediator in "the absolute disparity of heaven and earth." Marvell's imagination, itself essentially allegorical and emblemat ical in its mode of apprehension, was, she argues persuasively, gripped by the idea of man's ability through Christian fortitude— wit, love, and heroic action—to counter a world seemingly governed by fate. There are inevitable distortions in a study which insists upon a single perspective, most nota bly in her discussion of "The Unfortunate Lover," but Mrs. Berthoff has tact, and she can read poetry. Princeton $7.50 The Augustan Milieu, edited by Henry Knight Miller, Eric Rothstein, and G. S. Rousseau. This is a festschrift to Louis Landa, a tribute by his friends and students. It con tains seventeen essays covering the period from Dryden to Johnson, and five of these are on Swift, quite rightly supporting the central interest of Professor Landa's schol arship. Individual authors that are discussed include Dryden, Defoe, Bishop Berkeley, Pope, Fielding, Smart, and Johnson. Two essays deal with general subjects: "Aspects of Sentimentalism in Eighteenth-Century Literature" and "Satire and Economics in the Augustan Age of Satire." The latter essay, by the economist Jacob Viner, is among the most provocative in the volume and offers a challenge to literary critics and historians to discover why Augustan satire, in contrast to satire in other periods, was not used to urge action against poverty, misery, and the social degradation of the depressed masses. It is a sign of the appro priateness of the gift to Professor Landa that it serves to encourage research and scholarship. Oxford $7.50 Energy and the Imagination: A Study of the Development of Blake's Thought, by Morton D. Paley. What is best and what is most problèm es atical in this book are closely allied. The author starts by calling Blake the first "critic of civilization to endorse the subversive na ture of the claims of energy." This is the Blake of the "Marriage," with which, ac cording to Paley, "the study of Blake's thought begins," and "The Songs of Expe rience." The book then traces Blake's grow ing skepticism about the regenerative possi bilities of energy and his consequent raising of the imagination, which Paley distin guishes importantly from the "poetic ge nius" of the "Marriage" period, to the posi tion of redeemer. Paley tries throughout to place Blake not only in the context of the thought of his own period, but in relation to modern thought as well, a broad cultural orientation which one finds refreshing after the minutely recondite nature of much re cent Blake scholarship. At the same time, however, the brush storkes are at times ap plied too broadly, and relevant critical prob lems are painted over in Paley's prosecution of a convincing, if not terribly original, thesis. To some extent, this is probably un avoidable and the result of conscious choice. In any case, the book does what it claims to do: it gives an informed and cogent sense of the development of Blake's thought. Oxford $9 Blake's Visionary Forms Dramatic, edited by David V. Erdman and John E. Grant. Blake criticism has undergone remarkable transformations, for it has swung from em phasizing his illustrative art to emphasizing his poetic art and back again. Now, at last, a series of essays concerning the depen dence of one on the other has been brought out. As a Blake-watcher of long standing, one would judge that this is the way it should have been all along, for surely that was the way Blake himself thought of his poems which were almost never written down without a set of accompanying im ages. His vision, both literary and pictorial, seems to be built on layers of meaning and, of course, it is this profundity which has sometimes alarmed and frequently fasci nated scholars. The present volume, richly illustrated, captures both reactions, but is in itself full of profound insights into the mind which was so marvelously stored. Princeton $20</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS The Structure of "Leaves of Grass," by Thomas Edward Crawley. Many students of Whitman's poem have addressed themselves to the problem of the structure of "Leaves of Grass," but no one has undertaken so thorough a study as this by Mr. Crawley. Accepting Whitman's statement that with the edition of 1881 "Leaves of Grass" was complete and that any later poems he might write must be published in annexes, Mr. Crawley pro ceeds, by a careful analysis of the poems and a comparison of the several editions (1855, 1856, i860, 1867, 1872, 1876, and 1881), to show the bases of the final unity of the book and the steps by which it evolved. He finds the pervading spirit of "Leaves of Grass" to be religious and the Christ-symbol a central one. Although the early editions lack the structural symmetry and completeness of the 1881 edition, he presents convincing evidence that the germ of the final form must have existed in Whit man's mind from the beginning. The au thor's argument is presented in an interest ing and cogent manner, his style is smooth and clear, and though there may be a few problems that he has not fully resolved, the book is excellent and is bound to have a stimulating impact on Whitman scholarship of the future. Texas $7.50 Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales, edited by William L. Howarth. This little volume contains fourteen es says, or parts of essays, all of them interest ing, and most of them published within the last ten or fifteen years. Doubtless limita tions on the size of the book precluded the inclusion of others that might have been equally interesting. Some of them contain new and useful ideas. The two essays on "The Fall of the House of Usher" by I. M. Walker and John S. Hill are especially good. But probably the editor's introduc tion is the best thing in the book, both for its good sense in interpretation and for its excellent style. Prentice-Hall $4.9;; paper $1.4; The Moral Art of Dickens, by Barbara Hardy. With her usual critical perceptiveness, Barbara Hardy discusses Dickens' work as representative of the Victorian moral art of fiction. The morality of Dickens' art consists of a powerfully radical criticism of society combined with a concern with individual moral psychology. It is the latter aspect of his art which provides the focus for the general section of this book; the sec ond half is devoted to readings of individ ual novels. In examining the Dickensian be lief in the power of the individual in a corrupt world, Hardy reveals many of the ways in which Dickens is unique among Victorian novelists. But he is not at his fin est or most perceptive in his treatment of individual virtue, which is often crude or sentimental; it is therefore to be regretted that Miss Hardy did not devote at least a portion of this excellent critical work to his "sociological imagination," that aspect of Dickens' art in which he clearly stands above his contemporaries. Oxford f6 Approaches to "Ulysses": Ten Essays, ed ited by Thomas F. Staley and Bernard Ben stock. This is a collection of essays on James Joyce's "Ulysses" by noted Joyce scholars. Each strikes out in his own direction, and most explore the novel in interestingly orig inal ways. Despite the voluminous criticism already in print, this is, oddly enough, the first volume of critical essays by diverse authorities devoted solely to "Ulysses." The quality is variable, and there is no central focus to the volume. On the other hand, contributions such as Fritz Senn's on the translations of "Ulysses" and David Hay man's on "Penelope" will remain important touchstones for years to come. Recom mended reading for those wishing to keep up on Joyce. Pittsburgh $7.9s The Universe Makers: Science Fiction To day, by Donald A. Wollheim. Donald A. Wollheim is one of the men responsible for the availability and the grow ing respectability of science fiction today. As a long-time "fan" and then as editor of Ace Books during the 1950's when Ace and Ian Ballantine were keeping science fiction alive in this country, he has done great serv ice to the literature that he admires so much. But his critical survey of modern science fiction is sadly lacking, for he is cxi</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS too much an advocate, too much a fan to be able to see either the genre or the par ticular works within it with any kind of objectivity. He argues for the writers he published a bit too vigorously to be con vincing, and he lacks the objectivity to ex plain the peculiar nature of science fiction as an imaginative art which usually holds imagination and art in low regard and ex tols the virtues of logic and reason. Cer tainly science fiction does need explaining, but by claiming Nabokov's "Ada" as a sci ence fiction novel without even trying to determine in what ways it is and isn't strictly science fiction, Wollheim carries us no closer to an understanding of the form. The book is interesting as a quick survey of some modern science fiction writers, but we still have to wait for a book which really gets at this subject in any valuable way. Harper &amp; Row $4.95 The Stubborn Structure: Essays on Criti cism and Society, by Northrop Frye. These essays show Northrop Frye rang ing from theoretical inquiries about the nature of creativity and problems of value, to studies in Milton, Romanticism, Dickens, and Yeats. They reveal the unusual range of his mind and his remarkable knowledge of the corpus of English literature, his sharp wit and skillful pen. Frye once again insists that "the notion that I belong to a school or have invented a school of mythical or archetypal criticism reflects nothing but confusion about me... I hold no 'method' of criticism beyond assuming that the struc ture and imagery of literature are central considerations of criticism." If these consid erations can lead to the insights of Northrop Frye, more critics ought to adopt them. Cornell $8.50 Styles in Fictional Structure, by Karl Kroe ber. In this book, Professor Kroeber has in vestigated the internal structure of the works of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and George Eliot. With various techniques including the almost inevitable use of a com puter, he has tried to examine the linguistic patterns of these three authors. Among other facets, Kroeber has analyzed the use of words by each author, the forms of char cxii acterization utilized by each, their usages of image and metaphor. Nearly one third of the book is devoted to mathematical tables and summaries of all kinds of data, literally dissecting the works of these authors to come to grips with the minutest details of craftsmanship. This kind of treatment of great works of literature seems to lose sight of the reasons for greatness. The worth of the whole is after all greater than a mere assemblage of words. However, this kind of analysis is being widely used today for all types of literature, including the Bible, and will undoubtedly continue. Princeton $11 Poetry in East Germany, by John Flores. Mr. Flores, who is a professor of German at Stanford, has assembled a survey of the output of the poets writing in East Ger many between 1945 and 1970. During a Fulbright grant to Berlin in 1966-67, he had the opportunity to meet many of the writers he discusses. He chooses to focus in detail on eight poets. Following the intro ductory section, he considers Stephen Herm lin and Franz Fümann in Part One titled Adjustments, which is approximately con cerned with the period 1945 to 1955. Part Two, Visions, concerned with the late i9jo's and early 1960's, is devoted to a rather detailed discussion of the work of Peter Hüchel and Johannes Bobrowski. In the final section, Revisions, Flores considers four writers, Günter Kunert, Volker Braun, Karl Mickel, and Wolf Biermann. One may crit icize the choice of poets selected in this survey, which is not intended to be a com prehensive literary history. Time will be needed to assess the lasting importance of these writers, but this book, one of the se ries of Yale Germanic Studies, does much to fill a gap for the time being. Yale $12.50 LIVES &amp; LETTERS The Rise of Warren Gamaliel Harding, 1865-1920, by Randolph C. Downes. The opening of the Warren G. Harding Papers in 1964 resulted in a spate of books about the tragic or, as some would prefer, pathetic former President in the last six years. First came Andrew Sinclair's breezy survey, "The Available Man," which could have been written without use of the Papers.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS It was followed by Francis Russell's scin tillating but poorly proportioned best-seller, "The Shadow of Blooming Grove." Then, last year, Robert K. Murray produced a scholarly, full-bodied, and quite sympathetic re-evaluation of Harding's presidency, "The Harding Era." Now Randoph C. Downes has come in with a comprehensive, extraor dinarily detailed account of Harding the working politician through his election as President. Though he gives Harding good scores as a politician, his appraisal of his policy views is harsh: "The political career of Warren G. Harding up to 1920 reveals a man whose growth . . . was confined to his evolution from a booster of progress for Marion, Ohio to a promoter of the limited view of 'Prosper America First.' " Ohio State $17.50 Pacifist's Progress: Norman Thomas and the Decline of American Socialism, by Bernard K. Johnpoll. When one thinks of American socialism he almost immediately also envisions Nor man Thomas. While Thomas became a le gitimate American folk hero, the Socialist Party which he represented became irrele vant. "Pacifist's Progress" is an attempt to understand the contradiction between myth ical hero and political failure. Working from impressive documentation Johnpoll argues that Thomas, although a skilled cam paigner, was not a political man. The so cialist's instinct was not that of a politician, but that of a Social Gospel evangelist. What American socialism needed in the 1920's and 1930's was a strong political leader to keep the right and left wings of the move ment from tearing it apaxt. Thomas was not that man. His heart was too Christian. Too often he followed the factionalist's lead rather than lead the factions. Division, weak leadership, Roosevelt, and the war de stroyed socialism. Thomas's appeal for the intelligent and good, however, won him universal respect. Johnpoll's conclusion is that "Thomas's failure as a politician was merely a reflection of his success as a hu man being." Quadrangle $8.95 Outsider in the Senate: Senator Clinton Anderson's Memoirs, by Clinton P. Ander son with Milton Viorst. Crowding thirty years of public service into a three hundred page book, the Senator from New Mexico notes that he narrates only the highlights—"an essay rather than an encyclopedia." In so doing, he omits much that would be interesting, enlighten ing, and enjoyable. He mentions his New Deal agency days in Albuquerque only in passing and hurries through his House career. He pauses briefly to discuss his rôle as Secretary of Agriculture under Truman but leaves many questions unanswered. He may be correct in claiming that Truman's victory in the farm belt in 1948 was a vote of confidence in his policies, but he does not tell the story of agriculture in the years 1945-1948 which would help to substantiate his statement. Anderson's enjoyment of his years in the Senate is obvious from the increased writer-interest in this material. He provides insight into the incredible horse trading that goes on in the Senate in the name of statesmanship, but most revealing is his view of the AEC and its controversial chairman Lewis Strauss, whom Anderson later successfully opposed as Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce. The Senator was not really an "outsider." The legislative his tory of acts dealing with public power, conservation, and Medicare shows that he has been a Senator who wielded consider able power during the past two decades. The anecdotes are mixed. Some are ex tremely revealing and others are banal. The sketch of Senator Robert Kerr as "King of the Senate" is so vivid that one wishes Anderson had used the same powers of recollection and description to write a longer, in-depth report of his own career. World $10 McClure's Magazine and the Muckrakers, by Harold S. Wilson. Believing that the "muckrakers were the heralds of a new social order," Wilson has written a history of the leading figures in the muckraking movement. Angered by the exploitation and corruption of the nation by a financial-political oligarchy, the Mc Clure's group of writers, of which Tarbell, Steffens, White, and Baker are the most notable, tried to halt the destruction of the country by bringing the oligarchy's abuses to the attention of the people. Wilson traces McClure's persuasive efforts during the first cxvi</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS decade of the century in an admirable story of literary propagandists. The reader's con clusion is that McClure and his group were writers of vigor and merit. So, it appears, is Wilson. Princeton fio Man on Fire: John Brown and the Cause of Liberty, by Jules Abels. During the recent events of the Civil Rights movement, historians have spent much time in re-evaluating the actors and events of another movement toward that end—the American Civil War. John Brown, perpetrator of the Pottawatomie massacre and organizer of the ill-fated Harper's Ferry raid, is no exception and, like other aboli tionists, he is receiving a decidedly revision ist treatment that tries to seek both weak nesses and strengths but that comes down strongly on Brown's positive contributions. Jules Abels has entered into this debate and has presented a picture of Brown that shows a complicated man, one driven by intense religious and emotional concern for the freedom of the slave. Much of what Brown did—his financial manipulations, his deceit, his rôle in "bloody Kansas"—was frankly il legal, and for this he is condemned by Abels. Ultimately, too, Brown's efforts failed, and were perhaps misguided, but Brown was not insane, nor is he to be dismissed in the events leading to the Civil War as some historians have tended to dismiss him. Lack ing scholarly apparatus, Abels nevertheless presents a scholarly view of John Brown, one that will be of use to both historian and interested reader. Mac?nillan $12.50 The Memoirs of Chief Red Fox. These memoirs of a sensitive and expe rienced man (the centenarian nephew of Crazy Horse) begin with the Custer Mas sacre, move through episodes of seafaring, touring, and appearing with Bualo Bill, and at length come to focus on the deplorable modern history of the American Indian, all the time communicating what it means to be an Indian. The Wounded Knee massacre occupies one good part of the book, and the modern reservation another. This is no radical treatise—altogether the book has a depth and eloquence beyond its simple prose. McGraw-Hill $6.95 Biographic Dictionary of Chinese Commu nism, 1921-1965, by Donald W. Klein and Anne B. Clark. China studies have been an underdeveloped field. Basic tools of the trade, taken for granted in other areas of scholarship, are only now becoming available. Howard Boorman's four-volume "Biographical Dic tionary of Republican China" (1967-71) marked a major breakthrough for the 1911 1949 era. Now Klein and Qark have pro vided an indispensable biographical refer ence for the overlapping history of Chinese Communism. Rather than duplicate the ex tensive but superficial coverage of existing Who's Who's, this work gives detailed treatment to 433 of the most prominent figures in the annals of the Chinese Com munist movement. Its utility is enhanced by the addition of 96 appendices and a 1,750-item glossary-name index. History, alas, moves faster than the publishing busi ness. The Cultural Revolution (1966-69) brought a wholesale upheaval in the ranks of Peking leadership. Though it is too early to know how much permanent damage has been done to the Klein-Clark hierarchy, we may hope that a supplementary volume to this invaluable work will be forthcoming. Harvard 2 volumes $30 Savonarola and Florence: Prophecy and Patriotism in the Renaissance, by Donald Weinstein. The author of this authoritative study de picts the prophet of Florence against the background of Florentine culture. It was, he argues, the impact of Florence on Savonarola that changed the apocalyptical prophet of doom into a millennial optimist. One should recognize that the inner logic of his millenarianism would have pushed the Dominican from Ferrara in this direction without the influence of Florentine ideas on him. But Weinstein's book stands as the most impressive analysis of the man and his city available. Princeton $13.50 Letters of Thomas Mann, 1889-1955, se lected and translated from the German by Richard and Clara Winston. The letters of Thomas Mann provide a picture of the artist at work from 1889 to 1955, the year of his death. This intelligent cxvii</page><page sequence="14">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS selection emphasizes Mann's devotion to literature and his articulation of his values. In 1935, for example, he wrote: "Almost alone among German writers, I have with all my might assailed the forces that have been emerging in Germany for years and have now attained absolute power, and my present exile, half voluntary, half involun tary, simply represents the outcome of that struggle." The estrangement that the exile feels in a sympathetic though foreign coun try and the attempt to cling to one's group despite dislocation are recurrent themes in the correspondence, as is the artist's self preservation by involvement in his work. The letters reveal once again the helpless ness of Mann and his friends in trying to understand the abandonment of humanistic values in what they took to be an enlight ened society. These letters are immensely valuable for understanding Mann, his work and times. Knopf $17.50 The Life and Destiny of Isak Dinesen. Text by Clara Svendsen; photographs collected and edited by Frans Lasson. Isak Dinesen's life was in itself a kind of gothic tale. Born into a family which was half grand and half merchant, her father commited suicide when she was a child, for reasons hinted at but never proved. Edu cated at home and at various art schools, she married a nobleman who promptly took her to Kenya where their families financed a coffee farm for them. Her own health began to break, the farm was unsuccessful, her husband left her, and she was forced to return to Denmark and the support of her family. In turning to writing, her first suc cess came in English, a success which made her independent financially, although she remained attached to her father's house. As fame increased health decreased and she visibly fades away in the last third of the book. All of this tragic life is laid out here photographically and in the captions by her former secretary so excellently that one would say that the visible part of her life had been definitively presented. Random $15 The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Volume VIII, edited by William H. Gilman and J. E. Parsons. Slowly but steadily the production of this magnificent monument to Emerson pro ceeds, the edition when completed to con sist of sixteen volumes. Each volume seems more valuable and more interesting than the last. Volume VIII consists primarily of those journals and notebooks made by Emerson during the years 1841-1843, when he had reached or was about to reach the peak of his literary achievement. These are the years when he wrote many of his greatest essays, began to be known nationally as a distin guished lecturer, and became editor of the Dial after the resignation of Margaret Ful ler. The editorial method is the same as established in the earlier volumes, with a few necessary adjustments to Emerson's varying method of note-taking. The editors must be commended again for their excel lent and thorough work. Harvard $18.50 Self-Interviews, by James Dickey. James Dickey faced a rough outline and a tape recorder and talked for a week on his development as poet and on his poems. He is never less than interesting throughout this small volume as he poses or suggests many questions while giving or suggesting answers. The basic tension involves the "au thoritative" and well stated "explanations" of poems, their genesis, intention, or mean ing. These explanations have a curious force of their own that almost damages the poems, yet ultimately, what do the interviews tell us about the poetry? Or should the ques tion be, what do they tell us of the poet? An attractive volume with a useful index. Doubleday $5.95 Richard Eberhart: The Progress of an Amer can Poet, by Joel Roache. It is heartening to see a critical biography of Richard Eberhart in print, for he has never received the critical attention which his work has earned. But Joel Roache's re vised doctoral dissertation does not do his subject justice. He does get the facts down, where Eberhart was from year to year, what the reviewers had to say about his books, and matter of that sort. (Although even as an account of the recorded events of Eberhart's life the book falters, for it stops abruptly in 1961 and pays no real at tention at all to two of Eberhart's most im portant books, "The Quarry" (1964) and "Shifts of Being" (1968).) The major flaw CXX</page><page sequence="15">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS of the book is that nowhere in it does Eber hart the visonary appear, the man who sees and writes at his best "at the Pitch that is near Madness," the poet of almost over whelming joy and vitality. Professor Roache sees Eberhart as a man torn by a conflict between vision and a fear of death, but even when he discusses particular poems in his introduction, he can never see the exciting fusion of those polarities in the poems. In stead he concentrates on Eberhart's financial problems and his worries about publication, and somehow he manages to miss both the man and the poet who is the man. The book is nevertheless valuable, for it makes a large amount of material easily available, and it is at least a start. But such a weak start. We can only hope that someone will pick up soon where Professor Roache left off. Oxford $8.50 HISTORY Grand Old Party: Political Structure in the Gilded Age, 1880-1896, by Robert D. Marcus. This is political history brought up to date conceptually. For some years now his torians have been doing the kind of hard, statistical voter analysis they once eschewed. Using this research as a jumping-off place, they have been revaluating city, state, and regional politics. They have also analyzed city machines, state parties, and the United States Senate as institutions. Now Robert D. Marcus has examined the structure of the G.O.P. during the last two decades of the nineteenth century in this closely rea soned and clearly written, if somewhat dull, monograph. His conclusions: the National Republican Party was a surprisingly loose and amorphous organization through most of the period; cultural issues were more im portant than economic issues for most vot ers; Mark Hanna did not so much initiate as direct the critically important activiza tion of corporations in Republican politics in the mid-nineties. Oxford $7.95 Autumn of Glory: The Army of Tennes see, 1862-186s, by Thomas Lawrence Con nelly. Mr. Connelly has collected massive amounts of data, has ably worked his way through the often conflicting testimony of battle reports, and through the maze of historical myth and literature that has come from the western armies of the Confeder acy. This large and difficult undertaking has resulted in an interesting, well written, and much needed history of the Army of Tennessee. Stressing the personalities of the war, Connelly underscores the problem of command in the western theatre. With fas cinating detail, he outlines the rôles of Brax ton Bragg, Joseph E. Johnston, John B. Hood, and Jefferson Davis and gives each his share of the responsibility for all that befell the Army of Tennessee from Mur freesboro (1862) to final surrender at Greensboro. For all of this, Connelly hesi tates to go beneath the line of command. One has the feeling that the entire war ef fort rested in the hands of the commanders. What of the common soldiers, their morale, their fighting strength? While occasional reference is made to these facets of the army's difficulties, it is usually when the army undergoes one of its frequent com mand changes. Because of this neglect, the book remains a detailed study in command but is disappointing as a history of the Army of Tennessee. Louisiana $15 Iron Afloat: The Story of the Confederate Armorclads, by William N. Still, Jr. This scholarly work begins with a de scription of the construction, commission ing, and career of the Confederate ironclad Virginia, then moves on to similar develop ments for the many other vessels planned or put in service by the Southern Navy, revealing in particular the frustrations of acquiring armaments in an industry-poor nation. As well, Dr. Still describes numerous sources which have received little attention by previous scholars, using as he does a ref erence system which encourages further re search by the interested Civil War buff or student of military history and naval tech nology. Vanderbilt $10 The British Empire before the American Revolution. Volume XV. A Guide to Man uscripts Relating to the History of the Brit ish Empire, 1148-1176, by Lawrence Henry Gipson. This is the concluding volume of one of cxxii</page><page sequence="16">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS the great feats of American historical schol arship in the twentieth century. Gipson has devoted fifteen volumes to the history of the British Empire before the American Revolution. In the current volume he sur veys the manuscript sources for his subject, having devoted volume fourteen of the se ries to a bibliographical guide to printed materials. There are specific and detailed discussions of manuscript depositories in London, the English counties, Wales, Scot land, Ireland, France, Spain, Canada, the Atlantic and West Indies Islands, and the United States. The description of the Lon don material occupies about sixty per cent of the volume. This is an immensely valu able contribution, especially for the young scholar perplexed by the variety of non American archival sources for the study of early American history. Knopf $15 The Laws of Virginia: Being a Supplement to Hening's The Statutes at Large, 1700 1750, compiled by Waverly K. Winfree. The collection of legislative acts of the General Assembly of Virginia which Wil liam Waller Hening published in 1809-1823, commonly called "The Statutes at Large," did not include the whole of all laws passed by the Assembly in 1623-1792, the period Hening aimed to cover in his thirteen vol umes. Mr. Winfree's supplement to Hen ing's "Statutes" supplies the full text for 178 of the 616 acts and ordinances passed be tween 1700 and 1750: four acts which Hen ing abridged, 158 acts and ordinances which he cited by title only, sixteen acts and or dinances which he left out altogether. The transcriptions have been made with scru pulous care, but with a minimum of edi torial intervention. Bibliographical notes provide exact citations of the manuscript originals, with summaries of annotations or endorsements that record the passing and subsequent history of the acts and ordi nances, and there is a useful index. Mr. Winfree's "Laws of Virginia" is an indi spensable enlargement of Hening's "Stat utes," and a handsome addition to primary sources for the history of Virginia. Virginia fis Poverty in New York, 1783-1825, by Ray mond A. Mohl. The transformation of the eighteenth century town into the nineteenth-century mercantile city furnishes a staple theme for American urban history. Historians have come to view this transition as the destruc tion of a community which had fulfilled comprehensively the needs of its members, and the emergence of a collectivity of as sociations which met those needs only par tially. This new volume in Richard Wade's Urban Life in America series approaches urban philanthropy as an aspect of the crea tion of a big city. The author effectively combines the story of proliferating welfare agencies with an analysis of shifting reform ideologies. Thus Mr. Mohl shows how the erosion of communal forms of welfare led to new doctrines of moral stewardship for the poor. To be one's brother's keeper, in turn, served to establish order in the city. As the Society for the Prevention of Pov erty claimed m 1823, stability could be re stored to a distended society "by inculcating religion, morality, sobriety, and industry, and by diffusing useful knowledge among the indigent and laboring people." Oxford $8.fo Preconditions of Revolution in Early Mod ern Europe, edited by Robert Forster and Jack P. Greene. It would be a mistake to classify all the revolts and rebellions of early modern Eu rope as true revolutions. The distinguished contributors to this symposium avoid this pitfall admirably and present a valuable comparative view of the Revolt of the Netherlands (J. W. Smit), the English Rev olution (L. Stone), the Fronde (R. Mous nier), revolts against the Spanish Monarchy (J. H. Elliott), and Pugachev's Rebellion (M. Raeff). Although no general rules of revolution emerge, the editors are to be congratulated for sharpening the issues. Johns Hopkins $8.9; The Conservative Party from Peel to Churchill, by Robert Blake. This is no ordinary party history. Based on the prestigious Ford Lectures at Oxford, the book ably traces the political develop ment of not only the Conservative Party but of England itself. Although based pri marily on a perceptive reading of the sec ondary literature, the work nevertheless cxociii</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS brings new insights to bear on such tradi tionally controversial subjects as the Con servative party's rôle in the Corn Law crisis of 1846 or Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policies at Munich in 1938. Blake is at his literary best, as is fitting for the biographer of both Disraeli and Bonar Law, in his frequent yet short personality sketches and in his sensitive portrayal of the complex political forces at work in nineteenth and twentieth century England. St. Martin's $12.50 The Napoleonists: A Study in Political Dis affection, 1760-1960, by E. Tangye Lean. Men and women such as Charles Fox, Samuel Whitbread, Lloyd George, Lord Byron, and Caroline of Brunswick have often been treated by biographers or his torians but rarely has that treatment come under the same cover. Nevertheless, Mr. Lean has culled from the lives of these seemingly disparate figures certain Napo leonist tendencies which lend themselves to comparison and which, furthermore, con tributed to the political disaffection of each. For example, all shared an unshakable belief in their fathers' "love of humanitarian causes"; or all had tendencies toward ruth lessness or violence (often culminating in suicide). Mr. Lean offers his Napoleonist syndrome as a paradigm for English oppo sition and political disaffection. While there are obvious exceptions to the pattern, and the author is fully aware of these, the idea of placing such disaffection into a paradigm is both novel and entertaining, although not entirely convincing. Because the author is aware of the limitations of his paradigm the book provides interesting reading for the scholar and delightful entertainment to the layman who is interested in English history. Oxford Î12.is The Emerging City: Paris in the Age of Louis XVI, by Leon Bernard. This scholarly and lucid volume is a his tory of the development of Paris at this time, and it underlines the scope of the problem that has beset city planners ever since: by giving the capital the amenities of urban life in one generation, it attracted a population whose rapid growth would only compound the urban problems in the next. Duke $10 Pont-de-Montvert: Social Structure and Pol itics in a French Village, 1700-1914, by Pa trice L.-R. Higonnet. Just as French historians have begun to define history as retrospective cultural an thropology, so American students of French society have moved toward a holistic view of their task. Mr. Higonnet's brief study of a village in south central France is a be ginning effort to illuminate some larger themes through local study. The history of Pont-de-Montvert is, in brief compass, the story of the decline of a hierarchical society and the disappearance of deference. During the reign of Louis XIV, the rich collabo rated with the monarchy while the poor rebelled. But during the eighteenth century, the distinction between the politics of rich and poor waned, so that by 1789 both bour geois notables and peasants detested the cen tral government. The early nineteenth cen tury saw the collapse of the traditional class structure. As the social basis of deference disappeared, then, the new politics assumed an ideological structure. Harvard $8.50 Latin-American Political Thought and Ide ology, by Miguel Jorrin and John D. Martz. This survey of Latin American political thought begins with the Enlightenment, skips lightly through the nineteenth century, and emerges from the twentieth century with an account of ideologies of moderniza tion. Professors Jorrin and Martz provide useful overviews of particular developments, notably of Positivism and of Social Democ racy in Venezuela. The account, however, lacks any consistent effort to integrate bare ideological statements within an institutional context. Thus the reader often loses a sense of the social determinants of intellectual developments, surely an important aspect of a book which aims to give a coherent view of the development of ideological con flict. The attention given to the role of the intellectual in Professor Martz's Introduc tion might have provided one means of de veloping the social history of Latin Ameri can thought, but the book as a whole lacks any such focus. North Carolina $12.50 cxxvi</page><page sequence="18">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS The Romans, by Donald R. Dudley. This book is the seventh in a series en titled "The History of Human Society," and as such it is described by the editor, J. H. Plumb, as "one of the key volumes of the series, because the subject is still so cen tral to all our lives." More than that, how ever, it is a truly masterful book, synthesiz ing an immense amount of diverse material so skillfully as never to lose the sense of movement and direction, and to afford the reader a panoramic view of the Roman world better than any other known to this reviewer. Geography and anthropology, his tory and economics, politics and personali ties, art and literature all find a place in the narrative, and Professor Dudley's im pressive achievement is to bring them all together into a coherent whole, in which the strengths and weaknesses, the successes and failures of Roman society at all levels plainly appear. The book is no better for one period than for another, but its greatest contribution may lie in its treatment of the later Roman empire, a confused period of which he succeeds in constructing a very clear and convincing picture. It is highly recommended to either the specialist or the novitiate; each will find it rewarding. Knopf $7.9t The Ancient Greeks, by Chester G. Starr. Professor Starr has essayed, in 111 pages, to accomplish the impossible, and the result is a small book which purports to describe the life of the ancient Greeks, in most of its ramifications, from 7000 B.C. down to the end of the Hellenistic period. The com petence of the author is beyond question, but the soundness of the undertaking is not. The book lacks focus, and serves chiefly as a rather attractive frame in which, on pegs neatly arranged, the well-informed reader will recognize bits of information or areas of knowledge with which he is already familiar, but from which the reader who comes to it cold will derive no very clear impressions. It is surely misleading, on page 130, to find schematic drawings of Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns which con vey no indication of the varying relation ships between their heights and diameters. Stimulating questions are raised, e.g., whether imperialism really is as evil an in stitution as it is often said to be (p. 61), and whether brilliant leaders like Alexander the Great actually do shape history, or merely ride the crest of a wave which was moving in their direction already (p. 165). The trouble is that the text is too thin to provide much basis for judgment Oxford $7.95 Cortés and the Downfall of the Aztec Em pire, by Jon Manchip White. In the days when it was possible to visit Cuba, anyone who went to the little town of Trinidad was astonished at the small scale of the few remaining buildings which Cortes and his men used before they set out for Mexico. Their very insignificance is an index to the resolution of the little band which sailed for almost unknown dan gers and, hopefully, unknown riches. Or, the misery of their small buildings may have been the propelling agent in their quest. No matter. The history of so unlikely a mission is endlessly engrossing. In Mr. White's version both author and reader are caught up in the narrative as though it had never been told before. St. Martin's fio The Dragon Wakes: China and the West, 1793-1911, by Christopher Hibbert. This narrative, which recounts the events from Lord Macartney's unsuccessful mis sion to the fall of the Manchu dynasty, takes on freshness by judicious selection from Chinese and English sources. Direct quotations from diaries and letters reveal the temperament and attitudes of British envoys as they confront Chinese resistance to Western demands. As the West gains greater diplomatic and commercial advan tages, China's failure to keep out the foreign ers eventually leads to the end of Manchu rule. Hibbert's brief but balanced account is unfailingly lively and eminently readable. Harper &amp; Row $10 Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Com parative Study of Vietnamese and Chi nese Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century, by Alexander Barton Woodside. Only the ignorant are surprised by the commonplace. Only because of our back cxxvix</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS wardness in Vietnamese studies have we had such trouble understanding how the Viet namese Communists could share so much with their Chinese comrades and yet re main independent. This paradox is best un derstood as the latest manifestation of a millennium-long pattern of historical rela tions between the two countries. Wood side's book is a pioneering work in the field of comparative institutional history. Al though the author exercises restraint in ap plying his findings to the present, lessons are not difficult to find. Vietnamese eager ness to adopt Chinese names and forms with out too much concern for substance may help us to understand the peculiarities of American-inspired "democratic" institutions in South Vietnam. Also instructive is his ob servation that "semi alien or alien trappings and attitudes of the Vietnamese élite" have traditionally stimulated peasant rebellions." His first chapter, an overall comparison of Vietnamese and Chinese cultures, is espe cially recommended both for the scholar and the general reader. Harvard $9.95 The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, by René Grousset. This splendid history of one of the areas which can lay claim to the title of "cradle of civilization" was first published in France in 1939. Now an excellent translation by Naomi Walford brings it to the general reader, who will find in it the best scholarly discussion in any language of Central Asia. Separating legend from fact is never an easy task, and the difficulties are compounded a thousandfold in the case of the nomadic civilizations which flourished on the Mongol and Kirghiz steppes centuries ago. But René Grousset has pieced together the story of Attila the Hun, Jenghiz Khan, Tamerlane, and other great warriors and peoples as no historian before or since. Highly recom mended. Rutgers $17.50 NATIONAL &amp; INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS The Design of Discord: Studies of Anomie, by Elvin H. Powell. Émile Durkheim's concept of anomie serves as a unifying theme in this collec tion of studies of American society. Dürk heim thought of anomie as the sense of loss generated in the disintegrating differentia tions of modern industrial society. This study attempts to carry Durkheim's explo ration of the relationship between anomie and suicide into the broader areas of the city and war. The result is often fascinating reading, especially in the several chapters on crime in the urban setting. Mr. Powell succeeds in making the important argument that violent crime underwent an important transition during the growth of cities. Thus we learn that murder, for instance, has be come an impersonal instrument of organized crime, rather than an individual protest against the cruel publicity of a community. But in the labored chapters on war, the author fails to convince the reader of the relationship between mass society and war fare. Rather his effort reminds us of how little we really know about war as an as pect of twentieth-century society. Oxford $7.50 Out of Place in America: Essays for the End of an Age, by Peter Schräg. A concern for the life of the young unites these superficially disparate pieces. The au thor—himself out of place in America, since he is an émigré German Jew—explores three themes: the dissolution of ethnic cultures, the wasting of the environment, and the shipwreck of American education. Each theme functions as a proxy in understand ing an era in which "the things to which we attached ourselves had the fatal habit of crumbling under our clutches...Thus in the dissolution of ethnic cultures we see the emergence of a generation of working class children who do not dream of their rise in the world. The wasting of the en vironment destroys the connection of the young to nature. And finally, Mr. Schrag's brilliant essays on the failure of American education to establish some grounds for dis ciplined discourse illuminate the future of the young in American society. Nowhere does the author make of adolescence an ideology; rather, his eye is always on the conflicts which mark the end of an era.

FARBER ■ Text by WEN DELL D. GARRETT BARRE PUBLISHERS • SOUTH ST. • BARRE, MASSACHUSETTS 01005 this is a moving and astonishing book, that it will make you cry in places (places like Piqua, Ohio, and Clear Creek Valley, Wyo ming), and that it will be haughtily vilified for being journalistic, impressionistic, and highly selective. No matter; it is true enough. The voices of America to whom the former LB J assistant and Newsday pub lisher listened, in summer 1970, are voices which normally speak only to themselves. They neither listen nor are heard, and in their tense and puzzled isolation is a key to fragmented America. As if the feeling of helplessness, conditioned by mass popula tion, mass production, and mass media, were not itself a sufficient burden, the plain fact is that power blocs in the nation are playing off helpless people against each other. Cor rupt union bosses, callous plutocrats, distant bureaucrats, know-it-all media men—these voices are the ones seldom heard in this book, probably because they are too shrewd to be caught in front of a tape recorder. A certified liberal, Moyers ostensibly is just serving up color slides and documentary transcripts of a troubled nation in the highly successful Studs Terkel manner. But if you look between the lines you notice that he has had the courage deliberately to lay a long fuse that if lighted would bring revo lution—a necessary revolution, one is almost compelled to add. Harper &amp; Row $7.9; Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago, by Mike Royko. Inevitably compared with "The Last Hur rah," this is a book peopled with real life characters who are still living in the munic ipal politics of three decades past. Mayor Daley emerges as a person both fabulous and sickening—as do his associates, his pro grams, and his city. Full of ironical humor, well written, and short (215 pp.), this is nonetheless no book for anyone with a queasy stomach. It has an excellent index for those who seek background on specific individuals and events. Dutton $5.95 Political Action, by Michael Walzer. This short primer of citizen politics arose from Professor Walzer's experiences in the civil rights and anti-war movements, and is designed for those "too often innocent of the complications of political life," with cxxcci</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS sections devoted to beginnings, constitu encies and bases, pressure and electoral poli tics, organization, and other elements of politics. A great deal of this brief book con sists of the elementary terms of political theory and civics, operationally defined but perhaps without full elaboration, and a great deal of it is common sense. It may be said that the guidance here steers one toward a "politics of middle-age," a stable and prudent approach to political action, rather than a new or old radicalism—Walzer seems committed to the system he describes. Quadrangle $5.95; paper $1.9; The Southern Strategy, by Reg Murphy and Hal Gulliver. Two editors of The Atlanta Constitution conclude in this book that the Administra tion's Southern strategy was an outright failure in 1970. "The fact that it did fail may be the most encouraging comment possible on the political health of the South —and of the nation." The book includes chapters on the critical elections in Tennes see, Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia, as well as chapters on school desegregation, black voter registration and election vic tories, and the ubiquitous efforts of George C. Wallace. Loosely organized and no in dex, but wonderful narrative material on how the politicians won and lost. Scribner's $1.95 The Lost Reform: The Campaign for Com pulsory Health Insurance in the United States from 1932 to 1943, by Daniel S. Hirsh field. As Americans have only recently begun to realize, the health of that part of the nation which is poor or aged is not what most boosters thought it was. Indeed, by the standards of most advanced Western industrial nations, it is appalling. This dry, scholarly account of the failure of reform ers to institute a full-scale health insurance system during the New Deal helps us greatly to understand why. The reasons: FDR's reluctance to antagonize further the con servatives; the inability of reformers in and out of government to agree on a unified pro gram; the sapping of all-important middle class support by the development of private programs which serviced the already mod erately well-to-do; and, most critically, the shrewd and effective lobbying of the Amer ican Medical Association and its political action arm. Harvard $8.50 A Percentage of the Take, by Walter Good man. This study of a classic case of big-city corruption furnishes an ironic updating of Lincoln Steffens' "Shame of the Cities" (1904). Steffens wrote about New York when corruption was gross. Goodman de scribes an older city, where the wolves have been killed off but the foxes have increased. The peculations of James Marcus, Water Commissioner in John V. Lindsay's admin istration from 1965 to 1967, serve as the narrative thread to tie together a network of transactions. Through the investigation of Marcus' dealings, Goodman discovers that not a single contractor in New York appears to have turned away from the chance of a fix. What Goodman shows us, then, is a community of small crooks. If things have improved somewhat since Stef fens' account of 1904, where is the consola tion in knowing that, while in Dickensian fashion the knaves and rascals have been exposed and humiliated, men continue to cut corners, slip through loopholes, make killings, and squeeze what they can out of each other? Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $6.95 Military Men, by Ward Just. This fast-paced but episodic account of the "new" American army is journalese at its best. Too thin to be history and too un systematic to be sociology, it is nonethe less a document of considerable authority. Though the widely known chapter on West Point is in some respects the most interest ing (and frightening), those on Fort Hood and Fort Lewis are equally penetrating and considerably more graphic. The author draws no general conclusions, but the men who train, fight, drink, love, gripe, and mark time through these pages do. The pic ture they paint is one of army in deep trou ble over discipline, race relations, the intru sion of changing civilian values, and, above all, an unpopular war. "Yeah, we were on the wrong side," says an ex-sergeant turned colonel. "But we could have won it." The words of a general are more urgent: "I will cxxxii</page><page sequence="22">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS be damned if I will permit the U. S. Army, its institutions, its doctrines, and its tradi tions, to be destroyed just to win this lousy war." Knopf $6.95 American Violence: A Documentary His tory, edited by Richard Hofstadter and Michael Wallace. The forty-page essay that introduces the more than one hundred graphic documents which make up the body of this book is the late Richard Hofstadter's last published work. It is a fitting memorial. Insightful, thoughtful, and urbanely phrased, it is in fused nevertheless with a sense of moral outrage balanced, somewhat, by a strain of hope—hope that Americans may yet face candidly their extraordinary history of vio lence and resort, as they periodically have done, to permanent non-violent reform ac tion. The documents themselves have been judiciously, yet imaginatively, selected by Michael Wallace. They should be read. Knopf $to In the Cage: Eyewitness Accounts of the Freed Negro in Southern Society, 1877 1929, edited by Alton Hornsby, Jr. Mr. Hornsby has searched carefully through both American and European travel accounts to find comments on the rôle of the black in the New South. His volume recovers some of the more interesting fea tures of the black community's experience. The passages which illustrate the com munity's new departure in education, for instance, provide a moving commentary on the emergence of a self-conscious élite. And the section on economic life documents im portant aspects of tenure relationships and entrepreneurial activity. But the volume as a whole lacks a clear focus, so that the significance of many selections is lost among the welter of observations. Quadrangle $7.95 At War with Asia, by Noam Chomsky. Noam Chomsky recently remarked that he would oppose the Indochina war even if the United States could win it.

His theory that economic interests initially prompted American intervention in Southeast Asia is, perhaps, tenuous. Less easily challenged is his well-documented and remarkably dis passionate account of the suffering that our modern military technology has visited upon the inhabitants of that area. "Laos"— a chapter written after the author's visit in the spring of 1970—is the most forceful chapter in the book. It portrays a peaceful people in a lovely land that has now been devastated by the heaviest bombing in the history of warfare. Vast areas have been pulverized. Survivors live in caves or huddle in squalid refugee camps. America's answer to People's War, notes Chomsky, has been to eliminate the people.

On February fourteenth of this year, a statement by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, was printed in the New York Times. It was a statement markedly different from the rantings and roarings emanating from Mos cow, from Peking, from Cairo, from Tel Aviv, and alas, from Washington. Quietly, without bitterness, the Head of the govern ment-in-exile of Tibet spoke for his land and his people—who have suffered more horribly under the Chinese than the Jews ever did under the Nazis. Noel Barber's book is the story of the beginning of this horror. Though the prose is somewhat florid, there is a terrifying sincerity in Mr. Barber's account. So far as confirmation is at all available, the story seems entirely ac curate. Houghton Mifflin $$.9; Interest Groups in Soviet Politics, edited by H. Gordon Skilling and Franklyn Griffiths. In this useful study of Soviet political life, several Canadian and American special ists analyze party officials, secret police, the military leadership, the industrial managers, economists, writers, and jurists. Designed for specialists rather than the casual observer, the study occasionally becomes bogged down in that peculiar jargon beloved by political scientists. On the whole, however, if allowance is made for certain cold-war biases, the book can serve a certain utility. Princeton $12.50 GENERAL Masterpieces of Fifty Centuries. Introduc tion by Kenneth Clark. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has drawn almost entirely from its own collec tions the 402 objects recorded in this cata logue for one of the special exhibitions celebrating its centennial. Each object is illustrated in this splendid book and if one did not see the exhibition a careful reading of the book is the next best way to experi ence these treasures. One may sometimes quarrel with what has been designated a masterpiece—after all, can there be 402 masterpieces in any one institution?—but ap plause is very much in order for the world wide chronological arrangement within con venient time periods. Its clarity and the fresh comparisons it offers are first-rate. Dutton $12.50 Painting, by Peter Owen. There are two major faults with this fifth volume in the Appreciation of Art Series. The first is that there are only two illustra tions in color which, in itself, is one of the major ingredients in painting. The other is the assumption that all readers are educable. Perhaps this attitude is necessary in such a handbook, but there are physical variations in visual perception which may limit or ex pand appreciation. In addition there are infinite variations in the degree of clarity with which painters make their statements, variations which also affect appreciation tremendously or, indeed, govern whether a painting can or should be appreciated at all or not. Mr. Owen's path through the basics of painting, however, is well marked and will undoubtedly answer many questions for those who are coming freshly to the observation of paintings. Oxford $10.75 Romantic England: Writing and Painting, 1711-1851, by Peter Quennell. This splendidly written book carries one through the sweep of English romanticism, that strange, dreamy, strong movement which carried all before it, even the classi cism of the Palladians and the post-Palla dians. The lavish illustrations surprise the eye and please the mind and, for once, those in color do not offend by outrageously dis torting the originals. The text achieves just the right combination of quotation and analysis so that it strengthens rather than interrupts the ambience of the plates. Alto gether the book is a surprisingly sound yet highly sympathetic treatment of an emo tional tradition. Macmillan $11.95 Lincoln and His America, 1809-1865, ar ranged by David Plowden.

This anthology contains a number of well-known essays on the general problem of the existence of other minds. There are the essays by John Wisdom and J. L. Aus tin, and the essay "Persons" by P. F. Straw son. The issue, as the editor points out, "is justifying knowledge claims about the feel ings, intentions, and cognitive style of other minds." There is, he says, no one problem, but "rather a cluster of issues" which can be subsumed under this topic. In this volume, approaches to these problems are divided into arguments about "Analogy," "Behav iorism," "Identity," "Hypothesis," "Crite riological Argument," and "Direct Access." The collection offers a wide-ranging group of essays and those interested in the subject will surely want to have readily accessible Herbert Feigl's "Other Minds and the Ego centric Predicament," H. H. Price's "Our Evidence for the Existence of Other Minds" and Paul Ziff's essay, "About Behaviorism." Illinois $ 11.9s Locke and the Compass of Human Under standing, by John W. Yolton. John W. Yolton's group of essays on Locke's "Essay" are concerned with such topics as "The Science of Nature," "Rela tions in Knowledge and Reality," "Moral Concepts and Moral Principles," and "Signs and Signification," among others. Yolton is less concerned with defending Locke than with explicating his ideas and presenting his arguments amid the intellectual currents of the time. These essays contribute to our knowledge of Locke by correcting miscon ceptions and by providing evidence to sup port new readings. Cambridge $10 Buddhist Ethics, by H. Saddhätissa. Of recent years expositions of Buddhism by Eastern Buddhists have appeared in the West in English. The present book does much to dispel popular misconceptions of Buddhism. In particular, that there is a divi sion in Buddhism of two schools, one which advocates a love for mankind (Mahäyäna), and the other withdrawal from society (Theraväda). For even though the author is a representative of the latter "school," this work shows that the development of mettâ (loving-kindness) is a central feature of all Buddhist thought. Braziller $6.50 Proclus: A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements, translated with Intro duction and Notes by Glenn R. Morrow. Proclus (c.410-484 A.D.), prominent among the Platonists in Athens, was one of the most versatile men of his day. Professor Morrow says of him: "He was indeed the last creative mind in Greek philosophy." Among his surviving works is this "Com mentary on the First Book of Euclid's Ele ments." To the elucidation of Euclid's text there is prefixed a two-part "Prologue," in which Proclus expounds his philosophy of mathematics and their importance in the Platonic system, incidentally telling us much about the history of Greek mathematics. The commentary then takes up Euclid's matter from the Definitions through the Postulates and Axioms to the forty-eight Problems and Theorems which constitute Book I of "The Elements." Professor Mor row's careful, readable translation with its many helpful footnotes will make this work accessible to a wider audience, to those to whom the Greek original would be terra incognita. Princeton $13.50 Hattusha, the Capital of the Hittites, by Kurt Bittel. This series of fine lectures delivered at Bryn Mawr in 1967 adds reliably to our knowledge of the Hittites. An early people, their capital was effectively destroyed by 1200 B.C. and its developments were tenta tive. Archeologically of the utmost impor tance in the human chain of emerging civi lization, their achievements seem somewhat less than those of other peoples whose ef forts had not been so severely cut off. This present account is really an account for the speciahst; but for the specialist it is full of interest. Oxford $10 The Red and the White: Report from a French Village, by Edgar Morin.

He inves tigated it sociologically and found just about what one would expect.

It confirms the vari ety of human responses to given situations, the variety of human levels of existence, and the variety of human solutions to the same problems. Pantheon $7.95 Technology and Humanism: Some Explor atory Essays for Our Times, by William G. Carleton. The essays collected in this handsomely printed volume were written by William G. Carleton during the past twenty-five years and originally appeared in many of this na tion's leading journals of thought and opin ion. Touching on nearly every major social and political issue which has confronted American society since the end of WWII, these essays make fascinating reading. Carle ton has wisely refrained from revising them in light of current developments and, in stead, has chosen to preface each essay with a short note on where his analysis and pre dictions have gone wrong and why. On the more enduring essays, the prefatory note assumes the form of a modest, but well deserved, self-congratulation. In a more general sense, this volume represents the intellectual Odyssey of a gifted postwar American liberal. In his attempt to analyze and understand modern American society, Carleton exhibits all of the liberal intellec tuals' laudable virtues and, alas, many of their weaknesses. When viewed in historical perspective, it is the weaknesses (e.g., the failure to see the contradiction between po litical equality and economic inequality, the uncritical acceptance of pluralist theory, the tacit belief that none of society's ills are logical outgrowths of capitalism, the un wavering faith that solutions to societal problems can only be achieved by Federal intervention) which stand out. If we are to learn from the past, this is as it should be. Vanderbilt $12.50 Political Anthropology, by Georges Balan dier; translated by A. M. Sheridan Smith. C. N. Parkinson once suggested that the study of political systems should be left to anthropologists, and, in keeping with this, M. Balandier, the philosophical anthropol ogist, has generated a concise review of writings on the politics of more exotic so cieties. His analysis of the traditional state is well-drawn though diffuse, and his forma tion of a cogent thesis by and large suc ceeds. In his view, political anthropology continues the modern trend in political analysis away from the "state," and toward the "society," effectively breaking political theory out of a reliance upon historical sequence, utilizing anthropology's breadth and approach to form a discipline based crudely on societal hierarchies and the polit ical constants of more primitive societies. Pantheon $6.95 On Sociology: Pure, Applied, and Empirical, by Ferdinand Toennies; edited by Werner J. Cahnman and Rudolf Heberle. This volume is a welcome addition to Morris Janowitz's series on the Heritage of Sociology. The editors open the collec tion with an adequate introduction to Toennies's life and work, in which they promise a second volume of papers on various aspects of his work together with illustrations of his relationship to Marx, Spencer, Dürkheim, and Weber. Here the editors provide an overview of the sweep of Toennies's work, from the first edition of "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft" (1887) to the mature "Einführung in die Soziologie" ( 1931 ). The first part deals with the forma tion of the ideal-typical constructs—par ticularly with the paired concepts of com munity and association—which formed the leit-motif of Toennies's thinking. After the initial publication of "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft" Toennies spent the next twenty-five years exploring the themes of this classic work, and the second part con sists of four of these papers. Toennies's mature clarification of these issues is sum marized in the third part, largely through translations from his introductory treatise on sociology. The editors close the volume with several selections illustrative of Toen nies's concern with empirical research and applied sociology. Chicago $13.50 cxxxvii</page></plain_text>
