In order to improve this situation, it is necessary to ensure that the means used to restrain occupants work as efficiently as possible, whilst preserving the occupant compartment and thus by eliminating intrusion on the occupant restrained by seat- belts and pretensioners. In frontal collisions where vehicle intrusion is minor, the main lesions caused to occupants are thoracic, mainly rib fractures resulting from the seat-belt. In collisions where intrusion is substantial, the lower members are particularly vulnerable. In the coming years, we will see developments which include more solidly-built cars, as offset crash test procedures are widely used to evaluate the passive safety of production vehicles. If nothing is done in order to limit the restraining forces, occupant lesions will be mainly thoracic, since airbags will have reduced the risk for the head, and lesions of the lower members, linked to intrusion, will be limited. In order to reduce loads on occupants restrained by seat-belts, it has become necessary to work on an optimized limitation of the restraining forces, while taking account of the broadest possible population, especially elderly people. A first step in this reduction was taken in 1995 with the introduction of the first- generation Programmed Restraint System (PRS), with a seat-belt force threshold of 6 kN; thirty seven frontal accident cases involving this type of restraint were investigated. The corresponding data, crash severities and occupant injuries, are reported in this paper. Analysis of these data combined with findings from the University of Heidelberg / NHTSA study, shows that it is necessary to go a step further by reducing the shoulder belt force to 4 kN. As this objective cannot be achieved with a standard restraint system, it was necessary to redesign the airbag and its operating mode, that is, a new seat-belt + airbag combination called PRS II. This paper summarizes the data obtained with the 6 kN load limiter restraint in real-world collisions. A description of the new system is given and its performance in offset crash situation with respect to a European standard belt + air bag system is discussed. The paper provides data on the validation of the PRS II in various frontal collisions and static out-of-position (OOP) tests. INTRODUCTION IMPORTANCE OF FRONTAL COLLISIONS. Detailed analyses of all fatal accident reports in France in 1990 and of the accidentology file of the PSA/Renault Laboratory enabled to determine the distribution of fatalities and seriously injured occupants with respect to collision configurations. The percentages related to frontal impact are respectively 50% and 70%, as shown in Figure 1 ; illustrating the predominant role of this crash configuration on occupant injuries. In order to assess the distribution of lesions in frontal collisions as regards the main body segments, an analysis was conducted on 100 belted front seat occupants taking into consideration serious injuries. Figure 2 presents the distribution of AIS &gt;3 injuries for the head, the thorax, the abdomen and the lower members. It can be observed that the thoracic risk is highest for the passenger, and secondly, for the driver. For the latter, injuries to the lower members constitute the most frequent risk. Since 1992, 3765</page><page sequence="2">improvements have been noted in Europe in cars as regards the resistance of the passenger compartment, especially the reduction in intrusion. In addition the majority of cars are today equipped with belt pretensioners. The combination of these improvements Figure 1 : Predominance of frontal collisions in terms of fatalities and severely injured occupants from LAB PSA/Renault accident database. UD means undetermined cases. Figure 2 : Distribution of severe injuries per body regions for 100 seriously injured occupants ( MAIS &gt; 3) in frontal collisions, occupant belted. Driver and front seat passengers. would suggest a certain benefit in reducing the severity of injuries to the occupant. To assess this hypothesis two accident files, including belted drivers involved in frontal collisions, were selected. The first file (A) comprises 2000 vehicles manufactured before 1991 and with no belt pretensioners in the restraint system. The second file (B) includes 160 vehicles, manufactured since 1992, all equipped with belt pretensioners and structural reinforcements. The two files were compared taking into account the frequency of moderate to serious injuries, AIS &gt; 2 , corresponding to the main body segments, as shown in Table 1. When comparing files A and B, a tendency in the reduction of injury frequency is observed for the head, the abdomen, the lower limbs. For the thoracic segment an opposite trend appears with an increase of risk. As this tendency to reduce intrusion will continue and, as airbags will become more widespread in Europe, one may expect gains as regards the risk of injuries to the head and lower members, and abdominal risks will be maintained. For the thorax, there will be increased risk since rigidifying the structure will result in a direct increase in restraining forces on the occupant. The study presented in this paper was initiated in order to address this rising risk of chest injuries. LIMITATION OF THORACIC RISK LINKED TO SEAT- BELT BELT INDUCED INJURIES AND OCCUPANT AGE - The 3-point seat-belt was designed to protect the occupant as regards contact with the passenger compartment and to avoid his being thrown out of the vehicle. In order to provide this protection, the seat-belt exerts substantial and localized forces on the thoracic cavity. These forces, which may reach 10 kN, generate broken ribs which may or may not be combined with internal lesions of the thorax. The first relationship between seat-belt tension and the associated thoracic risk level was established by J.Y. Forêt Bruno in 1978 (1) based on an analysis of 90 accident cases. The vehicles in question, sold in France in the 1970's, were equipped with 3-point static seat-belts in the front seats with a load limiter located in the belt webbing between the occupant's shoulder and the upper anchorage point. The load limitation was obtained by tearing of the stitching which was used to sew loops in the webbing. In case of impact the stitching tore, thus allowing more webbing from the loop; as a consequence the torso can move relative to the vehicle at a controlled load level. A view of such a load limiter before and after impact is shown in Figure 3a and its force-time response in dynamic test is illustrated in Figure 3b. In 1989, other cases were added to this investigation, bringing the total of this database up to 290 accidents (2). The key point of this unique database is the possibility of showing a relationship between the seat-belt tension exerted on the occupant, his age and the type of resulting lesions; this relationship, reproduced from Foret Bruno study (2), is given in Figure 4. This data clearly shows that thoracic 3766</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 : Risk of AIS &gt; 2 injuries in frontal collisions involving belted drivers.

Figure 3: A load limiter installed in cars sold in France between 1970 and 1977. Real-world Accident with recent - Is this risk still valid with present cars ? To answer this question, at least from qualitative point of view, four examples of recent vehicles involved in frontal crashes have been analyzed. The particularity of these cases is the low intrusion - from 0 to 10 cm - noted opposite the occupant. Another common point: the restraint system comprised of a standard seat-belt with pretensioner. A photographic summary of each accident is presented in the following, including a description of occupant thoracic injuries. Figure 4: Relationship between shoulder belt tension, age of occupant and injury severity to the chest. Reproduced from (2). Case N° 11975 - This involves a crash offset to the left, with a 11 cm dashboard backward displacement. The pretensioners and the airbag functioned properly. The violence of the impact is estimated at 55 km/h in terms of Equivalent Energy Speed (EES). The driver and the front passenger, 55 and 57 years of age, were restrained by seat-belts, they suffered broken ribs and hemothorax (AIS 4). 3767</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5a: Case No. 1 1975 Case N° 11972 -This involves a frontal crash without intrusion on the passenger side, with two occupants restrained by seat-belts in the front seats in the vehicle under consideration. The EES is estimated at 60-65 km/h. The passenger, 54 years of age, without intrusion and airbag, had an AIS 3 at the level of the thorax. Figure 5b: Case No. 11972 Case N° 10851 - In this accident, the vehicle, with a driver 48 years of age, restrained by a seat-belt, struck the side of another vehicle with an EES of 50 km/h. There is a 10-cm dashboard backward displacement. In spite of a seat-belt+airbag combination, the occupant had very serious lesions at the thorax (AIS4), with broken ribs and a hemothorax. Figure 5c: Case No. 10851 Case No. 8894- The vehicle was involved in an offset crash, with an EES of 55 km/h without intrusion on the passenger side. The assessment of chest lesions for this passenger, 53 years of age, is severe as regards the thorax with an AIS level of 4. Figure 5d: Case No. 8894 LIMITATION OF THORACIC RISK LINKED TO SEAT-BELT - The data discussed in the previous sections and these accident cases show the necessity of reducing seat-belt tension forces in frontal crashes. An initial stage, consisting of limiting this force to 6 kN, was carried out in 1995 on Renault vehicles with the introduction of the PRS system (Programmed Restraint System). This system is comprised of a pretensioner pyrotechnic buckle, a retractor webbing clamp and a steel part, fastened between the retractor and the seat- belt anchoring point as shown in Figure 6. This part, designed to deform at a given level of force, acts like a force limiter. Figure 6: The Programmed Restraint System installed in Renault cars since 1995 (6 kN shoulder belt load limiter) The system's operating method includes 3 phases: at the beginning of the impact (15 milliseconds), the buckle pretensioner triggers in order to take up the seat-belt/occupant slack. The occupant's coupling is increased in this phase with the action of the strap blocking mechanism in the retractor (17 ms). This combination enables one to substantially reduce the occupant's initial displacement. In Phase 2, restraining forces are gradually applied. When the seat-belt tension level reaches 6 kN (70 milliseconds), the force-limiter comes into play, authorizing controlled displacement of the retractor in the B-pillar, upwards. Movement of the retractor will enable a displacement of the torso under controlled load, thus allowing the rib cage to be relieved of seat-belt stresses. Complete operation of this device is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: The PRS operating mode - Phase 1 Initial part of the crash and belt pretension activation, Phase 2 Action of the webbing clamp, Phase 3 Load limiter activation, Phase 4 End of impact 3768</page><page sequence="5">Behaviour of the Programmed Restraint System in Real - World Accidents - To date, 41 accident cases related to frontal collisions with cars equipped with this device have been investigated since 1995. Thirty seven cases were selected as the necessary data, i.e. collision information and a detailed medical report on occupant injury, were completed. The main parameters of this sample are summarized in Figures 8a through 8d and detailed findings are presented in Table A1 in the appendix. Age distribution of occupants ranges from 17 years to 72 years, with 1 1 cases (30%) with age &lt; 25 years, 7 cases (19%) with age ranging from 26 to 35 years, 3 cases (8%) between 36 and 45 years, 8 cases (21.5%) between 46 and 55 years, and 8 cases (21.5%) with age &gt; 56 years. The severity of the collisions, expressed in terms of EES, ranges from 35 km/h to 75 km/h. Nearly half of this sample (48.6%) corresponds to a severity which is superior to EES of 55 km/h. Figure 8a : Age distribution in the 37 accident cases with PRS Figure 8b: Collisions' severity in the 37 accident cases with PRS Figure 8c: Maximum thoracic AIS in the 37 accident cases with PRS Figure 8d: Range of overlap in the 37 accident cases with PRS Regarding the injury severity for the thorax, only 2 cases (5.4%) are related to an AIS level of 3. These are cases No. 11419 and No. 12046; in the first case the driver, a 72 old male sustained 3 right rib fractures and lung contusion. The car was involved in an offset collision to the left, with an overlap of 85% and with an EES of 50- 55 km/h. Except fractures to the left metatarsi, no other injuries were found. In the second case two front seat occupant were involved; a 58 years old male in the driver position and a 60 years old female in the passenger position. The driver sustained a fracture to the sternum (AIS 2) and the passenger had 4 left rib fractures (AIS 3). In both accident the shoulder belt load, estimated from the PRS deployment, was 6kN. The other thoracic AIS levels observed for the rest of the sample are AIS 2 with 7 cases (19%), AIS 1 with 13 cases (35%) and AIS 0 with 15 cases (40%). Regarding the overlap distribution among these accident cases, half of the sample corresponds to offset configuration with an overlap below 74% and the other half is close to a full barrier test. An illustration of one accident, case No.12041 in Table A1, is given in Figure 9 with photographs of the car deformation and the PRS deployment. 3769</page><page sequence="6">Figure 9a: Illustration of car deformation in a frontal collision. Case No. 12041 Figure 9b: Illustration of PRS actual deployment in a frontal collision. Case No. 12041 Belt limitation threshold - The accident cases presented in the previous section and the data contained in Table A1 show that a threshold of 6 kN for belt load limitation is not sufficient to prevent a risk of serious injury to the thorax as 2 cases with occupants having sustained an AIS 3 level were found. This observation is consistent with the data from Forêt Bruno (2) published in 1989 . It is therefore necessary to go a step further in the reduction of shoulder belt load. As this reduction will result in an increase in excursions of the head and thorax; it is therefore essential that with this kind of seat- belt, it is necessary to combine the pretensioner and, quite obviously, the airbag. The combination of an air bag and a 3-point belt restraint was discussed in various publications among them are the paper from Kompass in 1994 (3), the study of Kallieris et al. in 1995 (4) and Mertz et al. investigation in 1995 (5). According to the data discussed in Kallieris paper (4)and the mathematical simulation investigated by NHTSA (4) for a variety of crash conditions (frontal and rollover), crash severities and occupant sizes (5°, 50° and 95° percentiles) a threshold of 4 kN for the shoulder belt load limitation appears to be suitable for reducing the risk for thoracic injury, without negative consequences on other injury measurements. Therefore, a 4 kN load limitation threshold was chosen for the belt system. Whilst working in the same thorax/steering wheel distance deceleration space for a 50° percentile of approximately 300 to 350 mm - in this case, it is necessary for the airbag to play an important role by taking part of the thoracic restraint. Before pursuing this approach, it is useful to assess the role of the airbag in reducing injuries in the USA and in France. Air baa accident data in the USA and in France - When the FMMVSS 208 was introduced in the USA in the beginning of the 1980's, according to investigations carried out by NHTSA, most people did not use seat- belts. The percentage of people wearing seat-belts at that time was on the order of 15%; this would suggest the necessity of including occupant protection by means of a restraint system independent of the seat-belt. The physics of vehicle impacts, 50 km/h against a rigid barrier, with 50° percentile dummies not restrained by a seat-belt, imposed de facto paddings or knee plates for the protection of the femurs and knees, and the airbag for protection of the upper part of the body. The assessment of such a restraint system combined with the seat-belt is quite positive, with more than 1500 lives saved (6) during the 1990-1996 period. However, cases of fatal accidents have been noted, involving either adults not restrained by seat-belts or else children in rearfacing seats, or even children without any restraint system whatsoever. Based on these unfortunate cases, one can make the following observations: - Incompatibility of a restraint system for children in rearfacing position, with the deployment of the passenger airbag. - The concern of US manufacturers in the 1970's with respect to risks linked to the aggressiveness of an FMVSS 208 airbag, for occupants near the steering wheel or the dashboard are confirmed. - Smaller occupants may suffer serious injuries in crashes with low Delta V, that is 30 km/h. This problem stems mainly from the energy parameters of the airbag dimensioned in order to absorb energy on the order of 3000 J. In comparison, a Eurobag or "facebag" designed to protect the head of a 50° percentile restrained by seat-belts has an energy potential of 200 J. If one wants to design a seat-belt- airbag restraint system which takes account of OOP situations, it is therefore necessary to explore other possibilities. Current situation in France - Out of the total number of automobiles in France - some 25 million - only 2 to 3% of vehicles are equipped with driver airbags. We lack data on airbag efficiency in Europe, since the target survey files remain statistically low in comparison with the USA, only 100 cases have been studied in France by the Laboratoire d'Accidentologie et de Biomécanique Peugeot-Renault; 75 cases involved frontal collisions with belted drivers. 3770</page><page sequence="7">In Figure 10 a risk comparison for the head, with and without airbags, is given. For the 25 to 45 km/h speed range, one notes moderate lesions (11%) for cases with no air bag as opposed to 0% for cases with air bag. For the 46 to 65 km/h speed range, the frequency of AIS &gt; 2 is 40% without air bag and only 14% with air bag. No facial fractures were observed with air bag, whereas half of the sample without air bag represents facial fractures. The tendency of air bag to improve head protection is confirmed. Figure 10: Accident survey with frontal collisions involving occupants with 3 points belt + Air bag restraint system. Frequency of AIS 2+ injuries to the head. All cases with Eurobag type of air bag. SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN OPTIMIZED SEAT- BELT + AIR BAG RESTRAINT SYSTEM - The basic principle is that occupant restraint energy must be managed, whilst complying with human tolerance limits. In this context, the thoracic cavity is more tolerant to distributed pressure (air bag) than to a very localized pressure (belt). With the same stopping distance for the occupant in the vehicle, it is possible for the airbag to take a part of the seat-belt forces. Once the basic elements of the seat-belt, that is, pyrotechnic pretensioner and force-limitation, have been determined, it is now necessary to define the airbag characteristics. The corresponding specification is based on 2 separate parts: to contribute actively to restraining the occupant, and to control the aggressiveness of the deployment of the airbag. This results in the 3 following main functions: The airbag must inflate very early on in the impact and "wait for" the occupant's contact; this is the anticipation function, analogous to the effect of a pretensioner on the PRS seat-belt. Having a law of force which is as constant as possible. This is equivalent to controlling the pressure in the airbag and the force exerted on the occupant. This is similar to the action of the force-limiter in the PRS seat- belt. These two functions result in an increase in the generator power in relation to the Eurobag. In order to control the bag aggressiveness in OOP situations, it is necessary to compensate this through a more elaborate airbag-folding strategy, in order to reduce the punch out transmitted to the occupant. This objective results in a deployment mode distributed in 3 directions: first downwards and sideways and then toward the occupant. Based on these elements, a new airbag has been developed in the frame of the new system called the PRS II. DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRS-II DESCRIPTION AND VALIDATION The system comprises 3 main components, these are the pretensioner, the belt load limiter and the air bag. The pretensioner - This is a device which enables the seat-belt strap to be drawn taut very quickly at the initial moment of impact. For the PRS-II system, and given the experience acquired on Renault vehicles since 1992, a pyrotechnic buckle pretensioner has again been selected, especially for its efficiency with respect to submarining. In 4 milliseconds, it enables to take up the seat-belt slack and secure the occupant to the seat. The seat-belt force-limiter - The force limitation function is located at the core of the retractor with a torsion bar whose plastic deformation comes into play as soon as the seat-belt force at the shoulder reaches 4 kN. For this function an another option is to use the deformable steel plate, as in the PRS-I generation, providing a sufficient space in the B-pillar packaging. The airbag - The airbag is a 60 liters bag with a pressure limitation function and a folding which allows a deployment from top to bottom and to the sides. As opposite to Eurobag, this bag is defined to protect the head and the thorax. There are different ways to control the pressure of the air bag; the system described here refers to a set of vents in a row, contained in a meltable seam. One the air bag is full and the vents closed At a given pressure, the seam tears and the vents open successively. The restraint force acting on the occupant from the air bag is thus controlled. Development of the PRS II - After a computer simulation phase, the opening pressure of the airbag vents has been validated during tests using a free fall pendulum system. At the same time, the seat-belt force limiter was developed. Then, sled tests were conducted in order to fine-tune the system's characteristics. The validation program also included static tests in OOP, according to ISO recommendations (7), and crash tests with vehicles. Figure 11 provides a description of PRS-II components. The operating phases of the system, as obtained in a 50% offset rigid barrier test, are illustrated 3771</page><page sequence="8">in the same figure where the 4 upper sequences indicate the air bag work and the 4 lower sequences relate to the belt actions. Sequence 1 in Figure 11 represents the firing of the belt pretensioner at 12 ms followed by the start of air bag deployment at 15 ms. Note that once the air bag deployment is achieved (sequence 2) , the vents are still closed; the air bag is waiting for the occupant. When the thorax contacts the air bag, in sequence 3, the seam covering the vents starts to tear, thus liberating the first vent. The bag pressure is now under control; in sequence 4 the belt load limiter function starts to work in conjunction with the opening of the remaining vents in the air bag: with this last sequence the thoracic restraint loads are controlled thorough the impact duration. Figure 1 1 : PRS II- Principle of belt load limiter and air bag actions in a frontal test Actual driver motion sequences as obtained in a frontal offset test are provided in Figure A1 in the Appendix. In this test a car of 1200 kg mass, with 2 front seat occupants (Hybrid III 50°percentile), was subjected to a 56 km/h rigid barrier test with 50% overlap. The sequences in Figure A1 refers to the mains events of the crash and in particular to the PRS II work. COMPARAISON OF PRS II WITH A CONVENTIONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM - Various mathematical simulations and sled tests were conducted in order to assess the PRS-II performances in frontal collisions. In addition two crash tests with the same vehicle model ( mass of the vehicle 1200 kg) were performed; the test configuration corresponds to a 50% offset rigid barrier test at 56 km/h. One of the vehicle was equipped with a conventional belt + air bag system; the belt included a pyrotechnic buckle pretensioner and the air bag was of Eurobag type( volume of 45 liters). The other vehicle had the PRS-II system. In the front seats of both vehicles instrumented Hybrid III 50° dummies were installed. The results from both tests are illustrated in Table 2 and time-histories for the head acceleration, the chest acceleration and the shoulder belt load are provided in Figure 12. With the PRS-II the head HIC and 3ms acceleration are reduced, respectively 75% and 55%; the neck shearing force is also reduced respectively 60% for -Fx and 57% for +Fx. The neck extension moment is increased with the PRS II with a maximum of 35 Nm as opposed to 1 1 Nm with the conventional system. The shoulder belt load reduction with the PRS-II is significant -55%, as a direct result of the combined work of the belt and the airbag. The thoracic acceleration is also reduced but the amount of reduction (24%) is smaller than those observed with the other criteria. This last result shows that 1) the occupant stopping distance is the same for the 2 systems we are comparing and 2) the energy distribution on the thorax is spread differently with the PRS-II. Chest injury parameters, such as the chest deflection and the VC, cannot be compared as the data corresponding to the conventional system (with the same vehicle) are not available. The maximum chest deflection and VC with the PRS II are 25 mm and 0.09 m/s. Compared to the conventional system the PRS II allowed an increased x-displacement of the chest (+60mm). Results of PRS-II validation in vehicles tests - Vehicles from the same model whose front seats were equipped with PRS II were tested according to 3 impact configurations : 1. Rigid obstacle, 15° barrier, 50% offset and a speed of 56 km/h according to AMS procedure (8), 2.Deformable barrier at 0°, 40% offset and a speed of 56 km/h. This configuration reproduces the future European regulatory test, ECE 94 (9), 3. Full rigid barrier, wall at 0°, and a speed of 56 km/h. This test is the representation of the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) as used by NHTSA in the USA. The interest of such a test matrix is to combine demanding conditions for the restraint system - the case of the US NCAP test - and for the structure of the vehicle with the other two offset crashes. The first offset test condition allows to assess both the structure of the vehicle and the restraint system. The test according to the procedure defined by the EEVC (ECE 94) is a special case, since this configuration enables to simulate a car to car collision and also to judge the quality of the triggering system for the belt restraint and the airbag restraint, in particular as the first part of the crash is soft compared to the two other test configurations. The results of these tests are documented in Table 3, which includes the resulting accelerations of the head and thorax, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC 36 ms), the upper neck shear force, the upper neck extension moment, and the shoulder belt tension, the chest acceleration, the chest deflection and VC. All the maximum values refer to measurements obtained from Hybrid III 50° percentile dummy, for both the driver and passenger. The PRS-II system behaved well in all 3 configurations, both belt load limiter and air bag pressure limiter worked. The shoulder belt tension was between 3.9 kN and 4.8 kN. The lowest value was recorded for this parameter was obtained in the EEVC test (for he driver) and the highest value in the US NCAP test (for the passenger). This difference is due to the friction in the D-ring. As this friction is directly related to the dummy forward displacement, its effect on the shoulder peak load is more pronounced for the passenger. Chest accelerations were all below 46 G; this result indicates no chest to steering wheel contact. Neither head to steering wheel contact was observed as illustrated by the low values recorded with the HIC 3772</page><page sequence="9">(between 74 and 519) and with the head 3ms acceleration - between 24 G and 53 G. Chest deflections ranges from 15 mm to 40 mm; the lowest value was obtained in the EEVC test for the passenger and the highest in the NCAP test for both the driver and the passenger. VC values were between 0.03 m/s and 0.64 m/s. Both head and chest accelerations and also chest deflections and VC's ensure that the use of belt load limitation, in the test conditions described here, combined with air bag pressure control has no negative effects on injury measures.

The objective is to verify the harmlessness of the new alrbag as far as the neck region is concerned and to acquire biomechanical data In this field. Tests In the same conditions were 3774</page><page sequence="11">performed with the Hybrid III 50° dummy. Only two tests have been conducted so fare with PMHS and the Hybrid III and their preliminary results are reported in this section. Equipment and method - The subject is seated on a standard seat, leaning over the steering wheel. Two occupant positions relative to the steering wheel were used. In the first position (Figure 13a), the forehead rests on the steering wheel rim and the chin is on top of the airbag module. The horizontal distance from the chest to the rim was 35 mm. In the second position, the nose was located on the module and the chest to rim distance was 100 mm, as shown in Figure 13b. Once the subject is in place, the airbag is triggered. The airbag/subject contact is recorded by high speed cameras and a set of measurements. Figure 13a: Occupant relative position to steering wheel in static air bag deployment OOP tests. Position forehead on rim. Figure 13b: Occupant relative position to steering wheel in static air bag deployment OOP tests. Position nose on module. Preparation of subjects - The subjects are fresh cadavers from the Anatomical Donors' service of the Anatomical Laboratory of the Saints-Pères Faculty, Paris V. The vascular system is re-pressurized (bi- carotid injection) and the pulmonary volume is re- established. Instrumentation - The subjects are equipped with a device which measures the linear and angular accelerations of the head, fastened to the occiput. The T4, T12 vertebrae, as well as the sacrum, are connected to accelerometers. Thoracic deflection is measured with a chest band at level T5. Blood and vascular pressures are measured, as is the airbag pressure. For the Hybrid III measurements comprised neck loads, head and thorax acceleration, head and thorax angular velocity, chest deflection (potentiometer measurement). The Hybrid III was equipped with the neck shield. Test results - Table 4 gives a summary of the Hybrid III tests and the autopsy findings from the PMHS tests. For the Hybrid III, neck positive Fx are 0.1 kN and 1.1 kN for the forehead/rim position and nose/module position. Maximum neck extension moment are respectively 40 Nm and 27 Nm and neck tension forces are 1.8 kN and 1.2 kN. All neck measurements are below Injury Assessment reference Values (12). Chest deflections reached values of 18.5 mm and 13 mm. For the PMHS tests one subject was tested in each configuration. No macroscopic lesion was noted during the autopsy, except for a slight bum on the forearm of the first subject (AIS 1). The pressure limiting function in the air bag worked in both tests. Both dummy and PMHS tests are encouraging though not yet conclusive. Further work is needed, in particular with the Hybrid III 5° percentile dummy. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION This study was initiated to address the rising risk of belt induced chest injuries in frontal impact. The starting point was the analysis of 290 frontal accident cases with vehicles that were equipped in France in the 1970's with a belt load limiter in front seats. The load limiter was based on a tear-webbing principle and was located near the upper belt anchorage point. This data base shows that older people (&gt; 50 years) may sustain severe chest injuries. Based on this experience a program was initiated at Renault with a view to reduce the shoulder belt load. In 1995, a belt restraint system called PRS was introduced; its comprises a combination of a pyrotechnic pretensioner located at the buckle, a clamp retractor and a steel part attached to the retractor and to the belt anchorage point. This steel part, designed to deform at a given load, acts as a load limiter. This allowed to control the shoulder belt load at a 6 kN level. Accident cases involving this type of restraint were collected and analyzed; in particular the behavior of the belt load limiter was investigated in relation with occupant injuries. The data from 37 cases with belted front seat occupants, are reported in this paper. Crash severities ranged from 35 km/h to 75 km/h. A significant part of this sample, 27% of occupants with age &gt; 50 years, sustained minor to moderate chest injuries. The combination of belt pretension and a 6 kN belt load limitation appears to 3775</page><page sequence="12">Table 4: Static air bag deployment tests with the PRS-II air bag.

T 1 2 G 9 14 Injuries : none Abrasion to the right arm AIS 1 have benefits in reducing thoracic loads from the belt for this population; the 6 kN level is however not sufficient to cover the whole population. Thus, a further step in reducing the shoulder belt load is necessary. As this reduction will involve increased excursions of the head and the thorax, the belt load limitation has to be combined with an air bag. The combination of an air bag and a 3-point belt restraint was discussed in various publications among them are the paper from Kompass in 1994 (3), the study of Kallieris et al. in 1995 (4) and Mertz et al. investigation in 1995 (5). According to the data discussed in Kallieris paper (4)and the mathematical simulation investigated by NHTSA (4) for a variety of crash conditions (frontal and rollover), crash severities and occupant sizes (5°, 50° and 95° percentiles) a threshold of 4 kN for the shoulder belt load limitation appears to be suitable for reducing the risk for thoracic injury, without negative consequences on other injury measurements. From the experience acquired with the PRS a new approach in the occupant restraint system was developed. The PRS-II combines a pyrotechnic buckle pretensioner with a 4 kN belt load limiter and an air bag specially designed with respect to 2 key factors: a deployment to the sides and from top to bottom in order to reduce the risk in OOP situations and a pressure control which operates when a certain load is applied by the thorax. One the major concern with the belt load limitation was the possibility to increase the injury risk for the head and for the thorax. A comparison of PRS ii with a conventional restraint system was performed, for the driver, on the basis of offset frontal collisions involving the same car model. The data with PRS II show substantial reductions for the head and chest acceleration, HIC values and neck shear forces. Neck extension moment is increased with the PRS II but the value, 35 Nm, remains below the 57 Nm suggested IARV (10). Maximum chest deflection and VC obtained with PRS II were 25 mm and 0.09 m/s. These data were not compared to those of conventional system, as the corresponding data were not available for the same car model. The PRS II was also evaluated in 3 frontal collisions: offset rigid barrier test at 56 km/h, offset deformable barrier test at 56 km/h (EEVC frontal impact test procedure), and in full rigid barrier test at 56 km/h (NHTSA frontal NCAP test). In the test conditions described here, the combination of a 4 kN belt load limitation with the pretensioner and air bag pressure control has no negative effects on injury measures. 3776</page><page sequence="13">A preliminary investigation to evaluate the risk of neck injury with the PRS II air bag was performed, using the Hybrid III 50° percentile dummies and 2 subjects (PMHS). Two occupant/steering wheel positions, i.e. forehead on rim and nose on module, were used. The air bag pressure control worked in all tests. For the Hybrid III all neck loads were below the suggested IARV. For the PMHS, no lesions were found during the autopsy, except for a slight bum on the forearm for one subject (AIS 1). These data appears to be encouraging at this stage; further investigations with the Hybrid 5° percentile and the analysis of the PMHS test data remain to be performed. In addition further analysis of the present and future accident cases with the PRS 6 kN, will allow to establish an injury risk curve for the thorax.
