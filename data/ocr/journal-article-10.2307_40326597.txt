Barbara Breitman Encountering a feminist conception of God can transform a life. In Los Angeles during the 1980s, Joy Krauthammer encountered feminism through the Los Angeles Jewish Feminist Center, with such Jewish Renewal teachers as Savina Teubal and Sue Elwell, and later with Judith Halevy. "Feminism gave me the ability to worship a God who isn't the Lord I can pray to the Source of All Blessings."2 Not long after, she began to attend the Aleph Kallah (the biennial week-long gathering of Renewal Jews) and Elat Chayyim (the Jewish Spiritual Retreat Center), where she learned how to shape her spiritual practice to her new understanding of divinity: I start the morning by greeting the sun. ... I go out in my bare feet and dance in the garden as the sun is coming up, and say the Modah Ani [a prayer said on awakening]. I learned it from Shefa Gold3 at the Kallah in 1993. 1 learned that I could be free and liberated to express myself in ways I didn't know I could.

While she still maintains connections with the Orthodox and Chabad communities, Krauthammer is so identified with the Jewish Renewal move- ment that she introduced herself to me by saying, "I am Renewal!" In addition to her work with women teachers, Krauthammer formed deep connections with male Renewal leaders: Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Shlomo Carlebach, David Zeller, and Stan Levy. 4 How does one speak of (or pray to) "a God who isn't the Lord," in Kraut- hammer's phrase? This article, after giving some background information on "Aleph: The Alliance for Jewish Renewal," will discuss the use of God language in Renewal and explore how it is implicated in the competing ver- sions of feminism expressed and created by women such as Joy. While the theological meanings of God language are important, the focus here will be on its social meanings, that is, on the implications of this mode of construct- ing gender for the lives of women and men in the Jewish Renewal movement. Renewal Jews insist that God cannot be comprehended in human language and must be addressed in multiple images. However, one of the most revolutionary moves they make is their reshaping of the mythological figure of the Shekhi- nah, the feminine divine of Kabbalah. Jewish Renewal's understanding of Shekhinah will be compared to the figure of Shekhinah in classical Kabbalah and to other forms of God language in Renewal. Further, I will argue that the Shekhinah of Jewish Renewal can only be understood if we take into account Renewal's emphasis on artistic avenues for spiritual expression. This article is part of a larger study of the religious world of the Jewish Renewal movement. My primary research methodology is ethnographic, including participant-observation at a variety of events, ranging from syna- gogue services to national conferences, and interviews with Renewal mem- bers and leaders.5 1 have also read a good deal of the literature, both print and electronic, produced by Renewal Jews. Of central importance to the present essay was participant-observation at the sixth annual conference of the Asso- ciation of Rabbis for Jewish Renewal (known as OHaLaH), held in January of 2004. That year, the conference was entitled "Tachat Kanfei Hashechinah! (Under the Wings of the Shechinah)," and it was devoted to an exploration of the feminine divine in Jewish Renewal. Because those who attend this event are the rabbis, and thus the leaders, of the movement, they are in a position to shape the understanding of Shekhinah for others. Both the formal sessions and 54</page><page sequence="3">Meanings ofShekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement informal conversations provided rich material for understanding the meanings of Shekhinah for Renewal Jews. The Origins and Structure ofAleph-The Alliance for Jewish Renewal While many aspects of American Judaism might be characterized as "renewal" in some form, my study is more narrowly focused and confined to organizations and people closely associated with Aleph: The Alliance for Jewish Renewal. I have been studying Aleph since 1999, and I have discussed its characteristics at length elsewhere.6 According to one self-description, Jewish Renewal is rooted in a kind of neo-hasidism, as well as in the counter-culture of the 1960s, the ecological and feminist movements, and "eastern influences."7 Like the Havurah movement,8 another founding influence, Jewish Renewal is one of several alternative forms of Judaism that have flourished over the last thirty years or so, in North America and also in Europe, South America, and Israel. Two rabbis, both originating in Lubavitch Hasidism, can be regarded as the founders of Jewish Renewal: Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and the late Shlomo Carlebach. Carlebach was the inspiration for the founding of the House of Love and Prayer in San Francisco in 1967.9 Many of those associated with the House of Love and Prayer later joined the Aquarian Minyan in Berkeley, inspired by Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, which was founded in 1974.10 Schachter-Shalomi himself had founded the B'nai Or ("Children of Light") Religious Fellowship, a precursor of Aleph, in 1962, and incorporated it in 1978; around 1980, the name was changed to P'nai Or ("Faces of Light") to avoid the apparent sexism of masculine "B'nai" in the earlier title. Aleph, the umbrella organization for the movement, was founded in 1993 out of an amalgamation of P'nai Or and the policy-oriented Shalom Center, founded by Rabbi Arthur Waskow in 1982. Currently, the organization is headed by a paid executive staff of three members: an Executive Director, Debra Kolodny, a Chief Operating Officer, Susan Saxe, and a Director of Spiritual Resources, Rabbi Daniel Siegel; and by a rotating fifteen-member board drawn from active members, with a Chair, Co-Chair, and Secretary /Treasurer, and a legal counsel, Rabbi (and attorney) Stan Levy. The administrative offices are in Philadelphia, but only the Chief Operating Officer actually lives in that city; business is conducted by phone and e-mail.11 There is also a Spiritual Advisory Council consisting of five rabbis and a cantor, all associated with the movement. 55</page><page sequence="4">Chava Weissler Aleph's website describes Jewish Renewal as "a worldwide, trans-denomi- national movement grounded in Judaism's prophetic and mystical traditions."12 Note the term "trans-denominational." Jewish Renewal aspires not to be a new denomination- in addition to the established four: Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative, and Orthodox- but rather to spread spirituality to all of them.13 Sometimes, members refer to Renewal as the "R &amp; D [Research and Devel- opment]" arm of contemporary Judaism. Rabbis ordained in each of the four movements are associated with Jewish Renewal, in addition to some who have completed the Aleph Rabbinical Program or received private ordination. While there are thirty-seven "Aleph- Affiliated Communities" in North America (and eight abroad), affiliation need not be exclusive, but may be combined with affiliation with one of the major denominations.14 Only about two thirds of the individuals who pay dues to Aleph are also members of an Aleph- Affiliated Community; one third are either members of other sorts of congregations or not affiliated with a congregation at all.15 Aleph has a rabbinical ordination program and a rabbinical association, a newsletter and other publications, a biennial week-long gathering called the Kallah, and a number of other pro- grams. No longer formally affiliated, but still closely allied, is Elat Chayyim, a "Jewish Spiritual Retreat Center" in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Several other retreat centers are found in the western and southwestern United States. Characteristics of the Jewish Renewal Movement The Jewish Renewal movement emphasizes spirituality as an approach to Judaism. The quest for an experiential relationship with the divine is abso- lutely central to Jewish Renewal. Aleph sees itself as neo-hasidic, drawing flexibly on traditional- especially hasidic and mystical- Jewish texts and practices, as well as on other spiritual traditions, such as Buddhist meditation and Yoga. Like Hasidism, Renewal emphasizes artistic spiritual expression through music, storytelling, and dance. Charismatic leadership has been cen- tral to the movement, and Schachter-Shalomi has functioned as its "rebbe," or spiritual head. Members recognize the importance of charismatic leadership, that of Schachter-Shalomi and of many other teachers (male and female), in achieving spiritual exaltation; however, there is also some recognition of the dangers of such leadership, and ambivalence about its future role in 56</page><page sequence="5">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement the movement. In addition, Renewal Jews are committed to tikkun ha'olam ("mending the world"), especially by means of ecological, peace, and social justice activism, and what they call tikkun halev ("mending the heart"), which encompasses the values of American psychotherapeutic culture. Finally, Aleph is explicitly feminist and explicitly welcoming to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Jews. The Membership of Aleph While there are no statistics available on the breakdown by age, gender, or economic status of the approximately 3,000 members of Aleph, I gained some impressions in this regard from my participant-observation at numerous Renewal events. In general, two thirds to three quarters of the participants, and about half the leaders, are women.16 The majority of the participants are baby -boomers, but some are in their twenties and others in their seventies and eighties. Singles, couples (both heterosexual and homosexual), and families ("traditional" and "non-traditional") each are an important segment of the membership. Many members of Renewal are married to non- Jews, have a non- Jewish parent, or have other complexities in their religious affiliation. Many people active in Renewal have already been involved in various other alternative spiritualities, from Hare Krishna to Chabad, and some combine Jewish Renewal with Buddhist mindfulness meditation, native American-style shamanism, or other spiritual practices. As already mentioned above, there are those who combine Renewal with other branches of Judaism. For many, the question may be not whether they are Renewal Jews, but what part Jewish Renewal plays in their spiritual economy. As one young woman told me in an interview, she thinks about God from a Reconstructionist perspective, davvens [prays] like a Renewal Jew, "and then there's that little bit of Buddhism."17 A great many of the people and especially of the women most attracted to Renewal are artists: painters, weavers, potters, writers, photographers, musi- cians, dancers. (There are more men among the musicians than in any other artistic field.) Some are professional artists; for others, art is an avocation with an important place in their lives. Another sizeable occupational group, for both women and men, is the "helping professions," primarily psychotherapists, but also physicians, nurses, teachers, massage therapists, chiropractors, and physical and occupational therapists; except for medicine, these are, of course, 57</page><page sequence="6">Chava Weissler professions that are dominated by women. Finally, some people are attracted to Jewish Renewal's left-wing politics; many of these work in or consult for socially conscious non-profit organizations. As may be deduced from this list of professions, the members of Aleph are culturally middle class, but many are hardly well-to-do. A minority of Aleph members work in the corporate world or in other more highly compensated occupations (law, information technology). This essay quotes numerous rabbis. Some members of OHaLaH, the Renewal Rabbinical Association, work full time as congregational rabbis (only a few of the larger Renewal congregations are able to pay a full-time rabbi). Depending, in part, on where they were ordained, they have pulpits in Renewal, Recon- structionist, and Reform congregations, often in small or out-of-the-way com- munities.18 Some rabbis combine congregational work with a variety of other occupations, and many of them have received ordination but work in other ways. They may be certified therapists or spiritual directors, work for Jewish or other non-profit organizations, teach in universities or other schools, act as hospital, geriatric, or military chaplains, run their own non-profit retreat, study, or policy centers, lead retreats or teach courses, give concerts, or sell their art or writing. Indeed, many Renewal rabbis do no paid congregational work but cobble together a living in entrepreneurial fashion. Jewish Renewal and Feminism Since its inception, Aleph-The Alliance for Jewish Renewal has been com- mitted to incorporating the talents, insights, and experiences of women into Jewish life. Two of the eighteen "Statements of Principle" listed on Aleph's website are germane here:19 First, "women and men are full and equal partners in every aspect of our communal Jewish life." This speaks to the acceptance of women as rabbis, teachers, leaders, and members of a minyan. Beyond this, it implies the creation of new ways to fill these roles, informed by women's perspectives and experiences. As one Renewal rabbi remarked to me, "We didn't want to just dress up in suits and go to shul like men."20 Another dis- tinguished between what she called "egalitarianism, in which women get to do what men always did," and "feminism," which is "changing the map."21 Indeed, Renewal is a wellspring of women's energy. It has been character- ized by one leader as "Hasidism meets feminism."22 But Hasidism, like all 58</page><page sequence="7">Meanings ofShekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement "traditional" Judaism, distinguishes sharply between male and female spiri- tuality, roles, and responsibilities. In the twentieth century, Chabad Hasidism, the school in which some of the most influential Renewal leaders were formed, in fact articulated a feminine spiritual role.23 With this background, Renewal feminism is perhaps more likely to understand women and men as essentially different, if spiritually equal. Second, Renewal's feminism cannot be understood simply as endorsing the full participation of women at the practical level; it extends as well to the theological realm: "We intend to open ourselves to the transformation of consciousness and action that is resulting from our living in a time when the Feminine is emerging." If the heart of Jewish Renewal is the search for an experiential connection with the divine, then for Renewal Jews, feminism entails the recognition of the feminine aspect of divinity. Thus, they turn to the figure of Shekhinah, God's immanent Presence, usually symbolized as female in Jewish mysticism. "All of the dimensions of Shechina, [t]he name, the concept, the manifestation of HaShem that is intimate, that is immanent, are core to the theology of Jewish renewal," explains Debra Kolodny, Execu- tive Director of Aleph.24 The kabbalistic myth of the exile of the Shekhinah also speaks to Renewal Jews. For the cosmos to be whole, the Shekhinah, the female aspect of the divine, must be redeemed from exile and reunited with the Holy One, Blessed be He, a masculine aspect of the Godhead. This myth formed part of the original motivation of Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and perhaps of other Renewal leaders from hasidic backgrounds, such as Shlomo Carlebach and David Wolfe-Blank, for inviting women into full participation. They saw the emergence of women's voices as the expression of the divine feminine, and they held that only women could call the Shekhinah home from her exile.25 Yet theirs was not the only view of Shekhinah that came to be expressed in Renewal, nor is Shekhinah the only way that Renewal Jews speak of and to God. One issue that emerges from this identification of women with the feminine divine is that of "essentialist" feminism (sometimes also called "cultural" or "difference" feminism). As theologian Rachel Adler explains, In an early phase of contemporary feminism's development, many femi- nists enthusiastically embraced [the] idea of an essential feminine nature. ... On the basis of women's shared biological characteristics and history of patriarchal oppression, they postulated a universal women's culture whose 59</page><page sequence="8">Chava Weissler common experiences transcended historical context, cultural difference, class and politics. . . . For Jewish women, cultural feminism provided ways to affirm the holiness of bodies that do not have "the covenant sealed in our flesh," bodies that menstruate, bodies that lactate. . . . Cultural feminism offered rich and readily accessible sources for feminine imagery.26 Thus, there is "essentialist," or "complementary" feminism on the one hand, and social constructivist or "egalitarian" feminism on the other. The first position holds that men and women are "essentially" different in important ways. The way to achieve a just society -or to heal Judaism of its sexism- is to revalue the feminine and to incorporate women's nurturing qualities and sensitivities to nature and relationships into a renewed society or a renewed Judaism. The second position holds that, while men and women do differ biologically, most gender roles are social constructions, rather than expressing innate or "essential" qualities of the sexes. According to this view, the way to achieve a just society- or to heal Judaism of its sexism- is to reveal the constructed, rather than natural, character of gender roles, thus freeing women and men to participate on an equal footing, in whatever ways they choose, without prejudging what masculine and feminine spirituality -or other quali- ties-might be. Most Renewal Jews, when asked, say that they fall somewhere in between these two approaches. Adler is critical of essentialist feminism. "What is clear is that, because essentialist imagery reinforces gender stereotypes, it confines rather than throws open the significations of what it means to be a woman." This is true for depictions of women, and also for imagery of the feminine aspects of God. "[Restricting femininity to images of parenting and domestic concern- the nursing mother, the nesting bird, the midwife, the busy hausfrau- limits both God and women," Adler asserts. Most importantly for our topic, she asks: "Is it possible to extricate Shekhinah from the essentialist meanings with which it was endowed in Jewish mysticism?"27 One question we will explore is the degree to which the myth of Shekhinah as adapted by Renewal expresses an essentialist view of women. To further this discussion, we need to look at the kabbalistic myth on which Renewal's version of Shekhinah is based and at other forms of God language in Renewal. 60</page><page sequence="9">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement Shekhinah in Kabbalah In a move that is both subtle and complex, Renewal explicitly recognizes and articulates the importance of the Shekhinah, the feminine divine of clas- sical Jewish mysticism. An important part of the meaning of Shekhinah for people in Jewish Renewal is precisely that the concept comes from Kabbalah. Renewal Jews seek ways to express their spiritual instincts and experiences in Jewish terms, and so they seek resources from within Judaism. Shekhinah is not only "Jewish," but also "mystical," close to Renewal's emphasis on spiritual experience, and to its turn towards "mythical" rather than "cogni- tive" resources from the Jewish past. In order to understand how Renewal has adapted the figure of Shekhinah, we'll look at the classical version of this myth, especially at the notions of gender embedded in the kabbalistic concepts of Shekhinah. The topic of Shekhinah in classical Kabbalah is vast and varied, and only a brief summary can be offered here.28 According to kabbalistic teachings, Divinity is truly infinite and unknowable. This aspect of the Godhead, called Ein Sof (Infinity), manifests and reveals Itself in the ten sefirot, or attributes, known by such names as Wisdom and Understanding, Loving-kindness and Stern Judgment. Two of these are seen in particular as having feminine quali- ties. The tenth and last sefirah, and the one most consistently imaged as femi- nine, is Shekhinah, the divine presence and immanence in the world. Like the moon, but unlike the other sefirot, Shekhinah has no light of her own but receives divine light and abundance from the sefirot about her. She reflects and channels these to the lower worlds. A central myth of the Kabbalah is that the brokenness of this world, the fact that we live with exile, evil, pain, and death, is an expression of the exile or eclipse of Shekhinah, her separation from the rest of the sefirot, and especially from her divine spouse, Tiferet (Beauty), often referred to as Hakadosh Barukh Hu (the Holy One, blessed be He) and identified with the sun. This exile began with the sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden and will end in the messianic era. Another image used by the Kabbalah for the state of Shekhinah is the waxing and waning of the moon, and the very fact that the moon's light is less than and reflected from that of the sun. A midrash teaches that at creation, the moon's light was as bright as the sun's, and in the messianic era, her light will be restored to its primordial brilliance. 61</page><page sequence="10">Chava Weissler In classical Kabbalah, Shekhinah is an ambivalent figure: While in exile, she is in the power of the forces of evil and can be turned to their ends. This speaks to our experience of life as painful and unpredictable. But it also reflects the ambivalence male kabbalists felt about women. Shekhinah in Kabbalah encodes well-known gender stereotypes: The feminine is passive and recep- tive, receiving and transmitting the power of the masculine. Shekhinah can be seen as a beckoning princess or a comforting mother, but also as a stern and punitive disciplinarian. For kabbalists, the myth of Shekhinah's exile is in part about the fate of the people of Israel; for hasidim, it is about the life of the soul; for both, it is about the redemption and healing of the cosmos. Renewal Jews have adapted this myth as a way to frame gender issues. The exile or eclipse of Shekhinah refers to the absence of women's voices and feminine spirituality from Juda- ism,29 while Shekhinah herself symbolizes women's presence and power. While Renewal's Shekhinah differs from the kabbalistic Shekhinah in certain ways, it, too, is founded on gender difference. More than that, as we shall see, Renewal's version of the Shekhinah valorizes certain "feminine" qualities. "Das Ewig-Weibliche zieht uns hinan," intoned Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, speaking at the conference of Jewish Renewal rabbis held in January 2004. He was quoting the ending of Goethe's Faust: "The Eternal Feminine draws us upward." Moreover, he warned, "Don't try to shlep the Shekhinah into the cognitive realm. The word Shekhinah has the same gematria [numerical value] as ha'arafel [the fog]. We must be comfortable in 'endarkenment' as well as in enlightenment."30 Clearly, for Schachter-Shalomi, there is an "eter- nal feminine"; he understands Shekhinah as a mythical figure, expressing a feminine essence that is non-cognitive and mysterious. While not all Renewal Jews share this view, we shall see that some of them understand women as possessing intuitive knowledge and a connection to the natural cycles that are also bound up with their connection to Shekhinah. Shekhinah and God Language in Jewish Renewal Rabbi Geela Rayzel Raphael offered a course on "Feminine God Language" at the Bux-Mont Jewish Community Center outside of Philadelphia. The announcement for the course reads: 62</page><page sequence="11">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement In the last two decades God has been transformed. The King of the Uni- verse has been exploring his feminine side. Come and greet the bride, the Queen and meet the writings of Jewish feminists who have transformed tradition. Raphael, who considers it her mission to bring Jewish Renewal to the women of the suburbs, takes a light-hearted approach here, but the questions she raises are quite serious. In order to understand the meanings of Shekhinah- and her relationship to the King of the Universe- one must consider the range of terms and images for God used in Renewal, and, more specifically, the tension between "mythical" divine images- God with personality, so to speak- and more abstract images that eschew anthropomorphism. Recognizing that all images for God are human and limited, and that the purpose of such images is to enable a connection with the divine, Renewal explicitly encourages the use of multiple names for God. A song by Rabbi Hanna Tiferet, a well-known Renewal leader and recording artist, glorifies the multiplicity of God's names: "When I sing the name of God my spirit rises / from the depths she soars to the light / Shaddai Shekhina Adonai Tzeva'ot I Havaya M'kor Hayyim I Tzur Makom Eyl Elyon I Yah Ruah Elohim."31 Renewal worship puts this multiplicity into practice, as we read, for example, in the introduction to the prayer book used by Kehilla in Berkeley, California: We hope and pray that this siddur might be a vehicle to help you connect the deepest part of your being with the Holy Mystery that we call God. . . . May your experience here this Shabbat morning breathe new life into you, into this kahal, this holy gathering, and into the world. You are encouraged to use the language which is most meaningful to you in addressing the Divine Mystery and Presence. . . . [T]he traditional and unpronounceable name of God . . . has no gender and is a name of Being-Becoming. Adonai, Shechina, and Yah are some of the ways we refer to the Name without pronouncing it.32 Despite this pluralistic approach, some of the "traditional," overwhelmingly masculine ways of imagining God used in the Torah and the traditional prayer- book, the Talmud, and the midrash, seem difficult or offensive to members of Jewish Renewal. Jewish feminist thinkers argue, and Renewal Jews agree, 63</page><page sequence="12">Chava Weissler that God language and social structure are intimately intertwined.33 Powerful, gendered images of God are understood to stand for and support the power of the corresponding gender in humans. God was called "King" in biblical times because kings were the most honored and powerful members of society; "Lord," because lords command; and "Father," because fathers are the heads of the household. Kings, lords, and fathers are men, and so this terminology symbolizes and reinforces the dominance of men over women and conveys the perception that maleness is somehow closer to divinity than femaleness. Both the sexism and the hierarchy embodied in these images go against Renewal's deepest principles. As Rabbi Phyllis Berman told me: "Lord" feels so unfriendly, so external to the self and to the world. And with regard to Melekh ha 'olam (King of the Universe), on the simplest level, as a citizen of a democracy, I have no internal resonance with "King." And also ... it doesn't help any of us to see God as this male figure . . . My sense of God is limited neither by human gender, nor by being so far away from me. I'm no more satisfied by Malkat ha'olam [Queen of the Universe].34 Berman 's remarks express the push that motivates some participants in the Jewish Renewal movement to get beyond anthropomorphic or mythological ways of imagining the divine, and the preference for immanence rather than transcendence in Renewal conceptions of God. Nonetheless, precisely because these masculine, transcendent images for God have been so central to Jewish liturgy in the past, there have been attempts to reinterpret and recuperate them. An effort to grapple with the masculine imagery for God appeared in the program for the 2003 Kallah. Rabbi Ruth Gan Kagan offered a class entitled "King, Warrior, Father, Lover: Reclaiming the Masculine Face of God." Part of the course description reads: In the 80s, spiritual feminism brought to the surface our struggle with hierarchal, patriarchal Judaism; Shechinah was invited back from her exile into the language of our prayers and blessings, and the King was sent to his chambers. All is well. Or is it? To re-explore the masculine face of God, our approach will be deeply personal, blending ancient wisdom with new teachings. . . . Jewish tradition offers a magnificent epic of the holy dance of divine feminine and masculine within each human being. Come wrestle (or maybe dance!) with old ideas and new. 64</page><page sequence="13">Meanings ofShekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement Kagan, in a Jungian move, internalizes the masculine and feminine, point- ing out the balance between the two within individual souls. However, her approach did not seem to resonate with most Renewal Jews; in the end, registration was too low for the course to be offered.35 Another exploration of the possible meanings of "King" and kindred terms has stemmed from study of the symbolism of Hebrew letters. This technique dissolves the literal meaning of the words by looking at the individual letters that make them up. For example, Rabbi Marcia Prager, Rabbi of P'nai Or Religious Fellowships in Philadelphia and Princeton, and Dean of the Aleph Rabbinical Program, reinterprets melekh ("king") as comprising the meanings of its constituent letters: When we bring mem and lamed together with khafv/e can read Melekh in this way: the maternal waters, source of creativity from which all life issues forth (mem), are channeled and guided (lamed), toward the hand/vessel that is open to receive and give (khaj). Melekh takes us from source through channel to ourselves as receivers and givers.36 However, some Renewal Jews find this reinterpretation forced or hard to keep in mind while praying.37 The word Adonai has also received a reinterpretation in Renewal sources, based on the Hebrew word eden (\ih), "doorsill," so that Adonai becomes a doorway rather than a Lord.38 And Marcia Prager correctly points out that Adonai, spelled &gt;hn (as opposed to the Tetragrammaton), is one of the mystical names for the Shekhinah.39 Neither of these attempts to bring back God as Father and Lord has been very successful in Jewish Renewal, and we must ask why. It may be because the bal- ance of power in Judaism is still seen by many Renewal Jews to be very much on the side of men and the masculine. As Arlene Goldbard, then Vice-Chair of the Aleph Board of Directors, put it in a post to the Aleph List-serve: In virtually all davvenen [prayer] and study contexts, I must have my simultaneous gender translator engaged at all times: we can drash [inter- pret] away till the cows come home, but the primary texts are still the pri- mary texts. . . . Believe me, this requires a stretch and that stretch is only slightly ameliorated by having one or two Shekhinah-centered prayers on Shabbos. . . . I'm willing to tote my simultaneous gender translator and make the stretch so far, but if the little we have done toward correcting a 65</page><page sequence="14">Chava Weissler humongous imbalance were truly deemed having strayed too far from the male-centered tradition, having cost men too much, I think my flexibility would soon run out of steam.40 While Goldbard is not referring specifically to recovering male God language here, she makes it clear that the "humongous imbalance" is still a problem in need of correction. Another post to the same list-serve reads: "I have always been drawn to rituals involving the feminine. . . . Sometimes a shift to the other side is needed to correct imbalances of the past to bring them back in to balance. I don't see a move back to center at this time."41 More common than the effort to rehabilitate the masculine mythical images is the use of non-anthropomorphic terms for God. Joy Krauthammer uses the term "Source of All Blessings." Barbara Breitman speaks of God as Being, Life, and "a Process that is larger than ourselves."42 God may be referred to as 'Ein hahayyim (the Source of Life, drawing on the liturgical work of Marcia Falk, who is not, herself, associated with Renewal43), or Ruah ha'olam (the "Life Spirit of the Universe," instead of Melekh ha'olam, King of the Uni- verse). All of these terms express the immanence of the divine presence in the world and eschew both hierarchy and gender imagery. Perhaps the most widely used term is the biblical Yah, a shortened form of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Name of God. Notwithstanding Zalman Schachter-Shalomi's interpretation of Yah as expressing the complementarity of the masculine and the feminine,44 others see it as akin to the Buddhist meditation of following the breath. Some Renewal Jews pronounce Yah in such a way as to recall the "breath of life," by exhaling vigorously as they speak it; Phyllis Berman trans- lated it as "Breathing Spirit of the Universe."45 A prayer such as the Shema, although it is taken directly from a biblical text, may be recited using Yah as the divine name,46 and readers may use Yah as they chant from the Torah. Some Renewal Jews also (erroneously, from the point of view of Hebraic tradition) take this name to be grammatically feminine and use it with feminine-inflected adjectives and verbs. Moving in the direction that also leads to Shekhinah, others create new feminine images for God. This can take the form of a simple, and rather mechanical, substitution of feminine for masculine terms: Imenu Malkatenu (our Mother, our Queen) instead of Avinu Malkenu (our Father, our King), or Berukhah 'at Yah Shekhinah, Elohatenu Ruah ha 'olam (Blessed are you, Yah Shekhinah, our Goddess, Spirit of the world). More creative are two related 66</page><page sequence="15">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement terms incorporating rehem (womb): Rahamema ("Oh Holy Rachamema, Compassionate WombMother"47) and Rahamima ("Compassionate Mother of AH"48). Rahamima may intend to incorporate Rahamim, an alternative name for Tiferei, the (masculine) sixth sefirah, into a feminine form of the divine. Note the importance attached to the Motherhood of God. The feminine divine is identified in these images with the capacity to bear children; birth is a symbol of creation. Such imagery shades over into the way Shekhinah is used by Renewal Jews. What's at Stake: Shekhinah and Gender Politics Marcia Prager states, "In the Renewal Community, the Shekhinah is ascendant. Women's skills are valued, celebrated, and nourished."49 Thus, Prager sees the Shekhinah as connected to women's empowerment. Debra Kolodny points out that "[t]he kavod [honor] given to the Divine feminine has ramifications ... in how we treat one another, in how we pray, in how we respect and honor women and intuition and nurturing, in endless ways that make up a theology that is egalitarian and womanist."50 And according to Geela Rayzel Raphael, Shekhi- nah conveys to women that they are made in God's image, that they are full beings in relationship to divinity. She sees Shekhinah and other female God language as rectifying an imbalance, restoring full spiritual power to women, and raising the consciousness of men. Abigail Weinberg, a woman in her thirties who grew up with both Renewal and Reconstructionism, gave the following analysis: When Zalman [Schachter-Shalomi] brought this all to everybody's atten- tion-the idea . . . that there is a masculine and a feminine in God and in Judaism- which I imagine he got from your basic Kabbalah and Chabad literature- people got it because it really reflects our reality. What that did was, it brought the feminine to be as important as the masculine. In a way, since the masculine had been the only thing that people had seen for a thousand years, we're rushing to catch up with the feminine and blow up the feminine. . . . Men have created the Jewish God, and now women are helping to create God.51 Thus, women- and men- in Renewal understand the attention paid to She- khinah as an expression of the power of women within the movement. Both 67</page><page sequence="16">Chava Weissler women and men function as charismatic leaders and teachers, shaping new forms of Judaism and new ways of thinking about God, and as administrators and managers of Renewal organizations and projects. The original core institu- tions of Renewal (P'nai Or and the Shalom Center), as well as Elat Chayyim, were created by men; more recently, however, women have created retreat centers and other programs. There are distinguishable male and female styles of leadership, especially among those who lead services, teach courses, and create new forms of ritual, artistic, and musical expression.52 A delicate bal- ance, not always articulated fully, reigns between the needs and desires of men and women in the movement. One reflection of the tensions that have emerged in this regard is the constant lament that Renewal is unsuccessful in attracting a sufficient number of men, leaving them a minority of the membership. Another manifestation of these tensions is the perception of Shekhinah in Renewal primarily as a "woman's God." Although Shekhinah is important to Schachter-Shalomi and some other male leaders, 53 my sense is that many of the men in Renewal see Shekhinah as irrelevant to themselves most of the time. For example, one man told me that he was surprised to find himself turning to Shekhinah; the only time this happened was when he was working on some issues to do with his feelings about his deceased mother. It is curious that Shekhinah, as imagined in Renewal, lacks the heterosexual erotic quality that one finds in the classical Kabbalah- the aspects of the hidden, beckon- ing princess, the exiled and longed-for spouse.54 Along the same lines, the Shekhinah of Jewish Renewal tends to lack the "dark side," the harshness, found in kabbalistic sources.55 Renewal's Shekhinah is motherly, not erotic or punitive. Noting the nature of Shekhinah in classical Kabbalah as an "ambiguous male projection of what woman can be," feminist theologian Judith Plaskow remarks that "Shekhinah is a usable image for feminists only if it is partly wrenched free from its original context, so that the tradition becomes a start- ing point for an imaginative process that moves beyond and transforms it."56 This is precisely Renewal's project,57 but its version of Shekhinah nonethe- less reinscribes gender difference. Geela Rayzel Raphael, who teaches about Shekhinah in classes, sings to her in musical compositions, and represents her in fabric art, stresses the difference between "the receptive receptacle of the kabbalists, waiting to be mounted" by the male sefirot, and the "Shekhi- nah Queen Goddess," the trans-valuation of the traditional myth. But while Raphael rejects the passivity of the kabbalistic Shekhinah, she emphatically 68</page><page sequence="17">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement highlights Shekhinah's feminine qualities, describing her as a sympathetic, compassionate earth-mother. She connects this with her understanding of gender difference. Part of her mission, she feels, is "to help Jewish women . . . come to understand the feminine nature of their soul and psyche." 58 Renewal teachers who speak of Shekhinah affirm women's power and the holiness of qualities identified with the feminine. A song entitled "The Ways of a Woman," by Hanna Tiferet, expresses the identification of women and Shekhinah through those characteristics often identified as feminine by "cultural" feminists: The ways of a woman a man cannot know, He does not understand The cycles, the seasons, the ebb and the flow. The prayers of the earth are the secrets women know. We sing the song of Shekhina, bringing us all home, Lifting us on wings of light to a place we've always known. We sing the song of Shekhina, waiting to be heard. The ways of a woman are the ways of life. There's power in our words.59 Note the intertwining of God as Shekhinah with a view of women that con- nects them with natural cycles and the earth. The ways of women are myste- rious to men, according to Hanna Tiferet. The song ends with a warning and an invitation: "Don't stop the women from singing their song. . . . Just sing along." Men should not suppress women's spirituality, but neither are they to be excluded from this women's world. Taking this further, there are those who emphasize that Shekhinah is both important and only part of the picture. "[H]aving a whole relationship with the Divine requires a relationship with the feminine manifestation of the Divine," according to Debra Kolodny. Nonetheless, she also insists that "[a]ll of us [in Jewish Renewal] are attentive to the truth that Hashem [God] is both male and female and neither male nor female." This has both theological and sociological consequences: [A] core theology of Jewish renewal is the obligation to achieve an inter- nal balance of the Divine feminine and masculine. In order for us to live fully into our birthright, b'tzelem Elohim ["in the image of God"], we must 69</page><page sequence="18">Chava Weissler strive for that balance. And, in order for the world to regain its external balance, we must strive to create systems and structures and opportunities that allow people to do this holy work, that honor and support them, that provide role models of integrated people, that affirm and reward success in this realm. . . . Because social constructs, along with expectations, mores, norms . . . often conflict with that obligation, our work is difficult, but it is still mandatory.60 Interestingly, in an interview, Kolodny highlighted gender difference: We have different hormones. Let me tell you, they affect how we behave. ... I say Hallelujah to those differences, because it creates ... a dialectic that allows for some juice. . . . We're going to elevate and fully honor women in our wisdom and our different ways of knowing, and integrate women into what ha[ve] been traditionally male bastions of knowing and learning. I guess I would say that's the project, merging . . . essentialist and social-constructionist feminist theory.61 Like many of those whom I interviewed, Kolodny insisted that she is neither an essentialist nor a social constructionist feminist, but she could see the importance of both approaches. At a plenary session of the conference of Jewish Renewal rabbis in 2004, Rabbi Leah Novick62 presented a view of Shekhinah as the Divine Presence/ Mother who accompanied the Jewish people throughout the ages from biblical times to the present. She spoke of Shekhinah as the feminine Divine Presence who inspired both men and women. Thus, she appears to de-emphasize the special connection between Shekhinah and women, although she partially restored it later in her presentation. In a hand-out, she distinguished the "stages of Shekhinah consciousness," roughly paralleling Jewish history, beginning with the "Great Mother, Earth Mother: in creation of the cosmos and in the birth and renewal of all creatures"; and including, among others, the "Ethical Mother: Teachings of the Talmudic sages"; the "Romantic Mother: . . . Shab- bos Queen, of the Kabbalah . . . Holy apple orchard, Princess, Bride"; and the "Absent Mother" of the rational process, the enlightenment movement. She concluded with the "Goddess Re-awakening: contemporary, feminist, ecologi- cal." These stages of consciousness are a schematic presentation of the insights she conveyed in a poem entitled "Shekhinah," which she also distributed at 70</page><page sequence="19">Meanings ofShekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement the session. While most of the poem speaks of the way Shekhinah inspired the male sages throughout the history of Judaism, the final two verses read: To our diaspora Foremothers, she was the Divine Presence as the Compassionate Source the one they called out to in childbirth, illness and death and celebrated on the New Moon And to us contemporary seekers, she is the Divine Presence In the voices of women, representing the Shekhinah re-awakening Who is calling to us from the earth . . . Save the planet, stop the nuclear madness, clear the air, heal the sick, respect the elders, care for the children63 It is only in these two final verses that Novick locates the Shekhinah in the context of women's lives. Despite her emphasis on Shekhinah as an aspect of God for all of the Jewish people, she seems to affirm the special role of women in calling forth Shekhinah in the present day. Note also the similarity of her language with the terms of ecological feminism. Her vision of Shekhi- nah resembles that of Gaia, Mother Earth; for Novick, Shekhinah calls for ecological activism.64 At one breakout session of the Renewal Rabbinical Association's confer- ence, people spoke of their understandings of Shekhinah. A topic that emerged was how closely Shekhinah should be identified with women. One of the participants said that she wanted to "decouple" Shekhinah from women, while another objected that she very much wanted to keep that connection, especially as she was dealing with infertility issues. Another woman, known for conducting powerful rituals and study sessions, said: "All I am is about Shekhinah. If she doesn't show up, I'm nothing." One of the men present spoke of how he wanted more of the "Shekhinah side" for himself: Instead of the hard driving, busy, competitive male life, he wanted a softer and gentler way to live. Although the participants had different ideas of Shekhinah, they seemed to identify her with characteristics understood culturally (perhaps even stereotypically) as feminine, even if they did not necessarily want to identify her with women. For some men in Renewal, Shekhinah can also express men's disempower- ment. One male in this breakout group- I hesitate to call him a participant- 71</page><page sequence="20">Chava Weissler simply sat silent and looked bored for the whole discussion. He clearly felt compelled to be present and wished he were elsewhere. Near the end of the discussion, another man asked if "the pendulum was still swinging farther, or if it was starting to come back." It turned out that he was tremendously resentful of the Aleph sexual ethics policy that forbids sexual contact between teacher and student, in that he felt it was directed, punitively, at men. He said that when he tried to raise the issue at teachers' meetings, other men literally pulled him back down into his seat and told him that men just couldn't raise this question. Although his remarks seemed "off topic" in a narrow sense, he saw, correctly, that the rise in feminine God language was connected with the rise of female power. Among those I have quoted, there is a range of views on how closely She- khinah is connected with women. For some, the "song of Shekhinah" is the song of women in touch with the cycles of nature and intuitive knowledge. For others, Shekhinah represents the feminine half of an inner psychological balance. For yet others, Shekhinah is a motherly aspect of divinity that inspires both women and men. Nonetheless, all of them agree on two points. First, the very fact that Renewal Jews call upon Shekhinah expresses the empower- ment of women. And second, Shekhinah is tied to those qualities identified as feminine in our culture: soft, warm, motherly, nurturing. None of those quoted appeared to question this construction of the feminine, or to worry that it could reinforce the very stereotyping of women it is meant to counteract. Shekhinah Skeptics Rhonda Shapiro-Rieser, a rabbinical student and spiritual director, heatedly dissented from some views expressed at the 2004 rabbinical conference: "Sometimes we forget that [Shekhinah] is a metaphor. If it's not a metaphor, it's the same problem all over again." Shapiro-Rieser went on to say, "I don't know what 'feminine energy' is. There's been an imbalance [in Judaism], and I'm willing to go along with [correcting the imbalance], but it's a metaphor!" In her view, Shekhinah, "feminine energy," and the "Eternal Feminine" are metaphors whose reification leads to essentialism.65 Feminist theorists have made it clear that mythological feminine figures, if they are thought to express the essential qualities of femaleness, can be politically problematic; they may lead to the same kind of gender stereotypes that were prevalent in patriarchal 72</page><page sequence="21">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement culture, even if the valence seems to be reversed.66 "Essentialist feminism is bullshit," Arlene Goldbard said in an interview. "And I tend to close my eyes to its presence in Renewal."67 Others, while perhaps not conscious of the dilemmas of essentialism, still find Shekhinah problematic in one way or another, though they do not reject the term entirely. Marcia Brooks, who was then Executive Director of Kehilla in Berkeley and is active in many other Renewal groups, told me: I don't like to say "Shekhinah." That's just like leaving Adonai on the other side to me. It's almost this goddess thing, which is not interesting to me, although there are some prayers where Shekhinah fits very well. I espe- cially love using feminist language, feminine God language and feminine power relationship to God language in the Torah service, because the Torah has always been a Tree of Life, and she has always been held near, and . . . I love saying the blessings in the feminine.68 In most contexts, Brooks is not interested in any sort of goddess figure, nor does she want either a feminine or a masculine divinity. Nonetheless, she finds certain liturgical contexts appropriate for feminine imagery. When I asked Phyllis Berman about Shekhinah, there was a long pause. Then she said that she doesn't feel drawn to the term Shekhinah. "It sets up in my mind a duality about God: Adonai feels masculine and Shekhinah feels feminine. And I want unification." Here Berman is speaking particularly about addressing God in prayer; in other contexts, "Shekhinah" can be a meaningful term to her. She understands "Shekhinah-energy," for example, to express the energetic creativity of Jewish women.69 There are those in Renewal who simply do not find Shekhinah a terribly important figure. When Abigail Weinberg made it clear that she herself prefers non-anthropomorphic images for God, such as "ocean," I asked her specifically about Shekhinah. She responded: [In Renewal] there are so many ways of saying . . . "Adonai" and "God" and "Shekhinah." The Shekhinah: Shabbos, white, embracing. If I want to get into a Shekhinah mood ... I don't use the word a lot, but it's all about a toolbox. Jewish Renewal has just blown that toolbox up so it's much bigger, and you can make a lot more things with it. So if I was leading Friday night services Jewish Renewal-style, I might refer to this idea of 73</page><page sequence="22">Chava Weissler the Shekhinah, of the embracing, soft, warm God. . . . It's not that crucial to me, I guess.70 For Weinberg, Shekhinah does hold "feminine" qualities, appropriate for Friday night, when Jews welcome the Sabbath Queen. But Weinberg is more interested in Renewal's "toolbox," the expanded vocabulary of symbols and rituals that enables one to step out of the box of traditional liturgy. Like Shapiro-Rieser, Weinberg recognizes Shekhinah as a metaphor, one among many. Thus there is, within Renewal, a critique of the myth of Shekhi- nah as expressing essential feminine qualities. In the same conversation at the rabbinical conference, Shapiro-Rieser expressed distress that essentialists are in the majority in Renewal. She objected to the stereotypical warm, nurturing qualities associated with Shekhinah among Renewal Jews. "For me," she said, "the 'feminine' is Xena the warrior princess." Conclusion At the conclusion, let me suggest another way of thinking about these ques- tions. Perhaps the important distinction is less between those who take an essentialist or a social-constructionist position- after all, few members of Renewal are systematic thinkers- and more between those who are mytho- logical or artistic thinkers, and those with a more cognitive style. For example, the sixth annual Jewish Renewal Rabbinical Association meeting was judged a great success by most of those who participated. Some remarked that it was the theme of Shekhinah- and the presence of women, Shekhinah's represen- tatives, on the planning committee- that had created the warm, open, rest- ful atmosphere of the conference. Others said that the atmosphere had been created by excellent programming, careful set-up, and attention to detail. This striking gap between "mythological" and "cognitive" thinkers expresses as well the varied meanings of Shekhinah and other God language in Jewish Renewal. Those for whom Shekhinah is a fully mythic figure, expressing essential qualities of femininity, appear to be in the majority. Even some of those who prefer non-anthropomorphic terms for God may feel that women's biology is crucial for their spirituality. Despite her insistence that God is beyond gender, for example, Phyllis Berman told me that women's capacity to bear children endows their spirituality with distinctive womanly qualities.71 74</page><page sequence="23">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement And some of those for whom Shekhinah resonates as a metaphor are resolutely anti-essentialist.72 Thus, one cannot make a neat equivalence between types of God language and essentialist or social-constructionist views of women. Let me also suggest that we misunderstand the meanings of Shekhinah for Renewal Jews if we fail to attend to the artistic and the experiential dimen- sions. Jewish Renewal attracts a great many people with artistic talent and sensibilities and fosters artistic expression of spirituality.73 The draw of Jewish Renewal for such people is that it is an opening to the imaginal dimension, to creativity, and to the mythic. There is a difference between making an argu- ment and creating a painting, a song, or a ritual. Leah Novick concludes her poem on Shekhinah, discussed above, as follows: And to Her, we respond- we are ready to create a dwelling place for the divine here on earth, to Her we answer in music and meditation, in politics and poetry, in dance and drama, to Her we respond: "Hineynu," yes, we are here! It is through the arts (as well as political activism) that one creates a dwelling place for the Shekhinah. For the artists of Jewish Renewal, Shekhinah is far more than a metaphor. This essay began with the words of Joy Krauthammer, a spiritual seeker who is an artist and a musician. For the past four years, among her other activities, Krauthammer has been the percussionist at Lev Eisha ("Heart of a Woman"), the Los Angeles Women's Minyan, meeting monthly "with about 150 ruach- filled, singing, Miriyahm dancing, praying, learning, sharing women." More- over, as Geela Rayzel Raphael showed me her silk paintings on Shekhinah themes, she talked about how doing art puts her into a meditative state. Dream language is symbols, she told me; soul language is symbols; art is symbols. "When I do the inner work, a feminine figure comes out of my consciousness. . . . Dreams and symbols: the Indwelling, the Inner- that's the Shekhinah." Notes 1 .

Rabbi Shefa Gold, a graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, is a composer, musical performer, retreat leader, and teacher in Renewal circles, and director of C-DEEP, the Center for Devotional Energy and Ecstatic Practice. Shefa Gold's melody for the Modah Ani prayer is found on her audiocassette "Tzuri/My Rock" (B'emet Productions, 1991), where it opens a "morning chanting service." As found in prayer books, the prayer means: "I gratefully acknowledge You, living and enduring King, for mercifully returning my soul to me; great is your faithfulness." In Gold's version, there are some slight but significant changes in wording: from modeh ani (m.) to modah ani (f.), "I acknowledge"; and from Melekh hai vekayyam, "living and enduring King," to mah hai vekayyam, "living and enduring Spirit," translated by Gold on the liner notes as "Spirit lives and endures." The significance of the shift from melekh to ruah will become clear below. 4. Telephone interview with Joy Krauthammer, Los Angeles, January 23, 2003, ampli- fied by e-mail sent January 16, 2005.

Since then, I have attended five weekend retreats at the Jewish Renewal Life Center in Philadelphia, approximately fifteen retreats at Elat Chayyim, the Jewish Spiritual Retreat Center in the Catskills associated with Renewal, one Aleph Kalian (2003), and four conferences (one regional and three national) sponsored in whole or in part by Jewish Renewal organizations on various topics such as Jewish meditation or Jewish education. I have attended services many times at P'nai Or Philadelphia, as well as attending a single Sabbath service each at Makom Ohr Shalom in the Los Angeles area, the Malibu Jewish Center and Synagogue, and Beit Tikkun in San Francisco. I have attended two services at Kehilla in Berkeley, and three at Eitz Or in Seattle. I have conducted approximately forty face-to-face interviews with present and former Renewal Jews, on the east and west coasts, and about five telephone interviews. Sometimes I follow up face-to-face interviews by telephone or e-mail, and sometimes I follow up telephone interviews by e-mail. I use snowballing as my technique for recruiting interviewees. 6.

Telephone conversation with Debra Kolodny, June 9, 2005, and www.aleph.org/ locate.html, accessed June 21, 2005. According to Kolodny, the organizational struc- ture changed, at her initiative, about two years ago. Earlier, there were about fifty congregational members of the "Network of Jewish Renewal Communities," but they did not pay congregational membership dues to Aleph. When congregational affilia- tion began to require paying dues to Aleph ($36 per congregational member), which include members' individual memberships as well as meeting certain organizational and religious criteria, not all of these communities chose to affiliate. There is a slight discrepancy between the number of affiliated congregations listed on the website and that mentioned by Kolodny. I presume that since Kolodny is the Executive Director, her information is more up to date, and so it is her figure that is given in the body of the text. As for geographical spread, California is way ahead of the other states, with ten affiliated communities; other states (Arizona, Colorado, Con- necticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) have only one or two each. There is one community each in Canada, England, the Netherlands, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil, and two in Israel. However, there are a number of other groups in Israel that exhibit features of Jewish Renewal- such as Bayit Hadash, headed by Rabbi Mordecai Gafni- but do not affili- ate with Aleph, although there are personal contacts between members and leaders on both continents (Gafni is on the Spiritual Advisory Council of Aleph). 16.

Wasserfall (ed.), Women and Water: Menstruation in Jewish Life and Law (Hanover- London: University Press of New England, 1999), pp. 101-121. Elliot Wolf son argues that Shekhinah is best understood as covertly male. See, for example, his Circle in the Square (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995). 29. Mordecai Gafni, a leader of Jewish Renewal in Israel, inscribed a copy of one of 79</page><page sequence="28">Chava Weissler his books to me as follows: "To Reb Chavah, a Rebbe and a scholar- a holy voice of the Shechinah in our generation- May G-d bless you to participate fully in the fixing of the moon, behinnat tikkun hanukva, behinnat tikkun hayareah, vekhen yehi ration" He addressed me this way in recognition of my research on the tkhines (women's prayers in Yiddish); note how he subsumes me to the Renewal paradigm. 30. My colleague Norman Girardot points out that "fog" and "dark" are feminine symbols in Taoism. 31. Lyrics to the song "In the Light," by Hanna Tiferei Siegel, on her audiocas- sete album A Voice Calls, c. 1998. The names of God, for which no translation appears on the liner notes, can be translated as: Almighty, Immanent Presence, Lord of Hosts, Being, Source of Life, Rock, Place, Supernal God, Yah, Spirit, God. On the name "Yah," see below in the text. The Reconstructionist movement embraces multiple translations of the Name of God; see the series of prayer books entitled Kol Haneshamah. 32. Kehilla is one of the largest Renewal congregations in North America, with about 400 families. The introduction locates Kehilla within the Renewal movement and defines the movement: Kehilla Community synagogue is part of Jewish Renewal, a world-wide phenom- enon whose influence is reverb [er]ating in all the other heterodox movements of Judaism. Those reverberations are evidenced in several ways: through the reclaim- ing of women's voices and experiences through new liturgy and midrashim- inter- pretations of biblical texts from the perspective of women; through the incorpora- tion of movement, meditation and contemplation in our davenning, or praying; through more con[s]cious efforts toward Tikkun Olam- healing and repair- in our relations with one another, with our communities and with our world. I attended services at Kehilla on March 1 and 8, 2003. In the course of the prayers, members of the congregation could be heard using different terms for God. 33. On these questions see Judith Plaskow, Standing Again at Sinai (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1990), Chapter 4, and Rachel Adler, Engendering Judaism (Phila- delphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1998), Chapter 3. 34.

Prager also points out that Melekh (malkhut) is connected with Shekhinah in kabbalistic terminology. Much of her book is devoted to explicating and interpreting the divine names found in the blessing formulas of Hebrew liturgy. 37. Interview with Rabbi Arthur Waskow, February 17, 2003. 38.

See also the following post, by a man, in the context of the same debate: It has always been my opinion/feeling that for Renewal to do what is really neces- sary, the challenge to parts of the tradition, the "sources" and halachah [Jewish law] must go deeper. . . . The commitment to halachah creates a situation in which men's ownership will always trump truly creative renewal. ... I think renewal must equal revolution!

She has connections with the Havurah movement and is a member of B'not Esh ("Daughters of of Fire"), a Jewish feminist collective that meets once a year to explore theological and liturgical issues. Her work is read widely by those interested in creative and/or feminist Jewish liturgy, including participants in Jewish Renewal. 44. See BT Eruvin 18b, where this two-letter name is considered appropriate for the era after the destruction of the Temple. Zalman Schachter-Shalomi points out that the name expresses sexual complementarity: The Yod stands for the male and the Heh for the female; see Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and Ruth Gan Kagan, Meshal Hakadmoni, unpublished ms. (Hebrew). 45. Cf. Gen. 2:7: "The Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth. He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being" (JPS translation). It was Arthur Waskow who began pronouncing "Yah" with an out-rush of breath; the inspiration came to him in 1982 (e-mail, July 8, 2005). 46. See, for example, the rendition of Shema composed by Shefa Gold, on her audio- cassette Chants Encounter, 1994 (track 5). 47.

Rahamima appears in a brief ritual composed by Hanna Tiferet and Daniel Siegel to bestow the title "Eshet Hazon" (Woman of Vision) on "Julie," March 21, 2003 (unpublished ms.). The ceremony also speaks of Shaddai, Malkat 'olam, Queen of the 81</page><page sequence="30">Chava Weissler Eternal Presence. The very fact that the Eshet Hazon ceremony recognizes a special gift of feminine leadership, also termed "midwife of the soul," shows the way gender distinctions are constructed in Renewal. Hanna Tiferet was herself the first Eshet Hazon, honored as such in a newly created ceremony during a Shavuot celebration of Pacific Northwest havurot in 1982. See Shonna Husband-Hankin, "Eshet Chazon: Woman of Vision," in New Menorah, 4 (April-May 1983), p. 4; and Hanna Tiferet Siegel, "Eshet Hazon: A Woman of Vision," in Elizabeth Resnick Levine (ed.), A Ceremonies Sampler (San Diego: Woman's Institute for Continuing Jewish Educa- tion, 1991), pp. 107-110.

Interview with Abigail Weinberg (above, note 17). 52. 1 hope to deal with this more fully in another article. 53. Elliot Ginsburg (conversation, July 30, 2005) and David Zaslow (conversation, July 31, 2005), both influential Renewal rabbis, told me that Shekhinah is important in their devotional lives. Zaslow also insisted: "Shekhinah consciousness is not just to liberate girls to have a God-image that's female, but to redeem men from historical and biological sexism." On the other hand, when I asked Rabbi Victor Gross what Shekhinah means to men in Jewish Renewal, he replied, "Whatever it was, the women have absconded with it" (conversation, July 31, 2005). 54. 1 have also seen no evidence that Shekhinah has developed any tinge of lesbian erotic devotion in Renewal. 55. When I asked Geela Rayzel Raphael about the dark side of Shekhinah, she men- tioned the Hindu goddess Kali. But she added, "If Shekhinah is standing as a symbol of female empowerment, as the earth-mother, sympathetic, compassionate, you don't want to give her bad press." Interview with Geela Rayzel Raphael, February 27, 2005. However, this is not true of all Renewal Jews. Recall Schachter-Shalomi's mention of "endarkenment." Laura Duhan Kaplan, then a rabbinical student (now a rabbi) and Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, told me over lunch at the conference of her study of a "nasty derash" in the Zohar in which Shekhinah is the withholding mother. In the break-out session described above, Eve Penner Ilsen said that the "dark side of the Shekhinah cannot be done in words," but rather in visions. Interestingly, David Zaslow (above, note 53) describes Shekhinah as "fickle." 56. Plaskow, Standing (above, note 33), p. 140. 57. A male participant in a Jewish Renewal Life Center retreat remarked to me when I pointed out some of the darker qualities of the Shekhinah in Kabbalah, "Aren't we beyond that? Can't we make Shekhinah into what we want?" 82</page><page sequence="31">Meanings of Shekinah in the "Jewish Renewal" Movement 58. Raphael, interview (above, note 54). 59.

This is made more explicit in Leah Novick, "Shekhinah Theology of the Future," www.ohalah.orgJnovick.htm (accessed April 27, 2005): "In the present era Shekhinah is clearly planetary Gaia . . . [who calls for] widespread experience of the holiness in all the earth (Gaia) which would make it impossible to pollute, destroy or to exploit this planet or others." 65.
