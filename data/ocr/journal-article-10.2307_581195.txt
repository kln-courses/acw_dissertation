<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 INTRODUCTION During the past 20 years while I have been absent from academic life, I have found AR an immensely valuable way of keeping in touch with archaeological developments in Greece. This encouraged me as I started compiling my first number of 'A in G'. Having arrived in Athens only in early 1997, and then to face a heavy administrative load, I have not been able to devote myself full time to this work until a late stage. (I am thus all the more impressed by Richard Tomlinson's achieve- ment in producing AR 1994-95 from a starting point in late April). My work has been greatly facilitated by the contri- butions of a number of Members and Students of the School, resident in Greece: Lesley Beaumont (northeast Aegean islands), Michael Boyd (prehistoric to Roman Messenia and Eleia), Jill Carington Smith (prehistoric to Roman northern Greece), Tristan Carter (prehistoric to Roman Cyclades and Samos), Colin Macdonald (prehistoric to Hellenistic Crete), Rebecca Sweetman (Roman and Byzantine Crete), Iphigenia Touravitou (prehistoric to Roman central Greece) and David Turner (Byzantine Greece, except Crete). Penny Wilson- Zarganis compiled the list of new publications, Elena Partida helped with excerpting, particularly from the Ergon of the AS, and Yana Spence and Anne Blackman with translations. I am most grateful to all of them. There is no doubt that compiling 'A in G', if not to be recommended in early summer Athens heat, is an effective crash course on recent developments in Greek archaeology. As usual the report covers mainly work of two different periods: the year covered by the latest Deltion Chronika (vol. 46), in this case 1991; and work of 1996, based on the reports which have been kindly sent to me, and on the Ergon of the AS for 1996. For Macedonia and Thrace, AEMTH is a rich source. For Crete the latest Kritiki Estia (5, for 1994-96) unfortunately appeared too late to be taken into account. Other sources used are referred to under the site. For the Deltion Chronika, references to the current volume are given by page number if possible, and without the volume number; references to earlier volumes include the volume number. Use of press reports has been restricted; a full file of press cuttings is available in the BSA library. I have not been able fully to exploit at the last minute valuable numismatic notes provided by Nicholas Hardwick and Julian Baker; this will be rectified next year. One of my aims this year has been to increase the number of illustrations. Fulfilment of this aim (with the support of the editor of AR, Lyn Rodley, for whose patience I am grateful) has been helped by the fact that this year's AR will contain no other archaeological report, but above all by the positive response of many colleagues in providing photographs and plans, (the detailed acknowledgement will be found at the end of this article). The publication in this volume of AR of an Index for 1986-96 will help the reader to cross check for earlier reports of sites, and has certainly facilitated my task. For an explanation of the types of field work carried out in Greece and their forms of publication, and the other sources of information upon which the compiler of 'Archaeology in Greece' can and must draw, I can do no better than refer the reader to the masterly introduction by Hector Catling to his last contribution (AR 1988-89, 3-8). In size, completeness and attention to detail, this report set a standard for, and a challenge to, to his successors. ARRANGEMENT In the geographical arrangement I have followed the model established by Lisa French (AR 1989-90, 2-4) and have avoided reference to specific Ephorates in section headings, since this can give rise to misinformation and misunderstanding, resulting in occasional (justified) complaint, particularly from Ephorates of Byzantine Archaeology. Both the Ephorates of Prehistoric and Classical Archaeology and the Ephorates of Byzantine Archaeology are based on the nomes but in different groupings: Ephorates of Prehistoric and Classical Archaeology: 1 Athens: acropolis, Greek and Roman Agoras, Theseion, Kea 2 Attica (except for areas covered by 1 &amp; 3), Aigosthena, islands of the Saronic Gulf, Troizen and Kythera. 3 City of Athens, Eleusis, the Megarid, Ag. Theodoroi 4 Argolis, Korinthia 5 Arkadia, Lakonia 6 Achaia, Aitolia-Akarnania, Kephallenia 7 Eleia, Messenia, Zakynthos 8 Kerkyra, Thesprotia 9 Boiotia, Larymna 10 Phokis and Arachova, Distomos, Antikyra 11 Euboea (inc. Skyros), Aulis 12 Ioannina, Preveza, Arta, Leukas 13 Magnesia, Karditsa 14 Phthiotis, Eurytania 15 Larisa, Trikala, Grevena 16 Thessalonike, Kilkis, Chalkidike, Pieria 17 Pella, Kozane, Kastoria, Phlorina, Emathia 18 Kabala, Serres, Drama 19 Rodope, Evros (inc. Samothrake), Xanthe 20 Lesbos (inc. Lemnos), Chios 21 Kyklades (except Kea, Amorgos) &amp; Samos (inc. Ikaria) 22 Dodekanese &amp; Amorgos 23 Herakleion (except Abdos, Krassi, Malia) &amp; the deme of 24 25 Anogeia, the community of Seisarcha and the Idaian Cave Lasithi &amp; Avdos, Krassi, Malia Chania, Rethymnon (except Anogeia, Seisarcha and the Idaian Cave) The thirteen Byzantine Ephorates are also based on the Nomes, but in groupings reflecting the differing number of monuments: 1 Attica, Boiotia, Euboea, Phokis 2 Kyklades (except Amorgos), Samos 3 Lesbos, Chios 4 Dodekanese, Amorgos 5 Argolis, Arkadia, Lakonia, Messenia 6 Korinthia, Achaia, Eleia, Kephallenia, Zakynthos 7 Magnesia, Larisa, Trikala, Karditsa, Eurytania, Phthiotis 8 Ioannina, Preveza, Arta, Kerkyra, Thesprotia, Aitolia- Akarnania 9 Thessalonike (except Nea Mechaniona, Basilika, Epanome), Kilkis, Pieria 10 Chalkidike, Agion Oros, Nea Mechaniona, Basilika, Epanome 11 Pella, Emathia, Kozane, Grevena, Phlorina, Kastoria 12 Kabala, Serres, Drama, Rodope, Xanthe, Evros 13 Herakleion, Lasithi, Rethymnon, Chania There are also Ephorates for Underwater Archaology, for Private Collections and for Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology.</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID BLACKMAN Returning to live in Athens after a long absence, one is struck by many changes. The pace of life has increased; the academic season of archaeological lectures is intense and stimulating, sometimes exhausting. The economic development of the country and the infrastructure projects such as the Athens Metro and new airport, and similar large- and small-scale developments all over the country, provide our colleagues in the Greek Archaeological Service with a permanent challenge. They have to respond with instant 'rescue excavations', leaving them too little time for their administrative responsibilities and almost none to pursue their own archaeological interests and research. We in the Foreign Schools must remember that we are privileged, in that we are normally free from the responsibility of rescue excavations and can pursue research excavations and fieldwork, and be grateful for the courtesy and co-operation we receive from our Greek hosts and colleagues. We must also join them in ensuring that the financial implications of preserving the Greek cultural heritage are recognized by those organisations, public and private, which finance the (proper and necessary) development of the country; it is good to note that, for example, EU funds for Greece can be used for the investigation, preservation and presentation of archaeological sites. Archaeology is a subject of importance and general interest in Greece. This is shown by the considerable press coverage, which delights in dramatic discoveries, personalities and controversies. The discovery of what may be Aristotle's Lykeion was announced in January, and excited enormous attention (see below, 'Athens. The Odos Rigilles site'): even the telephone lines of the Archaeological Service and, indeed, some Foreign Schools were besieged for days. The announce- ment by the new British minister immediately after the election that there was no question of the return of the Parthenon 'marbles' caused a furore in the Greek press (the sensitivity of the matter being perhaps not fully appreciated in London), but there were some dissentient voices. The proposal for a new Acropolis Museum is now being revised and pursued with urgency. Controversy continues on the line of the Metro tunnel under the Kerameikos and on the removal of an EH site at Zagani close to the runway of the new airport. The conflict between development interests and archaeological/environ- mental interests will inevitably continue. Among exhibitions which have attracted much attention I mention only two: the new exhibition on Archanes at the Goulandri Museum of Cycladic Art, which opened in May; and the exhibition of 'Treasures of Mt. Athos' which opened in Thessalonike in late June. We report with sadness the deaths of venerable figures of Greek archaeology: Soterios Dakaris, Jean Pouilloux and Nicholaos Zapheiropoulos and (sadly early) Julia Vokotopoulou. We should also mention that AEMTH 7 is dedicated to the memory of five archaeologists who died in 1994-96. They were Soteres Kissas (August 1994), Maria Siganidou (March 1995), Vangelis Pentazos (July 1995), Julia Vokotopoulou (August 1995) and Thanases Papazotos (November 1996). Corrigenda: Some entries in AR 1995-96, 23-25 give the misleading impression that all the work was carried out by the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. In fact the following excavations were carried out by the 7th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities (Larisa): Phthiotic Thebes (Nea Anchialos): excavation of part of a large secular building on Maltezou and parts of an octagonal bath house on Angelidi; Volos. Palea district: excavations uncovering part of the ECh city walls, extensive sections of a bath complex and a section of the Byz wall; excavations in the area of the church of Agioi Theodoroi; Lamia: excavation in the Kastro; Larisa: excavation of the junction of Mavili and Nirvana. The report on excavation in the Athenian Agora in 1994 (AR 1994-95, 2-3) was incorrectly ascribed to Prof. T.L. Shear, Jr. Our apologies.

In addition there have been a number of interesting articles on sites published in the Sunday weekly edition of H Karc0qJeptv, EcTOd Hgepe;.

ATHENS Acropolis Museum. During the rearrangement of the Museum's storerooms the other half of the base of the dedica- tion of Atarvos was located; it is now restored to its original position and exhibited. Fresh conservation, collation and con- solidation operations and-of utmost importance-new identi- fication of stored artefacts as well as of fragments dispersed on the site made possible supplements to past restorations. The storerooms were enriched with over 150 pieces of sculpture retrieved from the site: from the frieze of the Erechtheion, an LA relief in Pentelic marble, a fragment of a base with a dedi- catory inscription, and a marble stele of the 5th Ct BC with an inscribed decree which had been erased. (ADelt 12-13) The acquisition-and display-of two sculptural items was reported: the lower torso of Kore 669, and a relief from the S slope of the acropolis, connected by G. Despinis with a severe style head in the National Museum. Several conclusive attribu- tions were made and the respective pieces joined: an Archaic horse (1359), an Archaizing Kore, and metopes 20 and 11 from the Parthenon's S side. (ADelt 13-14) The so far unpublished bronze ram of a ship (Museum of Pavlos and Alexandra Kanellopoulou) is now ascribed to a small warship (pristis) and dated to the mid-3rd/mid-2nd Cts BC. The conservation of the colossal statue of a R winged Nike, found in the W courtyard of Hadrian's Library, continued successfully. (ADelt 14-15) Acropolis Studies Centre. The spaces for storage and labora- tory analysis were better equipped. Copies of the pedimental sculptures from the E pediment were constructed in concrete: the inner horses of the chariot of Helios were for the first time reproduced in cast, by means of a flexible matrix into which cement was poured. Similarly, copies were made of 'figure D' or Dionysos from the E pediment, of the outer horses of the chariot of Helios, and of horses '0' and 'PB' from the chariot of Selene. New gypsum copies of these figures were cast to replace the old ones provided by the British Museum; they are now on exhibition in the Centre. Aiming to improve the display of the Parthenon sculptures, the moulding of the seated 'figure U' from the W pediment commenced, while the restora- tion of the Triton supporting one of the horses of Poseidon's chariot is being continued. New moulds of metopes from the Parthenon's S side (which were damaged in the explosion in 1687) have been prepared, and the reproduction of the horizontal geisa underneath the East pediment has already started. (ADelt 16-17) Restoration work on the acropolis. For the sake of the monu- ment's safety, a considerable section of the Parthenon's W frieze (the only part that had been left in situ) was taken down, since the constantly increasing signs of weathering were judged extremely dangerous. Additional operations involved the con- solidation of the bedrock of the hill, the registration of dis- persed finds, the compilation of a photographic archive, the creation of an inventory of inscriptions, the preparation for the restoration of the temple of Athena Nike, and the investigation of biological factors that potentially contributed to the degra- dation of monuments in Pentelic marble. Finally, with regard to statics, provisions for the stability of eroded and fractured walls are being made by the Committee for Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments. (ADelt 23) The reconstruction of the Parthenon's E side, supervised by M. Korres, is now complete. N. Toganides reached the conclu- sion that two fragments from the S kerkis of the E pediment belong together, forming a tympanon-slab. The heavy scaffold- ing that used to obstruct the view of the faqade is now removed. The conservation of the 5th column (counting from the E) of the Parthenon's S peristasis has already commenced. This col- umn had been rotated and shifted during the explosion of 1687, jeopardising the stability of the epistyle. Observations beneath the lowest column-drum showed some alien material wedged in, probably after the explosion and intended to support the col- umn. In an attempt to replace this makeshift filling with a more resilient marble piece, a small fragment was recognized as coming from the Parthenon frieze: on its sculpted surface we see part of a chariot-wheel. Between the 13th and 14th columns of the N pteron, and right by the wall of the cella, the marble floor is disturbed: a Ch vaulted tomb had been inserted within the temple's poros foundations. The roof of the central hall of the Propylaia (unsuccessfully restored in 1917) is being systematically disarticulated. The eroded iron clamps in the anc. coffer-lids are being replaced by titanium ones. (ADelt 23-5) Agora. The work of the ASCS in 1991 (ADelt 46, 28-30) was already reported in AR 1991-92, 5 (T.L. Shear, Jr. and J. McK Camp, II). John McK. Camp, II reports on the 1996 season of excavation: "Excavations in 1994 and 1995 in the Athenian Agora shed light on numerous aspects of Athenian life, including the destruction of the city at the hands of the Persians in 479, the form of the great cult statue of Athena Parthenos which adorned the Parthenon, the composition of the Athenian cav- alry in the 3rd Ct BC and the terracotta figurine industry in early R times. The 1996 season has been no less varied, in terms of both the material recovered and the chronological range represented: an EIA burial, an 8th-Ct well, a glimpse into the politics of Athens at the start of the 5th Ct, further evidence of the Persian destruction, and important evidence for the spread of technology in the HL period. Work was concentrated in two areas: in early levels underneath the W end of the Middle Stoa and in and around the C commercial building N of the Stoa Poikile (Fig. 1: A &amp; B). In both areas our understand- ing of the topography of the agora in various periods has been greatly enhanced. SW area. In the SW area we excavated in the agora square low down within the foundations of the Middle Stoa, a few metres to the E of the boundary stone found in 1967. Here successive layers of deep gravelly fill indicated periods when the floor of the agora was raised significantly. One such period was late in the 5th Ct BC, when the construction of S Stoa I to</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 5 Fig. 1 the SE and the New Bouleuterion to the NW both produced large amounts of quarried bedrock fill. A second major raising of the levels occurred in the third quarter of the 4th Ct BC, when the SW fountain house was constructed at the SW corer of the square. A terracotta pipeline found running in a N direction through the excavations proved to be of considerable interest. A total of 19 sections were found in situ, each segment measuring 0.65m long and 0.15m in diameter. Unusual is the careful sealing of the joints, using bands of molten lead. The thickness of the pipes (0.02m), together with the care with which the joints were sealed, are largely unparalleled among the dozens of pipelines excavated in the agora and indicate that the pipe was built to carry fresh water, under pressure. Pottery from associated levels suggests that this pressure line should be dated no later than the early 3rd Ct BC, making it the earliest known from Athens and among the earliest in the Greek world. For centuries Athenian aqueducts were all gravity-flow, requiring a continuous slight decline from source to terminus. The technology of pressure lines-which led eventually to the great aqueducts of the R world-was apparently developed early in the HL period. The great citadel of Pergamon, capital of the Attalid dynasty, was supplied with pressure lines as early as the 3th Ct BC and it would be a reasonable assumption that the technology was introduced to Athens from Pergamon as the Attalid kings were great admirers and benefactors of the Athenians in the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC. The new pipeline, how- ever, points to another source of inspiration. It is now clear that</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 2 it began at the LC waterclock or klepsydra which lies some 10m to the S. This monumental timepiece, built originally in the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, was extensively remodelled in the early 3rd Ct to reflect advances made in timekeeping tech- nology. The original overflow line, built of reused well-tiles set edge to edge, has been known for years. The newly discovered pipeline-in use after the remodelling-runs parallel to it and apparently carried off the overflow, which will have been good clean water, suitable for re-use elsewhere in the agora. The use of a pressure pipe in this particular system is less surprising and perhaps more significant than were it to be found elsewhere. It is less surprising in that the waterclock represents the absolute cutting edge of hydraulic technology, and a sophisticated new development such as the pressure line might well be expected to make its first appearance in Athens in just such a milieu. The increased significance comes from the fact that the invention of the inflow clock is attributed to Ktesibios, who flourished in Alexandria in the 3rd Ct BC, just the time when the agora clock was remodelled. The new technology, in short, was developed in Ptolemaic Egypt and we must now consider whether the new pressure line was imported with related advances in hydraulics from Alexandria rather than Pergamon. Our new pipeline, despite its modest, utilitarian appearance, may in fact have much to tell us about the spread of technology in the HL Mediterranean. A second, much earlier, hydraulic installation was also uncovered deep under the middle stoa. This was a well driven through bedrock to a depth of 9.25m (30 feet). It was oval, measuring 0.90 by lm, unlined, with footholes cut at intervals on opposite sides all the way down the shaft. The fill consisted of large numbers of rocks, mud, and a few pieces of pottery ('Phaleron cup', SOS amphora, water jar) which allow us to date the abandonment of the well to the years around 700 BC. There was no obvious sign of a period-of-use fill at the very bottom, suggesting that the well saw little, if any, use. The well dates from a time long before the area was given over to public use and presumably reflects the position of a private house now completely gone. Its abandonment close to 700 puts it in a group of 16 other such wells which all go out of use toward the end of the 8th Ct. This simultaneous abandonment of all the wells in use in the area at the same time has led to the hypothesis that Athens and the rest of Greece suffered from the effects of a severe drought in the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC. The great depth of over 9m, as opposed to an average depth of 5.50m for the period, suggests that we have here a serious effort to find water, while the lack of a period-of-use fill perhaps indicates that this extra effort proved futile. The new well would seem to be a welcome addition to the considerable body of evidence which suggests a period of drought and a resultant famine in Athens late in the 8th Ct BC. NW area. Excavations were continued in and around the C commercial building which lies N of the W end of the Painted Stoa. The earliest remains encountered thus far lay deep under the foundations of the Temple of Aphrodite. Here we came upon a simple cist grave cut into the bedrock, oriented E-W, and measuring 1.63m long, 0.35m wide, and 0.35m deep. Within was the extended skeleton of a man, with the head toward the W (Fig. 2). The burial is paralleled by 5 cist graves found under the Royal Stoa and indicates that both banks of the Eridanos river were used as a cemetery in the EIA. East of the commercial building we explored a layer of crushed bedrock fill which produced numerous ostraka, several dozen in all. They almost exclusively carry the name of either Themistokles son of Neokles or Xanthippos son of Arriphron, and would seem to confirm the hypothesis that these two men contended for control of the democratic elements of the city before attention was turned to the aristocratic faction. Xanthippos, the father of Perikles, is known from Aristotle's Constitution of the Athenians to have been ostracized in 484/3 BC, though hitherto his main opponent had not been known. The large number bearing Xanthippos' name (ca 20) suggests that the deposit dates from the very year of his ostracism. Several of the Xanthippos ostraka seem to have been written by the same hand, suggesting the sort of organized political activity which led to the ostracism of Themistokles himself in the late 470s. Found nearby was a shallow pit, 1.10m in diameter and 1.36m deep, containing a small deposit of bg pottery which seems to date to the time of the Persian sack of 479 BC and its immediate aftermath. Made up of a variety of standard house- hold shapes, the group would seem to be domestic in character, with one cup carrying the incised name of the owner, Xenon, on the bottom.</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 3 This pit, together with the well excavated last year, suggests that the area N of the Eridanos was given over largely to private houses in the LA period. Within the C commercial building we exposed more of the walls -some bearing plaster--and several of the anc. floors. In a disturbed area under the floor we recovered an exquisite small head of a youth of the C period (Fig. 3). Most interesting, perhaps, was the recovery of a well-preserved 'pyre', with some 15 vases. The term 'pyre' is something of a misnomer which refers to the remains of some Athenian ritual known only from archaeological excavation. A typical pyre has an area of burning or charcoal and a group of from 3 to 36 pots, with certain shapes commonly represented: a drinking cup, small saucers, a lidded pyxis, and miniature casseroles and cooking pots (chytras). A few bones-sheep or goat or chicken-along with the cooking pots and burning suggest that the pyres reflect some form of ritual dining. Elsewhere in the agora these pyres are commonly found in private houses or shops, often carefully buried under the floor. Five such pyres have now come to light in and around the C commercial building, making this the largest single concentration of pyres among the 36 excavated in the area of the agora. Whatever ritual they reflect, it was practised by the Athenians for a limited time, roughly from 350 to 250 BC. Further to the N, behind the C building, we continued to recover debris from the coroplast's factory, first encountered last season. Dozens of fragments of terracotta figurines and moulds of the late 1st Ct AD were found (Fig. 4), mostly worn and in fragmentary condition, including two incised with the name of the fabricant, Markos. Above the material from the coroplast's factory we found evidence of activity in the 4th and 5th Cts AD, in the form of walls and pottery. A deep pit or well was partially excavated this year and produced large amounts of household material of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct AD: pottery, lamps, coins, glass, and a handsome terracotta figurine of Aphrodite. This group is similar in date and composition to groups of debris (I-J 2-3: 1) found just W of the temple of Aphrodite, apparently reflecting the destruction of Athens by Alaric and his Visigoths in AD 396. Higher up we encountered debris from the devastation of the area at the hands of the Slavs late in the Library of Hadrian. Trial soundings along the W side of the peristyle revealed part of the euthynteria and of the in secondary use. In im- . 4) smediate contact with the stylobate (inside the peristyle) of the stylobate were probably undertaken under Herculius (AD 412). Three consecutive layers of plaster indicated that rooms had been constructed off the peristyle. In some major destruction, these rooms collapsed together with the precinct wall. During the Justinianic period, in the 6th Ct AD, cornices from the monument's faaade were utilized as a coping for the precinct wall. An inscribed base honouring Titus Flavius is worth noting. Further soundings had the purpose of examining structural details of the Library's peristyle, such as the positioning of the toichobate upon small mud-brick arches. A trial trench near the propylon and beside the threshold yielded the lower torso of a large Nike in relief. It is important, however, to remember that the stratigraphic sequence in this area is severely disturbed, due to Ott installations such as the octagonal public cistern situated SW of the Library's facade. Approximately 100 fragments from the peplos and wings of the colossal statue of Nike, which had been incorporated in the W wall of the cistern, were gathered in the R courtyard. Moreover, three segments of a parapet with reliefs on both sides were ascribed to the upper storey of the Stoa of Attalos. As soon as some Ott and later administrative and military buildings were demolished, various sculptural, architectural and epigraphic evidence came to light: half a Cor capital from the Propylon, part of an inscribed list of dedications (on Hymettos marble) probably from the Sanctuary at Brauron (4th Ct BC), an inscribed stone horos, the relief torso of a priestess of Isis, a woman's hand holding a key, etc. (ADelt 17-20) Modern building operations in Plaka were monitored, resulting in the collection of much archaeological material and important observations concerning the topography of anc. Athens. Many sculptural fragments were collected: part of the head of an over-life-size statue (possibly a R copy of the type of Apollo Lykeios), pieces of inscribed marble stelae and slabs with relief decoration, the torso of a HL statuette of Aphrodite. As regards topography, a section of the Med fortification (Rizokastro) was traced (2 Stratonos and 19 Epicharmou). Many anc. pieces were built into it, including a poros block from the staircase of the Theatre of Dionysus. A segment of the LR city-wall was traced at 4 Kyrrestou and Flessa. Its signifi- cance lies in the existence of a tower here (ADelt 22, fig. 3), which was entirely unknown so far. The dismantling of late 7</page><page sequence="8">8 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 5 Fig. 6 walling in this area yielded mainly stone stelae (inscribed, in relief, as grave-markers). A stretch of the anc. road and the base of a choragic monument at 28 Tripodon will be preserved, and (it is planned) put on public display. Discoveries at 18 Diogenous can be connected with the 'Pantheon', which was located by J. Travlos roughly in this locality. Med walls have made great use of anc. material. A remarkable piece of C sculpture comes from this plot: the upper part of a male torso with traces of a shield. At 4 Taxiarchon and Epameinonda survive remains of the W stoa of the peristyle of the R agora. Two construction phases can be distinguished in the stylobate's foundations, as deduced from plasters of different consistency. The deepest foundations are carefully built of poros blocks and quartz mortar set on a layer of stones, instead of the bedrock. By contrast, the upper part is makeshift, employing rubble and lime mortar. H. Robinson was therefore correct in suggesting that a HL peribolos surrounded the area later occupied by the R agora, and was eventually incorporated in this complex. (ADelt 20-23) Parts of the W and SE sections of the 4th Ct BC fortifica- tions of the city of Athens were located at Odos Erysichthonos 13, at Odos Drakou and Mouson and at the junction of Odos Vourvachi 2 and Syngrou. A section of the proteichisma, 1.70m wide, with its ditch, at Odos Erysichthonos 13, preserved three poros and limestone buttresses against its interior face. At Odos Vourvachi 2 and Syngrou the preserved height was 3.40m (6 courses). Nearby was excavated part of a LR cistern and sections of LR buildings. Part of a R-LR cemetery, of undecorated monolithic sarcophagi, was unearthed at Odos Zinne 32 and Androutsou 30, while at a small distance to the S a mud-brick burial complex of the 4th Ct BC was excavated. Between them was found an inscribed funerary stele of the 2nd Ct AD. A section of the peribolos wall of a LR cemetery was excavated at Odos Diamandopoulou 8 and Kokkine, while at Odos Alikarnassou were discovered a poros sarcophagus, part of a funerary stele and a rectangular stone base of a funerary monument, all part of the cemetery extending along the anc. road from the Dipylon to the Academy. Two plastered walls at Odos Diamandopoulou belong to the Hadrianic Gymnasium of Kynosarges, dated by the pottery to the HL and R periods. (ADelt 31-3) Work was begun towards the landscaping of the archaeo- logical park at the Academy of Plato. During the demolition of 70 houses in the area, re-used anc. architectural members (3 marble inscribed funerary columns and 2 marble bases) were discovered, built into the W wall of one of these houses, at Odos Vasilikon 77. (ADelt 33-4) Kerameikos. The Deutsches Archaologische Institut (hereafter DAI) reports: "In 1996 no excavation took place in the Kerameikos. The architects Th. Bilis and M. Magnissalli produced drawings of the views and a plan of the S part of the proteichisma that had not been studied before. Restoration work included that on the pebble mosaic from room VI on the N side of the Pompeion, which has been com- pleted. The mosaic is now on display in the front yard of the museum. The original sculptures of the reclining dog from the peribolos of Lysimachides and of a grave lion from the Street of the Tombs have been put up in front of the mosaic (Fig. 5). The attention and activities of the Kerameikos team were also devoted to the Metro tunnel under the Kerameikos area. During a series of geological drillings by two companies (Metro and the Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration) the ground conditions for the Metro tunnel in the Kerameikos were studied (Fig. 6). The results led to a re-routing of the tunnel: bending now in a slight curve, it avoids the Themistoclean walls (Fig. 7). The monuments along the Street of the Tombs are, however, still in immediate danger of collapsing if a tunnel is built below them at a shallow depth. A series of measuring points has been put along the anc. walls in the Street of the Tombs. Any change in the levels due to the work on the Metro tunnel or to the running of the trains can thus be detected (hopefully early enough to prevent further damage)." The Odos Rigilles site. E. Ligouri (3rd Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities) reports: "Antiquities were found during excavation work on the Odos Rigilles site, which had been granted by the Greek State to the B. &amp; E. Goulandris Foundation for the erection of a Museum of Modem Art; extended excavations followed (May- December 1996), covering about 6 stremmata out of the total area of 11 stremmata. In approximately the S half of the site, the foundations were found of a large building of which three sides (N, E and W) were located, while it extends S beyond the limits of the site towards the Odeion of Athens and near the old bed of the Ilissos. The anc. building (48m wide) had been seriously damaged by the military installations which occupied the area before 1966. The building consists of a rectangular court 23m wide, surrounded by stoas on 3 sides (Fig. 8). The N stoa is 4m wide,</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 7 and the E and W 3.5m. To the E, W and N lie rectangular rooms which correspond with remarkable symmetry. Precisely in the centre of the N side is a rectangular room, with symmetrically laid rooms on either side. A stoa extends along the outer N side of the building. Two hypocausts extend with equal symmetry in the building, one on the NE and the other on the NW side, with corresponding furnace chambers and tanks. In the centre of the N side of the court a cold water tank was found, with semi- circular narrow sides and layers of plaster on the wall. To the S it connects with a sewer, and beyond that with a built conduit whose southward inclination shows that it ran down to drain into the Ilissos. E of the tank is a well with walls covered with clay finger-holds. All the floors of the building which were located were of simple earth. The size of the building, but above all the arrangement of its rooms, show that it has all the characteristic features of a palaestra. If we compare it with the palaestrae of Delphi, Delos, Olympia and (the closest parallel as regards the room arrangement on the N side) the palaestra of the Academy, we observe the following common features: there is a rectan- gular central court which is surrounded by stoas and forms the epicentre of the whole building; symmetry is observed in the surrounding rooms; the central axis of the building is oriented N-S, something observed in most similar buildings; finally, and most important, all the floors are of simple earth. If the identification with a palaestra is accepted we can (on the basis of the analogous buildings and Vitruvius' description) identify the larger central hall on the N side with the ephebeion, the most important exedra of a palaestra, while on the NE and NW must have been the baths (replaced in a later phase by hypocausts). Again according to Vitruvius, the rooms left and right of the ephebeion would have been the elaiothesion, Fig. 8 9</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 9 konisterion and korykeion, but the state of preservation of the rooms and the lack of evidence from the excavations does not ATTIallow their secure identification. After a first study of the sherds and coins from stratified contexts we have established the following concerning the date of the palaestra: (1) it seems to have been founded towards the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC; the existence of a layer with LA pottery shows earlier use of the area; (2) in a second phase, towards the beginning of the 1 st Ct AD (clearly after the Sullan destruction in 86 BC), the superstructure was reconstructed and the two hypocausts added; (3) after the 1st Ct AD the tank must have been built by the well (which must belong to the 4th Ct BC, i.e. phase 1); (4) after the Herulian destruction of 267 AD, and towards the end of the 3rd Ct AD, layers from that destruc- tion were mixed with older floors of simple earth (i.e. the palaestra was functioning again); (5) towards the end of the 4th Ct AD the building was destroyed and not re-used. It is thus certain that the palaestra, which in size and layout of rooms is comparable with the large known palaestrae -those of Delphi, of Olympia and above all of the Academy-must have belonged to a great Gymnasion of Athens. The excavation A Fig. 10 data and the location of the palaestra fully correspond with the written sources and lead us to the conclusion that this was the famous Gymnasion of the Lykeion. The arguments in favour of this view are the following: The large dimensions of the palaestra and the long duration of its use (late 4th Ct BC-late 4th Ct AD) show clearly that it was a public building which after every destruction was repaired and put into use again. The preservation of its original plan throughout its period of use, with repairs and reworking of the original foundations, confirms the evidence of Pausanias that the gymnasion which he saw beside the temple of Apollo was one of the works of the orator Lykourgos. It is in fact E of the city (Strabo, Plutarch, Pausanias), outside the walls (Livy, Plutarch) and beside the Ilissos (Strabo). It is clear from the written sources that the Lykeion was a special extended area E of Athens, which already from the 5th Ct BC performed many functions for the city. This large wooded area must, according to anc. sources, have been limited on the W by the city wall, outside the Gate of Diochares, on the SW by the Olympieion and the other temples along the Ilissos, on the S by the Ilissos and the Panathenaic Stadion, and on the N by Mt. Lykabettos. This very idyllic area, with temples, groves and waters, was a suburb of Athens, exactly like the area of the Academy, bounded on the E by the famous gymnasion. It is known that there were the following prerequisites for the choice of the site for a gymnasion: (a) availability of copious water: the palaestra of Odos Rigilles is indeed precisely beside the Ilissos, and the discovery of two pipes which join into a (HL) water main N of the palaestra and clearly brought pure water from the N (i.e. Lykabettos) reminds us of Strabo's information, that the sources of the Eridanos lay near the Lykeion; (b) the existence of shady trees and groves; (c) a location on the edge of the city, outside the walls in areas where its defence was sensitive, so that the ephebes who trained there would be in a state of readiness at any moment to face an enemy attack. It must be noted here that very near to the palaestra, to the SE, in the bed of the Ilissos, Meliades excavated the known Temple of Herakles Pankrates by the Ilissos. It functioned from the late 4th Ct BC till the mid 3rd Ct AD (PAE 1954), indicating a relationship between the temple and the gymnasion throughout the period when they both functioned." ATTICA Agrileza: J. Ellis Jones and E. Photos-Jones report on recent work: "BSA participation in Laurion researches continues. Earlier work had included excavations, 1977-83 (AR 1984-85, 106-23), study seasons (1980, 1984-86) and scientific researches (BSA 1994, 307-58) and a brief season of air-photography in 1990 (AR 1990-91, 12). More recently, in 1995 joint excavations directed for the 2nd Ephorate of Classical Antiquities by Dr E. Kakavoyiannis and for the BSA by J. Ellis Jones resulted in the complete excavation of Washery A and the hitherto unexplored Washery B (AR 1995-96, 4-5). Washery A exemplified the common Type I of rectangular ore-washery, but Washery B the rarer Type II, with its water-channels and sedimentation basins set outside, and behind its water tank (Fig. 9: general plan of site and all three compounds; Fig. 10: plan of washeries A and B together; Fig. 11: washery B, from the N).

In April 1997, Dr E.

Photos-Jones." Alimos. At Odos Thesmophoreion, on the E slope of the Ag. Anna hill, at the very centre of the anc. Deme of Alimos, a system of walls was excavated, forming a long corridor, a number of rooms, a courtyard and part of a peribolos wall, all dated to the late 5th Ct BC-early 4th Ct BC. On the banks of the stream of Trachones, Rema Trachonon, 250m E of the Ag. Anna hill, a number of walls were discovered, two of which were part of a riverside building, perhaps public, only periodically used. A built well, used up to the 1970s, provided water to the installation. The complex is dated to the late 5th Ct BC-early 4th Ct BC. At Odos Eptanesou, at the S foot of Pani hill, where traces of PR habitation have been located in the past, C remains were excavated, including two marble statues of lions and the comer of a P-shaped poros monument, probably a fountain of the mid 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 62-5) Anabyssos. Rescue excavations at the Agios Georgios site in the settlement of Palaia Phokaia uncovered ECh wall remains, four cist tombs and a well-built double cist tomb (T5 1, T5 2) originally covered with two arched vaults, evidently built to imitate the monumental barrel-vaulted tombs found elsewhere in Attica. T51 included a bronze pin, cauldron and jug, T52 pottery, jewellery and a hoard of 21 bronze coins (assaria) dating from the mid-4th to early 5th Ct. Two of the other tombs also provided jewellery. The building foundations (an irregular rectangle some 6-7m long and 5m wide) appear to be those of a secular structure, dated by coins and pottery to the mid-late 5th Ct. Pottery (amphoras, pithoi, cauldrons, drinking cups, etc.) may indicate that this was a private house. Notable finds include an inscribed bread stamp and a fine terra sigillata plate (39cm diam.) decorated in the centre with a standing figure of Christ giving a blessing and holding a cross-like staff. (ADelt 82-3) Fig. 11 Eleusis. Nine rescue excavations were reported for 1991: at Odos Papagianne the continuation of an anc. terracotta drain- pipe was excavated, parts of which had been located in nearby plots (ADelt 38, 30; ADelt 43, 41. 43). The E section, 10.90m long, was constructed of inverted P-shaped pieces, covered with rectangular slabs, and was lined with waterproof cement at the joins, as were other sections of this drainpipe discovered in the past. The W section, 4.90m long, was of an entirely different construction, consisting of cylindrical pieces bearing a transverse perforation, and also lined with waterproof cement. At Odos Ethnikes Andistaseos 85, 500m from the N foot of the acropolis hill, another part of the anc. cemetery was unearthed, as well as the continuation of a solid retaining wall, both first located in 1989 (ADelt 44, 31-2). A total of 15 burials were identified, arranged in two rows, with an anc. road, 3.50m wide, running between them. Seven out of the 15 burials were cremations, without offerings, while of the rest, two were child pithos burials, two were tile-roofed, hut-shaped, and four were stone larax burials. In one of the latter (Tomb 7) there was evidence of the use of a wooden coffin or bier. A 4th Ct BC date has been reported for most of the burials. At Odos Heroon Polytechneiou (Thevon), 500m to the NW of the archaeological site, part of an anc. road and its two retaining walls was discovered, running E-W; other sections of this road were identified in previous years (ADelt 30, ADelt 45), to the N of the moder road which is on the same axis. The most recent of the three successive road surfaces consisted of a layer of sandy earth and small stones. To the N of the anc. road part of a long EA building was excavated, with an apse to the W, antedating the road; only the limestone foundations and two trodden clay floors were preserved. To the W of the apsidal building part of a cemetery was located, extending along the N side of the road; only two tombs were found intact. To the S of the road was uncovered part of a square building, a basement, with a staircase leading down from the road at its NW corner (9 steps). The alignment of its N side suggests that it was contemporary with the earlier phases of the road. The destruction layer within the building indicates that both it and the road were destroyed suddenly by an overflow- ing river or an earthquake, at the end of the 4th Ct BC or at the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. The finds (ashes, purple shells, melted lead, and an amphora with a red substance) suggest a possible workshop function for the basement. At the junction of Odos Persephones and Chatzidake, an irregular curved cutting contained LG sherds, while at Odos Her6on Polytechneiou 4 were excavated parts of R walls, two R wells, and a complex of seven rectangular rooms of HL date, probably the remains of a private residence (simple construc- tion, everyday household pottery). In the same street (Karatzas plot) a thin Myc layer lies below substantial DA levels (LPG, G) including sections of a wall, three bothroi, and part of a clay floor with traces of a hearth. The next phase dates to the A period and includes part of the stone foundations of a building. To the third phase, of the HL period, belong the substantial foundations of four walls of isodomic masonry, forming two large rectangular areas. In the same context were also reported a well, a drainpipe of the reversed P type, running N-S, and part of a wall dated to the 4th/5th Ct AD. At Odos Nikolaidou 31 and at the junction of this road with B. Laskou, were excavated fragmentary sections of walls and drainpipes of various periods.

The remains of a large Byz church (no date) at the Pegadi tou Tochi site have been cleared and await excavation. Nearby remains of an aqueduct have also been found. (ADelt 81) Laureotike: Keratea. A surface survey of the area, which has been identified with the anc. Deme of Kephale, revealed the position of a large funerary peribolos at the site of Graba, E of the old road from Keratea to Laurion. Other finds include the remains of a rectangular tower, possibly part of a country house, at the site of Sagine, W of the road from Keratea to Kakia Thalassa, and extensive wall remains at the site of Palios Mylos, at the foot of the Routzeri hill. (ADelt 66) Marathon. Sections of retaining walls and parts of anc. roads were excavated at the foot of the Agrieliki hill and at the site of Peliouro-Grava, N of the road to Kato Souli; at the latter, the road was perhaps that mentioned by Strabo, which led to Trikorinthos. (ADelt 69) Megara. In 1991, rescue excavations were conducted at a total of 17 sites in Megara. These produced evidence for a cemetery, parts of buildings, sections of the fortifications of the city, and parts of anc. roads. A section of the main cemetery of the city of Megara, including 30 tombs, was discovered in the Choiromandra area, to the NE of the modem town. Apart from two tombs of the early 7th Ct BC, the rest range from the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC to the MHL period. Most are sarcophagus burials and cist tombs. At the junction of Odos Pangalou and Sophokleous was exca- vated an anc. road, 3.90m wide, lined by eight burials of LG to LA date. The road itself was used from the A down to the EHL period. A small part of the W section of the Long Walls of the city (460 BC) was identified at the junction of Odos Platonos and Loukianou, while parts of the fortification and a retaining wall of the anc. peripheral road were excavated at Odos Aiolou 17. Only the lowest course of the fortification wall was preserved, with a terracotta drainpipe of the cylindrical type running along it. A tunnel with a vaulted roof, running under the road and the fortifications, was probably intended as a secret escape route. Finally, part of the anc. Eutheia Odos, leading to Nisaea, the port of Megara, was located at Odos Minoas 40-2; it was lined with an open drainpipe on the W side. It was used from the 5th Ct BC to HL times. Four examples of 'cellars' were excavated this year, two trapezoidal in plan, like the one discovered in 1989 (ADelt 44), and two rectangular. The two trapezoidal stone buildings (Odos Stilponos 48; Odos Thermopylon 16) preserved remains of a central roof support, the former (5th Ct BC to HL) in the form of a fluted Doric column, the latter (HL) in the form of a stone base, supporting a wooden post. Of the two rectangular buildings at Odos Soteros 26 and Odos Ploutarchou 9 (5th Ct BC-HL), the latter, with a central roof support and a paved floor, is the only example of a 'cellar' with an intact roof. In the same plot was also excavated part of a 5th Ct BC-MHL workshop and a stone well. Part of a R cloth-dyeing workshop with three rooms, five built cisterns and a line of pithoi along one of the walls, was discovered at Odos Koukoule 26. Sections of buildings dating from the 5th Ct BC to the EByz period were excavated at Odos Mantzarou 9, at Odos Metaxa 41 (outside the city walls) and at Odos Demosthenous 26, while a section of a terracotta drainpipe of the inverted P type was located at Odos Grammou. (ADelt 46-57) Menidi. Six burials were excavated at the junction of Odos Heroon Polytechneiou and Napoleondos and in the area of Stravo Schoino. The burials at the former location were all LR cremations, with a few bronze offerings and some pottery. The rest were tile-roofed pit graves. At the junction of Odos Karamanli and Konstantinoupoleos part of a R rural villa was uncovered, including a long main room and a small vestibule. The main room was provided with plastered walls and a paved floor. The building extended to the E. (ADelt 65-6) Oropos. Amphiaraion. B. Petrakos reports in the Ergon of the AS 1996 (24-7) that the small temple was cleared and redrawn. Its prodomos received 4 statue bases in the 3rd Ct BC. The degree of weathering on the paved floor indicates that the building was neither used for long, nor much frequented. Judging also by its dimensions (2.90 x 3.30 m.), the naiskos could actually have been a repository rather than a cult-place. This would explain the Oropians' decision to demolish it and place statue bases on its ruins. However, its size should not be our only criterion in determining its purpose, and the small temple may on balance be correctly regarded as the first temple of Amphiaraos at Oropos. Paiania. Three rescue excavations at the Agios Athanasios site brought to light a large, finely constructed brick and clay storage pithos embedded in the ground (2.04m high, diam. base 67cm, belly 1.20m). This has been dated to the LByz period. Also uncovered were remains of part of a large rectangular structure with a clay tile floor, a cistern and drainage system. Two more pithoi were found here, along with a coin of Manuel I (1143-1180), glazed LByz and postByz sgraffito and painted ware, an intact brown-yellow glazed bowl with a broad rim, part of the support and plate for a lamp, fragments of domestic ware and storage vessels (some with inscribed inside decora- tion), etc. A lower phase revealed ECh pottery and part of a lamp from the same period. The excavators place the main building's first phase in the second half of the 12th Ct, and occupation continued well into Ott times. They suggest this was a settlement that grew up around the nearby church (or monastery) of Agios Athanasios. Another trench in the same site revealed poorly constructed wall fragments, extensive pottery fragments and a 6th-Ct decorated clay bread stamp (ECh to Ott phases, see ADelt 43). (ADelt 83-5) Piraeus Museum. A statue of a standing woman, of the 'Good Luck' type, of white Pentelic marble, a little over life-size, dated to the end of the third quarter of the 4th Ct BC, was found at the municipal rubbish dump at Ano Liosia. Now in Piraeus Museum. (ADelt 58-9) Ramnous. B. Petrakos reports in the Ergon of the AS 1996 (13- 19) on fruitful excavations in the fort: the E gate was flanked by military installations. The N one (two-storeyed) lodged the officer in control of the gate and the fort's security (Fig. 12).

All the burials were oriented E-W and they range in date from PG to EG/MG. Substantial offerings include gold and bronze jewellery, bronze vessels and pottery. (ADelt 71) Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakis Ainian reports on work in 1996: "The anc. city of Oropos lies beneath the modem town of Skala Oropou, on the border between Attica and Boiotia, opposite Eretria. In 1985-87, when Dr B. Petrakos was Ephor of Antiquities of Attica, the late Aliki Dragona excavated the school property (O.Z.K.) at the Western edge of Skala, just outside the limits of the anc. city, and revealed a vast industrial quarter of the EIA. This excavation, which had remained unfinished, was reopened in 1996 by the Greek Archaeological Society. (Ergon of the AS for 1996, 27-38) The excavation was divided into two main sectors (see plans in Ergon 1996). The latest structure in the W sector presumably dates from the LA period. This wall is almost 60m long and the two preserved comers suggest that it was a peribolos enclosing some important public or religious area which extended towards the W. A street of the A period, bordered on either side by a retaining wall, was revealed to a length of 35m. The road was almost 3m wide and followed a N-S direction. Just to the W, a rectangular house was found. It was not entirely preserved but it seems that it consisted of three roughly square rooms opening towards the S onto a court, i.e. the plan is that of an early pastas (10.30 x 9 m). In the SW corer of the E room was a clay bath tub, and in the opposite corer (NE) a hearth. The exact date of construction of the house and the street has not been fixed yet, though they were both certainly in use during the EA and LA period. To the N of the A house the remains of a monumental apsidal structure came to light. It is almost 30m long and oriented roughly N-S. The long wall passes beneath the W retaining wall of the street and is therefore earlier in date. The sherds seem to support a dating in the LG period. It is not clear whether the foundation belongs to a roofed building, in which case one would be tempted to identify it with an apsidal hekatompedon. However, the failure to reveal the W side of the building, as well as the absence of votives, should incite caution. It is equally possible to identify the structure as a peribolos or retaining wall. In the E quarter an extensive industrial quarter of the EIA was excavated (School Buildings I and IV). Buildings of all types, representing no less than five phases, were identified. The majority were built during the LG period and were abandoned well into the 7th Ct BC. Most of the buildings are oriented N-S (A, B-F, 0, I, IA) and the entrance is as a rule located to the S, though the circular buildings (ZT, H) open towards the W and some of the curvilinear buildings of the first building phase follow an E-W direction (E, IB and perhaps A). The walls consist of a stone socle and a mud-brick superstruc- ture. The building technique is impressive, especially from the early 7th Ct BC onwards, when dressed masonry replaces the earlier more careless construction. The lower part of the stone socle was invisible, i.e. it represents a foundation beneath the floor. The entrance of most buildings was provided, usually at a later stage, with a high stone threshold. This was due to the rising of the floor deposits inside, as well as the need to protect the buildings from the overflows of the neighbouring river or torrent. It seems that the floods were becoming more and more destructive during the 7th Ct BC and finally the site had to be abandoned. A remarkable feature of some of the oval buildings is that they were surrounded by a peristyle of wooden posts. Various peribolos walls separate the area into quarters. Practically everywhere there was evidence for metalworking activities, both inside the buildings and also in the courtyards outside. In the central part of several oval buildings the floor con- sisted of successive and extensive layers of clean ashes. In some of the buildings several small circular pits, some of which contained smithing hearth bottoms, were found. These pits are typical furnaces for iron smithing. However, from the preliminary study of the slags by R. Doonan, it appears that bronze-copper casting also took place here, and there is also possible evidence for lead working. Numerous lumps of slag, as well as iron minerals, fragments of tuyeres and possibly parts of bellow pots, have been found. Burnt olive pips, lumps of unfired clay and burnt clay masses from the superstructure of kilns, a well just in front of building B-F, stone and iron tools, as well as querns and whetstones complete the picture of the metal workshops area. Building A (Fig. 15, foreground) was a horseshoe-shaped structure with a stone threshold (7.00 by 4.60m). Around the building, at regular intervals, seven post holes surrounded by a stone packing were detected. These belong to a 'peristyle', proving that a peristasis was not a feature restricted to religious architecture in the G period. In the interior, several round pits were detected, associated with various floor levels. Judging by the discovery inside the pits of smithing bottoms, these may be safely identified as kilns for iron smithing. To the SW of the building a ceramic kiln belonging to the final use of the area was also found. Immediately to the E lay oval building B-F, measuring 8.50 by 5.10m. (Fig. 15 middle). Two post holes similar to those associated with building A were identified around the edifice. Here at least two building phases were observed. A stone paving was associated with the first building period. Two hearths were identified, one circular approximately in the middle of the N part, the other rectangular lined with mud bricks against the apse. During the final phase it seems that the buildings served as an enclosure in the open air: a stone bench, partly over- lapping the W wall of the original building, belongs to this final phase. A pottery kiln, associated with the last period of use of the structure, was found in the S half of the edifice.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Two apsidal or oval buildings, A and IB, lay farther to the E, but their state of preservation is fragmentary. In between there is another oval building, E. Judging by the stratigraphy, these structures must be among the earliest within the industrial quarter. In the E part of the excavated area a roughly square peri- bolos wall enclosed several buildings (Fig. 15, background); the question of the precise function of the peribolos, as well as of the edifices it encloses, has to remain open until the completion of the excavation of this area, which has been scheduled for 1997. The exterior N and E sides of the peri- bolos were lined by a stone packing, presumably to provide protection from the surrounding marsh and the torrent or river which passed farther to the E. Two curved walls at the W side of the enclosed area belong to two superimposed oval buildings which were fully excavated in 1996 (Fig. 16, foreground). Building I, which measures 7.30 by 4.50m, continues beneath the peribolos wall. An earlier curved peribolos, interrupted by drains at regular intervals, bordered this structure on the N. Approximately in the middle of the oval building there was a flat stone, presumably an axial post base, surrounded by a pebbled floor. A post hole surrounded by a stone packing which was detected near the entrance perhaps represents all that remains of a peristyle similar to that surrounding building A. The function of this edifice is not yet ascertained; it appears to have been used for a rather short period and to have suffered a destruction due to an inundation. Building I was replaced by a building similar in shape, size and orientation, dubbed IA. Two flat stone slabs on the outside of the S side may represent bases for wooden posts. The building was intensively used for several decades, as suggested by both the finds and the numerous floors, and was presumably associated with metalwork. Building 0 was detected in 1985 (cf. Fig. 15, background) and fully investigated in 1996 (Fig. 16, background). It was determined that it underwent three major modifications: at first the plan was oval and the building measured 9.80 x 4.70m and had a stone socle half a metre high. The interior was divided into two roughly equal chambers by a cross wall. In the back chamber, a stone bench 1m wide ran along the interior face of the foundation. During the second phase a rectangular compartment was added at the S. Thus, the edifice became apsidal and its length was enlarged to 12.00m. Three large stone blocks near the SW corer suggest that the entrance was not axial but faced W, instead. The position of the new entrance may have been conditioned by a rectangular chamber, Z, which was built at the same time just to the S of building O, leaving a narrow corridor in between. During the third and final period the edifice was converted once more into an oval one by adding a stone foundation 0.30m high immediately on top of the base of the first oval structure. Unlike the neighbouring oval buildings, the architectural details and especially the finds indicate that 0 was not directly connected with metalworking activities. Several vases of fine ware were associated with the floors, but coarse household wares were also plentiful, including some crude lamps which appear to be the earliest in the sequence of Gr lamps of the historical era. The same room also yielded two bronze pins and other metal objects, while a bronze bell-pendant was found lying on the bench. Building O was apparently the most important building within the industrial complex. The idea that it was a religious structure cannot be dismissed at present, but a ruler's house or an assembly hall appear to be better alternatives. One could even suggest that it served as the headquarters of the person who supervised the work in the industrial quarter. Fig. 16 Building IT is the earlier of the two round buildings. It consists of a circular foundation 3.85m in diameter. Three large river stones formed a rectangular free-standing bench near the N side. Several pits which contained ashes, charcoal, olive pips, slag, iron and obsidian tools, spindle whorls and loom weights were encountered, but it is not clear whether all these should be associated with the period of use of the round building, or with a preceding phase. On the floor, among other finds, were collected fragments of a terracotta figurine and an Egyptianizing scarab of faience. One could perhaps suggest that building IT was a small shrine within the industrial quarter, though, alternatively, it could have been associated with metalworking activities. Building H consists of a rather flimsy circular foundation, 2.15m in diameter. Two antithetical areas with ashes were identified on the clay floor, almost in contact with the interior face of the foundation. The N one contained sherds of hand- made vases and numerous burnt olive pips. This edifice is among the latest in the building sequence. The pottery from the floor is not very diagnostic, but some finds definitely date to the A period. The function of building H is still obscure, though provisionally one could suggest that it served as an area of storage for the fuel that was used in the kilns. Approximately 30 tombs, mostly belonging to children, were found all around the buildings, and in the midst of the working area. The majority are contemporary with the period of use of the industrial quarter. Children were buried in coarse jars or pithoi, or in shaft graves lined with mud bricks and covered with stone slabs. The funerary urns were usually set on one side and the opening was often sealed with a stone slab or the bottom of a large broken vase. The urns were placed in a shaft, which could be either shallow and roughly ovoid in shape, or deep and cylindrical or roughly conical in shape. Dragona reported that a few amphoras or large coarse vessels contained carbonized remains, including bones: these may represent adult cremations, though one should remain cautious until the bones have been studied. Often, the tombs were marked by a pile of stones (cf. Pithekoussai), while a crude or partly dressed low stone set in an upright position was sometimes placed as a sema. A few cist graves were also found. The only certain instance of an adult inhumation grave is a skeleton placed in a contracted position, without any grave offerings (cf. Pithekoussai). The grave goods were rather poor, consisting mainly of a few vases and sometimes including a few jewels. It seems that a common 15</page><page sequence="16">16 DAVID BLACKMAN f~_Te I:e' 4i- :~::- - e I'e' I I I- o:4 \ - O Fig. 17 practice was to smash intentionally near the grave various offerings, such as vases, terracotta animal figurines, and other items. Animal bones and sea shells, often calcinated, attest the practice of sacrifices and/or funerary meals near the grave. Concerning the pottery, the general impression that is emerging through its preliminary study is the strong connec- tions with Euboea, and Eretria in particular. However, Athenian LG and Protoattic is also represented among the finds, while imitations of PCor and Corinthianizing pottery form a signifi- cant portion of the material. Some finds denote contacts with the East; such 'Orientalia' include glass beads, a sealstone of steatite, the faience scarab mentioned earlier, a scaraboid of red serpen- tine engraved with a bird, and a flask in the form of a monkey. The site excavated may be plausibly identified with Homeric Graia (II. II, 498), which Thucydides (II, 23, 3), Aristotle (St. Byz. s.v. Tcvd&amp;ypa, 'Opor7c6), and Strabo (IX, 404) located in the surroundings of the town of Classical Oropos. The discovery by A. Dragona in the mid 80s of a substantial group of vases of the LPG and especially SPG styles (late 10th and 9th Cts BC) at Nea Palatia, some 600m to the E of the School property (O.T.E. plot), also strengthens this assumption. Classical Oropos presumably owes its name to the river or torrent which flooded the area of the metalworking quarter and led to its abandonment in the late 7th or early 6th Ct BC (cf. Ant. Chatzis, [08]MAqhna 41 [1929] 200-01). D. Knoepfler, on the other hand, has suggested on the basis of linguistic arguments that the name is a local variant of the name of the Boeotian river Asopos (Histoire et archeologie. Les Dossiers 94 [1985] 52), now a less likely hypothesis but one which also deserves serious consideration. According to an old and well known opinion the Graioi would have participated in the earliest colonisation movement of S Italy and would have joined the Euboeans in the founda- tion of Cyme; it is these Graians that the indigenous Italian people presumably first met and consequently all the new- comers may have become known to the local people as Grai(c)i. Since it is today accepted that one of the main objectives of the Greeks who established themselves in the W, and on Pithekoussai in particular, was the search for metals, one suspects that a group of Graioi followed the Eretrians to the W and settled on Pithekoussai and later at Cyme. This assumption becomes even more credible if one takes into consideration the testimonies of Stephanus of Byzantium and Nikokrates, who claimed that Oropos was a foundation of Eretria. The material from the O.T.E. plot, however, suggests that EIA Oropos was founded earlier than Eretria. A possible explanation of this situation could be that the LPG-SPG material from the O.T.E. plot may represent the original nucleus of the Graioi, while the remains at the O.Z.K. property may reflect the Eretrian interests in the area. Alternatively, Oropos may have been founded by Old Eretria. The continua- tion of the excavation and the study of the finds will perhaps provide answers to these important questions." Souli. At the Flerianos field, part of a rectangular tower was investigated, probably belonging to a R farm, while on Leophoros Marathonos, at the 34th km, 1km W of the Iseion, a complex of four circular pottery kilns was uncovered. Their method of construction (stone base, mud-brick superstructure), as well as the finds of a lamp and a bronze coin of the 3rd Ct AD, date the kilns to the LR period. (ADelt 69-70) Thorikos. Ancient metalworking installations were excavated in the modem town of Thorikos (K Metaxas plot), broadening our understanding of the extent and of the town planning of the anc. Deme of Thorikos. The excavations, which began in 1982 and were completed this year, revealed a complex of four washeries lined with waterproof plaster, and the residence of the owner of the operation, as well as other workshop areas to its E and S. The private residence consists of a central paved court and a number of rooms along its sides. The SW wing includes the secondary rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, lined with waterproof plaster and provided with a clay tub. Two smaller bathrooms were located to the E of the kitchen, facing the court. In the court was found a clay beehive lid, inscribed with the name OIAOKPATOY[Z], probably the name of the owner. Three rooms were excavated in the NE wing, the easternmost of which, identified as the andron, had a small vestibule and was provided with a plastered floor and walls; a kernos in one corer confirms the house cult of Demeter. The whole complex was dated by the pottery to the second half of the 5th Ct BC-4th Ct BC. (ADelt 66-9) B. Petrakos reports on the work of the AS in 1996 (Ergon 1996, 19-23). He describes a peculiar Doric building, with a solid partition-wall along its long axis dividing it into two equal aisles. In the drawn reconstruction of its ground-plan by Staes, Travlos and Bendorf the building has 14 by 7 columns and was entered through its long sides. However, the existence of the inner wall requires the replacement of some of the columns on the short sides by a solid wall (Fig. 17). Marble slabs found on the building's ruins probably belong to the inner wall. The appearance of this Doric building is unprecedented in Attica. Its two aisles practically form two joined stoas (30m long and 5.50m wide each). The gabled roof would be supported on the partition-wall, but the total absence of entablature members suggests that the building was left unfinished. It would have been constructed of mud-brick with only the lower parts of marble. Voula. Excavations in 1991 revealed a further part of the anc. Deme of Halae Aixonidae, including a shrine, dwellings, roads, and drainpipes. Parts of the latter, excavated at Odos Eleutherias 35, consisted of two parallel retaining walls, 20m long, designed to collect rain water and channel it into a roofed drain, rectangular in section, dated to the end of the 5th Ct BC- beginning of the 4th Ct BC. This drainage system lined the main road which connected the Deme of Halae with the shrine of Apollo Zoster and crossed the main cemetery of the Deme. Parts of the settlement of the Deme were discovered at Odos Papaflessa, Dragatsaniou, Zakynthou, and Seriphou, including anc. roads, retaining walls for terraces and remains of whole building blocks. At Odos Seriphou in particular, which lies in the SE part of the anc. Deme, was excavated a section of a road, also identified at Odos Ritsou, which crossed part of the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 17 anc. cemetery and eventually joined the main road at Odos Eleutherias. The earlier rock surface of the road preserved traces of wheel marks. In the same plot were also discovered a mid 4th Ct BC shrine of the usual type, within a peribolos, with an eschara/hearth opposite the entrance. Foundations of 5th Ct BC buildings were identified to the E and W of the shrine, and remains of 4th Ct BC constructions in the NW corer of the area. Foundations of a large P-shaped funerary peribolos, of the early 4th Ct BC, were excavated at Odos Ritsou. Finally, a surface survey of the Punta peninsula, where a N settlement had been located by Theochares, and of the Katramonesi islets (anc. Hydroussa), yielded pottery, founda- tions of buildings and harbour installations ranging in date from the LN to R times. It seems that both areas were part of a network of settlements ranged along the W coast of Attica and on the nearby islets. (ADelt 59-62) ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, etc. Aigina, Kolonna. The 1996 excavations were directed by Profs F. Felten and S. Hiller, whose report is translated here: "The continuation of the excavations of the PR inner city of Aigina-Kolonna, started before the war by G. Welter, were concentrated in 1996 on the area immediately W of the E/MBA fortifications near the N gate (houses 21, 22, 23, 11; open area between houses 21 and 22). The aim was to find the connections between the settlement phases of the inner city and the building phases of the fortification walls. House 21 is situated at the NE comer of the city area. On its N side the cliff falls away to the sea and remains of the city wall can no longer be seen here. It is not clear whether the N side of the settlement was without fortification, or whether the city wall collapsed in this area. The house shows several building phases: its latest state, with a small kitchen added on the E, belongs to MH. Below the building a curved wall was found running N-S, dating from the end of the EBA: another example of the popularity of curved walls in this phase, clearly also in Aigina. Earlier EH III phases were found under the rooms W of this one, confirmed in particular by sealed bothroi and several floors. Under the EH III strata remains of EH II walls came to light, and below these, as already observed in previous years, a densely packed layer of rubble lay immediately above the rock, contain- ing EH II and LN sherds, among them a highly stylized clay idol. In the open area west of the N gate, between houses 21 and 22, several surface layers belonging to the gate and the N street, which goes back to EH III, were removed; under them, remains of EH II and LN buildings were found. The most important result is the recognition that in EH III clearly a new building plan was followed and that the buildings of EH II date were much denser than was hitherto assumed. Older excavations here had brought to light only the remains of a single house (the 'dyer's house'), whose groundplan could be completed after excavations in house 22. Under a sequence of settlement strata dating to MH and EH III, the S front of the 'dyer's house' with the entrance was found. Assuming that the door was in the middle of the wall, the building seems to have had important dimensions (over 10m wide and ca 15m long), which are approximately those of the 'White House'. Apparently it was a three-roomed building with antae slightly protruding southwards. Excavations in houses 23 and 11 could not be completed, but under house 11 a sequence of settlement strata from MH and EH III, with pottery characteristic of these phases, came to light." Methana. At the site of the church of Ag. Konstantinos, on the E coast of the Methana peninsula, a scatter of sherds revealed the existence of a prehistoric settlement. Excavation of the area to the W of the church yielded the remains of four rooms, part of a larger LH III complex. Room A had a religious function, judging by the 150 clay figurines discovered on a small square stepped construction against its N wall. Most of the figurines represented animals, especially bovids, and reflect all stages from naturalism to stylisation. Apart from the single female figurine, the most interesting group are the multi-figured examples, some of which represent very rare types, including two-man chariots, horse and rider, bulls with bull leapers and bovids with harness. The absence of the common D and ' types of female figurines, the dominance of the bovids and the close association of human figures with horses, chariots or bovids, suggest that the deity worshipped was male and was probably attributed the qualities later associated with Poseidon. The rest of the finds include pottery (kylikes), a triton shell, probably used as a musical instrument, and a pig's head rhyton. Along the S wall extended a low platform of stone slabs, while the floor was of trodden earth and pebbles. In the SE corner there was a hearth, built of small stones, with a paved floor full of ashes and animal bones. The pottery in the room dates it to the LH IIIA-B period, primarily the latter. Room B, to the N of room A, was also provided with a hearth at its NW corner and contained a number of tripod cooking pots and other household pottery. It was probably used for the preparation of official ban- quets. Room r had a paved floor of unworked stones, curiously enough, cut through by a child's grave of the LH IIIB period. Room B, to the S of room A, was possibly used as a workshop area, judging by the stone tools found there, while room E, to the W of room F, was only partly investigated. It probably belonged to the last architectural phase, since it partly overlaps room r, and its pottery can be dated to the beginning of the LH IIIC period. (ADelt 71-4) KORINTHIA Corinth. The 1991 ASCS excavations (ADelt 46, 109-10) were already reported in AR 1991-92, 10-11. Charles K. Williams reports on the ASCS excavations at Anc. Corinth in 1996: "The purpose of the 1996 campaign within Frankish levels S of the archaeological site museum was largely meant to complete the investigation of monuments already uncovered in the area and to clarify details in anticipation of the final publication of the exposed Frankish monuments. Probes were made within the portico that runs the length of the E side of Frankish unit 1, making possible a tentative reconstruction of the facade. Excavation also cleared the NW corner of the garden of the unit. Here was found a deep pit with an octagonal foundation around its mouth, an installation that appears to have been used for a very short time as a refuse pit for garbage from a dining area, then as a cesspit and finally as the receptacle for destruction debris from the Catalan sack of ca AD 1312. Investigation in 1996 at the SE corner of unit 1 completed the excavation of unit 5, of which the corridor and part of a tiled room had been cleared in 1995. This year the N end of a separate series of rooms was found to extend Sward from unit 5. Unit 5 abuts the S wall of unit 1 and was meant to control traffic that passed along an E-W road that entered the public square E of units 1 and 5. Before construction of unit 5, however, passage along that roadway appears to have been unrestricted.</page><page sequence="18">18 DAVID BLACKMAN Excavation was also made along the whole of the N-S roadway that passed along the W side of unit 1. The main pur- pose of excavation here was to determine the limits of the area of occupation on the W side of the street and what use was being made of that area during the 2nd half of the 13th Ct. Unit 3, opposite the NW comer of unit 1, appears to have been a large complex of rooms, radically changing its function and plan over short periods of time. The S end of unit 3 may, however, have been an independent building with a hearth and a large storage bin or silo. Unit 4 lies W of the SW corer of unit 1 and appears to have been a second single-roomed structure with hearth. If these two rooms with hearth were independent houses, then either the sleeping quarters were only undifferentiated parts of the rooms with hearths, or the two rooms were constructed each with a loft above part or most of the ground floor space. In the Frankish period apparently no building was con- structed between units 3 and 4. What had stood on this spot in the 12th Ct was a Byz bath. After that building collapsed, it was left in ruins and, apparently, never built upon in the Frankish period except in the area of the furnace room of the bath and its two flanking chambers. These were covered by Frankish unit 4. Further W, where excavation was conducted in 1986, 1987 and 1988, the stratigraphy attests to no Frankish occupation; the only Frankish activity here appears to have been the occasional dumping of garbage over the surface or the digging of pits for more of the same. Excavation also was conducted within unit 2, N of unit 1. Here the focus was twofold, First, it was hoped that the plan of the Frankish extension N of the church would become clear with further investigation. Excavation between 7.50 and 17.25m N of the church has only shown that rooms there may not all have been part of a single complex dependent upon the church. Rather, it seems likely that the two northernmost exposed rooms may well be independent shops and may both have had doorways that opened onto the N-S roadway that is adjacent to the E wall of unit 2. Secondly, excavation within area 4 of unit 2 (room D of the Byz 12th Ct complex that abutted the W wall of the narthex) has shown that the Franks converted area 4 into a burial ground, and over a rather short period of time, perhaps no more than 60 years, interred well over 100 persons therein. The final count is still to be made, however, since excavation of the graveyard is far from complete. Excavation of this area is hoped to be accomplished in the 1997 excavation season. To the SE of the main archaeological zone of anc. Corinth, close to the present-day village school, Guy Sanders continued investigation, for the second straight year, of an LR bath building. The bath is well preserved to just above floor level with large areas of its marble veneer still preserved in situ. Its small-scale cruciform plan suggests that the building may be part of a larger private complex. The foundations of the bath appear to have been sunk through three strata of earlier habitation. One stratum is represented by a series of rather crude walls that are not oriented according to the centuriated city plan; the occupation level below that is represented by a fall of wall plaster, apparently decorated in panels, but also with at least one large- scale figure, probably a Victory with wreaths. Now exposed underlying the fall of plaster are portions of a single course of a well-built stone wall or socle. These earlier levels have only been distinguished along the S side of the bath and there only in small areas. Sanders also directed the excavation of a second set of trenches originally opened by the Archaeological Service; these trenches had exposed an atrium of a villa or large R town house. The atrium had a marble impluvium, as well as a large expanse of decorated mosaic floor surrounding the impluvium. The original Greek trench was expanded this year along its E, N and W sides. More of the mosaic flooring has now been exposed, but no exterior walls of the villa have yet been dis- covered. Although one room has a complex mosaic pattern in its floor, as does the atrium with the impluvium, no panels pre- serve representations of animals or humans. No destruction debris with domestic furnishings, utensils or equipment has yet been found, although in certain places tile destruction debris was found directly covering the R floors. The construction date of the R villa has yet to be determined." Isthmia. The 1991 seasons of the Ohio State University and University of Chicago expeditions (ADelt 46, 108-9) were already reported in AR 1991-92, 11 (T. Gregory and E. Gebhard), except for the study of the 8th-5th Ct finds from the well. Elizabeth R. Gebhard reports on the University of Chicago excavations in 1996: "Major attention was devoted to restored drawings of the Rachi Settlement and to conservation and landscaping in the Sanctuary of Poseidon. Isthmia VII (I. Raubitschek, Metal Objects) and VIII (C. Morgan, Mycenaean Settlement and Early Iron Age Sanctuary) are in press; volumes on the Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman pottery, Arms and Armor, the Archaic temple, and the Rachi Settlement make excellent progress at the hands of several authors. The Rachi Settlement (Fig. 18). An unusual feature of the small settlement on the ridge above the Sanctuary of Poseidon is the presence, in six of the houses, of cement-lined working floors and vats adjacent to the courtyard. Although they were originally interpreted as dye-works, these installations now seem more likely to have been used for processing olive oil. In each case, the sacks of olives were pressed on the floor by the use of a winch and lever press; one of the two adjacent vats served as a container for the mixture of oil and water from the press floor and the other for the oil after separation. Reconstructions were made of the working areas in Houses III and IV (Fig. 19). Houses II, X and XI with the adjoining streets, stairways, and well were restored as examples of structures that preserve details most characteristic of the settlement (Figs. 20, 21). A catalogue of terracotta beehives from the settlement and from the sanctuary will be published in conjunction with a forthcoming article by Richard Evershed on the evidence of beeswax found in samples of the vases. The hives have the form of an open vessel with a small opening at the base and grooves on the inside. Lids covered the top. At this point they seem to constitute the only example of the top bar hive known from antiquity. Archaic Temple of Poseidon. A block belonging to the S wall of the pronaos was discovered to be in its original position, thus adding to the very few blocks of the temple that remain in situ. Another block, this time from one of the end walls of the cella, was identified near the SE gate of the R temenos. In conjunction with conservation work in the temple, two new sections were drawn through the building, and sections were made of the pilaster cuttings and post holes. N and E gateways. Blocks and painted roof tiles were identified belonging to two small buildings of appropriate scale and date to have stood on the foundations for the N and E entrances to the temenos in the 4th Ct BC. Restored drawings were made (Figs. 22, 23).</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 19 + +_ I-»» /"I "!""1110"w*T -.,: ., ROMAN ?ir bATU r " TW,ATER , (//^^r"'"'" I :o - , ... + SANCTUARY OF\ / / + + I + STMADIUM RA.5C H A~~~Z~' ""a 'in ',/ Fig. 18</page><page sequence="20">20 DAVID BLACKMAN SECTION A-A SECTION B-B UOU5E III RECON3TRUCTION i PLAN OLIVE PRESSES wOU3E IV PLAN Fig. 21 Ceramics. The catalogue texts for selected vessels from the period ca 300 BC to ca AD 600 were put into final order and over 151 drawings added to the 21 pages of figures for the volume. Tables were prepared to show percentages of local and imported fine wares, cooking wares, and coarse wares; the sequence of selected dated deposits was documented. The SW Reservoir produced evidence for use of the system in the C period. Its abandonment around 180-160 BC was marked by a dumping of table and cooking wares that give a representative picture of Cor household pottery after ca 200 BC. From deposits of the later 1st Ct AD, a variety of Cor thin- walled wares and their various Italian and Asia Minor counter- parts was documented. The LR (post-cult) material, relatively rich in imports, seems to show an impoverishment of the local workshops. The moment of abandonment of the Theatre Caves in the late 4th Ct AD is represented by a complete coarse ware jar found where it had apparently been left on one of the dining couches. Study of the ceramics from ca 550 BC to ca 300 BC refined dates of selected deposits from the 5th and 4th Ct in the sanctuary, and the chronology of certain Conventionalizing pottery styles was debated on the basis of deposits from the Rachi. For the publication of A pottery under preparation by Karim Arafat, the complex figure scenes were drawn and entered on computer. Loomweights. The 446 loomweights from the Rachi Settlement and the sanctuary were photographed, and detailed pictures were taken of 259 stamps and incisions. Study of profiles, forms, and patterns of wear on the weights clarified the method of manufacture and use on the loom. Site studies. Problems of Isthmian topography were reviewed with special attention to the contours of the central plateau. A series of constructions identified by Broneer as belonging to a Myc fortification wall were re-examined, together with previously excavated remains W of the Rachi Settlement and in the SE Valley. Conservation. The W waterworks, a small sunken bathing area of C date lying W of the Temple of Poseidon, was conserved by removing and resetting the waterproof cement Fig. 19 Fig. 20</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 21 0 Im FPH 1996 0 Im FtpH I 0 I 4m Fig. 22 that lined the cistern and adjacent floor, bench and stairways. Since excavation by Broneer in 1953-55, the marl from which the features were cut has been eroded and should be covered. Plans were drawn for a light roof that would protect the monument. Removal of the excavation dump (1953-60) from the NE end of the central plateau of the sanctuary has opened up the site so that the R bath and theatre are visible from the Temple of Poseidon. In the E and N temenos, trenches were filled to R levels and visitors can now move easily around the site. R piers in the NE cave were repaired, as were other walls throughout the sanctuary. Isthmia Museum. Several leaks in the roof require immediate attention to prevent damage to the antiquities. In anticipation of a new roof that will very likely close the sky lights, preliminary plans were drawn for renovation of the sanctuary exhibits. A video installation that will give visitors a brief history and tour of the site in several languages is in preparation. As part of the presentation, restorations of the sanctuary at nine points in its history are being entered into AutoCAD." Timothy E. Gregory reports on the Ohio State University excavations in 1996: "With the assistance of the 4th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities (Nauplion) and the 6th Ephorate of Byz Antiquities (Patras), we carried out a program of study and research at Isthmia for the ASCS in June to avgust 1996. Research this year again focused especially on the R bath to 0 I 4m Fig. 23 the N of the Temple of Poseidon. Architectural study and recording was co-ordinated by Fikret Yegiil, assisted by Omiir Harmansah. The full architectural documentation of the building was virtually completed, including inking of a total of eleven detailed sections through the bath, all done at a scale of 1:50. Substantial quantities of soil from previous excavations were removed from the W side of the bath, allowing more detailed study of the decoration and heating system in this part of the building. Ms. Jane Philipp pursued her study of the Odecoration of the interior of the R bath, with this year's work focusing on the marble used in the building. As a result she was able to identify a large marble basin that must have stood in the S apse of room IX, the first piece of bath furniture to be discovered in the building. She has to date been able to identify, aside from the standard white, some ten different types of marble, including cipollino and flor di pesco from Euboea, verde antico from Thessaly, breccia di Settebasi from Skyros, Proconnesian marble from the Sea of Marmara, Docimion white and pavonazzetto marbles, africano from Teos on the W coast of Asia Minor, and breccia corallina from Bithynia. Study of some 6462 fragments of coloured marble from room IX has already provided important information, not only about the original opulent decoration of the room, but also of its condition when the vaults of the building collapsed at the end of antiquity.</page><page sequence="22">22 DAVID BLACKMAN Prof. Yegiil had already raised the question of whether the extant remains might not represent two major construction phases, both probably in the 2nd Ct AD. Further investigation of the architecture as well as the finds discovered in excavation seem to confirm this idea. Drs Kathleen Slane and John Hayes this year examined the pottery from selected areas of the R bath. Research also continued in the area of the so-called E Field, E of the Temple of Poseidon, partially excavated by Prof. Paul Clement for UCLA in 1970-1972. Basic for this investigation is an electronic 'plan' of the area, created largely by Ms Kathryn Connor. This plan shows some 185 individual walls in this area, divided into at least nine different construction techniques. Detailed consideration of the areas where excava- tion has already been carried out shows several periods of construction and use. Tentatively, these suggest an original construction phase in the middle years of the 2nd Ct AD, with major re-buildings in the mid-3rd, 5th, and 7th Ct. It is still not possible to elucidate the precise function of the buildings in this area and their relationship to the sanctuary itself, although progress toward this end has clearly been made and we are in the process of compiling a preliminary report on the excava- tions in the E Field. Progress was made in the conservation of ceramic material and in the proper storage of all classes of objects, along with the enhancement of our conservation database and further plans for long-term conservation of all material excavated by the teams over the years. Conservation of the monochrome mosaic in room VI of the R bath was essentially completed during the 1995 season. Work during 1996 concentrated largely on repairs necessitated by damage during the winter and consolidation of the sides of the mosaic. Some conservation remains to be done on the interior of the mosaic. We await approval of our request to erect a roof over room VI of the bath to protect this important monument. An important innovation this year was the inauguration of the Hexamilion Spolia Project, a joint undertaking carried out in conjunction with the 6th (Byzantine) Ephorate and the University of Chicago Excavations at Isthmia. This project seeks to identify, describe, photograph, draw, and study all anc. blocks that were built into the Hexamilion, the E Med wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, either at the time of its original construction in the 5th Ct AD or later. Although the primary goal for the first year of project was development of procedures for the identification and recording of the spolia built into the wall, two teams were at work in the field for most of the season and a total of some 200 blocks were identified, described, photographed, and drawn. These teams were led by Frederick Schultz (OSU) and Jon Frey (UC Berkeley). It is expected that this project will result in signifi- cant new information about the anc. buildings in or near the Sanctuary, as well as those from elsewhere on the Isthmus of Corinth. In addition to these projects, work was carried out on a number of detailed individual studies of considerable signifi- cance. These included examination of the Med settlement in the area of the Fortress, and the human skeletal materials. Study continued of the so-called 1969-72 Dump, a group of artefacts numbering over 133,000 which provides considerable informa- tion about trade and economic patterns on the Isthmus of Corinth in the R period. Finally, we were able to improve security at the site by construction of two new iron gates, one at the entrance to the OSU laboratory area, the other at the E entrance to the R bath." Mapsos. The church of Agios Nikolaos in the mountainous region between Solomos and Chiliomodio, in the Mapsos region (Theopompos' Mausos) has undergone a number of building phases that were investigated. The current structure is a single-aisle chapel with a pitched roof and tripartite sanctuary articulated on the exterior. The original form of the church has yet to be established, but sections of two older parallel walls terminating in an apse have been found running under the floor from W to E. The S-most of these walls extends outside the present building. Nineteen pit burials were found associated with this structure. Finds included: a hyperpyron of Isaac II (1185-1195), a Byz glazed plate bearing a liturgical inscription, perforated glass paste tesserae, buttons, fragments of glass vessels, fragments of postByz wall-paintings. The undetermined Byz phase was succeeded by a postByz structure. (ADelt 179-80) Nemea. Stephen Miller (ASCS) reports on work in 1996: "Work at the site of Nemea in 1995 included significant progress on the final publications of the volumes on the Stadium and on the Coins, and on preparations for the five years of large-scale excavations scheduled to begin in 1997. The latter work included repairs to fencing and the installa- tion of new gates that will facilitate the removal of excavated earth, and the setting of new benchmarks that will be used in recording the new discoveries. The most significant work, however, concerned the cleaning of the Nemea river in an attempt to avoid future flooding of the type that occurred in the winter of 1995/96. The river cleaning revealed that about 1.25m of silted fill had accumulated in the past 115 years. The removal of that fill will automatically lower the water table in the Sanctuary of Zeus by that amount, and help with the run-off of winter rains and summer storms. The river cleaning also revealed that the modem course of the Nemea river is not in the anc. course which appears to lie 10-15m farther to the W. Hence, we now know that the French engineers who were responsible for draining the Nemea valley in 1881 created a new river in its present course. As had been revealed already in 1924 by the excavations of Hill and Blegen, that river course cut through the anc. bath and caused consid- erable damage. We now know-thanks to the work of 1996- that the removal of the river from the bath also caused damage to antiquities, for it cut through an extensive layer of deliber- ately placed white earth and through the drain that ran from the 4th-Ct bath westward to the anc. river. That drain was covered by a series of hard limestone blocks cut as starting lines for an early 5th-Ct race track, but re-used as covers for the drain. This may, then, be the first indication of the location of the original stadium of the Nemean Games." Stymphalos. Dr H. Williams reports on the excavations of 1995-96: "The University of British Columbia/Canadian Institute at Athens excavations at the site of anc. Stymphalos continued in the summers of 1995 and 1996. Work concentrated on the acropolis sanctuary (possibly to Athena, as Orlandos found an inscription with IlOAIAA... on it in the area 70 years ago), houses and roads in the SE area of the lower town, the SW area of the city's fortifications, and in 1996 on an area called 'Monastiraki' about 2km N of the city at the N edge of the moder village of Stymphalia (which we dug jointly with the Nauplion Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities). Geophysical and topographical survey in 1982-4 had revealed that anc. Stymphalos had been laid out on an</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 23 orthogonal plan; excavation sought to clarify when the founda- tion took place and how long the site existed. The general picture that emerged from the ceramic and lychnological evidence is that the site in its present form was laid out towards the middle of the 4th Ct BC, abandoned around the middle of the 2nd Ct BC (perhaps as a result of R military activity during the Achaean War), and resettled for a time in the 1st and early 2nd Ct AD. There is also some limited evidence of a further resettlement in the 6th Ct AD. The acropolis sanctuary (temple, altar, and auxiliary building) proved an unexpectedly rich source of finds, includ- ing a half life size fragmentary marble kore of the LA period (probably Attic), part of a LC marble 'temple boy', much bronze and a little gold jewellery (the latter with EHL parallels from Macedonia), and over 100 iron missile projectile points, probably from catapult darts. The latter may well have come from a siege, as there is some evidence of burning and in the destruction debris are long petalled molded bowls of mid 2nd Ct BC date. The temple itself was small (11 x 6m) with a lime- stone socle and mud-brick superstructure; it preserved traces of red painted wall plaster and at its entrance we found founda- tions for five steps and a cutting for a round perirrhanterion base. A well preserved bronze phiale mesomphalos with a nail hole through it also appeared in the temple fill along with a small bronze rabbit. The project also investigated the nearby city wall and towers to the S, including an unusual hexagonal artillery tower built over an earlier semicircular tower. Traces of structures with tiled roofs were found along the inside of the wall along with a fine bronze bowl abandoned im down in the fill behind the wall. The lower site provided a conspectus across the breadth (30m) of an entire city block as well as the 6m wide roads running N-S on either side. In early R times there seem to have been at least two successive periods of encroachment of one house onto the public roadway. The condition of the houses is very poor due to ploughing and to frequent flooding by the lake since antiquity. One, however, seems to have had a kopron and we also found two wells. The roads show evidence of at least five periods of rebuilding and were well constructed with a distinct camber and drains down the sides. The 'Monastiraki' site was particularly interesting as we found remains of a C Doric structure, probably a temple, with columns nearly im across and marble roof tiles. The site also produced our first burial, probably ECh, to judge from the E-W orientation and scattered grooved sherds, in a well built cist grave. A large-scale geophysical survey employing resistivity and earth conductivity meters, ground penetrating radar, and proton magnetomer added considerable detail to earlier work both in the city and outside; it revealed substantial rectangular structures in the marshy area near the lake SW of the city wall, for example." ARGOLIS Argos. The work of the French School in 1991 (ADelt 46, 110- 13) was already reported in AR 1991-92, 12-13 (M. Pierart and A. Pariente). There were 24 rescue excavations reported at the modem city of Argos, the vast majority of which (23 out of 24) involved remains of G to Byz date. The only excavation of pre- historic remains was located at Parodos Perseos, a total of six tombs, one of which was a built Rho-type tomb with an entrance, of LH I-II date. It was provided with a dromos and an entrance on the S side, with a partly built doorway, a paved floor and a flat roof. The remaining five tombs, (one pithos burial, one cist and three piloperiktistoi), were of MH date. A deposit of MH date was also identified on the W side of Prophetes Elias, in the area of Deirada. The historical remains include parts of roads, in use from EA to LR or even Byz times, parts of buildings, both houses and workshops, and clusters of tombs, parts of cemeteries ranging from G to LR times. At Odos Gounare, an anc. road with a pebble surface, running E-W, was provided with a central terracotta drainpipe on its S side; this drainpipe was joined, at its W end, by two smaller ones, channelling water from nearby houses. Complexes of HL and R rooms line the road on both sides. At the junction of Odos Sephere and Ag. Konstandinou, a gravel road, used during the HL and R periods, was associated with one of the two building complexes excavated in the area, of R date; the other post-dated the road (LR). At the junction of Odos Messenias and Arkadias, part of an anc. road was excavated in association with a HL workshop and a kiln of the same date. At Odos Kophiniotou three anc. roads were discovered, with many successive periods of use, ranging from the 4th Ct BC to the R period. Other fragmentary remains in the vicinity of these roads include a LG-EA well, containing rubbish from a kiln, an A floor and pithos burial, two C wells, part of a rectangular R kiln with a circular internal support, a R bothros and finally, part of a R pottery workshop. Other sections of anc. roads were identified at Odos Kophiniotou 27, at Parodos Kapodistriou (5th Ct BC-R), at Odos Kapodistriou 14 (HL-LR/Byz), at Plateia Demokratias, at Odos Gounare 45 and at Odos Karpetopoulou (R). Parts of two buildings, dating from the 6th Ct BC down to the 3rd Ct BC, were excavated at Parodos Odou Belinou; in one of the houses (6th-4th Ct BC) a number of clay model columns was found. At Odos Papaoikonomou, the remains of an EHL villa were discovered, outside the city walls, with five rooms and traces of a mosaic floor. At Odos Kavaphe and at the junction of Odos Messenias and Arkadias, to the SE of modem Argos, the remains were excavated of a rectangular building with two rooms, which was used as a bronzeworking establishment from HL to R times. In a pit near the building was deposited a unique find, part of a miscast bronze standing male statue with himation, probably meant to be melted down (lst-2nd Ct AD). In the same plot were also discovered one LA and three E Byz-M Byz bothroi. Finally, at Odos Gounare 95 a large R house was excavated with five rooms and a paved courtyard with a drainage network. The most abundant finds in the moder city were tombs. The G period represented by 45 tombs, mostly built cists, as well as some pit graves, pithos burials and larax burials. They were found in small clusters of two to nineteen tombs, all over the city of Argos, apparently reflecting the loose habitation pattern of the period. Larger clusters were excavated at the junction of Odos Messenias and Arkadias (19), together with six G bothroi, at Odos Theophanopoulou 14 (7) and at the junction of Odos Sephere and Ag. Konstandinou (6). Among the latter, one of the cist tombs was provided with a hole bored through the cover slab, over the head of the dead, probably for some kind of ritual libations. As far as the later periods are concerned, a further part of the extensive necropolis of anc. Argos was excavated 400m to the</page><page sequence="24">24 DAVID BLACKMAN S of the S foot of the Larissa hill, at Odos Menandrou. The vast majority of the 75 tombs discovered on the site, which yielded over 100 offerings and ranged in date from the LA to the LHL period, were cists, 18 examples were pit graves, two were pithos burials and one was a clay larax burial. A funeral street ran between the rows of tombs of this well organized cemetery. Earlier and later use of the grounds includes remains of the G and the Christian periods. Finally, a pit, used for ritual purposes and used from the A period to the 4th Ct BC, was discovered at Parodos Odou Belinou. It was coated with clay and contained five mud bricks in an upright position. The finds include female busts, animal figurines, astragaloi, olive pips, animal bones, clay plaques and 5th-4th Ct BC pottery. Clay beds of the C-R periods were identified at Parodos Kapodistriou. (ADelt 88-104) Important remains of various building phases were found in the Makrygianni plot, in an excavated area of 202m2. Remains of roughly built walls were uncovered 1.90m below present ground level, some of the walls preserving a height of up to a metre. Different floor surface levels (sometimes of pebble and mortar, others made of clay tile) distinguish the different periods. Part of a drainage system was uncovered, probably associated with evidence for cleansing facilities which came to light in the N part of the site. Stone-built cisterns to the W contained domestic pottery and loom weights of the 11-12th Ct AD, and indicate, along with some of the meagre movable finds found on the site, that a settlement of some kind existed here during that period. No dates were given for the earlier phases. Remains of an EByz settlement came to light on Odos Gounari 45 on top of remains of LG to R phases. Domestic houses, parts of a built water supply and drainage system, pottery (G to LByz, but mostly EByz), coins (unspecified), a bronze ring, and a bronze cross, along with (anc.?) figurine fragments were amongst the finds. (ADelt 129-30) Excavations on the Aspis in 1996 are described by Gilles Touchais and Anna Philippa-Touchais (French School): "In 1996, while continuing the study of the pottery at the museum, we set to work on the site on a complete clearance of the two areas excavated between 1974 and 1990 (N &amp; SE) in order to complete the planning of the architectural remains. This last task, undertaken by Y. Rizakis, enabled us to establish in a definitive way the sequence of the MH and LC buildings. It also enabled us to define some architectural details, notably the position of the apertures of the large extended rectangular building which represents, in the SE area, the last phase of MH occupation. We are therefore now in a position to propose a Fig. 24 graphic reconstruction of the two main phases of MH construction in this area of the settlement. The work was completed with the erection of a wooden fence around this area (Fig. 24: view from the N) the study for which had been carried out in 1995. With the complex of buildings cleared in the SE area now being better protected, one can envisage continuing under better conditions the work of restoration and presentation which has been under way for a number of years. For 1997 we plan the continuation of the study of the pottery in the museum at Argos as well as the study of the fauna. We hope also to make and put in place, in the SE area of the site, an explanatory panel with a plan of the remains and a diagrammatic restoration for the information of visitors." Gisele Hadji-Minaglou and Anastasia Oikonomou (French School) report on their research programme on the Argolid in Byzantine times: "Two periods of fieldwork were planned for the year 1996. The first was concerned with the survey of the area round the village of Chonika (now called Neo Heraion) by Anastasia Oikonomou and Gisele Hadji-Minaglou; the second with the photogrammetric survey of the Catholicon church of Hagia Moni, the churches of the Dormition of the Virgin of Chonika and of Argos, of the Transformation of Plataniti and of St. John of Ligourio by Andre Carrier and Gisele Hadji-Minaglou. As a result of the withdrawal of Andre Carrier, the programme of surveys was replaced by the one planned for 1997, that is to say, the plans and part of the cross-sections of the above churches (with the exception of the Dormition of the Virgin already published). Surveys: District of Chonika. The earth road which passed in front of the church of Hagia Sotira between the villages of Aniphi and Chonika (see BCH '84) and where in 1991 some blocks had been recorded, had since then been widened, so that all trace of the blocks had disappeared. Besides this, the orange groves in the vicinity of the building had become inaccessible as a result of the size of the trees, and also the fences recently put up. The survey was therefore directed rather towards the area N of Chonika, towards the Heraion. The remains of two Byz buildings were recorded on the road which leads to Mycenae and near the Heraion. These are the remains of Agia Marina and Agioi Anargyroi. Both were buried and only the alignments of the walls appeared, level with the surface. The church of Agia Marina is characterized by an iconosta- sis. The sherds found on the site of Agia Marina indicate that it is a MByz building. The remains of Agioi Anargyroi were still visible before the construction, relatively recent, of the present church. A clearing of the surface and some soundings made it possible to determine more precisely the date of construction, and then destruction of the two churches, as well as to judge their extent and their importance for the history of the architec- ture of the area in Byz times. District of Argoliko. The cemetery church, dedicated to the Annunciation (Panagia Evangelistria) is to all appearances llth-Ct. On a simple cross plan, the cupola rests on the pillars of the sanctuary and two columns. The facades on the E, S and N are covered with several coats of lime-wash. Some anc. pieces have been built into the masonry. The western facade is hidden by the recently constructed narthex. Two architraves and six columns of the ECh period, reused, adorn the comers of the drum of the cupola. This building is not protected by law, but a request for protection will be made by us to the 5th Ephorate of Sparta. The dossier will contain the photographs of</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 the facades and a plan. In order to undertake a complete architectural study and to date the building it will be necessary to remove the coats of paint which hide the masonry of the facades. At the time of the survey of the Dormition of the Virgin of Merbaka in 1980 some columns coming, it seems, from an ECh building had been recorded in the village of Argoliko. According to the inhabitants of the village they had been taken from a church recently demolished. The columns have today disappeared, but the building to which they belonged was recorded on the ground. It was situated on the road which links the village of Argoliko to that of present-day Hagia Triada (anc. Merbaka) 900m from the Dormition of the Virgin. It was possible to find the building thanks to some stones piled on the edge of a field. (It was to allow for the cultivation of this field that the church was demolished.) It is possible that the foundations may still be in situ. A church dedicated to Agios Ioannis Theologos has been constructed on the side of the road in memory of the anc. church. District of Prosymna. To the W of the village of Prosymna three buildings which attest the occupation of the area in Byz times have been recorded. The first, the church of the village cemetery, Agios Athanasios, is situated about 700m from the edge of the village; the second, the church of Agioi Theodoroi, is 700m farther W and the third, Agios Georgios, 250m N of the second. The church of Agios Athanasios is not of the Byz period but the column re-used in its porch, fragments of ECh sculpture and two ionic capitals of the late Empire built into the masonry of the sanctuary attest the existence of ECh remains in the sur- rounding area. The church of Agioi Theodoroi is buried to at least 2.50 m. The plan is that of a basilica with one nave. The only apse in the sanctuary takes up the entire width of the nave. This is a very anc. building, possibly even of the R period. Indeed, a walled-up door in the N wall of the sanctuary indicates the original ground level, which must have been roughly the same as that of the R period baths situated several metres from it. The examination of the material found on the surface shows that there existed in this place a small agglomeration of the ECh period. The church of Agioi Theodoroi was perhaps part of it. Given the present state of the building, whose masonry is thickly plastered above ground level, it is impossible to draw any conclusion as to its date. For that purpose it would be necessary to remove the facing and also undertake a sondage to at least the original ground level in order to determine the causes of the formation of the fill into which the church is embedded. The church of Agios Georgios has a more direct interest for us. It is most probably a building of the 1st half of the 11th Ct, to judge by the treatment of the facing and also the plan. The numerous anc. and ECh re-used stones built into the masonry make us think that the site was occupied well before the 11th Ct. The excavation of the courtyard would allow one to define more precisely the character of the remains. District of Limnes. Situated NE of Prosymna, the territory of the Limnes district is very rich in Med remains unknown to researchers. For this reason it was decided to extend the survey to complement that of the adjacent district of Prosymna. Two areas have for the moment been examined. In the place called Ekklesies two churches were recorded. The walls of one just appear at ground level. It is still possible to make out an apse. The second is preserved to a height of about 2.50m. The walls are constructed in a Cyclopean style comparable with that of the churches of the Mani of the end of the 10th Ct or beginning of the 11th Ct (see BCH 1994). The area which surrounds this latter building is used at present as a sheep-fold. The first of the churches is on ground free from all planting and grazing. An excavation on this spot would pose no problem over permission. Clearance of the surface would enable one to determine the area of the building and a sondage would enable one to date it. The second could be cleared of the vegetation and debris which prevents one from walking round it and making a plan of it. At the place called Kolonitsa in a valley E of the village there was an agglomeration of the Byz period (sherds of the 12th and 13th Ct were found as well as ECh sherds). Three churches were recorded there. One dedicated to the Prophet Elijah (Prophetes Elias) is still standing, but as the walls are entirely rough cast, it is impossible to determine the period of its construction. The two others situated not far away are almost entirely buried, with the exception of a few adjoining stones at ground level. One of them is distinguished by two blocks engraved with crosses. The survey of the areas of Kolonitsa and Ekklesies is only at an initial stage. The isolation of the area and the lack of roads makes access difficult. Nevertheless, the wealth of their Byz remains justifies a close interest in spite of their distance from the areas initially proposed for the survey, which is concerned above all with the Argive plain. Ligourio. To help with the recording undertaken in the church of Agios Ioannis Eleimon, we visited several churches of the Venetian period which are preserved inside and outside the village. We were thus able to establish that the Dormition of the Virgin dating from the end of the 17th Ct rests on an older building whose outline has been preserved. This seems at first sight to be a church of the late llth/early 12th Ct. To be sure of this, however, a more detailed study is necessary. If our hypothesis proves right, the building would enrich the list of churches in the Argolid dating from this period (the Dormition of the Virgin of Chonika, the Dormition of the Virgin of Argos, St John the Theologian of Paligourio and St John of Ligourio). Recording: Plans and interior sections have been drawn (the exterior measurements will mostly be provided by photogram- metry) of the following churches: the Katholikon of Hagia Mone; the Metamorphosis of Plataniti; the Dormition of the Virgin of Chonika; St. John of Ligourio. One must add to these the plan of the church of the Annunciation of Argoliko as documentation for the request for protection, and the church of St George at Prosymna in order to start on its architectural study. Programmefor 1997: Surveys. It is proposed to continue the surveys of the districts of: Chonika in the direction of Mycenae to the N; Prosymna; Limnes, in particular the place called Migio, not yet surveyed this year. The post-Byz churches, in particular those listed as of the Venetian period, will be systematically visited in order to look for the possible presence of structures of the Byz period. Recording: We will undertake the photogrammetric record- ings of the Catholicon of Hagia Moni, the Dormition of the Virgin of Chonika, the Dormition of the Virgin of Argos, the Metamorphosis of Plataniti, St John Ioannis of Ligourio and possibly St George of Prosymna. In parallel, the sections drawn in 1996 will be completed and the architectural details will be drawn. It will then be possible to begin preparing the publication of the buildings." 25</page><page sequence="26">26 DAVID BLACKMAN Chelmi-(Schoinochori). Eight cist tombs, part of a cemetery belonging to an important settlement of the 5th-4th Ct BC, were discovered at the N. Deves field. There were no offerings. (ADelt 104) Dokos. T.E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on an architectural and archaeological survey of the E Byz Kastropoliteia: "The island of Dokos is a small rocky projection off the S coast of the Argolid between the islands of Hydra and Spetses. Today uninhabited, the island was occupied in the Myc period, and a famous BA wreck has been identified and excavated just off its coast. The location of Dokos, at the opening of the Gulf of Argos, placed it astride particularly important sea-lanes, especially those stretching from Cape Malea and the West to Athens and the N Aegean and Constantinople. During the Byz period the main route of communication with the West must have passed directly under the island's shores. Despite its barren and formidable aspect, the hill of the kastro on the E end of the island is crowned by an extensive fortification wall that encloses the remains of a substantial number of buildings, some of them (to judge by their size) of monumental character. A large settlement surrounded the fortified area on its three accessible sides and extended down to the well-protected harbour that lay along the N side of the island. Two present-day chapels were built on earlier founda- tions, and the remains of a possible large basilica can be seen within the fortifications of the kastro. No proper description or study of this large settlement has ever been made, but large quantities of pottery, lamps, and coins visible on the surface can all be assigned to the 7th Ct AD, from early in the reign of Heraklios to the 4th year of Constantine IV. In its location close to the coast and the nature of its archaeological remains, the settlement of Dokos resembles those sometimes identified (e.g. by G.L. Huxley) as 'isles of refuge' at various other places along the coast of Greece. More recent research suggests that the settlement on these 'desert islands' cannot be explained simply by a situation of flight from invading tribes, but rather as a result of economic forces or more broadly military policies and phenomena. The fortifi- cation and settlement on Dokos is the largest and potentially the most important of these E Byz island centres, and its examination and study promises to shed significant light on the period of the Byz 'Dark Ages'. The settlement on Dokos is the subject of a recent study (by Kyrou) which argues that it figured significantly in a story told in a narration of Paul of Monemvasia (10th Ct). According to the surviving Arabic translation of this account, the relics of three of the patron saints of Barcelona in Spain (Valerius, Vincent, and Eulalia) miraculously appeared at the castle of Ashab al Bakar, which has previously defied all attempts to locate the place. Kyrou, however, suggests the identity of this place as the kastro of Dokos described above. In July 1996, a team from the Ohio State University Excavations at Isthmia carried out an exploration of the area of the kastro on Dokos. Fieldwork consisted of the measurement of the walls of the kastro, the creation of a detailed topo- graphic plan, an examination of the structural and movable archaeological remains, and the examination of the church complex in the saddle to the S of the kastro. As a result of this fieldwork, the complete circuit of the fortress wall was plotted. The fortress wall is preserved to a height of up to ca im, but there are considerable distances, especially on the SE and the NW, where no wall was built since the steep declivity below the kastro provided adequate defence. The entire circuit of the kastro has a perimeter of ca 575.37m, and it encloses an area of 16,535m2. Two phases can clearly be identified in most parts of the wall: an outer facing, made of uneven small pieces of limestone set into place with large quantities of a hard white mortar, and an inner facing, made of generally larger uneven blocks of limestone, commonly laid without mortar. It is obvious that the inner surface was con- structed earlier, and the outer cemented face was added at a later date. A roughly N-S wall close to the W end of the kastro may represent a phase in which the fortifications were slightly smaller. Tentatively, then, we may suggest three phases of construc- tion: phase 1, in which the kastro's W end was partially constructed; phase 2, in which the walls were extended fully to the W; phase 3, in which the mortared surface was added to the wall of phase 1-2. No clear evidence of the date for these phases is available, although the overwhelming preponderance of surface pottery suggests that phases 1 and 2 may be assigned to the late 6th and mid 7th centuries respectively, while phase 3 may tentatively be associated with Morosini's known restoration of the kastro in the 1680s. Three roughly rectangular towers can be seen on the N, E and S sides, but a careful examination of these shows that they were constructed in phase 3. Likewise three gates pierce the fortification walls, two of them immediately adjacent to the towers. Presumably these gates were original to the earlier phases of the kastro. Within the kastro are the remains of many buildings, all of them nearly completely ruined. Further investigation would almost certainly allow the delimitation of many if not all of these structures. This year's work, however, resulted in the identification of the remains of two large complexes oriented roughly E-W-possibly large churches. One of these is located on the very summit of the hill, near the SE corer of the kastro. The other is on a small plateau, slightly lower and to the NW of the highest point. A number of cisterns were also identified, most of them located at or just above the fortification walls, although a well-built cistern was found along the S side of the second complex mentioned above. Some of the cisterns may be associated with phases 1-2, although at least a few of them were clearly part of the Venetian construction phase. To the E of the N gate, and just W of a large cistern that we were not able fully to plot, is a spring that according to local informants supplied copious quantities of fresh water until the early years of the present century. The spring is now dry, but this fresh water must have been an important element in the earlier importance of the settlement on the island. Another possible former spring may be noted near the NW corer of the fortifications. Traces of an anc. road can be seen running westward from the gate on the N side of the walls of the kastro. This road followed immediately under the walls to a point below the W most point of the kastro. From this location sweeping back to the E, under the SE walls of the kastro are the remains of scores of buildings, presumably a sizeable settlement nestled under, and protected by, the fortifications. Time did not allow us to delimit the boundaries and extent of this settlement, but it must certainly have been large and apparently contemporary with phases 1 and/or 2 of the walls of the kastro. Below the kastro to the S there is a low saddle that has a clear view of the sea, both to the E and to the W (location of the presumed harbour during the Byz age). At the top of this saddle is a small (ca 3 x 5.8m) moder church dedicated to St. John the Theologian. This single-aisled church has a floor made of large ceramic tiles that presumably came from an</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 27 Fig. 25 earlier building. On the surface around the chapel are pieces of pottery dating to the 7th Ct AD along with fragments of marble slabs from an earlier structure. To the N of the modem chapel are traces of walls, and some 13m to the E and on line with the apse of the chapel are remains of an apse with a radius of ca 1.67m. All this evidence suggests that the present chapel was constructed on the remains of a much larger earlier 3-aisled basilica, presumably dated to the 7th Ct AD. On the basis of the surviving walls the nave of this basilica may be restored with a width of 9.00m and a length of 18.63m (excluding the apse). To the W there must have been an atrium, although its length cannot presently be determined. The discovery of this earlier basilica is of considerable importance because it may well have been the resting place of the remains of the Spanish martyrs Valerius, Vincent, and Eulalia mentioned by Paul of Monemvasia. Obviously such an identification cannot be proven on the basis of the present evidence. Indeed, the suggested reconstruction of the basilica is only hypothetical and based on fragments of walls that are visible above the present surface. The fragments of white and green marble found on the site, however, strongly suggest the existence of a monumental building in the immediately vicinity. A project of minor cleaning of the remains of this building, however, would almost certainly provide clear evidence on the size and shape of the EByz building and hopefully answer the question of its connection with the remains of the Spanish martyrs. This is a question of consider- able historical importance and one that will provide significant information about connections between Spain and Greece at the beginning of the Middle Ages." Ermione. At the site of Ag. Andreas, at the foot of the Pronos hill, part of the cemetery of the anc. city was excavated, in the same area where A. Philadelpheus had made similar finds (PAE 1909, 180-2). Six funerary periboloi were built on either side of a road running E-W, four to the S and two to the N of it. Most of the tombs were cists and they ranged in date from G to R times (mostly C-R). Finally, at the OTE plot, in the modem city, to the W of the harbour, were excavated two stepped R funeral monuments, one in marble, the other in limestone. (ADelt 104-6) Heraion. A rock cut LH tomb was discovered ca 97m from the N fence of the anc. site, on the road to the anc. cemetery of Vraserka. There was only one offering, a pot, and the skeleton was in a contracted position. (ADelt 104) Midea. Dr K. Demakopoulou reports on work in 1996: "In 1996 excavations continued in the interior of the Acropolis of Midea under the direction of Dr Katie Demakopoulou in collaboration with Paul Astr6m, Gisela Walberg and Nikoletta Valakou. The excavations were conducted in three sectors: in the E gate area, on the lower terraces of the NE part of the acropolis and in the W gate area. The results of this year's investigations were of great importance, worthy of one of the major Argive Mycenaean centres like Midea. In the W gate area, excavation continued at the building complex, which was uncovered in the previous years parallel to the fortification wall (Fig. 25). The investigation of the build- ing's largest room, room VI, which was uncovered in 1995, was completed with the removal of a ruined wall which was built on the debris of the building, apparently soon after its destruction. The excavation here yielded several intact Myc vases: jugs, straight-sided alabastron and feeding bottle, and an abundance of sherds of the LH IIIB2 period, as well as a lot of stone tools: pounders, obsidian and flint blades, fresco frag- ments and a large piece of an antler. Next to the large room, towards the W at a lower level, another room, room VII, of smaller dimensions was revealed. It contained plenty of vases in situ, mostly pithoi, which were lot of pottery, both plain and decorated, of the LH IIIB2 period, such as narrow-necked jugs, alabastra, basins, kylikes, cups, mugs and handmade miniature vases (Fig. 26). The room also contained other storage and cooking vessels, a lot of stone tools (pounders and millstones), as well as many spindle whorls of clay and steatite. The most important find in this area was an</page><page sequence="28">28 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 26 Fig. 28 Fig. 29 Fig. 27 intact stone tripod mortar, which is preserved in perfect con- dition (Fig. 27). To the N of the rooms, a complex of walls was uncovered, the excavation of which will be completed in the next season. The deposits in this area contained, apart from abundant pottery dated also to LH IIIB2, a lot of fresco fragments with well preserved colours and a terracotta animal figurine." G. Walberg reports on the 1996 excavations on the Lower Terraces: "During the 1996 season, we were able to trace the S wall of the megaron for 7m W of the platform found outside the megaron in 1994. Beyond that point it was much destroyed by later occupation. Originally it must have joined a wide N-S wall built of large blocks 30m from the back wall of the megaron and of the same construction. The N wall of the megaron was traced for some metres to the W, but it was not yet possible to trace it to the N-S wall where the S megaron wall must have ended. It is thus obvious that the megaron forms the centre of a larger complex or quartier (Fig. 28). In room VII, N of the megaron, two more sealings were found in addition to the one found in 1991 (Kadmos, XXXI, 1992). One of the new nodules has three Linear B syllabograms, pa-zo-jo, representing a name in the genitive (Fig. 29). The second nodule has the impression of a (much earlier) Cut Style seal with a goat motif. The motif is, however, different from the goat motif on the Cut Style seal found inside the megaron in 1994. Among the finds from room VII was also an amber bead. FN sherds and the rim of an EH (3rd millennium) sauceboat added to the evidence for early habitation on the acropolis. Excavations N of the N wall of the megaron revealed a short wall built in LH IIIC to shore up the megaron after the LH IIIB earthquake. A fine white plaster floor in room XV also belongs to the LH IIIC phase. A nearby cutting in the bedrock contained much MH and LH I-II pottery and a bronze necklace with a circular pendant and two glass beads. Parallels have been found in LH I tombs at Argos and Tiryns. West of the point where the S megaron wall was destroyed, a room (XVIII) was found, measuring 4 x 3.20m. The S part of the room contained a LH IIIB bench and, next to it, a shaft surrounded on four sides by parapet walls (Fig. 30). The shaft contained MH to LH IIIC pottery. All phases between MH II and LH IIIC seem to be represented. Among the finds from the LH IIIB level was a small, fragmentary terracotta snake. North of the bench at a lower level were a N-S and an E-W wall forming a corer. A floor with pottery from the transition of the MBA to the LBA (MH-LH IIA pottery) abutted these walls. The walls and the floor surrounded the opening of a cistern. The walls of the cistern were not coated with plaster, but the rock itself is hard enough to contain water. This is an important find in view of the scarcity of stratified MH III-LH I-II settlement material. The pottery which includes Mainland</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 30 Fig. 31 Polychrome, White on Dark Burnished and LH I-II fabrics of MBA and early LBA type is contemporary with the finds from the base of the Cyclopean wall found in 1995, which was cut through by the S megaron wall. A long, narrow entrance passage to room XVIII, reused during the R period for storage, contained pithoi, an early Myc ivory sword pommel (the fourth sword pommel found within the megaron complex) and fragments of painted wall-plaster (bands in blue, red and yellow). In nearby room XX, a semicircular-circular foundation, possibly an altar, was found in a LH IIIB stratum. A rhyton, spouted bowls, figurines and some miniature vessels were among the finds in the room and suggest (together with the terracotta snake in the room with the shaft) that cult activities, perhaps connected with water, may have taken place in the area. In the S part of the room was a water channel which presumably once fed the cistern with water from the upper part of the acropolis. The find of the shaft and these channels has given us at least a partial answer to the question of how the supply and storage of water was organized within the citadel. Unfortunately lack of time and the amount of pottery found in the shaft prevented us from excavating more than a small part of the channel during the 1996 season." Synoro Malandreniou. Remains of an EHL workshop were excavated at the Soteropoulos plot, part of an anc. settlement established as early as the 6th Ct BC, on the N bank of the Inachos river. (ADelt 104) ARKADIA No report for 1991 was submitted to ADelt 46 by the 5th PR &amp; C Ephorate. Agiorgitika Mantineias. Theodore and George Spyropoulos report: "A large metallurgical kiln has been excavated at the site of Sallou, Alemis' plot, just above the village (Fig. 31: view from the SW). The apex of the kiln has collapsed; its lower part, preserved to a height of 1.90m, is made of big, roughly cut stones, which form a circle (diam. 9.5m), the inner face of which is covered with a thick layer of mud, to protect it from the heat of the fire of the smelting furnace. The door in front was used for the filling and the cleaning of the kiln. Among the ashes and carbonized wood inside the kiln, some samples of lumps (scoriae) were picked up, which will be examined in the BSA Fitch Laboratory. In the immediate vicinity of the huge kiln some associated installations were unearthed which were annexed to it and served the treating and washing of the ore. They are well dated to the EH II-MH I period (ca 2500-1750 BC), when the operation was violently stopped and the site remained deserted until the Byz period. The installation, with well-preserved remains of intense metallurgical activity (bronze ?), covers several acres and pro- vides evidence of an unknown metallurgical centre of early Greek prehistory. The authors attribute this activity to the Minyans, who are famous for their technological achievements in several fields (draining of lakes and marshes, overseas exploits, etc)." Asea Valley Survey. Dr Jeannette Forsen (Swedish Institute) reports on the preliminary results of 1995-96: "During the second field season in 1995, an area of llkm2was intensively surveyed in the Asea Valley, centering on and around the Alpheios river. The ground covered stretched from the sources of Frangovrysi in the E to the village of Marmaria in the W and included the previously excavated site Asea Paleokastro (Fig. 32). In the SW part of the valley at the NE foot of the Tsemberou range there used to be a large lake, which however has dried up completely since the 1950s. Around this former lake and the Fig. 32 29</page><page sequence="30">30 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 33 Alpheios river, the soil consists of recent, archae-ologically sterile alluvium. Not far from these recent alluvia, we found a couple of LPal or Mes sites with large quantities of chipped stones of chert, flint and quartz. A couple of sites were also discovered of N and Myc date. The only EH and MH pottery found in 1995 came from the acropolis (240 x 120m) in Kato Asea around which we also have MN finds indicating that the prehistoric settlement occupies a fairly large area also below the acropolis itself. A completely new picture of the 'lower town' at Asea Paleokastro was given by the abundant remains of A, C and HL pottery all around the acropolis except in the NW, where fields were left fallow and the ground was therefore invisible. Very near the acropolis, just to the N, we found within a limited area in some ploughed fields, abundant A to HL tableware, miniature vessels, terracotta figurines, a bronze handle (Fig. 33) and some iron tools. This is to be interpreted as a cult-place, belonging to the polis of Asea. Throughout the survey area of 1995 we found a lot of smaller sites, dating from the A to the HL period. These sites have probably been farmsteads and in some cases perhaps even small villages, surrounding the polis of Asea. In the modem village of Athenaion we came across one architectural block, clearly not in situ, which originates from a public building in Doric order of the mid-4th Ct BC (perhaps from the Athena temple mentioned by Pausanias as located in this general area, but not yet found). The geological work was intensified in 1995, and more soil samples were taken, for determining the soil type, grain size, phosphate content and pH. The last field campaign of the Asea Valley Survey project was carried out in 1996. Two teams, each made up of five walkers, covered roughly 12km2of terrain in the W and S part of the valley. The survey finds from the 1996 season stretch in date from the N, or even earlier, to the Med period. A couple of R villas, of which one also had its own pottery kiln, were found located along the former shorelines of the dried out lake close to the Tsemberou range. Several farmsteads of A to HL date were identified by sherds and/or painted tiles, and towards the N of the modem village of Lianos we believe that we have managed to trace the N bound- aries of the polis centre of Eutaia. In the pass through the Tsemberou mountain, leading from the Asea valley into the Megalopolis valley, and above the remains of a Frankish tower near Paparis, we located an anc. sanctuary. Among the Med sites found this season the most conspicuous was identified around Agia Triada of Paparis. This is the largest Med village found in the area covered by the Asea Valley Survey. Part of this village even seems to have been fortified. Concurrent with the intensive survey the geologist con- tinued his geomorphological study of the valley. During this work he made ca 30 augering holes, to a maximum depth of 5.2m, in the alluvial area around the river Alpheios E of the Paleokastro of Asea. In most holes he found a thick cultural layer at a depth of 2-3m, which contained very small and undiagnostic bg sherds. In some holes a second, and sometimes even a third, cultural layer was found at a depth of 4-5m, clearly separated from the first cultural layer by a sterile alluvial layer. The first cultural layer is probably to be con- sidered as part of the A-HL polis centre of Asea." Eva. Theodore and George Spyropoulos continued excavation of the villa of Herodes Atticus; they report: "A general view of the central core of the villa, taken from the SW (Fig. 34), shows how it was adapted to the landscape configurations. The atrium, rectangular in shape, occupies the centre of the villa and is surrounded by a deep channel, an arti- ficial river, imitating the Canopus of the Nile and of the Villa Hadriana of Tivoli. Three sides of the atrium were expanded to stoas decorated with mosaic pavements, while the W side was occupied by a nymphaion and an exedra erected above it. In the background of Fig. 34, the ruins of Herodes Atticus' Palace or Basilica are visible. An important find in the N stoa of the villa was a tondo in pentelic marble depicting a couple (Fig. 35). On a high pedestal in the right background stands a naked male figure holding a club, and on a rocky spur in the left foreground Herakles is seated in 3 view with the lion skin tied around his neck and stretched out behind his body and over the rocky seat. His bow and quiver are placed at the left edge of the relief. Opposite him a young girl is depicted half-nude, looking at him and at the same time trying to free herself from his erotic embrace. The subject matter is well known from representations on mirrors or ivory lids dating to the late 4th Ct BC. We have here an episode of the love story between Herakles and avge, the princess of Tegea. The Lysippian modelling of Herakles' body and the Praxitelian grace of the girl point to an eclectic composition of the 2nd Ct AD. Also from the N stoa is a mosaic pavement representing a hunting scene (Fig. 36). An enormous beast in gray-green colour, presumably an elephant, occupies the foreground. The Fig. 34</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 35 Fig. 36 figures, in almost paratactic procession, are easily identifiable from the preserved inscriptions. The first figure represented seated on horseback is identified as Dido, accompanied by a servant in the middle, while the third figure is Aeneas himself. At the left end of the scene is represented a building with arches and pilasters, probably a hunting pavilion. The mosaic is of excellent quality in opus tessellatum. The design is composed of two elements: a central panel and a varying number of bordering bands which serve as a frame for the central 'carpet,' setting it off from the rest of the pavement. The subject matter of the pavements falls into the category of mythological scenes and represents the well known myth, as illustrated in Aeneid IV by Virgil; according to the myth a hunt was organized by Juno and Venus aimed at bringing together the hero and heroine. The sweetness of expression of the figures and the deeper almond eyes offer particular visual and tactile gratification to the viewer. A mosaic pavement from the S stoa represents the well- known sculptural group of Achilles and Penthesileia, the queen of the Amazons (Fig. 37). The mosaic pavement is executed in opus tessellatum technique. As with the previous mosaic composition, the geometric patterns are endlessly repeated in a continuous tapestry-like surface which imitates the carpets which cover the corridors of houses from HL Delos to GrR Pompeii and Sparta. The most frequent pattern appearing on all the mosaic pavements, including this one, is the wave. Particularly striking is the effect of polychromy, which is often used to give the appearance of a relief. The coral of the face, the drawing of the eye-brows and the arch of the hairline are discreetly used to heighten effect, while on the other hand the aggressive imitation of painting has subsided in favour of a more measured attitude. A marble torso of Achilles was found in the W trench of the villa during the systematic excavations of 1995 (Fig. 38). The torso, found headless, formed part of a sculptural group-the renowned Achilles and Penthesileia group. The torso is executed in a powerful baroque, muscled style, and is heavily proportioned with wide shoulders. The position of the body and the strong diagonal emphasis created by the baldric confer structural length. The group probably stood at the W end of the S stoa, since a semi-circular pedestal, which fits accurately the base of the group, is visible there." Lousoi. Veronica Mitsopoulou-Leon reports on the work of the avstrian Institute in 1996: "After the completion last year of excavations inside and in the close surroundings of the temple, an extension of the excavation area towards the E was found necessary. About 14m E of the temple, remains of a P-shaped building were discovered, oriented on the axes of the temple, and with its S side on the same line as the S limit of the temple. The foundations measure about 7m N-S; their present excavated width is ca 2.50m, but they continue towards the E. The building was erected on the rock, which slopes steeply from S to N. To even out the difference in height, the rock was cut away to the S. Towards the N the foundations reach a height of 1.20m. To strengthen the SW corer, large blocks of rock were laid, and above them, rubble set in clay formed the bedding for limestone slabs. Some of these are preserved in situ, others have fallen; they formed the walls of the building, which were only ca 38cm wide. The building has not yet been fully excavated, so nothing can yet be said about its function or its relation to the temple or sanctuary. North of the P-shaped building extend untouched layers, or earth covered by the debris of the old excavations. One of them produced a large number of finds: sherds, metal objects and fragments of clay statuettes, dating from the 8th to 6th Ct BC. According to our present knowledge, this is a levelling stratum, containing votives of the earlier temple phase, which was created by later extensions or building activities to strengthen the plateau. In the W this layer was greatly disturbed by the building phases and use of the later temple, by successive church buildings, a recent cemetery and the robber trenches of treasure hunters. This makes the undisturbed assemblages in the E all the more important, since metal finds from Lousoi have up to now been widely scattered. Certain types appear in the repertoire of Lousoi for the first time. Numerous fragments of broken cult vessels, several 'cult pyxides' with horizontal stripes and vessels with impressed decoration-a type which probably comes from a workshop in N Achaia and dates from the late 8th Ct-are noteworthy among the pottery finds. 31</page><page sequence="32">32 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 37 .:-::.:::-:::::::: ... .... . Among the metal objects, a scarab dating from the late 8th Ct calls for special attention: its rectangular base is pierced in the manner of Laconian votive offerings; between two zigzag bands runs an undulating line. Outside the sealed context lay a rampant bronze lion, which probably comes from a krater or stand, a Laconian piece of the mid 6th Ct (Fig. 39). Terracottas: A fragment came to light which provides the nose and mouth of a protome found last year. It is a very fine piece, showing a long lower face, horizontal lips and hair falling down in pearl-like locks. A single piece of very good quality is a protome ca 11II cm high. Full lips with protruding lower lip, rimmed eyes, jutting nose and a strong chin characterize the face; the broad chin makes it look unwomanly. The hair-style combines two types: the older style is seen in the bunched locks falling behind the left ear, while the wavy hair above the triangular forehead already points to the 6th Ct Se~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - _(Fig. 40). Apart from the excavation, study was continued of building elements during investigation of the layout of the temple area. Although separated from the building, these elements clearly belong to the architecture of the temple. The results of these analyses show that 18 of these blocks were from the wall footing of the naos. Two orthostat blocks could be identified as belonging to the course above the wall footing. Thus, the number of building elements related to the lower part of the naos walling has grown to 20 limestone blocks and forms a representative basis for the reconstruction of this sec- tion of the Temple of Artemis." Fig. 38</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 33 Fig. 39 Mt. Lykaion. Sanctuary of Zeus. D. Romano (ASCS) reports on survey work at the sanctuary in 1996: "With an electronic total station we surveyed all the above ground and visible monuments of the lower sanctuary, as well as the column bases for the golden eagles of Zeus, and associated monuments, near the southern summit of Mt. Lykaion. We keyed our above ground survey into the 1:5000 topographic maps and the grid of the Greek Army Geodetic Survey, and used the visible geodetic monuments that we had in the vicinity as reference points. Our only difficulties were in the areas of some of the architectural remains where there was extremely dense overgrowth (especially at the E end of the stoa and at the W end of the bath facility) which meant that aspects of the once exposed structures could not be accurately surveyed in their entirety. I am now in the process of creating a digital three-dimensional topographical map of the area of the Sanctuary of Zeus which, when completed, will add substantial information to the survey drawings. For the general area of the sanctuary and the ash altar we are digitising on the computer all of the topographical contour lines of the 1:5000 scale map. We were able to locate six of the starting line blocks of the stadium, four of which are found in the interior of the hippo- drome area." Orchomenos. Theodore and George Spyropoulos report: "Situated in the middle of the upper Orchomenian plain is a huge (diam. 20m) round stone heap, known to Pausanias as Zop6o (= heap of stones). Travellers of the 19th Ct (see Frazer, Pausanias's Description of Greece, IV, 1965, 227-8; Dodwell, Tour, 2, 425; Leake, Morea, 3, 100; Curtius, Pelop. I 222) considered it to be an anathema. Its excavation, which is in progress, has revealed an artificially constructed monument, divided into four cross-like branches joining at the centre (Fig. 41); the triangular spaces between them had been filled with stones. The monument was probably surmounted by a stone or a stele, and it is tempting to connect with it a stone menhir allegedly found in the area and referred to by the French archaeologists who investigated Arcadian Orchomenos at the beginning of this century. Pausanias refers to the Soros as a funerary monument, a fact which is being corroborated by the discovery of a burial and other burial pits. The stone tumulus is surrounded by a stone krepis, and auxiliary compartments enhance its monumental Fig. 40 character. The whole complex, unique in Greece, seems to be well dated to EH II, before the middle of the 3rdmillennium BC." Palaiokastro Gortyna. Over 100 tombs have now been excavated in the Myc ChT cemetery. According to the exca- vator, T. Spyropoulos, they date from LH IIB to SMyc. Pits and cists, pit-caves and two rock-cut tombs imitating tholoi have also been cleared. Much of the Myc pottery dates to LH IIIC, Middle and Late. It includes Octopus Style stirrup jars (Fig. 42) and vases decorated in the Pictorial Style (Fig. 43) as well as examples of the four-handled jar (Fig. 44), characteristic of Achaia and Elis. A large hydria contained a cremation burial together with an iron sword. Other non-ceramic artefacts include very large bronze pins and violin bow fibulae and a Naue II sword, an addition to that found by Chr. Christou in his excavations at the site in the 1950s. It is suggested by the excavator that one of the ChTs was used as a late Myc Nekro- manteion (Fig. 45). Two parallel walls have been constructed in the N half of the chamber on a semi-circular bench. Next to the right-hand wall is a huge phallic baetyl. A large opening has been carefully cut in the roof through which liquid offerings Fig. 41</page><page sequence="34">34 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 43 Fig. 42 may have been poured into a semicircular rockcut basin. A cone-shaped hole cut in the roof may have served the same purpose. The walls of the chamber contained deep round crooked holes. (Spyropoulos, 1996, 22-32) Partheni. Susan Petrakis and Christina Salowey report on the first season of the Partheni Topographical Survey in June 1996: "This was a preliminary season and our work therefore concentrated on reconnaissance of sites and anc. remains within topographically defined units in the study area. These units are located on the 1:50,000 and 1:5,000 Greek Army maps. The data gathered from each unit is summarized below. All the units will be the focus of further, more intensive study in 1997. When terrain permitted, we walked measured transects at intervals of 20 to 35m. Structural remains, concentrations of sherds and other apparently cultural features were noted, photographed, and entered on the map. We did not collect finds, but in some cases we photographed and drew profiles of feature sherds and other small finds, leaving them in situ. Areas identified for further study: Agiorgitika: archaeological site located S of the village of Agiorgitika, across from church of Ag. Nikolaos. This is a known site, excavated by Carl Blegen and the University of Cincinnati in 1928. Although it is the subject of a forthcoming intensive study by S. Petrakis, we documented the current state of the mound for the purpose of the survey. Recent ploughing has disturbed the surface and numerous N sherds, stone tools, and fragments of stone walls were noted. Mouchli Valley: at the S end of the Mouchli Valley, an area which runs N-S along the base of the W slope of the peak of Palaio Mouchli, substantial remains of an anc. road bed-of as yet undetermined date-were discovered in a cut bank along with stretches of possible anc. walls. North spur of Sterna Ridge: most of the N spur of the Sterna Ridge (on which the small church of Ag. Panteleimon is situated) was systematically surveyed. On the N slope of this area, just S of the valley trough in which the modem electrical pylons run, an apparent perimeter wall was discovered, Fig. 44</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 35 Fig. 45 Fig. 46 enclosing a low, flat, squarish buried feature, which appears to represent a collapsed structure of some kind. The apparent perimeter wall is constructed mainly of rubble but in places the natural bedrock is incorporated within it, gaps being filled in by ladder work and stacked stones to complete the circuit. No diagnostic sherds of pottery were found in proximity to either structure, with the exception of some roof tile fragments of indeterminate date. Sterna Ridge: this spur of Mt. Partheni overlooks the E end of the broad, agricultural valley of Partheni. On the ridge itself, not far from the abandoned cistern which gives its name ('Daila Sterna') to the ridge, remains of a heavy, anc. wall were found. This measures 3.20 x 0.75m and defines one edge of a large square structure, possibly a tower. This and the wall appear to be of the same style and date, possibly C. Finds from the immediate vicinity of the wall and tower were: a fragmentary, much folded strip of bronze with raised dots, a small obsidian blade fragment, and a yellow glazed bowl fragment. These were drawn, photographed and left in situ. Not far from the possible tower and wall remains were a number of piles of stones or cairns. These are of indeterminate date and occur on the ridge itself as well as on the S slopes of the ridge. Again, no diagnostic sherds of any kind were noted in the vicinity of the cairns. The stone piles are reminiscent of the herms noted by Pausanias (11.38) on the border between the Tegean, Laconian, and Thyrean territory. Our stone piles lie near to the Tegean-Argive border-a geographical fact which may support the identification of these as 'herms' or boundary markers. More intensive study and measurement of these structures is planned for 1997. Approximately half-way down the S slope of the Sterna ridge, situated on one of a series of abandoned agricultural terraces, is a low terrace wall of rough, but closely fitted, polygonal stones. This is 11.66m in length, E to W. At its center, on its top course, is an oblong polygonal block (0.65m high) set upright. The terrace is covered with vegetation, and whatever may have rested on top of the polygonal wall is not visible, but its style of masonry suggests a date of perhaps late C period. To the E and W of the polygonal terrace wall are two walls, oriented N-S, which appear to have formed part of an enclosure for the terrace structure. These are 19.6m long and are built of the same rough but well-fitted polygonal blocks as the terrace. It is possible that these are the remains of a small building set on a terrace and enclosed in a perimeter wall. However, interpretation of these structures requires further study, to be carried out in 1997. Partheni Katavothres: The most significant find of the 1996 survey season was a massive wall, clearly ancient in origin, located just within the entrance of the southernmost of the swallow-holes situated along the base of the W slope of Mt. Parthenion, E of the village of Partheni. These swallow-holes are the outlet from the Partheni basin for the Sarantopotamos river (the anc. Alpheus). The wall runs N-S across the entrance to the katavothra and is preserved to a height of 1.25m. It is built of well-cut and well-fitted ashlar blocks, each ca 0.50 x 0.40m. Preserved on the surface of the top course are cuttings for clamps, some of which retain their original bronze clamps, set into lead. Others have lost their clamps but are still filled with lead. Other circular cuttings with an average diameter of llcm are also preserved on the top surface of the wall. They occur at regular intervals along the length of the wall, and correspond to similar circular cuttings still visible in the vault of the cave's ceiling. The placement of these cuttings suggests that some sort of grate, of wood or bronze-perhaps designed to prevent large pieces of debris from being washed into the swallow-hole and blocking its drainage-was set into the cuttings. The wall is partially obscured by broken concrete slabs from 20th-Ct attempts at debris and water control, as well as by garbage, washed in by the river or dumped by the local inhabitants. This explains why the wall appears to have escaped discovery until now." Sakovouni (Near the village of Kamenitsa). Theodore and George Spyropoulos report: "Situated on the N slope of a conical hill, facing the Aroania mountains, the large settlement of Sakovouni covers two periods: the Neolithic (4500-3000 BC) and the LH (1550-1200 BC). The E part of the Neolithic settlement is enclosed by a wall running along its N border (Fig. 46: in the background remains of a massive enceinte wall are preserved). The E part of the excavated area is the industrial sector of the Neolithic settlement, because here were found masses of obsidian blades and cores, flint and many deer horns fashioned as tools and weapons. The central and E parts of the settlement were occupied by large, rectangular buildings, the residential and cult areas (Fig. 47), their walls preserved to a height of 1.80m. The LH I-IIB2 settlement at Sakovouni was built over the main area of the Neolithic town and contains large rectangular</page><page sequence="36">36 DAVID BLACKMAN G buildings has confirmed that metallurgical activity took place in the sanctuary at this period, and some waste products from pottery production have also been identified in a later context. A program of analysis of pollen samples from stratigraphical contexts is being carried out in collaboration between the Universities of Bergen and Thessalonike, and other specialists are taking care of the skeletal material from the Byz graveyard and the animal bones from all sectors of the sanctuary." Episkopi. Excavations have been conducted by Theodore and George Spyropoulos between 1986-1997 on the site of the anc. agora (Fig. 48: view from the E; in the foreground, the end of the analemma of the theatre, erected in 174 BC). The open area is covered by the remains of a huge ECh Basilica of the 6th Ct AD, whose excavation continues with the financial assistance of the Stasinopoulos-Biohalco Foundation. A substantial part of a HL stoa with a votive of a warship of the Fig. 47 3rd Ct BC is being unearthed, as well as extensive parts of a medieval settlement (7-13th Ct AD). The exterior part of the area of the HL theatre, upon which the Church of the Virgin was erected in the early 10th Ct AD, has also been excavated, forming thus a conspicuous ensemble of various monuments and cultures. A striking new find is a volute crater with rf representation of a young athlete with strigil between two floral motives (Fig. 49). The neck of the crater is decorated with continuous foliage. The vase was restored and completed froti several fragments found in a shallow pit near the so-called Thyrsos Basilica which supposedly took the place of the Temple of Apollo in the agora (430-420 BC).

The settlement is probably identified with the Homeric town Enispe, known from epic (Iliad II) and the tablets of the Myc Palace at Pylos." Tegea. E. Ostby (Norwegian Institute at Athens) reports on 1996 study of material from the sanctuary of Athena Alea: "The second of the two planned study seasons was carried out, and was mostly concerned with the material from the excavation trenches N of the temple. Small amounts of datable material (mostly pottery) from the different layers provide a full stratigraphical framework from the period when the C temple was constructed-certainly not before the 2nd half of -. . , :* the 4th Ct BC-and back to the early 6th or late 7th Ct BC. Earlier layers have not yet been investigated, and the almost total lack of stratigraphical layers and archaeological material from the period between the construction of the temple and its destruction-in the 6th Ct AD, probably by an earthquake- remains to be explained. Cleaning and study of the objects have exposed a couple of short C votive inscriptions, and among the tile fragments a piece of a large, primitive sima, almost certainly from the 7th Ct temple, was identified. Study of the metallurgical waste products, carried out at the Demokritos Laboratory at Athens, from the metal workshop in front of the Fig. 49</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 37 LAKONIA No report for 1991 was submitted to ADelt 46 by the 5th Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate. A useful and comprehen- sive catalogue of the Byz and post-Byz painted churches of Lakonia has been published by M. Drandakis in Lakonikai Spoudai 13 (1996) 167-236. Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). Joost Crouwel and Mieke Prent report on the work of the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute at the acropolis of Geraki: "The 1996 season was for the main part dedicated to completing work started in the previous year: the drawing up of detailed topographical maps, the planning and study of standing remains-in particular the 750m-long wall around the top of the acropolis-and the systematic collection of artefacts on the surface of the acropolis and adjoining slopes (Figs. 50, 51). These aims were achieved, including processing of the numerous finds. In addition, a geophysical survey was carried out, indicating possible archaeological features on the top of the acropolis. A start was made with the recording and study of the spolia incorporated in the various Med and later churches in and around Geraki. Summarising our preliminary results in chronological order: there is substantial evidence, in the form of pottery and obsid- ian, for EH and MH occupation of the summit of the acropolis. Finds high up on the NE slope include pottery with a most unusual surface treatment, consisting of what we have called 'smear marks'; it may date to LN or final N. Striking is the virtual absence of Myc pottery. This makes it improbable that the original, megalithic construction of the acropolis wall belongs to that period, as has sometimes been assumed. After a long gap, activity is again attested by a handful of painted sherds classified as G. A to HL material is widely distributed. Some of it is clearly votive in character. Of note are two joining fragments of a terracotta disc acroterion which would have belonged to an A temple or shrine. Among later material mainstream R and Byz wares are rare. Interesting, though not precisely datable, is the evidence for iron working. This includes slag-cake, deriving from so-called bowl furnaces. As for the spolia, they include fragments of five marble triglyphs belonging to the same Doric building, probably a temple. Although the provenance of these and other building elements cannot be established with certainty, they may come from the temple of Apollo on the acropolis of Geronthrai, mentioned by Pausanias (III, 22, 7). In this connection, two Doric capitals were reported by the early British excavators of Geraki in 1905-one from the acropolis, the other from its E slope. A third such capital has now been recorded in the church of Aghios Sozon." Monemvasia. Under the direction of Dr David Hill of the University of Manchester, the final season of survey was carried out at Monemvasia in co-operation with the 5th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities and Mr Kostas Khoudrou, as part of the general study of Monemvasia undertaken by Dr H. Kalligas. Dr Hill reports: "The six-year programme of survey and recording at the upper city of Monemvasia has now come to a planned end (Fig. 52). The walls have all (upper and lower city) been photographed from the outer face. Detailed survey of these walls and turrets has been carried out, and they have been drawn in plan and in elevation, as have the major structures. A specific project has been the detailed recording of all the main upper city cisterns, such as the aptly named bastada. The priority is to make sure that the archive is safely and efficiently lodged so that we may draw a line under this programme. Clearly the whole of the structures have not been completed but those within the target area are covered. Future plans are under active discussion but an integrated campaign may well be called for, building on the success of the past six years." Pyrgos Dyrou. The church of Agioi Theodoroi, in the Kalou settlement, is a single-aisled, barrel-vaulted building with a single apse for the sanctuary. It is dated to the 12th Ct and is interesting for its brick work decoration, and the use of bowls and relief fragments in the masonry. (ADelt 128) Skoutari (Gytheion). The church of Agia Barbara, although much altered, is listed as a Byz structure (llth Ct?) of the two-column, inscribed cross variety with Athenian dome. Byz frescoes may exist under the present 19th-Ct layer. (ADelt 128) Sparta. Theatre. Prof. G. B. Waywell (BSA) reports on the 1996 study season: "A four-week season of study was carried out in the anc. Theatre of Sparta in 1996, under the joint direction of Prof. G.B. Waywell and Prof. J.J. Wilkes, with the assistance and co-operation of Dr Spyropoulos and his colleagues in the Greek Archaeological Service. The pro- gramme of research consisted of study and scale-drawing of the walls and architecture of the stage building, following seasons of excavation and study in 1992-5. Fig. 53 shows the theatre viewed from the W, with remains of the stage building and the unexcavated area to the W. The scale-planning of the walls of the stage building (at 1:20) was brought to completion. A N-S section was drawn through the stage building, from S of the S wall to N of the front wall of the projecting stage. Detailed analysis and scale-drawing was undertaken of both N and S faces of the N wall of the stage building (at 1:10). Particular attention was devoted to the problems of interpretation posed by the system of construction consisting of piers with intervening in-fill. Research and study conducted in 1996 confirmed the phasing of the stage building advanced following the 1995 season. The programme of architectural block recording was con- tinued, and records of all the significant surviving elements of architecture were completed. Likewise the scale-drawing of the architectural blocks from the scaenae frons, begun in 1995, was brought to completion. A further 70 blocks were drawn, many of them in multiple views, to add to the hundred drawn in 1995. These are final drawings, intended to aid the reconstruction on paper of the scaenae frons in its second R phase, and will be published in the final report. During the winter of 1996/97 the architectural data will be transferred to CAD (Computer Aided Design) files to facilitate computerized reconstruction of the theatre. Further study and photography was undertaken on sculptures from Woodward's excavation of the theatre, now stored in Sparta Museum. Environmental study of faunal remains from the theatre excavations was carried out, concentrating on material from the green silt layer over the orchestra. Dr Graham Chandler of the BSA Fitch Laboratory came to examine the contexts of the mortar samples taken from different parts of the structure of the theatre in 1995. Preliminary examination suggests that the aggregates used in the mortar are likely to be from a local source, but further research is required.</page><page sequence="38">38 DAVID BLACKMAN GERAKI 1996 0 50 100 150 I I LEGENDA modem road acropolis wall * terrace or field walls -....... . -.... - contours (5 m.) - - - property boundaries F,D-,o-o I%Or,vOr A natural boundaries modern village isolated modem building almond grave top of hill Fig. 50 </page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 39 Fig. 51 Fig. 54 Fig. 52 Fig. 55 Fig. 53 We illustrate a section of the LR fortification to the W of the stage building, with architectural spolia from the scaenaefrons built in (Fig. 54); a ceiling block with rosette from the porch of the stage faqade (Fig. 55); a moulded plinth from a pier supporting the E porch of the Flavian stage building (Fig. 56); complete cornice blocks from lower (right) and upper storeys of the Flavian stage building (Fig. 57); and Doric column shafts from the colonnade around the top of the theatre (Fig. 58).

Traces of wall painting and marble revetments were found on the interior walls, while the original main altar and that in the prothesis are in situ. The north side of the build- ing preserves traces of some kind of stoa. Cist graves with very few offerings were found all around the excavation, both inside and outside the church. Finds included glazed pottery, marble epistyle fragments, small bronze objects and coins. A MByz date is likely, with use extending to the end of the 12th Ct. The church is of immense importance for an understanding of the Med city of Lakedaemonia. (ADelt 116-17) Sparta. Magoula. Rescue excavations here (near the Sparta acropolis) uncovered part of a cemetery and architectural remains from various phases difficult to identify or distinguish. The S and W part of the excavated area contained 33 graves oriented E-W and arranged in four rows. Cist and pit graves included a fine cist grave of the 4th Ct AD (coin of Valentinian I,AD 364-375). Some graves were opened into the fabric of old architectural remains. A large number of pit graves were reused. Coin finds included issues of Michael VII (1071-1078) and Manuel I (1148-1180). Of the 12 coins found on the entire excavated site, 5 date to the 10-12th Ct. Small finds included bronze ornaments (earrings, a bracelet), glass and bone beads, wall painting fragments. A small apsidal structure with large interior piers presented problems of interpretation due to the poor state of preservation. (ADelt 128-9) Sparta area. Geomorphological survey. Keith Wilkinson (BSA) reports on the 1996 season: "A two-week season of study was undertaken in 1996. The major objective of the three-year project is to reconstruct the landscape history of the Evrotas valley around Sparta for chronological periods in which humans have occupied it (Pal to present). The aim of the 1996 field season was to assess the types of deposits present in the area, and their probable dates, to determine which survey techniques are most appropriate, and to collect samples for trial laboratory analysis, again to see which are most likely to produce the most informative results. The 1996 survey was conducted by walking radiating transects of the Evrotas valley centred on the town of Sparta. Sedimentary strata and geomorphological features were recorded along the route of each transect using stratigraphic logs and notebook descriptions. The following transects were walked: Sparta NW to Karavas: this route follows the E side of the 'Neogene' excarpment of which the Sparta acropolis hill is a S outlier. This feature is considered to be of Pliocene date by most authors, but van Berghem and Fiselier, in the soon to be published Laconia Survey volume, suggest that it is in fact part of the middle glacis, equating with Vita Finzi's Pleistocene 'Older Fill.' Therefore these sediments may have been accumulating during the Pal period. Within one section exposed in a road cutting near the Evrotas bridge a palaeo- channel was found filled with material of an entirely different</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 nature. This is likely to be a previous Pleistocene course of the Mougla Torrent, and was filled with organic/manganese-rich sediments. These have been sampled for palynological and sedimentological analysis. A much later feature was noted near Karavas, where a building of R or Byz date was found eroding out of colluvial material 500m S of the village. This building was made of brick and had an opus signinum floor. Sparta ENE towards Chrysapha: further glacis sediments are mapped in this area, which extends into that covered by the Laconia Survey. Extensive (?)colluvial fan deposits of over 4m thickness were noted in isolated pockets amongst the olive terraces around the tip. It is likely that these deposits are of great antiquity, and are possibly even associated with the 'Older Fill' of Vita Finzi. Sparta W towards Mystras: the sediments of this whole route are obscured by the intense agricultural activity that has taken place and no sections could be observed. Sparta S to Amyklai: Amyklai stands on a further Neogene outlier, again assumed to be of the middle glacis (Pleistocene date). 200m W of the archaeological site a gravel deposit was noted with lenticular sand beds. Palaeocurrent measurements indicate that these gravels demonstrate the passage of water in a SW direction. This is no doubt a previous (Pleistocene-early Holocene) course of the Evrotas which passed at this time to the W of Amyklai rather than to the E as now. Sparta town: an extensive survey was carried out of deposits exposed in section within the town of Sparta. Of particular note are the thick gravel beds immediately to the W of the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia and near the municipal pool. These appear to be river terrace remnants with a flow direction comparable to that noted in 4. Elsewhere in the town Neogene rythmites were noted, and capped by both pellet gravels (Pleistocene fluvial deposits) and colluvium (Holocene). The topmost horizons of the colluvium contained R artefacts." ACHAIA The topographical survey of anc. Achaia, conducted by the 6th Ephorate and the National Research Foundation, located a series of anc. sites, mostly R farms or small settlements in the area around Patras (Ag. Georgios at Kato Samakia, Ag. Theodoroi at Kato Kastritsi, Spelia at Charadro Patron, Delta at Platani, Pyrgos at Drepano, Ag. Georgios Chalandritsas at Phares, Salmeniko in Aigialeia province). Part of a C and HL rural shrine was identified at the site of Roupakia (Sella) and part of an arched subterranean drainpipe of the R period, leading to the reservoir, near the E gate of Patras castle, was discovered at the site of Koukaki. At Keryneia, the hill of Ag. Georgios was identified with the acropolis of anc. Elike and was associated with Myc fortifications. The Myc cemetery was probably located at the site of Psoriarou, while various small Myc settlements were scattered in the vicinity. Finally, another Myc ChT cemetery was tentatively identified at the site of Koutsouro and Soulele. (ADelt 153-7) Aigeira. The work of the avstrian Institute continued in 1996 under the direction of Dr A. Bammer, who reports: "As instructed by the Directorate of Antiquities and the Department of Anastilosis, a protective structure was erected over the naiskoi D and E west of the theatre. The structure consists of reinforced concrete supports faced with poros stone, a steel construction covered in galvanized zinc and a translucent plastic skin forming the roof. Work on both temple foundations close to the Tsaoussis house was completed and, in the E, extended to the area in front. The parallel HL buildings excavated in recent years are Hippodamian and oriented towards the E, i.e. in the direction of the Gulf of Corinth; the Peripteros, the so-called building II, lies to the S, while the Building of the Antae, the so-called building I, lies to the N. During excavations in 1996 the following observations were made: the heavy end blocks of conglomerate belonging to the foundations of the Antae Building have been bedded at a deeper level and lie under the sandstone blocks. This technique was used to prevent uneven settling of the building elements, which were of different size. The E area in front of the sanctuary was closed towards the E by a terrace wall of orthostats; its floor was paved with pebbles. A rectangular base with three holes for countersunk rings cut in the upper surface points to sacrificial animals being tied up here. In this area larger HL architectural elements, for instance a block from the tympanon and another from the frieze with metope and triglyph, were recovered. In addition, the lower part of a female draped statue was found. It is not clear whether this belonged to the architectural sculpture, i.e. serving as pediment sculpture or akroterion. The flat back of the figure supports the first view. Last year the recording of the water supply system of the town was continued, a project which had started several years before. The ground-plan of the aqueduct was surveyed and a sketch of the water conduit, visible by the road to Vlovaka, recorded. In addition, the conduit leading from the aqueduct to the town was surveyed in two places: along the hill of Palaiologos and the part which is preserved as a tunnel underneath the asphalt road. The conduit consists partly of clay pipes with a square profile. At the same time the ethno-archaeological survey continued in the area of Palaiokastro. The houses of the raisin pickers, which are about 100 years old, lie mainly along one road; they are mostly built of spolia from the anc. city, which was used like a large stone quarry." Aigion. A considerable number of HL and R buildings were reported in the modem town of Aigion, including a section of a mosaic floor (Odos Omagyriou Dios 12) and parts of cisterns (Odos Romaniole 60, Odos Perikleous and A. Photila). It seems that part of the area of the HL and R town was later (in R times) used as a burial ground. The find of a LR kernos at the junction of Odos Perikleous and A. Photila, with the inscription: AopKivaS Eiat&amp; A&amp;tbov, implies the existence of a cult of Isis in the area. (ADelt 148-50) Ano Akrata. A number of R tombs (2nd-3rd Ct AD), dis- covered within the public forest area, probably belong to a farm or small settlement, between Ano Akrata and Ambelos (probably Anc. Aigai). (ADelt 153) Chalandritsa Patron. One more ChT was excavated at the Myc cemetery of Ag Vasileios Chalandritsas (Tomb 24). It was provided with a rectangular chamber and a few offerings, including 17 pots, a clay whorl and a bronze ring. (ADelt 147) Elaionas. A looted Myc ChT was located 500m to the N of the junction of the old Nat. Road to Mamousia, which suggests the existence of a new Myc cemetery in the area. (ADelt 152) 41</page><page sequence="42">42 DAVID BLACKMAN Elike. Research was conducted by the ASCS under the super- vision of Th. Katsonopoulou, in co-operation with the University of Patras and the 6th Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate. Five bores were drilled 40 to 60m deep. Everywhere the same geological layers were encountered, sand and gravel often alternating with pure sand, mud, mud/sand and clayey mud. More rare were organic layers (mainly in core B1) in- cluding mostly carbonized logs, leaves or branches of trees and plants. The most significant core so far is B2 which at 22-23m depth revealed shells and worked stone. The aim of the present survey was a vertical and horizontal geological section in relation to the sea, down to 40m depth, on the logical assumption that anc. Elike could not be buried deeper than that. Underwater research. In 373 a destructive earthquake and tidal waves submerged anc. Elike, the most important town of Achaia. Five centuries after the destruction, Pausanias visited the area and reported that ruins were still visible in the sea in the area between the rivers Selinous and Kerynites. Byz sources also report submerged ruins. Today nothing is visible on the sea floor or on land. Research between 1950 and 1974 produced no results. In Sept. 1988, an area of sea 8km2in extent was surveyed with sonar, penetrating to a depth of 10-20m, in water depths up to 100m. The results were of great geomorphological interest, but provided no evidence of the existence of the lost city under the sea bed, which probably therefore lies under the coastal plain. The main underwater finds of archaeological interest were: 1. A submerged slope, almost parallel to the coast, over the entire length of the area investigated. A strong earthquake in 1861 caused a subsidence of the coastal plain by ca 2m over a length of ca 13km. The submerged slope could be the former coastline. 2. A linear construction, almost perpendicular to the coast, was located at a depth of 15m W of the Delta of the Vouraikos river, showing impressive similarity to an anc. mole. 3. A massive formation (of a mass of at least 1.000.000m3) lkm NW of the mouth of the Selinous river: this could be either an anc. river bed or a massive discharge of material caused by the destructive phenomenon of 373 BC. 4. Some gigantic 'pockmarks' 1km WNW of the Vouraikos river, the biggest of which are 10m deep with diameter 60m, caused probably by air fluxes resulting from marine subsidence. Land investigation. The negative results of the 1988 under- water investigation led to a search for the location of anc. Elike on land. The first aim of the land campaign was to identify the depth at which the anc. horizon lay with carbon 14 dating and environmental studies. For this reason 5 cores were drilled in 1991 between the rivers Selinous and Vouraikos. The results of both types of investigation were that this area has undergone changes both sudden and gradual: on the one hand, a gradual seaward extension of the land with alluvial deposits from both rivers, and on the other, a sudden break in this process because of the intense earthquake activity in the area, where the sea erodes part of the land and marine sediments are deposited on top of land sediments. The results of the study of the cores suggest that the classical horizon could be searched for at depth of ca 5-12m, depths attainable by geophysical prospection. (ADelt 157-62 &amp; Figs. 8-9) Kalabryta. A survey of chance coin finds in the mountainous area around the old village Drobolobos on the slopes of Mt Erymanthos suggests continued occupation of these areas up to the 7th Ct, and then from the 12th to the 14th. These settle- ments have not yet been substantiated by excavations. (ADelt 175-6) Kallitheokambos. Remains of R buildings of the 1st half of the 1st Ct BC were excavated in the area. (ADelt 147) Kouloura. The area of the worker's housing estate of Ag. Athanasios was apparently a burial ground in the HL period (1 cist tomb, 3 pithos burials with no offerings). (ADelt 151) Patras. A total of 28 rescue excavations were reported for the city of Patras, the majority consisting of HL and R/LR remains of houses, cisterns, public buildings, drainpipes and roads. The funerary remains included parts of the N cemetery of the city at Odos Sarandaporou 52 and at Odos Kolokotrone, where a total of 25 burials were excavated. The burials, dating from the R period, included 11 cists, eight tile roofed tombs, parts of three poros sarcophagi and three funerary urns. Three cists, three tile roofed tombs and two sarcophagi were enclosed within a rectangular peribolos. Parts of two other periboloi with HL sherds in the vicinity were identified at the junction of Odos Strategou Menounou and Pesondon Astynomikon. Part of the S cemetery, located to the SE of the anc. city, including sections of two funerary periboloi, of R date, with a corridor in between, were discovered at Odos Tsertidou 4. Finally, at the junction of Odos Ag. Nikolaou and Kanakare, were excavated a R funeral monument, with a stepped faqade and a subterranean burial chamber, a funerary road to its E and part of a funerary peribolos to its W. Sections of houses, including cisterns and drainpipes, parts of the R city, were excavated all over the moder town and contribute to a wider understanding of the town planning and the extent of anc. Patras. At Odos Ag. Demetriou, the most substantial remains belonged to a R house with an atrium, a mosaic floor and a cistern. The latter was provided with lime- stone platforms at the four comers and with a drainpipe, which started from the SW corer; a group of Dionysus with a young boy, in marble, also probably belonged here. At Odos Votsare 12-4 was excavated part of a very important R building, with a wide entrance and a staircase of five built steps, probably part of the R agora, as well as sections of two roads crossing at right angles. The main road, which ran E-W, was paved with lime- stone slabs and had a pavement along its S side. Finally, parts of heating installations for R baths were discovered at Odos Panachaidos Athenas and at Odos Papadiamandopoulou. In the former was also excavated a section of a sewage drain with an apsidal roof. (ADelt 138-46) Spaliareika Lousikon. Five ChTs were excavated in the Myc cemetery, which was identified in 1990, on the E slope of a low hill, after reports of illegal excavations. All the tombs were oriented E-W with the entrance to the E. Three of the tombs had been looted, one in antiquity. Of the two undisturbed examples, one, with a rectangular chamber but no dromos, con- tained a considerable number of non-pottery finds, especially beads of carnelian, rock crystal, steatite and faience; an unguent vase, dated to 1350-1200 BC, was a Syrian/Egyptian import. (ADelt 147-8) Voudeni. Seven more ChTs were excavated in the Myc cemetery, all oriented N-S, with the chamber opening to the S. Two of the chambers were circular in plan, two rectangular, two oval and one was unfinished; three tombs had burial pits inside the chamber. The burials were both contracted and</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 extended, while the offerings consisted mostly of pottery (SJs). Two tombs (nos 16 and 19) also contained three sealstones and bronze weapons and tools. The tombs range in date between LH IIIA-C. (ADelt 146-7) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA Chalkis. S0ren Dietz (Danish Institute) and Lazaros Kolonas and Yiannis Moschos (6th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities) report on Greek/Danish surveys and excavations: "In 1996, the Danish Institute at Athens and Danish National Museum in co-operation with the Patras ephorate conducted excavations at the mound of Agia Triada to the E of the present- day village of Kato Vasiliki. The site is suggested to contain the remnants of the anc. harbour site of Chalkis in Aitolia mentioned by Homer, Thucydides, Strabon and others. In addition the S part of a tableland called Pangali or Kastro, on the E slopes of mount Varassova, E of Kato Vasiliki, was cleaned and a trial trench was dug in a FN site discovered in 1994. The acropolis of Agia Triada was surrounded by a Byz defence wall. An ECh, three-aisled basilika, on top of the mound, was previously excavated and restored by Professor A. Paliouras, of Ioannina. The excavation concentrated on the NW part of the acropolis inside the Byz wall. On the terrace below the acropolis, a large part of a substantial cofferwork of LC date was uncovered and studied. In the same area deposits and walls from A and C times were revealed. In parts the Byz wall evidently rested on a 5th-Ct (or earlier ?) ashlar construction. A stratum of LH I date was found resting on the bedrock in the trench on the acropolis. This layer was overlaid by a mixed stratum with Myc to A material and, higher up, C, HL and Byz mixed levels. On the acropolis and in the E trenches HL and A constructions and deposits were uncovered. In date the surface material ranges from EH to HL, including MH, Myc and LG materials. The trial trench on the E slopes of Varassova contained rich FN material of pottery, bones, shells, flint and obsidian. During the campaign in 1994 both areas were surveyed systematically. The walls of the Pangali/Kastro fortification were measured and a plan of all structures visible on the surface at Agia Triada was produced." Kainourgio. A double cist tomb of HL date was discovered at the site of Binovryse. (ADelt 164) Naupaktos. A section of the walls of the anc. city was discovered at Odos Lokron, running E-W, and built in the pseudo-isodomic rectangular style. In the same area were revealed houses of the C and HL periods. Remains of a HL house were excavated at Odos Pharmake, while part of the R cemetery of Naupaktos, extending under the S part of the modem city, was investigated at Demotike Odos (five cists without offerings). (ADelt 166-7) Oeniadae. Lazaros Kolonas reports on investigation of the shipsheds, one of the most important monuments of anc. Oeniadae: "The shipsheds at Oeniadae stand out as one of the most important nautical works of antiquity. The earliest work in anc. Oeniadae was carried out by B. Powell in 1900. Besides his research in the theatre, the building on the hill and the baths, Powell excavated a T-shaped trench in the shipsheds of the anc. Fig. 59 Fig. 60 city. Further research, carried out by Lazaros Kolonas in the years 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1995 has fully uncovered the complex of shipsheds and has brought to light new evidence concerning their building, use, architectural layout and their final abandonment. The complex of shipsheds, located at the SW of the anc. city, had the form of a large quadrangular space cut into the rock cliff, measuring 47 x 41m. This cutting opens towards the W, where the six entrances were located, one entrance for each of the ramps on which the ships were slid into and out of the building. In the space between the ramps the rectangular bases were preserved of the five rows of columns supporting one gable roof above each ramp (Figs. 59, 60). The shipsheds were probably destroyed by Philip V during the siege of the city in 219 BC. During the R period (1st Ct AD) the area was used for burials. At the N side, part of the northernmost ramp was partitioned off from the rest of the building, using architectural material taken from the entrances, thus creating a small shipshed, which Powell had originally identified as a store- room." (see also ADelt 164-6) Anc. Stratos. Excavations were continued in the area of the agora, where the N-S walls, dividing the upper and lower 43</page><page sequence="44">44 DAVID BLACKMAN sections of the market, were located, with a 5m wide road between. Other features of the agora excavated in 1991 include the N-S stylobate, the E limit of the agora, with the cuttings for the Doric column bases; a n-shaped exedra, adjoining it to the W; a later stylobate with a built platform at its NE comer, to the N; as well as a fountain house, by the SE entrance to the city. At the N end of the agora was located the bouleuterion build- ing, while excavations were continued in the anc. theatre, revealing further sections of the cavea and the orchestra. A systematic surface survey was conducted of ca 130 stremmata (over 40 acres) of land surrounding the city of Stratos, in co-operation with the German Archaeological Institute and the Universities of Freiburg, Munster and Heidelberg. The results confirm the continuous habitation of the area from ancient times down to the 19th Ct AD. Remains of an anc. temple were located on a natural terrace to the S of Lepeno village, while the remains of another place of worship were discovered near the SW corer of the fortifications of the anc. city, at the site of Grana, possibly of HL date. Most important is the discovery of the anc. quarry, including a destroyed lime kiln and outbuildings, in the foothills of Mt Charvati, 1,5km from anc. Stratos. A rock-cut tomb of the HL period, part of the known cemetery of anc. Stratos, was excavated near the church of the modem village. (ADelt 162-3) Thermon. I. Papapostolou reports on the work of the AS (Ergon 1996, 57-62). Excavations continued in order to establish whether the elliptical peristasis of wooden columns must be connected with megaron B. The excavator's opinion with regard to this connection has long been negative: by the time the peristasis was erected, the megaron had already been destroyed. Specifically, the 1996 excavation shows that the W column-bases are situated higher than the earthfill which covers the megaron. Consequently, the attractive theory that megaron B at Thermon was the predecessor of the peristyle temple now loses its validity. Megaron B dates from the EIA and belongs to the cultural sphere of Epirus and W Macedonia. The W side of the megaron and the earthfill were investi- gated. A hearth-used while the megaron was in use-served heating, cooking and sacrificial purposes. Traces of floor paving help the completion of the temple's ground-plan. The A temple of Apollo was thought by the original excava- tors to be 'sitting' on a layer rich in sacrificial remains. It is now realized that it sat on terrain artificially levelled with earth brought from elsewhere. This earth contained carbonized material and ashes. Sacrificial ashes have, on the other hand, been verified inside and above the ruins of megaron B. The restoration of statue bases and exedrae situated in the Aetolian Agora is another project now under way. As an example of the nature of the monuments we note the exedra with statues, built by the Aetolian League to honour the Egyptian king Ptolemy III Euergetes and his family. KEPHALLENIA A number of anc. remains have been identified on the island, including a small Myc ChT at the site of Litharia, a row of pit graves at the foot of Gioulake hill, part of the R cemetery of the settlement located at the mouth of the nearby stream, a section of a C/HL rectangular tower at the site of Vourtepse, near the modem village of Skala, part of the walls of the acropolis of anc. Pronnai, HL pit graves 300m W/NW of the known Myc cemetery of Mazarakata, and more pit graves in the area between the sites of Dara and Kaminia. (ADelt 167-9) Same. Four more buildings were identified at the site of Karavostasi, near Drakopoulata village (Ag. Euphimia), between the latter and the site of Kardara. Further investiga- tions in the so called 'castle' suggest that it was a tripartite rec- tangular building, while parts of other walls were located in the vicinity. Remains of another tripartite building were discovered 150-200m from the 'castle', as well as two smaller buildings at the N foot of Merovigli hill. Part of the foundations of a rectangular stone building, possibly a farm, were discovered at the site of Peleketa Litharia (Chaliotata), while a similar building was found at the site of Steroules. (ADelt 169) ELEIA Agia Triada. The excavation of this ChT cemetery continued (AR 1995-96, 16) with the clearing of four more tombs (numbers 12-16), all of which are described as 'robbed'. From Ts 12 and 13, which interconnected, came a number of boars' tusks of the familiar type for helmets, as well as pottery, two sard beads and a steatite whorl. Ts 14 and 15 produced only a part of a bronze dagger. (ADelt 133) Further details of more recent work are given by Xeni Arapoyianni of the 7th Ephorate, writing in Kathimerini. So far 40 ChTs of LH IIIA-C date have been excavated. The tombs are strung out E to W with dromoi to the N. The Ts are described as 'mostly unrobbed', and a total of 400 pottery and 1,100 small finds is reported. Among these, four seal rings and eight seal stones are noted as well as gold jewellery. Kaphkania. Noted last year (AR 1995-96, 18), the Linear B inscription found here on a stone continues to arouse interest in the press. The excavator Xeni Arapoyianni has described her excavations in Kathimerini: "The excavation of a low mound with the toponym 'Agrilitses' at Kaphkania, a few km north of Olympia, took a few days in April 1994, with important results. Just under the surface were uncovered the remains of a prehistoric building, of which the two surviving walls were built from unworked stones, of medium size, without binding material. The largest surviving height was 40cm. The floor, largely destroyed, was strewn with semi-worked flat stones. The building was destroyed by fire, shown by the thick layer of ash. The ceramic, also burned, belongs purely to the MH III period, showing that there was only a single occupation phase which after its destruction was covered and never reused. Aside from the pottery, stone tools were also collected (a spindle, two chisels, a grindstone, obsidian blades, etc) and a marble female figurine (surviving height 9cm). This figurine with its great art and perfect working of the material is unique in type in continental Greece, and could be compared with the earlier figurines from Crete, a fact that shows links between Crete and Eleia already in the MH period. The most important find of the excavation is a small egg- shaped stone, 4.9 x 4.08 x 1.62cm, 48g in weight, found in an undisturbed destruction layer, wedged on the inside of one of the building's walls, below the first series of stones. On one face of the pebble there is an engraved inscription of Linear B, while on the other face there is engraved a double axe with two symbols of the same writing in the lower part, on both sides of</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 45 a vertical line that forms the handle of the double axe. According to philologist Professor L. Godart, who has exam- ined the stone, of the eight symbols engraved on it, five are common to Linear A and Linear B, while three are found only in Linear B. This shows that it is Linear B and indeed, it belongs to an early form of the script as shown in comparison with inscribed tablets of Pylos and Knossos. The inscription on one side of the pebble consists of six syllabograms forming two words, one of which denotes a profession, probably metallurgist. The other word is probably a Greek personal name, equivalent to 'Haropos' or 'Harops'. The two syllabograms that frame the double axe give a term that appears for the first time and is perhaps related to some religious practice, since the double axe is known to be a sacred symbol that is mainly Minoan. The date of the Kaphkania inscription in the mid 17th Ct BC appertains to the related questions of the chronological appearance of Linear B and the place where this writing was invented. The finds of Kaphkania are therefore exceptionally significant because they prove what until now was only suspected: that the culture of continental Greece had invented its own writing already from the end of the MH period." Morea Project. The 6th season of the Minnesota Morea Project took place in avgust 1996 under the direction of F.A. Cooper and J.D. Alchermes, who report: "The final goal of the Minnesota Morea Project is to publish an illustrated volume of the results of a seven-year investiga- tion. Towards this end, we devoted the 1996 season primarily to making scaled drawings of a selection of the houses surveyed in previous seasons. The drafting took place at the Neohori facilities during the month of avgust. In the final publications, all villages will be represented by at least one illustration of a prominent building or note-worthy house. Whenever appro- priate, a number of buildings will be drawn to present a village. In addition, we plan to include a map of every village and town surveyed showing the location of each built structure recorded by our teams. The initial set of buildings selected for drafting are those with date stones and those with unusual decorative details in either carved stone or paint. We hypothesize that these special features will aid in tracing the building route of regional stonemasons and perhaps in identifying the works of individual craftsmen. Our field season focused on three objectives: first, a survey of a few villages omitted from itineraries of past seasons, namely Andritsaina, Linitsaina and Fanari in Elis and Pteri, Vavara and Sidirokastro in NW Messenia. The training site for this year was Andritsaina where we mapped and recorded 60 houses. At Sidirokastro we recorded 66 houses. A second major undertaking for this season was a survey of the old town of Kiparissia. This effort was in co-operation with the 5th Byzantine Ephorate and under the direction of Miss Kalamara. It seems that Palaia Kyparissia is a much more extensive settlement than a first or passing impression. We pinpointed and mapped over 100 pre-modern stone construction houses located along the steep slopes of the abandoned N side of the modem city and the upper reaches above and E of the city. The third phase of our goals for this season was the prospection of uncharted Frankish foundations, as ascertained by written records. In 1992 and 1993 such reconnaissance was central to our goals. During the seasons of 1993 through 1995 we con- centrated on the mapping and recording of these sites. This summer we resumed prospection, using the methodology of earlier seasons, namely sources of information coming from the occasional and knowledgeable shepherd, a toponym, and satellite spectral imagery. At the headwaters of the Pineios river, our efforts bore extraordinary results. We discovered ruins for six early settlements at Agios Nikolaos, Mesivouni, Palaiohorio, Skiadas, Stavraki, and, probably, Petrohori. We applied this methodology for the NW Messenia area, around Sidirokastro and, curiously, our results were mixed. The places explored contained not only extensive terrace walls, suitable levelling for house construction, but also the scatter of roof tiles. But we found little or no evidence for traces of the actual houses. This difference between the adjacent regions may have an explanation after further study." (The original aims of the survey in 1991 are described in ADelt 180-1). Olympia. The following report has been received from Klaus Herrmann on the work of the DAI in 1996: "Under the overall direction of H. Kyrieleis, excavations at Olympia were carried out in the Bouleuterion, on the Kladeos embankment, in the area of the so-called SW baths and at the Pelopion Gate. K. Herrmann made two soundings in the entrance hall of the Bouleuterion to confirm the dating of the hall. This brought to light a large R fireplace in front of the N part of the middle complex; W of it and at a lower level lay a pit filled with poros fragments. Sherds found in the pit date the fill to ca 500 BC, so that it could be building debris from the construction of the N apsidal structure. The foundations of the middle complex were sunk into the pit, which confirms the older opinion that this part is the latest of the three main structures. It was probably built at the same time as the entrance hall, whose foundation trench contained sherds from the mid 5th Ct. Two trenches were also dug in the S area of the entrance hall, in order to investigate the spolia built into the foundations. It brought to light further parts of a small Doric building (Fig. 61: Doric elements in the foundation of the Bouleuterion entrance hall), which has been known about for a long time. There are now 13 monolithic column shafts, one capital and numerous wall blocks known, but the purpose of this strikingly delicate structure (column height 1.80 m) is still unclear. It could perhaps be a fore-runner of the later middle complex. At the N end of the 800m long Kladeos embankment, built to protect the sanctuary from flooding, J. Knauss and K. Herrmann dug away a good part of the fill to the E of it, which was still nearly 5m high (Fig. 62: R masonry [left] and alluvial layers from antiquity). It was found that above the original wall of squared blocks rose one of well-fitted field stones. It forms part of a R repair, which apparently became necessary after flooding in the 2nd or 3rd Ct AD. There are no indications for dating the old wall (almost 3m high) of squared stones, whose terminus has not yet been uncovered. The research project 'Olympia in the Roman Imperial Period and in Late Antiquity' continued under the direction of U. Sinn. Work in the club-house of the athletic guilds (so-called 'SW building') was concentrated on clearing the inner rooms. This year the removal of the fill in the main hall was started. Its state is essentially the same as that found two years ago in the hall W of it: it was subsequently provided with hypocaust heating and at the same time a bench was installed against the walls, built of brick and covered by marble slabs, remains of which were found at the front, by the door in the W wall. Precisely in front of this door, part of the marble floor is preserved. A second focal point was the final excavation in the small bath N of the club-house. Soundings carried out by Alfred</page><page sequence="46">46 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 63 A' Fig. 61 Fig. 62 Mallwitz (1980 and 1982) had already shown that there were further rooms N of the baths, but it was not clear whether they were related in time or even function. Now we can give a positive answer to both questions: the baths, together with the adjoining rooms to the N, form a coherent complex and were built in the later 3rd Ct AD, as shown by the stratigraphy established in previous years. This is confirmed by the Fig. 64 foundations, which were built in one single operation. There are few indications about the function of the total complex: in one of the rooms several storage vessels and remains of cooking places were found, which leads to the con- clusion that the building served for the care of guests, amongst /A</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 47 other things, and therefore belongs to the installations called 'kapeleion' (Kalcrrlov) in sacred inscriptions. They offered visitors to the sanctuary shelter, board and physical care; in some cases they even had shops. It is remarkable in the history of the sanctuary of Zeus in the late 3rd Ct AD that at this time another installation of this kind was built, in addition to the already existing ones (the Leonidaion, the feeding pavilion N of the Prytaneion and the guest-houses close to the Kladeos baths). In this connection it is worth remembering that in the 4th Ct AD a further 'kapeleion', the so-called 'S baths', was erected. This extension of the infrastructure is further proof of the undiminished popularity of the sanctuary, even in the 3rd and 4th Cts AD. A supplementary investigation in the Pelopion Gate, carried out by H. Kyrieleis and K. Herrmann, completed the series of excavations. Once again, part of a stone circle was uncovered, already observed by Dorpfeld, which enclosed the EH tumulus. Clearly separated by layers of sand devoid of finds, two foundation blocks and the remains of the A Pelopion wall rose above it, in turn built over by the C gate. Noteworthy among the finds is an excellently preserved LA gem (Fig. 63), recovered inside the gate from the layers below the wall containing the door." Pefkes. A Myc ChT of LH IIIA2 date was excavated from a known cemetery. The T is identified as number three. Finds were pottery and a large number of glass beads. (ADelt 132) Phigaleia. In the Ergon of the AS for 1996 (41-7) Xeni Arapoyianni reports that a new excavation in 1996 was undertaken in the area of the anc. city of Phigaleia. The temple, 15.7 x 7.7m, built with large squared blocks in the irregular isodomic style, survives to a greatest height of 3 courses (Fig. 64). The entrance is to the E and the threshold is in very good condition. The temple consists of a pronaos and a sanctuary with a monolithic and monumental threshold, with incisions for the fixing of the wooden parastades of the door. At the back of the sanctuary was found in situ a cubic stone pedestal (1.7 x 1.64m), in the upper surface of which there was a great squared tenon for the placing of a cult statue (Fig. 65). In front of the pedestal was found the table of offerings, with legs that end in lions' paws. The paws were fixed with lead joins on squared bases in front of the pedestal. The floor around the table of offerings and in front of the pedestal was covered in a thick layer of ash: this perhaps suggests conflagration. To the right (N) of the pedestal were found in disorder the bases of three statues, one of which was bronze. On the base of the bronze statue is engraved a dedicatory inscription according to which one Euagoras dedicated to Athena and Zeus Soter the bronze statue of Kallikrates. The temple, then, was dedicated to Athena and to Zeus Soter, the statues of whom the great pedestal of the sanctuary bore. The monument seems to belong to the 4th Ct BC. There survived, however, on both sides of the pedestal of the cult statue two older walls and scattered in the sanctuary architectural members of poros stone, doric capitals, fragments of columns, and parts of architraves. In the W part of the S wall of the temple had been incorporated a wall of poros blocks, which belongs to an older temple, from which probably come the poros architectural members. The use of the temple continued into late antiquity and into the Byz era. A great part of the front part of the sanctuary is strewn with clay tiles, while the W wall of the temple, that behind the pedestal of the cult statues, is later and includes older stones and inscriptions. Fig. 65 Finds inside the temple include the marble head of a young man with a band in his hair, and a small marble sphere with the remains of the hand that held it, both 4th or 3rd Ct. The fragments of inscriptions: proxeny decrees, lists and dedications, show that the temple was a place suitable for the communication of decisions or honours, for it was frequented by the public and extended chronologically from the 4th to the 1st Ct BC. A base for stelae was found outside in the facade. The erection of inscriptions in the temple of Athena and Zeus, particularly proxeny decrees that refer to proxenoi from Megalopolis, Byzantium, Kephallinia, Achaia and Ephesos, suggests that the temple had political importance for Phigaleians. In earth deposits outside the temple, which had come from periodical clearances inside, were found many bronze, iron and lead antiquities. There were also found many figurines of differing types, busts of women or animals, and domestic utensils. Among the figurines three portray figures with the hands raised in the well known worshipping gesture. Notable among the bronze finds is a plaque with a representation of the goddess Athena, and part of a lion from a handle of a bronze cup. Especially interesting is the bronze sheet with an A dedicatory inscription to the goddess Athena, which confirms the hypothesis of the antiquity of worship performed there. The number of small model boats as an offering is related by the excavator to a story in Pausanias (VIII.41.3) concerning ceremonies in honour of the river Neda. Close to the temple a MH settlement site was located. Pirgos. According to press reports a new archaeological museum will open here in 2002. Skilloundia. An E-W oriented pit grave was excavated. No finds were noted. The pit was covered by a massive slab. (ADelt 132) Staphidokambos. 10km W of anc. Elis a C cemetery was excavated. It was used continuously from the end of the 6th Ct to the end of the 4th Ct. Sixteen cremations, 12 tile graves and 7 burial pithoi were excavated. (Xeni Arapoyianni, 7th Ephorate, Kathimerini) Zakinthos. Agia Anna.

Two other walls seemed later in date, but exact chronology was not determined. More evidence of settlement was found 200m-300m further N. (ADelt 131-2) On the heights of Palaiokastro or Palaiophylakes above the village of Mouzaki, remains were found of a fortification wall and tower (?) that may date to the 8th-9th Ct, when the island was faced with attacks by Arab pirates. Paltry remains include round (diam. 5m) and semi-circular (diam. 3m) structures which stand side by side, although unconnected in any way. (ADelt 174) MESSENIA Chalkia. Two tholos Ts are noted at this site in the hills above Dorion (Triphylia). Both are about 4m in diameter and preserved to a height of 2m. They appear to date to LH II-IIIA. (Xeni Arapoyianni, 7th Ephorate, Kathimerini) Diodia. The 7th Ephorate (Xeni Arapoyianni writing in Kathimerini) excavated a small tholos T (2m high and 4.2m in diameter) that was not plundered, dating from LH I-IIA to LH IIIA-B. The tomb held the burials of 12-15 individuals, with plenty of badly preserved pottery and bronze small finds. Glikorizi. In ADelt 134-5, Y. Hatzi-Spiliopoulou reports on a probable Myc tholos T: "At a distance of 2km E of the cross-roads of Kalo Nero and 1.5km roughly north of the road from Pirgos to Kalamata, to the SW of the community of Glikorizi of Triphylia, I noted a low mound that very probably covers a Myc tholos T. The place with the toponym Pirgaki has an excellent view: to the W is the Ionian sea, to the NE extends the hinterland of Triphylia, and to the S the N comer of the prehistoric acropolis of Peristeria. The mound rises 2m-2.5m above the surface of the ground. The E side of it has been slightly damaged by the opening of the road that leads from this place to Glikorizi. At the crown of the mound and slightly off-centre there is a bulky stone 2m long and about 80cm wide. The displacement of the stone seems to be a result of agricultural work about 20 years ago. Under the stone there is an empty space up to Im deep. The existence of LH pottery on the surface and certain stones of the same type in peripheral positions of the mound suggest that it is clearly a mound of the Myc period. Other indications of prehistoric inhabitation were noted in the vicinity." Kaplani. On the summit of Vigla between Kaplani and Zizani was excavated a tholos T of diameter 5m and surviving height Fig. 67 about 2.5m, built of local flat rocks. The dromos, about 6m long, was stone-lined, while the lintel survives in situ. The tomb, plundered in antiquity, preserved untouched the burial of two corpses in a pit in the floor. A very small distance SE of it was located a second tholos of about the same dimensions, while the many sherds on the summit of the hill and all over it suggest the existence of other graves, and that perhaps the Myc settlement to which the cemetery belonged was located nearby. (Xeni Arapoyianni, 7th Ephorate, Kathimerini) Messini. In the Ergon of the AS for 1996 (47-57) P.Themelis reports: "Study of the two adjacent grave monuments outside the Arkadian gate, begun in 1993, was completed (Figs. 66, 67). One consists of two chambers with a Doric portico in the facade: each chamber bears on the walls one rectangular conch, and at the back of it a low pedestal for the sarcophagus. The Doric portico, length 14.5m, had ten columns. Its foundation consists of six steps, instead of the usual three in temple architecture. Inside the Doric portico were studied five pits in which had been cremated children accompanied by grave gifts: many pots, cups, incense burners and lamps. Together with these were found also fruits, pine cones, acorns and figs. The lamps, which date to the 2nd Ct BC, provide the dating of the cremation of the children. The second grave monument had the shape of a temple, an antechamber with squared columns and a chamber which also had three squared conches in the walls. Of the two sarcophagi that were inside in anc. times, fragments of the sides were found with reliefs of a battle (Fig. 68), work of the neo-Attic sculpture that flourished in the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD. Coins and epitaphs that date from the 4th to the 6th Cts AD attest the presence of Christians and the use of the monuments for their own dead. To the Christians is owed also the breakage of the sarcophagi. In the S atrium of the Asklepieion, between the stoa and the cult building, was studied a small circle of unworked stones, interpreted as probably a place for liquid offerings.

To the SW of the orchestra of the odeion was found a well with a number of broken pots and lamps. A few coins that were found with them date the fill of the well, along with the pottery, to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. Part of the E analemma and of the E parodos of the theatre was uncovered. Very close to the analemma were found the remains of a pottery kiln of the later years of the Roman empire. The fill of the kiln belongs to the 11th and 12th Ct. The inhabitation of the area of the theatre and of the nearby spring of Arsinoe in Byz times, is already well attested, mainly by the Byz chapels. In the past year was found yet another list of ephebes of Messene, inscribed in tribes just like the ephebes of the cities of the federation of Messenia, and of Asini. In the room of the great hall S of the bouleuterion, where in 1995 had been found fragments of cult statues of Herakles and of Hermes, were found in situ two bases with dedicatory inscriptions and in front of these two further marble statues: the one had an inserted head that was missing and wore a himation. Next to the left foot a cylinder for papyri shows that the por- trayal was of a scholar. According to the inscription on the base in front of which the statue was found, it appears to be Tiberius Claudius Theona, son of Nikeratos, whom Messini honoured in this way during the 1st Ct AD. The second statue is broken but almost complete. It copies the type of the Hermes of Andros (now in the Museum of Andros) and is naked with idealized characteristics. The head shows how very faithful is the copy. It had been brought from elsewhere to the place where it was found, as appears from the size of the pedestal, its re-use and re-inscription, the original inscription being now on the back face as found. A room in the same complex had its floor strewn with stone slabs, four of which had iron rings for pulling them up. Under the slabs were found rectangular grave thekai with remains of corpses and grave goods: perfume boxes, pyxides, lamps, curry combs (metal combs for horses), a mirror and gold leaf. The dead were interred in the 2nd or 1st Ct BC. The quality of con- struction and position in the gymnasium suggests that these were the graves of officials. The N colonnade and part of the E colonnade of the gymnasium were excavated. Many columns were found upright in situ. The E colonnade preserves on one column a dedicatory inscription in large letters: 'AyacoKcXfi; ZaTVpov) AtIO6 'I0o0gdra yevo6gevo iEp)c; i &amp;vE90rIKe t&amp;C tnaoacdxa Oeogi; nic K[ai trt toX6eit]. The W colonnade also bears an inscription of which part only survives: ['O 8Eva ... (VE90riKev 'Hpa]cKXf KCi t t&amp; i6XEt. Important among the inscriptions found in the E colonnade is an inscribed column of the 3rd Ct BC that has a list of the fallen at Makistos in Eleia. The beginning of the catalogue is conventional: di &amp;6 Eg MaKidazct, [sc. OC0tOavov]. According to the excavator those named on the column fell at the time of the capture of Elis by the Messenians, a fact that Pausanias mentions (IV.28.5-7). The work of restoration and repair of the tower NE of the Arkadian gate was completed with the financial support of the I.F. Kostopoulos Foundation. The condition of the roof was studied, as of the staircase and of the floors. The proscenium of the Ekklesiasterion (of the odeion) in the W wing of the Asklepieion was restored, while the restoration of the Propylon is continuing. The studies for the restoration of the HeroonMausoleum S of the Stadium were completed, and also of the Propylon of the gymnasium, and they will be put into action." Pylos, modern town.

L J---- , i a ; ^ ^4 ...A . - ..-I 6- im"I, 5 - e Fig. 68 Pylos. F.A. Cooper reports on the 5th season of the Minnesota Pylos Project: "As in 1991 to 1995, our purpose was to clean the area of backfill in order to create a state plan of the walls; earth was removed down to the lowest course of stone or to the level reached by the original excavators. A decision was made in 1992 to clear floors as well as walls; nevertheless, the presence of Blegen's backfill still defined in every case the extent of our own cleaning and operations. This season saw the completion of the Southwest building, begun in the previous season. We encountered none of the surprises of former years and thus none of the challenges to slow our progress. The so-called 'chasm' in the Palace proper, between the Archive rooms (7 and 8) and the propylon (1 and 2), opened in 1995, was further studied and documented before backfilling and reconstruction of the dismantled Blegen walls. In the 1994 season we discovered that Blegen used the three- metre deep cavities within the grillage of walls at the northwest area as a place to dump washed but discarded pottery from his many years of excavation. In 1994, 365 olive sacks were removed and in 1995 another 50 sacks totalling about 20 tons of pottery, roof tiles, stone tools, painted fresco fragments, etc. While this material lacks all context, it does provide an index and a range of typical artefacts and their relative quantities. The material also gives an idea of the chronological span of activity on the akropolis. Using the methodological system adopted in 1995 we processed the 50-plus olive sacks gathered last year. The large crew allowed for a greater devotion to the lotting and inventory of finds than was possible in previous seasons. Exposure of the Southwest building, especially in the area of rooms 63-65, allows for a re-assessment of building periods beyond that of the primary Myc IIIB constructions (Fig. 69). For instance, stairwell 69 is an obvious addition against hall 65. The northwest flank of hall 65 was reinforced by a secondary construction which abuts the earlier on the outside. The northeast end of this reinforcing wall aligns with the cross-axis of the front pair of columns inside the hall. On the opposite side of hall 65 there appears a series of walls which run perpendicular to the flank wall and towards the southeast. The earliest set postdates the hall; the northwest ends of a quadrangle abut the outside flank wall of hall 65. This forms a room having no obvious entranceway, but it does boast a 2m wide terrace with a view which runs along the southwest flank. Subsequently, an agglomeration of walls created additional cells around and to the southeast of this quadrangle. The last built wall in this area supersedes the earlier constructions including Hall 65 which had been levelled to the present elevation because wall B is built over the top of it. This makes wall B a post-palatial, probably Mycenaean, construction, comparable in date to a number of other features found at the site during these investigations. More enigmatic is the rectangular construction, 2 x 1.5m in this area. It consists of ashlar blocks of the type noticed in numerous walls at Pylos dating from pre-palatial to post- palatial times. Presently this base stands to a height of ca 0.4m and appears to have collapsed somewhat from a more tightly- built construction. Also, this installation involved the tearing out of all earlier walls in the vicinity to form an oval clearing of ca 5m to 6m in size. Questions concerning this feature bear further consideration and study. In the past several seasons, the topographic survey was made secondary to the obligations to the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project for engineering survey assistance and to the need for progressing with our objectives at the site. This past season we had the opportunity to resume mapping of the vicinity by GPS. This data has yet to be post-processed but will contribute to the eventual and detailed topographic plan of the Ano Englianos ridge.</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 51 The usual assortment of material came out of the excavated back-fill and the processing of the Blegen dump: fragments of fresco, early and late decorated pottery and the hindquarters of a terracotta animal. One object, however, arouses curiosity. It is a flattened piece of lead rolled into a cylinder 4.1cm in height and 1.4cm in outside diameter. The lead strip is 3mm to 4mm thick. No writing appears on the exterior and none is visible inside but this surface is all but obscured by the restricted size of the openings. Dr David Jordan of the American School and a specialist in curse tablets, has been asked to advise on the piece. The conservation laboratory, established in 1994, was set up this season in the Demotic School, near the dig house. Jenny Gliata and Kiki Spyropoulou, the assistant conservators, devoted the summer to conservation and catalogue activities. For next season, all that remains to be re-excavated at the site is an area 30 x 20m at the south end. There are plans to take low-altitude balloon photographs of the exposed remains. This will entail the temporary removal of the protective layer of soil." Pylos Regional Archaeological Project. J.L. Davis reports on PRAP's 2nd study season: "The goal of the season was to complete study of pottery collected in the three seasons of fieldwork sponsored by PRAP (1992-94). The artefacts are all currently stored in the Chora Museum. Study of all finds collected in the vicinity of the Palace of Nestor and at the site of Kanalos was completed. MBA pottery from Blegen excavations at the Palace of Nestor was restudied and approximately 300 profiles were drawn. All MBA and early LBA finds from PRAP were re-examined. Approximately 200 ceramic finds were drawn. Samples of pottery were removed for petrographic analysis at the University of Wisconsin. A general book summarising the results of PRAP in the context of overall Messenian history has been completed and we anticipate its publication in 1998. Two more technical manuscripts (ca 100 pages each) have been submitted to Hesperia. A full illustrated catalogue of all PRAP sites and selected artefacts is available on the WorldWideWeb at http://classics.lsa.umich.edu/PRAP/html/gazetteer.html. Blegen's excavations at Derizioti Aloni have been republished by Sharon Stocker as an M.A. thesis accepted by the University of Cincinnati (1996)." KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA Anemomylos Kerkyras. Part of an anc. building, sections of two A terrace walls, part of a drainpipe, and two wells were investigated at the Pierre plot. (ADelt 270-72) The wall-paintings in the church of the Archangel Michael at Ano Korakiana have been cleaned and restored. The archangel appears, unusually, in the conch of the apse, with co-officiating hierarchs below. Other depictions include St John the Baptist, Sts Constantine and Helen and St Theodore. The late 11th Ct date given to these frescoes makes them significant. A wall-painting phase from the mid-llth Ct was found underneath the restored frescoes. (Ergon 1996, 82-4) Armikes Ag. Georgiou (Aphion). Part of a Byz building and three cist tombs were discovered at the Louvros plot. (ADelt 268-70) Garitsa. Part of the extensive cemetery of the anc. city, including 41 burials of various types, four pyres, four clay constructions and a section of a funerary peribolos, was excavated at the junction of Odos Kyprou and the third Parodos Alkinoou. The tombs were pithos burials, plain burials on the ground, tile-roofed hut graves, tile-roofed cists, cremations and a single sarcophagus. The latter, as well as a funerary urn, a cremation and a pyre, were enclosed in the stone peribolos, dated to the end of the 7th Ct BC (625-600 BC). The clay constructions were apparently used for cremations. A row of 11 tombs (cist, funerary urns, plain burials on the ground), part of another anc. cemetery, were excavated at Odos Kyprou. Finds in the vicinity, probably from destroyed tombs, date them to the HL period. (ADelt 261-8) Kanalia. The area to the SW of the moder town of Kerkyra, by the Chalikiopoulos lake, was apparently used as a burial ground for individual burials from the A (ADelt 41, 124) to the HL period (ADelt 27, 429; 42, 341). Part of a sarcophagus lid was reported from the area. (ADelt 268) Kassiope. Two cist tombs were investigated at the Vlachos plot. (ADelt 268) Kerkyra Town. 1991 was the fifth year of excavations in the area of the anc. city, with the co-operation of T. Hackens of the Catholic University of Louvain la Neuve and R. Winkens of Brown University (USA) (ADelt 42, 340-1; 43, 342; 44, 298; 45, 284-6). The campaign was limited to area 6 of the baths. The excavated walls were plastered on the interior, while the deposit included a great quantity of roof tiles, household pot- tery, 31 coins, a few figurines and the upper part of a marble Aphrodite. The mosaic floor, found in the past, is not yet fully uncovered. (ADelt 254-5) Roman Kerkyra. For the purpose of clarifying the topogra- phy of R Kerkyra, as recorded on the Peutinger table, a survey was conducted, which revealed the existence of a pottery work- shop (kiln) on the coast of Ag. Stephanos, near Palaiokastritsa, and various sites in the Sagiada area. (ADelt 273) Phigareto. This was the ninth season of excavation in the area of the LA pit with the moulds (ADelt 44,296; 45,286). In the same area were discovered the remains of one more kiln, the 11th so far, with part of the chamber floor. Among the finds were many fragments of LA figurines, moulds and miniature altars. At the Giourga plot was excavated part of a 5th Ct BC shipshed, under a destruction layer, dated by a Corcyrean coin to 300-229 BC; under it lay an A layer. The excavated part of the shed consists of two parallel rows of piers, running E-W, at right angles to the coastline. Nine piers of the S row and five piers of the N row were uncovered. The main back wall of the shed should lie to the E of these rows of piers, which lined the slips used for drawing up the ships and supported the roof over them. To the right of the road from Phigareto to Kanoni were located the remains of four HL buildings. A main road, lined by these buildings, ran across the site with an E-W direction. The buildings were in use from the end of the 5th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct BC. The remains of two LA-LC buildings were discovered at the S. Chalikiopoulos plot. The earlier A building was probably a small popular shrine. (ADelt 45, 287) A n-shaped construction was excavated to the W of the Kassopitra monastery, near the pit with the figurines (ADelt 23, 123) It consists of a wall and two cross walls, with lumps of unbaked clay and bf sherds in the vicinity.

A postByz tomb was located on the slope of a hill, 290m from the Parapotamos tumulus, at the site</page><page sequence="52">52 DAVID BLACKMAN -1 Fig. 70 of Tsiphliki. It was probably part of the cemetery of the nearby MByz site of Parapotamos, which must have held a consider- able population. (ADelt 273) Philiates. The investigation of building r was continued, within the walls of the settlement near gates 2 and 4. It was built on a slope, and was divided into two equal sections, which lay on two different terraces. The exterior polygonal walls of the building acted as terrace walls, while the entrance was lined on either side by unfluted columns. The entrance led to an atrium with roofed stoas and 12 rooms along its three sides. The interior walls bore painted plaster, while the gravel floors were often only the substructure for mosaics. The finds in one room (No 4), and especially a bronze sheet covering the lion's paw foot of a piece of furniture, suggest that the house was once richly furnished. The importance of this building is emphasized by the discovery of a large number of coins, dated to 238-168 BC. (ADelt 272) Skala Philiaton. Part of a paved HL street, dated to 200 BC, was excavated at the site of Pegadoulia. (ADelt 272) BOIOTIA No report for 1991 was submitted to ADelt 46 by the 9th Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate. Boeotia Survey. Dr J.L. Bintliff and Prof. A.M. Snodgrass report on the 1996 study season: "The main target for 1996 was to enter on computer the sherd-by-sherd data record for the sites in the Thespiai and Palaiopanagia districts, which together number over 70 (well above one-third of the total to be covered in the three final study seasons), together with the material from the anc. city site of Thespiai, which runs to some 15,000 pieces. This task was completed on the last day of the season. Detailed study and re-study of the pottery collections was mainly concentrated on the Med period. A second area of work was the GIS surveying of three major nucleated sites with their in situ architectural features: Thespiai itself, Askra and Medieval Palaiopanagia (VM 4). This was brought close to completion, with a small amount of work at VM 4 still outstanding. In parallel, some geophysical sub- surface testing was carried out at VM 4 and Askra; a team worked for two weeks on the soils of the area; and contour planning of small sites continued." Panakton. The 1991 joint Greek-American excavations at this fortress (ADelt 46, 182-3), were already reported in AR 1991- 92, 29-31. Plataiai. Dr A. Konecny (avstrian Institute) reports on the start of survey work: "In 1996 the first campaign at Plataiai, conducted by a small avstro-Greek team, took place in October. The purpose of the survey is a new evaluation of the fortifications of this anc. town on the S slopes of Mt. Kithairon. To provide a sound basis for further work, efforts were concentrated on setting up a geodetic datum and establishing a new plan of the site. This was done: the geodetic survey of the ramparts was completed and at the moment the new plan of the town is in preparation. The remains at the site are not in a good state of preservation. Obviously a few more stretches of the fortifications have been lost since the time of the American expedition to Plataiai. Next year, a more thorough architectonic and archaeological survey of the walls will be undertaken, which will, hopefully, yield some interesting clues to chronological and fortification questions concerning the site." PHOKIS Delphi. Much work in 1991 was devoted to the preparation of celebrations of the centenary of French excavations at Delphi, including a volume to mark the occasion. Practical matters were also dealt with, to improve conditions on the sacred site: scattered architectural members were collected and stored; provisions were made against soil erosion, especially in the vicinity of the Theban and the Boiotian treasuries; the Phaedriades (rocks overhanging the Castalia fountain) were consolidated; the terrace of the Aitolian Stoa was more clearly delineated in terms of topography; the Stadium was freshly mapped. Furthermore, the sector of the Chariot of Rhodians was prepared for excavation and to this end monuments in this area were temporarily removed. (ADelt 200) The excavations of the French School in 1991 (ADelt 46, 202-5) were already reported in AR 1991-92, 31-2 (J.-M. Luce and V. Deroche). (AR 1991-92, 31, should read 'surprising', not 'hardly surprising'.) Mm. Badie, Deroche and Petridis (French School) report on their work on the SE villa in 1996: "The study of the building, resumed on the basis of the results of the excavations of 1995 and the new measurements, dealt essentially with the succession of phases and the hypotheses concerning the reconstruction of levels, passages and roofing. The permanence of the network of terraces in front of the villa, often of the A or C period, is confirmed, with a HL level well attested (confirmed by the C14 dating from the carbon discovered in a cooking-pot), and several R walls in front of the villa such as we know it at present; the extension of the terrace supporting the road to the S of the villa as far as the R agora, disrupted by the development of the tourist road, will perhaps give us a means of understanding better the function of the mysterious S part of the agora. The limits of the building are now more clear and we are beginning to study the allocation of the different constructions to the two phases of the villa in a sat- isfactory manner, with an uncertainty in the W where the several elements visible in the baulk and the Tournaire plan of 1897 permit us to envisage a complex join with an earlier state (C?)

Next year's excavation will have to be preceded by a fairly major earth clearance operation: the transfer of earth dumps into areas not excavated is no longer possible now that nearly all the surface of the building is going to be excavated, and we have to remove the majority of the previous earth dumps to outside the site enclosure. (Unfortunately, the NW 'bastion', gouged out by the rains of '92, has not yet been emptied of stray blocks and repaired, otherwise it would have taken a significant part of the earth of the dumps; nor has the dump removal planned for '95 on the SE facade been carried out). A preliminary text for the planned publication has been edited with at least two options open, depending on the type of publication finally decided for the whole of the late pottery. In parallel a new arrangement in one of the rooms of the apotheke of the dig house has enabled us to prepare space for the sherds which will come from our next campaign in 1997. The Lerat material as well as that from the Rougemont exca- vations was transported to the little upper reserve store constructed recently. The sherds from the remainder of the old excavations (before 1990) were carefully stored in new plastic boxes; the fabric bags, mostly worn out, were replaced by plastic bags. Unfortunately, the majority of sherds from the old excavations had no indications of provenance." Tolophona. Systematic excavations unearthed a settlement with its C fortification, a HL house with storage space for agricultural commodities and a rectangular public building. A hasty rescue excavation unveiled part of the N branch (5m long and 3m thick) of the perimeter enclosure at Galaxidi, which dates from the late 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 200-01) Veloukhovo. The archaeological survey by a Dutch team in 1991 (ADelt 46, 205-6) was already reported in AR 1991-92, 23-4 (S.C. Bakhuizen). EUBOEA The new Museum of Chalkis was renovated and reopened in 1991, after the destructive earthquakes of 1981. Apart from inscriptions, funerary monuments and other architectural remains exhibited in the outer parts of the museum, the single exhibition hall has three sections, which include maps, plans, diagrams and the most important finds of each period. The Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate has also re-organized the Eretria Museum, the collections at Aidepsos, at Potamia Kymes and the Karystos Museum. (ADelt 184-5) Chalkis. At Odos Kavalas buildings of the HL period were discovered, the most important of which opens onto a road running N-S. The internal arrangement of the building, with two courtyards and a circular well with a water pipe, suggests workshop activities. The area was occupied from G to R times. Further areas of workshop installations were excavated in the vicinity, including part of a cistern, a clay pipe and a circular well. At the junction of Odos Styron and Makre, a R building was discovered, including a cistern, glass vases and lamps dating to the 2nd-lst Ct BC. (ADelt 185-7) Eretria. In 1995 the archaeological activies of the Swiss Archaeological School extended to three parts of anc. Eretria. S. Schmid reports: "Acropolis: on the acropolis the soundings which had produced PR material in 1994 were extended eastwards in the direction of the prominent step in the terrain, which delimits the plateau on which the acropolis stands. Under a deep HL destruction layer several pits came to light containing A material, including miniature hydrias of the same type as those found in a votive deposit close to the Temple of Apollo. The digging of the pits disturbed G and Myc layers below, which only produced pottery fragments. Under these strata runs a deep layer which can be divided into two levels which are close in date: one belongs to the late MBA, the other to the early LBA, indicated by bowls and jugs of Minyan pottery and MH kraters with bichrome decoration (Fig. 71). The E-W Cyclopean wall, discovered in 1994 at the edge of the slope, continues eastwards. Although it was primarily a retaining wall for the slope, its thickness of about im makes it possible that it also served as fortification. The wall segment uncovered forms the S limit of a room, whose floor in the N was cut into the living rock, but in the S consisted of slabs. On the S side four steps give access to the room, although the exact connection between Fig. 72 53</page><page sequence="54">54 DAVID BLACKMAN room and wall could not be clarified, because of its bad state of O :~::~.~:. : . ~:~__~l~__ . ~ i _: preservation. In clefts under the MH floor, a secondary deposit !": . :......'.of LN and EBA sherds was found. Holes in the rock contained two MH infant burials; one was covered with a slab of slate, the other with an inverted pithos. Acropolis Cistern: on the E slope of the acropolis, the exca- vation of a large cistern, begun in 1992, was continued (Fig. 72: view at the end of excavations). It confirmed that the area !i:i·i ....................... ' . was not built on before the cistern was established. A first destruction layer, extending in the E as far as the city wall, l l -l :~':Ii dates from the end of the 3rd Ct BC. The main basin of the cistern and the coating of plaster on its outer side were built on this layer at the beginning of the 2nd Ct BC. The interior of the basin, whose lower part is cut into the rock, was water-proofed with a double layer of hydraulic mortar. The relevant installa- tions brought to light below the large basin belong to different phases, although the whole was abandoned in the middle of the 1st Ct BC, after a landslide filled the basin with material from the slope. Remarkably, no water conduit was found in the walls of the cistern, which indicates that rainwater, perhaps collected by a special arrangement higher up, was the only source of water. Numerous fragments of slag and remains of walls W of the basin suggest that this area was used for industrial activities in the later life of the city. Gymnasium: several small soundings were carried out in the Upper Gymnasium, in order to clarify some details, which led to the discovery of several U-shaped drains. A drain of worked limestone blocks in the NE corner of the courtyard drained water from the basin in room D, which was sunk into the floor. It runs parallel to the N stylobate of the courtyard, but could only be cleared for a length of 2.80m. A terracotta conduit in room J continued towards the SE as a rock-cut channel (Fig. 73). Another rock-cut channel was found N of Fig. 73 Nord St 1 Sud St 2 St 5 Ml M3 St 12 Aufsicht mit Lage der Profile S&lt;ndn I id IV *vs::.^^ 0.; .- -S 1 2 m f:::E i :~ Fig. 74 ....</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 55 room B. This channel must have been in use before the tholos and rooms H, I and J existed. A piece of a cylindrical water conduit, clearly removed from its original context, was found in the same location. North of the retaining wall, which forms the N limit of the gymnasium, the compact surface of an anc. road was found. In addition, in 1995 a geophysical survey was carried out W of the theatre and in the area of the Upper Gymnasium, in order to find anc. structures before excavation." Schmid also reports on excavations in the area between the 'House of the Mosaics' and the Upper Gymnasium, carried out in 1996: "The new excavations carried out from 1993 to 1995 in the Upper Gymnasium underlined the necessity of exploring the area between the gymnasium and the so-called 'House of the Mosaics'. On the one hand, current opinion holds that the later (R) living quarters were in this area at the S foot of the acropolis; on the other hand, several archaeologists suggest the existence of a stadium at this spot (cf. D. Knoepfler, AntK 12, 1969, fig. 1; P. avberson/K. Schefold, Fuhrer durch Eretria [1972] 7.190 fig. 32; E. Sapouna Sakellaraki, Eretria, Site and Museum [1995] 24ff). The stadium hypothesis began with a plan by Charles Robert Cockerell, who visited Eretria in 1814 and recorded a stadium on the S slope of the acropolis. Excavations in 1996 concentrated on the area E/600 NW on the overall plan of Eretria (for a more detailed preliminary report see S.G. Schmid, AntK 40, 1997). In this section occurred the change from private to public buildings of the anc. city. The aim of the coming campaigns is to chart this change archaeologically. Four soundings were made in 1996. Soundings II and III in the N of the area showed no trace of any buildings, so that at present the hypothesis of a stadium in this area cannot be confirmed or denied. Soundings I and IV in the SW corer of the area cut into part of the anc. road, which, coming from Chalkis, crossed the city at the foot of the acropolis and left it via the E gate in the direction of Amarynthos. Five levels of the road surface were uncovered (Fig. 74: schematic E profile of soundings I and IV, St 1, 2, 5, 10, 11): the earliest dates from the end of the 4th Ct BC, while the latest was used till the beginning of the 2nd Ct AD. The latest structure was a tomb immediately N of wall 1 (Fig. 74 St 3), which cut through all five surface levels. The tomb was a simple pit covered with re-used architectural pieces, had a tomb-stone in situ and contained three superposed burials. The lack of any grave goods makes precise dating impossible; the type of tomb, however, suggests the ECh era. S of the road the NE comer of a building was found, whose outer walls were of slightly rounded polygonal masonry. The building can be dated to LC or EHL times and, together with the road running immediately in front of it, remained in use into the Roman Imperial Period. Below the earliest road surface the alluvium of a stream came to light (Fig. 74 'Flussbett'). A few LG sherds were found in its strata, confirming the hypothesis of C. Krause and P. Themelis that an arm of the river which flowed outside the W city wall was in the G period diverted E at the height of the W gate. N of the road, a massive well appeared with a diameter of 1.20m and a preserved height of ca 5m (Fig. 74 St 13). It is lined with 8 terracotta rings, 0.62-0.65m high, which consist of three segments joined together with lead clamps. Halfmoon- shaped footholds are arranged at regular intervals. The remains of at least one other terracotta ring were found at the bottom of the well. The fill consisted of large quantities of homogeneous pottery and contained several fully preserved vessels of the West Slope style (Fig. 75: kantharos), which can be dated to the Fig. 75 Fig. 76 first quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. A marble votive hand in relief (Fig. 76), also found in the fill, suggests that the sanctuary of a healing god lay not far away. At the bottom of the well, immediately on the rock and in the ground water which was about lm deep, a hoard of 338 silver and 16 bronze coins came to light. Three pieces of gold sheet and a fragment of silver, probably parts of jewellery pieces, were also part of the hoard, which was probably contained in a receptacle of organic material when submerged in the well. The largest part of the coins were issues of the Euboean League and of Athens, which accords with the composition of coin finds from Eretria up to now. Nor is the presence of coins of the reign of Alexander III and of Chalkis surprising, in con- trast to the coinage of Demetrios Poliorketes (306-286 BC), of which in the 33 years of Swiss excavations at Eretria not a single example had come to light, while they constituted one fifth of the coin hoard found in 1996. It is probably to be</page><page sequence="56">56 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 77 explained by the Macedonian domination in Euboea from 304 to 286 BC. The latest coin of the hoard is a tetradrachm from the later part of the reign of Antiochos I of Syria (from 282 to 261 BC). The circumstances of the find suggest that the threat of war was the reason for hiding the coins in the well. The dating of the latest coin suggests that the war in question was the Chremonidean War (267-262/1 BC). That in fact several quarters of Eretria were indeed violently destroyed during the years 270-260 BC is confirmed by the destruction layer of the House of the Mosaics and by two comparable hoards found in 1981 by the 11th Ephorate in Eretria (P.G. Kalligas, AE 1983 [1985] 113f; M. Karamesini- Oikonomidou, AE 1983 [1985] 137ff.)." Lefkandi. During October 1996, M.R. Popham, for the BSA, oversaw the final stages of the restoration of the Heroon at Lefkandi, as well as the construction of a perimeter fence around the Xeropolis excavations, in collaboration with Dr E. Sakellaraki of the Chalkis Ephorate. He reports: "The new perimeter fence around the excavation on Xeropolis was made possible by a special grant from the British School in order to avoid delaying this work. The new posts and netting are of rust-proof metal which, since it will not require periodic repainting, provides a permanent solution to the enclosure of the antiquities. As for the Hero6n, the cover of the central burials has been erected and clay laid on the cement roof to harmonize with the surrounding floor of the room. The stair is now appropriately protected (Fig. 77). The large pit in the centre of the building has been filled in and the rest of the robbed-out walls have been reconstructed using the previous method of covering cement blocks with a clay plaster finish for aesthetic purposes. In addition, the entire area has been cleaned so that this important building is respectably presented. The attractiveness of the archaeological site has been enhanced once again by the planting of new trees and bulbs." Phylla Fort. In October 1996 a two-week excavation at the site of Vrachos (Phylla) in Central Euboea was carried out jointly by the 1 th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities at Chalkis (Dr E. Sakellaraki) and the BSA (Dr J.J. Coulton and Mr Mervyn Popham, assisted by Dr. E.M. Hatzaki). Dr Coulton reports: "The site of Vrachos, about 3.5km inland from Lefkandi (first report: G.A. Papavasiliou, AE 1903, 115-34; recent topographical survey: AR 1994-95, 31), shows traces of limited EH I occupation, perhaps associated with the main fortification wall around an area of ca 1.7 ha., and of a LA-EC phase con- sisting of a cross wall, cutting off the W part of the enclosure, and four inner buildings. A test against the E side of the older \ ' F o ri fi ric a t i o n ,` -- =- = 0 m- 10 0 o I00 / I. ... l .. ~ . i I I I I 5 X I- z . = Fig. 78</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 57 Fig. 79 Fig. 80 Fig. 81 fortification produced no dating evidence, and the main focus of interest was building 3, 110m long and consisting of a row of 20 identical rooms opening onto a long narrow terrace (Fig. 78). Its size, form and location on a strong but waterless site suggested military accommodation (which the discovery of a bronze arrowhead in room 2 now confirms), about which little is known, and the choice of site apparently within the territory of classical Chalkis, but looking out towards Chalkis rather than Eretria, raised interesting historical issues (D. Evely, I.S. Lemos, S. Sherratt (eds) Minotaur and Centaur, Studies... Mervyn Popham [1996] 161-5). The BSA group began by excavating room 2 (numbering from the W) while the Ephorate group excavated room 4. The S half of the floor of room 2 was laid on a fill of fist-sized stones, whereas bedrock protruded in its N half. The floor surface consisted of a thin layer of fine shaley gravel which seems to have originated in a thin stratum which outcrops in the NE corer of the room and below the E wall. This floor was little trodden, and produced comparatively little pottery-no whole pots but the bases of three small cups and a substantial fragment of a kylix. Near the E wall was a well-preserved three-edged arrowhead (Fig. 79: Snodgrass, EGA 151-3, type 3B5). In the centre of the room a rectangular enclosure (0.65 x 0.70m) formed by four half pan-tiles suggests a hearth, but no sign of burning was found (Fig 80). Some pebbles (tools?) and an obsidian flake probably infiltrated from the EH occupation. Above the floor was a thick layer of roof tiles of Cor type, lying in clay which must originate from the decayed mud-brick of the upper walls (Fig. 81). In spite of the apparent quantity of tile, however, substantial elements of only about 40 pan-tiles and a similar number of cover-tiles were found of the 140 of each that would have been needed to roof the room. Removal of the tiles for re-use is also indicated by small stacks and alignments of cover tiles, which could not result from natural collapse. Any whole pots not taken when the building was abandoned would presumably have been removed at this stage. The BSA group then moved to room 17, to assess uniformity in construction and occupation at the W end of the building. In the time available only the E half of the room could be excavated, sufficient to show the same general pattern, but with some significant differences. The uppermost floor, probably the only intentional one, was again thin, little trodden, and con- structed in the same way (but with a packing of larger stones), and the pottery from above it was similar to that in room 2; but there was no central 'hearth', no shaley gravel as floor surface, and the remains of the tiled roof were scantier and more fragmentary. There were fragments of Cor type (as in rooms 2 and 4), including eaves and ridge tile, but a larger number of fragments of Laconian type. It is hard to see how the two different roofing systems could be combined in one roof, yet the stratigraphy gave no sign of a second occupation phase. Tests beneath the floor of room 17 revealed a much firmer but sloping surface continuing beneath the E wall of the room, and another trodden surface halfway up the floor fill of large stones. Since the pottery from below the sloping surface included material of much the same type as that above the floor, it is likely that both surfaces relate to the construction of building 3, the lower one compacted during the movement of heavy blocks from the rocky ridge behind the building to the terrace wall in front. However, the quantity of pottery from below the final floor suggests significant occupation shortly before the construction of building 3, and several LG sherds show use of the site during the late eighth Ct BC (Fig. 82). The general form of building 3 was known before excava- tion, but more can now be added, especially about the roof. The complete system of Cor tiling could be recovered, including special cover- and pan-tile forms for the eaves and ridge, although these were all undecorated. Complete or near- complete specimens of each form from rooms 2 and 4 were placed in the Eretria museum. A curious feature is that the normal cover-tiles are of two types (occurring in roughly equal numbers), one wider and steeper in cross-section than the other,</page><page sequence="58">58 DAVID BLACKMAN ment, yet it seems to have been abandoned voluntarily soon after completion and never used again. The finds from rooms 2 and 17 are broadly comparable, and shed interesting light on the commissariat. Most of the sherds come from small, fine, but undecorated cups and from coarse gritty cooking ware in various fabrics. Other shapes include a few lamps and some larger drinking vessels, but amphoras- coarse or fine-are rare, suggesting that wine drunk was brought up in skins; so too perhaps the water, since no cistern has yet been found. There was almost no bone or shell in these two rooms, which suggest that the diet was mainly cereals, transported presumably in sacks and eaten as some kind of gruel or porridge. The cooking pots were of normal domestic size which indicates food preparation in small groups (room by room?), and three cup bases carried a crudely scratched letter, presumably to indicate individual ownership within the communal setting. The immediately datable material from above the floors of the two rooms (including two cup fragments with late decora- tion from room 17: Fig. 83) dates to the late 6th-early 5th Ct, and so too does most of that below the floor of room 17 (including a lamp fragment of Howland Type 5 or 14). Further study may modify this picture, but it seems to confirm the suggestion that the second major phase of occupation of Vrachos was associated with the Athenian cleruchy at Chalkis in 506-490 BC. Some of this occupation preceded building 3, which may have been built only shortly before the Athenians abandoned the cleruchy in the face of the Persian invasion. The occurrence of LG pottery-again mainly cups-suggests similar occupation during the Lelantine war. If Eretria was fighting for the Lelantine plain, its territory must then have run at least up to the river Lelas, with Vrachos presumably an important border fort; it is possible that the main wall circuit belongs to this period rather than the EH. When the boundary between the two cities moved farther E, the Vrachos fort would lose that importance, and it is noteworthy that no identifiable 7th- or 4th- Ct sherds have been found." Skyros. Three G cist tombs, with offerings, were discovered at the site of Chorapha-Kambos, where more G tombs had been excavated in 1990. The grave offerings consisted of pottery, 150 faience and iron beads, 14 pieces of an ivory object with teeth and perforations and parts of five ivory pins. (ADelt 187-9) which could not be efficiently combined in the same file. The ridge beam presumably ran E-W, thus explaining the greater thickness of the side walls of the rooms (0.80m as against 0.60m), and carried rafters running the 3m from ridge to front and rear walls. Whatever the explanation of the tiles of Laconian type in room 17 (the fragments were too small to allow recovery of the original shapes and forms of the tiles), the fragments of Cor tile in the same room suggest that this more monumental form originally covered the whole building. The blocks of the wall footings are normally set with the cleavage plane vertical so as to achieve a reasonably clean wall face without any tooling, and the space between the two faces was packed with mud and small stones. The stone was quarried at the site, but the mud brick for the upper walls (probably over 1,000 tonnes) and the 6,800 tiles for the long roof (about 67 tonnes) would all have to be brought up from below. There are massive clay beds only about 500m away at the W end of the ridge, but the climb is about 100m. Even with its simple materials, the building represented a major community invest- NORTHWEST GREECE Dodone. The last excavation by Sotiris Dakaris for the AS was in the Prytaneion in 1996 (Ergon 1996, 64-9; Fig. 84). It was established that the original form of the Prytaneion was the building known hitherto as building O-a rectangular hall and peristyle court. The roofs of the stoas surrounding the court sloped inwards. The complex was built in the period 340-234 BC (Figs 84-85). The W hall of the complex was not originally a meeting place; it fulfilled that function from LHL times, when stone seats were added around the walls. It is thought that the 'eternal fire' burned in the middle of the hall. Towards the end of the 3rd Ct, before the Aitolian destruction in 219, a row of rooms was constructed N of the hall and court, three of which are thought to have provided lodging for the archontes, and each had 9 couches. These constructions put out of use the original door of the complex on the N side, now replaced by an entrance on the E side of the court; another result was the demolition of Fig. 82 Fig. 83</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 59 - ., e --~- Kato Merope.

To this second building period is dated also the small circular foundation in the SW corner of the court, perhaps for an oven or hearth for preparing meals for the archontes. The excavations confirm that the Prytaneion was destroyed by fire by the Romans in 167 BC. The rooms N of the court were temporarily re-used. After the re-formation of the Epirot Koinon in 148 BC, or later in the 1st Ct BC, the W hall was rearranged: stepped stone seats were built on the R destruction level, and a corridor and bema. A new broader peristyle was built in the court. In the post-Byz period, private houses were built over the area of the Prytaneion. Agios Georgios (4km SE of Pherae/Velestino).

A sample four amphoras were raised, dating from 410-380 BC; the main cargo appeared to be wine on its way from Mende in Chalkidike and Peparethos (Skopelos). The sandy bottom offered good prospects for preservation of the ship's timbers. The ship's length appeared much greater than that of other anc. wrecks which have been studied. Demetrias. In the almond grove of G. and D. Kordela, NW of the place known as the stadium of anc. Demetrias, the excava- tion of house foundations located an apparently unrobbed sarcophagus with pots and sherds deposited outside its W end. Within it were two burials with two bf lekythoi and an oinochoe dating to the beginning of the 5th Ct BC. Many C tombs have been dug in the same area. Palace. In 1991 new excavations were begun in the peristyle court, in the E of the palace complex, with the object of digging the fill remaining on either side of the colonnade. The W, S and E stoas were cleared, and fallen plaster showed that the S and E stoas had had frescoed walls. Many fallen roof-tiles were found, some with stamps. The S stoa had a floor of limestone chips set in earth, while the courtyard floor was the schist</page><page sequence="60">60 DAVID BLACKMAN bedrock of the area, which had been levelled off for the palace's foundation. Part of the S stoa underwent conservation. In the S wing, seven tile graves and six pit graves were exca- vated, all except two without grave goods. The two exceptions had respectively a gold ear-ring, and a LR oinochoe plus a bronze coin of the time of Diocletian. The S stoa and the chambers of the S wing of the palace were used as a LR/ECh cemetery, as the palace was deserted after the defeat of the last Macedonian king, Perseus, by the Romans. The pottery from the excavations was typical of the 3rd and early 2nd Cts BC. Most of the coins were 3rd-Ct BC. (ADelt 207-8) Palea. Remains of the ECh-Byz city of Volos (anc. Demetrias) were found, including part of the fortification walls, mentioned by Prokopios as having been repaired by Justinian. Habitation appears to have extended into the Byz period proper, and the city seems to have flourished. Remains of an ECh bath complex are also reported. (ADelt 237-40) Evidence for anc. foundations of a previous phase was found under the ECh basilica excavated in Agion Theodoron square. (ADelt 240). Further evidence for a Byz settlement on the site of present-day Volos has been uncovered on Odos Gallias. The site appears to have been destroyed in the 7th or 8th Ct and was then covered by 1-2m. of fluvial deposit. A section of a rectangular building was uncovered with walls of alternating courses of blocks and bricks. Various floor phases were uncovered, one with marble tiles. The destruction level showed signs of fire. Two built cist tombs were also discovered with multiple Ch burials. Marble relief and colonnette fragments were uncovered. No substantial coin or pottery finds are recorded. (ADelt 240-1) Gioura: Cave of the Cyclops. In a general article on Pal sites in Euboia and the N. Sporades, A. Sampson refers to his Mes cave site on this island and illustrates fish-hooks and some of the quantities of fish-bones found there. He makes the point that though Pal sea levels were much lower than the present, and Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonnisos were then joined to Thessaly, the great depths between Alonnisos and Kyra Panagia, and again between Kyra Panagia and Gioura, indicate that there must always have been channels between these islands, and as some Pal finds have come from the lowest levels in the cave on Gioura, and others have been noted on the neighbouring uninhabited islands, people must have been sailing and navigating even at this early period. (Archaiologia 60, Sept. 1996, 51-60). Halos. H.R. Reinders reports on work in 1996: "Research in the area of the HL city of Nea Halos continued with the study of finds from earlier excavations, and with the surface survey of the area SW and SE of the city of Almyros. A surface survey took place of the S side of the Almyros plain, between Anthotopo and Platanos Marsh, in co-operation with Groningen University and the 13th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. In 1996 we walked all the ridges from Anthotopo to Karatza Dagli and from the old village of Platanos as far as Kephalosi. A large number of settlements were found of the C-HL and EByz periods; one site probably dates from the BA. The sites of the finds are all located on the ridges which run down from the foothills of Mt Othre to the plain, and in general in areas marked as Neogene on the geological maps. A surface survey was also carried out in and around the area of the Marsh SE of the village of Neos Platanos. In the middle of the marsh an MBA site was found; a representative number of surface finds was collected, including pottery, bones, sea shells and stone tools. Some important finds appeared around the marsh, including a HL-R settlement; and some Med settlements (12th Ct AD) were found including a large agricultural settlement and the remains of a small fortified church. In all 48 new sites were discovered in 1996. Following up the research of 1994 some more houses were measured and planned (now totalling 12) in the deserted village of Platanos." Phthiotic Thebes. Fortification wall. As fuel tanks and their supply pipeline for the airport of Nea Anchialos were to be located partly within the archaeological zone, in 1991 excava- tions were undertaken in threatened areas. On the proposed tank site, 600m W of the trig. point on the known acropolis of Phthiotic Thebes, part of an anc. fortification wall was found. It was 2.80-3.00m wide and 2km in extent, well-built and with towers at regular intervals. It enclosed a naturally defensible hill and had two long walls (W and E) which ended at the known acropolis. Sherd material from its W gate dated it to the 4th Ct BC. It may have enclosed the original city of Thebes which was built when the synoecism with the neighbouring cities of Pyrasos and Phylake took place in 356-340BC. (ADelt 208) Cemetery. The field of B. Kitsiou lay S of the anc. city of Phthiotic Thebes, only 50m from the fortification wall, in an area known to be the anc. cemetery of the city. Deep ploughing hit graves and a rescue excavation cleared five cist tombs. One was HL with two skeletons, one was totally robbed, and three were partly or wholly built of re-used HL tombstones; one of the latter graves had a R coin. Another 12 inscribed funerary steles, and one with a carved scene, were collected. (ADelt 208-9). In the neighbouring Roupakia field two more cists were cleared. They were HL, with the customary grave goods. (ADelt 210) An inscribed marble funerary stele was collected E of the fortification wall of the anc. city. (ADelt 218) Shrine of Asklepios. The foundations of a small temple to Asklepios were found near the S part of the fortification wall. Its ante-chamber measured 1.80 x 5.00m and its main chamber 5 x 5m. It had been roofed with Lakonian type tiles and it faced E. In the centre of the main chamber's W wall was a stone base with two parallel sockets in its surface. A bench ran round the N and W sides of the room, and may have continued on the S side, but that wall had fallen away. In the fill was found part of a small marble votive base, inscribed: KAHTIIQ (A.Kcrintom). Also within the building were many clay figurines, sherds, knuckle-bones, part of a small marble statue, two marble heads (one of a youth, the other of a little girl), the lower part of a marble statuette of the Asklepian type, a headless marble statuette of Aphrodite and Eros, and many body parts such as hands and feet. A few metres E of the temple was a base for the statue of the god. A marble torso and a marble head of the god which were handed in in 1960 were said to have come from the area of the temple. Votive steles dedicated to him had also been previously found. The temple was surrounded by a stone-built peribolos containing other buildings probably connected with the shrine, but these were not excavated. Coins suggest the shrine was in use during the 4th-lst Cts BC. (ADelt 209-10) Basilica of the Archpriest Paul. Work reported for 1991 includes further excavation of this EByz basilica, in the W wing of the atrium where a floor of a later period was dis- covered. An interior mosaic floor (geometric motifs with a</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 foliate border) was totally uncovered (4.60 x 4.40m) lm underneath the tile floor of phase 3, although its original context has not been established. Yet another mosaic floor was discovered underneath this one (double border, foliate motifs). Excavations in the S aisle of phase 1 discovered traces of buildings older than the first half of the 4th Ct AD. Wall- painting fragments dated to before the 5th-Ct basilica are also reported. Other phases of mosaic floors are also reported, and appear to have been associated with the basilica or previous structures. (See also PAE 1991, 146-168, pls. 95-101). The finding of part of the outer fortification walls of anc. Phthiotic Thebes is also reported. The excavated wall is well built with rough stone blocks and little use of mortar, and runs for about 1 lm, with a greatest extant height of 1.50m. Drainage conduits were also found associated with the wall. Other remains reported include a mud-brick ECh storage area of a private house (?), and an important ECh public building with two wings, possibly associated with the nearby Martion basilica built in 431 and the bath-house with magnificent mosaics found in 1973. (ADelt 234-7) Rachoula (15km SSW of Karditsa). At the locality of Toumba, 2km NE of Rachoula on the road to Kallitheros excavations for a community water supply led to the rescue excavation of 18 tombs (10 cist graves, eight tile graves) of the mid-4th Ct BC. Grave goods included bg and undecorated pottery and two bronze coins of Philip II. Two cists and a tumulus had previ- ously been excavated in the area, and all are thought to be part of an extensive cemetery, perhaps belonging to an unexcavated settlement site 700m S known as Palioklesia, where 4th-Ct material has been collected. (ADelt 216-7) Skopelos (anc. Peparethos): Panormos. (On E coast, directly across the island from the capital). To the S of Palaikastro hill on which is the fortified acropolis of anc. Panormos, five test trenches were sunk below the foundations of a hotel complex to be built on the K. Zanika-A. Laude plot. Below layers of silt and sandy gravel ca 1.50m deep, the remains of small walls of ordinary dwellings of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC were encoun- tered. The destruction level contained numerous sherds from the well-known Peparethan amphoras, many roof tiles of Lakonian type, and a few sherds from other pots, some bg. Masses of burnt clay and sherds warped in firing suggest that this might have been a production centre for the amphoras. Excavation stopped at 2.20m below the surface when the water table was reached, but anc. strata and buildings continued below this level. It is suggested that the houses may be part of the lower city of anc. Panormos. Velestino (anc. Pherae). Excavations took place in the yard of the small church of Agios Charalambos before the addition of a narthex and auxiliary facilities. The church plot is on the E slopes of the prehistoric mound Magoula Bakale to the W of the mod. town. In the test on the site of the new narthex, square, built pillar bases and part of a stone paving were found only 10cm below the surface. These probably belonged to an earlier church of Agios Charalambos marked as a ruin on the late 18th-Ct AD map of Regas Pheraios. At the same depth, two Ch graves were found. At 0.60-0.69m below the surface there was a 4m length of a C terrace wall. A small stratigraphic test taken to bedrock gave evidence of HL, C, A, G and Myc presence, and below all was a thick EBA stratum. On the site of a new bothros ESE of the church 12 closely-packed Ch graves in two successive layers were discovered, the upper graves only 0.10-0.40m below the surface. All were undisturbed but had no grave goods. Some were lined with stone slabs or C material in secondary use. Amongst the latter was a piece of a marble pyramidal column with part of a votive inscription. (ADelt 211-12) The Theodoropoulos plot is on the NW slopes of the modem town, but in a central position in anc. Pherae, N of the Hypereian Spring. The excavation preceding the building of a house (the first on the site in mod. times) located the NE part of a HL house with a peristyle court. In the NE part of the courtyard was a domestic shrine with a circular stone peribolos (diam. ca 1.80m) within which a small undecorated stone stele was set upright. An oval clay vessel, probably a receptacle for offerings, was sunk into the ground before it. This had a central division and was covered by a schist slab. In a room in the NE comer of the building, a P-shaped structure screened the entrance to an underground cistern, reached by a tunnel cut into the rock, running SW. The tunnel was 12m in length, 0.80m wide and ca 2m high, and descended by 22 rock-cut steps to the rectangular (ca 2.50 x 2.50m) cistern, which would have been beneath the house's court. The floor of the cistern was ca 9m below the present surface. Its SW wall had a rectangular opening which communicated with a well. On the NE side of the house, a road ran NNW-SSE. An Ott road followed and the mod. road still follows its course. Below the floor of the HL house were a possible earlier stage of the same building, and an earlier A or 5th-Ct BC building phase. Bedrock lay ca 1.50m below the moder surface, and in the general fill above it HL, C and smaller quantities of A, G, Myc and MH material were recovered. On the SE side of the plot a part of an anc. cemetery, known from other nearby plots, was discovered. In pits and slab-lined cists were slightly contracted single burials of children and adults. There were few grave goods, but the tombs were probably Myc and PG. (ADelt 212-13) In a plot on the corner of Heroon Polytechneiou and Xanthou, on the SE side of the anc. city, and very close to the fortification wall, the excavation of house foundations showed up the SE part of a 2nd-Ct BC house. Its NNW-SSE orientation provided useful information about the street grid system in this part of the anc. city, which does not seem to have been settled before the HL period. (ADelt 214-5) The plot of M.Tetsia is on the SE side of the plateau which extends N from the Magoula Bakale. An excavation took place in the limited area required for foundations of an extension to the existing house. The upper 3m of fill was much disordered, with few building remains and some HL, C, G and Myc pottery. Below this was an undisturbed MBA level, with typical pottery and remains of walls, hearths, etc. EBA pottery and stone tools were encountered 0.70m lower, and this continued to bedrock, ca 5-5.50m below the surface. This plot must represent the NE limits of the MBA settlement, as in a neighbouring plot a MBA cemetery was discovered. (ADelt 215) In a large bothros being excavated in the yard of the public abattoir, which is to the N of Velestino near the chapel of Agios Menas, part of the N fortification wall of the anc. city was found, and was to be the subject of systematic future research. (ADelt 215) The excavation of another bothros in the Chatzekotoula plot, SE of the Hypereian Spring and in the E part of the anc. city, allowed the stratigraphy of this area to be examined. The upper of two strata, 1.90m thick, was very disturbed, having mod. debris and Ott, HL, A, G, and Myc pottery. The lower stratum contained sparse remains of a 2nd-Ct BC building, consisting of part of a wall and a floor, and a contemporary well. The well was lined with terracotta rings. It was only excavated to a depth 61</page><page sequence="62">62 DAVID BLACKMAN of 1.45m. The discovery of a well so close to the Hypereian Spring is interesting and in conjunction with others discovered, suggests that each household had its own water supply. What contribution the famous spring made to the town water supply remains to be studied. (ADelt 216). A Greek-Italian survey of the area surrounding anc. Pherae continued in 1991. It concentrated on the shoreline of the Pagasitic Gulf, between the settlement of Chryse Akte Panagias (Kader-Aga) and the Angistri peninsula, in order to locate seaside settlements and harbours which might have been connected with anc. Pherae and its related villages. Natural routes between the coastal zone and the inland area of Pherae were also examined, and the chief of these is the kalderimi which connects today's village of Sesklo with Chryse Akte Panagias. This road has been in existence from at least the MByz period to the present. Along it, on the height of Mikre Velanidia, remains of a small LR settlement were noted, while on the upland plain of Souvala there were unusual groups of post-Byz, stone-built, two-roomed structures, rectangular in plan but with domed roofs, which probably had a pastoral use. (ADelt 218) PHTHIOTIS. The site of prehistoric 'Magoula' at Limne, near Domokos, where a N settlement has been identifiied, the hill of Melidoni, identified with the anc. fortified town of Lokrian Alope, and the site of the temple of Artemis and Apollo in the area of Kalapodi, have been proclaimed archaeological sites. (ADelt 195-6) Ag. Ioannis Theologos Malesinas (Lokrian Halai). Part of the anc. poros quarry, exploited by the town of Halai, was investigated at the Gavras plot. (ADelt 192-3) Atalante. Excavations in the town of Atalante revealed a number of remains dating from the HL to the LR period. These include part of a cistern of LR date, with a drainpipe; a piriform pottery kiln of LHL date; part of an anc. road, running E-W and lined by a terracotta drain, in use from HL to R times; a rec- tangular well, with pottery of the same date; and part of a building with a mosaic floor. The earliest occupation of the area dates to the PG period. (ADelt 190-2) Elateia. The Greek-avstrian excavations at the site of the cemetery of Elateia were continued, with the discovery of 16 new graves. Seven of those, concentrated in the NE part of the excavation, were rectangular pits with little or no offerings, dating to the R period, while a tomb, dated to the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD, was provided with a small court enclosed by a frail wall. Three Myc ChTs of the usual type were also excavated. (ADelt 196-8) Halai. The 2nd season of ASCS excavations in 1991 (ADelt 46, 198-9) was already reported in AR 1991-92, 40 (J. Coleman). John E. Coleman (ASCS) reports on the 1996 excavation: "Excavations by Cornell University resumed in the N levels at Halai in 1996, from June to avgust. Digging was concen- trated in area F. Excavation resumed in the main N exposure formerly opened and new trenches F12 and F13 were opened to link it with test trench Fl to the S. Brief explorations also took place in LR and HL levels in new trench F14 and in A levels in a new trench in area G adjacent to area F. By the end of the season we had excavated to water level in two places in the main N exposure and untangled the stratigraphy of many of the walls partly exposed in previous digging by our expedition and that of Goldman in the earlier part of this century. The large LN wall BL, which bisects the northern part of the N exposure, was tested and explored in great detail, although its use is still problematic. The N architectural remains, apart from wall BL, are all of domestic character. In MN times houses were tightly packed together in places, although there were also open spaces with hearths. A small bellows-like pot found in the remains of one hearth is of special interest; there is no evidence that it was used in metallurgy. Floors were renewed and ground level gradually rose within the houses. In general the stratigraphy now suggests that area F is located near the SW edge of the original N town. The N mound suffered erosion during the long period of abandonment of the site between N and A times and stones displaced from the walls of the latest N structures (dating to the initial, or Tsangli- Larissa stage of LN) came to form a band along its edge. In A times, on the other hand, the process was reversed: earth fill was piled against the edge of the mound to raise up ground level inside the now fortified SW comer of the site. Many radiocarbon samples were collected representing the full range of N occupation at Halai and a permit has since been granted by the Greek Archaeological Service to export them for analysis in the US. Permission has also been given to export the botanical samples collected in this and previous years so that Amy Bogaard may study them in England. Because of the historical changes in ground level, the strata available for exploration in trenches F12 and F13 were primarily of A date. A newly discovered wall, DC, that apparently bounded the A sanctuary had been thrown down to the S, almost certainly as a result of an earthquake. The small finds suggest that the destruction of wall DC took place at the time of the general destruction of the A sanctuary, which we would now date to the LA period, rather than as Goldman did to 426 BC. After the destruction a small rectangular building was constructed at a higher level. We could not determine the date of the building for certain because it had been previously excavated by Goldman; it probably dates to LA times, however, since it is identical in construction to securely dated LA buildings at the site. Back-filling continued in areas E and K and the work projected in our conservation plan for the site is about two- thirds complete. The back-filling operation is probably the most extensive ever carried out in Greece. We plan intensive study of the N finds from this and previous seasons of excavation in the summer of 1997. Further excavation now seems desirable for a full understanding of the historical development and a representative sample of the architecture of the N settlement (despite our earlier estimates that 1996 would be the final season of work in N levels)." Kynos. Excavations at the site of Pyrgos Livanaton were continued, for the clarification of the stratigraphical sequence. In the area N of the mud-brick wall and the kiln, successive destruction layers and architectural remains (floors) of the LH IIIB2 period, lying below LH IIIC levels, overlay parts of walls of LH IIIA1 date. The latter lay on a hard layer, with a few scattered MH sherds and two MH cist graves. In the area W of the pithos storerooms (ADelt 44, 171) a R building was discovered and eventually removed for safety reasons. The portable finds include craters with figured decoration, depicting sea battles, of the middle LH IIIC period, other pottery, figurines and some stone and bronze tools. (ADelt 194-5)</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 63 Modi-Skamna. Illegal excavations led to the excavation of two new ChTs, of the LH IIIB period, at the site of Skamna (ADelt 44, 173-5; 45, 175-6). In both cases the roof had col- lapsed. The chambers were of circular and rectangular plan, respectively, and contained one burial pit each; both had been looted in antiquity. (ADelt 193) Zeli-Golemi. Following repeated attempts at illegal excavations at the site of the Myc cemetery at Ag. Georgios (ADelt 43, 225ff; 44, 170-1), two more ChTs were investigated. One of the tombs, which had been looted, had a wide dromos, a built entrance and a rectangular chamber. The other, which was undisturbed, preserved a wide dromos, with a carefully constructed facade, and a rectangular chamber with its roof preserved. It contained six skeletons, laid on the floor in a contracted position, and offerings consisting of pottery and bronze jewellery, still worn by the dead. (ADelt 193-4) NORTHERN THESSALY Atrax. Many more inscriptions, funerary and votive and others, part of a female statuette, parts of marble basins, etc. (4th-2nd Ct BC) continue to be found during agricultural work here. One of the most interesting is AEML 91/48, on a stele, which records manumissions of slaves on three sides. Two sides are damaged, but the third fairly complete. (ADelt 222-5) Azoros, Elassona. From this locality were handed in two PG pots, a small piece of marble coffering with a miniature head in each of three square recesses, and a Ist-Ct AD votive stele displaying a stout eagle with open wings and above it the inscription: 'EpgoiKf;lg 'Y\iaTp / ev£adlvo; 8opov. (ADelt 226) Gelanthe (20km NW of Karditsa; 3.5km E of Gomphoi). An unusual and undamaged funerary stele of the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct AD, which may have come originally from anc. Gomphoi, was handed in to the 15th Ephorate by the Trikala police. In the upper part of the stele, a woman and child are carved within a deeply recessed arch. Immediately below are incised the personal possessions of the dead: a spindle, comb, mirror, basket, perfume flask and pyxis. Below these follows the four-line inscription: Kadaoavppo; Ap'E/g(b[v] Tirv eoaTo' / yuv(ai)Kac[v] gvinCri / Xdptv, and an incised Herm stele. (ADelt 225-6) Grevena. N. Wilkie reports on the 1991 season of the Grevena project, already covered in AR 1991-92, 41-2. (ADelt 227) Kalambaka: Theopetra Cave. (3km E of Kalambaka) N. Kyparissi-Apostolika covers the 1990-91 seasons in the report of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology in ADelt 529-32, and has an extended article on the Pal results in Archaiologia 60 (Sept. 1996, 37-41). The presence of a Mes stratum, clearly divided from earlier and later remains by sedimentary deposits, was confirmed by radiochronological tests. These gave dates between 9,781-8,353 and 7,034-6,704 BC; this is the first recognized occurrence of the Mes period in Thessaly. A contracted burial belonging to a late stage of this period (7,050-7,010 BC) was found in situ. The skeleton was a woman of 18-20 years. Another skeleton occurred in an Upper Pal level, but was badly disturbed by antiquities' thieves before it could be determined whether it was a burial or a chance occurrence. The bones gave a date of 14,620-14,380 BC, and the skeleton was that of an adult male. Clay interested the cave's inhabitants from at least the end of MPal, beginning of Upper Pal. They collected it in heaps, which were often of cylindrical form, and had obviously realized its plastic qualities. In Upper Pal strata the clay was often found near the remains of fire. Also in an Upper Pal level, burnt, more or less rounded shapes could be distinguished on a floor and in the sections, near remains of a fire set between three stones. These may represent containers of e.g. skin or wood which had burnt. Numerous stone tools of very good quality were found in all strata. Trenches near the E wall of the cave gave different results from those elsewhere and this area may have been used for different purposes. Here two deer teeth which had been drilled to form Upper Pal beads were found, plus another bone with nine incised parallel lines. In the lowest, MPal, levels in this area there were many bones of cave bears, amongst them whole jaws with the teeth intact. By contrast, animal bones were rare in MPal levels in the cave's centre. Both Upper Pal and Mes levels produced bones representing many animal species, and there was also evidence for a wide variety of plant life. To name only two, poppies were present in Upper Pal, and the wild almond in MPal. Krannon. Part of a HL mosaic floor was found during ploughing in the Koukoutara field, about 300m SE of the acropolis. Parts of the wall foundations of its chamber were found, and wall plaster decorated in red, blue, white and yellow had fallen onto the floor. Another room to the S had also had a mosaic, but it was almost totally destroyed. There were further building remains to the W and N of the mosaic, and a full-scale excavation was being planned. (ADelt 222) Krene (Pharsala). A small part of a LR or ECh mosaic floor was uncovered on the road leading to Pharsala from the village of Krene. The design appears to have consisted of foliate motifs surrounded by an inner border of small crosses within star motifs. No other evidence of building remains was found, but the abundant R and Byz pottery in the nearby fields betrays the presence here of a settlement. (ADelt 242) Larisa. At the corer of 31 avgoustou and Papadiamante, a mechanical excavator digging a ditch for a sewerage pipe hit a mosaic which proved to be about 60 m2in extent, and had probably decorated the triclinium of a large private house. Amongst its decorative elements, executed in tesserae of 20 different colours, were a central bust of Dionysos, and three of the four seasons, represented as female busts, accompanied by appropriate symbols and inscriptions. The fourth, Winter, was unfortunately destroyed by the machine, as were two out of eight square border panels with a theme of various comestibles in 'still-life' form. The mosaic is one of four so far found which are recognizable as creations of a Larisa workshop apparently specializing in Dionysos and in one other subject, the seasons. It is provisionally dated to the end of the 4th Ct AD. The mosaic was lifted and taken to Larisa museum. In a plot on the corner of Ypselantou and Byzantiou, part of the extensive S cemetery of anc. Larisa was found. Unfortunately machinery digging foundations destroyed five clay larakes, five open burials, two cist tombs and six tile graves, but objects collected afterwards dated from the</page><page sequence="64">64 DAVID BLACKMAN beginning of the 3rd to the end of the 1st Cts BC. The S cemetery as a whole was used from the 4th Ct BC to LR. Part of the extensive E cemetery of anc. Larisa's acropolis was found during foundation digging in a plot at Thessalonikes 163 and Ypselantou. The main tomb here was a marble cist grave. Its exterior was rough, but its interior was carefully polished and each slab was decorated with a rectangular frame of double lines, which on the long sides was divided into two parts by an engraved column. It contained a skeleton and an iron nail, and is provisionally dated to the LHL period by the tomb type, known elsewhere in the vicinity. Fragments of destroyed tile graves were also found. A cist grave with similarly worked slabs was found at the cross-roads of 31 avgoustou and Helladiou, but in this case they were in secondary use, as one end and the floor of the tomb were of square bricks. It contained only a poorly preserved skeleton with its head to the W. There was a similar but destroyed tomb about 20m to the N. They were possibly EByz. Eight inscribed funerary steles or parts thereof and one votive were handed in to the Archaeological Service. The date range is 4th-lst Cts BC. (ADelt 219-22, 226-7) Part of the EByz fortification walls of Larisa have been uncovered on Odos Philellenon, indicating abundant use of spolia from the nearby theatre and ECh monuments. (ADelt 241) Megalo Monasteri and the Pal Survey. Curtis Runnels (ASCS) reports on the 1991 season, already covered in AR 1991-92, 41. (ADelt 227-8) Mount Chassia Survey. L. Darmezin of the French School presents the survey's results in 1991, already covered briefly in AR 1991-92, 42. (ADelt 228-9) Pharsala (Eretria community). At Palioklesi about 150m S of Asprogeia village, road and levelling works located a MBA cemetery. Six cist tombs were excavated, three with long stone side slabs projecting beyond their end slabs, two with their long sides built of unworked stones, and one almost completely destroyed. Each contained one or two contracted burials. Finds included a kantharos with high-swung strap handles and other MH pots. (ADelt 222) CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessalonike (work of the PR and C Ephorate): Within the walls, above Egnatia Street. Agora. From 1990 the Archaeological Service and the Aristotelion University of Thessalonike have been working on a combined excavation, conservation and restoration pro- gramme here with the object of opening the area to the public. It is estimated that the agora covered about two acres in the centre of the R city. It was set out around a rectangular paved square 146m in length. There were stoas with double colon- nades and rooms at the back on three sides. Access to them was apparently controlled, as marble panels closed the spaces between the columns except in certain places (as at the E end of the S stoa) where there were probably doors. The double cryptoporticus under the S stoa served as a necessary foundation for that stoa because of the downward slope of the area, and also acted as a retaining wall for the levelling fill of the central paved square. On the S side of the cryptoporticus, part of a marble-paved road was found, which, together with its footpath, would have been 2.30m wide. The R agora had no predecessor on the site, which in the HL period was used for the extraction and preparation of clay and other raw materials; a HL well and a metal furnace for preparing coin blanks were also found in earlier strata in the NE of the area. The site probably first started to be organized as a centre of civic life in the 1st Ct AD, and was improved and embellished in the Antonine period. The dominant structure on the E side, the odeion, had an earlier phase in the 2nd Ct AD when it may have been a bouleuterion. It probably became a 400-seat odeion in the first half of the 3rd Ct AD. An attempt to extend it and convert it into a 3000-seat theatre, most likely early in the 4th Ct AD, was apparently not completed. Immediately N of the odeion, part of a three-aisled building of a religious character was discovered. In the ECh period, the area reverted to its original use. All the rooms and spaces round the odeion were then used as rain-water cisterns, and once again there were workshops for preparing clay, lime and also metal. (ADelt 275; J. Vokotopoulou, P. Adam-Veleni, AEMTH 7, 321-5). A well-preserved part of the cryptoporticus was found W of the agora at Karbola 8. (ADelt 275) Plateia Kyprion Agoniston (formerly Plateia Dioiketeriou). Because of plans for a four-storey underground car park here, after the 9th Byzantine Ephorate had excavated the later levels, in 1991 the 16th Ephorate investigated the lower strata where possible. HL building remains were founded on virgin soil. A Ist-Ct AD building phase succeeded, notable for the quality of its terra sigillata pottery, both local and imported. Buildings of the 2nd-4th Cts AD became increasingly imposing, and still stand 2m high in parts. A well-preserved bronze medallion of Athena and four animal protomes, all chariot decorations, were found in a Ist-Ct BC stratum. (ADelt 276) In 1993, in nightmare conditions surrounded by earth- moving machinery, staff of both the Byz and the Prehistoric and Classical Ephorates of Thessalonike worked heroically to salvage as much information as possible in this area, only one block W of the agora, and close to a known area of sanctuaries. Remains of all periods from HL to recent were found, of which the most imposing were: 1. part of R baths in Ag. Demetriou near its junction with Papageorgiou with LByz dwellings above; two parts of very large, imposing, probably public ECh baths, the N part near the SW corer of the Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace and the S part on the S side of Ag. Demetriou. 2. all along the W side of the square itself, a R road 4.5m wide with a dense water-supply and drainage network with successive repairs and phases from R to modem. 3. E of this a very large ECh building, with nine identified areas, one with a mosaic floor, and another, the largest, probably a courtyard, with a built fountain in the middle. This building, of the 4th Ct AD but in use for a long period, was founded on earlier R and late HL phases. On the E side of the square was a destruction level which could not be fully interpreted in the circumstances; from this area a notable find was a 1st Ct BC marble head of an Aphrodite of the Knidian type. Because of the site's obvious importance, work on the car park was eventually stopped (A. Tasia, AEMTH 7, 329-337; I. Kanonidis, AEMTH 7, 343-9). Part of a large, well-preserved R cistern was found at Plateia Kyprion Agoniston 7-9. A little HL and ER pottery was recovered from the plot's lower strata, but most was LR, ECh and EByz (ADelt 277).</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 65 At Krystalle 17, part of an early R building founded on a fill with LHL and ER pottery was excavated. It was cut through by 3rd-Ct AD pits and wells. (D. Kousoulakou, AEMTH 6, 305-7) At Euripidou 17, below remains of many periods from Byz onwards, two HL building phases were discovered, one EHL and one 2nd-Ct BC. The walls were reused as foundations in the R period. (ADelt 277) A plot at Kassandrou 90 contained successive building phases from HL onwards, including a handsome LR/ECh house with mosaic floors, frescoed walls and its own baths. After its abandonment, two 7th-Ct AD tombs were dug into the area's bedrock. Then followed a MByz chapel (funerary) with one wall preserving remains of a fresco with decorated crosses and inscriptions, and tombs of the 13th-15th Cts AD. 14th-Ct AD fresco fragments had fallen into the fill of some of these, suggesting a major church in the vicinity. (D. Makropoulou and A. Tzitzibassi in AEMTH 7, 355-67) Chortiate stoa (between Metropolitou Gennadiou, Egnatia and Menelaou). E. Marki amalgamates and interprets the results of four different rescue excavations in the central city block immediately E of Plateia Dikasteriou. The area had some HL and earlier R building remains and finds suggest a possible shrine. The main interest centres on a large LR/ECh villa urbana and its many alterations, destructions, and the incorpora- tion of some of its surviving parts into later buildings, such as a funerary chapel belonging to a monastery identified as that of the Prodromos. When this had to be abandoned at the beginning of the Ott period, the next buildings in the area were the Souleiman Tzami, burnt down in the 1917 fire, followed by the Chortiate stoa built in 1922, now vanished in its turn. In this microcosm of the history of Thessalonike, conflagrations and earthquakes figure prominently. (AEMTH 6, 327-34) Within the walls, below Egnatia Street. Two well-preserved EByz building phases of 5th and 6th/7th Cts AD, found in a building plot at Loue 5, would have been built in the open area within the LR 'theatre called Stadium' which by then would have been disused. (ADelt 275-6) Th. Stefanidou-Tiveriou uses previously unpublished records to show that the well-known Small Arch of Galerius was found by Ch. Makaronas in 1957 in a rescue excavation at Isauron 5 (S of the visible remains of Galerius' palace; immediately N of and parallel with Tsimiski). The arch had once framed a niche in which a statue would have been set. The niche was in the N end of the E wall of the E stoa of a large peristyle building which preceded the construction of the Octagon. It was also just S of and on the E side of a large doorway (4.50m wide) which lined up with the monumental entrance on the S side of the palace, suggesting a corridor connecting the two. This corridor may well have extended to the S to the harbour entrance to the whole complex, in which case the niche and its arch were on one of the main arterial thoroughfares of the palace. (AEMTH 6, 295-302) Part of the sea wall of the city was found at Kalapothake 3. Three building phases-ECh, Byz and (?)postByz-were recognized. (D. Nalpandis, AEMTH 6, 321-2) Outside the walls. W Cemetery. At Apolloniados 13, 17 ECh tombs of the 4th-6th Cts AD were excavated. One vaulted tomb had wall paintings. A 6th-Ct AD building was founded above the tombs. The plot was again used as a cemetery in the Ott period. (D. Nalpandis, AEMTH 6, 311-21) N settlement. M. Pappa reports on this surprising find in the grounds of Thessalonike's International Fair. Under the old Luna Park, now the site of the new conference centre, and beneath the HL to moder remains below it, a greyish-brown stratum some 800m2in extent contained MN and LN material. It had been much cut into by later tombs and foundations, and the only structures found were pits of various kinds. Most contained domestic refuse (building material, sherds, stone tools, shells and animal bone), but in one was the skeleton of a mature female, buried there with scant ceremony; another, isolated pit held only pestles and mortars. (AEMTH 7, 303-7) E Cemetery. In 1992-3, in the NE angle of the International Fair grounds, 260 HL to ECh graves were excavated: tile graves, pit and cist graves and burials in pots. Many of the tile graves were without grave goods. Cist graves were of many types, and some were used for multiple burials, including one which had two superimposed floors. HL graves at a lower level were rectangular shafts in the earth, lightly plastered, with cuttings to receive a wooden bier or coffin. These had rich grave goods, and dated to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. (D. Koussoulakou, AEMTH 6, 307-8; 7, 311-15) E.S. Pelekanidou reports on excavations in the N part of the Evangelistria Cemetery (N part of the anc. E cemetery), which began in 1991. 159 tombs (mostly LR/ECh) were excavated. They were of many types: tile graves, pit graves, cist graves lined with brick, plaster or marble and also simple burials laid out on the ground. Three tombs had altars built over them. The many grave goods included pottery (much of it intact), glass vessels, lamps, figurines, and jewellery. After this part of the cemetery had ceased to be used, an ECh building complex was constructed. The part excavated included a processional way, 4m wide and contained by walls on either side. A 65m length of it was tested from its built S end. Most of it had probably been paved with plain marble slabs, but at its N end, where it was stepped to accommodate the steeper slope, it was floored with two mosaics on different levels. The N one had a design of linked circles containing curvilinear abstract designs, and the S one, birds, animals and baskets of fruit in medallions. This section had apparently been roofed, and there was ample evidence of its destruction by fire. To the E of the mosaics was a large area, again on two different levels joined by steps, which had been paved in marble and was probably open. The mosaics date to the first half of the 6th Ct AD, while the few associated sherds are not later than the 7th Ct AD. This most unusual building complex is interpreted as the processional way to a possible martyrion, which, because of the area's unchanged topography, should now lie under the Agios Demetrios hospital. It may have been burned down during the (unsuccessful) siege of Thessalonike by the Avars and Slavs, probably in AD 618, when chronicles record that the barbarians burned all the churches and dwellings outside the city walls. (AEMTH 7, 373-81) Suburbs. Ano Toumba: the Table. K. Soueref continued his work on the Table in 1991-93, investigating 10 building plots in these years. Most give a consistent picture of C and A settlement remains on an organized street plan, above IA fill. The plot at Elaias 13 was notable for imported pottery amongst the local wares, Euboean in the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC and A and C Attic sherds. The last phase at Dryos 9, on the W edge of the settlement, was later than usual, probably finishing late in the second half of the 4th Ct BC. It consisted of parts of three houses with</page><page sequence="66">66 DAVID BLACKMAN streets between. Many of their rooms were sealed by a destruction level with fallen tiles. Floor surfaces were well preserved, and the use of many rooms could be determined from the finds: a store-room, a room for preparing food (hand- mills), the remains of a warp-weighted loom in a room corer, a kitchen, a dining-room which still preserved whole pots, paved yards and a possible shrine. There were various earlier phases here, the earliest being EIA. Still earlier remains were found at Dryos 10, where a building phase directly above the stereo contained LBA and SMyc pottery, datable to the 11th Ct BC. This phase showed similarities to the third phase on the Toumba itself; 9th and 8th Ct BC phases found here may be the equivalent of Toumba's second phase, while a basically 7th Ct BC phase in the plot, marked by curious beehive-shaped (?)storage structures, is equated with Toumba's first phase, in which such installations were also found. This implies that in the llth-7th Cts BC the settlement here not only occupied the Toumba but extended over at least part of the table. It is unknown whether Dryos 10 had remains later than the 7th-6th Cts BC as its upper strata had been destroyed. (ADelt 277-8; AEMTH 6, 273-84; 7, 287-96) The Toumba. The University of Thessalonike's archaeology department has had an excavation here since 1986, under the general direction of Prof. G. Chourmouziadis. The joint reports of K. Kotsakis and S. Andreou on the 1992 and 1993 seasons are chiefly concerned with a large building complex on the summit and its surroundings. The complex is ca 20 x 15m and consists of an apsidal structure with up to five rooms or spaces oriented NE-SW with the apse to the SW, which has a further seven or eight fairly rectangular rooms or other areas joined to its long SE side. This was occupied during three of the site's phases: phase 5, which can be dated to LH IIIB or the beginning of LH IIIC; and phases 4 and 3, which cover the period from the end of the 12th to the beginning of the 10th Cts BC. Although much LH IIIC pottery (mostly fine table-ware) has been found, it is in the minority, and local wares predominate, especially in storage and domestic pottery. This building complex was surrounded by roads on all sides, and in a shallow hollow in the road on the N side was an unexpected phase 3 burial of a young woman accompanied by a spindle whorl, a clay button, a boar's tusk and a hand-made jug. To the W, S and E of the building complex, on the other side of the road, parts of buildings of the same phases were found, but with their floors at a lower level. This and other evidence proves that this part of the Toumba was built on a series of descending embankments at this period. (AEMTH 6, 259-70; 7, 279-84) Lembet. The landmark Lembet Toumba in the NW suburb of Polichne was continuously occupied from EBA to LIA. A building plot at S. Venizelou 30 provided a welcome opportu- nity for a systematic investigation from the top of its much built-over table. The earliest material, in two pits cut into the stereo, was EIA. Above them, five building phases ranged in date from the 9th to the 4th Cts BC. Most pottery of all phases was local, but there were a few sherds from imported Euboean pots in the later 8th Ct BC. (K. Tzanavari-A. Lioutas, AEMTH 7, 265-73) Thessalonike (Work of the Byz Ephorates): AEMTH 7 reports (367): "The rescue dig on the building plot at 90 Kassandrou St brought to light a large section of a house of the 3rd to early 7th Ct with mosaic floors, wall paintings, and a small bathroom, together with traces of another house, contemporary with, and just E of the first. After this second house was abandoned, the site was used for burials. A chapel, probably funerary, dates from the MByz period, and one of its walls is decorated with a fresco of three gemmed crosses with columns between them, and some inscriptions. The excavators offer a reconstruction of the fresco, and date it to the 9th Ct, suggesting that it may be iconoclast.(363) Twenty-four barrel-vaulted and cist graves belong to a 13th -15th Ct cemetery. Fragments of 14th Ct frescoes with religious themes found in the fill of some of the graves come from an unknown church in the vicinity. The church and cemetery were in the Asomati district of the Byz period." More information on the R agora excavations is reported in AEMTH 7, 321. Likewise further investigations in 1991 in the East Cemetery (AEMTH 7, 373) uncovered buildings with mosaic floors (animal and foliate motifs), burnt traces of wall paintings, 158 burials including vaulted and cist tombs, and a wide range of lamps, pottery and glass vessels (many intact) and private jewellery items, all dating from the LR period. Three impressive funerary monuments were also uncovered and are discussed at length. These were R-LR in date but not Ch. Figurines included a small rock crystal figurine of Tillapia Nilotica, the fish venerated as Mother-Sun goddess in Egypt. A long impressively built open corridor appears to have led to a grand funerary monument (martyrium?) and is considered by the excavator as unique. A destruction phase of the 7th Ct (Slavo-Avar siege?) is suggested by sherds. The major rescue excavations in Diikitiriou Square in 1993 are reported in AEMTH 7, 349: "To the E of a section of a LR road, a mid-4th Ct ECh building on top of the late HL and R phases was gradually explored. The moveable finds indicate that it was used for a very long time. Excavations have so far revealed nine rooms, one of them with a mosaic floor and another, the largest (probably unroofed), with a built fountain in the centre." Remains of Byz private dwellings and an impressive ECh bath complex were located in small excavations in nearby locations. Nome of Thessalonike Agios Athanasios. A Macedonian tomb (NW of the village of the same name, situated just beyond the cross-roads to Pella and Evzoni) which was excavated in 1966, remained subject to such constant damage by antiquities' thieves, that it became necessary to investigate the whole area. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti reports on seasons in late 1992 and early 1993. The Macedonian tomb had had a rock-cut downward-sloping path and a trapezoidal yard in front of its facade. What remained of its mound was found to cover part of an extensive cemetery, which was probably connected with the nearby settlement mound of Toptsin or Gefphyra, known for surface indications of LN-HL. Of the 29 tombs investigated, 21 were 6th-Ct AD, mostly from its 2nd half, and the rest 4th-Ct BC or later. The latest, containing only a 2nd-Ct BC lamp, re-used the already-existing pit of an earlier, probably EIA burial, represented by a long pin and a heavy single-spiral bracelet, both bronze. The A graves have much in common with the cemeteries at nearby Sindos and at Agia Paraskeve. Male burials had heads to the W, two spears on the left side, an iron sword in the right hand, and one or more iron knives; only one had an Illyrian helmet. Female graves usually had iron jewellery, though there were a few gold mouthpieces and gold leaf rosettes; one had a faience aryballos in the form of a hedgehog. Imported A pottery of excellent quality was Cor, Attic and Ionic; it included two Chiot chalices with sphinxes. Local</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 pottery was also used. Two 4th-Ct BC tombs retained gilded clay decorations from the wooden biers, which in one case had come from a panel showing Arimaspians fighting griffins. A large (twice-robbed) cist grave had a false facade of unfired bricks painted with a Doric entablature, evidently imitating a Macedonian tomb. (AEMTH 6, 369-77; 7, 251-9) M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti also excavated the Macedonian tomb referred to in AR 1994-95, 45 ('Sindos: Toumba Agios Athanasios'). It has now been used as the subject of a calendar by the Organization for the Cultural Capital of Europe Thessalonike 1997, with an introduction by the archaeologist. The tomb, which had a single chamber, had been robbed, but its painted facade is largely preserved. The calendar has a colour reproduction of the frieze above the lintel in twelve sections. It shows a torch-light procession on the left, a symposium in the centre, and soldiers in unusual helmets standing on the right. There are four other colour reproduc- tions, including one of the mound in its original condition. Apollonia. Continual destruction by antiquities' thieves required a rescue excavation here, which defined the extent of the HL settlement and the cemetery. Seven cist tombs, all previously robbed and much damaged, were cleared. Three tests in the settlement uncovered private dwellings. One of them retained the foundation for a mosaic floor, but the mosaic itself had been destroyed by the plough, as the anc. remains are only 0.30m below the surface. (ADelt 281) Anc. Arethousa (S of the main road through the Rendina Pass at the E end of Lake Volvi). The illegal construction of a fire-break road damaged part of the cemetery and N fortifica- tion wall of this hill-top site, necessitating rescue excavation in which 129 graves (tile graves, pit graves, cremations) were found, dating from the mid-4th to mid-2nd Cts BC. Finds included bg and plain pottery, jewellery (mainly bronze and iron), strigils, coins, and, in children's graves, terracotta figurines. No weapons were found. A trial trench uncovered a 5.30m length of the W fortification wall and the foundation of a circular tower, provisionally dated LC. Earlier occupation of the area may have been on the neighbouring hill with the Byz fortress, where A and C finds have been made. S. Moschonesioti includes an interesting summary of the myths, traditions and written sources connected with anc. Arethousa in her account of the excavation. (AEMTH 6,406-11) Kalamoto (anc. Kalindoia): Toumbes. (2km S of the village; 7km SE of Zangliveri; 12km S of Lake Volvi). K. Sismanidis and A. Keramaris report on tests on the small toumba and the large table here, and in the surrounding area. On the small toumba N pits and EBA, LIA and LHL building phases were found. Stratigraphy on the large table was much disturbed, with mixed C to R sherds, then C-HL, but without building remains. Storage pits were cut into the stereo. A third test which was opened 150m N of the mounds had 1st Ct BC building remains. In this area E. Brozo had found and handed in the lower part of an votive stele, inscribed: ZTPATTQ APIAAIOY / AHMHTPI KAT'EIlITArHN. Ch. Brozo also found part of a marble statue of a boy with a bird in the same area. (ADelt 293; AEMTH 6, 395-400) Langadas Survey. K. Kotsakis and S. Andreou report the results of the 5th season of this University of Thessalonike survey. Fieldwork took place in the hill country behind Lete on the SW side of the valley, and in the area round Pente Vryses on the NE side. Eighteen sites were found, 16 of them previ- ously unknown. They were of all periods from LN to Ott, with the curious exception of MByz. Study of material from previous periods confirms the lack of MByz in all areas so far covered, an interesting historical enigma. The presence of two small LN sites in the semi-mountainous Pente Vryses area was unexpected, as it has been generally accepted that N settlement in Macedonia was confined to the plains. Another surprising result was the apparent absence of the remains of any A-C city which could be anc. Lete, and it is suggested that the city may not have been a single large centre, as in S Greece, but a united group of villages. Relevant to this is the fact that the first recognizable city centres in the Langadas area belong to post-C periods. Interesting results were obtained by drilling at some sites, as at the LN/EBA mound at Kavalari to the W of Lake Koronia. The N settlement here proved to be far greater in extent than the small toumba alone, but had been covered by ca 3m of alluvium. (AEMTH 6, 349-56) Lete. The Donate Plot near the road from the modem village to Langadas produced HL sherds and slight building remains not necessarily of that period. (ADelt 281) Mesemeriane Toumba (near Trilophos, ca 16km S of Thessalonike). This site is well-known for its MN surface pottery which is the earliest in central Macedonia. The toumba is founded on a N settlement which may have covered ca 60 str. The site has not suffered serious soil erosion or other damage, and the surface sherds suggest continuous habitation. D. Grammenos and K. Skourtopoulou report on a plan to examine the mound by means of a stepped series of 3m deep tests to bedrock. The first test, on the top of the toumba, was begun in 1992 and reached G and IA remains. (AEMTH 6,339-45) Nea Anchialos. Prof. M. Tiberios of Thessalonike University's Archaeology Department continued his tests on the double table of Anchialos in 1992-93 (the tables are in a military zone and only limited testing is possible). Trench A, near the SW edge of the S table, reached sterile sand about 10m below ground level. Immediately above this was transported soil containing mixed LN and LBA sherds. This formed the ground level for the earliest habitation on this area of the mound, which was LBA. An interesting LBA oven was found in this trench. Its fire-box was well preserved, but its upper structure apparently had to be re-built every time it was used. Joined to it was an auxilary installation, perhaps for heating water; on it the greater part of a cooking pot was found in situ. The oven was founded on one of the clay embankments which are a feature of the site. Trench B, near the N edge of the S table, provided good evidence for the construction of one of these embankments, provisionally dated to the IA. The layers of clean yellow clay were interspersed with occasional levels of brown mud-brick, and in one case, pithos sherds. There were also layers of sandy gravel, the probable purpose of which was to keep the clay well-drained. In one part, tree-trunks of various sizes had been placed below the last layer of gravel. In 1992 a military excavating machine fell into a pit on the E edge of the lower, N table, the contents of which required unscheduled investigation. The pit proved both large and deep, and was filled by a very rich and varied collection of sherds, mainly of the 5th and 4th Cts BC, and other domestic objects and remains. The pottery was of settlement rather than funerary type, and the deposit had been made in the late 4th Ct BC, as sherds of this date were scattered throughout the fill to the bottom. As this is the period of Thessalonike's foundation, the inhabitants may have left their mound to take part in the synoecism. In 1993 four tests were excavated near this pit to check for any contemporary buildings, but the occupation levels found 67</page><page sequence="68">68 DAVID BLACKMAN were PG/G. Another refuse pit was discovered, this time of the early 5th Ct BC and filled mainly with amphora sherds. The date of this pit coincides well with Xerxes' invasion. It seems that while in the G period the settlement covered both tables, it afterwards retracted to the S table (which is therefore somewhat the higher), while the N table was used for the disposal of rubbish. The Anchialos settlement is thought to be anc. Sindos. (AEMTH 6, 357-65; 7, 243-8) Ossa (15km NE of Langadas). Work on this small LC-HL town on the borders of anc. Mygdonia and Bisaltia continued in 1991-92. P. Adam-Veleni and E. Ioannidou describe the excavation of the basements of private houses, used for the storage of provisions in pithoi and for work areas, as indicated by the presence of hand-mills and ovens. There was clear evidence that the living areas had been on upper floors, where there had been looms and small family shrines. Finds generally represented the 4th-lst Cts BC, and pottery study, combined with stratigraphy, distinguished four strata spanning the end of the 3rd to the 1st Cts BC. M. Mangafa reports on archaeobotanical remains from four soil samples from the 2nd HL phase. Species recovered included einkorn, hulled barley, millet, lentils, grape, fig and various wild plants, and seemed to represent crop-processing activities such as fine sieving and hand picking, but the paucity of remains did not permit a reconstruction of the agricultural economy of the settlement. (ADelt 281; AEMTH 6, 383-90) Thermi. The anc. cemetery here seems to occupy the whole length of the present settlement. By 1991 382 tombs with a date range of 8th to 4th Cts BC had been discovered. In a plot at the junction of Makedonias and Eirenes, K. Lazaridi excavated 42 tombs and a rubbish pit dated EIA-A. Thirty-eight of the tombs were pits of various kinds, two were stone slab cists, there was one enchytrismos and one destroyed pithos burial. Males were buried with heads to the W, females with heads to the E. More than half the burials were those of children, and contained jewellery (mainly bronze; plus beads of bone and glass paste). One had gold earrings, a gold mouthpiece and a large spectacle fibula. All the children's burials had sea shells and small black stones like counters, perhaps from some game. One of the cist tombs had a female burial and, though robbed, still contained a matching pair of Cor exaleiptra, a bg pyxis, and bronze jewellery: seven fibulae, four bracelets, two rings, two pins; also two necklaces with bone or glass paste beads, and a bone ring. The rubbish pit contained much pottery, signs of much burning and few bones. In another plot at Ethnikes Antistaseos 13, an A poros sarcophagus was found. It contained a bronze Illyrian helmet, a gold mouthpiece, a silver fibula, an iron sword and a sickle-shaped iron knife, a bronze cauldron, a skyphos-type pot and a jug, and, between the skeleton's legs, the iron framework of a small two-wheeled cart with remains of wood, like those found in tombs at Sindos and Pydna. (ADelt 280-1). Vrasna (21km SW of Amphipolis). When an inscription handed in proved to be one of the oldest so far found in Macedonia, P. Adam-Veleni undertook a rescue excavation in the area where it was found. This was a hill in a position commanding the Strymonic Gulf and the road emerging from the Rendina pass and leading to Thrace. On the hill was a fort, and the early inscription had been built into its circuit wall, which had been five-sided and enclosed an area of ca 4 str. It had three towers, two with one internal chamber, and one unusual one with two chambers, entered by a marble staircase. There were also rooms within the circuit, in one of which were an oil press and a stone drainage channel. The superstructure of the circuit wall had presumably been of mud brick, protected by Laconian tiles. Many of them had stamps which proved the public character of the fort, for they carried the names of police officials. The majority had the inscription AITYNOMQN OOYPIIIInOY AHMHTPIOY, two had AITYNOM,QN fIATPOKAEOYX IHPO ENOY and others had initials. This is the first evidence for the institution of police in Macedonia. Two building phases were recognized in the fort, which was in use from the 4th Ct BC until 168 BC, when it was destroyed by the Romans. (AEMTH 6,415-21) Nome of Kilkis Axioupolis (formerly Bohemitsa). Th. Savvopoulou publishes two IA bronze anchor-shaped pendants with bird finials and triple pendants which were found during excava- tions for a water supply pipe lkm N of the town. She discusses comparative material and the wider geographical and archaeo- logical background. (AAA 21, 90-101) Evropos (ca 10km S of Axioupolis). With the financial support, encouragement, help and co-operation of the local authorities, work continued at Evropos in 1991-92, directed by Th. Savvopoulou and M. Valla. A test in the acropolis area reached the latest three building phases of the town, all LR. The street grid and even plans of individual buildings were impressively clear on maps produced by a team from the Geophysics Department of the University of Thessalonike, headed by Prof. G. Tsoka. Tests in areas where the geophysical survey showed striking magnetic anomalies uncovered a large rectangular kiln and a double-chambered vaulted tomb. No pottery was found in the kiln, but in its praefurnium amongst the debris from its fallen ceiling were two strange little apotropaic figurines. The tomb had been robbed, but could be dated by coins and crosses to the reign of Justinian. Another vaulted tomb and various tile graves and plain burials were in the same trench. Somewhat S of this the 1991 excavation had located another vaulted tomb with an ante-chamber with a short flight of stairs in it. It was surrounded by a peribolos, which was apsidal at the E end. It may have been a ECh hero6n-martyrion. The tomb was robbed, but in the main chamber were the disturbed bones of five skeletons, while two more had been in the ante-chamber. A bronze pyxis, a gilded cross-shaped brooch, a gold link and a broken glass vessel were also found. The installation of a water supply pipe through part of the anc. cemetery located a further 30 graves (including six cremations) from late 4th Ct BC to LR, as well as other features. A ditch for a new sewerage pipe near the mod. cemetery encountered a group of R tile graves and one plain burial of the late 5th/early 4th Cts BC (dated by pottery and jewellery). A monumental cist tomb of the first half of the 3rd Ct BC, with gabled cover slabs and a plastered and painted interior contained two burials which had been laid on a decorated bier. The burial had been disturbed, but much remained, including gold thread, the usual gilded wreaths, many vases including a kantharos decorated in West Slope style, and a gold bracelet ending in goats' heads. (ADelt 290-2, AEMTH 6,433-9) Palaio Gynaikokastro. A new exhibition displaying the EIA finds from this site was opened in 1991. The attractive presentation includes reconstructions of some of the tombs, and other EIA finds from older excavations. (ADelt 275) Palatianos. I. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolychroni describes the construction of plaster copies of the original statues from the known 2nd Ct AD Heroon at this site, which may be anc. Ioron, and their installation in the Heroon. Excavation was begun on another peribolos N of the latter, which had a row of</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 69 three rooms along its W wall. From one of these came the mould for the Bes figurine (AR 1995-96, 27). Much work remained to be done, and the building's function was uncertain. Most of the material from it was 1 st Ct BC-1 st Ct AD, but there were tombs of end Ist/early 2nd and 4th Cts AD within it. (AEMTH 7, 389-393) Toumba Paionias (ca 6km S of Axioupolis). About 30m from the known Macedonian tomb is a second tumulus. Its excavation by Th. Savvopoulou showed that it covered a large, looted cist tomb, which had contained a male burial. Amongst its destroyed contents were fragments of pots, alabastra, iron strigils and a gilded bronze wreath with clay berries. Decorations from a bier included five small heads. A small sheet of gold leaf was inscribed BOTTAKOS, probably the name of the deceased. A stratigraphical test in the tumulus fill found remains of funerary ceremonies at two different levels. The first, about a metre above the cist, was a brick construction which had sherds of a late 4th-Ct BC amphora on it as well as burnt bones and shells. The second, a metre higher and later, consisted of a rf pelike set upside down on a flat level of pebbles. It had a hole in its base and was obviously intended to receive libations. Next to it were another gilded bronze wreath, and a decayed bronze coin. (AEMTH 6, 425-8) Nome of Chalkidike Agios Mamas. The excavation of a telephone company cable ditch led to the discovery of the first EBA cemetery in Macedonia. M. Pappa reports that the graves were just W of the known LN-EBA mound (S of the main road from Nea Moudania, opposite the turn-off to Nea Olynthos village). Fifteen graves of three types were excavated. The first type consisted of pithoi laid on their sides in shallow pits and bounded by stones. They contained contracted burials. Almost all had grave goods, either pots or bronze jewellery, usually within the pithoi, but in one instance placed just outside the mouth. Inside one of the small pots were found 25 faience beads, probably the earliest occurrence in Macedonia. The pithoi themselves were of interest, most having wiped surfaces and applied decorated bands, but usually only their lower side had survived. The skeletons also were in poor condition. In the second group of graves the dead were laid in a contracted position on a floor of thickly-packed pebbles. In one case the body was covered with pithos sherds and in the other by a stone slab; this tomb too was outlined by stones. There was only one example of the third tomb type which consisted of a pithos-type vessel laid on a pebble floor and framed by stones and schist slabs. In the pot were the cremated bones of an infant. The tomb was covered by sherds with incised decoration. The area was used again as a cemetery in the LR period. There were built cists, tile graves and pit graves, dated by coins to the 2nd-3rd Cts AD. Grave goods included pots (many with a hole cut in them after firing), jewellery and figurines. The architectural members, sculpture and funerary steles in secondary use in the built tombs are of interest. The EBA cemetery is obviously connected with the settlement on the Agios Mamas mound, but it is unknown to which town the R cemetery belonged. (AEMTH 6, 475-80) Galatista (18km NW of Polygyros). In the place known as Prinochori, G. Kakarikas found a R marble funerary stele with a male bust within a rectangular frame and a three-line inscription below. (ADelt 293) lerissos (anc. Akanthos) E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou and her assistants continued their work on the enormous cemetery here. In 1991 three more building plots and part of a fourth contained another 582 graves, bringing the total number to 6,363. They were of all types: pit graves, cist graves, tile graves, larakes, pithoi and a large number of child-burials in amphoras. The date range was EA-R. During ditch-digging for a major drainage project, a monumental sculptured funerary stele came to light. It showed two opposed seated male figures, a young man (the original deceased) on the left, and an older bearded man on the right. The aetoma depicted a lion, the symbol on the city's coinage. This and the monumental nature of the stele suggested that the deceased was an important citizen. The inscription indicated that the stele was used for two burials at different times. It is dated to the end of the 5th/early 4th Cts BC, and was carved in Thasian marble, probably the work of a north Greek sculptor. The same archaeologist writes on the results of the 1993 season, when a further three plots produced another 644 tombs. At the end of this season, burials totalled 7,839 and the finds were numbered by tens of thousands. At least 50 % of graves contained child burials, and these were usually lavishly supplied with grave goods. In the late 7th/early 6th Cts BC these almost always included ECor alabastra or local imitations thereof. In the 6th and early 5th Cts BC, Attic vases predominated. Particularly notable finds in 1993 included the bases of two funerary monuments, a larax of the Clazomenian type, and human remains in a simple pit grave, without grave goods, but with double iron shackles round the ankles. New evidence for the early history of anc. Akanthos came to light in the excavation by the 10th Byz Ephorate on the Byz basilica dedicated to the Birth of the Virgin in the centre of the anc. site. A semi-circular stone structure was encountered 2.50m below the surface, and in its fill were PR sherds, chiefly EIA, but some BA. (ADelt 289-90, AEMTH 7,413-16) Koukos, Sykia. J. Carington Smith and J. Vokotopoulou report on the 1992 season at this EIA site, already covered in AR 1992-93, 54. (AEMTH 6,495-9) Anc. Mekyberna. When new harbour works were proposed here in connection with the summer resort settlement 'Akte Mekyberna' which is immediately E of the anc. mound, a team from the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, led by F.K. (Demetrios) Chaniotes set out to locate and record any anc. harbour remains, as Mekyberna has long been held to be the port of anc. Olynthos, 6km to the NW. An underwater structure was located immediately in front of the resort, where its beginning is visible on the beach. It proved to be a breakwater 396m in length and 28-34m wide. It ran more or less due S from the shore and curved slightly to the SW at its seaward end. It was made of heaped stones, 7m high in a place where a section was drawn, and had sloping sides and a flat top. The sheltered W side was made of stones of ca 0.30- 0.40m diam. but the E side, exposed to the prevailing NE winds, was of much larger blocks, 0,80 x 1.00 to 1.10-1.30m. Part of the top had slight remains of a paved surface preserved. As this paving must once have been at least a metre above sea level, and is now as much as 9m below, a considerable variation of the sea level here since antiquity is implied. It was not possible to excavate for dating material, but the earlier excavations on the Mekyberna mound only metres away dated the site to 432-316 BC. The considerable size of the mole supports the contention that the harbour of anc. Olynthos was indeed here. (AAA 21, 102-110). Nea Roda (5km SE of Ierissos, at N end of Xerxes' Canal). In 1992-93, J. Vokotopoulou and E.-B. Tsigarida continued the excavation begun in 1990, in the sanctuary area SW of the</page><page sequence="70">70 DAVID BLACKMAN village. In 1992 the ground plan of a small temple of the oikos type was completely cleared. It was 10.40 x 6.70m, with its longer walls on an E-W axis, and the entrance on the E. It stood on a diorite podium ca lm high, and its walls consisted of double rows of rectangular limestone blocks, with the narrow interior space between them packed with small stones and mud. The interior surface of the walls had been plastered, while the exterior face was decorated with a honeycomb pattern. Cor tiles in the destruction level round the building dated its construction to the LA period. Palmette antefixes, and eave tiles painted in a guilloche pattern in red, off-white and dark brown were found, as were many fragments of three terracotta, mould-made, painted akroteria representing Nikes, two of which were standing and one was in a kneeling/running pose. Pottery from within the oikos, and also outside, where there were offering pits and pyres, dated to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC, so that the sanctuary was apparently in use from LA to mid HL. In 1993 work concentrated on a large, probably public, building SE of the oikos, the ground plan of which is not yet complete. Outside its monumental E entrance were three bases and two fallen marble heads, both dated to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. One was that of a young girl, and the other was a male head with holes for the attachment of rays of a different material. The latter is identified as Helios. (AEMTH 6, 467-71; 7,445-50) Xerxes' Canal. Work continued in 1996 under the overall direction of Dr B.S.J. Isserlin (BSA), who reports: "Additional investigations were carried out with the purpose of determining the possible course of the canal where this was unclear, and its main fixtures. The work was carried out by two surveyors from the University of Leeds, and two geophysicists from the University of Patras. Work was concentrated on those areas regarded as likely to offer the best indications of the presence of the canal, both in the areas at the S and N ends of the canal's course where our earlier investigations had encountered difficulties, and in the central sector where evidence additional to that gathered before seemed desirable. Seventeen geophysical traverses were measured across the site during the visit, the surveying team establishing the ground surface profile of each while the geophysical team undertook a series of reflection, refraction, and resistivity measurements to determine sub-surface conditions. In addition, a 10m square grid was laid out over an area of 80 x 40m to enable magnetic measurements to be carried out. Although it is too early to draw any definite conclusions from the work, data collected during the visit do appear to indicate features of what could possibly be a canal at several of the geophysical traverses. However, these features have yet to be confirmed by laboratory study, and the full facts will not be known until the ground surface profiles are matched with the geophysical sub-surface information. Once this has been done, a detailed report will be prepared." Nea Syllata: Veria. Th. Pazaras and A. Tsanana of the 10th Byz Ephorate continued their rescue work in the building plots at the foot of Vrya Castle (Med). In the M. Paspales plot there were three main building phases: part of a bath complex, used, with some alterations, in the 2nd-4th/5th Cts AD; a massive building complex (use uncertain) also found in neighbouring plots, which was founded on top of it in the 5th-6th Cts AD; and finally, the rooms of this were subdivided in MByz, perhaps to be used as dwellings. These were destroyed and abandoned in the 10th Ct AD; a hoard of coins of Leo VI was found in the destruction level. Remains of MByz buildings were found in G. Lazarides' plot (stores? workshops? stables?). These were destroyed and abandoned in the late 12th/early 13th Cts BC, and after that the area was used for burials over a long period. This approximate destruction/desertion date is also found in other plots and it seems that during the 13th Ct AD the lower town was abandoned and the population retired to the castle. The possible reasons for this are discussed. (AEMTH 6, 511-21) Nikete. Under the auspices of the Cultural and Technological Foundation ETBA, a three-day conference on 'The Bee and its Products' was held in this honey-producing centre in September 1996. The section on antiquity included papers with such themes as honey on Linear B tablets, bees on coinage, the part played by bees and honey in Greek and Roman myths, honey in the anc. Mediterranean diet, and references to bee-keeping in Greek papyri. There were also sections on the mediaeval period, and on traditional practices. Short summaries of the papers are given (in Greek) in Archaiologia 61, December 1996, 107-8. Anc. Olynthos. Ph. Athanassiou describes a three-year programme of re-excavation, re-drawing and restoration of insula AVII of the Sth/4th-Cts BC city on the N hill. The restoration drew on D. Robinson's original records supple- mented by information from the new excavation. The object was both to preserve the site and to make it more intelligible to visitors. (AEMTH 6,503-6) Ouranopolis. E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou reports the find of a built cist in the agricultural area here, by the road leading to the border of Mt. Athos. Grave goods consisted of a lamp and a 3rd-Ct AD coin. (AEMTH 7, 421-4) Polychrono. On two adjoining plots belonging to P. Athanasiades, on the NW edge of the modem settlement near the EBA toumba, an ECh 5th? Ct AD building was discovered. It had an earlier, vaulted stone-built tomb only 0.10m below one of its floors. White plaster partly preserved on one of the tomb's interior walls had a cross incised on it. After the building was deserted, the area was again used as a cemetery. (ADelt 282-4) Poseidi. On this sandy spit on the W side of the Cassandra sub-peninsula, ca 4km W of anc. Mende, trial trenches in 1989 produced foundations of two buildings and some inscribed sherds. In 1990-93 the annual excavations of J. Vokotopoulou brought to light many more, clearly dedicated to Poseidon. The most striking of these is perhaps that on the rim of a LA Attic krater, in which the suppliant calls for the help of 'yataox6o KuavoxaliTa', echoing the epithets used by the Cyclops Polyphemos when invoking his father Poseidon against Odysseus: KX60t, nooei&amp;aov, yatxoE, Yao ua, voai'ra. The foundations of four major buildings were excavated. The latest building, temple A', possibly founded in the early 5th Ct BC, was oriented NW-SE. It had been carefully fitted between two earlier, Archaic buildings in such a way as not to prevent their continued use. Building B', to the SE, was a large, wide, rectangular structure. Building F', to the N, was directly beside temple A' and, like it, was oriented NW-SE. Both its ends were apsidal, with the SE apse probably being established in an earlier phase than the rest of the building. This apse had cut into the N apse of a yet earlier apsidal building, ST'. This was 14.27 x 5.4m, and on a N-S orientation with an open end at the S. It was probably founded in the 11th Ct BC. Within it was an area which had been used for burnt offerings over a long period. As well as bones, shells, burnt earth and ash, the lower levels of this open ash altar contained sherds from hand-made pottery of open shapes, local SMyc and the local equivalents of PG/G, while the uppermost 0.20m had 7th- and 6th-Ct BC</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 71 material. The later stage of this pyre was contained on its W and S sides by structure E', which had been built above the W wall of building ST'. In the C period the main area of sacrifice moved to two successive altars S of ST', the more northerly of which, according to an inscription on one of its stones, was dedicated to Poseidon Pontios by Chalkas son of Lysos. E and S of the early apsidal building ST' and the later area of sacrifice were set two rows of clay 'pipes'. These were usually constructed from a pair of curved roof-tiles, with the hollow space formed between them filled with pebbles. The pipes were set in pairs, which leaned diagonally towards each other. They were a 4th- Ct BC addition to the sanctuary, and intended for libation. (ADelt 284-8; AEMTH 6,443-7; 7,401-7) Potidaia. Three building plots were excavated in 1991-93. Plot No. 120 contained part of a stone-built R building. In disturbed fill just below the surface was the well preserved torso of a LA marble kouros. In Plot 228 seven tombs of the known LR cemetery of anc. Kassandreia were excavated, one of them a built ChT with many interesting construction details. (ADelt 281-2) Plot No. 129, the Pechlivanides Plot, was at the S end of the modem village. In 1992 K. Sismanidis and J. Karaiskou report that it contained a few 5th-Ct BC walls; a main building phase consisting of parts of two houses, each with at least four rooms, of the first half of the 4th Ct BC; and part of an ER building. The earlier pottery included Cor and Attic bf and rf sherds, and there was a fragment from a Panathenaic amphora with a chariot race and the inscription APIETOBOYAOI / EYBOYAIAOY / [AP]MATI ... Stamped amphora handles and terracotta figurines were numerous, and more than 380 coins were recovered. (AEMTH 6, 485-90) In 1993 D. Koussoulakou removed the baulks in the same plot and dug tests below the level of the main 4th-Ct building phase (which seems to have continued in use throughout the HL period). Though A building remains were few, they were clearly on a different orientation from that of the later houses. There was an extensive A stratum covering much of the plot, with many sherds, chiefly 6th-Ct BC. This is the first major evidence for the A period found in Potidaia. The 4th-Ct BC houses may be associated with the foundation of Kassandreia on the site of anc. Potidaia. The same archaeologist gives an account of other HL buildings located during the excavation of a ditch for a water supply pipe beside the country road leading S from the village. Under a destruction level of tiles connected with one of these was a well with a carefully cut stone structure intended as a foundation for the (missing) well-head. Three burials were also located in other parts of the ditch. All were without grave goods, but one stone sarcophagus with a gabled cover contained a well-preserved skeleton. (AEMTH 7, 455-60) Anc. Skione. In the NW part of the hill called Mykitas, the site of the anc. city, a previous trench which had C building remains was extended. Long sections of stone-built walls were uncovered and also ca 50 large rectangular stone blocks of various sizes, lying in disorder in an anc. trench cut in the bedrock. They may have come from some earlier important building, perhaps A. In another test a few metres W of this, the corer of a large C building in isodomic masonry was discovered. Its N wall was followed for 20m and the beginning of its E wall was found. It still stood to a height of about im, and had a well-preserved cobbled pavement built against its exterior. (ADelt 288-9) Anc. Stageira (ca 2km E of Olympiada). The anc. city was situated on a N-S promontory with two hills, with the higher S hill to the landward end. K. Sismanides first investigated the site in 1990, and conducted major campaigns in 1991-93. A Classical wall ran E-W up and over the S hill somewhat S of its summit, spanning the promontory from shore to shore. Before the excavation the wall was unknown, because of the thick scrub covering the steep slopes. By the end of 1993, most of its external face and much of its interior had been exposed. Its state of preservation is exceptional-in places it stands 4m high. Most of it was built in the masonry style consisting of large dressed rectangular blocks interspersed with stacks of small flat stones; shorter lengths of it were in the Lesbian style. Five towers were discovered: a large circular one at the wall's highest point, two smaller semi-circular ones on its W leg and two rectangular ones on its E leg. Staircases leading to battlements were found in four places. A carefully-engineered system of clay pipes ran under the W leg, bringing a water supply to the city. The walls themselves had built-in drainage vents. A triangular fortification ran N from the internal face of the wall to enclose the acropolis, its SE angle being based on the large circular tower. The internal faces of this triangular fortification had buttresses at regular intervals. Within it, near the large circular tower, were an underground plastered cistern and a large, deep, approximately rectangular fissure in the bedrock filled with burnt remains, which had not been completely excavated. Within the N angle of the triangle, the highest point on the promontory, was an approximately rectangular enclosure, probably a lookout post. The main fortifications continued right round the promon- tory. A length of the W wall, which had an entrance and a paved way outside it, was explored. At the N end of the N hill, a long stretch of later fortification was cleared. A coin of Philip II was found in its foundation trench. Its course carefully respected an A shrine, with which a contemporary stepped road was connected. This led towards a circular structure, (diam. ca 1 m), also A. From the shrine area came many figurine fragments and a complete mould depicting two opposed nude male figures, one older bearded and one young, and a ram. Several C and HL dwellings were investigated on both hills, but all were very poorly preserved owing to the steep slopes. The downhill wall in all cases was much thicker than the other walls and had no uphill face. It apparently had to serve as a retaining wall for fill, thus creating a platform on which the house could be built. On the saddle between the two hills a long C stoa was found, with A remains below it. This was probably the public area of the city. Excavations were to continue. (ADelt 289; AEMTH 6, 451-61; 7, 429-37) Stratoni (anc. Stratonike) (17km NW of Ierissos). E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou describes the excavation of a small R agora, found in a new building area at the S end of the town, on level ground inland from the promontory Elaiona, the main archaeological site of the area. The agora had a paved central court with a well in the middle, and small rooms-shops or workshops-round the sides. It covered an area of 29.8 x 23.00m. Three building phases were distinguished and it was in use from the 1st Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD. (AEMTH 7,416-421). Torone. Three articles concerning this site have recently appeared. In PAE 1993, 117-27, A. Cambitoglou gives an account of the geophysical and underwater surveys during the 1993 study season, already covered in AR 1993-94, 52. A more detailed article on the 1993 underwater survey by C. Samiou et al. has appeared in Mediterranean Archaeology 8, 89-100. In AE 132, 107-20, A. Henry discusses the topography of Torone in the light of the two references in Thucydides. Dr R. Jones reports on geophysical survey work in 1996: "Archaeological work at Torone, in a collaborative project</page><page sequence="72">72 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 86 of the Australian Institute and the AS, was restricted to the third and final season of a geophysical survey. Work was targeted at four locations (Fig. 86: a, P, y, and to the E of wall B e, ( and 11), in each case extending the area previously surveyed. Clear-cut and potentially important results were obtained on the isthmus leading to the lekythos (Fig. 86 a); following the survey in 1994 by G.N. Tsokas using ground- penetrating radar, resistivity soundings indicated clearly the presence of a large wall and possibly a similar but smaller and less deeply buried structure closer to promontory 1; both seemed to traverse the isthmus. Resistivity survey on promontory 2 (Fig. 86 P) suggested the presence of a wall at the SE corer and some building remains, mostly in poor condition, close to bedrock and situated in the vicinity of the previously excavated area (1982). Further survey was carried out on terrace 4 (Fig. 86 y) moving eastwards from the area of the already excavated C houses; a mosaic of building remains and a few probable R tombs were evident. To the E of wall B, survey in the so-called 'suburb' area (see Thuc. V.2) revealed an intriguing series of anomalies which are at present interpreted as platforms or terraces constructed roughly parallel to the prevailing slope. With the exception of a weak linear feature ending in a square or rectangular structure at the top of area h, the evidence for coherent building structures was limited in the 'suburb' area; either building may have not been widespread in this area or the lack of modem terracing on the steep slope (especially in area e) has meant that survival of (ancient) building has been poor." Nome of Pieria Dion. In AEMTH 6, 217-20, D. Pandermalis publishes the now famous water organ, and gives details of the operation and history of and the literary references to this type of musical instrument. It was found in the building insula opposite the Villa of Dionysos and E of the anc. main road, in the NW corer of a courtyard outside a large room. The destruction level here was sealed under a thick stratum of mud. It was remarkably rich in finds: iron tools, several small unfinished sculptures, storage amphoras, and vessels and other small objects of bronze. Amongst these was a very well-preserved bronze gynaecological instrument found directly under the mud in the 1993 season. Prof. Pandermalis illustrates and discusses this in AEMTH 7, 196-8. In 1992 S. Pingiatoglou continued the excavation of the Sanctuary of Demeter in the N part of the area E of the N-S line of small temples, and found two more altars. The first was the foundation and fragments of the upper part of a raised stone altar, in use in the late 3rd/early 2nd Cts BC. Evidence suggests that it could have been dedicated to Aphrodite and that that goddess was also worshipped in the sanctuary. The second was an eschara, a square, walled construction with a central opening giving onto a pit for offerings to underground deities; it dated to the 1st Ct AD. This brought the total of altars found in the sanctuary to six; all contained or were surrounded by numerous votive objects. In 1993 yet another square altar was found opposite the southernmost building. It had holes in four of its blocks, probably for libations. Not far from this was a small pottery kiln (AEMTH 6, 223-9; 7, 195). In 1992 A. Mentzos investigated the N and S annexes of the 5th-6th Cts AD Cemetery Basilica. The N annexe was at first used in connection with prothesis but was later converted into a baptistery. The E room of the S annexe was found empty but may have been a diakonikon; the W room contained a wine press. In 1993 a coin hoard was discovered in the N annexe (AEMTH 6, 235-42; 7, 196). In 1993 work also took place in many other areas of Dion. New towers were located on the N fortification wall and also on the N ECh wall-the latter had an altar/pedestal dedicated to Septimius Severus built into it. Tests to study stratigraphy in the odeion area produced part of a 5th-Ct BC vase in the lowest level. The HL agora may have been located near the monument with the shields. A mosaic and fresco fragments were found in the central basilica. Baths were located on the main road, opposite the shields monument. Excavations behind the shields monument uncovered part of the large basilica; below its walls were those of an earlier period. A new building, the Zosa House, had an unusual ground plan and the inscription EYTYXI ZQZA incorporated in one of its mosaics. (D. Pandermalis, AEMTH 7, 195-7) North Pieria always has a number of rescue excavations, usually EIA to ECh cemeteries in building plots and fields. In addition to these, in the summer of 1992, three major public utilities began construction here: the second branch of the Thessalonike-Katerine national highway, the new Athens- Thessalonike railway line and the natural gas pipeline. The area affected was that between Katerine and Nea Agathoupolis (anc. Methone). M. Bessios had the unenviable task of locating affected sites, organizing rescue excavations, and supervising a very large work-force both in 1992 and throughout 1993. Unless otherwise stated, the information given below is taken from his reports. Katerine. At the entrance to the town from the second branch of the national highway, a group of R tombs was excavated. There was one vaulted tomb, and the rest were pit and tile graves. (AEMTH 6, 245; 7, 201) Nea Agathoupolis (railway line). W of this settlement, in the area of anc. Methone, R tile graves were investigated in two areas. (AEMTH 7, 203, 205) Kitros: Louloudia (railway line). A settlement site with continuous LBA-LR occupation was located. An area 200 x 50m was tested on its summit. The shallow topsoil was disturbed, and the main result was storage pits of the 6th-5th Cts BC. (AEMTH 6, 245; 7, 203) Kitros: Alykes Chrysochoides plot (S cemetery of anc. Pydna). This excavation was scheduled to take place in 1992 before the triple emergency started. In 1984 a single- chambered Macedonian tomb, a rock-cut chamber tomb with two chambers and a number of cist and pit graves dated second half of 4th-mid 2nd Cts BC had been excavated here. The 1992 excavation brought the total number of tombs to 46. Some cremations were among them. Most tombs were unlooted. In</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 73 one female burial, a gold coin of Philip II had been placed in the mouth, and the name of the deceased, EENAPIZTH, had been incised on it. A neighbouring male burial had the same, the name being ANAPQN. The richest grave was that of a late 4th-Ct BC girl, with much gold jewellery: two pairs of earrings, two necklaces, two bracelets, two rings, and numerous terracotta figurines and vases. (AEMTH 6, 247-8) Korinos. In 1991, two tumuli which stand on either side of the national highway to Thessalonike were excavated. That to the E, the so-called Macedonian tomb of Pydna, was dug by Heuzey in the last century, but had filled with soil. One leaf of the marble double door and one sculptured slab of a kline were found. Their companion pieces were taken to the Louvre by Heuzey. Objects recovered during the re-excavation date the tomb to the end of the 4th Ct BC with continuing use till early in the 3rd Ct BC. The W tumulus covered a double-chambered Macedonian tomb with a simple fagade, which had been repeatedly robbed since antiquity. It was almost entirely filled with earth. There had been a double door in the entrance, fragments of which were found in the chamber. Decoration was preserved in both ante-chamber and chamber. Two stone structures in the chamber had been damaged by robbers. They had supported the wooden biers of the dead, one of whom had been cremated. Much remained in the tomb: pots, fragments of gilded wreaths, gilded clay and bronze beads, bronze palmettes from vessel handles, a pair of bronze greaves, etc. One of the biers had had exceptional decoration: ivory plaques with incised scenes, and naked human limbs from a carved composition. Among the heads two probably represent Persians, which suggested that the subject depicted could be the expedition of Alexander the Great-but it could also have been mythological. Like the other, this tomb was erected in the late 4th Ct BC and used until the early years of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 292-3) Korinos: Krania. The gas pipeline passed through a C-HL settlement. The limited excavation located EHL building remains. The Macedonian tombs mentioned above may have been connected with this settlement. (AEMTH 6,245; 7, 201-2) Korinos: Toumbes (national highway). An excavation 250 x 50m in extent took place between two large funerary mounds. A BA settlement and cemetery were found. The shallow earth overlying the stereo was ploughed and eroded, and no above-ground structure of the settlement remained, but the contents of about 40 storage pits which were investigated, dated it to the latest phase of the EBA, up to the LBA. Most of the sherds were from hand-made pots, but there were some Minyan and a few Myc sherds. Thirty-five tombs were excavated. A few were in the settlement area, but most were farther S. Contracted burials in pit graves predominated. Many graves had been robbed, but pots had been left. The majority were hand-made and local, but they were often accompanied by Myc vases. Some bronze daggers and stone, clay, bronze, silver and some gold beads were found. One tomb was EBA, but the rest were LBA. (AEMTH 7, 202-3, 205). Makrygialos. 1991 was the third year of excavation in Lot 947 (anc. Pydna N cemetery), and added another 65 tombs, bringing the total to 285. They dated to EIA, 5th, 4th and early 3rd Cts BC. Lot 945 was also in the N cemetery. Sixty-seven tombs were excavated: EIA, 5th-Ct BC and EHL. (This part of the cemetery was not used in the 4th Ct BC). The EIA cists usually had a floor of gravel or small pebbles, a well-known Myc practice. The survival of Myc customs in Pieria was further confirmed by two EIA chamber tombs. Amongst the 5th-Ct BC tombs, one had cremated bones in a copper cauldron, a white-ground lekythos, an iron strigil, and the remains of a lyre (tortoise-shell sounding board, iron strings and ivory plectrum). (ADelt 292) Makrigialos: Aerogephyra (railway line and national highway). In Agricultural Lots 279 and 280 an area of ca 10 str. was investigated. There were indications of settlement in the LBA, 5th Ct BC and the R period. Part of the W cemetery of anc. Pydna was also found. This had pit and cist graves (some with cremations), many of which had very rich grave goods. The tombs dated from the second quarter of the 4th to the mid 2nd Cts BC. The oldest tomb, T.10, a pit grave, contained a skeleton 1.96m in height, with which were found an iron sword and daggers, a bronze strigil, and metal fittings from the wooden coffin. In AEMTH 7, 207-12, D. Ignatiadou publishes the glass finds from three late 4th-Ct BC female burials found in Lot 279. These include a bead, two scaraboid sealstones, and both core-made and cast vessels. The tombs were ranged on either side of an anc. road, the continuation of which was encountered when the second national highway was cut through the same locality. Here there were R tombs (pit and tile graves, cremations in shallow pits and one single-chambered rock-cut ChT which contained the burials of a HL couple). There had also been one R and several Byz graves beside the road in the railway line cutting. (AEMTH 6, 245-7; 7, 203-05) Makrygialos: Agiasma (railway line and national highway). M. Bessios and M. Pappa report the discovery here of a N settlement, extending S of the present village and W of anc. Pydna. It is estimated to have been at least 500 str. in extent, of which ca 60 str. was destroyed when the first national highway was built in 1968-70, and another 60 str. (railway: 50 str.; highway: 10 str.) was to disappear in 1993-94. Before this took place, however, the whole of the targeted area was to be excavated, the largest systematic N excavation ever to be conducted in Greece. The settlement had two phases, both LN, Makrygialos I being pre-Dimini and Makrygialos II Classical Dimini. The two phases only overlapped a little in the area they occupied, and there may also have been a slight chronological gap between them. The earlier settlement was surrounded by two ditches. The enclosed area was not thickly settled. The dwellings were circular wattle and daub structures partly sunk into the ground. The later settlement, also apparently enclosed by ditches, and much more populous, used the same house type; one house had a cobbled surface immediately outside it, beside which was a small oven, proving that cooking was done outside. One area (still being excavated at the end of 1993) seemed to have many ovens grouped together. There were a number of subterranean storage pits; one retained an earth-cut staircase and the settings for storage vessels in its floor. Some pits, such as those filled only with shells, may have been for a special purpose. The only burial found within the settlement area consisted of the cremated bones of an infant in a small pot. As well as masses of pottery (including, to judge by illustrations, some of excellent quality) the site produced all the usual N categories of small objects and domestic debris in great quantities. There was considerable variety in jewellery of stone and shell, particularly of spondylus, which was being worked at the site. Almost 150 clay and marble idols were discovered, more numerous in Makrygialos I, but found in both phases. A large marble idol from Makrigialos II is the cover illustration on AEMTH 7. N of the Neolithic settlement ran two anc. roads flanked by some C but mainly R graves. In the NE part of the N settlement a small C-ECh settlement was noted. Considerable lengths of</page><page sequence="74">74 DAVID BLACKMAN the line of clay pipes which had supplied water to anc. Pydna were investigated in the new railway cutting. In the second national highway part of the excavation, the discovery of anc. vine slots contributed to knowledge of the agricultural life of anc. city. (AEMTH 7, 203-5, 215-20) Makrygialos: Dexameni (railway line). An EIA cist grave and a few R tile graves and cremations in shallow pits were excavated here. (AEMTH 7, 204-5) WESTERN MACEDONIA Agios Achilleios Island, Mikre Prespa. In 1992 N.K. Moutsopoulos investigated Byz fortifications on Kale hill here. An elliptical area (70 x 49m) was enclosed by a wall im wide, built of small unworked stones bonded with white plaster. A single solid rectangular tower projected from the SE of the circuit. On the summit were the poor remains of a small chapel of the same building material. The castle is identified as one of two built by the Emperor Basil II in AD 1017 during the final stages of his suppression of the rebellion after the death of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuel. It was called 'Constantion' after his brother and co-emperor Constantine. (AEMTH 6, 18-23, 26) Agrosykia: Ambelia locality (ca 10km NE of Giannitsa). A. Chrysostomou reports on an EIA cemetery, excavated in 1990- 91, which contained nine graves. Four were cists with walls of river pebbles, and in the other five the body was laid on a pebble floor with stones heaped over it. A sixth stone heap which covered layers of pottery and burnt earth, but lacked human remains or grave goods, may have been the site of funerary offerings. Male burials contained iron weapons and two- handled jars; female burials were distinguished by one-handled cups and bronze or gold jewellery. As well as known types like spiral bracelets and spectacle fibulae, the bronzes included unusual items, such as three tall hollow bronze cones each crowned with a pair of horns, five anchor-shaped ornaments and a belt consisting of 42 circular bronze plates with pierced attachments. M. Stylianides, who identified the site, handed in a varied collection of bronze jewellery found during cultivation of the area, as did a neighbouring land-owner, G. Lazarides, from his field at Leptokarya. (ADelt 297-300, 307-8) Aiane: Leivadia locality. In 1991, owing to restricted means and manpower, excavation at this important site was confined to a single trench near where quantities of matt-painted pottery were discovered in 1988. All the types of matt-painted pottery known from the Aiane cemetery were found, along with Myc wares in two types of clay. (ADelt 303-4) Anydro: Myloi locality (18km WNW of Giannitsa). IA bronze ornaments were handed in by K. Georgalas; they were probably from an extensive tumulus cemetery in the area. (ADelt 308) Archontiko (between anc. Pella and Giannitsa, ca 4km from each). After meticulous preparation, in 1992 the 17th (West Macedonia) Ephorate and the University of Thessalonike began a joint excavation programme on this large toumba and table, which had surface indications of occupation from N to Byz. The toumba. A. Papaefthymiou-Papanthimou and A. Pilali-Papasteriou, for the University, opened trials on the S slopes of the toumba in 1992. Deep deposits of N habitation, perhaps terraced, were found. EBA remains were present but limited. An apsidal building with well-preserved walls of unworked stones was found below topsoil. The mixed pottery within it was dated to the end of LBA-G. Stratigraphy of this part of the toumba was very disturbed, with N, EBA, IA and even C, R and Byz sherds in the same deposits. (AEMTH 5, 151-7) New trials in this area in 1993 uncovered parts of two circular structures, probably IA, and, further E, part of a house with post-holes, in which was a silo containing ca 15,000 grains of Einkorn wheat. These gave a C14 date of 2200-2112 BC. Also in 1993, trenches on the E slopes of the toumba came upon undisturbed EBA deposits. The walls of a building, rhomboid in plan, were found only 25cm below the surface, with part of another, on the same orientation, to its S, and walls of a later phase to its W. All these walls were stone-built. In a trench E of these were remains of another EBA house, destroyed by fire. On its well-preserved clay floor were four raised clay structures, probably hearths or ovens, and 12 intact pots as well as many broken ones, including storage vessels. Carbonized seeds were also found. Another building had a child burial in a pithoid amphora below its floor. Other finds included clay 'anchors' and a large number of shells (in antiquity Archontiko would have been only a short distance from the sea). (AEMTH 7, 147-52) Botanical remains. S. Valamoti gives a most interesting report on the wide variety of plant remains found in the silo in the house on the S slope, and deposits in the houses on the E slope. Einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) was clearly stored in the settlement, and as at Assiros, was left in the husk until needed, probably as a protection against fungus and insects. Other grains and pulses which were present amongst the Einkorn wheat in much smaller quantities included wheat (Triticum dicoccum), a single husk of spelt (Triticum spelta), barley (Hordeum vulgare), broad beans (Vicia faba), red vetchling or chickling peas (Lathyrus sativus/cicera) and lentils (Lens sp.). Their presence may have been accidental. A typical weed in the sample is Darnel rye-grass (Lolium temulentum), the Biblical tare. Its grains had to be separated from the wheat because of being subject to a fungus which could cause blindness. Acorns (Quercus sp.) in the house destroyed by fire may have been intended for human consump- tion, rather than for pigs, as their cups and most of their shells had been removed. Grape pips (Vitis vinifera) were found but present evidence is insufficient to prove cultivation. Figs (Ficus carica), blackberries (Rubus fruticosus agg.), Cornel cherries (Cornus mas) and elderberries (Sambucus sp.) added variety to the diet. (AEMTH 7, 155-8). The table. In 1992 A. Chrysostomou and P. Chrysostomou of the 17th Ephorate tested different areas here, all of which had HL building remains and Byz finds. Area IV, 20 x 20m, in the central part of the table, produced evidence of Byz intrusion, including a deep pit, but no building remains; and a LC/EHL phase with parts of buildings and a road. Below this was a thick stratum of yellow clay (probably dissolved building material) associated with the IA pottery. Part of a N-S wall was found, but there were no other building remains. This stratum produced a wealth of pottery, mostly wheel- made and of fine, well-fired clay with striking painted decoration, often applied over slip. Common shapes included amphoras, cut-away-necked jugs, oinochoai and small bowls with raised handles. One unusual vessel had a bull's head protome. Other finds were large conical loomweights, two large IA bronze beads, and a small faience pendant in the form of a hawk, possibly representing the Egyptian god Horus. The same deposit continued to bedrock, into which storage pits of the period had been cut. Sherds from an amphora with</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 75 LG type decoration, a probable import, were found directly above the bedrock, confirming that the earliest date in this part of the mound is the late phase of the Macedonian IA. (AEMTH 6, 163-72; 7, 159-65) Aridaia. A small antiquities collection derived from the Kranio and Apsalo localities was transferred from Aridaia to the archaeological collection at Edessa because of unsuitable storage conditions. The collection comprises five IA clay oinochoai and one R one, a variety of IA bronze ornaments, and a bronze coin. (ADelt 308-9) Dispelio (S end of Lake Kastoria) the N settlement. In 1993 the excavation here was extended to the lake shore. Two phases were distinguished, the earlier dated to the beginning of the LN period, and the later to its end. Buildings of the earlier phase were constructed on platforms supported on wooden piles, many of which, as well as other building remains, were well preserved. In the later phase, however, they were erected on man-made fill. The pottery shows similarities with that of areas as widely dispersed as Thessaly, Albania and Pelagonia, which may be because the site is on one of the easiest natural routes between Thessaly and the Adriatic. The excavation is under the general direction of Prof. G. Chourmouziades. (AEMTH7, 13-15) Fortifications. Local tradition suggests that the whole circuit once stood over 2m high, but from a variety of causes it has been virtually demolished during the present century. In a short season in 1993, Prof. N.K. Moutsopoulos located part of the gate, of which he publishes a reconstruction, a round tower and short stretches of walls in polygonal masonry. The shallow stratigraphy was completely disturbed, but on the basis of the type of gate and comparison with other fortifications, an early 4th-Ct BC date is very tentatively suggested. (AEMTH 7, 1-8) Drosia (15km W of Edessa). Much of a N site was destroyed during mechanical excavation in the industrial zone here in 1992. A rescue excavation by S. Kotsos established that the site had been about 14 str. in extent. Parts of two clay floors, post- holes, a mill-stone, many stone tools and three fragmentary figurines were found. Pottery of limited types suggested a late EN/early MN date. (AEMTH 6, 195-201) Edessa: upper city/acropolis. During the installation of a new drain along part of Megalou Alexandrou, a cist tomb lined with waterproof plaster was found close to the Church of Sts Peter and Paul. It was of interest as an early instance of burial being permitted within the acropolis of anc. Edessa and may have been connected with an ECh phase of the present church. On the corer of Makedonomachon/Arg. Kytanou, illegal founda- tion excavations located a probable part of the city's ECh fortification wall. (ADelt 298-300) Lower city N cemetery. So many tombs were being brought to light by deep ploughing in the orchards between the N end of the anc. lower city at Longos and the villages of Klesochori and Rizari that at the end of 1991 the 17th Ephorate began an ongoing programme of rescue excavations in the area (Boubaras', Kartsoles', Raikos' and Ketitzidis' fields). Despite the presence of displaced stone slabs, no tombs had survived in Boubaras' field. Kartsoles' field yielded 50 graves (rock-cut cists and tile graves) dating HL-ECh. They usually contained inhumations, but there were a few R cremations. A vaulted rock-cut chamber tomb was also discovered; its earliest burial may have been EHL, and its use continued until the 2nd Ct BC. It was rediscovered and re-used in the 3rd Ct AD, when the dead were laid out on top of large curved tiles. In Ketitzidis' field a single grave came to light during the installation of an irrigation system. It contained two female burials with pots and jewellery, and could be dated by a fine gold coin of Julianus, declared emperor in Pannonia in AD 284-5, but murdered in Verona by Carinus before he could reach Rome. The 130 tombs in Raikos' field showed continuous use from C to ECh, and there were also two IA pithos burials. There was another rock-cut vaulted chamber tomb with a stepped dromos; coins showed it to have been in continuous use in the HL, R and ECh periods. Most of the other tombs were rock-cut cists, often tile-covered. Eighty of these were without grave goods, 41 were LR-ECh, and nine were C/HL. The earliest tomb is dated to the beginning of the 4th Ct BC by a coin of Amyntas, and four others were of the same century. The richest tomb was a female burial with clay protomes and a kourotrophos, many clay vases and a small bronze skyphos, a bronze mirror, six bronze fibulae, a necklace of faience and electrum, a bronze ring with Pan depicted on the bezel, and an exceptional silver ring with a glass seal stone bearing an engraved profile of Apollo, laurel-crowned, similar to those on coins of the Chalkidician League. The 4th-Ct BC tombs, amongst the earliest that have been found near Edessa, are valuable because nothing is so far known of the classical city. The cemetery as a whole probably extended along an important anc. road, quite possibly the Via Egnatia. Reports by A. Chrysostomou in ADelt 300-01, AEMTH 6, 185-9; 7, 114-17 cover the excavation to the end of 1993, and the project was to continue. Emathia. N. Merouses and L. Stephane publish a survey of prehistoric settlements in the N and NW parts of the nome, the area N of Veroia, E of Naoussa and W of Nea Nikomedeia. Thirteen sites are listed, four not previously known. These are Ano Zervochori (LN, EBA), Toumba Angelochoriou (LBA), Toumba Palias Lykogiannes (LN) and Toumba Sarandovryses (EN, LN). The conclusions reached were that EN settlements were relatively numerous, that there was an increase in the number of sites in LN, that settlement was sparse in the EBA, but the LBA was well represented by three sites. (Makedonika 21,339-60) Giannitsa. In 1992-93 Pav. Chrysostomou continued excavat- ing deep soundings in the building plots of the Old Market area in the SE of the town, which is set on a PR mound, Giannitsa B. These confirmed the presence of EN and LN, and in addition the Boutaki plot produced the mound's first MN strata, which contained anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, bone and stone tools as well as different categories of MN pottery. The EN settlement is of particular importance, and is compared favourably with Nea Nikomedeia. The area also provided valuable evidence for LByz and Ott, such as potters' kilns, a variety of sherds including glazed LByz, and the tobacco pipes for which the Ott city was famous. (ADelt 297; AEMTH 7, 135-42) S. Valamoti publishes a study of archaeobotanical remains from two EN phases in the 1991 Gabrielides Plot. There is clear evidence that the inhabitants were preparing and using monococcum and dicoccum wheat. Also identified were durum wheat (Triticum aestivum/durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare var. hexastichum), lentils (Lens. sp.), terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus/atlantica), elder (Sambucus), grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), cornel cherry (Cornus mas. L.) and various weeds and grasses, a collection very similar to those from other N sites in Greece. (AEMTH 6, 177-83).</page><page sequence="76">76 DAVID BLACKMAN Giannitsa Macedonian tomb (N side of the main road from Pella to Giannitsa, 4.5km E of Giannitsa). Pavlos Chrysostomou describes the excavation of the tomb and tumulus in 1993. The tumulus had a diameter of ca 100m and its original height was ca 15m. The largest of all Macedonian tombs at present known (external dimensions 10.30 x 6.30 x 6.10m high) was found in its southern part, with the entrance facing S towards the road. It had a chamber and ante-chamber (internal dimensions: 4.56 x 5m and 3.75 x 5m respectively). Nothing remained of the facade except the lower part of a Doric half column at either corer. It could be deduced from fragments that the entrance to the chamber was once closed with double marble doors which would have been 2m wide. The tomb's walls and vaulted roof were fairly intact except where treasure-hunters had removed stones in the walls and floor. Both chambers had had a floor of limestone slabs overlaid with thick white plaster. All the tomb's internal surfaces had originally had architectural decorations in coloured plaster (red and blue-black on white), and the position of what remains on walls made it unlikely that the tomb had had stone couches. The tomb was probably first robbed in LHL/ER, but there were so many later, amateur incursions, that the great tumulus was honeycombed with shafts and tunnels. It contained no other tombs, and had been carefully constructed of alternating layers of limestone chips and/or loose earth and red-black clayey earth, which had been laid on as mud. The latter dried into hard, dense strata which helped waterproof the mound and preserve its shape. In two different layers of the mound, two pyres were found, with mud bricks, ash and carbon, burnt animal bones, iron nails, glass and bone plaques as from a wooden bed, remains of bronze crowns of myrtle leaves and other ornaments, and plain and bg vases of various kinds (fish-plates were prominent), dated late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. These were apparently the remains of funerary meals which took place during the construction of the great tumulus. From these and by analogy with other Macedonian tombs, the suggested construction date for the Giannitsa tomb is early 3rd Ct BC. (AEMTH 7,123-32) Kitrine Limne. After a three-year gap, excavation was resumed at the Megalo Nesi Galanes site, and confirmed its occupation from earliest LN to FN and LBA. A quantity of clean, unfired yellow clay with a small heap of stones beside it and a large, shallow circular pit (ca 2.30m diam.) filled with successive layers of ash, may represent a late LN workshop area. Survey results now suggest that the Kitrine Limne basin was first inhabited as early as EN, and a few LBA sherds were also recorded, but the chief occupation seems to have been LN-FN. M. Fotiadis and A. Chondrogianni-Metoki again warn that half of the 14 known PR toumbas may be lost forever to the encroaching lignite mines within the next decade. (AEMTH 7, 19-30) Kozani. G. Karametrou-Mentesidi reports on a rescue excava- tion at Arkadiou 12-14 near Agios Constantinos church. A mechanical excavator digging a drain hit a large family tomb/heroon of the 1st Ct AD, breaking a marble sarcophagus with garlands and bucrania. Walls and floor of the approxi- mately rectangular building (4 x 2.20m) were of flat bricks mortared with lime plaster, and the interior was plastered. Four niches with bases for sculptures were set in the longer walls and although the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, some very fine sculptured heads were found. The Kozani Council voted to preserve the tomb, convert the adjacent road to a footpath and generally enhance the surroundings. (ADelt 305-7) Kypsele (ca 15km NE of Vergina). Work continued in the N part of the mound. S of the HL remains discovered here in 1988, a new building was found, partly divided into two rooms, in one of which was a bronze coin of Amyntas III (389-369 BC), and a small silver representation of Silenus with a hole for suspension. Many coins of Pydna mark commercial relations between the two towns. (ADelt 303) Longas, Kastoria. This fortified hill-top position near Kastoria is identified by N.K. Moutsopoulos as one of three castles destroyed by the emperor Basil II in 1017 because of continued resistance in the area after the death of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuel. The MByz fortification was a thick drystone wall without towers enclosing an irregular area, a refuge rather than a settlement. The foundations of a church found within it were unusual in plan; it had an enclosed graveyard E of its apse with infant burials. The drystone fortification was founded on a LR circuit of stone and lime concrete; a tower found on its E side had been roofed with tiles. Stratigraphy preserved in two store- rooms built against the internal face of the LR wall showed that the fort had been twice destroyed by fire. The earlier destruction was ca 7th Ct AD, probably during the barbarian invasions of that period. The later may be attributed to Basil II, after which the fort remained deserted. (AEMTH 6, 1-11, 24-25) Anc. Mieza. In the area between Lefkadia, Kopanos and Naoussa, provisionally identified as anc. Mieza, V. Allamani and V. Misaelidou report the discovery of four important structures during rescue excavations. Stoa. In the Demetrios field S of Lefkadia, a stoa-like building was first investigated by J. Touratsoglou in 1969. It consists of two parallel walls of well-cut poros blocks, 7m apart, which still stand almost 2m high in places. A row of Doric half-columns ran along the interior of part of the S wall near a staircase which led to a probable outdoor area to the S. From further sections of its walls which have come to light in other fields to the SE, the present known length of the building exceeds 106m. It was probably founded early in the 4th Ct BC and a destruction level between the walls is dated to the last quarter of that century. Rectangular building. In the Kavalares field, less than 100m SW of the stoa, a large rectangular building (21 x 24m) is divided into three areas, one possibly open. Its purpose is at present unknown. Its earliest use was late 4th /early 3rd Ct BC. House with atrium. About 300m SW of this building, was the LHL/ER house referred to in AR 1995-96, 28 (Kamara: Valavani Field), which had a central peristyle court with a colonnade on 3 sides (N, W, S). In its W wing it had an atrium with an impluvium. Not only did the floors of this area consist of opus signinum mosaics, but there is evidence that the walls here were decorated in the Italian style with opus reticulatum. To the W of this house was a N/S road, and beyond it part of another house. Theatre. About 100m SW of the rectangular building, a the- atre was discovered in 1992, and excavated in 1993. Its 14 tiers of seats were cut into a natural rise in the bedrock, facing E. The lowest six tiers were overlaid with rectangular stone slabs, and fragments suggest that the seats of the proedria were of marble and set in the orchestra. The seating capacity is tentatively estimated as ca 1,500. The almost semi-circular cavea is divided into five sections by four gangways. The orchestra is 22m in diameter and the main stage (of which little remains) and the proscenium are 22m wide. The preserved N part of the proscenium had two Doric half-columns and a doorway which was later blocked. The theatre was probably constructed late in</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 77 the HL period and continued in use until at least the 4th Ct AD. The presence of the stoa, the theatre and the large rectangu- lar building within a limited area suggests that this could be the the public area of anc. Mieza. (AEMTH 6, 203-13; 7, 89- 94; Victoria Allamani, Ancient Mieza-Kopanos, Lefkadia, Naoussa (booklet), Thessalonike 1995) Nea Zoe: Terikleia Hill (ca 8km NE of Edessa). A. Chrysostomou reports on rescue excavations in this area in 1993, financed by the mayor and council of Skydra, after deep ploughing in 1992 indicated that the whole hill had been inhabited in the LBA. The area had been known since 1980, when cist tombs were hit by a mechanical excavator. Amongst finds then handed in by its operator was a local imitation of a LH IIIB-C alabastron. The 1993 tests showed that occupation had started as early as the end of the EBA, although the LBA was the site's most flourishing period. It was presumably deserted before it was used as a cemetery in the EIA. One of the tests located 12 IA tombs set into the BA fill. There was one pit grave and the rest were pots ringed round by unworked stones. As well as pithoi, the cooking vessels with attached stands, pyraunoi, were used for burials. Most tombs contained infants, four accompanied by a single biconical bronze bead, but most without grave goods. One large pithos had five pots and a good selection of bronze jewellery, the latter datable to the later IA. On the evidence of walls and coins, the hill was reinhabited in the HL period. (AEMTH 7, 111-4) Pella, agora: I. Akamatis reports on three seasons (1991-93) of the University of Thessalonike team's excavation. Though most of the agora's W portico had been destroyed by earlier cultivation, its NE part retained its destruction level. Macedonian amphoras, amphoriskoi and perfume flasks of various types, including some outsize fusiform unguentaria, suggest that this part of the market dealt in aromatic substances. An aroma of a different kind no doubt arose from six establishments in the W part of the S portico, which opened not into the portico, but on to a road to their S. Here 'oil' amphoras of Latin, Brindisian, Koan and Knidian types were found. Some contained quantities of razor-fish shells (solenidae), the flesh of which was a delicacy, while others held fish-bones. A number of soundings to the stereo suggest a foundation date for the market complex in the second half of the 4th Ct BC, and its abandonment (almost certainly because of earthquake) in the first decade of the 1st Ct BC. These dates are corroborated by the contents of wells and the destruction deposit wherever preserved. Well fills are of great interest for the variety of industrial waste they contain, and when pottery from them is mended and studied, should provide a much-needed sequence for Macedonia in this period, closely dated by an abundance of coins. As some of the wells in the potters' quarter in the E portico are filled with their wasters, a wide variety of pot types will be covered. At the SW corer of the agora, a building round a peristyle court has been identified as the public archives. Evidence consists of over 100 clay sealings, a mass of clean fine clay from which they were prepared, and fragments of many styluses, all apparently fallen from an upper floor. A few of the seals bore marks of the linen thread which tied the papyri, and one of the seal-stones which was used for some of the sealings was discovered. It shows the profile of a youth. In a small room in the NE of this building, many used lamps were recovered, suggesting that work may have continued at night. Religious objects were also found here, notably the fragments of a large figurine of the Mother of the Gods, with a young figure in a Phrygian cap (Attis?) on her right shoulder. Finally, on the floor was some melted lead, and a piece of tubular lead monoxide, a by-product of the cupellation process by which silver was extracted from argentiferous lead. Other such tubes were found nearby in earlier excavations. (AEMTH 6, 111-21; 7, 183-90) Ceramic workshop. The standard two-room premises in the potters' quarter in the E portico of the agora were only large enough for sales and storage, and manufacture had to take place elsewhere. M. Lilibaki-Akamati reports on such an area found a short distance N of the NW corer of the agora. The establishment had six kilns, one large and rectangular, four circular and one elliptical, with many construction details preserved. Also found were stored clay, areas for working the clay, two large rubbish pits full of kiln rake-out, sherds and wasters, etc., and a storage area in which there was a large pithos filled with a great variety of smaller vessels, including lamps. Figurines and their moulds, 'Megarian' bowls, the moulds for producing them, and stamps for impressing designs and scenes into those moulds, were all present. In the large square kiln were fragments of tiles, pithoi, amphoras, and also smaller pots such as skyphoi and kantharoi. Macedonian amphoras, 'Megarian' bowls and moulds, pyxides, oinochoai, askoi, small bowls, plates and loomweights were found in the smaller kilns. The workshop was probably established in the 2nd Ct BC and was destroyed like the rest of Pella in the first decade of the 1st Ct BC. It was founded above two circular buildings of the late 4th-early 3rd Cts BC. (AEMTH 7, 171-80) Palace. Excavating N of the Propylon in the passage between peristyle courts I and II, V. Misaelidou found a semi- circular wall, curved side to the E, occupying the W half of the area; two building phases were observed here, both dated within the latter half of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 296) Canal area: as previously noted in AR 1993-94, 57 from AEMTH 5 83-96, the discovery of an inscription enabled M. Akamati to identify a building complex in this area as the shrine of a healing deity, Darron. (ADelt 295-6) Pella Macedonian tomb B'. In October 1992, during con- struction of a by-pass on the S side of the main road 4km E of anc. Pella, a bulldozer lifted the W cap-stone of this previously unknown and unrobbed tomb. (It may once have had a low mound, levelled about 50 years ago during cultivation). The road gang replaced the stone and informed the Archaeological Service, which undertook its immediate excavation. P. Chrysostomou reports that the tomb had a steep narrow dromos descending in three irregular steps from W to E. There was a single chamber (exterior 5.25 x 5.25m; interior 4.065 x 4.065m with the same measurement from floor to vault) built of well-cut rectangular local limestone blocks. The entrance was sealed with a wall of even larger blocks. Both facade and interior were undecorated except for a carved cornice at lintel level on the exterior and at the base of the vault within the chamber. A marble sarcophagus stood against the E wall opposite the entrance. Within this was a wooden larnax, which contained the cremated bones of the deceased (a woman) wrapped in a purple and gold cloth, of which only the gold threads remained. Two rather simple gold diadems representing myrtle leaves had been placed on the cloth, while mixed with the bones were a gold stater of Philip II, a small gold decoration in the form of a shoe and another representing an olive leaf, and fragments of burnt bone objects. To the right of the sarcophagus, on the floor, were a bronze bowl, a pyxis decorated in West Slope style, two clay unguentaria, and a small, pierced bone tube. In the SE corer of the chamber</page><page sequence="78">78 DAVID BLACKMAN stood a Thasian amphora, and near the NW comer of the sarcophagus were two bg lamps and a fallen iron lamp-stand. W of these was a glass bowl. This and the clay vessels can be dated to the late 3rd/early 2nd Cts BC, to the reign of Philip V, and it is tentatively suggested that the modest style of the tomb and its contents may be due to the difficult social and economic conditions which prevailed in Macedonia after his defeat at Cynoscephalae in 197 BC. (AEMTH 6, 137-44) East cemetery. Road-widening works in 1992 located a group of tombs belonging to this cemetery on the N side of the main road. M. Lilibaki-Akamati reports that it contained 47 rock-cut cist graves, 15 tile graves and four rock-cut chamber tombs dating from mid 4th to end 2nd Cts BC. An unrobbed cist grave in which a small girl was buried, contained a piece of gold leaf with her name, HIrHIZKA (diminutive of rlyrjaoS) inscribed on it, a known custom in burials of the second half of the 4th Ct BC at Pella. The location and dates of cemeteries and other evidence are drawn upon in a discussion of the topographical evolution of anc. Pella. (AEMTH 6, 127-35) West cemetery (of HL Pella-later E cemetery of R Pella). A ditch excavated for cable-laying in the Tantses field located four stone foundations of funerary monuments and eight tombs: seven tile graves (inhumations and cremations) and one enchytrismos in a cooking pot closed by a plate. The few grave goods included coins, unguentaria, a bovine figurine, and lamps, one with a dolphin on the disc and a stamp of C. uvn(ius) Drac(o) on the base. S of the Pella-Giannitsa road, 13m N of the fence of the Chatzegeorgiou furniture factory, more telephone company excavation hit a pit tomb and a stone slab cist. The latter contained a 2nd-Ct AD female burial with three pots and a necklace of glass, stone and amber beads. (ADelt 297) LR city wall. A short length of the wall of the R settlement at Nea Pella was discovered during the excavation of another cable trench. It was S of the main road, in the vicinity of the 'baths of Alexander the Great'. It ran N-S and was 2.10m wide. (ADelt 297) Petres. (W shore of Lake Petro, 4km N of Amyntaio.) An eighth excavation season took place at this HL settlement in 1991. On the so-called South Plateau the reason for a gap in the otherwise closely-settled area and some puzzling stratigraphy proved to be an anc. stream bed. In the so-called Area of the Fountain, the object was to uncover the houses on either side of the main road; seven rooms, belonging to three or four houses, were excavated. Amongst many finds was a plethora of mould-made bowls with designs not previously encountered. (ADelt 305-7) Servia: Haliakmon barrage sites. Some of the sites inundated by the flooding of the Polyphytos dam in 1975 reappear for a few weeks each year in November/December, when water levels are low. A. Chondroyianni-Metoki and C. Ziota report that surveys in this limited period have located some 20 previously-unknown PR sites on the S side of the dam. Surface sherds indicate that EN sites are much sparser than those of MN and LN; and that numbers of sites increase significantly in the BA. The N sites were often occupied for very long periods and seemed to cluster around the area of the natural river crossing near Servia, while the BA sites, possibly of shorter duration, were distributed throughout the area. Rescue excava- tions were undertaken at two sites. At Kryovryse near Kranidia (ca 4km W of Servia) a series of pits in the natural soil proved to differ both in types of fill and in period: the sample four excavated were EN, MN, LBA and Byz. A re-examination of earlier-discovered IA cist tombs here showed that some of their side slabs were re-used primitive anthropomorphic steles. At Tourla near Goules (ca 8km SW of Servia) 41 burials were excavated in an LBA cemetery: 26 were in large pithoi and smaller pithos-type vessels; two were in shallow pits, in one of which the skeleton was covered by large sherds; and 13, mostly children, were in small stone cists, which had had stone covers, and usually had earthen floors, though there was one with a pebble floor. Though inhumation was the norm, there were two instances of cremation in shallow pits. Most burials were accompanied by a single cup or bowl with one or two high, vertical strap-handles, and sometimes stone and bronze jewellery and other bronze objects. At Varemenoi, also near Goules, a N pot containing a cremation burial was observed within the boundaries of a N settlement. (AEMTH 6, 35-40; 7, 33-40) Near Rymnio (12km SW of Servia) further rescue work on an IA (8th-7th Cts BC) cist grave cemetery brought the number of tombs to 13. Though disturbed, they still contained finds of some importance, including a gold ear-ring. Part of a tumulus covering LBA cist graves was also excavated in the vicinity. These burials were accompanied by pottery and bronze and other jewellery. The later graves are provisionally dated to LH IIIC. G. Karametrou-Mentesidi acknowledges the help of Rymnio inhabitants in handing in chance finds (mainly IA bronzes) and in locating other sites, such as two IA cist tombs on the road to the mines. One of these was undisturbed and contained two pots, four bronze spectacle fibulae, two bracelets and a glass paste bead. (ADelt 304-5) Setina (Kaleto) (ca 27km NE of Florina, 4km NE of Skopos). A strategic fortified hill-top is identified by N.K. Moutsopoulos as one of the three centres of continuing resistance after the death of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuel, which was destroyed by the emperor Basil II in 1017. Tests excavated in the acropolis area at the E end of the fortifications produced mainly LR pottery and coins; one deep test against the E wall came down to bg fragments and one ?SMyc sherd. Stratigraphy here showed two burnt levels. The upper, 60cm below the surface, may have been that of Basil II. Another test had evidence for a LR destruction with burnt building remains and carbonized grain. A cistern, probably ECh, was located in the centre of the acropolis. E of the acropolis, a single-nave church with white-plastered pise walls and a wooden roof had been founded at the beginning of the 10th Ct AD. It was built over the mosaic floor of an ECh church. A grave cut through the mosaic could be dated by 12 silver Venetian coins to the 13th Ct AD, showing that the church survived Basil II's destruction. An ECh-Med cemetery was located on a knoll E of the church. (AEMTH 6, 11-18, 25-26) Vergina. 1992 was the first year of excavations here without Manolis Andronikos, and many reports lament his loss. The construction of the protective building over the royal tombs made excavation conditions in that year extremely difficult. In 1993, S. Drougou reports on additional archaeological and conservation work connected with this. An exceptional bearded ivory head was one of the resultant finds. The University of Thessalonike promised continuing scientific and financial support for the excavations. Sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods. S. Drougou continued work in 1992-93. Coins and pottery confirmed two main periods, LC (4th Ct BC) and HL, with buildings on different</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 79 orientations. There were two HL phases, the 3rd and the first half of the 2nd Ct BC. Mould-made bowls did not appear till the second of these two HL phases. The shrine was finally destroyed by conflagration in the mid 2nd Ct BC. Pairs of rooms are a feature of the sanctuary, and certain figurines, such as one of Eros riding a swan, suggest that Aphrodite may also have been worshipped here. (AEMTH 6, 45-8; 7, 43-7) Shrine of Eukleia. Ch. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli summarizes the results of excavation here since 1982, and outlines remaining problems concerning the dating of the various architectural elements and stages in this building complex. A number of small tests in 1992-93 were directed towards this end. Though much remains unsolved, it seems clear that of several destruction deposits the most widespread should be dated to the second half of the 2nd Ct/beginning of the 1st Ct BC and another to the end of the 1st Ct BC. In 1993 a third pit was found to the S of and on the same N-S line as the previous ones with the inscribed base and the sculptures, and the remains of the huge serpent. The new pit contained architectural fragments. The top left part of a HL votive stele, possibly depicting Kybele with a smaller male figure on her right, was found within the sekos of the larger temple. This plus the serpent sculpture suggests that Eukleia was not the only deity worshipped in the sanctuary complex. A short section of a 3m wide winding road outlined by walls was found running E-W across the N boundary of the site. At its E end, where a reused block served as a threshold, it seemed to join a fragment of a wider thoroughfare at right angles to it and running S, towards the theatre and the palace. (AEMTH 6, 51-7; 7, 51-7) Hellenistic house. In 1992 E.-B. Tsigarida re-opened the excavation of a large HL house in the E part of the anc. city. It had two building phases, one LC/EHL and the second LHL. It was destroyed in the 2nd Ct BC, but was apparently used for a short time afterwards. After the 1993 season the same archaeologist and architect N. Haddad have published a description and reconstruction drawings. As well as the usual internal court- yard, the house had an outward-facing verandah on its N side, next to the entrance. This combination of internal courtyard and external verandah, though not usual in C/HL houses, has also been found at Petres, possibly at Aiane, and in the palace at Vergina, which suggests it may be of Macedonian origin. (AEMTH 6, 85-89; 7, 69-74) NW buildings. A. Kottaridou describes work on a large, probably public building complex in the NW of the anc. city, which had at least four building phases, and was in use from the second half of the 4th Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. (AEMTH 6, 67-72; 7, 77-80). The same archaeologist reports on another large building in the same general area, found in the Kostoglides Plot. Two of its rooms preserved remains of non-pictorial pebble mosaic floors. It seems to have been founded in the reign of Philip II, and extended at the end of the 4th Ct BC. It was destroyed in the first half of the 3rd Ct BC and not rebuilt. Earlier remains on the site were a pit containing EIA pottery and an A pit grave; and much later ones were two rectangular pits with Ott material, and many small pits in which fires had been lit, each of which contained a shallow, poorly-fired clay vessel, glazed cups, at least one jug, and hundreds of oyster shells. (AEMTH 7, 83-5) Acropolis. In 1992-3 P. Faklaris and his team defined a further 29m of the inner face of the fortification wall, and found part of a staircase which once led to the battlements. Within the walls evidence for almost every aspect of daily life was preserved. Numerous coins show that the citadel was occupied in the 4th-lst Cts BC; 2nd-Ct BC house foundations were discovered, with an intact pithos sunk in one of the floors. A coin hoard (54 bronze coins, 187-168 BC, Thessalonike, Pella and Amphipolis mints) was found in another room. Most finds are of the 2nd-1st Ct BC. There is proof of metal-working, pottery-making (mould-made bowls and figurines, the latter numerous), and a weaving establishment. Military presence is attested by a bronze helmet's cheek-piece, a bridle attachment, and various lance and arrow heads. As well as pottery and lamps, brooches, pins, a seal-stone, beads, rings, perfume flasks, casket handles and decorations, keys, razors, ordinary nails and boot hob-nails were also recovered. Two large pits are thought to have been silos, and food remains include sheep/goat bones, shells, olive pits, and not only grape pips but an actual bunch of grapes, preserved by carbonisation. (AEMTH 6, 59-62; 7, 61-4) At Pournari, on a hilltop ca 2.5km W of the anc. city, A. Kottaridou and T. Vakoules excavated building remains, probably of the HL to ER periods. (AEMTH 6, 81-3) Cemeteries. A. Kottaridou reports on a number of rescue excavations which found tombs. During the construction of the building over the Great Tumulus, nine more tombs (pit graves, brick-lined cists) and a pyre were discovered to its E, in the area of its S ramp. One of the pit graves contained a male wearing the remains of a gilded wreath. In his right hand were two bronze coins of Philip II. By his right side were an iron lance and knife. There was an amphora by his left shoulder, and five small pots at his feet. A child burial in a brick-lined cist was accompanied by two figurines (seated goddess and kourotrophos) and another coin of Philip II. Most of the datable tombs were of the latter half of the 4th Ct BC, but there was one of the 2nd Ct BC. A very large, deep pit was located NE of the N entrance ramp. It contained masses of mud brick from pyres, a stone heap, bones of a large animal, possibly a horse, and sherds of a 4th-Ct BC oinochoe. Unfortunately its E half was destroyed, like much of the cemetery, when a football ground was constructed in the 1960s. In the Ambrikides plot, ca 150m NE of the royal tombs, two burials were found. One was a late 5th-Ct BC pit grave containing a female burial with omega-shaped silver earrings and the other was a pyre of the mid 4th-Ct BC. In the Vasileiades Plot, ca 200m N of the Great Tumulus, two brick-lined cists contained the remains of a mid-4th-Ct woman and a 2nd-Ct BC man with appropriate grave goods. (AEMTH 6, 72-4) Veroia. Despite the difficulties inherent in rescue excavations, a number of building plots here have yielded significant results. In the Simeonides Plot on Patroklou, in the SW part of Veroia and outside the city walls, a substantial part of some R baths was found: the hypocaust, and the mouth of the prae- furnium, the caldarium above, and to the N of it with floors on the same level, fragments of several halls, one with a mosaic floor. Here the excavation's only coin showed that the estab- lishment was in use at the end of the 3rd Ct AD. Because of indications in and near the area, it is likely that the baths were part of a public establishment as opposed to a private villa. Many tombs were discovered. In the NE of the town in the Voulgaropoulou Plot, there were five rectangular rock-cut cist graves. One was HL, one completely disturbed, but the other three had pots with could be dated to the third quarter of the 6th Ct BC: a Cor amphoriskos, a Cor aryballos with warriors, and an Ionian kylix (the latter could be slightly earlier). It is generally held that Veroia was not occupied before the end of</page><page sequence="80">80 DAVID BLACKMAN the 5th Ct BC and the earliest material found in habitation levels so far supports this date. The tombs are not isolated, however, but in a known cemetery of the city, and may be an indication of its occupation a century earlier. Three other chance finds in the area support this hypothesis. (V. Allamani &amp; M. Apostolou, AEMTH 6, 93-104) V. Allamani also reports on other tombs in ADelt 301-3. During excavation of a ditch in Stadiou near its junction with Thessalonikes two LR cist tombs, part of a known cemetery, were discovered. One was robbed; the other was a 4th-Ct AD female burial with two glass vessels and jewellery. One of its cover slabs was a reused statue base preserving two 2nd-Ct AD honorary decrees. At Komninon 22 a rock-cut vaulted ChT was found during mechanical excavation. It had three chambers, a smaller central one with two others opening from its SW and SE sides. The two latter had couches cut into the rock on three sides, those of the SW chamber also having carved pillows. All the couches and also the floors of the passages had been used for burials, evidently on wooden biers. Skeletons were poorly preserved and the tomb's interior much disturbed by water pouring in, so that it was difficult to distinguish individual burials, but the tomb had received a minimum of 7-8 burials and grave goods exceeded 170. It was in use in the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. Foundation digging on the Ralles Plot on Akropoleos brought to light a plain R sarcophagus and a 4th-Ct AD cist tomb with glass vessels. After excavating the Nikou Plot at Edesses 25 in 1993, A. Petkos was able to combine his results with those of earlier- excavated neighbouring plots to rescue two important ECh buildings from oblivion. In the 4th Ct AD part of an earlier building was demolished to make way for a baptistery and its forecourt building. Most of the kolymbethra was preserved. It was octagonal with sides alternately convex and concave. Its decoration included a cross in the centre of its floor, and there were pipes for water supply and drainage. The photisterio surrounding it almost certainly had four conches (three preserved). Its plastered interior had had painted decoration in red, blue and green. The N and S conches had entrances on both sides. Outside each entrance was a space paved with square plaques of coloured marble set diagonally. Around these and the exterior of the photisterio ran a passage floored with coloured fragments of irregular shape set in cement. To the W of the photisterio was the forecourt building (13.75 x 12.70m). Towards its centre was a square construction which may have been the base for the bishop's throne; if so, it would imply that the forecourt also served as a place of catechism. The N part of the forecourt was paved with large plain rectangular tiles, while the S part preserved fragments of mosaics with various geometric patterns. Coins date this building complex to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct AD, and it was destroyed by fire no later than the 1st half of the 5th Ct AD. Shortly after this, the ruins were covered with a fill 1.30m deep to permit the construction of a large building with an apsidal E end, divided into two chambers. The smaller, E chamber with the apse retained only traces of its marble plaque floor, but the large W chamber preserved parts of four rec- tangular floor panels, two composed of various combinations of square marble plaques of different sizes, and two of hexagons and triangles. It is known from nearby excavations that this was the easternmost building of a wing of continuous rooms which were connected with the N side of a 5th-Ct AD basilica. Although no indications of the building's function were found, by analogy with others it may perhaps have been a bishop's quarters (episkopeio). When it too was ruined (at the earliest at the beginning of the 7th Ct AD), the area was used for a cemetery of cist tombs, largely built out of spolia including sculpture and inscriptions. (AEMTH 7, 97-105) A. Petkos also illustrates and discusses three R mosaics, two from Veroia and one from Leucadia, and their derivation from and adaptation of the HL tradition. (Makedonika 21, 262-74) Excavations in 1993 (AEMTH 7, 97) revealed two building complexes of the 4th and 5th Ct. One of these consisted of a notable baptistery complex (a quatrefoil structure articulated at the centre by an octagon). Remains of fine floor mosaics (geo- metric motifs) and opus sectile and tiled floors were uncovered. On a destruction layer of the first half of the 5th Ct a single- aisle, single-apse basilica was built in the 5th Ct and abandoned or destroyed in the 7th, when the ruins were used as a cemetery. EASTERN MACEDONIA Agio Pnevma. From the known area of an anc. settlement an R funerary stele was handed in to Serres museum. In a frame on the upper part of the stele was the inscription: ETOYE A.O.P. YnEPB[EPE]/TAIOY F KETPIZIZ MEE/TIKENOOY EYAAI/M2N XAIPE XAIPE KAI XY FIAPOAITA MANTA FYNH. Below this the decoration on the preserved part of the stele showed an incised wreath or necklace set between two amphoriskoi. The Macedonian date of 174 in the inscription is the equivalent of 32 BC. (ADelt 318-9) Amphipolis. G. Karadedos, Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki and F. Revithiadou have established a far-sighted programme for the future protection and development of Amphipolis. Not only areas which have or are likely to have antiquities are considered, but also the related environment, especially the Strymon and its banks, and areas which have a visual impact on the site. These are recorded on index cards with background information, bibliography where appropriate, maps and illustrations, and divided into three zones requiring different levels of protection. (AEMTH 6, 533-47) K. Lazaridi reports on the progress of conservation in the gymnasion, which is built of poros limestone which abrades easily. In 1996, with funding from the Ministry of Culture, the walls of the palaistra, the hall of the baths, the naiskos, the ephebeion and the large E staircase were restored, and several areas were roofed. (Ergon 1996, 82) E cemetery. Alterations to the road between Amphipolis and Drama in 1992 resulted in the excavation of part of one of the city's cemeteries to the E of the fortifications. M. Nikolaidou- Patera reports that 91 tombs dating from the 4th to the late 2nd Cts BC were found. The cemetery was crowded, and often later tombs were cut into others not very much earlier. The main tomb types were rectangular pits cut in the stereo and tile graves. The pits were sometimes plastered and in one case the plaster had been painted. A few had a deeper shaft with a ledge round the upper part. The dead could be in a wooden coffin, on a bier, or placed directly in the graves. There were a few clay larnakes, chiefly for children, some cremations, a poros cist grave, and a 2nd-Ct BC chamber tomb with three steps, an ante-chamber and a chamber all cut in the stereo. Children's graves were richly endowed with miniature pots and figurines. Both men and women often had gilded bronze and clay wreaths and various vases. Male burials frequently had strigils, and female burials jewellery, often a mirror,</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 81 sometimes gold ornaments sewn on their clothes and in one case, a gown with gold embroidery. The majority had a coin to pay Charon in their mouths. (AEMTH 6, 549-55) The same archaeologist reports on the excavation of part of the NW cemetery of Amphipolis, necessitated by irrigation installation. Forty tombs were investigated, dating from the end of the 5th to the mid 3rd Cts BC. The majority of burials were inhumations in tile graves, larnakes, amphoras or pithoi (enchytrismoi) and cist graves. There were also cremations. The corpse was usually cremated in situ in a pit, but there were a few inurnments. The majority of tombs had been robbed, and most of the tile graves, larnakes and enchytrismoi were broken, but cist graves survived better, and some had rich finds. Most had a coin for Charon. The corpse in one pit cremation had been burnt in all her jewellery: a gilded bronze wreath, a gold diadem with dancers in various poses, gold ear-rings with cupids, gold necklaces and a gown decorated with tiny discs with rosettes and faces. She had a gold ring on her left hand, by her right some bone beads, and another bone object and a silver coin of Philip II in her mouth. In the neighbouring cremation pit, the corpse had a bronze mirror and an exceptional gold ring, engraved with Artemis before an incense burner, with her torch in her left hand and her sacred deer standing by her right side. Near this tomb was a cylindrical poros container with a lid. In it, used as an ash urn, was a large Kertch hydria with an Amazonomachy on the principal face, which still preserved vivid applied colours, blue, red and white, and added gold decoration. (AEMTH 7,477-82) Kastrolakka. In A. Primoudes' field deep ploughing unearthed a large cist tomb ca 2m below the surface. It was built of six stone slabs, with its three cover slabs still in situ, and was unrobbed. It contained a richly-endowed female burial with a bg squat lekythos, a bronze mirror, a silver coin, two gold necklaces and two gold rings, a plaque of gold, a silver needle, etc. It was dated to the end of the 4th/beginning of the 3rd Cts BC, and was in a known cemetery on the W bank of the Strymon which probably belonged to Amphipolis. (ADelt 318) The uncovering and recording of the fortification walls of the Byz city have been completed (Ergon 1996, 69-72). Square towers, and two main gates were located. Walls are constructed of worked poros blocks for the exterior, mostly taken from the ruins of nearby anc. Amphipolis. Many architectural spolia derive from the same source. Interesting finds from the excavation include a stele with a inscription asking for God's protection for the city, and an exceptional small ivory plaque (no dimensions) depicting Christ healing the blind man. Work will resume in identifying the monumental buildings within the wall, placing them into the context of the wider settlement now that the walls are fully established. A 1 th-12th Ct Byz church (cross-in-square) was excavated near Amphipolis in the Strymon Delta. Although badly damaged, fragments of mid- to late-12th Ct wall paintings were uncovered in the fill and in situ. The church is discussed in AEMTH 7,485. Anc. Argilos (6.5km S of Amphipolis). A collaboration between the Ephorate of Classical Antiquities at Kavalla and the Canadian Archaeological Institute, represented respectively by Z. Bonias and J.Y. Perreault, began excavation of this early colony of Andros in 1992. The site is an approximately triangular hill near the coast with an extent of ca 120 str. In the 1992-93 seasons, two areas were excavated. In the S sector, at the SE end of the site, part of an anc. road was already visible. This proved to be the road to the anc. harbour, now submerged, but visible in calm weather. The road, 5m wide, with a well-preserved paving of large pebbles and boulders, was followed for 15m. Another road, 2.50-2.00m in width, paved with schist slabs, met it at right angles. Adjacent to both these roads were buildings with remarkably preserved walls, entirely stone-built of uncoursed masonry, many standing to a height of 2.75m or higher. They date to the last quarter of the 6th-5th Cts BC with three possible periods of renovation/ alteration within the 5th Ct BC. Remains of an earlier building phase, with Cor and Attic sherds of the third quarter of the 6th Ct BC, were found in one trench. Its floor showed many signs of metal-working. In the 4th Ct BC a small new construction in one area partly reused some of the older walls, but no building in the S sector seemed to be later than 350 BC. In the N sector, on the highest point of the acropolis, A walls were found around and below an early HL building, which partly incorporated some of them. Two pits excavated in this quarter contained LA pottery, while four sherds from disturbed levels here (East Gr and PCor) dated to the last quarter of the 7th Ct BC. In the 6th Ct BC, Cor pottery was prominent and E Greek and Attic also present. Attic pottery and local imitations thereof started to predominate in the late 6th Ct BC, and Thasian sherds were also found. Attic pottery continued the dominant imported ware in the 5th and 4th Cts BC, with Thracian and Macedonian pottery also represented. Metal finds of iron, bronze and lead, included arrow-heads, rings, pins, keys, fish-hooks, etc. Figurines were of the local clay. Terracotta architectural members included the front of a cover tile with a Gorgon, and a very fine ram's head, still retaining traces of black paint on its horns. Local bronze coins were an unexpected find, supporting the view that, contrary to received opinion, Argilos may have struck its own coinage. The introduction to this article contains much interesting historical, geographical and background information about the site (AEMTH 7,465-73) An article by J.Y. Perreault in the Canadian Academic Institute in Athens Bulletin for autumn 1996, 4-5, refers to the 1994-95 seasons. The S sector had been extended to the NE and SW, and buildings preserved to almost their original height continued to be discovered. In the N sector, it is suggested that the single large HL building could have belonged to a farm or similar after the abandonment of the city in the second half of the 4th Ct BC. The C establishment on which it was founded was proving extensive. In 1994, a third sector was opened in a rescue situation during the widening of the modern road just below the site. This consisted of a single sounding in which virgin soil was reached 6.50m below the surface. The sounding produced a homogeneous stratum in which all the imported pottery dated to the last quarter of the 7th Ct BC, combined with local Thracian pottery. The Greek pottery (strangely, in a colony founded by Andros) was all from Asia Minor-at least in this sounding. There is no doubt, however, that the site is anc. Argilos. Part of a large A plate found in the N sector carried an inscription, engraved before firing, proclaiming that it was made in Argilos. Dikili Tash. In Ergon 1996, 72-4, Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki reports on the Greek section of the work on this AS site in that year. The investigation of House 3, one of four LN houses, was completed. The building, dated to ca 4,300 BC, was of unworked branches and mud, with estimated dimensions of 9 x 5m. No internal walls were found. In the middle of the N side was an oven which retained the lower part of its domed cover. The house was destroyed by fire and the walls and roof had</page><page sequence="82">82 DAVID BLACKMAN collapsed into its interior. One piece of roofing material recovered was 25cm thick, and composed of 14 successive layers of clay, which was probably laid on as a waterproof coating over a sub-structure of beams and branches. Remains of many pots were found above the floor, in the wall debris, and it is suggested that these either stood on shelves or were hung from the roof beams. Also found within the house were the bones of a large animal, a stone pounder/grinder amd an amulet. EBA pits filled with ash, charcoal, and quantities of burnt fruit and seeds were later cut into the ruins of the LN house. A report by the same archaeologist in PAE 1993, 137-44 gives a more detailed account of the 1993 season covered in AR 1993-94, 59. S. Valamoti and M. Mangafa give a preliminary report on the archaeobotanical remains of the 1993 season. Einkorn wheat, hulled barley, lentils, a type of vetch, chickling peas, grapes, acors and figs were recognized. Of these the wheat, barley, vetch and chickling peas were definitely being processed, and had not arrived in the settlement accidentally. The grapes, though probably wild, were clearly being used to make wine, one of the earliest known occurrences. The stalks and skins which remained after pressing were found. The results of the 1989 season showed that wild pears, cornel cherries and mulberries were also collected, indicating that different ecological zones round the settlement were being exploited. (PAE 1993, 145-7) The work of the French School at the site, reported in more detail in PAE 1993, 147-50, has already been covered in AR 1993-94, 59. Drama: Arkadikos. In the excavation of this very large PR mound which extends from within Drama to the borders of Arkadikos, two building phases have now been recognized. The later one consists of two walls which join at right angles, indicating two rooms so far in a house that exceeded 9m in length and 4m in width. The walls were of pise, with larger post-holes on either side and smaller ones within the walls. Architectural comparison is made with the 'Long House' and the 'Burnt House' of Sitagroi. The initial impression of the pottery of this phase suggests that it is end of LN-early EBA, provisionally equated with Sitagroi III and IV. Two walls joining each other at right angles have been distinguished amongst the masses of post-holes in an earlier N phase. This building is on a different orientation from the later one. In an area clear of post-holes in its W part were found a floor and a construction with associated ash, apparently directly concerned with food preparation; there were many small finds in this area. The site is being excavated as a collaboration between Thessalonike University (Prof. G. Chourmouziades) and the 18th Ephorate (K. Peristeri), and the team excavating and publishing the site includes A. Vargas, K. Touloumes, I. Anagnostou, S. Valamoti and R. Christidou (ADelt 319-22; AEMTH 6, 577-83) Kale Vryse: Mikre Toumba (20km W of Drama). From 1991, annual excavations funded by the Nome of Drama and the village authorities were uncovering an isolated, large (34 x 16.40m) rectangular building executed in well-cut and fitted semi-coursed masonry. Its upper walls had been of mud-brick, apparently with wooden ties, and it had been roofed with tiles supported on large beams, the burnt remains of which were found in the thick destruction level which ended its life early in the 3rd Ct BC. It was oriented NW-SE, the NE being taken as formal N. The building was entered by an off-centre monumental double passage opening from and at right angles to the long N side. This took the visitor through to a single space which occupied the whole length of the building's S half. There were two small rectangular rooms to the W of the entrance passage and three in a row on its E. Turning left from the entrance passage and left again into the central room of these three, one enters a forecourt or hall through which both the other rooms had to be entered. The room to the W of this forehall had a centrally-placed stone eschara or altar enclosing an offering pit (1 x lm) and vessels of a ritual type of the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. The other room contained many terracotta figurines. It was clearly a place of worship. Though there is no proof as yet as to the presiding diety, circumstantial evidence both anc. and moder suggests it may have been Dionysus. (ADelt 320-24; AEMTH 7, 51-3-6) Kavala. During alterations to the basement of a shop at Omonias 58, part of a sculptured marble slab was found, probably from a R sarcophagus. It depicts a male figure, preserved from the waist upwards, wearing a himation. R sherds were also found. (ADelt 310) Maara Cave (21km WNW of Drama). This cave, possibly 10km in length, on the S slopes of Mt Falakro, is known as perhaps the most important natural feature in the nome of Drama. From it flow the headwaters of the Angites river. No signs of human habitation were known from it, but a passage cut in 1980 to allow access to the cave destroyed part of a palaeontological deposit some 10m below the present surface. In 1992, K. Trantalidou and A. Darlas, of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology, excavated a test in the side of the passage, where the stratigraphy could be followed, and found not only palaeontological remains but stone tools, typologicaly dated to MPal. This is the first MPal site to be excavated in Macedonia, and one of very few in mainland Greece. The uppermost levels here had slight LR-Byz remains. In a second test within the cave, on the left bank of the Angites river, LN/EBA sherds and installations were found, the former being compared with Parademe IV and Sitagroi III. The work took place as part of a programme of recording the caves of Macedonia, and three others are referred to in the article, which has all the relevant bibliography. (AEMTH 6, 587-600) Ophrynio: Tsardakia locality. In K. Karandagles' field, deep ploughing showed up three burnt areas full of sherds from large unpainted vessels (amphoras, cooking pots etc) and roof tiles which may have been the remains of a HL pottery. Tests in the area did not locate any building remains. (ADelt 317) Orphani. Kanoni Hill. In the Kryonas field on the N slopes of this hill, where anc. Phagres is situated, a group of cist tombs of unworked poros slabs was found in 1991. They were probably LR and had been robbed. (ADelt 317) In 1993, after a gap of two years, M. Nikolaidou-Patera continued the excavation of the anc. city. The exterior wall of a large building and three of its interior rooms were found, but so ploughed away that often only the foundation trenches remained. The HL habitation level has likewise been lost to the plough, so that the uppermost remains are now C and A. Interesting finds from these periods were recovered from storage and other pits, notably complete amphoras and a bronze lamp with four nozzles in the form of youths' heads. (AEMTH 7, 499-504)</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 83 Orphani. Remains of a LByz or early postByz cistern were found here, and may be associated with an agricultural dwelling belonging to a nearby metochion of the Dionysiou monastery on Mt. Athos. (ADelt 352). Philippoi: G. Gounaris and G. Velenis continued the University of Thessalonike's training excavation in the area E of the Forum and the Octagon. The excavation of the 4th insula E of the Forum was completed and two ECh phases were studied. In the 4th Ct AD the whole insula was occupied by a single dwelling of 1,400 m2. Double series of rooms were ranged round the N and E sides of a peristyle court, and a single series on its S side. The building, much of which was two- storeyed, had a portico giving onto the so-called 'Via Egnatia' to the N. In the triangular S area of the insula bounded by the diagonal road were a triangular court, stables, a kitchen, baths, a well and a toilet to which there was access from the side street. In the mid 5th Ct AD the house was divided into two. A second peristyle court had to be created for the N dwelling, which also absorbed the portico. In 1993 work continued in insula 5. S of the previously-located independent two-roomed shops was a house of modest size, with a small impluvium; its ground-floor rooms were store-rooms and work-shops. A notable find here was a 5th-Ct AD Ionic column capital. E of the shops and the house was a passage leading from the 'Via Egnatia' to the diagonal road, and E of the passage was part of another small house at the limits of the area available for excavation. The roads round both insulae were investigated in both seasons. Parts of the surface of the diagonal road, its S kerb and columns fallen from buildings on its S side were discovered. A test on its S side showed that a well-paved street made a T-junction with it, demonstrating a change in the orientation of the city street grid in this area. There were buildings on either side of this new street. Coins from the excavations had a date range of 1st Ct BC-lOth Ct AD (AEMTH 6, 529-31; 7, 531-6). Theatre. In view of the need for consolidation and partial replacement of the E part of the analemma of the theatre here, in 1993 G. Karadedos and Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki conducted a small excavation to study the original structure of the wall and the reasons behind the problem. The theatre is not ideally situated and the E part is founded on a rubble fill, not bedrock. The analemma supporting the fill belongs to the original HL phase. It had an average thickness of 3m, and consisted of two walls, the outer one in isodomic and the inner one in polygonal masonry. The space between had a rubble fill, but the two walls were tied by long ashlar blocks, the ends of which appeared in both wall faces. The rubble held back by the analemma was carefully constructed with gaps between the stones to reduce the weight and allow for drainage, but despite this problems had arisen by the R period. During radical alterations to the theatre in the 2nd Ct AD, two half-arches were built across the trapezoidal space between the E end of the analemma and the city wall, thus using the latter to buttress the former. Vaulted roofs were also built over both parodoi, which had particularly thick walls on their S sides to help receive the transferred load. These measures might have worked could they have been kept in repair, but the theatre was abandoned from the 4th to the early 20th Cts AD. After the stabilization of the fill by a method involving concrete injections and metal bars, it will be possible to restore a number of fallen blocks to the analemma and to the larger arch, which will also be stabilized. The bars and concrete will not be visible. (AEMTH 7, 519-28) Promachonas-Topolnika. This PR settlement overlooking the Strymon valley straddles the Greek-Bulgarian border, and is the object of the first joint Greek-Bulgarian excavation. The site covers about 42 str. of which ca 2 are in Bulgaria. Bulgarian archaeologists began excavating here in 1980, but it was impossible to get an overall knowledge of the site's organization with so much of it in Greece. Greek participation began in 1992 with a topographical and surface survey. In 1993, four trenches were opened and reached the upper two of the three phases found in the Bulgarian part of the excavation. The uppermost phase had been completely destroyed by ploughing on both sides of the border. In the dug earth was found an unusual clay head with life-like features, estimated to be from an idol ca 50cm high. The Bulgarian excavations had produced a similar, slightly smaller head and some body parts about 10m away. At 0.40-0.50m below the surface, the second phase was encountered, and one trench exhibited a line of five post-holes, possibly representing a wall. The finds included sherds, bone and stone tools and other objects of daily use, and idol fragments. The pottery, dated approximately to the end of the 6th/ beginning of the 5th millennium BC, has wide-ranging geo- graphical origins. Akropotamou sherds typical of E Macedonia were found together with Gradeshnitsa pottery representing NW Bulgaria. For the first time on a site in Greece, sherds with Bitum decoration (produced by birch bark) were found; this type of decoration is known in Central Europe. A sherd with incised decoration known as Notenkopfverzierung, typical of the Linearbandkeramik of Central Europe, was found in the deepest fill reached. The Greek archaeologists concerned in the project are Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, I. Aslanis and F. Konstantopoulou, and the Bulgarian team consists of H. Todorova, J. Bojadziev, I. Vajsav and V. Draganov. There is to be a joint publication of the site. (AEMTH 6, 561-73; 7, 505-10) Thasos: anc. city. Museum extension. Some final details were completed in 1991 on an excavation on the site of the museum's new exten- sion, which began in 1989. Parts of three houses were found, two of them divided by a N-S road. Their clearest phase was R, but they were largely founded on earlier C and HL remains. Only in the LR period were some walls built either over the top of R remains or independently, such as two which closed the road. Two interesting finds were a marble plaque inscribed ABFAE/ABFAE/AB in letters datable to the R period, and the upper half of a statue of a bearded male deity in the destruction level in the courtyard of the R house to the E of the road. (ADelt 310-12) The construction of a terrace wall in the Triantafyllos Plot led to the discovery of an anc. terrace wall. The plot is in the steeply- sloping area to the N of the Temple of Poseidon, where the nature of the land has always required terracing. As no building was to follow, no rescue excavation took place. (ADelt 312) The Papakyriakou plot is situated in the SW part of the anc. city, within and a short distance from the S fortification wall. Four tests along its S edge produced spasmodic remains: LR tombs; an ECh wall and scraps of a mosaic probably belonging to it; an R wall, and well below it scraps of A walls and A pottery; and a short length of a very well built C wall. Five tests along the W part of the plot gave the more coherent result of part of a peristyle court with a well in a house originally HL but rebuilt and reused in the R period. (ADelt 313) In 1992 the whole plot and areas to the W and S of it were</page><page sequence="84">84 DAVID BLACKMAN excavated. Most of the plan of the house with the peristyle court was uncovered. It was about 440m2 in extent and approximately square. It had streets on its SE and SW sides with covered stone channels running down their centres. The drains of the house ran into these. These two streets formed a cross-road, and parts of two other houses on the same orientation as the first, also bounded by them, suggest that the town was laid out on the Hippodamian plan. (P. Malama and Th. Salonidis, AEMTH 6, 605-11; plan in AEMTH 7, 598) Excavation was completed in the Vlachopoulou plot, situated between the Herakleion and the anc. agora. Remains of at least two R houses of the Imperial period were recognized, which had been repaired at least twice. It was impossible to excavate earlier phases because of the high water table in this area. (ADelt 313-5) The 'arch of Caracalla' site was reinvestigated by J.-Y. Marc of the French School. Sufficient architectural members of the arch had been found for Marc and architect T. Kozelj to make a reconstruction drawing of the triple-arched monument, and Marc made the very interesting discovery that the inscription honouring Caracalla was a later addition to an already extant gateway which served as an entrance to the square which extended W of the Herakleion. Part of the original epistyle above the central arch had been chiselled away to make a wide enough space for the later inscription. No direct evidence for the original construction date of the monument could be found in the recent excavation (the fourth on the site), and the architectural style cannot be closely dated, though some similar features are known in the eastern provinces from the mid-2nd to the beginning of the 3rd Cts AD. The SE end of the Arch abutted against an earlier terrace wall, perhaps a NW part of the Herakleion precinct, and sufficient fallen blocks from it were found in the excavation to allow two courses to be restored. (AEMTH 7, 585-90) In 1993 Th. Salonidis excavated the Tsoupra Plot, ca 25m NE of the 'arch of Caracalla', and by combining the results from this plot with those of the previously-excavated Galanis and Trikoupis plots, and possibly with the earlier wall in the 'arch of Caracalla' plot, established the existence of a large HL building with a frontage of 50-70m on the road that linked the Herakleion with the anc. agora. The building once had a propy- lon, and a paved courtyard or passage led from it to a staircase up to the building's entrance. Within it, eight rooms or areas have been found so far. The building seems to have been founded in ca the mid 4th Ct BC, and was used, with alterations and additions, including a R atrium, until the end of the 1st Ct BC. It was unoccupied for about three centuries, then reused until the end of Anastasius I's reign in AD 518. Fragments of walls associated with a stratum of A pottery were found well below the HL building. (AEMTH 7, 573-81). P. Malama describes part of a R house excavated in the Giovanios plot on the W side of the acropolis, SW of the odeion, a known Roman district of anc. Thasos. Part of the marble-paved peristyle court with marble column bases (for wooden columns?) and a portion of the E wing were found. This building probably dates to the 2nd Ct AD. In the 2nd half of the 3rd or early 4th Cts AD the stylobate was used as a foun- dation for a wall of unworked stones bonded with mud, into which the column bases were incorporated. The nature of this second phase is uncertain. EHL walls were found at a greater depth. (AEMTH 7, 593-7) R. Etienne reports on the work of the French School in Thasos in 1992. Investigation of the anc. harbour continued in collaboration with A. Simosi of the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology. The mole at Ebraiokastro was explored. In the W part of the military harbour, fortifications of the end of the 6th Ct BC were recognized and in the E part quays and installations of the first half of the 5th Ct BC, which were perhaps the ship- sheds of the military fleet (for the 1988-89 harbour investiga- tions, see AAA 20, 75-92; and for 1991, ADelt 525 ff). The city walls were investigated in two places: next to the theatre, where a gate leading to its upper part may have been found, and in the acropolis area, round the Temple of Athena and in the hollow between it and the Sanctuary of Pythian Apollo. Both anc. and Med fortifications here included blocks in secondary use apparently taken from the krepidoma of the Temple of Athena. Work in the lower city consisted of various tests necessary for the final publication of earlier-excavated areas NE of the agora. (AEMTH 6, 617-20) On the rampart, Yves Grandjean and Francois Salviat report: "In 1996 we continued the study of the line of the rampart in the area of the acropolis, between the theatre and the sanctuary of Apollo. It proved possible to define the precise course of the fortification wall on both sides of the chapel of Prophetes Elias. Traces left by the wall were found on the gneiss rock and in places some foundation blocks of marble or gneiss, which had not been destroyed in the Med period, when material from the rampart was taken for the construction of the fortress and adjoining village. The existence of the road which, throughout this sector, runs along on the inside of the city wall, was con- firmed. This road is particularly visible along the section from the chapel of Prophetes Elias to the edge of the sanctuary of Apollo. Ca 100m N of the chapel, a square tower was brought to light whose walls were built of very large blocks of gneiss, and whose interior was filled from the beginning with earth and large fragments of gneiss. This tower was built at the same time as the rampart, at the beginning of the 5th Ct BC." On the SE approaches to the theatre, Didier Viviers reports: "The campaigns of excavation above the theatre, between 1992 and 1994, had revealed a complex of structures connected with the defence of the anc. city. It rapidly became clear that understanding the topography of this quarter was essential for the interpretation of the access points to the theatre itself (vide BCH 119 [1995] 667-74). But it was right also to define as far as possible the organization of the defence system in this area and, above all, the connection between the rampart brought to light since 1992 and a massive structure built perpendicularly to the axis of the curtain wall, which was only very partially unearthed in test trenches VII and VIII of 1994 (vide BCH 119 [1995] 668 fig.12 and 672). In 1996 we therefore extended test trench III of the previous years by more than 9m up hill to uncover the massive structure perpendicular to the rampart; three other test trenches (IX-XI), much smaller in area and depth, allowed us to record the rectilinear line of the curtain wall above and to link it up with the short section studied by Y. Grandjean and Fr. Salviat to the S, in the direction of the acropolis (vide BCH 120 [1996] forthcoming). Necropolis: the excavation of the preceding years had already revealed the existence of a necropolis in this sector. Trial trench XI enabled us to demonstrate clearly that this necropolis was placed here after the destruction of the rampart, since one of the burials partially covers the curtain wall. Only one destruction level of the terraces covers the whole of the sector. Nine new tombs were discovered, bringing the total known to fifteen. Seven of them were excavated this year,</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 hardly yielding more grave goods than those opened up in 1993-94. Rampart: we then attempted to unearth the massive structure at right angles to the curtain wall of the rampart. It was established clearly that this predated the construction of the rampart and returned towards the S. Its width (ca 2.80m) and the solidity of its foundations made us think at once of a defensive structure of which the N, W and S faces have been preserved while the E face has been destroyed, doubtless for the construction of the C rampart. Indeed, some blocks, of gneiss, of this first massive structure, whose construction is rectangular pseudo-isodomic, were re-used in the inner face of the C rampart. This massive structure rested against the bedrock above; at this point, a terrace wall comes to an end against its SW corer. The pottery discovered in the fill between this first massive structure and the C rampart dates from the 1 st quarter of the 5th Ct BC. As for the pottery found W of the massive structure, in rich, black earth which clearly establishes the identity of the layer as a rubbish tip, it seems slightly earlier. The examination of reused architectural elements in the ECh tombs enabled us to restore the elevation of the NW corner for nearly a metre." The S approaches to the agora. Markus Kohl and Jean- Yves Marc report on the 1996 excavations between the S boundary of the agora and the buildings of the R quarter, the paved street, the Court of the 100 Flagstones and the odeion: "The first part of the campaign consisted in clearing the brambles which had overrun the area and the spoil heaps from the excavations of the agora. The finds made during the clearing up operation were not negligible: more than 50 coins (the majority LR and one Byz), the hind-quarters of an A sphinx and a very fine terracotta torso of a muscular male figure of an unusual size for the material. Two areas of excavation were opened: at the SE edge of the agora behind the SE shops; and to the N of the rooms which border the Court of the 100 Flagstones. The purpose was the better definition of the architectural complexes partially excavated up to now: the monumental SE entrance of the civic centre and its link with the great, paved thoroughfare and the connection between the great square court which stretches to the S of the public square and the Court of the 100 Flagstones. The area at the entrance to the agora. Under a thick layer of topsoil, we brought to light the ends of the walls which bordered the great square court which stretched behind the SW stoa and the Bent Stoa. These formed an angle ca 15m from the Court of the 100 Flagstones. Their state of preservation is good: they are preserved in elevation and their revetment of marble plaques was found in situ. The excavation of these structures was interrupted, to wait for a conservator who could strengthen the revetment plaques before and during their unearthing. We were also able to show that this group of buildings (R agora? Macellum?) rested against a fine wall of pseudo-isodomic style, of the same construction and on the same orientation as the wall behind the SE shops: it is very probably the same wall, which implies that the SE shops stretched as far as the Court of the 100 Flagstones. As a result, we can now distinguish the following behind the SE corer of the agora: a large square court with rooms on three sides; the SE shops which line the paved street; the Court of the 100 Flagstones. The paved street. Careful cleaning of the paved street and of the buildings lining it, and a survey of these buildings has revealed the traces of a colonnade in front of the faqade of the SE shops: it is certain then that a colonnade lined the street on this side at least along part of its course. This observation enables us to explain the presence of numerous fragments of column shaft in this area ... as well as the shape of the monumental arch which ends this great thoroughfare." Cemeteries. Tombs were located on the edge of the forest road leading to the acropolis, the continuation of a previously excavated group. Two cist tombs with schist slab sides, a tile grave and two pit graves were investigated. One of the cists contained two squat lekythoi, and the other a bronze strigil. One of the pit graves had seven clay dolls or parts thereof, and fragments of a glass vessel. The tombs date to LC/EHL. At Nysteri, ca 3km W of Thasos, a large cist tomb of marble slabs, with a marble cover slab was found robbed. It had contained two burials. On the surface 7.50m from the tomb were broken marble architectural members, one of which preserved the inscription HPQI AHMODQN[TI]. Limited excavation located remains which were probably a funerary building, perhaps the Heroon of Demophon. Associated sherds and the inscription's letter types were HL. (ADelt 315). Thasos Island: Dzines. (S Thasos, between Limenaria and Maries). Prehistoric ochre mines were located in this mountainous area in 1981, during the programme of archaeometallurgical investigations which were a joint project between the Max Planck Institute of Heidelberg, the Xanthi branch of IGME, and the 18th Ephorate. The Ephorate began excavations in 1982, assisted and advised by specialist in mining archaeology G. Weisgerber of the Bochum Bergbaumuseum, and with the scientific and geological support of IGME Xanthi, represented by G. Gialoglou. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki and G. Weisgerber report on the completion of the excavation of two mines, T1 and T2. In T1 pebbles were used as 'hammers' and deer horns as wedges; there were also other bone and horn tools and flint blades. The ochre was apparently collected with small spatulas and kept in hollowed-out horn tubes. The deer-horn wedges were not found in T2, where only stone percussion tools seem to have been used. The T1 mine was dated to Upper Pal by radiocarbon tests which gave a result of ca 20,230 BP. This was supported by palaeozoological studies: in particular, one of the wedges was the horn of a Saiga Tatarica antelope, which did not survive in S Europe after the end of the Holocene period. Other surface and trial investigations on the hillside gave evidence of extensive mining activity. (AEMTH 7, 541-53) Limenaria. D. Malamidou and S. Papadopoulos, excavating the Sideropoulos plot in the middle of this seaside town, found the SW extremity of a N settlement bounded to the W by a stream bed which joins the sea a little further S, but otherwise of unknown extent. It was apparently settled at the end of MN, and is compared with Sitagroi I, Paradimi I and Karanovo III. Notable building remains were two very long retaining walls holding up banks of red clay, evidently to provide level building surfaces. House walls were of unfired mud brick or clay, and there were numerous post-holes. One group of these described a semi-circle, suggesting an apsidal building 3m wide but of unknown length. Clay floors had an admixture of small pebbles and were frequently repaired. Only the lower parts of hearths and ovens remained. These had a foundation of pebbles and sherds bonded with clay, with a coat of clean clay on top, which was hardened by the fire. There were also groups of stones laid flat, 85</page><page sequence="86">86 DAVID BLACKMAN surrounded by earth showing heavy signs of burning and containing food remains. One such had many fish-bones on and around the stones. Other stone structures, perhaps benches or work areas, were often found near hearths or storage pits. The latter, located within the houses, were very numerous, usually cylindrical, flat-bottomed, and plastered with a waterproof clay and lime substance. When they went out of use they were filled with food remains and discarded pots, some of the latter almost complete. There were also larger, irregular pits, apparently intended for rubbish, but these were outside and confined to the S (seaward) edge of the settled area. They contained domestic debris, ash and food remains. Amongst the latter, fish-bones, shells, and sheep/goat bones were notable, and although archaeobotanical remains were still to be studied, the presence of various cereals, pulses, wild fruits, etc. was noted. A full complement of stone and bone tools, stone blades, etc. was present, and there were a few biconical spindle-whorls, sherd discs and unfired loomweights. Jewellery consisted mainly of pierced shells and Spondylus bracelets. Stone beads and pendants were not so common, but one depicting an animal head is striking. Only three fragmentary clay idols were recovered. A surprising find was a contracted child burial in one of the earliest storage pits, which had then been filled in with large pebbles. With the possible exception of a quarz flake, there were no grave goods. It is emphasized that the area excavated was on an outer edge of the settlement, and that later phases of N occupation are likely to be found nearer its (unknown) centre. Surface finds of EBA sherds also suggest occupation in that period at Limenaria. (AEMTH 7, 559-67) Skala Soteros. A retaining wall of the historical period, the wall of an ECh building and a some stairs of the same period were further excavated. The roofing of the remains of the EBA settlement was completed, and various other work was done to give access to the site. (ADelt 315, 317) Survey work continued for the Franco-Greek map of Byz Thasos, this time in the SE of the island (Astridas-Thymonias areas). The pattern in the rest of the island is repeated here: small churches, with much use of spolia and coarse pottery sherds. Most interesting are the sites Agia Paraskeue and Agios Basileios where the remains of two more ECh basilicas may be located. The remains here may be those referred to by M. G. Perrot as being in these locations in his 1864 Memoire on Thasos. A third basilica was identified at Agios Nikolaos, Thymonias. Byz settlements were identified at Poamia and at the Kastro site, which appears to have been inhabited from ECh times through to the 8th Ct and then from the 15th-19th Ct. Evidence was also uncovered in the Theologos area of the monastic-ascetic tradition which the Byz sources mention as having thrived on the island. This consisted of modest signs of inhabitation in sites centred on small churches with graves. (ADelt 349-50, 358-9) Excavation began on the basilica at the Agia Eirene site at Limenas, known from earlier investigations. The three-aisled basilica may have been built in the 5th Ct and was destroyed by fire, then abandoned. Pottery indicates that the site had been occupied from the ER period. A mosaic floor was located in the nave. Work continues. (ADelt 352-3) Thasian territory. Michele Brunet and Gilles Sintes report on their 1996 fieldwork, carried out in collaboration with the 28th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Kavala (Z.Bonias): "A campaign of verification on the ground was carried out in parallel with the editing of the monograph on Le territoire insulaire thasien. We proceeded to visit systematically all the sites (about 150) referred to in our catalogue for the N and W parts of the island, our chief purpose being to locate them precisely by means of a GPS (latitude, longitude and altitude); at the same time we finished our collection of samples of material from the surface (sherds and millstone fragments). This work has also allowed us to test the appropriateness of our method of prospecting and the validity of our analysis of the strategies for valorisation of ancient space: several new agricultural areas and two amphora workshops previously unknown (situated high up in the district of Sotiros) were thus discovered, which fills in perfectly the network of sites in the NW half of Thasos. In the Museum, the whole of the material gathered in the course of the survey was inventoried, classified and stored. A similar campaign will be carried out in 1997 to complete the work of verification and location of sites in the E and S parts of the island and to start, in collaboration with A. Muller, the study of millstone fragments found in rural and mining sites." THRACE So many new sites have been located by chance here, that they can only briefly be listed. Nome of Xanthe: Abato: 12th-Ct AD coin hoard. Chalepi: EIA sherds on a nearby height. Erasmo: Chert flakes and Byz sherds and tiles. Krios: Oval enclosure with some lime mortar; pithos sherds and roof tiles. Magiko: PR, C, HL and R sherds, many other movable finds and a destroyed building or buildings. Pezoula: rock-cut wine-press and signs of quarrying. Stavrochori: oval enclosure with a cross-wall. Nome of Evros: Alike: EIA sherds and various ruined stone enclosures. Avantas: on Bos-tepe hill 8km NW of the village, a huge, largely ruined, dry-stone enclosure. R sherds were once found near it during mechanical digging. Dadia: on Paliokastro hill an undated drystone enclosure. Elaphochori: ECh and Byz settlement remains. Goniko: destroyed 'dolmen' cists. Rock carvings in the Tsogkara locality depicting two winged creatures, some hollows and a disk. Kavissos: on Dorgiane or Makrylophos hill an EIA settlement and possible burials; also extensive (LR?) fortifications with towers. EIA and wider R settlement material at the foot of the hill. Leukime: EIA sherds on the Gkamela heights. Marasia: on Phylakes hill an EIA settlement; at Choraphia Marasion, thick hand-made sherds with applied decorated bands and plain wheel-made pottery. Megalo Dereio: three destroyed EIA 'dolmen' cist tombs; a ruined enclosure and a circular structure on a nearby height. Peramo: a ruined peribolos within which building foundations and materials were visible. Typical finds were the small amphoras associated with peak sanctuaries of the Thracian Horseman. Petrota: on Palaikastro, EIA sherds and a post-Byz enclosure; at Aspalo, cist graves (Byz?) in the woods; on Karakopetra, EIA sherds and signs of quarrying. Phylakto: at Zesto Nero, remains of a LR building, probably baths. Provatonas: rock-cut conch and lime plaster wall with fallen tiles and a 12th-Ct AD glass bracelet; local tradition speaks of a chapel of Agia Marina. Souphli: R settlement and tile graves. Vrysiko: on Phylake (formerly Zintan) heights, EIA pottery, a</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 ruined lime plaster fortification wall, and cuttings in the rock, including stairs, channels, flat areas with rims, and a pithos- shaped cistern. (ADelt 338-42) Abdera: rescue excavations. Between deep ploughing, antiquities thieves and illegal building, rescue excavations at Abdera took place all year round in 1991. In K. Georgiades' field at Asprolophos the plough hit the cover of a well-made poros sarcophagus. The skeleton was much decayed and the only find was an alabastron. In the Makre field on the Lophos ton Tsakalion (Tsakal Tepe), antiquities thieves had attacked two more poros sarcophagi with gabled covers. They had been covered by a mound which had been ploughed away. One had been airtight, and parts of a recently-broken small wooden object, perhaps a pyxis, were found in the disturbed earth within it. All that remained in the other were fragments of the lower part of an alabastron. In the field of Th. Papargyre, a rescue excavation took place in the wake of an attempt by antiquities thieves. Two tombs were found. A cist tomb with its cover missing, and its walls, built of re-used pieces from earlier cist tombs, partly ploughed away, was completely empty. A 3rd-Ct BC tile grave contained a child burial with an unguentarium and a seated male figurine. In the Bardakes field at Lagotopos, deep ploughing revealed a painted sarcophagus of the Clazomenian type on the N edge of a small tumulus. It had been previously robbed and contained only a few bones. The clay was in very poor condition and covered with accretion, so that little could be seen of its decoration except a lion and a bull below a band of astragaloi at its head. The whole field was full of clay sarcophagus fragments. In the Katsikas field at Paliochora antiquities thieves broke and robbed another of the poros sarcophagi typical of Abdera; only a few bones remained. Heavy rain showed up a burial pithos under one of Paliochora's dirt roads; when excavated, it proved to have been previously robbed. Another previously-robbed burial pithos was found during ploughing in the Vamvakides field at Armyra. In the Eleutheriades plot in the place known as Bogiatzes Pegadi in the Molos vicinity, the owner struck a poros sar- cophagus while digging. The subsequent rescue excavation located five other burials in clay larakes within a small tumulus. The sarcophagus and one larax had been ploughed away to floor level. The other four larnakes were intact, two covered with tiles and two with gabled clay covers made in two parts which joined in the middle. The skeletons had not survived and there were no grave goods. A possible offering between two graves was a 4th-Ct BC askos; outside another was the clay figurine of a dog (burials of a child and two infants were indicated by grave sizes). Sherds in the tumulus' fill were 4th-Ct BC. In the Laspidos plot, also at Molos, illegal excavation of house foundations largely destroyed four funerary offering sites, a built tomb, two tile graves and two funerary pithoi. The contents of one of the latter survived. The poor remains of the skeleton rested on Scms of gravel. Finds included a bronze mirror, a gold ornament and a 4th-Ct bronze coin of Orthagoreia. In the Tsebes plot at Aspre Ammos, Molos, an excavation following an application for a building permit located two successive small Byz churches, the later of which had an associated cemetery. The excavation was transferred to the 12th Byz Ephorate. (ADelt 325-9) Walls of the S peribolos. D. Kallintzi, who was responsible for the rescue work outlined above, also conducted six tests on the N and NE parts of the S peribolos of the fortifications in 1992-93. This was to define the archaeological zone in view of a summer settlement developing in the vicinity. One test located a probable tower. The other five each produced a section of the wall's outer face (usually only the foundation course) which was covered by a stone heap which had been the wall's central fill. In no case was an interior face found, and it may not have been necessary at the wall's lowest level, if the ground within the fortifications was higher than that without. The wall was invariably founded on bedrock or stereo, and there was no indication of any previous use of this part of the site. Pottery amongst tile fall to the interior of the wall in each test was C/HL and supported the theory that the S peribolos was built in the second half of the 4th Ct BC. The town is thought to have been moved to the new site then, because the original settlement in the N peribolos had become untenable as its harbour had silted up. Road work near but outside the NW corer of the S peribolos, in a marshy area, started displacing large rectangular stone blocks. In the rescue excavation which followed, under fill 4m deep, a well-built wall-like construction 2.4m wide was followed for a length of 36m. Many factors suggest that this was part of the city's W sea wall or quay, and geomorphological investigation has shown that in antiquity the sea formed a gulf in this vicinity. (AEMTH 7, 627-34) AS excavations. In PAE 1992, 160-66 and 1993, 135-6, Ch. Chrysanthaki-Koukouli reports on her work in those years on the A wall of the N peribolos and its associated buildings, the succeeding shipshed, the later bronze workshop and later still the HL cemetery. This has already been covered in AR 1992-93, 63 and 1993-94, 64-5 from Ergon reports. Anc. houses in the N peribolos. 1992 saw the conclusion of E. Skarlatidou's excavations in the Abramoglou land at the place known as Balta Zambaki within the N peribolos of the fortifications. The earliest stratum, which was without building remains, contained late 7th/early 6th Ct BC material. Above this was a building phase of the mid 6th/early 5th Ct BC. The next, main building phase consisted of two houses on either side of a road. House Beta (late 5th/early 4th Ct BC) had an entrance from the road which led directly into an L-shaped corridor-stoa giving onto a small courtyard. A plain table amphora was found in situ set upright below the floor level of part of the courtyard that had no paving. Its mouth was closed by two small bg cups or bowls. Slight traces of rooms opening off both parts of the stoa were found. House Gamma (2nd half of the 5th Ct BC) on the other side of the road had a paved open area around a well, and traces of rooms, one of which had had a mosaic floor. A later house, Alpha (late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC) was founded on top of house Gamma. This later house had one very large room, a bathroom and its auxiliary area. It probably had an upper storey. It was covered by a destruction level. Its N wall was later incorporated into a large, rough, poorly-constructed enclosure, probably connected with agriculture or animal husbandry of the R period, by which time the anc. city was confined to the S peribolos. The results of this excavation suggest that the area of the N peribolos of Abdera was continuously inhabited from the 7th to the 3rd Cts BC. (AEMTH 6, 685-91) Abdera (Polystylon). Excavations during the 1984-86 period uncovered a large Byz church of the 9th-10th Ct, with an hexagonal baptistery to the NE from an earlier building phase. The size, location, and antiquity together with the presence of 87</page><page sequence="88">88 DAVID BLACKMAN the baptistery indicate that this may have been the cathedral of Polystylon, and ancillary structures may be identified with the episcopal palace. Excavations to the W of the church found evidence for an open portico. After its collapse, the area was used for burials. Finds (all from children's burials) included two earrings, a ring, two twisted wire bracelets, a twisted wire necklace, and a small bone bead. (ADelt 354-5) Dikaia: One of a group of four tumuli ca 4km NW of the village, original diam. 30 x height 4.50m, was gradually reduced to ground level by mechanical excavation. At this level 18 pyres from funerary ceremonies were found, disposed around three cremation burials. The ceremonial pyres contained quantities of sherds, chiefly from amphoras and plates, animal bones, fragments of glass, and iron and bronze objects. The latest of the three cremations was carefully covered with tiles. Four pots had been set against its N side. Within the grave were a pair of gold earrings, a gold ring with an impression of the sole of a foot, a gold necklace, glass beads, remains of glass vessels, fragments of a bronze brooch, iron and bronze studs, a quantity of carbonized walnuts, and a bronze coin of the Adrianoupolis mint of the time of Commodus (AD 177-192). The other two cremations took place in pits cut in the natural soil. The first had a line of eight pots set outside its N side, and within it were a pair of bone dice, sherds of glass and clay vessels and lamps, bronze shoe attachments and iron shoe soles, many other scraps of bronze and iron objects, carbonized fruit and two bronze coins of the same type as above. In the other pit cremation were an unbroken krateriskos, remains of three other pots and part of a lamp, two glass vessels and scraps of iron objects. The dead may have been inhabitants of the neighbouring Adrianoupolis. (ADelt 336) Kalyva (24km NW of Xanthe; 12km NW of Stavroupolis). In 1991 D. Triantaphyllos continued his excavation of this fortress, one of several controlling the passage through the Nestos valley from the S foothills of the Rodope Mountains above its E bank. Probably first established by Philip II, the fortress was in continual use from the 4th Ct BC to the 6th Ct AD. The chief phases were in the 4th and 2nd Cts BC and the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD. There was also clear evidence of an earlier EIA settlement. The fortifications enclose a long, rather narrow oval space, oriented approximately N-S. It has four circular towers, and two rectangular ones, the latter at the S end near a double gateway. Three of the circular towers, one rectangular one, the double gateway, much of the curtain and a large beehive cistern were part of the original foundation. A circular tower at the N and a rectangular tower and related walls at the S end were 2nd-Ct AD additions. Amongst the discoveries of the 1991 season were a sally port of the original phase near one of the circular towers, and at the S end of the enceinte, a large gate, again of the original phase. Lying outside it was a monolithic block with a carving of Priapos, which from its shape had probably fallen from the arch of the gate. (ADelt 329-31) Komnena: Mytikas (14km NW of Xanthe). From a wide area in this locality have come many different categories of chance finds representing every period from EIA up to and including Byz. D. Triandaphyllos reports that four trenches were set out in its highest part. Pits and pithoi were found which contained collections of objects. In one of two pithoi (robbed) were 15 loomweights, mostly pyramidal, a reeded kantharos with painted decoration lacking its base and handles, a spindle- whorl and a headless seated clay figurine of Kybele. One of two pits cut in the stereo contained fragments of pithoi and other clay and glass vessels, loomweights, lead clamps, and the broken remains of two unusual quite large clay sculptures. One was a coiled-up clay snake lacking its head and tail, and the other was a naked male figure reclining on an irregular oval surface with three snakes, one round his neck, one wound round his left leg and one with its head against his right side. It was obviously a votive offering appropriate to a sanctuary of Asklepios, but no such sanctuary is known in the district at present. One trench had only a stone heap covering a large rubbish pit which contained, inter alia, four bronze LR coins, two double-pronged iron tools, an iron sickle and a large iron animal bell. As well as the four main trenches, 31 small tests were dug over the wider area. Most struck stereo at 0.40-0.80m and only four produced any archaeological result. The most interesting was a mid-5th Ct BC built cist. A geomorphological survey of the whole area between the village of Komnena and the Macedonian tomb of Stavroupolis was planned. (AEMTH 7, 607-11) Lagena (near the W bank of the Evros and the railway line, 14km S of Souphli). The village authorities excavated the top of this burial tumulus illegally in order to set up a cistern. The tumulus had already had an army machine-gun post built on it 20 years previously. The tumulus was ca 40m in diameter and 4.40m high. Rescue excavations proceeded from its S side. The tomb, oriented NW-SE, had a built dromos, partly roofed. The machine had cut away part of the W wall of the antechamber, and the W wall and part of the S wall of the chamber, and most of its floor. The ante-chamber measured 2 x 1.97m. The remaining wall foundations of the chamber, situated exactly between the machine-gun post and the cistern, measured 2.90m, 3.07m and 2.34m. On the E side of the chamber there were the remains of a destroyed bench, and in its SE corner was a hollow cut in the floor, probably for libations. In the NE of the chamber an amphora containing cremated bone had survived intact. Outside the dromos ceremonial pyres with sherds and animal bones were found. From the disturbed earth in the tomb were recovered iron nails, bits of lead, scraps of bronze objects, remains of gilded bronze and clay wreaths, a bone needle, plaster and bones. The tomb had been robbed and much of its building material removed before the machine-gun post and the cistern were built. The installation of the machine-gun post had done only minor damage, as the tomb walls were at a lower level; but the excavation for the cistern caused irreversible destruction. On the basis of the remains of its architecture, the amphora which survived, and sherd material in the fill, the tomb is dated to the 4th Ct BC. It is the fourth Macedonian tomb to be found in Thrace, and had it survived, might well have been considered the finest of them. (ADelt 334-6) Loutros: anc. Traianopolis. A large tumulus 1.5km NW of the anc. city was attacked by antiquities thieves, who dug a shaft from its apex to a depth of 12m in the hope of locating a tomb-fortunately without success. The following rescue exca- vation discovered a peribolos of unworked stones (diam. 10m) covered by a stone heap, under the centre of the tumulus at ground level. Around the peribolos were remains of eight sites of funeral ceremonies with traces of pyres, sherds, pots, animal bones, carbonized seeds and other small finds.</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 89 The stone heap covered two large cremations, A and B, the latter surrounded by a circle of stones. Each was accompanied by large numbers of lavish possessions, the bronze vessels being outstanding, e.g. a bronze cooking pot from cremation B with two different types of handle, one with a bull's head and the other with a small child sculpted in the round with inset silver eyes. Each cremation had a gold ring, A with an eagle engraved on a stone of chalcedony, and B with a corelian with Apollo playing his lyre. Both had weapons, A an iron sword with ivory hilt plates, and B an iron two-pronged trident and iron spear-heads. Among many other finds perhaps the most interesting were doctors' caskets. That of A was semi-circular, and had been made of wood plated with ivory (which had calcified in the fire). It had a bronze lock and fittings, an iron key and bronze suspension links. Inside was a bronze compartment with a flat stone in the bottom and internal divisions; there was also a cylindrical case containing medical instruments. B had both a semi-circular casket, like A's, with iron chains still in its suspension rings, and another similar but rectangular small chest. A silver denarius of Domitian (AD 81-96) was with A, but the two cremations and the construction of the tumulus should perhaps be dated to the early years of the 2nd Ct AD when the Emperor Trajan founded the city bearing his name. (ADelt 333-4) Makre (llkm W of Alexandroupolis, near the sea). Two sectors of this toumba have been excavated every year since 1988; sector A has remains of the historical period, and sector B, N remains; N strata also underlie sector A. In 1991 in sector A two rectangular areas defined by walls of unworked stones standing up to 2m in height, which were apparently apotheteis, contained pointed-base amphoras and other pots of the 5th and 4th Cts BC. Immediately below one of these was a large N anthropomorphic pot. S of these structures a very long R wall had its foundation cut into N levels. Sector B, which was not overlaid by later remains, produced very well-preserved N levels, with rectangular houses with pise walls outlined by post-holes; also unusual clay installations as well as the customary hearths and ovens, and quantities of pottery and other finds not far below the surface. There was one area apparently set aside for storage, with appropriate vessels. In 1991, under the floor of a house to the S of this area, three burials were discovered. Only one was well preserved. The body had been placed in a tightly-contracted position with its hands in front of its face and a heavy stone on its chest. A small green stone with it was probably an ornament. The burials were also accompanied by animal bones, chiefly sheep/goat jaws, and shells. These are the only N burials so far found in E Macedonia and Thrace. (ADelt 331-2). Until 1992, the Makre N settlement was believed to be basically a one-period site dated to the 5th millennium BC, and equivalent to Sitagroi I-II, Paradimi I-II, Karanovo III-IV in Bulgaria, and in Turkey, the upper stratum of Hocacesme and Ilipinar V. In 1993 a deep sounding in one trench encountered an earlier destruction level where bedrock had been expected, and below it a phase with pottery different from, though not necessarily unrelated to, that found in the strata above. Much interest attaches to this, as it may prove to be EN, a period usually lacking in other related sites. (D. Ourem-Kotsos and N. Efstratiou, AEMTH 7, 619-24) Maroneia. The construction of a road between Platanite, to the W of the anc. site, and the harbour at Agios Charalambos, caused the SW part of Maroneia to be investigated for the first time. In 1992, E. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzepolychroni found parts of two buildings, occupied from the 2nd half of the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC. The better-preserved had a peristyle court, with rooms still extant on its N and W sides. The N rooms had been floored with mosaics, of which only the substructure remained, and their walls had had coloured plaster. The W rooms may have been of more domestic character. One room was partly floored with clay tiles and had a pithos in a comer. Another had a cobbled floor, through which a stone drain led to the exterior of the building. In a corer of the courtyard was a curious large rectangular shallow hollow, lined with broken roof tiles and large sherds, with a smaller square construction lined with tiles beside it. (AEMTH 6, 633-7) In 1993, N. Kokkotaki and Ch. Karadima describe the results of another excavation necessitated by the same road. They found parts of a large (public?) building, or more probably two buildings, divided by a road. Both buildings have small buttresses at intervals along their interior walls. Finds included quantities of plain and bg pottery, roof-tiles, lamps, figurines (one of Athena), stamped amphora handles and coins. The dating and the orientation (NE-SW) were the same as those of the buildings found the previous year, and indeed all houses found at Maroneia so far are on the same axis. In 1993 also, a small excavation took place at Agios Athanasios, once the acropolis of the anc. city, but since the 1960s occupied by an airforce installation. The work was in connection with a new topographical plan of the site. Part of the fortification wall and the poor remains of a quadrangular building noted by Prof. G. Bakalakes in the 1950s were cleared, but the nature and extent of the air force buildings did not allow a full investigation of the area. (AEMTH 7, 637-41) Maroneia. Palaiochora. Systematic excavation of the site established that part of a floor mosaic previously uncovered there belonged to an atrium stoa of a 6th-Ct AD basilica built on top of an earlier R building. The variety and vividness of the geometric and foliate mosaic decoration (including birds, baskets, flowers and vessels) indicate that the basilica would have been of a monumental nature. After destruction, the site was used as a cemetery and many spolia were used for the graves themselves. Part of the Byz city of Maroneia extended over the basilica/ cemetery, and some domestic buildings (with storerooms, hearths, ovens and courtyards) were also excavated. The two- storey building III of this phase is of exceptional interest in terms of construction, size, location, and finds. The latter finds date habitation to between the 10th and 13th Cts. (ADelt 357-8) Mesembria. P. Tsatsopoulou describes part of a large building block in the NW part of the city. In three buildings within the block were found rooms containing amphoras. The largest group consisted of 129 amphoras, organized in 12 x 11 rows. They stood rim-downwards, and most were intact. The rooms where the amphoras were found had no doors, and in the case of the large group, there was no passage space left so it was unlikely to have been a store-room. It is thought that they might have been a device to prevent damp and ground-water from reaching the main floor. A total of 188 amphoras was recovered. Many were Chiot, of end 6th-5th Cts BC. About a third had tarred interiors. None had a stamp. Another unusual find in the same area was a complete ithmos, a clay disc 0.96m in diameter, pierced with small holes set in 16 concentric circles, and with a slightly raised rim. It was</page><page sequence="90">90 DAVID BLACKMAN probably used for straining the must after the grape-pressing. The same archaeologist puts the case that the site known for the last 26 years as Mesembria may in fact be anc. Zone, the most important colony of the Samothracian Peraia. The suggestion is based on the study of over 2,000 coins, and on topographical considerations. (AEMTH 6, 669-73) Myrodato: Bairitsa (6km NW of Abdera). Antiquities thieves broke into a well-made cist tomb in this known cemetery. The bones and an Ionian banded kylix with high handles and a low ring base were thrown outside the tomb. (ADelt 329) Papikion Oros. Lenos. Continuing investigation of this impor- tant site revealed a three-aisled basilica (21 x 8.80m) which served as the katholikon of a monastery, along with an adjacent cistern. The nave preserves much of its original marble floor along with some opus sectile work, including a depiction of the 'five loaves' motif. The existence of a dome (est. 3.50m diam.) was confirmed by buttresses and remains of the marble base of the drum. Investigation determined three general phases for the monument: the first phase consisted of the nave, aisles and sanctuary, the nave defined by piers. The exterior walls of this structure were covered in plaster which was incised or painted to resemble cloisonne masonry technique. The second phase involved the building of the narthex, and the third the exonarthex. The basilica, however, was built on top of and incorporated an earlier, smaller basilica. Wall-painted decoration included much marbling and widespread use of geometric motifs. Fragments of faces of the Evangelists were also found, proba- bly from the pendentives of the original church. Interestingly, wall-painting fragments with faces of saints (probably from the earlier church) were used intentionally to pack the buttress wall, either to protect them or to act as enkainia. The wall-paintings themselves appear to have had two phases and the style of painting used for garments indicates, along with the opus sectile floor, that the artists/craftsmen probably came from Constantinople. Coins and pottery date the foundation of the monastery as it stands today to the 11th Ct, with its activity ending in the 14th. The wall-paintings and mar- ble floor date to the 12th, a period of flourishing activity in the region as a whole. The impressive cistern, built into the ground, stored water from adjacent springs, and was reached by steps from ground level. It is a square structure supported by four piers, and prob- ably dates from the phase during which the exonarthex was added to the katholikon, thus indicating increased activity in the monastery. (ADelt 355-7) Pentalophos (33km NW of Orestiada). After a low tumulus 3km NE of the village suffered illegal excavation, it was inves- tigated by D. Triantaphyllos in 1993. The digging machine had cut through the centre of the tumulus, a stone heap (diam. 8m) and a ceremonial pyre, and had reached the top of a rectangu- lar pit grave cut in the soft bedrock. The stone heap had a large slab set upright towards one edge, probably a grave marker. The pyre, largely destroyed by the machine, contained burnt wood, a bronze stud, a few sherds and bones and half a clay spindle-whorl. The grave retained the remains of a cremation (charcoal, ash and bones), bronze studs, fragments of an iron knife and a sil- ver two-obol coin of Sparadokos (445-435 BC), the brother of Sitalkes, king of the Odrysians. It had a horse's head and the letters ZIIA on one side and an eagle with a snake in its beak within a recessed square on the other. It is the first time a coin of Sparadokos has been found in Greek Thrace, though they are known in Bulgaria. In the N part of the tumulus, two groups of funerary offer- ings were found, one with amphora sherds, the other with ani- mal bones. On the basis of the coin, the amphora sherds, and a few bg fragments, the tomb and tumulus are provisionally dated to the end of the 5th Ct BC. Two of a group of four tumuli to the SE of the village were also excavated. Within one of them a stone heap covered two burials with poorly-preserved skeletons. Near these, a ceremo- nial pyre contained animal bones, two bronze beads and a small bg balsamarium with a spherical body of the second half of the 3rd Ct BC. The other tumulus proved to be a cenotaph, with funerary offerings in three places, but no grave, and no datable material. (AEMTH 7, 605-7, 611) Rizia: Agios Nikolaos (15km NNW of Orestiada). About 600m NE of the village is an EIA settlement (9th-8th Cts BC) and a later tumulus (diam. 30m; height 7m). The tumulus was made from the ruins of the settlement, which was further destroyed by earth-levelling operations and soil removal. The tumulus' earth produced quantities of EIA pottery with incised, channelled and impressed decoration, also a few unbroken small pots, clay spindle-whorls, segments of clay plaster, lumps of clay from destroyed floors, a clay 'anchor' and animal bones. In one place parts of two successive EIA floors and a post-hole were preserved. Near the SE edge of the tumulus, a rectangular cutting 1.82 x 0.50 x depth 0.30m was found with a cremation within it. The poor grave goods included two bronze coins, one of which was from the Adrianoupolis mint in the reign of Septimius Severus (AD 193-211). This humble tomb was the only one found beneath the great tumulus. A possible hypothesis is that the main burial might have been discovered and destroyed during earlier earth removal from the NW part of the tumulus, but this will now always remain unknown. (ADelt 337-8) Rodope Plain Survey. The Komotini Ephorate initiated a surface survey of prehistoric sites in Aegean Thrace in 1991. The Rodope Plain was chosen as the first area to be studied, and because of its extent work in the first two seasons concentrated on its SE end, in the area of the Lissos and its tributaries the Skylorema and the Lykorema. The geological and geomorphological study of the district planned to precede surface collection, in fact located flints in a number of places along the ravines of the streams and on low terraces in the vicinity of Krovyle village. Initial study by Dr E. Adam suggets the presence of a MPal flint industry, with a local source of raw material at Petrota. This is the first identification of Pal remains in Aegean Thrace. The survey is being carried out by N. Efstratiou of Thessalonike University with graduate students of the university, with the participation of Prof A. Ammerman of Colgate University, New York. (N. Efstratiou, AEMTH 6, 643-52) Samothrace: Keramidaria (5km E of Palaiopolis, on the island's N shore). The presence of an extended group of anc. potteries here has been known since the construction of the shore road in the '70s partly destroyed them. Trials took place in 1989 and 1991 in the dump of a pottery producing HL amphoras, and in a later workshop, which had visible remains in the road cutting. Three kilns belonging to another workshop were excavated 500m farther E; these were of the rectangular type and may have been part of a larger group.</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 91 The amphora dump contained an impressive variety of styles which chiefly imitated Thasian prototypes. A great number (ca 1,300) had stamped handles with the names and emblems of archons, or initials. The pottery producing the amphoras is dated to the second half of the 4th and part of the 3rd Cts BC, while the workshops generally seemed to have continued in use at least until the early Imperial period. (ADelt 338) Palaiopolis N. Cemetery. In 1992 an extension to the telephone company network necessitated a small excavation in this cemetery. Ch. Karadima and M. Koutsoumanis report that 31 burials were discovered: 19 tile graves, two cist graves, one pit grave, two stone sarcophagi and seven burials in amphoras. The graves dated from 6th Ct BC to 1st CtAD. The earliest enchytrismos was in an SOS amphora, which contained a bg trefoil-lipped oinochoe and the bones of an infant. The rest were in plain pointed-base amphoras. The earliest of the 19 tile graves (mid- 4th Ct BC) was unusual in the number of its grave goods, which included a complete figurine of a dancer with a rattle or castanets in either hand, a bronze mirror, two silver hair-coils, part of a gold ornament, six squat lekythoi, and sherds from a clay alabastron. Most of the other tile graves were HL. One of the two monolithic sarcophagi contained three adult burials with grave goods of end 3rd/first half of the 2nd Ct BC. Thirteen of the graves were without offerings. (AEMTH 6, 677-9) Mantal'Panagia (2km N of Prophetes Elias, in the S central part of the island). D. Matsas, Ch. Karadima and M. Koutsoumanis report on an area 250m NW of the chapel of Mantal'Panagia which has been noted for rich surface finds since 1893. These include Thracian pottery, bronze fibulae, female terracotta and marble figurines, Attic, Cor and E Greek pottery and other objects dating approximately 8th Ct BC to 2nd Ct AD. The sanctuary of a female deity seemed to be indicated. Trial excavations have so far uncovered a small MByz chapel with the apse of another larger, earlier (ECh?) basilica to the E of it, and a rectangular structure of unknown date to the NW of these. (AEMTH 7, 647-52) James R. McGredie reports on study of materials from excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samothrace, carried out by the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, for the ASCS in 1996: "Study and maintenance were conducted in the storerooms in the museum and on the site: Stoa: the foundation of the stoa was examined for dowel cuttings and pour channels to ascertain the way in which construction of the euthynteria progressed. Hall of Choral Dancers (former Temenos): (a) Dry-rubble retaining walls were constructed both S of the SW comer of the building and in the gaps in its N foundation in order to protect the foundations and regularize the site. Minor site conservation was carried out in consultation with the Ephorate. (b) Marble blocks from the excavations of 1949-1951 were re-identified and labelled. (c) All ceiling beams and geison-sima blocks from those excavations were re-measured and the basic scheme of the roof worked out. (d) Detached fragments of the SE corer geison-sima block were reattached and the block made ready for exhibition. (e) All the pottery recovered in 1994 and 1995 was studied and described. Museum: (a) Pottery on exhibit, which had been restored with obsolete techniques, was disassembed and restored according to present standards. (b) Architectural restorations whose appearance had deteriorated were repainted. (c) Metal objects in the museum and in storage were surveyed, those requiring treatment were treated, and all were protected. General: (a) Text and illustrations for now revised and enlarged Greek and English editions of the Guide prepared and checked against the museum and the site. It should be ready for the summer of 1997. (b) Various vegetation and washed dirt were cleaned from various parts of the site, to supplement the work done by the Ephorate. (c) Under the supervision of the Ephorate, a new series of photographs made with the aid of a hot-air balloon was prepared". Sarakene: Tsouska (35km NE of Komotini). The excavation of this small IA site was completed in 1991. It was probably an agricultural and stock-breeding settlement. (ADelt 331) Anc. Stryme: Metriko. As part of a programme of investigating threatened tumuli, in 1992 D. Triantaphyllos excavated four in this district, part of the cemetery of anc. Stryme. Most were of the low type, and in danger of being ploughed away. All tombs had been robbed, but interesting finds remained. These often came from areas of funerary offerings within the tumuli rather than from the rifled graves. Though stone sarcophagi and one child's tile grave were found, the typical tomb in the tumuli seems to have been a very well-made cist in which thick stone slabs were fitted together in a manner reminiscent of carpentry, and held in place with metal clamps. The cover fitted over a thin projection round the top of the tomb. In one case there was evidence that the interior had been painted, red predominating, with some black and an unidentifiable design. Among note- worthy finds were three kantharoi of the St. Valentine type, and a pair of terracotta figurines representing an old man and woman from tumulus A; and a white-ground lekythos and a squat rf lekythos showing a woman spinning from tumulus B. These two tumuli are dated to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC. (AEMTH 6, 655-60) The same archaeologist excavated Tumulus E in 1993. The grave was the type of cist described above, robbed. There were six sites of funerary offerings within the tumulus, one on the lid of the tomb itself. Pottery included two fine white-ground lekythoi attributed to the workshop of the Reed Painter, and many bg vessels, dated to the second half of the 5th Ct BC. (AEMTH 7, 601-5) NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS Chios. A large part of the activities of the 20th Ephorate in 1991 was absorbed by the re-organization and re-opening of the Mytilene Museum. Since 1985 the museum building had housed the Ministry of the Aegean. The Minister of Culture, Tz. Tzannetakis, presided over the official re-opening of the Museum in June 1991. Chios: town. Rescue excavation in the Atsikis district on the Vasileiou plot brought to light part of a house of HL date. Finds here included much coarse ware, many bg sherds, parts of stamped amphora handles, sherds from Megarian bowls, West Slope ware, lamps, bronze coins, loom weights and fragments of figurines. Odos Kaloplytou: in the W part of the Tsoukari plot were found remains of house F. A terminus post quem for the earliest of three building phases was provided by sherds of HL date, found beneath the red-plastered floor of the house. The central and NE part of the site was occupied by house A, dating to the 2nd Ct BC: red plaster floors and traces of wall-painting survive. Finds included coarse ware, bg, West Slope ware and Chiot pottery of the 2nd Ct BC. Also found were lamps, loom</page><page sequence="92">92 DAVID BLACKMAN weights and 69 bronze coins. Building B is dated to the ECh period: floors here were marble-tiled and the walls were coated with lime plaster. Finds included coarse ware, cooking pots with grooved decoration and a plate with incised cross. On the Frangaki plot on Odos Letsaina, in the district of the Panagia Letsaina, were discovered anc. building remains, the lowest levels of which can be dated to the A period. Here were found a mass of sherds from Chiot vessels, loom weights, a bronze armlet and fragments of bf vases decorated with various scenes. From the upper levels came HL pottery. The presence of shapeless lumps of unbaked clay, the mass of sherds, and 28 identical lamps suggests the existence of a ceramic workshop in this area. In the district of Agios Ioannis Prodomos, on the Pyrgelli plot, were found graves belonging to the HL cemetery of the town. Seven cist graves, constructed of stone from Thymiana, and three tile graves were oriented E-W. Grave offerings included hydriae, an oinochoe, unguentaria, iron strigils, bronze coins and iron nails. From the excavation rubble was recovered a marble cinerary ur with lid. At Odos Agiou Ioanni Prodomou, on the Athinaios plot, rescue excavation uncovered an anc. pebble floor with tile-built hearth. To west of this were found redeposited bones belonging to at least ten persons, together with an equal number of skulls. Broken offerings included clay and glass unguentaria of Roman date, bronze coins and fragments of golden wreaths. In the Frangomachala district, at Odos Konst. Monomachou, on the Gatana plot were found two disturbed graves of post- Byz date. Grave I is a cist grave, oriented E-W, and containing a child burial. Grave II is stone-built, and covered with slabs of Thymiana stone. On the Leontara plot at Favierou and Mouseiou were un- covered twenty-three graves belonging to the HL cemetery of the town of Chios. These were oriented E-W. Out of 23, 18 were cist graves built of Thymiana stone and covered with flat or monolithic slabs. Eight of the graves were built in pairs, each pair sharing a common long side, and may represent the graves of married couples. From grave VI was recovered a bronze hydria ash urn. Grave X was a tile grave, and graves XI and XVII were empty and disturbed. All the graves were supplied with unguentaria, small clay hydriae, and iron strigils. In grave VIII was found a gold band with relief decoration and in grave XVI a gold coin and leaves from a gold wreath. In Odos Rizari trenching for water and sewage works uncovered part of a triple conduit construction running W-E. The conduit is composed of three parallel walls, carefully constructed and incorporating re-used architectural elements. The total length revealed was 2.14m and its width measured 0.85m. It was covered with stone slabs. South of the conduit and at a distance of about 15.60m from it were found three cist graves, oriented E-W. The graves had been disturbed by previous trenching works at the site, and in each grave the bones were piled together and belonged to more than one person. Offerings included unguentaria, iron strigils, ivory pins, bronze coins, glass vessels, a pair of gold earrings, and a thin round gold disc bearing an engraved representation of a kantharos. (ADelt 360-2) Lemnos Myrina. Rescue excavation took place in the district of Richa Nera on the site of the Officers' Club, which is located on the W edge of the archaeological site of the EBA settlement of Myrina. Rescue excavation followed the unfortunate digging by the Officers' Club of two large cess-pits, which caused dam- age to the antiquities and the loss of valuable information. Parts of three building phases were discovered, the earliest of which dates to the N period. To this phase belong house walls T16 and T17: that this area was connected with food preparation is shown by the mass of burnt bones, oysters and sea urchins. The second building phase belongs to the BA and preserves curved wall T15 and walls T13 and T14, all house walls. Beside wall T15 was excavated a deposit containing fine quality BA pottery. This phase is contemporary with the Poliochni black period. The third building phase preserves a small part of a paved floor and remains of wall r9, which bounds the floor on the E, and of wall r7, which was built above curved wall l15. This phase can be dated to the end of EBI, contemporary with the Poliochini green and red period. In the Tsas district, on the Pontiki plot, trial trenches the previous year had revealed parts of a HL potter's workshop. Rescue excavation was now carried out at the site. Finds included moulds for figurines and for Megarian bowls decorated with mythological scenes, stamps bearing mythological scenes and leaf motifs, and many amorphous lumps of clay bearing the finger prints of the potter. It is of interest to note that all the Megarian bowls and other vases were marked by defects, either of shape or in the rendering of the relief decoration. This area may therefore represent the workshop dump. About 2km distant from Myrina, excavation work was com- menced in the Avlonas district on the Tratarou plot. Already visible on the ground surface here were anc. building remains and HL sherds. In this first year of work, excavation covered an area of about 2.8 str. To the S, excavation revealed building remains belonging to three construction phases: HL, LC and A. To the HL period belongs the building complex occupying the whole of the S area. Rectangular in shape and oriented SW-NE, its preserved dimensions measure 27.5 x 14.5m. Paved floors survive in most of the rooms, and elsewhere floors are of stamped earth. The outer surface of the walls are built of medium-size, semi-worked stones, with smaller stones provid- ing the fill. The presence of reused material is widespread, such as a plaque of 4th-Ct BC date with the inscription OPOS APTEMIAOS. A number of areas can be designated as storage areas, thanks to the presence of rectangular or trapezoidal 'chests', built from flimsy walls leaning against the corer walls of the rooms with earth floors. The HL structure is built above the remains of A walls T 47 and T 48, which bound floor A 9. Walls T38, T 41, T 60, T 63, T 62 and floor A 12, built above the A floor, can be dated to the LC phase. The walls of the SW part of the HL structure were built above the LC walls, and part of T 60 was used in the HL building. The deposit was characterized by layers of red clay earth, indicative of the construction of the building from unbaked brick. In the N of the site was found an apsidal building of A date, with long axis running SE-NW. Only its apse and its NE side were preserved. Its preserved length and width measured 27 and 1 lm respectively. Below the apsidal building lies an earlier A aspidal building. Wall 86 is later, and encircles a large rock in the area of the destroyed E section of the apsidal building. In the area bounded by wall T 86, in an A deposit between the rock and the wall of the aspidal building, was found a calf offered for sacrifice, with its legs bound. N of the A building were found remains of further walls which belong to a later building, contemporary with the HL structure which occupies the S part of the site. The R period was represented by some building remains and by a tile grave. At a distance of 2m from the tile grave were found the remains of a baby. The excavation continues. (ADelt 369-72)</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 93 In July 1991 the Italian School of Archaeology recommenced work at the prehistoric settlement of Poliochni and its environs, undertaking geophysical, geoarchaeological and topographical surveys and consolidating architectural remains. In order to define the settlement's extent and the area exploited in antiquity, a geoarchaeological survey was conducted between Agia Sophia to the S and Kaminia to the N and between the coastal mountain to the W and the sea to the E. The morphology of the area is being characterized and hypotheses are being put forward for the various changes during the PR to historic periods, as well as reconstructing the evolution of the hydrography of the region. Geophysical prospection has recognized a tectonic fissure in the middle of the settlement and such techniques should enable the investigation of Poliochni's older and more problematic phases without having to destroy data from overlying strata. Amongst the surface anomalies distinguished were likely Med graves beside the Chapel of St. George. An unnatural concentration of stones and slabs at the 'Athanasios' vineyard' site, currently provides the only possible indication of the PR settlement's associated necropolis; however, this can only be verified by test trenching. Due to a large part of the area surrounding Poliochni being covered by crops, it was only possible to re-examine and collect surface material from other EBA sites on the island, specifically those previously recorded (albeit with little description) by Bernabo-Brea. The location and study of Axia, Trochalia, Briokastro and Mikro Kastelli, has allowed the settlement type of EBA Lemnos to be characterized: usually coastal, situated either on headlands or small hills with a large agricultural hinterland. All sites of this period from the island's E side conform to this type and investigation of those located on the W side of Lemnos has now begun. A 1:5000 soil map has also been made, to estimate the region's agrarian potential and demarcate the area covered by the survey. Similarly, detailed mapping at 1:200, 1:500 and 1:5000 is incorporating new features and station points have been established near to the school building, in the area of the excavation and that surrounding Poliochni. (ADelt 373-4) In 1996 the Italian School worked only at Hephaistieia, on conservation of the HL bath installation excavated in 1926 by Laurenzi and uncovered again in 1995; a second room was found. Two shelters were built: over the water tanks of the baths and over the 'tower' in the walls excavated by Adriani in 1930 and uncovered in 1995. Lesbos Mytilene. Rescue excavation in the Chrysomallousas district, off Odos Asklipiou (Papadopoulou, Vastagou, Sarantou and Zografaki plots) revealed anc. building remains. Several of the walls were built above cist graves of HL date. In total six graves were excavated, all disturbed and containing mostly more than one burial. Also recovered was a grave stele preserving the inscription: KAAAII ANHIZ TPO/TQNOS XAIPE. Work on the Kontara and Pastou plot on Odos Korarou in the Epano Skala district continued that begun by the 3rd Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. Under investigation was a R period building, part of which is still in use today as a storage area by the neighbouring car repair shop. Opening off both sides of a corridor with mosaic floors are two apsidal rooms with tiled floors. To S and W of the rooms run vaulted corridors which lead to chambers now located beneath neighbouring buildings. The W corridor was cleared of its earth fill down to the level of the anc. earth floor. Also cleared was the basement level of the S corridor. The deposit consisted almost exclusively of building materials with very little sherd material, mainly of post-Byz date. Also found here were the bones of at least two persons. In room Ay the lowest stratum contained some sherds of late R date. The excavation continues. Trenching for water and sewage works revealed antiquities in several locations: Rescue excavation at Odos Aginoros uncovered part of a wealthy house of late HL date, with an atrium paved with an excellently preserved mosaic floor (maximum preserved dimensions 4.15 x 5.7 m). In the centre of the floor, placed within a medallion set in a rhombus, is depicted a sea deity from whose hair protrude lobster legs and dolphin tails. On the four exterior sides of the rhombus are depicted the four seasons. To the W of the atrium is preserved part of a corridor, also paved with a mosaic representing a winged dragon set within a rectangular frame 2.4 x 1.7m. At the E edge of the atrium is an open channel for drainage of rain water. To the S is located a cistern with tiled bottom, accessible by steps on its N and E sides. To the house also belonged a well and a small vaulted cistem. Finds included sherd material, many fragments of coloured plaster, pieces of marble facing, many coins and fragments of lamps and figurines. At the junction of Tsimiski and Ioustinianou was discovered part of an anc. road, oriented N-S, and of a house, oriented E-W. On Odos Kratinou was found the remains of an anc. marble wall, constructed in pseudo-isodomic style and oriented NE-SW. It clearly belonged to a wealthy dwelling, though unfortunately investigation of the whole structure was impossible since it lies partly under the moder road and houses. At Odos Herakleias came to light part of a badly damaged polychrome mosaic floor, with maximum preserved dimensions of 3.5 x 2.5m. Representations of the head of a youth, erotes and a panther survive. On Odos Sigeiou part of a R bath building was revealed. Its exact dimensions could not be ascertained since it is partly overlaid by modem structures. A small section of hypocaust is preserved at the junction of Sigeiou and Krinis, and to the S of the hypocaust were found two rooms with marble-tiled floors. Stretches of plastered wall survive. Finds here included two relief decorated cuirasses, fragments of marble sculptures and of terracotta figurines, and pottery of R date. To the S of the rooms were three cisterns, the most northerly of which was apsidal and coated with waterproof plaster. The two other cisterns were rectangular and were connected by a pipe: their walls preserved traces of waterproof plaster and their floors were constructed from marble slabs. Finds from the cisterns included fragments of figurines, coins, two bronze medallions and a large quantity of pottery. To the S were found walls and floors belonging to ancillary rooms of the bath building. The deposit here contained pieces of pithos and other coarse ware sherds, in addition to figurine fragments and coins. On Odos Proussis came to light part of a terrace wall, T1, oriented N-S, with its E face constructed in pseudo-isodomic style. It was cut by walls T4, T5, T7 and T8 to create a small house. The deposit here was rich in coarse ware pottery and also in bg sherds from kyathoi, kantharoi, skyphoi, plates and lamps. Also found were loom weights, coins and figurine fragments, all of HL date. Excavation, begun the previous year, was completed of the antiquities located in the courtyard of the House of Halim Bey in the Kioski district. Remains of anc. domestic architecture here belong to at least two phases of construction, the earlier</page><page sequence="94">94 DAVID BLACKMAN dating to the late HL period and the later to late antiquity. Also found was part of the drainage system of the late HL period and, in addition, well deposits I and IV, both containing HL material. Cleaning was also undertaken in this area of medieval walls belonging to the fortifications of the castle. In many places the walls re-use anc. architectural elements. In the N part of the plot were found four graves dating to the Ott period. Also in the Kioski district trial trenches were excavated in the open area to the SE of the Ministry of the Aegean building. These produced building remains of the LR period, and a rescue excavation was undertaken to reveal parts of two rooms. The deposit produced many white, red and black plaster fragments, pieces of glass vessels and bg, red glaze and coarse ware pottery. Two dumps were also excavated, one containing HL figurine fragments and the other fine quality bg, red glaze and West Slope ware. The excavation continues. At Odos Bostani part of the S cemetery of the late HL and R town of Mytilene came to light during the laying of new telephone cables. Twenty eight graves were excavated. Graves I and XI contained clay sarcophagoi, VI and X were lined with tiles, and the rest were cist graves. All had been disturbed by the modern trenching works. Of particular interest was cist grave VIII which contained redeposited bones of earlier burials, together with their offerings: two lamps, fourteen vases, four glass unguentaria, a pair of gold earrings, a metal finger ring, a mirror and twenty three bronze coins. Small sections of wall found during the course of the excavation clearly belong to the peribolos wall of the cemetery. (ADelt 362-8) Dr H. Williams reports on work in 1995-96: "Study seasons at the University of British Columbia excavations at anc. Mytilene have made considerable progress on preparation for publication of material from both acropolis and N Harbour excavations, which includes some 10 tons of pottery, 1,500 lamps, more than 2,000 figurines, and a large amount of HL and R glass. Of particular interest is the discovery of an early R moulded bowl fragment with a scene of a veiled Heracles at the Eleusinian rites, very similar to the representation on the Lovatelli urn. Publication of the numerous Turkish clay pipes (dating from the 17th to 19th Cts) is now imminent and will make up one of the largest studies of these objects ever undertaken. Work on human and animal remains has also added considerably to our knowledge of aspects of the C to ER period and Med/Ott period on the acropolis. Of particular interest are the Genoese/Byz burials around the Gattelusi church on the acropolis; pathological analysis has revealed that most individuals suffered from food deficiencies in childhood as well as anaemia or malaria. Analysis of the large collection of animal bones from the Thesmophorion indicates a preponderance of piglet but with ovicaprids and a few cattle also represented." Methymna. During excavation works on the Hatzimarkou plot, which is located at the edge of the preserved settlement of anc. Methymna, remains belonging to two construction phases were discovered. To the upper levels belonged walls, dated to the post Byz period by their building style and by post Byz pottery. In the lower levels were found four walls, one of them a curved terrace wall, all dated to the A period, and burnt A pottery. The excavation continues. (ADelt 368) Skala Eresou. On the Kalabokidi plot were found cist graves belonging to the Byz cemetery. After the investigation of two graves the excavation was continued by the 3rd Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. (ADelt 369) CYCLADES AND SAMOS Delos. Francis Prost (French School) reports on sondages at the Archegesion (GD 74) in 1996: "Ten sondages were made in the ground covering the sanctuary of the Archegesion and the S flat area, with a grid covering a total area of 40 x 20m. Two test trenches, 1 and 4, were dug in the two areas likely to provide information about a hypothetical necropolis situated in the vicinity of the Archegesion. At the heart of the Temple of Anios, within the eschara defined by a circular wall and excavated down to bedrock by Jean Ducat in 1961, one can make out on the E side an oblong cavity cut in the poros which resembles, in spite of its wear, that of the tombs brought to light by Fernand Robert in 1935, as well as one end of a cavity, more to the N than the previous one and interrupted on the surface by the circular wall. Test trench 1 was intended to find out whether the end of the cavity really belonged to an oblong cavity comparable to those which were known elsewhere in the sanctuary of the Archegetes, or if it was of a quite different shape; not only was the visible part cleared up to the interior of the eschara but also the flooring composed of little slabs surrounding the space outside the circular wall was taken up to allow excavation down to bedrock. This cavity, it transpired, is not oblong but circular and three quarters of it lies under the circular wall. Outside this wall no cavity has been found. Given its shape, this cylindrical cavity is man-made, perhaps an unsuccessful attempt at digging a well which must have preceded the construction of the circular wall. After these operations the trench was filled in again: the small slabs were put back in their original position and consolidated. As for test trench 4, it was sunk to the E of the seven tombs excavated by F. Robert in 1935. The latter does not seem to have investigated the area, to judge by his excavation note- books or his writings: this is confirmed by trench 4 which very soon reached a layer of natural earth without any material, just above the porous rock. This rock presents a whole series of cavities, one of which could resemble the cavities of the nearby tombs but with smaller dimensions. In the course of their 1961 excavations J. Ducat and Cl. Vatin had brought to light a series of rooms, or at least their foundations, S of the Temple of Anios. In view of the finds they seem to be the rooms of a house. This supposition is confirmed by the three trenches (2,5 &amp; 7) which were dug in 1996 to the S of the foundations found in 1961. In trench 2 a ditch was discovered apparently cut naturally in the decomposing granite; this ditch, ca 2m deep, was full of ordinary pottery sherds as well as various other items (lamps, coins, nails, carbon, etc...). Trench 5, opened to the E of trench 2, yielded only a large slab placed flat on the decomposing granite. Finally trench 7, situated to the E of trench 5, made it possible to reveal completely the wall whose E end had appeared in the oblique trench dug by J. Ducat in 1961. Only the first foundation course survives, ending to the W in a destruction zone: the blocks are no longer aligned but scattered and even in a state of decomposition. Whatever it was, this wall must have formed the S boundary of the rooms: the visible walls, not only in trench 7 but also in the oblique trench of J. Ducat, do not continue towards the S. Apart from Ducat's 1961 trench, no test trenching has been done in the area delimited by the Temple of Anios on the N and by the Oikoi on the E. Trenches 3, 6, 8 and 9 were intended to find out the exact function of this area created by the disposition of the buildings of the sanctuary. Trenches 3 and 6 were dug</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 about 1.20m from the W facade of the S oikos, since this area presented a strip of raised ground as well as a certain number of aligned stones which suggested the presence of a building. In fact, it was only a shepherd's wall whose foundations did not penetrate the surface earth. On the other hand, in the lower layers wall foundations were revealed (anc. in view of the sherds found), cut in the rock itself and surviving to a second course of small granite blocks. The walls discovered formed in plan a sort of fork with two prongs on a S-N orientation. They do not form a room since the N side has no foundation for a wall which would complete the ensemble. The W foundation seems to have been destroyed: the blocks at the N end of this foundation have irregular gaps which is not the case with the N end of the E foundation, whose blocks come to a neat end. It is not clear where the foundation of the S wall, oriented S-N, ends. Trenches 8 &amp; 9, opened up to the W and N of these foun- dations, did not clarify the function of these walls. Finally a tenth trench, in the southernmost part of the area between the Oikoi and the temple, reached bedrock without any finds." Jean-Charles Moretti and Philippe Fraisse (French School) report on the work on the theatre undertaken in 1996. After the completion of the work on the theatre by R. Vallois in 1912, the cavea was still covered by hundreds of scattered blocks, roughly piled. Work on an inventory started last year. This year more than 800 pieces were numbered, identified, located and measured. As in 1995, the study of joins proved disappointing, doubtless because the destruction of the rows of seats was due not to abandonment but to demolition of their constituent elements. This is confirmed by the very mutilated state of most of these blocks and the marks on many of them left by tools which were used to cut them up. Except for the heaviest blocks, all of them were deposited in a store-room W of the theatre. Among them were recognized pieces from the seats and their fronts, from steps, from the backs of benches and from the plinth, orthostat and coping of the wall which lined the diazoma. In addition a detailed plan for the restoration of the stage building has been worked out. The territory of Delos. Michele Brunet and Pierre Poupet report on the 1996 season: "A campaign of test trenches in agricultural structures was carried out, coupled with survey and photo-interpretation work. The aim was to provide indispensable supplementary informa- tion for a monograph on the Delian chora. Excavation of a grain threshing area. This area, associated with an anc. farm S of the F terrace and measuring 16.20m in diameter, was dated to the beginning of the 1st Ct BC by a coin found in the fill of its foundation. A first trench enabled us to define in detail the construction of its enclosure wall and a sec- ond trench showed that there was no structure at its centre. The anc. working floor consisted of a sandy deposit whose property was to harden at its surface under the effect of moisture. It cov- ered to a depth of 0.15m the granite bedrock or, in places, a bed of small quarry stones. Excavation of terraced fields. Three test trenches were dug in terraced cultivated fields, two in the S of the island in a gran- ite context and one on the Patinioti peninsula in a gneiss terrain. Their sites were chosen on a double criterion: the best possible state of preservation of the field and its supporting wall, and the interest of the local ecosystem defined by the gradient and exposure of the slope and the current presence of water revealed by the vegetation. The stratigraphy of the first field, the highest of a stepped system to the S of Kato Vardia, shows that it was created by the artificial introduction of a layer of earth, 0.60m thick, at the end of the 6th Ct BC or very beginning of the 5th Ct BC (handles and rims of Attic bg skyphoi and cup-skyphoi were found near the substratum in the bottom of the trench). In its upper part, the soil contained a lot of gravel, some obsidian chips and quite a lot of HL sherds, all elements which seem to be the result of agricultural work; in turning up and scratching the surface of the field, the ploughing implements had buried rubble at a shallow depth and the pottery fragments come from a regular scattering of garbage or fertilizer, a practice well-attested by the texts and inscriptions. The top 35 cm of the stratigraphy correspond to slope colluvia which have progressively (over two millennia) sealed the surface of the anc. field. In the second field excavated, E of and below Kato Vardia, a complete study was possible of its supporting terrace wall, preserved in its entirety. The exterior face, 1.25m high, is built in rough polygonal masonry. The top of the wall is formed by a course of slabs about 0.35m wide, which cover the thickness of the two faces (0.65 m). This wall is distinctly pyramidal: the batter between the base and the top of the exterior facing is 0.15m and 0.45m for the back-facing, built of small stones irregularly arranged and built into deep layers of virgin soil. Finally, on the E side of the Patinioti peninsula near an anc. gneiss quarry, we excavated the second terrace (16m high) of a system of stepped terraces at the edge of the cliff. A cultivation layer of soil 0.30m thick covered a much disintegrated substra- tum of gneiss. In spite of its lack of depth, the soil is perfectly adapted for the cultivation of cereals, and barley in particular. Test trenches in a big reservoir basin. At an altitude of about 60m on the SW spur of Mt. Kinthos, at the foot of a huge granite cliff shaped like a shell which dominates the basin- shaped slopes of the bay of Foumi, we established the existence of a big basin-reservoir which gathers the water running down from the granite mass which overhangs it. This reservoir, now silted up, looks like a depression in the shape of a very open triangle lined on two sides by a thick dam wall; it occupies an area of 500m2and had a restored capacity of 2000 m3. A first test trench showed that the inside facing of the dam wall (0.70m thick) was covered by a hydraulic lining, and that the wall had been reinforced, at the beginning of the 1st Ct BC, by a buttress im wide. A second test trench within the basin gives us a complete and remarkably readable stratigraphic sequence of the silt sediments deposited to a depth of 1.50m on the bottom covered by a mortar containing tile. It is clear that the silting up of the reservoir took place gradually over a very long period, from the time that its regular upkeep was no longer assured: once the basin was not cleared out clay was deposited as long as the reservoir had water in it, followed by a progressive filling up of the depression, once it was out of the water. As no significant sherd was found, it is impossible for the time being to date absolutely or relatively the different phases of this sequence of deposits, but we hope that the analysis of macro-remains and the carbon, compared with the information provided by the ancient cartography, will allow us to work out at least the period at which this structure stopped functioning as a reservoir. The position of this huge rainwater reservoir above a slope terraced for cultivation leads one to suppose that it could have served of a sort of water-tower from which the fields below it were irrigated. If so, it must have had an outlet channel. We have located this in the N part of the reservoir, at the nearest point to the granite rock-face, a position dictated by the 95</page><page sequence="96">96 DAVID BLACKMAN topography of the slope. The outlet channel is 1.20m long and 0.54m wide, widening to 0.65m at its outlet towards the slope. Its walls, preserved to one course only, 0.40m high, are formed of large well-fitted parpens. Its bottom is paved and covered with mortar containing tile, identical to that on the bottom of the reservoir. This channel is placed about half way up the reservoir: thus only the upper part of the reservoir could be emptied. Unfortunately we did not find any evidence of the system of closing the channel. Against the reservoir an artificial ramp was built to serve as a roadway by dumping a fill of beach sand in which there were a few HL sherds. This ramp is bordered to the W by the first terrace field of a system of tiers which covers the slope down towards Fourni. On the slope and on the plain as far as the shore one can easily follow the controlled course of the 'stream' which flowed from the reservoir. The concentration of hydrophile vegetation producing circular patches makes one suppose the existence of other reservoirs of a smaller size set up all along its course. Finally, at its outlet which is more or less in the middle of the shore of Fouri bay, just N of the ruins where F. Robert proposed to place the Leukothion, we discovered a final reservoir, badly destroyed. This collection of remains shows very clearly the care devoted to the control of water in anc. Delos. The storage of a considerable volume of water at the very top of the sloping basin of Fouri bay seems, therefore, to have met two needs: they had at their disposal an open-air cistern serving as a drinking-place for livestock, and above all thanks to the outlet channel they could easily practise a form of agricultural irrigation by controlled gravitational discharge." Herakleia and Schinousa. Due to recent increased building activity in the region, studies were undertaken of two known HL fortresses in Herakleia and Schinousa in order to register them as archaeological sites for their protection. The former structure is situated upon the Kastro hill, overlooking Leivadi bay on Herakleia's NE side. The several building phases of the interior (predominantly HL), were difficult to distinguish as the site had been used up to World War II. Almost the entire wall was identified and two towers were located, one of rectangular plan on the W side, the smaller example to the NE. Both the towers and the wall are substantial structures, the latter 0.8m thick. The entrance was probably on the W side, possibly beside the larger tower. The Schinousa fortress sits atop the Profitis Elias hill on the island's SE side, occupying an area of ca 90 x 17m. Its wall was also ca 0.80m wide, with a core of small stones and earth and faced with large blocks. The two towers discovered were situated on the NE and S side of the acropolis, with traces of many buildings on the summit, including the ruins of a single-aisled basilica overlain by later structures. PR, HL (especially bg) and R surface sherds were collected, the latter including many unstamped amphora handles; the sherds were concentrated on the W slope of the hill. Most important, the Herakleia and Schinousa fortresses' intervisibility was confirmed. (ADelt 381-2) Kythnos. Press reports on the anc. city of Kythnos supplement recent details upon the site (AR 1995-96, 36). Finds from the acropolis sanctuary of Demeter Thermophoros (8th Ct BC to 1st Ct AD) included a kernos, part of a seated clay female figurine and a C kantharos with IEPA inscribed under its lip. Most of the many miniature vessels were Cor; however, Attic forms were also recovered, in particular bg hydriskai. Of the numerous lamps offered at the shrine, those of the C period came from Attica, whereas the HL examples were imported from Rhodes, Ephesos, Knidos and Delos. Characteristic were huge East Aegean lighting vessels with a diameter of 40cm. Figurines of water-bearers or hydria-bearers suggest rites of 0i6po0opia and purification, with moulds indicating a local figurine workshop. Certain finds suggest a direct connection with the shrines of Eleusis and it is noted that an inscription from Eleusis mentions the "T£xeFoxS" who came from Kythnos. This structure can now be added to the two shrines documented in 1836, and the recovery of two female seated figurines at another shrine at the N part of the settlement, furthermore, suggests that Artemis was possibly worshipped at the site, a goddess depicted upon Kythnian coins (Kathimerini, 1 &amp; 8.2.97). Melos. The press reported the discovery of an undisturbed ECyc circular rock-cut tomb at Ribari. It contained 55 vessels, including a triple kernos, a cylindrical pyxis with incised decoration and a bg askos with spiral decoration. Along with a nearby grave found in 1995, this burial is thought to form part of a cemetery spanning the mid- to late 3rd millennium BC. The press also reported traces of two submerged HL and R settlements discovered by the Underwater Ephorate off Adhamanta and to the S of Kimolos. The Baptistery at the Treis Ekklesies site, originally studied by C. MacKenzie (JHS 1897) was reinvestigated in 1991, only to find that much of what MacKenzie had recorded of the structure has disappeared into the buildings of neighbouring houses and farm walls. (ADelt 384-6) Mykonos. The press reported the Cycladic (21st) Ephorate's recent excavations near the town hall, the discovery of a por- phyry workshop on the small island of Strapodi and a Myc tholos tomb containing a large number of grave goods at Bryses. Naxos. B.K. Lambrinoudakis reports in Ergon 1996 (78-80) on the 1996 work of the AS in Grotta, where excavations were undertaken to the S of the excavation of 1980, close to Mitropouli Square. A wall was uncovered, the lower part constructed of gneiss and granite, whilst the upper visible section was made from reused marble HL architectural blocks (from dedications and tombs). It seems that this wall forms the remains of walls retaining the earth fill under the Roman town (2nd Ct AD), when the settlement expanded and occupied the area of the agora. Under this wall at the PG level was found a Latin inscription in capital letters. The upper surface of the wall is 2.78m above sea level. Town (Chora). New rescue excavations at Plithos revealed more of the extensive G to R cemetery (AR 1993-94, 68), including a large R poros sarcophagus from close to the Kambysi plot. With a lid of two schist slabs and a plastered interior, it contained five skeletons, 11 complete and three fragmentary glass vessels including perfume bottles, two broken bronze mirrors, bronze (trident) handles, ironwork and many bone objects such as pins, spindles, cosmetic spatulas and a large disc-shaped object with an upright lip. Architectural remains were also discovered, with an LR or ECh floor of square clay tiles bearing an incised diagonal cross in the site's southern sector. (ADelt 376-7) Three important Byz churches are newly reported on Naxos. The Panagia ton Arion lies in the Aries plain below Mt. Za, along with remains of a Byz settlement and of an anc. monument. The single-aisled church was originally</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 87 barrel-vaulted, had two layers of wall-painted decoration (poorly preserved 13th-Ct fragments are now in the 2nd Ephorate workshops in Athens) and presented finds of pottery and coins (Latin imitations) of the 13th Ct. (ADelt 386-7) The church Panagia e Kera dedicated to the Dormition in the Ammomaxe site represents an extremely important example of a tri-apsidal cross-in-square domed monument associated with the so-called transitional type of the 9th-lOth Ct. The low drum of the dome is almost square on the inside, with the corers suitably rounded. Instead of the central apse, the apse to the S preserves a one-stepped synthronon with a crude episcopal throne. All three apsidal chambers of the sanctuary area open onto the nave and aisles, and the S aisle is taken up largely by the natural bedrock. Evidence for wall-paintings exists in the bema, under the hardened whitewash now covering the walls. A ruined Byz ancillary structure exists to the S. (ADelt 387-8) The church of Agia Kyriake Kechron at Tripodes is of the domed Greek-cross variety of a type known in Naxos and may have so-called 'iconoclast' wall-paintings (a tiny fragment of foliate motifs was uncovered) under the whitewashed surface of the interior walls. (ADelt 388) Finally the church of Agios Ioannis Prodromos near the settlement of Damariona is a single-aisled mid-Byz church of great interest but in need of immediate conservation. Fragmentary traces of wall-paintings exists, but are in poor condition (in the apse a Deesis, a common feature of Naxiote churches). The church contains significant spolia from the temple of Demeter at Gyroulas, converted into a Ch basilica in the 6th Ct. (ADelt 386-90) Paros. Excavations were conducted in three areas of the anc. cemetery of Paroikia. The W and S section produced many more 5th-4th Ct burials: one with a clay 'lamp-holder' among the grave goods; a child's tomb of poros with an unusual marble toy known from literary sources as a 'rhombos'; numerous marble cremation urns; urns incised with the names of the dead; and many jar burials. Of the associated offerings rf lekythoi were common, along with bg vessels, and clay figur-ines including a dove and a girl on a dolphin (Figs. 87,88). Between the SW edge of the A cemetery and that of the C period a fallen stele was found. It had a roughly worked surface, a periteneia on three sides of one face and had been employed as the base of a cist grave from the beginning of the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct. It is considered to be the gravestone of a nearby large late 8th-Ct trapezoidal collective cist-grave, which was covered with schist slabs and produced ca 50 amphoras in two separate groups. These vessels contained the burnt and cleaned human bones, many being sealed with a Fig. 88 kylix or with a skyphos. The grave's W part was unpaved and empty, possibly looted. In the 1st half of the 7th Ct low transverse walls were con- structed above the tomb, in between which were placed child burials in vessels or cist graves, individual offerings and traces of fire. These are considered to be traces of ancestor worship, lasting about two centuries. The above-mentioned stele was probably connected with the collective grave, serving as a marker. Excavations on the southernmost edge of the LR cemetery produced a further five sarcophagi with relief decoration and three cist graves (AR 1995-96, 37). The former were in rows, orientated N-S, and placed upon high or low pedestals which in turn rested on paving. 1.75m to the NE was the apparently contemporary skeleton of a wild boar, which is considered similar to a Myc offering from Chora in Naxos. (ADelt 375-6) The Frangouli plot lies outside the city walls behind the present cemetery, close to the Kyriazanou plot (AR 1995-96, 37). Here a marble cist grave with a pedimental marble cover produced 7 burials, a glass 'tear bottle', five bone pins and a bronze mirror. A second cist grave of schist slabs contained a single burial with a HL lamp of the 3rd Ct BC. A further two graves were revealed, one badly damaged, the second containing two burials, the upper body placed on a secondary internal floor of schist slabs and accompanied by glass grave goods which had been shattered by the collapsed roof. A marble frieze with floral decoration was also found from this area. (ADelt 376) Finally, with support from the Ministry of the Aegean, the consolidation and conservation of the anc. cemetery in the Bitzi plot was completed, with new drainage facilities, the construction of a sea-defence wall, clearance of intrusive modem features, erection of new fencing and the provision of lighting. A study was also made to develop a small public square and information booth. (ADelt 379-81) Samos. Rescue excavations in Pythagoreion at the New Gymnasium site (Kampouropoulou plot), W of the E side of the wall of anc. Samos, revealed part of the Eupalinos Aqueduct, HL rock-cut tombs from the NW necropolis and a large cistern of the R aqueduct and group of HL mosaics to the W. At a depth of 6.5m below the original ground surface, the channel's course has been traced for over 25m, eventually heading S towards the Chisios river. The rock-cut channel is built up with cut poros blocks bonded by a light coloured mortar 12 courses high, the last five being corbelled. It has a rectangular cross-section, a total 97</page><page sequence="98">98 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 89 Fig. 90 height of 1.82m, with walls 0.2m thick, a maximum interior width of 0.4m and bears an open clay semi-circular pipe made of sections 0.7m long by 0.36m wide. The pipe's construction dates it to the A period, which given its position and route leads to the conclusion that it constitutes the E continuation of the Eupalinos Aqueduct. Similar constructions are found at the Spring of the Agiades from which water was brought to the nymphaeum at the S exit of the aqueduct (AR 1993-94, 68), and the group of A cisterns at the Tzereta building site where the aqueduct ends to the S. It is thought likely that this water system supplied the E side of the town, where the major network of buildings was located, as opposed to the agora. The aqueduct is now documented over a distance of some 380m up to the SW of the intersection of the roads to Speliani and Eupalinos and was destroyed during the HL period. These discoveries will lead to a fundamental reconsideration of the town planning of anc. Samos. (ADelt 377-9) Museum and conservation. Cataloguing began in the Old Museum, Vathi, including the registration of all material from the Heraion excavations undertaken by the German Archaeological Institute. Conservation of mosaics was under- taken at two locations, five R examples at the Tsardoulia plot in the agora and those from the HL building complex at the gymnasium building site to the N. Damage incurred by the latter mosaics after their first conservation in 1983 was repaired and the floors were re-covered until a roof can be provided. (ADelt 375, 381) Heraion. H.J. Kienast reports on work by the DAI in 1996: "In the Heraion of Samos excavations on the Sacred Road were carried out with the aim of defining the E boundary of the sanctuary. The excavated area lies exclusively on the N side of the Sacred Road and comprises ten areas of 4 x 4m, oriented on the axis of the road (Fig. 89: excavation area from the NE). A large part of the newly excavated area contained a cemetery with rather poor burials; 16 of the 20 graves which were investigated contained bones of infants. What is interesting is that the cemetery is clearly related to the Sacred Road and apparently even respects the temenos boundary, although the burials can only have taken place in Byz times. Below the cemetery five imposing votive dedications came to light; unfortunately, only their foundations were found and there were few indications of the superstructures. Apart from a rectangular bathroom and two almost square foundations of usual form and dimensions, two monuments are noteworthy: one of about 6m length, of which three base blocks were found as they had fallen, with the settings for bronze statues (two male and one female) and above all with the dedicatory inscriptions and, even more impressive, a H-shaped exedra, whose restored length is about 18m, on the E edge of the excavation area. All the monuments date from LHL times; more precise details cannot be given at present, since the stratigraphy was very disturbed. Of special importance, however, is the temenos wall, which was discovered immediately E of the previous excavation limit and lies, therefore, exactly where the area of the new excavation joins the old. The wall forms an acute angle with the Sacred Road, but bends ca 5m before the N edge of the road, so that it forms a right angle with it. The actual junction with the road has been robbed and since the wall foundation lies immediately above a levelled and tamped layer of gravel from the river Imbrasos, no robber trenches were found, which might have given information about the junction. Only a well, discovered immediately outside the wall line, adds to the picture. It looks as if the entrance had no gate nor any other special structure. Apart from the wall, which was of excellent quality, only this well marked the boundary between the profane and sacral areas (Fig. 90: entrance area: [top left] remains of the temenos wall; [bottom right] the well; [behind it] the foundations of a dedication). Because of extensive disturbances of the soil during Byz times, finds are rather sparse: apart from unimportant sherds, the A period only produced a small Egyptian faience, a broken part of a bronze Bes-figure and, more importantly, part of the drapery of a kore, at least life-size, whose style is analogous to the Cheramyes korai, but constitutes a new type (Fig. 91). Among later finds, the number of glass pieces is remarkable, as are plaster fragments of excellent quality, which point to consequential households of the R period. The finds leave no doubt that the excavated area lies outside the A sanctuary and that the temenos boundary remained in force in later times, although its exact course cannot be ascertained at the moment."</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 Fig. 79 Thera. Ch. Doumas reports on the work of the AS at Akrotiri in Ergon 1996 (75-7), with excavation having continued in Xeste 4, at the eastern, deepest recess of the large staircase. These revealed a stair-head of large schist slabs which had subsided due to the weight of earth upon it. Within the fill were pieces of the frescos which had decorated the walls of the landing. These depicted a procession of men ascending the stairs, as seen on other sections of the staircase. Some of the men were holding objects; however, these have yet to be identified. In the N wing of the great staircase (which led from the W landing to the landing of the first floor), the stone steps which had collapsed after the destruction of the building had to be removed in order to reveal many pieces of the fresco. In the area of Pessos 17 in the 'Square of the Cenotaph', the foundation trench of the N wall of synkrotema D was revealed. To the N of this was a layer of sand and pebbles covering the remains of a big fire, above which was found a small marble figurine of Troad type. From the work of previous years it is known that this area is connected with ceremonies which took place during the ECyc period (AR 1994-95, 57-58). Continued excavation will clarify this matter. The press reported the discovery of a LCh basilica, settle- ment and cemetery at Perissa. Restoration of the church of Agia Eirene revealed part of the basilica's N colonnade, its Corinthian capitals dating to the 5th or early 6th Ct AD. Spanning the 1st to 7th/8th Ct AD, the cemetery consisted of 160 pit and cist graves and two groups of vaulted chambers, the latter being large rubble-built structures containing a single cist grave for an individual burial. Considered characteristically Theran are four ECh grave slabs inscribed with the name 'Ayyekos and that of the dead (mostly in the genitive). Among numerous finds from the cemetery were well- preserved glass vessels, coins, bronze-work and some gold jewellery. The many lamps recovered indicate close links between Santorini and Corinth, Attica (Athens) and Asia Minor during the 3rd to 6th Cts AD. (Kathemerini 25.2.97) DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS Alimnia. In 1991 and 1992 D.J. Blackman had paid brief visits to the now uninhabited island of Alimnia off the coast of Rhodes at the request of I. Papachristodoulou, Ephor of the 22nd Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, in order to check the identification of remains discovered in 1980 during excavation of a N site on the island (AR 1988-89, 109). He was able to confirm the existence of 10 and 11 shipsheds in the bays of Ag. Georgios and Emporeio. Their remarkable feature is the apparent great width of the rock-cut slips-much greater than that of the standard trireme type-combined with short surviving length. They may have been 'double' shipsheds; however, so far no remains have been found of any internal divisions within the slips, cut in bedrock which is now very weathered, nor any evidence of roofing or hauling machinery. In view of the importance of the site, which seems to have been a naval base for guard-ships of HL Rhodes, underwater investigation is now planned in co-operation with the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, in order to complete the survey already carried out above the surface. A preliminary reconnaissance was carried out in avgust 1995 with A. Simossi of that Ephorate, with a view to a first season in 1997. Kos: city. In Chalbazia district (E of Odos Apellou) on the NE side of Serayia hill excavations produced in the SW area a complex of A rooms, very important for the pre-Synoikismos history of the island; overlying structures belong to LA and C phases, much damaged by a HL building. In the NE area a R building was found above building remains of the Myc and M period of the PR settlement on Serayia hill; one trench went down to an MB level-the earliest occupation period on this side of the hill. Above this were remains of an LMIA building, disturbed by a well filled with Myc sherds. In another trench remains of an LMIA destruction level were found. Finally, E of the A complex, a Myc level was found cut into by five PG burials. PR finds included a gold necklace with schematized lily-shaped beads and a pair of schematized bucranium-shaped earrings. In drain construction by the municipality were found: columns which may belong to the W stoa of the R phase of the anc. agora; an area of the central square of the agora; and walls of buildings behind long stoas of the agora. In the Tsoche plot test trenches under mosaic floors and the marble floor of a cistern revealed EHL buildings overlying rubbish from an amphora production workshop; on the edge of the plot were found architectural members probably from a large (public?) building. In the SE part of the anc. city (Koutouzi plot) remains were found of houses of succeeding HL phases, beneath which rock- cut cists contained pottery thrown out of pottery workshops in the late 4th and 3rd Ct BC. At one point what seems to be the bedding for the E fortification wall and paving of the inner circuit road were found. An area of the HL cemetery was destroyed in building work for the armed forces (Ampavri); on the N side of the road from Kos to Platani and the Asklepieion, a R underground vaulted tomb was found, with a peribolos and 99</page><page sequence="100">100 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 92 Fig. 93 three separately-roofed chambers and the bottom part of seven stelai in situ; it was in use from the lst/2nd to the late 3rd Ct AD. (A Delt 486-92) Excavations in Kos mod. town on Odos Gregoriou E' continue to reveal parts of an anc. road going N-S. The junction of two roads (one running E-W, the other N-S) was also found. The drain in the road was covered by stone slabs and marble architectural spolia. Adjacent building remains go down 4m until they meet bedrock. These include a room of an ECh house, another room of another structure with a LR mosaic floor depicting the Rape of Europa, remains of a bath house (hypocaust columns, floor of a caldarium), and part of a marble- lined cistern. Under this cistern, parts of a mosaic floor (or floors) were uncovered, one of which depicts a dolphin and includes the artist's signature NEIKH TOY rPATANTO[X]. Part of a monumental HL building NE of the site covered what appears to have been a C site, and was in turn replaced by an ECh structure. Work continues. Parts of a R workshop and storage area were uncovered on Odos Makrygianni (E. Oikonomidou plot). Remains come from two phases and include cisterns and a built pithos-shaped storage area. (ADelt 506-8) Kardamaina (anc. Alasarna). G. Alevra, S. Kalopise and M. Panagiotide report on the excavation of the Temple of Apollo in 1995-96: "The University of Athens excavation which has continued since 1985 on the Patera-Tsankaroule plot in Kardamaina (anc. Alasama) has discovered in the last two excavation seasons one more temple (9.30 x 16.49 m) of LC-EHL times. The building (r: Fig. 92) lies 22m N of the LHL temple A (Temple of Apollo?); the larger part of its 3-step krepidoma, the orthostats of the W side and a short section of the S long side, and part of the make-up of the floor are preserved. The interior is full of fallen architectural members of the superstructure (drums of the Doric columns of the pronaos, displaced threshold, etc.) which permit secure conclusions on its form and type: among them are also fragments of two inscriptions. In front of the E side and near the NW comer of the buildings the foundations of the bases of a total of five dedications have been discovered. Excavation continued also in the S part of the plot, to complete the discovery of ECh building remains whose excavation started in 1992. There are two complexes of houses with workshop areas (Fig. 93), E of the ECh tomb complex, with two construction phases." Rhodes: eastern defences. Odos Byronos and Kanada: the study of the HL fortification wall, circuit street P40, the monu- mental collecting drain and the remaining storerooms and workshops, was completed in the E area of the site. The wall was uncovered for ca 7m, running NW-SE and preserved to a height of 5 courses (ca 2.50m), the three lower courses being foundation courses. It was a solid construction ca 2.18m wide, with two buttresses on the inner side, ca 5.40m apart, one preserved to four courses (cf. ADelt 23, 445). The foundations of this wall and of circuit street P40, the large drain to the S and the large pier bases to the N, cut into the remains of the earlier pottery workshops. Sherds of pottery rejects were found in the sandy fill of the foundation trench of the wall. Street P40 ran along the inside of the wall: its paving levels had in places (especially to the S) been cut into by buildings of late antiquity, such as walls, and an ECh rectangular built well. The street was ca 13.80m wide and to the S was defined by the open, monumental drain, much of which was discovered in 1988-90. The drain is ca 2.15m deep and ca 2.80m wide. Its walls, like the fortification wall alongside, run under Odos Kanada. Just outside the wall, under the LR structures, a line of four pier bases was found, probably from roofed storerooms. N of the wall and E of the piers were found much damaged remains of rooms of a pottery workshop of at least two building phases with traces of a kiln and two shallow open semicircular drains, their inner walls lined with hydraulic cement, probably linked to a cistern; fragments of clay tiles and coarse sherds, a floor covered with sherds of large unpainted pots and below it an earlier floor with pieces of unbaked clay. These fragmentary remains, of more than one phase, seem to belong to a pottery workshop predating the HL fortification wall and storerooms; they continue to E, N and S and must be connected to similar remains to the NE found in 1989 (A Delt 44,473-4) S of the fortification wall were found the bases for wooden (?) columns supporting roofing over a workshop area, and remains associated with a pottery kiln. N of the wall structures were identified, probably belonging to an early phase of the workshop. The construction of a new fortification wall after the siege by Demetrios Poliorketes involved also construction of a major flood drain, and (in an area near Akandia harbour) of storerooms; the pottery workshop therefore had to be moved to a nearby site, where it continued in production. Overlying</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 levels of fill contained, inter alia, 3rd- to 1st-Ct BC pottery and remains of kilns and pottery activity. Six rooms were discovered with heaped human bones and LR lamps; the bones must have come from a nearby necropolis, not yet identified. All these remains have been preserved in the basement of a new building, during deep excavation for the foundations of which remains were found with pottery similar to that found in 1988-90 (ADelt 43, 593; 44,474), and datable to the MBA. Together with the LA finds from the same plot they are the only finds excavated in the area of the city of Rhodes which pre-date the synoikismos. (A Delt, 445-9) City: N sector. On Eleftheria Square (Mandraki) remains were found of structures belonging to a rearrangement of the little (military) harbour in late antiquity. Excavation of a moder drain S of the Town Hall revealed remains of a net of streets and drains: P2[, P3 (E-W) and P39a (N-S) and the corer of P3a/P39. (A Delt 449-50) City: W sector (anc. acropolis). During work by the municipality at the W end of Odos Diagoridon in the area of the acropolis monuments, a section of the monumental wall built under the Italians on the S side of the road was found. The S limit of the area excavated is ca 180m from the S wall of the acropolis gymnasion excavated by I. Kondis. At the N edge of the area were found the monumental N and E walls with beam slots of a vaulted room, connected with water supply, which was much reduced in size in a later (LR) phase. Below the floor was found a rectangular built well and lead water channel which continued as a clay pipe. An inscribed shield of Lartios stone was found linking the find site with the gymnasion and the stadion: its letter forms indicate a 2nd Ct BC date. Ancient road P15 which runs under Odos Diagoridon was not found in this excavation, as had been expected: its W end must lie to the E. (ADelt 450-2) At Odos Cheimarras and Enoplon Dynameon excavation of an insula in the anc. city grid continued (see AR 1995-96, 39). The E side of N-S street P26 was found, which forms the W side of the insula, which at this point was open to the sky. Excavation of rooms of the HL house in the insula continued, including one with a mosaic floor, and of the cistern of a LR bath establishment in the S part of the insula. In the SE corner of the insula formed by streets P27, P5a, P27p and P5 excavations revealed remains of 4 building phases which showed a change in use of the area from workshop in the HL period to habitation in the R period. The HL workshop (phase I) was used for casting bronze statues and is located in an area on the W side of the anc. city at the foot of the acropolis where extensive remains of similar workshops had already been found close to the anc. temples (and confirming the tradition of Rhodian bronze casting). Of phase II (R period) too little was found to identify the use of the building. In phase III the area was occupied by a secular building which went through two building phases, with a mosaic floor in a room of phase III. A terminus post quem for the alterations of phase III is provided by a 5th Ct lamp and sherds of Late Roman C ware (late 5th/early 6th Ct). The alterations were not completed and the building was finally abandoned in the 1 st half of the 6th Ct. The termination of repair of the building is probably to be connected with the earthquake attested in AD 515. (Pindou 30 &amp; Sophouli: A Delt 454-7) Plateia Navarinou: Remains of an anc. casting pit found under the two occupation levels identified (A Delt 457-9). Odos Pavlidi: excavation of N side of E-W street P17 completed; street was uncovered for a length of 17.2m and served as a terrace wall for the higher ground to the S. The wall had buttresses on both sides; walls to the N of it are later, but still HL, and must be connected to an important building. To the E two founding furnaces of brick are HL. (A Delt 459-61) City: E sector. Various rescue excavations were carried out; one located a 16m stretch of N-S street P32[, 5.20m wide, its drain, and a room of a house to the W with Rhodian amphoras stacked on their sides. On Odos Byronos a stretch of the drain of circuit road P40 was found, but not the HL fortifications as expected (perhaps because the blocks had been robbed and the wall had been built on the bedrock but not cut into it); also part of the drain of street P15, with walls added inside perhaps to restrain the water flow. The junction of this E-W drain with the main drain S of P40 was not found; nor were the walls or paving of street P15. Remains of various HL buildings were found S of P15, including remains of pottery workshops. (A Delt 461-5) W Cemetery. A large section was found on Monte Smith (area of the anc. acropolis) used over many centuries: HL, R and ECh (3rd Ct BC to 5th Ct AD); a R tomb seems to have a burial of siamese twins (Parodos Esiodou). Rescue excavations revealed many other tombs of this HL-R cemetery. Noteworthy were the tombs and tomb complexes at, and W of, the junction Sophouli and Parthenopis, just S of the HL fortifications, and a N extension of the open archaeological site preserving part of the cemetery; two R tombs had overlying buildings, one with a mosaic floor (the first found in this cemetery). Many coffins and several sarcophagi were inscribed, and one tomb had traces of wall painting with geometric and plant decoration (1st Ct BC-AD). Stretches were found of the road through the cemetery, but without dating evidence. In one complex were found many inscribed stelai, cylindrical altars (some inscribed) and part of a LHL statue of ephebic type. At the S end of the cemetery a burial area with two clear phases (3rd and 2nd-lst Cts BC) was investigated; the later phase had two periboloi (Odos Embonas). Study was completed in 1991 of a monumental tomb complex (1st Ct BC-AD: Koundouri plot) investigated since 1989, with six vaulted ChTs off a central court and a tomb in the form of a prostyle distyle naiskos; the complex was surrounded by a peristyle, and its three phases cover the mid 2nd Ct to the late 1st Ct BC/early 1st Ct AD. (A Delt 465-77) S Cemetery: Rodini. Work continued on two sites in the long narrow cemetery along the Rhodos-Lindos road. (A Delt 477) E Cemetery: Phaneromeni. Work was completed on a tomb complex studied in 1989 (Karamanoli-Pogia plot) with an impressive peribolos wall and stepped terraces descending to the E. (A Delt 477-9) Rhodes town. Once again, extensive coverage is given in the ADelt 46 of the restoration work undertaken by the 4th Ephorate, the Ministry of Culture, the Archaeological Receipts Fund (TAPA) and the Municipality of Rhodes on the conserva- tion and restoration of the Med and Ott monuments of Rhodes town. Excavations inside the church of Agios Artemios in the med town revealed eight building phases covering a depth of 1.5m, the earlier phases dating to the period of the Knights. Levels 7 and 8 had burials and secondary depositions of human remains. Deeper excavation in the middle of the nave uncovered R spolia, one with a votive inscription in Greek. Total finds included 244 corroded coins, 417 choice finds and 313 sacks of sherds, glass fragments and bronze small finds. Finds associated with the burials include bronze pins and fibulae, small bronze crosses, the blade of a metal knife, an iron key, 101</page><page sequence="102">102 DAVID BLACKMAN traces of woven fabric with gold thread, and other similar objects. (ADelt 496-7) Investigations of the Byz Kollakio city wall continued on Odos Panaitiou near the Siileyman mosque. One section located part of the Byz outer wall, packed with LR pottery and some coins, the latest being of Constans II (d. 668). The fill covering the face of the S wall was mostly of the Crusader and Ott periods. Investigations continue. (ADelt 497-9) Investigations of the church of Agioi Konstantinos &amp; Elene (E. Kollias, The City of Rhodes, Athens 1988, 79) revealed evidence for the original med structure and the changes under- taken by the Turks after the building was converted into a mosque. Thirty-nine Crusader period burials were found in the narthex, oriented to the E. One skeleton, indeed, had a coin of the Knights between its teeth. Finds include: fragments of vessels and candle holders-lamps, anc. spolia, nails from coffins, fragments of bronze chains, bronze links from necklaces or fabric decoration, pins, fibulae, thimbles, etc. A small poros stone head was also found, imitating an archaic kore. It had been used to decorate a window frame. (ADelt pl.177a). Part of a Crusader-style wall-painting of the Virgin was also found. The building phases have not yet been clearly established. (ADelt 499-502) Reports continue on the many excavations and investigations concerning the city walls of Rhodes town. Inscribed Byz pottery associated with fill and burials found along one side of the wall on Odos Agesandrou provide a 12th Ct date for this section of the wall. Burial finds included a large iron liturgical cross. (ADelt 502) Apreviously unknown basilica (1050 x 4.70m) with floor mosaic was discovered at the Panagia sto Gremo site, 2km from the settlement of Agios Isidoros, and the bema area was investigated. Much destroyed due to farming, the mosaic has a simple design of parallel squares and foliate motifs. Also, an ECh wall-painting fragment of an unidentified scene was discovered (no further details given). No sign of settlement during the ECh period has so far been found in the vicinity. (ADelt 505) House and pottery remains of an ECh settlement came to light at Agrolakkos near the ECh basilica discovered during previous excavations. An interesting find was an stamped amphora handle with the inscription: EnI IEPEZQX T/IMOAIKOY MH/NOXZ MINOIOY. (ADelt 504) lalysos. Excavations continued at Trianta and in the wider area of Ialysia. Another LMIA site was found at Trianta; MBA sherds were found nearby. Important finds were made in con- tinuing excavations on the E edge of the M and Myc settlement. (A Delt 479-80) Excavation continued of the EB settlement at Asomato Kremastis, and confirmed the importance of the site. More of the NW megaron-shaped building was uncovered (11.70 x 7.65m, oriented ESE-WNW) with a round stone hearth (diam. 1.50-1.60m) roughly in the centre of the S hall, with its clay surface showing signs of fire. The bases of its walls were of stone faced with clay, and the upper parts of clay. A destruction layer was found at floor level, containing much broken pottery, mainly amphoras and phialai. The N side of the building was divided into three rooms, one with a door (the only one found so far). Two other buildings have also been identified. (A Delt 480) Lindos. Major restoration work was carried out on the HL stoa and propylaea. (A Delt 492-4) Paradeisi. Again (as in previous excavation to the SE) a layer of tephra was found, 20cm thick. (ADelt 485) Theologos. Temple of Erethymian Apollo. Excavation con- tinued (by the 22nd Ephorate and the University of Ioannina) within the temple. The main find was the discovery deeper than the lowest point of the foundations of two small rectangular built graves, one still containing remains of a skeleton. Lack of grave goods makes dating difficult, but they are certainly ear- lier than the temple, probably G or A in date; future excavations may solve the problems they raise about the earlier use of this area. On a nearby site (Potsou plot) remains of a rectangular structure were further investigated, probably intended to receive the remains of sacrifices; remains were also found of mosaic pavements; of the font of an ECh baptistery; and of a potter's workshop. (A Delt 485-6) Trianta. Close to the area where tephra had already been found, associated with a small amount of LMIA pottery, further structures were excavated and LMIA pottery and a small amount of tephra (Odos Perdikaki). This confirmed the impression of the situation outside the LBA/LMIA settlement at Trianta during the interval between the earthquake and the eruption of the volcano of Thera. At a site S of the ECh basilica and just E of the M and Myc settlement, excavation produced PR, A and ECh remains (Odos Dorieos): LBA pithos burials and cist graves and simple burials in contracted position were associated with early LMIA pottery. Some LMIA walls were found, outside the settlement area, which the excavator thinks may have been on the BA shoreline and possibly docks associated with the half-completed building phases preceding the volcanic eruption. Some burials without grave goods could date from immediately after the earthquake. The first LA finds in the Trianta plain were made: a round built cist with A pottery (olpai and kylikes) and nearby pottery laid upside down in layers in a semi-circular formation, probably for a local chthonic cult of Ialysos (2nd half of the 6th Ct BC). Work was also completed on the outer rooms of the ECh basilica. (ADelt 481-5) Telendos. Evidence of a LR settlement has come to light on the Trikoile site in the form of wall remains, pottery and glass fragments, bronze cut-outs, and coins. The destruction of this site on the island is associated with the great earthquake of AD 551 which reduced much of neighbouring Kos as well. (ADelt 508-10) CENTRAL CRETE We are now approaching the centenary of the start of systematic excavations at Knossos (1900). In this context we at the BSA should particularly like to express our appreciation for the close collaboration we enjoy with the 23rd Ephorate. Like her predecessors, the Ephor, Alexandra Karetsou, and all her colleagues have given great practical support to the School's projects as well as facilitating study in the Heraklion and Stratigraphical Museums. Plans for an extension to Heraklion Museum on land formally owned by the Kalokairinos Foundation are progressing well and the excavation of the area has revealed important remains of many periods; these will be reported in the future. A great deal of work is being carried out at Knossos in con- nection with the conservation of the site and its presentation to</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 103 Fig. 95 Fig. 94 the visitor. All these efforts bode well for the future and should be supported by all. The BSA has made an effort to contribute to the conservation of the sites in the valley in several ways, always seeking advice from the 23rd Ephorate. The account of the initial conservation of the Antonine Roman 'Villa Dionysos' contained in this report is but one of three major on-going projects. Conservation and presentation of both the Stratigraphical Museum excavations of Prof. P.M. Warren (AR 1981-82, 1982-83, 1984-85) and the Edwardian garden of Sir Arthur Evans are in hand, with a view to completion by 2000, the centenary of Evans's excavations. Apart from publications mentioned in the reports, the most important of 1997 might be singled out as the Knossos North Cemetery. Early Greek Tombs. Vols. 1-4. J.N. Coldstream and H.W. Catling eds. (1997) and Late Minoan III Pottery. Chronology and Terminology. Acts of a Meeting held at the Danish Institute at Athens. avgust 12-14, 1994, E. Hallager and B.P. Hallager eds. Athens (1997). A large number of building projects in 1991 (ADelt 46) produced a huge number of rescue excavations for the 23rd Ephorate, of which the following is a brief account. Agia Triada. Vincenzo La Rosa (Italian School) writes that the 1996 excavation took place E of the large stoa of the so-called agora. Two sets of trenches were opened of which the first (A- H) revealed very few structures, the only notable one being in sector M/1 where a wall, 4.20m in length and an impressive 1.65m in width, was found (Fig. 94). Constructed of large blocks, some trapezoidal, all appear to be re-used in the wall which dates to LM IIIA:1-2. The second set of trenches (I-N) uncovered G remains, the first evidence of this period to be found at the site. LM I levels, behind the so-called Bastione, may indicate cuttings for a pathway. All this has given important evidence for the extent of settlement in the neopalatial and postpalatial periods. Chersonesos. At the Philippakis plot excavations were carried out on a HL cemetery. (ADelt 396-402) Sanoudakis Street: At the Aspetakis plot located N of the theatre of Chersonesos there was an investigation in the area of the likely anc. agora. In the N part of the plot a strong solid wall was discovered running W-E. It was preserved to a length of 20.50m and continued close to the unexcavated house. Two phases of the house could be distinguished, the older dating to the HL period. The walls of this phase were constructed from unworked stones and potsherds, bound together with organic material. The second phase, R in date, was constructed from square blocks, small stones and crushed pottery bound together with mortar. On the N side of the wall at intervals of ca im, five rectangular constructions made from unworked stones, pebbles, fragments of tiles and a great deal of lime were added, probably as buttresses. (ADelt P1. 1565: Fig. 95) In the S part of the plot a R street was found running for 37.50m SW to NE. It was 2.40m wide and extended outside of the E and W borders of the plot. The exterior construction was of poros stone with small stones fitted into the joints bound together with lime and the interior was made from unworked stone, tile and mortar. (ADelt 402 &amp; P1. 156g: Fig. 96) Gortyn. Agioi Deka. There was a small excavation in 1990-91 in the Kalathianakis plot W of the road to Vagionia. The plot is located in the area of the R cemetery of anc. Gortyn. The excavation brought to light nine burials, shaft-graves, tile graves and one sarcophagus. There was a single burial in each grave except for one of the graves, which was a collective burial. None of the graves had skeletons preserved in a good state. The majority of the graves seem to have been robbed, because of the displaced and broken tile coverings, scattered bone, crushed bone, and the general disturbance. In all of the area which was excavated isolated fragments of bone were found (principally femurs), scattered bone and all the pieces of a broken statue. From the graves the principal finds were perfume boxes, pottery (including spindle-whorls) and glass ware; also 2 wine jugs, 2 cups, 2 amphoras with low feet, and 9 coins. One shaft grave, 1.10m long, had a covering of square tiles. The orientation of the grave was from W to E, and inside were small parts of decayed bone. The grave contained the following grave goods: a pair of intact gold earrings decorated in the shape of lion heads, the type being of HL origin, dated to the end 1st Ct AD/ beginning 2nd Ct AD. There was also a buckle which was made from gold-plated wire with vegetal decoration; a gold-leaf ring with a cornelian inset; a silver garland with gold leaf over the core in the form of a vine scroll. Based on the date of the jewellery, the burial has been dated to the st or 2nd Ct AD. There was a single skeleton in a buried sarcophagus, laid in a mausoleum oriented NS which measured 2.10 x 3.35m; four</page><page sequence="104">104 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 97 Fig. 96 steps led down into the mausoleum from the S (ADelt P1. 157g: Fig. 97). The grave must have been damaged in antiquity, given that the roof and the entrance were destroyed. Above the level of the grave there was a layer of material from the collapsed walls and the roof. This layer contained animal bone, a buried dog, R and recent bones, and coins of the Cretan State dating from 1900. Most of the surviving grave goods were found on the floor; these included lamps, 14 perfume bottles, blue glass scarabs, and a small round silver box with a lid, one dagger with an iron blade and silver surround with inserted decoration, one bronze chain, two bronze pins, two oinochai and two spherical pots characteristic of the 1 st Ct AD. The grave construction, lamps and other finds would all confirm a 1st Ct AD date. (ADelt 403-404) Anc. agora. Antonio Di Vita reports: "Excavations by the Italian School in 1996 in collaboration with the 23rd Ephorate were carried out in an attempt to investigate Halbherr's excavations of 1900. This area was located to the S of the odeion, and an attempt was made to fill in the blanks in Halbherr's daybook, in order to deepen the study of the area. Various trenches opened in the area included one (A) to the S at the end of the post-scaenam wall of the odeion (wall I) and another (B) to the S in order to investigate a wall (wall II), which had been identified by Pernier as the stylobate of the porticus post scaenam of the odeion. Wall III was located to the S of this area (Trenches C-D; Fig. 98: general view of the odeion from the SW; in the foreground trenches C [with the drain], D and B). Trenches were also opened in order to investigate Halbherr's Fig. 98 and Perier's Rectangular Building, which is older than the odeion. Finally a trench was opened to investigate the so-called W stoa, on the E bank of the river Metropolianos. As a result of the investigation the construction of walls I-III was dated to the first half of the 2nd Ct BC, and their demolition to the LR/EByz period. Moreover, in the excavator's view, the earlier rectangular building contained the great inscription in a semi-circular exedra, which was at the rear of an open space exactly to the W, and accessible when one went up the two steps which are preserved below the floor of Trajan's odeion. Although there was only a small part of the street exposed, a street probably ran between walls I and II, which was constructed from pebbles and beaten earth. It is suggested that wall I was built in order to enclose the upper part of the agora from the S and wall II was the back wall of the N stoa. There was also a drain of fine opus quadratum 0.56 x 1 x 3.20m (surviving length), close to wall III. Through the opening of another trench (C) an area was discovered which provided some good chronological evidence. There was a floor of beaten earth which was dated to the 2nd Ct BC, like walls I-III, and well above it a floor with marble flags, the latter seemingly dating to the Trajanic/Hadrianic period, after the destruction datable to the Trajanic period, or after a later destruction, which has been dated by coins to the</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 105 Fig. 99 end of the 3rd Ct AD. There is evidence of a period of re-use in the 7th Ct, which is marked by finds of domestic ware. In the N part of the excavation there were the remains of three EByz burials located above the porticus post scaenam. The above results concur with what Halbherr had said about the area, that a Byz settlement was built about the agora, with burials nearby (Fig. 99: Byz decorated jug from trench C). There was also similar evidence in the Praetorium after the destruction caused by the 670 AD earthquake. The investigations of the W stoa area showed that the remains overlying a HL level were likely to date to the 2nd/3rd Ct AD and that there were several phases: it was only in a later phase that the room became a stoa, open to the W and linked on the S to the later porticus post scaenam of the odeion. The Praetorium. The investigation of street 43 was continued with a further 8m or more of the LR paving revealed (Fig. 100: the street, from the N). At the same time there was an investigation of the building with the large square blocks which lined the street on the E and which, like the street, showed evidence of being damaged by the AD 618 earthquake. Also it was clarified that the late 7th Ct AD monastery was built on top of the Praetorium of Heraclius and that it went out of use in the 8th Ct AD. Mitropolis. The Italian School and the Byzantine Ephorate (M. Borboudaki) continued work on the basilica at Mitropolis. The excavation concentrated on the area W of the inner narthex. They found that the first basilica (under Justinian) and the second (7th Ct) had had a single entrance stoa; if it was, as usual, square it made the basilica one of the biggest in Crete. There were also excavations around and in the supposed baptistery; subsequently graves were built in the area and destroyed the N half of it. In the area N of the basilica a large circular ruin was brought to light. We excavated down 2m into the building from the surface, where we discovered a series of apses in the interior. The circular building was richly decorated as is shown by the marble mosaic floors which were discovered. This building is likely to have been a mausoleum of late antiquity rather than a nymphaeum or a fountain. The excavation, however, did not go far enough to prove the theory presented." Herakleion. The fifth season of work in 1991 on the wreck of the 17th-Ct French warship 'La Therese' is described in Deltion 526-8. Kato Syme Biannou. Excavations continued at the Shrine of Hermes and Aphrodite in 1993. The work was concentrated in the NE of the site on the house shrine dating to the HL and R period. In the centre of the area there was a PG and G altar, and to the NW a half-ruined wall of the neopalatial building. The wall was built on top of two foundation walls of the old palace period. Underneath the lowest courses of building C-D were found 100 votives that came from a disturbed layer dating from the 1st millenium. In the middle of one of the layers there were coins of the 1st Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD; there were also fragments of pottery dating from the HL and the early A period. The majority of the votives found were small fragments of iron items, but there were also eight G bronze bull figurines, the head of a male figurine and also a richly decorated bronze horse trapping of the 7th Ct BC. (PAE 1993, 209-30) Knossos. According to press reports there were excavations in the area of the Venizelos Hospital. Graves dating from the M to the PG period were investigated. There were also R pit and cist graves and one marble sarcophagus discovered in the area. A large built grave with a vaulted roof produced grave goods such as gold jewellery and a silver pyxis decorated in relief with animals. From the HL period there was a small shrine dedicated to the god Demeter. (Adesmeftos Tipos 9/5/96). Three tests and three rescue excavations were carried out in 1991 on building plots and agricultural land. Investigation of the site under the new University of Crete (Ambelokipi) at the north end of the Knossos valley was continued with an excavation of some 1,500m2 in a NE area designated for a student refectory. Essentially, the site is that now known as the North Cemetery (Stratigraphical Museum nomenclature = KMF) excavated by the British School in collaboration with the Ephorate between 1967 and 1979 and now published by the School (Knossos North Cemetery. Early Greek Tombs. Vols.1-4. J.N. Coldstream and H.W. Catling eds., 1997). In 1991, 118 new tombs were excavated. They were chiefly long rectangular pit graves (average dimensions 1.80 x 0.50 m) but also three cist graves, three built tombs of 'mausoleum' type, four large rectangular pit graves, three of which had stone linings, and 20 tile-graves in surface levels. The pit graves are mostly HL and R containing a single burial usually with only lamps and 'tear bottles'. Some HL tombs occasionally had interesting finds such as a gold ring with an erotic scene (T34- 4th Ct BC), a gold, double-sided rosette (T32-2nd Ct BC), a Fig. 100</page><page sequence="106">106 DAVID BLACKMAN I 0 5m I_=Mll~ VILLA DIONYSOS, KNOSSOS Fig. 101 small clay Dionysiac mask (1st Ct BC) as well as bronze and glass objects. A Minoan sealstone showing a ship and two women found above T45 is of interest. (ADelt Fig. 1, p.392) The three built tombs are R (1st Ct AD), one of which (T23: 2.75 x 2.23m) had compartments on the S covered by tiles. T6, of the same type, had an elliptical pit in the middle with tiles and sherds and burials on the SW belonging to women and children with a few grave goods of bronze, bone and clay. Both T6 and T23 had inclined sides which may indicate earthquake damage, so common in Crete. The finds-clay and glass vases, clay masks and especially the coins-show that these tombs were in use between the 1st and 2nd Ct AD. The other built tomb (T7) is 5th-Ct AD. Three LM III-EPG ChTs on the SE had been disturbed by later pit-graves. T95 contained eight LM III-SM vases (ADelt Pl.153g) while T113 contained EPG burials. T96 was of interest in that it had five chambers with burials from SM to EPG. At the G. Vlachakis plot in Bougada Metochi, four trial trenches were opened revealing an extensive R water system lined with plaster and covered with clay slabs. Walls running N-S and E-W came to light in trench F. Apart from terra sigillatta etc., 17 domestic vessels were found, one of which contained fruit. Other finds included tesserae, fragments of glass, loomweights, lead and seven badly preserved bronze coins, the best of which, of the Koine of Crete, belonged to the Hadrianic period. An architectural relief of Herakles was also found (14.50 x 0.22m). In Makryteichos, on the Emm. Akoumianakis plot, part of a large LM wall (orientated SW-NE) was found upon a fill of MM-LM. The N part was damaged by later simple tombs- undated. The plot of Milt. Skoulas on Odos Nathena revealed a semi- destroyed R built cist grave as well as two R tile graves; clay braziers, iron fibulae and bronze coins accompanied the latter. N of the University, on the Apost. Boboris plot, seven R tile graves with very few grave goods were found. On Monastiriaki Kefala, a field (of G. Sevastakis) produced a built cist grave with a tear-bottle and juglet; nearby to the NW were R to ECh sherds. (ADelt 391-3) Sara Paton reports on recent work on the Villa Dionysos: "A four-week campaign of preparatory work on the Villa Dionysos took place in April. The aims were to demolish the shelters built in 1935 over rooms N1, N2 and S1, since their roofs were decaying and broken tiles were falling onto the mosaics; to uncover all the floors in order to assess their condition and the measures needed for full conservation; to apply emergency conservation to the mosaics and re-cover them with modem protective materials; and to take new photographs of the site and the mosaics, suitable for use in fund-raising (Fig. 101: plan). Demolition of the old shelters started with room S1 (ca. 3.1m2). This mosaic has a shield design filled with radiating triangles and set in a guilloche square (the central motif, a head of Medusa, was destroyed by treasure-hunters early in this century); heads of putti representing seasons fill the spandrels. A wooden protective platform was constructed 0.5m above the floor and covered with polythene sheeting. The tiles and rafters were removed, followed by the concrete beam which supported the roof on the northern side facing the peristyle. The modem brick walls on the southern and eastern sides of room S1 were reduced in height but left standing just above the level of the surrounding ground, for protection, and the wooden platform was then dismantled for re-use over the floors of the north wing. At this point it was discovered that the mosaic floor of room S1 had been lifted, presumably in the nineteen-thirties, and entirely re-laid in concrete. No record of this operation survives, and it is not even certain that the mosaic was put back exactly in its original position, since it seems to be rather oddly tucked into the SE corner of the room instead of being centrally placed. The big shelter (ca 13 x 8m) over the northern rooms was then demolished by the same procedure, in two parts starting with the eastern end over room N2. The concrete beams which supported the roof on the southern side were too long and heavy to be allowed to fall without endangering the peristyle colonnade. The easternmost beam was therefore broken up by drilling and removed in pieces, but the remaining two, on the south side of room N1, were left in place, for fear that vibration from the drill might harm the fragile mosaic in this room. The northern and western walls of the shelter were then reduced in height and tidied up, the lower parts again being left a little above the surrounding ground level as protection. In room N2 (ca 6 x 3.2m) the main panel of the floor is square, with a portrait bust of Dionysos in the central medallion surrounded by seasonal birds and plants. To north and south there are rec- tangular panels with hunting scenes, and the northern part of the room has a pelta design in black-and-white. The tessellatum appears to have been superficially consolidated, again probably in the 'thirties, by the application of a skim of concrete; below this surface, however, the bedding is in a vulnerable state, and much of the northern part has collapsed due to subsidence. The mosaic in room N1 (ca 6.5 x 6m) depicts the companions of Dionysos in seven hexagonal panels set in a circle within a rectangle (one hexagon was destroyed in antiquity by a squatters' fire); birds and fish flank the circle on the eastern and western sides. This floor had suffered serious damage during the course of last winter. The great tree-root scar across the western part of the main panel had expanded, obliterating the urn between the two peacocks in the SW spandrel. Part of the meander border on this side had also broken up. Tiles had fallen</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 107 Fig. 102 from the roof onto the satyr in the NW hexagon and had knocked out his right eye; a break had developed in the portrait of another satyr in the SE hexagon, and the central hexagon with the flautist now has an ominous crack. Four of the six surviving busts-Pan, Silenus, the maenad and the flute- playing satyr-are still complete, but the bedding of this very fine mosaic is decayed and hollow in many places, and the entire floor is in a perilous condition (Fig. 102). While the shelters were being demolished the floors of the oecus and rooms S2, S3 and S4 were opened up. The protective covering placed over them in 1971 (consisting of sand under polythene sheeting, held in place by a layer of gravel) had done its job well considering that it was never intended to last for a quarter of a century, but in many places the polythene had begun to disintegrate. Roots, some of them very sturdy, were spreading underneath it, weeds were growing in the breaks and colonies of ants had established nests wherever possible, by exploiting the weak points in the tessellatum in order to burrow into the bedding below the surface of the floors. In the oecus (ca 9m2) the central panel of the mosaic was found to be almost intact (although the tesserae are discoloured by encrustation) and the bedding is more solid than in the northern rooms. The floor has a portrait bust of Dionysos, in the central roundel of an octagon set in a square, with heads of his companions in the eight surrounding segments and caryatids in the spandrels (Fig. 103 &amp; cover illustration). A series of elaborate borders fills the remainder of this large floor. The main areas of damage are in the borders. There is a long crack in the northern border, and parts of the western and southern borders are missing, perhaps where the upper slabs of marble veneer fell from the walls in the earthquake that wrecked the villa ca AD 200. These breaks had been edged in 1971 with harsh concrete, less flexible than the matrix of the mosaic, and the consequent stress had caused the tessellatum to break up on each side, allowing weeds and ants' nests to establish themselves in the resulting cracks. Broken edges in the floor of room S2 had also been mended with concrete, but with less serious result, since only the border of the mosaic survives. Cleaning in this part of the site revealed that S2 (ca 3.5m2) and S4 (ca 1.5 x 3.5m) had originally been built as a single rectangular room, probably a cubiculum, later divided into two unequal parts by the construction of an E-W partition. This consisted of two stone piers on either side of a doorway, flanked by pilasters of some less durable material, perhaps wood, faced with fluted pink-and-white stucco. Fig. 103 Fig. 104 The little doormat mosaic in the doorway between rooms S2 and S3 had survived intact, and the floor of room S3 (ca 3.7 x 7.3m) was found to be in fairly good condition, though discoloured by encrustation on the surface of the tesserae (Fig. 104). In the NW comer of the room the robbing-out of the wall had left the edge of the mosaic vulnerable to the usual weeds and ants' nests, and this section of the ivy-scroll border was rather unstable. The floor of S3 is mainly geometric, with a major eastern rectangle containing a square filled with concentric</page><page sequence="108">108 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 105 circles flanked by two rectangular panels of perspective solids, and a minor western panel filled with reticulate pattern in black-and-white. The only area of irrevocable damage in S3 (noted when the floor was excavated in 1958) is the gash in the central panel of the main rectangle, in which a bird is shown drinking from a tripod bowl; the harm was probably caused by some small heavy object, perhaps a metal lamp, falling onto it when the house was hit by earthquake. All members of the team took part in first-aid conservation of the floors, under the guidance of S. Chlouveraki. They worked for long hours in difficult conditions, often under temporary shelters rigged up against bad weather-rain, hail, sleet, even on one occasion snow. The damage to each mosaic was recorded on plan; superficial dirt was removed; the lacunae were cleaned; the old hard concrete repairs replaced by a more flexible (and removable) mortar; fragile glass tesserae were consolidated; loose tesserae were recorded on the plans and collected in numbered trays and bags; unstable areas of the tessellatum were faced with gauze fixed in place by soluble adhesive; the roots of all plants and weeds were injected with weedkiller, and disintegrating edges were secured with a mortar designed to match as closely as possible the composition of the original bedding. All these operations were recorded in photographs and on video (courtesy of Dr C.F. MacDonald). Work during the first week was also recorded for a BBC World Service Heritage programme on Knossos. Detailed and useful discussion of procedures for future full conservation of the villa were held during a visit by Professor D. Chryssopoulos, Dr A. Costanzi Cobau, Professor D. Michaelides and Dr R. Nardi. With the Ephor, Dr A. Karetsou, they inspected the site and approved the methods employed for temporary conservation. They also gave advice on many practical matters: for example, on the proper protective covering to be applied when this stage of the work is completed, the amount of work entailed in full restoration of the floors, and the measures (such as thorough drainage) needed for protection of the site so that final conservation, when complete, will be as durable as possible with the minimum of upkeep. Photography of large mosaic floors is always a problem, inthis case exacerbated by erratic weather. Composite photo- graphs, taken section by section and later joined up, had to be ruled out, since a unified result could not be achieved in such extreme and frequent variations of light. In the end a large crane was brought in and stationed on the hillside just above Fig. 106 the villa on the W side and the site was photographed by I. Papadakis, suspended in a metal cage about 35m above floor level (Fig. 105). Detailed photographs of the main motifs in the mosaics were also taken on colour slides. The crane was then put to use to re-erect the broken pink marble column in the entrance to the oecus and its Corinthian capital of Proconnesian marble, under the supervision of M. Zombanakis of the Heraklion Museum. This pink marble, Porta Santa from the imperial quarries on Chios, was valuable and is not commonly found outside Rome; the missing column of the pair probably fell without breaking when the villa was struck by earthquake and may have been removed at the time for use elsewhere. The restored column, which is more than 4m high, now gives imposing vertical scale to the room and emphasizes its monumental character (Fig. 106). The final stage in this year's work on the Villa Dionysos consisted of covering all the mosaic floors with modern protective material: first geotextile, then a layer of pumice, then a second layer of geotextile followed by a topmost layer of gravel. Some minor work of consolidation still needs to be done before next winter, on a few unstable stretches of wall, on the remaining fragments of marble veneer and on the heavy wall plaster which held the veneer in place in the oecus and room S3. The mosaics, however, should now be safe for the next year or two, until new shelters can be built over the rooms and the floors can be progressively re-opened for full-scale conservation." Kommos. Joseph and Maria Shaw (ASCS) report on the 1996 season: "The recent study season was devoted to eliminating backlogs and continued examination of the phases of large civic buildings characterising the S part of the Kommos site. In particular, J. Rutter is preparing a diachronic survey of the local and imported ceramics; M. Shaw is studying construction and painted plasters; J. Shaw is studying the architecture and miscellaneous small finds. These studies will emerge as chapters, still to be written, in Volume V in the Kommos publication series. We hope that most of the material will be ready by the fall of 1997. During the past year two major Kommos publications have appeared, the first and second parts of Volume I, The Kommos Region and Houses of the Minoan Town (Princeton University</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 109 Press): part 1, The Kommos Region, Ecology and Minoan Industries; and part 2, The Hilltop and Hillside Houses. The archaeological descriptions and interpretations in Part 2 are closely referenced to Part 1, but especially to Volume II on the Middle Minoan pottery (P. Betancourt, 1990) and Volume III on the Late Bronze Age Pottery (L.V. Watrous, 1992). Together the four volumes constitute a full-spectrum and an inter- disciplinary approach to interpretation. There are also ancillary articles that should he mentioned here, for instance a study (J. Shaw) which suggests (through an examination of nannofossils) that the two large LM IIIA1 stone anchors from the site are originally from the Ugarit area in Syria (International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 24 [1995] 279-291). Another study (J. Shaw, A. Van de Moortel, P. Day and V. Kilikoglou) which will appear shortly in Aegaeum concerns the LM IA pottery kiln in the S stoa of building T, found with its uniquely preserved evidence of wasters and kiln pottery. Volume IV on the Greek Sanctuary at Kommos is nearing completion in manuscript form. M. Shaw is presently revising her chapter on the Greek figurines. When published (perhaps in 1998), the volume should be the most complete study to-date of the architecture, stratigraphy and finds of a Cretan sanctuary. In progress is a study by Alan Johnston on the pottery and stratigraphy from building Z, which will add to our under- standing of domestic activities and international connections during that period. Further to activities in the early Greek Sanctuary, J. Shaw has submitted an article about the Phoenician role in temple B, to the acta of the recent congress in Cadiz, 'The Phoenicians in the Mediterranean'; a translation of this will appear in German in the Hamburger Beitrige. Toward the end of the season, J. and M. Shaw participated in a local symposium organized by Antonis Vasilakis and the town of Mires on the M history of the W Mesara. They were also made honorary citizens of the Pitsidia community. At the Eighth Cretological Congress M. Shaw spoke on the Knossian 'Priest King' fresco and J. Shaw on 'Pilgrims at the Greek Sanctuary at Kommos' and J. Rutter on the LM III A2/B short- necked amphoras from Kommos. These characterize the floor pottery within and outside of the P galleries, which may have been used as shipsheds. So far these amphoras remain unique to Kommos, probably being of local production, and we are anxious to find them in other contexts, perhaps abroad, as trade items. Rutter is also pursuing studies, including neutron activation work, with A. Hoffmann of the University of Manchester, of the Myc and many Cypriot ceramic imports from the site. Last summer we gave special attention to the conservation of the site. As a result, there was little damage during the torrential winter rains. Following up this initiative, we are considering, with the advice of the Ephor, Mrs. Alexandra Karetsou, as well as of the local Pitsidia/Matala community, the means to retain the rural character of the Kommos area as an archaeological park with its magnificent, clean shoreline to which thousands of vacationers flock each summer. However, the pressure for building shoreside hotels and houses remains intense. Only time can determine whether development on a large scale can be avoided. As far as long term preservation of the site is concerned, we are in the process of planning a detailed proposal to the European Community during 1997 for funds to prepare the site to be opened to the public. This would involve landscaping, the construction of open shelters above specific buildings in the S area (specifically the Greek sanctuary area and the S stoa with its kiln), a series of massive retaining walls, a drainage system that will ensure site preservation, as well as visitors' facilities. Next summer there will be another study season, when we also plan to clean the remainder of the central court of building T and to clarify certain architectural details in the S area. We will be com- pleting field research on Volume V and gradually turning to preparation of the monograph on Minoan House X. A preliminary report on the house is available (Hesperia 62 [1993] 129-61), but the architecture, the well-stratified floors which are so rich in pottery, frescoes, and small finds, and the domestic shrine, require more detailed presentation. When that publication is well under way we can consider a renewal of excavation activity." Malia. Sylvie Muller (French School) reports on the survey of the Plain of Malia in 1996: "The exploration of the plain of Malia needed a supplemen- tary campaign of 3 weeks in 1996. To start with we had to finish the work begun in 1995, revisiting the 50 sites discovered that year, recording their exact topographical coordinates with the aid of surveying equipment and filling in a descriptive card for each of them. Indeed, in view of the shortened campaign priority had been given to logging the greatest possible number of sites, the completion of the documentation on them being postponed to the following year. This decision proved justified this year, since we recorded the destruction by bulldozer of an M and R site at Stalida, by the sea in front of the Chapel of Agios Dimitrios (No.42). The quantity of pottery especially of LM III and of the R period and the blocks of dunary sandstone which we recorded on the surface in 1995 caused us to deplore the loss of such an important site. A brief supplementary exploration around Malia led to the discovery of an elevated site and a calderim across the slope on a hill on the S edge of the village. In addition, a knoll not built over produced a fine site of MM II and MM III-LM I in the middle of the modem village, about 100m from the beach and immediately W of the 'Sirens' hotel. The pottery and some worked blocks of sandstone were brought to light by the passage of a bulldozer, and it is feared that the plot may be earmarked for an imminent construction project. The next part of our survey covered the Arkovouno and the Sissi valley, in other words the E part of the area under exploration for the Malia survey project. On the Arkovouno, besides the site located in 1995 on the W edge of the plateau, we recorded a concentration of sherds of lesser importance a little NE of the highest point (occupied by a chapel under construction) and a MM site at the foot of the E slope around a group of ruined lodging houses. Over the whole plateau we observed a continuous and quite high level of 'background noise', in particular a quantity of fragmentary obsidian blades. Finally, the first Neolithic site of the area was discovered in an olive grove on the S slope, opposite the hill of Pyrgos all along the natural pass from W to E followed by the anc. road Malia- Sissi. No architectural remains appeared, but millstones and other polished and cut stone implements came from the stone walls which edge the recently planted fields of olive trees. The pottery collected is not wheel-made, and is character- ized by a coarse texture and a carefully polished reddish-brown surface (Fig. 107). Several recognizable shapes allow one to attribute this pottery to LN. Less than 100m to the SW, on the edge of the Malia-Sissi road, a huge quantity of EM pottery appeared in a field of olive trees recently ploughed. This concentration could indicate that the Neolithic site was moved in the following period. Part of the lithic material of these two last sites consists of schist pebbles of a deep red colour coming from anc. torrent beds in the Sissi area.</page><page sequence="110">110 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 107 In the area round Epano Sissi we should mention a Byz site and some sherds (mostly of LM III) round the chapel of Agia Anna to the S of the village. About 200m W of this chapel, we found a very big quantity of coarse pottery of MM II and MM III-LM I, mostly pithoi and big tripods, yet again in an olive grove recently ploughed, as the fresh breaks in the sherds suggest. These operations of preparing fields for olive cultivation unfortunately wipe out all trace of walls, of which there only remain piles of stones in the nearby ditches. At the entrance to the gorge of Selinari, all along the NE side of the ravine, we recorded the line of a calderim leading from Sissi to Neapoli. It stops neatly at the edge of the cliff at the point where the gorge narrows and where a bridge, now vanished, must have allowed one to cross the ravine and continue one's route on the S bank. About 100m downstream a mill of the Venetian or Turkish period stands on the NE bank, set a little back from the present course of the stream (Fig. 108). An ingenious piece of hydraulic engineering made it possible to turn the course of the Selinari upstream and thus fill a huge storage basin (partly destroyed by agricultural operations). From this basin, the water passed on an aqueduct supported by a wall with solid foundations and then was swallowed up in a chimney-shaped well to drive the mechanism of the two mill- stones found in situ in a square room at the foot of the chimney. The water left this room by a semi-circular opening and flowed into the stream, whose course then flowed past just below the building. The anc. alluvial river beds are clearly visible in a stratigraphy accidentally created in the storage basin by the agricultural operations mentioned above. Between the mill and the present course of the stream an imposing supporting wall, cyclopean in appearance, could possibly be the remains of a M bridge. In the area of Sissi, the hill of the Bouphos was the object of a systematic sherding operation, in order to define the periods of occupation of this well-known site. The pottery covers all periods of the BA. Besides this, some fragments of bg ware and terra sigillata belong to the historical period. The only major concentration of LM I-III pottery appears in the deep cut made in the hill when a new road was built to the hotel 'Kalimera Kriti'. At the SW foot of the hill, a wall of cyclopean appearance, also cut by the road, could have been part of a fortification wall. Ca 100m S of the road, a very strong concentration of fine pottery of MM II (in particular carinated cups) was found in an area of whitish earth without associated walls. Byz pottery came from the area round the chapel situated just to the S of the Bouphos. On the slope between Epano Sissi and the Bouphos, on the W side of the ravine descending from the NE foot of the Anavlochos, a major accumulation of LM III pottery appeared in the building debris of a septic tank beside a house under construction. The site connected with it must have been at least partially destroyed by the foundations of this house. Immediately S of the football ground of Sissi, outside the village to the SW, a semi-spherical mill-stone and some LR pottery indicate the presence of a settlement of late antiquity. At the same time, a few M sherds shows that the choice of this site goes back to prehistory. On a hill S of the Bouphos we discovered a necropolis of ChTs. Only one is open and probably emptied, its dromos facing W. With a length of about 5m, it descends with a steep slope towards a small chamber with a vaulted ceiling which opens on the right-hand side onto a bigger area (about 2.5m across) dug at a lower level. We were able to record two other tombs, one thanks to the partial caving in of the ceiling of the chamber under the roots of an olive tree, the other by the depression formed by the beginning of the dromos. Along the bank we relocated and mapped the old excava- tions of C. Davaras at the place called Kremasma, (K Chron 17 [1963] 405; A Delt 19 [1964] II, 442) immediately E of the E edge of the modem village. About 200m SW of the village, on a plateau whose W edge is formed by the Selinari ravine, we noted a concentration of MM II pottery and we collected an axe of green stone near the greenhouses, again without associated architectural remains. All along the coast to the W of the village at the level of the Sissi camp-site, a quarry of 'ammouda' (dunary sandstone) reveals very clear evidence of the extraction of blocks (Fig. 109). Besides this, a little W of the quarry, a sort of artificial basin dug deep into the rock could have been used as a shelter or as a repair-yard for boats. Still farther to the W, between the Sissi camp-site and the Agia Varvara hotel, another quarry of 'ammouda' is revealed by a long rectangular hole and some perpendicular cuts forming blocks to be detached (Fig. 110). Finally, we explored the high hill of Kephala which towers over the Selinari gorge from the SW. In a saddle just S of the summit a small concentration of coarse M pottery and some sherds of Byz glazed ware lead one to suppose that there was a shepherd's hut or a small shelter there which curiously enough offered no view of the Selinari gorge or the Sissi valley. Around Kephala, along the earth road passing S of the hill (at the place where it drops back towards the National Road), we must also Fig. 108</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 111 Fig. 111 Fig. 109 Fig. 110 draw attention to a M site under a ruined house which probably covers the remains of PR walls. At the W foot of Kephala we found a big concentration of M and Byz sherds around the chapel of Agios Nikolaos, as well as a supporting wall probably dating back to the M period. Only the E edge of the valley of Sissi and the pass towards the valley of Milatos could not be explored. The results show that the geology of the Sissi area, cut into by two deep ravines running down on either side of the Anavlochos, differs from the plain of Malia (W of the Arkovouno) as do the surface soils as a result, but the quality of the clay and the pottery shapes are closely similar. The total number of sites (including the quarries) recorded in the plain of Malia in 1995-1996 amounts to 85 without counting the palace and ruins of Prophitis Elias." A. Allegrette (French School) reports on work on the hypostyle crypt in 1996: "The campaign was directed by Alvaro Allegrette with the collaboration of Martin Schmid, the architect, who was in charge of the clearance, repair and restoration of the structure. General clearance and repair: the aim was to repair the system of protection of the crypt against water dripping down outside the building. The drainage channels put in place in the 1960s all along the N wall of the crypt were dismantled. It was also necessary to dismantle some iron posts which were holding up the old plastic roof of the crypt. These posts had been placed on cement bases. The work of terracing necessary for their removal allowed us to check the level at which the preceding excavators had stopped in 1961-64. After this work, a new system to protect the crypt from dripping water was put in place: low dry stone walls were built along the N side of the crypt as far as the end of the roofing. Before their construction, a cleaning operation enabled us to understand better the relationship between the 'KA' area and the monument. The blocking wall of stone constructed at the beginning of the 60s on the wall of sideropetra was removed (Fig. 111). We also proceeded to fill in the old test trenches to the SW of the palace. General clearance of the monument included the main building, the area to the S of the crypt (B1-B2), the area between the crypt and the 'KA' area, the door of the shops of the agora and the gutter parallel to the sea road. The purpose of this clearance of the monument and its surroundings was to allow a detailed study. For that we used the excavation notebooks and the photographic files as reference material in order to ascertain the extent of the work previously done. During the clearance we removed a thick layer of sand which covered almost all of the S side of the crypt. Under that we found in places a very loose layer of earth fill; the clearance stopped at the first archaeological layer encountered. We also</page><page sequence="112">112 DAVID BLACKMAN :_ :i~_. --I -ii;~ d|Bl~a~ |As examples we mention: the discovery of a column base on a supporting slab in the centre of the sector B2 (Fig. 112); the recovery of a stucco floor beside the W wall of the shops of the crypt on the E side of this area, recorded by van Effenterre in his excavation notebook of 1960-61 but not mentioned in the publication, the discovery of the site of another column base between the stucco floor and the base of the column in B2. There was perhaps a portico in sector B2. On the E side of this area small almost parallel stone alignments were refound which were connected with a large slab of sideropetra farther to the E (Fig. 113). In the interior of the crypt we rediscovered on the ground traces of a passage with bays or a primitive polythyron between rooms 1 and 2 (Fig. 114); a change of level in the E . , ,part of the floor of room 2 which suggests that the boundary between this room and room 3 might be more to the E, since this change of level seems to mark the boundary between the Fig. 112 rooms of the crypt; the discovery of a cavity in the central part of the last step of the W stairway aligned with the holes for the wooden posts on the same step. The presence, at the S end of the W wall of the crypt, of an extension of the wall which makes a turn to the W, suggests an entrance which enlarges the present boundaries of the building, as found on the plan supplied in the volume on the agora [Henri van Effenterre, Malia, centre politique I--L'agora (1960-1966), plan I (Et. Cr_t., XVII)] but not on the plan of the crypt [Marie-Claire Amouretti, Malia, centre politique II--La crypte hypostyle (1957-1962), plan I (Et. Cret., XVIII)]. On the N side, on the outside of the crypt between the bases of the Bent Portico of areas A5 and A6, we found two superimposed layers of calderim separated by a very thin layer of earth (about 0.03-0.05m thick). In area A5 near the base of column 4 a stuccoed calderim was found. Apart from these activities, the study of the pottery from the test trenches dug round the crypt in 1988-89 was continued. All the samples found during the clearance work were put in the new apotheke in room 11, rows 9-12, with the material from the test trenches in the crypt carried out in 1988-89 by Alexandre Farnoux (BCH 113,1989,768-771; 114,1990,921). The whole N area and part of the S area were filled in except for the W part of B2 (which has a stuccoed surface), the loggia of B 1 and the stuccoed floor inside the crypt and some shops. Conclusions: After this season's work we filled in the areas outside the building with earth and sand for their protection. The clearance of the crypt is almost finished. A more detailed study of the W and S of the building seems necessary in order Fig. 113 started a series of new plans and recordings of the structure and its surroundings to complete and correct the earlier plans. The most outstanding results of this stage were: demarcation i i~~ of the real extent of the excavations of van Effenterre, observation of important details not previously noted, and a gathering of pottery, bone and obsidian samples for a new study of the chronology of the occupation of this area.

However this may be, occupation of terrace B2 to the S of the crypt during the neopalatial period now seems proved by the abundant remains of MM IIIB-LM IA found in areas B1 and B2. The evidence of such occupation is less clear on the N side, but proof of occupation from the prepalatial to the neopalatial period has been found there. Inside the crypt we found evidence which could prove the occupation of the building during the protopalatial period and its reoccupation in the neopalatial period." Mesambelies. On the building plot of E. Papalas (Odos Eumathiou), a ChT was found partly destroyed at a depth of 2m. The chamber was circular with the dromos only partly preserved. No dating was possible as the chamber was empty. Two skeletons were found someway to the N with MM pottery. (ADelt 393-4) Pediada. Kastelli. The corer of a MM IB building was found on the M. Stavroulakis plot. The few associated vases included typical carinated and conical cups. In Plateia Meidani, a MM IB-II settlement was found with earlier levels showing that Kastelli was occupied from N onwards (pottery and two stone axes). There was also some EM in a grey to black clay. Vases typical of the MM Pediada workshop included straight-sided and carinated cups (ADelt Pl.154a-P) with other types all in the local reddish clay. A zoomorphic rhyton with white linear decoration is also notable, as are sherds of a closed vase with incised decoration, perhaps Knossian in origin (ADelt P1. 154acr). Part of a large room and a storeroom with two pithoi were excavated in levels above. Two plaster floors were identified with clear traces of red colouring and a circular hearth with ash in the middle. It could have been a kitchen on the basis of a tripod pot found in one comer. A pedestalled, burnished vase (ADelt P1.154r), as well as the earlier vase with incised decoration could well be Cycladic or Helladic in inspiration. In the Zacharias Petrakis plot, a wall 25m long was found associated with very little pottery but with the same orientation as the neopalatial 'central building' some 70m away. The neopalatial building, on the nursery school plot, was cleaned and conserved revealing a partition wall 0.90m thick. The building itself had been excavated in 1987-89. Beneath the HL layer, a destruction layer of the 2nd neopalatial period on a white plaster floor with many conical cups was revealed, beneath which was a red plaster floor of the 1st neopalatial phase. (ADelt 394-6) EASTERN CRETE Chalasmenos. William Coulson (ASCS) and Metaxia Tsipopoulou (24th Ephorate) continued their collaboration in 1996: "In 1996, the excavations were continued in two areas, A and B, opened in previous years. In both areas the house remains were found to be well preserved and in some places to exist up to a height of Im. The walls are constructed of carefully laid limestone blocks held together with mud mortar. Doorways, floors, hearths, and benches are features that are unusually well preserved and provide a good picture of the domestic architecture of the period. In area A, the majority of one large unit (unit 1) of at least seven rooms, and portions of two other units, have been uncovered to date. Unit 1 is important because it exhibits three architectural phases, all belonging to the same ceramic phase of late LM IIIC. In the first phase, the building appears to have consisted of two rooms, a large room in the NE spanning trenches A2 and A6, and a small room in the SW. In the second phase, the small room was enlarged, and entrances were placed on the E and N into the main room. In the third phase, the entire structure was enlarged to the E, and rooms were added at the W in trenches A7 and A8. In trench A7 was uncovered a layer of ash, in which was a kalathos decorated with pomegranates in the same manner as the kalathos from Tomb A discovered in 1992. In fact, so similar are the two vases in shape and decoration that it is likely that they are products of the same workshop. In the same burnt deposit were also found six beads, a second kalathos, an ivory cylinder, a mortar, and several stone tools. This deposit belongs to the same room where in 1992 was discovered a second layer of ash containing a bronze ring and a fine bull figurine. The presence of the ash, the character of the finds, and the similarity of the kalathos with that from the tomb all suggest that that room may have been used as a small shrine for a house cult. In the W part of the trench was found a lead male figurine of IIIC type. The use of lead as a material is quite unusual for the period and, together with the house cult, underscores the importance of unit 1. To date, 18 trenches have been opened in area B. A most interesting feature was uncovered in trench B5. This small horse-shoe shaped structure proved to be a tholos tomb which had been constructed after the abandonment of the LM IIIC house. The human bone material was very fragmentarily preserved, and few sherds were recovered. The most diagnostic ceramic fragments belong to a stirrup jar, whose baggy shape and stubby spout place it in the PG period and provide a date for the tomb. In trench B7 N occurs a room that can be identified as a kitchen: it had nine vases on the floor, along with stone tools and animal bones. In B7 S is another room which may be identified as a storage area for vessels to be used in the adjacent kitchen in B 1, and is connected to the kitchen by a door in its SW corner. The room in B8 can also be identified as a storage space and work area, since it contained numerous fragments of pithoi, stone tools, and mortars. In B 13, part of a room with an entrance to the E was uncovered. Close to the E wall was found the small figurine of a woman with upraised arms resting in a cup with a miniature juglet next to it. The presence of such a figurine suggests that the room, like the one of unit 1 in area A, might have been used for a house cult. A third house cult may be identified in the adjacent room in B11, where an ashy deposit yielded the figurine of a ram together with small fragments of human figurines. The work accomplished in area B helps in the identification of the use of the rooms and in understanding the circulation patterns within the individual units." Chrysokamino. Philip P. Betancourt reports on the 1996 season of excavations: "The excavations uncovered a metallurgy workshop engaged in the smelting of copper. It consists of a small hut of perishable materials, with a soil floor, 2.6 x 3.5m in size. The small building is apsidal, with a hearth inside. EM III sherds were found on the floor. Three soil floors were found, one over the other, all from EM III. The building was re-buried at the end of the season. Also at the workshop are large quantities of slag, fragments of furnace fragments, animal bones, pottery sherds, and stone tools. The smelting furnaces, reconstructed from the evidence</page><page sequence="114">114 DAVID BLACKMAN of small fragments, were probably small cylinders open at the top. They were used only once, and they were broken to remove the copper from the slag. Because no trace of copper ore has been found in this vicinity, it is believed that the ore was brought in by sea. Near the workshop are later M buildings. A three-roomed structure, representing the latest building on the site, was completely revealed. It appears to be a modestly built farm- house probably constructed in the LM IIIA:2 period but possibly continuing in use until LM IIIB-C. Evidence for earlier building phases appeared in the form of earlier walls, found at a lower level within the rooms. The pottery ranged in date from FN/EM I to LM IIIC, with sherds from LM I-LM IIIA:2 being most numerous. In addition to these three rooms, trenches were opened to the N and E of room 1, to the W and E of room 3, and one trench approximately 20m E of room 3. Remains of earlier walls and rooms were found, but they need further study. Finds from LM III included sherds, stone hand tools, several querns, a lead piece, a sealstone, clay and stone loomweights, a triton shell, two stone vessels, a bronze dagger blade, ash, charcoal, shells, and some fragmentary animal bones. The bronze dagger, the sealstone, and the complete vases were taken to the Agios Nikolaos Museum." Gournia Project. L.V. Watrous reports on the 1996 study season: "Artifacts recovered during the survey were prepared for publication. H. Blitzer and P. Gleeson studied the post-R pottery from the survey (EByz through LOtt). Their studies indicate that the Isthmus was well populated during the EByz, Venetian and Ott periods. The local sequence of coarseware fabrics and shapes for these periods was identified. H. Blitzer and K. Papadakis (University of Crete) studied the ground and chipped stone from the survey. Raw materials, tool types and chronological groupings were identified by period. A. Kossyva (University of Crete) completed her study of the R pottery. She identified the location and ceramic types of a local ceramic production center. D. Haggis completed his study of local BA ceramic fabrics. He also studied the fabrics and shapes of the LM IIIC-O pottery. L.V. Watrous prepared the A-C pottery for publication. He also finished the text of the site catalogue. Artifacts were photographed and drawn for publication. The geology of the survey area was studied." Kavousi. William D.E. Coulson, Geraldine C. Gesell and Leslie Preston Day report on the 1996 study season: "In the summer of 1996, progress was made in the study of objects from the excavations at Kavousi (Vronda and Kastro). For Vronda, studies were made in three areas: a) conservation of the goddesses with upraised hands from the shrine (building G); b) study and conservation of the vases from Graves 4 through 36; and c) study of the objects from buildings C-E and I-O-N on the site. In addition to the above, study was completed on the human remains from the graves with the objective of examining the evidence for family use of the graves and possible connections between them and the other cemeteries at Kavousi. All the cranial bone fragments were examined and scored for non-metric traits. These are genetic- based variations and anomalies which occur on human crania and may show clustering within family units. A database for this information was created by the project's computer specialist, and all data were entered into it. For the material from the excavations on the Kastro, emphasis was placed on the study of the PG deposits from the W Slope, including those from the end of PG. The aim was to define the parameters of the G and LG styles and associated phases of habitation. In this respect, all the pottery from rooms 21-26 was studied and drawn. It is expected that, by September 1998, all major ceramic studies on the Kastro pottery will have been completed in preparation for the writing of the final manuscripts on the architecture, pottery, small finds, and other objects from the site." Itanos. The French School reports on the 1996 season: "Work was carried out on several different sites: Basilica A. Work was concentrated to the E of the apse of the sanctuary and in the central and N naves: (a) To the E of the apse of the sanctuary: the excavation at the back of the apse provided no chronological data because of the disruption of the stratigraphy by old excavations; on the other hand, it is now certain that the apse belonged to the oldest phase of the monument and could even belong to a building earlier than the church. (b) Work undertaken in the N nave finished at its E end with the excavation of a destruction layer composed essentially of blocks from the E wall of the second phase, as well as blocks from the N outer wall. This destruction occurred after the exca- vations of the last century which had reached bedrock, as attested by the total absence of finds. The traces of three dif- ferent ground levels did, however, appear: a floor of ceramic tiles partly covered by the E wall of the N nave of the second phase; a floor of small pebbles; and a plastered floor. (c) Two test trenches were also sunk in the central nave. The first, on the site of the sanctuary screen, very quickly reached bedrock (at level + 8.24m) without producing any material, exactly like the second trench, sunk in the interior of the N apse, which did not reveal the existence of a stylobate between the naves of the basilica. Habitation area. The aim of the 1996 season was to extend the excavation to the W and the S in order to obtain fuller information on the different architectural complexes and the general topography of this area. Three areas were opened (IV-VI), to the W (V) and to the S (IV &amp; VI) of the test trenches dug in 1995 which enabled us to define more precisely the phases already revealed in the previous year: Phase I: For this period the most interesting aspect was the checking, at various points, of the walls found earlier, and the possiblity, still to be verified, that the whole complex might have constituted a single dwelling. Phase II: This phase, immediately preceding that of the houses, is difficult to define clearly at the present stage of our study, though we observe some correspondence, in spite of some exceptions, between the walls of this period and those of phase I. These two phases may be dated between the 5th and 7th Ct and thus relate to the history of an habitation area. Phase III: This phase, datable to the middle and late Imperial period, is characterized by the existence of a N-S road axis with gutter and facades of E-W rooms which reveal several phases of use and restoration. Phase IV: To this period we can assign the building with a tile floor already partly identified last year as well as the pebble paving (of a street?) which runs the length of the N side, and probably also the N-S axis in its earliest phase which runs the length of the W side. All these remains seem to belong to the 3rd Ct BC. N Necropolis. After the work of clearance undertaken in</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 115 1995 in the heart of the vast necropolis which extends to the N of the anc. town, we continued this year the study of the monumental funerary complex excavated by the French School in 1950. The aim was two-fold: to define the architectural arrangement and the chronology of the remains that are still visible, and to integrate this monumental complex into the topography of the anc. necropolis. We therefore dug various test trenches both round and in the middle of the monument, in preparation for an extensive excavation of the area. We have thus been able to show an almost continuous occupation of this area of the N necropolis of Itanos from the end of the 8th Ct BC., doubtless until the beginning of the Imperial period. This occupation has brought with it the destruction of several funerary groups which, from the A period at least, seem to be arranged around a N-S axis which runs along a ridge in the direction of the N peninsula, crossing, at the top of the hill on which the N necropolis stands, an oval structure around which can be seen on the surface large amounts of fine pottery of good quality. Chora. (a) Some topographical surveying together with a close examination of the structures was undertaken on the site of Travouni to the NE of Itanos, as well as at the place called 'tou Pithariou to Langkadi', to the NW of Bamies in the direction of Trapezes. (b) A detailed examination and surface survey was conducted on a little hill below the summit of Bamies and in the immediate vicinity. We also finished the topographical surveying, adding two walls situated on the SW side of the valley which possibly form a part of the system of planning of this territory. We also defined the arrangement of the upper terrace of the little hill and clarified, as far as possible, the limits of a building recorded already in 1994 (cf. BCH 119 [1995] 734-6; fig.16). The surface pottery confirmed the nature of this complex, active at least from the A period to the HL period. Other Activities. (a) This year we continued our recon- naissance of the line of the rampart, with some very limited clearance in order to facilitate the topographical survey. (b) The Cretan Polytechnic Institute continued their geo- physical research in different parts of the city and mainly in the W part beyond the W acropolis and the modem road, on relatively flat ground, in order to try to define the limits of the anc. city. (c) Four fragments of inscriptions were brought to light or discovered on the surface." Mochlos. Jeff Soles (ASCS) reports: "The 1996 season at Mochlos was a study season which was spent completing the first of five projected volumes reporting on the excavations at Mochlos conducted from 1989 to 1994. Soles and C. Davaras are the editors of the publication series, but each volume is a collaborative publication which involves the work of many other scholars as well. Volume II, Part 1, in the Mochlos Publication Series, will be Mochlos Period III: Neopalatial Settlement on the Coast. We also began preparation of the second volume in the publication series, Volume III: Mochlos Period IV: Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetery." Palaikastro. Fieldwork was continued at Palaikastro in 1996, under the direction of J.A. MacGillivray and L.H. Sackett (BSA). They report: "Six teams worked in the area of building 6, which had been opened in 1994 (Fig. 115). Tests were made in the pier and door hall (room A) and through its facade into and across 'Main Fig. 115 Street' and also in the peristyle courtyard (H). The unexcavated rooms at the SW comer of the building (rooms B-E and L) were cleared to MM IIIA and in places to earlier levels. The SE comer of the building, where in 1994 part of a suggested monumental entrance or 'propylaia' had been found, was cleared of a substantial overlay; and further work, including a deep sounding, was carried out at the NE (area N). Dr J. Driessen continued his work as architect, and took air photographs. A separate GPR survey team under the direction of Prof. Floyd McCoy continued work in the harbour area and near Block Chi, with intriguing results, especially on the con- figuration of the probable M harbour. The primary aim of the season's campaign to complete the excavation of the LM IA building was fulfilled. It was con- firmed that scrappy LM IA deposits lay on the latest floors and that the building was dismantled before the end of this period. The only substantial late pottery deposit, which included an interesting twin vase (Fig. 116), a strainer with plastic bird on its mouth and basket handle (LM II/IIIA1), came from the area indicated in 1903-4 as a possible entrance from 'Main Street'; this must belong to the post-building phase, when the plot was used as an open area with two wells (starting in LM IB). Further deposits of volcanic ash were found, the most interesting being in a drain at the north side of 'Main Street' where it fell after the original street facade of building 6 had been dismantled, but before a new, inferior, perimeter wall had been constructed to delimit what was now an open area. This drain, which had been constructed on the N side of a well-built narrow paved way (not unlike the 'Royal Road' at Knossos)</page><page sequence="116">116 DAVID BLACKMAN 90 ii ; i ,K Kamare _ ,W r ; .cup 96/93 (,. /2:. Kamares Ware cup 96/5938 (c. 1/2) / Twin vase (LMII) (c.1/2) Fig. 116 was subsequently filled with packing. and it was possible to trace a sequence of road renovations through the following LM IB, LM II and LM IIIA periods, the latter being the one previously uncovered and the only one known so far. As excavation within the various rooms proceeded, it became clear that this was not primarily an LM IA building, but that it had a long and complex history. It will be safer to characterize it more generally as neopalatial. The main walls, and probably also the courtyard plan interpreted in 1994 as a LM IA construction, belong to the MM III period(s) and were re-used. An important sequence of deposits was found, showing first a primary MM IIIA use which ended in a fire destruction. There followed a major rebuild and a series of destructions punctuated by earthquake and flood. The fullest and clearest sequence was found in room L, a fine paved and frescoed room in the MM IIIA phase whose mud-brick steps were later built over by a new stone slab construction linking Fig. 117 with the paved court peristyle (probably in both MM IIIB and LM IA). A rich MM IIIB deposit was found at the SE, close to the large paving slabs of our 'propylaia'. Here a well ordered cupboard (R1: Fig. 117), containing some 150 pots shaken down by an earthquake, was fully preserved possibly because later built over by a paved LM IA porch (now lost to erosion). Evidence of similar construction, occupation and earthquake destruction was found at the NE side of the building, at the entrance to room N. Here deep tests showed that early deposits proceeded beneath the level of the NE sector of the neo-palatial court. Both here at the NE and beneath the extreme SW corer of the peristyle court (H), tests gave good evidence of an earlier (MM II) building phase. The finds included very fine- eggshell thin-decorated Kamares Ware (Fig. 116). While it is not yet possible to determine the ground plan of this phase, we can say with certainty that it was of a high quality. Floors were raised and bedded on a thick layer of fine yellow clay and finished with a red-plaster surface. These finds opened a whole new perspective on the building 6 area. A MM II structure of quality had existed here before being built over in the neopalatial periods. The LM IA phase was only a late re-use of the building and saw its final destruction and demolition well before the late (Theran) LM IA stage. From then on this was an open area used for the placement of public wells during LM IB, with some use continuing into LM III."</page><page sequence="117">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 117 Praisos. James Whitley reports on the 1996 study season: "Work continued on studying material picked up in the 1993 and 1994 fieldwalking seasons of the Praisos survey, and in particular on material from the urban survey of Praisos itself. The objective was to determine the phases of occupation of this major site from surface remains alone. Investigation continued of the relationship between fabrics (of which we now have 36) and sherds datable by typological or stylistic criteria. It appears that there is a range of fabrics common to the BA and EIA and another range characteristic of the PG through to ER, which in turn are quite distinct from those of the LR and later historical periods. However, great difficulty was encountered in providing a more fine-grained chronology for most of the surface finds; the absence of a sequence of well-stratified, published post-M deposits from E Crete is a real handicap. (It is at least clear that the E Cretan sequence has few points of similarity with the Knossian). We are confident, however, that more petrographic and typological study, and closer collaboration between ourselves and the French excavators at Itanos, will help us to refine our chronology. Some definite conclusions can nonetheless be drawn from this season's work. We managed to identify some terracottas from one of the votive deposits on Praisos originally excavated by Bosanquet. It seems that there was some occupation of Praisos in LM IIIC and PG times-that is to say, there is some considerable overlap between the occupation on Praisos and that of the refuge settlement above Kalamafki. There was also some G and A occupation on Praisos itself. Unsurprisingly perhaps, the majority of surface finds seem to date to the C and HL periods, and there are few if any ER finds." SE Crete. Archaeological Land Survey. N. Schlager (Vienna University) reports on his surface survey of 1996: "This survey charted 44 ancient to moder ruins and sites in the extreme SE corer of Crete, in the communities of Ziros and Agia Triada (once called Tso), which lie in the eparchy of Sitia. Very few of these sites are known from the literature; the majority were found and recorded in 1987 and 1988 through extensive surface surveys by N. Schlager (see AR 1988-89, 106). The aim of the campaign of 1996 was to record in their present state the monuments of archaeological, historical and folk-history interest, without interfering with the state of the ruins. Description, improved charting and recording by photograph and drawing formed the basis of the work on site, which concentrated on the four districts of Limnia, Chametoulo, Aspro Nero and Phovolies in the mountainous region SE to S of the plateau of Ziros. At the edge of the small karst plain of Epano Limnia, at the location called 'Sto Dasos', M remains with the present-day name of 'Paralaki Mantra', already recognized by Sir Arthur Evans in 1896, were recorded. The present name points to rebuilding and additions, in the 40s and 50s, when a large cattle-pen with a one-roomed hut was built above and close by the M remains. The groundplan shows a central room with a W fagade of roughly worked limestone blocks, facing a free space in front (Fig. 118). The entrance was probably on the E. Additions and outbuildings complete the complex, which according to K. Davaras belongs to the neopalatial period of the pottery phases MM III-LM II and must be interpreted as a high-class country house or, in the terminology of the 'Minoan Roads Project' as 'Metriko Phylakio'. To it belong, as a kind of highway station, an architecturally arranged small rocky plateau farther S, a large 'Cyclopean' wall segment in the W Fig. 118 Fig. 119 and a cemetery on a flat hill in the SW part of the plain. At the S edge of the village Chametoulo, the remains at the location Aletourgio or Vrysi, already briefly described by K. Davaras in the 70s, were added to the plan, as well as several views of the wall. This truly 'Cyclopean' wall, which can be followed for over 150m, is impressive, although largely covered by recent garden- and olive-terraces (Fig. 119). This is certainly the central area of a settlement of the palace period, the 2nd millennium BC, with several buildings no less monumental than the town houses of Kato Zakro. At the location Dochi, between the N edge of Chametoulo and the deep ravine of Lamnoni and Xerokampos, John Pendlebury had already observed anc. walls, as well as MM III, LM I, LM III and R sherds. The area is now covered by fruit- and olive-trees and gave no clear indication of what it looked like in antiquity, although a terracotta phallus found here-if it is votive-leads to the conclusion that there was a small anc. sanctuary on the road from Xerokampos to the plain of Chametoulo. A focal point of the documentation work carried out in summer 1996 was the area of Aspro Nero, which lies about 1.5km S of Chametoulo. The name comes from a recent spring, which waters gardens and fields in the upper reaches of a very fertile valley. The disintegrating ruins of the Kelia monastery at the E edge of the valley have been altered and rebuilt so much that their original state is no longer recognisable, but planning</page><page sequence="118">118 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 120 of the structure and local information allowed a few important conclusions: originally the monastery church seems to have been a small katholikon dedicated to the Panagia, which today is completely buried. Only a heap of stones shows its position. By its side lies a church, once probably dedicated to Agios Georgios, but now no longer in use, which still shows remains of coloured frescoes, especially in the apse. The orientation of the church is unusual: it faces N, with its apse in the S, for which there is so far no apparent analogy in Crete. The entrance would have been in the E long side and perhaps faced the supposed Panagia church. Here, too, a few frescoes remain, which, like those in the apse, show similarities with the frescoes in the S nave of the famous Panagia Kera in Kritsa and therefore presumably belong to the early 14th Ct. The inner cloister seems too small for two contemporary churches and raises the question whether Agios Georgios was not the trapeza of the monastery, which could also have had frescoes. The opposite, W slope has vertical rocks over 50m high. At the foot of the most N cliff the post-Byz church of Agios Antonios has been built in a large, shelter-like cave. Exactly above it and following the cliff edge from N to S lies a fortifi- cation wall of 'Cyclopean' masonry with strong bastions at either end (Fig. 120). The bastions seem to be connected by man-made terracing and a wall now largely destroyed. Each bastion has a stronger, quadrangular to rectangular N part, with a S part built of smaller material, arranged in such a way that a kind of stronghold is formed between. If the mighty 'Cyclopean' walls of the two bastions are an indication of height, the picture emerges of a tower-like fortress at the edge of the cliff, which must have looked like a Med citadel of robber knights. The pottery found, together with the Cyclopean walls, suggest a date in the second millennium BC, although more precise dating is at present impossible. There are no immediate comparisons in the M or Myc architecture of Crete with the extremely exposed situation of this ruin. Nearest to what it must have looked like in the Bronze Age is perhaps the picture of a fortified town on the so-called Master Impression from Chania and a group of buildings, also fortified with towers, on a sealing from Kato Zakros. With the discovery and publication of the fortress of Aspro Nero, the thesis of open and unprotected settlements in M Crete must be revised. Finally, the recording of the settlement of Phovolies, mentioned for the first time in 1938 by Fritz Schachermeyr, confirmed its importance, already recognized then, for settlement continuity from the BA to C times, even in a remote area, which is today totally uninhabited. The situation of the place on a long saddle between Agia Triada and the coastal strip S of it, with a view deep into the mountainous hinterland to the N and of the island of Kouphonisi off the coast to the S, clearly attracted settlers much earlier: LN or FN and EBA sherds scattered over hundreds of metres indicate that Phovolies was one of the larger open-country settlements in the first half of the 4th millennium BC." Vrokastro. Barbara Hayden and Jennifer Moody report: "The purpose of the 1996 study season was two-fold: to continue pottery analyses, especially the fabric or petrographic analysis of sherds collected from sites and on-transect. This was conducted by Jennifer Moody. The second goal was to complete the recording of anc. to Turkish-period sites by revisiting these sites. The pottery study included completion of drafting of pottery profiles, completing the catalogue forms, and obtaining measurements and Munsells where necessary. Catalogue numbers were put on cards enclosed with all catalogued sherds, and missing sack numbers were identified for the final list of catalogued sherds. The fabric study concentrated on categories of ware groups in an attempt to ascertain more precise dates for these wares. Included in this group are Marble ware (associated primarily with FN-EM I), Hearth ware (FN-EM I), various wares tempered either with granodiorite exclusively, or with granodiorite in combination with quartz, siltstone, gold mica, and chaff temper. These wares range from EM III to Gr and occur in a variety of shapes, with storage and cooking shapes predominating. Other wares examined include LM IIIC-EIA fabrics (a quartz-tempered cooking ware, metamorphic 'glitter' ware), a transitional quartz and chert cooking fabric (Protopalatial to Neopalatial)." WESTERN CRETE Agia Photeini, Amariou. Kyriakakis plot: excavations revealed extensive remains of three houses that dated to the HL and the R period. In one of the houses remains of many phases were visible including a flag floor and a clay layer. The three phases of the house date from the mid 1st Ct BC to the late 3rd Ct AD. In another of the buildings there was a floor of beaten earth preserved in the S. Finds included iron objects, charred animal bone, ceramics such as basins and amphoras, and lamps; metal objects such as pins and needles; domestic objects made of bone; and also a bronze Herm. In the same building there were traces of burning on the floor and underneath the floor was a pipe running EW. Parts of the walls of the buildings were preserved to a height of 1.40m, some built of limestone blocks. Outside of the building bronze and silver coins were discovered. (ADelt 433-4) Apladiana Mylopotamou. During road widening a cist grave was discovered, oriented EW. Associated finds date the grave to the 3rd Ct AD. Atsipadhes Korakias. The 1996 study season of the tsipadhes Korakias peak sanctuary was undertaken in Rethymnon in July and avgust. The team was directed by Dr Alan Peatfield (University College Dublin), and Dr Christine Morris (Trinity College Dublin) with the support of Ms Maria Vlasaki, Director of the West Cretan Ephorate. Great progress was made on the study of the figurines. Dr Peatfield and Dr Morris report:</page><page sequence="119">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 119 Fig. 121 "The completion of the washing of all the figurines in 1995 meant that their study was able to make great progress in this year's season, 1996. The space made available to us this year in Rethymnon Museum allowed us to strew the figurine fragments in their zembil groups for the very first time. In some cases we were able to strew the figurine fragments alongside the pottery from the same zembils. This revealed some important joins and fabric matches. In the seven weeks we were able to complete the strewing and cataloguing of figurines from all the B trenches (B7, B8, B9, B10, B1 and W baulks), and from C8 and 9. This leaves trenches C10, D9, D10, E9, E10-which could be completed in single season at the same work rate, hopefully in 1997. The pottery study focused on the study of the FN pottery in preparation for the paper offered at the Cretological Conference in 1996. Three papers associated with the Project were presented at the Cretological Conference in September: 'Minoan religion for ordinary people' (A.A.D. Peatfield); 'Early pottery from the Atsipadhes peak sanctuary' (C.E. Morris, V. Batten); 'Ayios Vasilios Valley archaeological survey: preliminary report' (A.A.D. Peatfield, S. Markoulaki, J.A. Moody). Figurines. Human: gender distribution. The issue of gender differentiation has previously been an issue in the interpretation of peak sanctuaries, especially in relation to Jouktas and Petsophas. The identification of the gender of fragments is, however, extremely difficult. To test the problem, therefore, we counted only fragments whose gender could be certainly distinguished: hips, loincloths, legs, stands (male); skirts, torso pegs (female) (Fig. 121). This produced some interesting results: as yet male and female figurines seem to be more or less equally divided overall; there seems, however, to be a distinct dimorphism in the spatial distribution of the genders of the figurines within the area of the sanctuary. In trenches B9/10/11 and W baulks (i.e. the area directly E of the upper terrace feature) there seems to be a predominance of female figurines, but in trenches B7/8 to the S there are more male ones. In C8/9 the figurine genders are difficult to determine; there are few diagnostic fragments, and by contrast there is a large proportion of figurines with column bodies. These column-body figurines seem to be limited to one area of the site, the S section of C/D/E. Gestures: types &amp; distribution. The commonest worship gesture is observed among the figurines from trenches A and B: hands held to the front of the chest, just below the breasts. This seems to be adopted by both male and female figurines. The Fig. 122 figurines from trenches C8/9, however, mostly seem to have upraised arms, some curved around to the front. At least one figurine has arms raised to different levels: one head-level, the other chest-level (Fig. 122). This seems to indicate a differential distribution of worship gestures on the site, a point which merits further study. Animal genders. We also decided to test the distribution of the genders of the cattle figurines (Fig. 123). It proved signifi- cant: about two-thirds of the appropriate cattle fragments have clear indications of gender, roughly equally divided male and female. The female cattle are also shown with small udders, which may be associated with the use of cattle as plough ani- mals rather than as dairy animals. The implications of this are discussed in Peatfield's paper for the Cretological Conference. In summary, it does suggest certain differences between the symbolism of cattle figurines as offerings and the meaning of the bull in palatial iconography. We also note that there are concentrations of cattle figurines in areas A and B, and apparently fewer in area C. This will be checked in future study seasons.</page><page sequence="120">120 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 123 Pottery. Study focused on the FN pottery (reported at the Cretological Conference). The date of the pottery as FN is established by comparison with similar material, based on the specialist advice. The shapes of the pots bear comparisons with material known from FN caves, and reveal links both with W Crete and with S Crete (Asterousia) (Fig. 124). We now have an almost complete distribution of the FN on the site, demonstrating a concentration in the S of the lower terrace. We can also discern a stratigraphy in trenches C8 &amp; C9. The lower zembils have up to 80-90% FN. In one case, a small pit, the pottery is pure FN; there were also no figurines from this pit. It is worth repeating that no figurines have been found in the same fabric as the FN. Similarly there is no domestic debris (bones, ash, stone tools) associated with this material. While this material relates to other N material found high in the Cretan mountains, it also raises important issues about its relation to the later peak sanctuary and thus the history of the peak sanctuary cult. Similarly, the possibility that this material may reveal a previously unrecognized ritual assemblage is relevant to recent considerations of the N/EM ritual landscape." Axos, Mylopotamos. (Property of G. Daphermos.) The second excavation on this site, in 1991, brought to light tombs from the HL to R periods (Fig. 125), although in 1983, tombs ranging from A-R had been found. Few tombs had many finds but tomb 14 was of particular interest in that it had a PG stirrup-jar. Figurines were collected from the fills of tombs and these are dated from A to CL. (ADelt 431-3) Fig. 124 Chamalevri. (Property of D. Stratidakis.) Test excavations began in 1990 at the site of Bolanis with a view to exploring all periods but concentrating on the extensive M settlement to the N of Chamalevri. These investigations follow on from the important work of both the British (BSA 69 [1974] 62-66) and the Germans (AA 1982 17-47). There were five test trenches. EM III/MM IA pits were found as well as deposits of early LM IIIC pottery. Area I was used in EM III/MM IA for refuse disposal and as a cult area in early LM IIIC. The earlier pottery was characterized by handleless cups and painted sherds with light-on-dark decoration and some poly- chromy. All pottery was handmade apart from some very few examples of pots made with the slow wheel. One sherd bore a seal impression; this and others were presented at the Clermont-Ferrand congress in 1992 (CMMS, 5, Berlin 1995, 260-262). The LM IIIC deposits resemble those of Sybrita in the Amari valley, including a substantial amount of animal bone (Late Minoan III Pottery. Chronology and Terminology. E. Hallager and B.P. Hallager eds. 1997). The pottery included deep bowls with spirals and antithetic streamers (ADelt P1.162at). A fine crater shows birds arranged antithetically either side of a plant (ADelt PI.163ac). In area II, four walls were found dating to LH IIIC early: painted skyphoi and pithoi as well as two sherds of the LM IIIB Chania workshop. EM III/MM IA pottery was found everywhere, attesting to the remains of the earlier settlement. (ADelt 426-9) Chania. The excavation of a third rock-cut ChT in front of the Church of the Apostles Peter and Paul was completed. It had a</page><page sequence="121">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 121 Fig. 125 very long (8m) dromos excavated in 1990 and the blocked entrance comprised large stones at the bottom, smaller at the top but randomly placed. The tomb is LM IIIA but was re-used in C times since the necropolis of the C city was in the same area. The area was used as a dumping place for refuse at a later date. Apart from LM IIIA:2 pottery, including a champagne cup and piriform stirrup-jar (ADelt P1.159y), the other finds were 4th Ct BC. In Odos Giampoudaki, close to a large HL tomb, five tile-covered pit-graves were found-orientation N-S. They are dated to the 4th Ct BC and were found in a trench dug for a sewage system. Odos Antoniou Yiannari also had a trench in the road which yielded a cist grave 2.40 by 1.00m. Lekythoi are reported but the precise date is unknown. (ADelt 410-12) Drapania, cemetery of Agios Dimitrios. In 1983-84, S of Nopigeia and close to the National Road, at Skoutenas, a large deposit of LM IA pottery was found-mostly conical cups-in a trench 20m long; a ritual character is suggested. In 1984, 180 vases were found in sector I-1, again almost all conical cups, in a small trench 0.40 by 0.60m, 1.10m deep; 80 vases came from sector 1-26 and 78 from sector 1-27-almost all conical cups. (ADelt 414-15) Kastelli Kisamou: Excavation at the Health Centre in Kastelli continued. As one of the mosaics (from room 3) depicting masks and medallions was subsiding it was decided to lift it, providing the opportunity to excavate underneath the mosaic (Fig. 126). The bedding of the mosaic was examined and it was found to consist of several layers of loose shingle as well as a shingle and mortar bedding. When the ground underneath was excavated it was expected that there would be the continuation of the same building that was found underneath the mosaic of room 1. However, directly underneath the bedding layer there was evidence for an earlier, somewhat inferior house. This had a floor of crushed earth and Fig. 126</page><page sequence="122">122 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 127 red brick, and amphora fragments were found scattered around. There was also a threshold found in exactly the same place, although narrower than the later threshold. It is now certain that room 3 area 1 is the oldest of all the rooms in the complex with a date some time after the 1st Ct AD. (ADelt 415) During works carried out on the drainage system in the town of Kastelli an area of anc. remains was noticed in the W part of the works on the main Kastelli road. An excavation was carried out. In area 1 just below the visible surface an area was cleared of a construction of unequal paved stones (measuring 1.20-1.70 x 0.60-0.90m: Fig. 127). This was running in the direction NE-SW for a length of 14m and with a width of 3m. In the slabs there were shallow grooves which must result from the continuous traffic of wheeled vehicles. This gives an indication that this was a main route through the anc. town. In an area around 50m from here an excavation in 1979 revealed part of a paved road measuring 4.80 x 8.40m running in the direction NW-SE. (ADelt 34, 396-7). Because of the great similarities between the roads it is suggested that the two roads belong to the same road system and that there is a cross-road. All along the length of the road remains of houses were found. In the S most were built of unworked stone and cement, whereas in the N the majority were made from worked stone. It seems that the road was in use between the 2nd and the 3rd Cts AD. Dating from an earlier period were houses uncovered to the E, constructed of worked and unworked stone with floors of beaten earth. In area 2 there were walls made from unworked stone and cement. There was also a well which was circular on the outside and square on the inside, and measured 0.60 x 0.60m. The chronology of the pottery would suggest a date of use between the 2nd and 4th Cts AD. Two architectural fragments were also discovered. In the E of area 2, a set of auxiliary rooms, probably belonging to a small private bathhouse, was discovered. The pottery suggests a date of 2nd to 3rd Ct AD. The destruction of this seems to be at the same time as the cutting was being made for the road. In the same area 2 was found a road quite similar to that of area 1. (ADelt 415-16) Farangitakis plot: excavation of a site in the middle of the R centre of Kisamos was carried out between 1989 and 1991. In the NE of the area they discovered rooms of a building with tiled floors and walls of worked stone. There seem to have been two similar phases with a final destruction in the 4th Ct AD. The walls of the best preserved room (room 1) in the NE had a floor of marble and stone slabs. NE of the wall was a doorway which led into the second room which was not completely excavated. There were benches along the inside of the W wall. A third room was paved with marble slabs. Some of the walls were preserved to a height of 2.20m and in some cases there was evidence for re-use of two walls in the 2nd phase. In the area of rooms 4 and 5 there were openings for doors. In the SW part of the room 4 there was evidence of two steps leading up to second level. Two of the walls define an open space which may have been a small private bath belonging to the domestic complex. More walls were discovered to the N and in this area room 6 was brought to light. The walls of worked stone were well preserved (to a height of 3.60m in places). There was a floor of stone slabs and there were benches lining the walls. In the N area pipes and walls were discovered and in the bottom of one of the trenches there was also evidence of a large refuse ditch. Some walls in this area were worked and some unworked. Among the finds were bronze objects, many bronze coins, bone needles and pins, and a lot of fine as well as coarse pottery; also a marble head of a statue of Aphrodite. These finds date the area to the 2nd Ct AD. The excavation of the building should be useful for the study of the architecture of anc. Kisamos as it is the first time that walls to such a great height have been revealed. (ADelt 419) Vestakis Plot. Excavations began in 1988 and a very large area was uncovered. There were seven rooms, two of which had evidence for mosaic floors and marble slabs. Most of the walls were of large stones (Fig. 128). Room 1 was situated on the S side of the house. The walls here were preserved to a height of 0.89m. There were traces of white, yellow and red paint on the stones of the N wall. The floor was made from hard crushed earth with a layer of white mortar underneath it. Room 2 measured 7.10 x 6.49m. In the S part of the room there was a white band of mosaic floor preserved measuring 0.56 x 6.15m (Fig. 129). This was made from large white stones and there was a thin layer of mortar underneath it. In the centre of the marble floor there was an octagon. A variety of colours was used in the marble floor and there were bands of white marble separating the floor into different panels. Room 3 had the same dimensions as room 2 and the floor was covered with mosaic. There was also a second area of floor decoration in the room and that consisted of an area of stamped marble tiles. The bedding of the mosaic was clearly visible in room 3. Four other rooms were excavated. The pottery finds were few, but date the building to the 3rd Ct AD. The large number of marble slabs in room 2 would suggest that the building had been abandoned before its destruction. Although there were not enough clues to suggest the function of the building, by the nature of the floors and architecture it would seem that the building was very rich and that it may have been a wealthy villa or farmhouse. (ADelt 422-6) Modi Kydonias. During works carried out by ABEA on the mound of Ayios Gerasimos in the area of Modi some pithos burials were brought to light on the SE part of the hill. The burials were oriented W to E. Part of the cemetery had already been destroyed by the road. There was cord decoration around the pithoi. Outside the graves bits of broken bone and small pots were discovered. (ADelt 412) Nopigeia, Kisamos. The extension of the National Road between Kolymvari and Kastelli was altered northwards so that this important PR and historic site (probably anc. Methymna) was not destroyed. In 1983 and 1984, 109 test trenches were with architectural remains of EM, MM, LM I, LM III as well</page><page sequence="123">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 123 as C, HL, R and ECh. In 1990 and 1991, three trenches were opened (A-F) with the following results: Trench A, due S of the National Road, produced one particularly strong wall which may be connected with coastal barriers; an area with beach pebbles could indicate where the anc. coast lay. Trench B (1990/91) produced a limestone wall above a layer of pebbles. The lowest level was EM-MM I, with a MM III layer above, followed by mixed M and HL. Stereo was found at 1.20m beneath the surface. MM III and HL pottery were found in Trench F along with the corer of a building (ADelt 412-14). Sphakia, Eparchy of. At the place called Agios Nikolaos in the National Forest of Samaria an excavation was carried out on a rural shrine. It seems to have been used for a significant length of time, from the 6th Ct BC to the R period, although the majority of offerings would seem to date from the 1st to the 3rd Ct AD (Fig. 130, 131: iron spearheads and lamp). There was a hollow in the rock in the S part of the area and it is here that the majority of the offerings were left. Towards the W there was also a cave which appears to have been considered sacred. In it there was a circular construction and _3^^ L _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ II _ _ _ _ _ L - - - - - - - - - Fig. 128 I I I I I</page><page sequence="124">124 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 129 Fig. 131 ......... . ....... Fig. 132 near to the rock there was an ash deposit with scatterings of animal bones and votives. There are indications that the deity worshipped was Artemis Britomartis or Apollo. (ADelt 426) Stavromenos Chamalevriou. Excavations continued at the Daphnomilis plot, concentrated in the N part of the bathhouse. The excavations of room 3 (the caldarium) showed that there were successive phases. In the removal of the upper level bones, domestic pots (including amphoras, basins, pegs, pithoi and other domestic material) were discovered and there was also a beaten earth floor. Under this were groups of piled brick, some of which showed traces of burning. These were generally preserved to a height of 0.43-0.76m (Fig. 132). In the S of room 3 the praefumium was discovered. The area was cut out of the rock and the walls were made from unworked stone. The floor was also rock-cut. In the W part there was a bench around the walls which had measured 0.65 x 0.50m. The latest use of the bathhouse seems to have been in the 5th Ct AD. The finds included whole cooking pots, some Fig. 130</page><page sequence="125">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1996-97 125 local, and stone imports, and there was also a number of bones. The excavation of room 4, W of Room 3, turned up another caldarium and a tepidarium with a diameter of 5.50 x 2.70m. Part of the room was rock-cut and part of it was built from large stones. There was also a second praefumium. In the area around a group of uncharacteristic ceramics was collected.
