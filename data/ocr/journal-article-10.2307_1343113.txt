<plain_text><page sequence="1">Coppola's Conrad: The Repetitions of Complicity Garrett Stewart It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares. -Marlow in Heart of Darkness It smelled like death in there, malaria, nightmares.... This was the end of the river all right. -Willard in Apocalypse Now Francis Ford Coppola's film Apocalypse Now takes up Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1898) as an aesthetic repetition within a human history of repetition, a returning nightmare of plunder, blunder, and malignity as old as the motives of empire. Heart of Darkness does not come easily to Apocalypse Now, yet the film's real power derives from its sustained attempt to transpose the story's incremental repetitions of style, plot, and psychology into a new cinematic register and a new century. Film stands to tale as the brutal duplications within each stand to one another: signaling a replication beyond either or any text, an irreversible cyclic violence that threatens to turn history itself into one long sacrificial ritual. Conrad's politics thus predict rather than merely provide the heart of Coppola's darkness, Apocalypse Now emerging as both historical deduc- tion and aesthetic debt. Film not only overhauls or reinhabits but ex- trapolates from a piece of classic fiction. The result, for all its extravagant lapses, is an American movie of risk, scope, extraordinary impact, and rare challenge.

Would the trouble most everyone notices toward the end of Apocalypse Now therefore have to do with the fact that Conrad is too good for Coppola's own good? (Certainly in estimates to date the book is seldom set against the film without being used against it.) Or is there a problem in Conrad's own ending for Heart of Darkness which Coppola tries to face up to and work through, not routinely borrowing his source so much as recapitulating it in yet a bleaker key? Coppola is trying to address by spectacle the dilemmas of moral complicity that Conrad ma- nipulates by tone and metaphor, trying to find in visual chiaroscuro and collage the equivalent of the writer's brooding, rhetorical cadences and driven iterations. The film he builds in this way, spellbound (or thun- derstruck) at times by its own reverberations, still burrows as Conrad does down to the shadowed underside of event, even in its troubled and cumbersome finish. This final phase of the story, with Kurtz at last con- fronted, offers perhaps the best place to measure the angle of Coppola's deflection from Conrad and so to assess the dimensions of his film as a whole. Departing from Conrad, Coppola gains access to their common theme at a deep level. The revisionary impulse becomes, as it sounds, a second look, harder, darker. To see what befalls and refashions Kurtz on his way from book to film, where Marlon Brando's version of him can too easily seem redun- dant, is to see something of the internal workings of narrative, its genius for repetition, multiplication, and mirroring, and its itch for the round- ing out of a narrative line, the spatialization of temporal form. Conrad's Marlow recounts a narrative of infectious evil which there is every reason to suppose he has told before and will tell again, a story inexhaustible, never exorcized, the oldest story of all: the truth about human nature that links in one unbroken narrative the corrupting power of Roman colonization and the imperialistic pride of Victorian England. Coppola extends this historical line forward into American militarism. As atroc- ities in his film repeat and compound themselves and psyches duplicate and fuse, Coppola presses his symbolism a step beyond Conrad, turning the screw of cyclic history and spiral plotting one more notch into violent confrontation-not only between national armies but between separate entities innately bonded, between antihero and villain, executioner and Antichrist. Two influential recent critics, J. Hillis Miller and Rene Girard, com- ing at the question of repetition so separately as never to repeat each Garrett Stewart, professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author of Dickens and the Trials of Imagination.

A few years back in these pages, Miller argued that it was the nature of every major narrative line to trace itself by some return or repetition, looping over its own length, crisscrossing, knotting up.1 Which zigzags, folds, and intersections are definitive for Apocalypse Now? What Girard says about the structure of sacrifice should also bear on a movie that ends in a bloody scapegoat ritual where the tense thread of plot is split into parallel symbolic strands by a crosscutting of the cinematic line. Incision yields doubling, psychological exchange, violent equivalence. In the rudimentary forms of tragedy, Girard explains, "vio- lence invariably effaces the difference between the antagonists," for it is "the act of reprisal, the repetition of imitative acts of violence, that characterizes tragic plotting."2 Coppola further suggests that when the violent reprisal is of self against alter ego, in a repetition of previous violence committed in the first person, the logic of repetition is compli- cated by the power of two. The "line" Willard must get on Kurtz is the plot line of his own examined story drawn to the breaking point. In both Conrad and Coppola, a river journey offers from the first a linear figure (doubled in Conrad, where the story of the Congo passage is told on the Thames) for the steering of their plots along what Marlow calls "streams of death in life." The briefest summary should sketch a map. Conrad sends his narrator Marlow, agent of an international trad- ing company, up the Congo River in search of another European agent in the ivory trade named Kurtz, a once humanistic mastermind of in- ordinate personal energy and intelligence, whose burning idealism, but not his hubris, has been lost to festering empathy with the jungle where he has been installed, it seems, as a kind of ruthless godhead among cannibals. Rumors of Kurtz's genius and eloquence begin to preoccupy Marlow as he nears his destination, but by the time Marlow reaches him, Kurtz is feverish, skeletal, and doomed. Kurtz dies shortly afterward with Marlow in nearby attendance, Kurtz's eloquence dwindled to that 1. J. Hillis Miller, "Ariadne's Thread: Repetition and the Narrative Line," Critical Inquiry 3 (Autumn 1976): 57-77. The deliberately embedded image of a thread as analogue for any story as yarn is apparent in Conrad not only with the map Marlow studies before his setting out, of the sinuous Congo River as linear synecdoche for the trek and track of coming narration, but with that "uncanny and fateful" old woman in the company's office whose act of "knitting black wool as for a warm pall" marks the point of departure for Marlow in his journey from civilization to the jungle. Symbol of plot as fate, her work draws and fastens into pattern-into a premonition and a destiny-the originating thread of a symbolic quest narrative that recognizes itself as a complex reticulation of advances and returns, a webwork of inevitable doubling. 2.

The horror!" Allegorically charted, the story's true voyage of discovery, together with its true point of no return, is the gradual convergence of Marlow's imagination with the dark churnings of Kurtz's heart. To borrow from another Conrad title, Marlow must come to admit himself as a "secret sharer" in Kurtz's vile will to power, must come face to face with his gruesome double across the very brink of the grave. In the film script by Coppola and John Milius, Brando plays Kurtz, now a brilliant Green Beret colonel, as swollen rather than emaciated by evil, a man gradually maddened by the Indochina conflict who has retreated into the Cambodian jungle to play out in the guise of a demonic Buddha his vision of terrorizing and remorseless warfare. There he has divested himself of his uniform and been lifted to rule over a tribe of whitewashed, spectral natives who seem to travesty the pale Anglo villain come among them. Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard (Coppola's ver- sion of Marlow), the steely-willed classified agent sent upriver by the Intelligence Corps to slay Kurtz before it is too late. The symbolic stream that runs straight from Conrad's African river through. the turbulent flood of Coppola's apocalyptic imagery is implied early on by Willard's reference to a main circuit. His metaphor, a technological conceit that modernizes a linear metaphor in Conrad, suggests the quest plot circling round to self-confrontation. Marlow repeatedly describes the inauspi- cious river as a twisted snake, suggesting an Edenic promise corrupted by serpentine and sinister trade routes. In the gritty vernacular of the Apocalypse narration, written after the original script by Michael Herr (author of the Vietnam journal Dispatches), Willard says of the fatal river, as if it were the visual delineation of the movie's whole plot, that it "snaked through the war like a main-circuit cable plugged directly into Kurtz." The two men are thus stationed at different points along the same systematic malfunction, a chain of command overloaded by stupid brutalities and constantly in danger of an explosive short circuit. By the standards of screen borrowings, a surprisingly high per- centage of Conrad is there in Coppola, imported but transmuted. Mar- low's black helmsman reappears as Chief, the pilot of Willard's craft who tells him of his immediate predecessor on the river, an officer who has mysteriously committed suicide in a fatal omen of self-confrontation. Willard, like Marlow, fixates on Kurtz's voice long before he is encoun- tered, a voice that "put a hook" in Willard ever since he heard a tape recording of the colonel's psychotic fantasies and genocidal ravings. Con- rad's Russian in motley, stupefied by admiration for Kurtz, is a role inherited by Dennis Hopper as a loony photojournalist, devoted fool to Kurtz's mad lord. Such proliferating details from Conrad pace and focus Coppola's wartime narrative down to its finale in private violence, where the line "exterminate all the brutes!" scribbled on Kurtz's supposed hu- manistic report on methods for civilizing the natives is transposed into</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 459 a nuclear key as "Drop the bomb! Exterminate them all!" And through both plots, seductive and bedevilling, runs that almost hallucinatory magnetism Kurtz exercises over the protagonist's imagination, a dark linkage that gives the true psychic axis to the gloom and gore of story. In one of the head-on ironies of Conrad's narration, Marlow dis- claims his own integral part in the tale as another European soul strug- gling with guilt at least by association: "I don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally," he would have us believe, yet he admits as an afterthought that the eventual meeting with Kurtz did seem "somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me-and into my thoughts," invoking there an apt play on "about" as "around" but also "concerning." Atmosphere is spiritual comment in the story, but Coppola's Willard is more to the point. "There's no way to tell Kurtz's story without telling my own," he announces toward the start of the film, "and if his story is really a confession, then so is mine." The plot's deepest logic is a rhythm before it is an argument. Paired, split, and parallel syntax, antithetical or double-tracked cadences, all give the seal of dead- lock or the pull of contradiction to the pace of voice-over narrative even before it has accumulated to theme. "They call me an assassin," says Kurtz's voice on the tape Willard first hears. "What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?" It is a rhetorical question meant only to instill its ironic and repetitive rhythm until such circular hypocrisy can be explored by actual drama. Apart from the clear parallels between Conrad's story and Coppola's script, two salient divergences, one in framing structure, one in climactic plot, go far toward gauging the thematic differences between these two versions of the tale. Coppola has dropped the coda in which Willard returns to Kurtz's once humanizing and domestic connections (fiancee in the story, wife and son in the film) to deliver a sugar-coated fabrication of Kurtz's terrible end, a lie that (however speciously well-intentioned) binds Marlow, in the tale, to the worst delusions of hubris, blind idealism, and intellectual superiority. Coppola's dismantling such a structure of receding irony provides a cinematically more forceful, if at one level ethically simplified, narrative: Willard's collusion in the brutal heart of Kurtz's darkness speaks for itself-or whispers pitilessly on the closing sound track with "The horror! The horror!" Willard's moral complicity does not need a white lie shading to black to confirm it because his deepest guilt and identification with Kurtz inform Coppola's most ob- vious departure of all from Conrad: the fact that Willard does not, as Marlow before him, simply watch Kurtz die but becomes his bloody executioner. The circular trap by which savagery must be performed in order to purge itself entangles Willard in a tragic repetition of Kurtz's own tactics of fiendish expediency that implicates in the prevailing bloodshed the very agent come to exorcize it. Conrad's turn-of-the-century critique</page><page sequence="6">460 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad of amoral imperialism and the sins of pride to which it falls prey is not lazily appropriated, compromised, or updated by Coppola. Rather, he rigorously projects it into its own augured future, exposing idealistic colonialism's inevitable violent issue in capitalist military aggression. By being at times so infernally faithful in drawing on the prehistoric jungle imagery of his source, Coppola may seem to have surrendered his chances to mount a definitively contemporary war epic. Yet the lurid primeval atmosphere of the movie's climax, if dramatically miscalculated, appears far less anachronistic, exotic, and derivative when proper weight is given to the episode Coppola invents which has no parallel in Conrad at all and which doubles his plotline's power to move toward a conclusion. The swaggering, psychotic Colonel Kilgore, in the thick of his mad com- mand, serves as a preliminary exposure to evil, anticipating his more profound counterpart in Kurtz. Kilgore (the compound pun of his name a double indictment straight out of the satiric techniques of Catch-22) strafes, bombs, and napalms an entire enemy village mainly to clear a beachhead for surfing. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his men descend out of the skies like winged supernatural furies, piping Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" through loudspeakers mounted on their helicopters (the colonel's inscribed with the apocalyptic motto "Death from Above"), in a perversion of art even more nefarious than the use of Beethoven as an emetic in Stanley Ku- brick's A Clockwork Orange. But it is Kurtz's own unfolding history which finally clarifies the imagery of satanic descent in the helicopter mission. His demonic proficiency has also, we learn from his dossier, taken the form of death from above: we discover with Willard that Kurtz rose to national prominence, and a Newsweek cover story, by spearheading an unauthorized air strike with the code name "Archangel." As Willard says about the whole matter, "The bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam you needed wings to stay above it." When the wings turn malign, the Arch- angel is confessed as Lucifer, who must be struck down by a central command whose code name in the last scenes, broadcast repeatedly over the ship's intercom, is "Almighty." This religious imagery is not idly strewn about but built up from episode to episode. When we first en- counter Kilgore in a cleanup operation, there are shots of a priest shout- ing mass to genuflecting soldiers in the middle of the still chaotic bat- tleground, while above the offered Eucharist the netted body of an ironically sacred cow is being helicoptered out of the fray-an image that anticipates the slaughter of the sacrificial beast at the film's conclu- sion. Just before the encounter with Kurtz, Willard's crew must pass through the deserted scene of a satanic sabbath, altars heaped with severed heads and flanked by votive torches guttering amid a forest of charred, ashen crucifixes. Such cumulative repetitions of religious im- agery are not incremental so much as regressive, moving back beyond</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 461 the Christian myth, defunct and desecrated, to more primitive com- munions and sacrifices. Apocalypse Now certainly keeps its title before us with its imagery of fallen archangels, Antichrists, satanic auras and emanations, and fiendish halos. The Intelligence Corps general who assigns Willard to his top- secret mission says that Kurtz is one of those men whose dark sides have usurped the "better angels of our nature," and Kilgore is introduced into Coppola's plot to illustrate an aggravated but not yet final stage in this corruption, a willful and foolish cruelty still held in check by the trappings of command. He is, says Willard, a soldier "with a weird kind of light around him"--a braggart's hellfire made literal in Kilgore's case-which signals the fact that he would never get so much as a scratch in battle. In the last dossier photograph of Kurtz Willard studies (taken in Cambodia by the Hopper character?), Kurtz too, backlit, seems to radiate such a glow but is himself all in shade, a black silhouette rimmed with fire. This photograph, like a spiritual X-ray, anticipates with its hellish aureole the man's actual appearance at the end, Kurtz no more than a brooding and tortured bulk emerging from darkness, catching the light only dimly, as if he barely remains in the phenomenal world at all-a ghostly presence that outlines the abstract form of his doom as the embodied core of darkness. The absurd homicidal spectacle of Kilgore's methods suggests to Willard that it could not be "just insanity and murder" that headquarters holds against Kurtz, for "there was enough of that to go around." Instinct tells Willard that as he moves from this colonel to the other (the viewer moving with him), the sequential encounter with brutality will not be redundant but will plumb corruption to a new depth. What singles out Kurtz for extermination is not the scale of his slaughter but the exco- riating self-knowledge (up to a point, beyond which Willard is necessary) and fevered independence that fuel his brutality and carry it beyond the reach of containment or subordination by his military superiors. To discover this about Kurtz, however, Willard must confront himself even more deeply, must respond in kind, as we will see, to Kurtz's self-aware- ness-answer to it and indeed complete it as he turns the other's suicidal instinct into murder, turns Kurtz's craving for a way out into an exit by execution. It is a sentence Willard carries out against himself as well, for in killing Kurtz he will not only answer the colonel's introductory ques- tion-"Are you an assassin?"-but own up to it for the second time. One of the. finer ironies of Coppola's story is that the official reason for terminating Kurtz includes his having summarily executed a number of double agents without permission from central command, yet such as- sassination is precisely Willard's credential for his mission against Kurtz in the first place. As the film opens, we discover our narrator raving drunk in Saigon, in a grueling lull between assignments, wondering how</page><page sequence="8">462 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad many men he has killed by this point and waiting for yet another mission to be allotted to him "for my sins"-a penance, an expiation in more blood. It is a perfect irony that he first assumes he is being arrested rather than assigned a new duty and asks, "What are the charges?" Willard is interviewed in the next scene by the Intelligence staff, and we find that his last assignment was in fact the assassination of a tax collector. When Willard's voice later breaks onto the sound track reading a letter from Kurtz to his son about being accused of murder by the army, Willard's own "I" seems to take upon himself the burden of defense. Whereas in Conrad, Marlow does nothing wrong, Willard meets Kurtz on equal terms, mutual even when they turn punitive. His new "charge" is indeed an accusation after all. Though Willard's previous acts of murder are only alluded to, two subsequently staged events spell out the violence in which his psyche is mired. When his trigger-happy crew massacres a sampan full of innocent Vietnamese only to discover one woman still alive, they want to rush her to medical attention. Knowing that this would endanger his mission, Willard cold-bloodedly kills the woman with a single bullet. In the im- mediately preceding scene, Willard has read a letter from Kurtz about ruthlessness in combat as a kind of clarity in which one does "what there is to be done, awake, looking at it," without being rendered impotent by the "timid lying morality" of official codes of conduct. As if taking dic- tation from Kurtz's words, Willard acts directly in line with their fearful insight. After a long-held shot of him isolated on the prow of the ship, bulking to a silhouette edged by the wasted light of the setting sun (much like Kurtz's photograph in the preceding scene), the screen goes dark, blank, for a disconcerting (and in this film unprecedented) stretch-no slow and decisive cut but more like a wound in narrative. We have here, for a full half-minute, the visual equivalent of the heart of darkness, the instinct toward cool, callous, efficient action bluntly confronting itself within a gulf of voided narrative, voided nature. When images begin to emerge, resolving back into light and focus, Willard's resumed voice- over (in what would ordinarily be part of the same continuous scene) acknowledges that, although the crew will never look at him the same again, he has in a single act of violence learned "one or two things about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier"-by learning, of course, more about himself as one of the two men. This brief hole in linear narrative is a small masterstroke of editing and editorializing at once. The pitch-black hiatus at this turning point opens our eyes with Willard's to the plot's own abyss, a fracture at one level of the story that drops its hero through to a closer bond than ever with Kurtz as an alter ego in calculated ferocity. Such a lacuna in narrative is a breach in telling that reaches out, for it opens us to our own space of contemplation as well as to Willard's. I am obviously verging here on a cinematic correlative to that reader- response criticism so much in vogue of late for literary studies. An even</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 463 more direct example of this in Apocalypse Now comes early with the film's one explicit allusion to the metaphor in Conrad's title. When Willard is getting his orders over lunch with the general, he looks straight into our eyes (the eye of the camera) as the general mentions the phrase "dark side of our natures." Willard's gaze snares all of us, too, in the complicity he must so relentlessly share with Kurtz. A later violation of the cinematic frame also challenges our supposedly safe distance from the confines of plot. After a machine-gun assault from the invisible enemy on shore, the ship's black navigator, staring straight into the camera, reaches below and past the frame, as if into our own laps, and brings back his fist bloodied with the gore of the other black seaman on the boat, just gunned down. These two men thus become blood brothers in the most sicken- ingly literal sense. At the same time, by a camera angle that can only be described as a corpse's-eye view, we are drawn into a drama of mortal soul mating in a cinematically unorthodox way. Our point of view dem- onstrates, visually and viscerally at once, how in such nationally sanc- tioned carnage the soldier always dies for us, in our very place and space-we are our dead-and how, too, in all art death can be turned (as it will be again in the case of Kurtz at the end) into an act of sacrificial surrogacy, the participant as scapegoat for the spectator. The tragic bonding of these two black men at the point of death is reversed for the chief's own fatality shortly afterward, the second scene of violence that helps mark the change from Marlow to Willard. The navigator's character, as I mentioned above, is modelled loosely on the helmsman in Heart of Darkness, an illiterate black pilot who steers Marlow toward his destination until speared to death in a jungle attack. In Con- rad the helmsman seems to stand for physical instrumentality abstracted from any reflective capacity, brawn to Marlow's brain, and so to form with him a composite and complete human agent, each half of which recognizes his deep link to the other only at the "supreme moment" of death. Coppola stays as close to the original dichotomy of this conception as he can. Of course his chief speaks English, being an American soldier, but when asked his opinion for the first time by Willard, the chief replies flatly, bitterly, "I don't think," leaving the decisions entirely to the clear- sighted but compunctionless Willard. When the chief is stabbed in the back by a spear, he tries to embrace Willard not as he did his slain black brother but in an unexpected attempt to yank his superior officer down upon the spear's point as it protrudes from above his heart. Conrad's deployment of mortality as the supreme test of human brotherhood is converted in the film to the reprisal of an enraged death grip, white and black man face to face across the narrowed breathing space of their interdependence and their enmity. When Willard has to administer, in effect, the death blow to the chief in order to preserve his own life, we see again that heightening of violence over the Conrad original that leads to the even more fatal doubling of Willard and Kurtz at the river's</page><page sequence="10">464 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad end. Willard has informed us early in his narrative that, while he has killed many enemy soldiers at close enough range to feel their dying breaths, the attack on Kurtz, his military superior, would be different. On his way to this fateful confrontation, Willard feels the death breath of a soldier under his command (speared by what Willard claimed were only toy arrows), as if he were struggling with an enemy in mortal combat and must look into the face of his own murderousness as a symbolic negative image of his responsibility as an officer. "A part of myself," notes Willard, is afraid of what that "I" will do upon meeting Kurtz, and it is that part of himself (though he doesn't yet guess this) which is Kurtz, or which dwells with him in the dark recesses of the will. Orson Welles had just the right idea: on first coming to Hollywood, before conceiving the Citizen Kane project, he had in- tended to film Heart of Darkness with himself playing both Marlow and Kurtz. Trying to explain why Kurtz transferred to a Green Beret air- borne unit, Willard says, "He could have gone for general; he went for himself instead." That second phrase can be taken in the idiomatic sense of an assault on the self, worded differently later when Willard suspects that Kurtz not only broke with his family (as Willard has agreed to a divorce from his wife) but "broke with himself." Violence for the reflective soul is always in the long run reflexive, self-divisive, a rending of identity. Kurtz has split, that is, into both Willard and himself together, cold- blooded clarity of purpose and the more bestial promptings into which it can degenerate, and so he knows, says Willard, "more about what I am going to do than I do myself." Again the cadences of parallelism and antithesis accompany the reflexive syntax of splintered identity. When Willard first describes Kurtz in his temple, he says he has never seen a man so "ripped in half," and this helps explain the alternating dialogue of their first dramatic encounter, verging as it does on the echoing stich- omythia of ritual tragedy: "Are you an assassin?" "I'm a soldier." "You're neither. You're an errand boy." Disjunctions, wavering rapidly enough, fuse into equivalence. At the same time, certain imagistic repetitions momentarily double back past their own debasement to an unfallen purity. "This was the end of the river all right," remarks Willard when he first enters Kurtz's com- pound. Unfortunately, the only arresting speech he encounters there, the only one truly suited to Brando's gift for bizarre yet delicate eccen- tricity, is Kurtz's halting, pained nostalgia for the undespoiled land of home. In a Huck Finn-ish evocation, he searches for words to recall a gardenia plantation along the Ohio River he knew as a boy, where it seemed several miles of heaven had fallen on the earth. Now all the skies</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 465 have fallen, and hell has erupted onto the face of a defiled earth. "Did you live near the river?" Kurtz begins by asking his fellow middle-Amer- ican from Ohio. No matter, he responds, all rivers lead here. The pastoral has gone purgatorial. "In the destructive element immerse [yourself]," commands Conrad in Lord Jim, and some such idea, a baptism in the primal, must underlie one of the most peculiar scenes in Apocalypse Now. For his fated last audience with Kurtz, Willard chooses, for some undermotivated and thus presumably symbolic reason, and although far readier access is available, to enter the virtual throneroom of Kurtz's Cambodian temple by way of a complete submergence in the river's backwash that abuts on the portals of the fortress (fig. 1). This scene also recalls Willard's first trespass onto Kurtz's terrain, where moral disorientation and debase- mom.

Wil- lard's later and last approach to the temple becomes an amphibious ambush, as he surfaces from the muddied waters of precivilized life. And when he emerges, he too is painted like a savage in that brand of pagan war paint which is modern military camouflage, the same livid disguise that Kurtz wore on his very last military mission when he de- capitated one of his own nation's soldiers aboard Willard's boat. Such camouflage is a would-be subterfuge turned ironically to spiritual un- masking, the lethal truth spelled out in the perverse colors of its own primitive reversion. Rising smeared with paint and mud, as if for the ritualized murder of some crazed Caesar, Willard hacks Kurtz to pieces with a machete. The grotesque spectacle is a Black Mass of sacrificial vengeance, staged in operatic counterpoint to the natives' ceremonial butchering of an animal outside, recalling the dire ironies of conjunction between cathedral baptism or religious street procession, respectively, and the various vendetta murders in Coppola's Godfather films. This twofold blood sacrifice as purging retribution also recalls Kurtz's re- corded voice earlier, announcing his intention to exterminate the enemy "pig by pig, cow by cow." As he would slay, so he is laid low. Added to this, and complicating the whole pageant of atrocity and contrition, is the deadly reflexive logic of Willard's sacerdotal slaughter, performed in the painted mantle of primitive rites doubling as the guise of modern warfare. By an inescapable irony, this mission for his sins becomes Wil- lard's ultimate collusion in brutality as well as his ceremonial cleansing (fig. 2). Like a dying and rising god, his private hell harrowed and fled, Willard, after a few moments alone with Kurtz in the reciprocal precincts of damnation, steps beyond the entombing death chamber into the native throng. He is suddenly bowed down to as the new lord, his lower impulses forced now to contend with the lure of their own deification. This is just where one rough cut initially screened for preview audiences ambigu- ously ended, with the unsettling sense that Willard might, depraved by power, take up where Kurtz left off. Such a closure seemed to complete the prognosis of the scene in which the general initially orders Kurtz's death, musing that "out there with those natives it must be a temptation to play God." Instead, in the finished version, Willard's purging murder accomplished and his soul's greater doom-dark incarnation as a god- head-avoided, he throws down his bloodstained weapon and returns homeward with his own kind. The drugged and deranged young soldier Lance, the sole member of the crew to make it alive, having preserved his life, it would seem, only by being detached from his sanity, is retrieved by Willard from the barbarity in which he has so passively taken part, first at war and now in pagan ritual.

The movie is ready to close-close round-upon its opening image, Willard's head superimposed, in a sub- jective or hallucinatory framing, alongside an equally scaled close-up of the stone idol recently beside him at the temple door, an image eyeless, impassive, dead, but seeming to whisper now from its own cold lips the repeated "horror" of Kurtz's last words. Coppola has resisted most or- dinary temptations to blend the human images of Willard and Kurtz in any melodramatic visual equation, whether by intercutting craftily be- tween them or superimposing one upon the other. Instead he has re- ferred them both back to the blasphemous stone image, idolatrous and blind. The prophetic icon of their blurred fates, it fades out in the movie's last evaporating shot. But to what resolution does this dissolve? Through what variation on the themes of its source does this ending do its work? One of the major surprises of Apocalypse Now is that the movie does not address Vietnam in overt political terms. Conrad's largest political irony em- braced and satirized the whole of Western colonial idealism. As he had Marlow blandly declare, even after the terrible revelations both embod- ied and voiced by Kurtz: The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea-something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to.... With ideas like that, what need of delusions? Yet it is dangerously easy to take this as Conrad's own redemptive point, mouthed by his narrative stand-in, just as there is no little risk in Apocalypse Now of taking Kurtz's amoral futilism about the darkness in all men as a complacently ac- knowledged inevitability. Yet Willard is there to rebuke and cure, even as he corroborates, this levelling vision. Where Marlow half-admires the original Kurtz straight to the end, Willard must murder him. Coppola's protagonist is more jaded than Marlow even before he has heard Kurtz's name, more embroiled in a carnage that may have begun as foreign but has grown only too familiar. The psychological trajectory of the film thus takes the curve, the moral downswerve, of the source story and continues it further into incriminating recognition. Conrad's epoch of colonization, with the idealism, hypocrisy, and greed that spawned it and the delusions of European moral grandeur that ennobled its rhetoric, has atrophied in Coppola's film beyond mere political expediency to urges so violent and atavistic that they have left articulation itself behind. No one in the film thinks even to allude to reasons for being involved in the Vietnamese</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 469 War, and this is not Coppola's fault but the fault of the military action itself, the barbarism of which is after a point self-generating as well as, so his ending would suggest, self-revenging. Kurtz may once, before volunteering for the Green Berets, have had the intellectual compulsion to rationalize his nation's political role in Indochina, but rapidly obsessed by the means of brutality, he has long since lost interest in any end but his own. By the time we meet him, Kurtz wants to die. He knows right away that Willard is the man for the job, but he must train him to his black task by torture and disclosure at once. Where Conrad's Marlow was a minor satellite of Kurtz's tragedy, Willard and the new Kurtz are bound up in a deadly symbiosis. Coppola's Kurtz knows his own evil to some degree and waits for the man who will know himself well enough in Kurtz to will the eradication of that self, someone in no position to 'judge" him, who will permit him to die a "soldier's death" even at the hands of one of his own, just as he has killed the last GI on Willard's boat. It takes an assassin to slay one, as Kurtz intuited when first asking his visitor if he fit the description. By answering in deed rather than word, Willard seems once again, as in the sampan scene, to be acting under indirect orders from Kurtz, who recognizes with colder clarity than ever "what there is to be done." Private and public renunciation merge again in another of Willard's parallel constructions: "Everyone wanted him dead, himself most of all." Looking up knowingly as the blade descends, Kurtz has finally found an antagonist whose reciprocation of wicked instinct enacts on a private scale the internecine nature of the whole war. The martial epic has shrunk to a revenger's tragedy with a cast of one. Complex moral narratives like Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now are likely to twist back over themselves in order to find an exit from the ethical labyrinth of their own intricacy, to fit their length to a finish. We need Coppola's Kurtz precisely because we have seen him in other shapes before. Ariadne's thread (Miller's term) can only strengthen itself by doubling up. Kurtz is Kilgore understood from within; Kurtz is Willard in the act of understanding. And these understandings complement the archetypal structure of the conclusion. Ritual is psychologized; public bloodbath is the opening of an inner vein of meaning. It is no accident thit Girard's remarks about the brutal duplications of ritual sacrifice and surrogacy turn out repeatedly to be statements about repetition. "In a tragedy the reciprocal relationship between the characters is real, but it is the sum of nonreciprocal moments. The antagonists never occupy the same positions at the same time, to be sure; but they occupy these po- sitions in succession" (p. 158). This is just what we recognize in Coppola's tragic narrative when we discover his antagonists as successive stages of the same protagonistic urge. Kurtz is not a redundancy but an uncovered double; and doubly, for there are, in those ritual sacrifices in which tragedy is rooted, two phases of displacement simultaneously illustrated</page><page sequence="16">470 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad by Coppola's violence. As Girard says, "All sacrificial rites are based on two substitutions. The first is provided by generative violence, which substitutes a single victim for all the members of the community" (p. 269). But here we have two communities, the American military estab- lishment and the Cambodian natives. Kurtz, defector from one, lord and protector of the other, is explicitly chosen by the first as a substitute for more than one Kilgore still within the fold and implicitly chosen by the second as a mad deity overstaying his secular reign. There follows "the only strictly ritualistic substitution, . . . that of a victim for the surrogate victim. As we know, it is essential that the victim be drawn from outside the community" (p. 269). The victim can be an animal, as for the natives, or a white interloper, as for Kurtz, or a self-exiled pariah, as on the American side of this equation Kurtz has become. It is only after Willard realizes how far beyond the pale Kurtz has slipped in his programmatic depravity that he can murder Kurtz not as his officer's duty but as a ritualistic performance. Hacked beast outside, hewn ruler within: a si- multaneous repetition that offers us a complex instance of ritual dupli- cation, cruel but illuminating. Finally, there is a further substitution: Kurtz's will to be exterminated taken up by Willard as a will to return. The demonic impressario of his own slaughter, Kurtz has staged both a private and a communal end to his quasi-divine rule. "From the purely religious point of view," writes Girard, "the surrogate victim--or, more simply, the final victim-inevi- tably appears as a being who submits to violence without provoking a reprisal; a supernatural being who sows violence to reap peace; a mys- terious savior who visits affliction on mankind in order subsequently to restore it to good health" (p. 86). Willard is Kurtz's delegate in this unspoken urge toward restitution, declining one last repetition of as- sumed godhead, breaking the pattern by retracing his steps along the line that, until severed, bound him inextricably to Kurtz. "The surrogate victim, as founder of the rite, appears as the ideal educator of humanity, in the etymological sense of e-ducatio, a leading out. The rite gradually leads men away from the sacred; it permits them to escape their own violence" (p. 306)--only temporarily, of course, for the rite as ritual is by nature recurrent, like history and like film. But it is this role of leading out that is specifically bequeathed by Kurtz to Willard when Lance is guided out from the sacred temple to whatever community is left, led away and back. That Kurtz can be taken in any sense to have intended this, that such matters are meant self-consciously to preoccupy him as well as Coppola, is lamely indicated when the camera spots Frazer's The Golden Bough and Weston's From Ritual to Romance lying allusively about, a pretentious sampling of Kurtz's acquaintance with cultural anthro- pology. But this movie, begun as a soured romance, undergoes its own generic erosion back to ritual tragedy, reversing the history of art in the formal equivalent of its own ethical reversions.</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 471 The plot is still, however, to suffer one more reverse, the ritual again internalized at the last minute, engorged by psychology. Willard, leading out, is led back into his own mind where the reciprocal violence must once more be replayed. Psychic reprise becomes its own worst reprisal, self-knowledge its own demythologizing scourge. Kurtz was the agent of ravage; Willard had to become the will of outrage, the mind and arm of a deed both lethal and cathartic. To extirpate, even to curtail a dark- ness, one must know and loathe it at close range. In the interchanged psychologies of the film, Willard must come to know it both in himself and for Kurtz, who seems in some measure inured to his own depravity and defensive about his vision of "moral terror" and its satanic tactics. This is the true territorial imperative of the allegorical journey in both story and film: we must explore and colonize our own dark natures certainly not in order to glorify them, even to acquiesce in them, but only the more guardedly to stand watch, at times to wage war, against their aberration and excess. Only full recognition can expunge an evil. The movie's Kurtz talks about logic and clarity but is still committing horrible and arbitrary murder right up to the time of his death. Someone must know better, but it can only be the self-or second self-if that knowledge is to be made potent, as mighty as the sword that would do it in and so drive it out. This is the ultimate parable of Coppola's blood- bath, the higher logic of its ferocity. We may all harbor the savage in our souls, wish at times to send it abroad, while a part of us must remain on hand to suppress or punish that desire. But if, on one framing of their duality, Kurtz stands for what is reprehensible in the human spirit as against Willard's power of comprehension and so of containment, the price paid for this further clarity is that such knowledge can never be shaken off, cannot help but follow Willard back down the river, echoing on the sound track over and above the film's last images. In Heart of Darkness, just before Marlow enters the house of Kurtz's Intended to tell a lie by which (certainly through which) he cannot escape pollution, he "seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The horror! The hor- ror!' " Yet this echo, this insistent epiphany from the past, is denied to the world in the person of Kurtz's fiancee, euphemized away. The moral vacillation in Coppola's narrative takes a different double turn. Instead of accepting the natives' adulation in brutality, the hero who slew the true scapegoat while the natives were offering up the animal surrogate suddenly discards his weapon. Mindlessly following suit, so do they, their guns layered across his path like palms in the footsteps of the new savior. Nemesis has become Messiah. Lest Willard believe in this finer deifica- tion, invest faith in this precipitous pacifism too good to be true-Cop- pola treading here a fine line between political satire and Hollywood melodrama, between irony and facile uplift-lest he submit to this ex- ternal image of himself, as dangerous in its healing apotheosis as is the previous temptation to lord his murderous power over the natives, he</page><page sequence="18">472 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad must be reminded in his own mind's ear that the darkness is with him still, a whispering and perpetual admonition. The ending of neither story nor film is confused, just bifocal. In Coppola we find writ large, for Willard as well as for us, what Conrad seems to keep from Marlow by ironic distance: that the return to civi- lization from primitive haunts can never lay the ghostly image of that bestial horror lurking within us, the horror that finds such kinship, regressed beyond any ethical restraint, in the jungle's heart of darkness. It is a horror which the tropical rain droning on the sound track as the film's last trace can scarcely wash clean. For just before, staring straight at the camera and through it at us for one final time, confirming earlier suggestions of the universal complicity in evil, Willard's disembodied face-the reflective mind as if unmoored from its whole self, decapi- tated-slides out of view to the right behind the dead but deathless carved image. With the film's narrator absorbed into the immemorial icon of that anthropomorphic vanity and villainy which has comprised his tale, Kurtz's "horror" comes onto the sound track as a primal echo in the soul, an echo drenched from without by the sounds of a world that outlasts but cannot quench it. Yet we are made to sense this destination in the premature fusion of imagery, including the stone idol, in the film's opening scene. Here may be a framework of repetition that encompasses and composes all the rest and that does so in an indirect reworking of Conrad's own ironic temporality. Shortly after a startling and awesome shot of napalm in- vading the silence of thejungle in the prologue, we see Willard practicing karate to keep in shape for whatever penitential mission will be assigned him, bloodying his hand against a mirror in his squalid hotel room. The right hand he injures here is the one he stares at and repeatedly flexes just before killing Kurtz, just before directing his earlier violence out- ward from the self toward an embodied reflection of it rather than a mirror image. ?ut even before this mirror scene, our first glimpse of Coppola's narrator has been upside down and queasily disoriented: we discover him staring up at the rotation of an overhead fan. Blade be- comes propeller in his mind's eye and ours: insignias of circularity in a prediction of the jungle encounter that will itself spin back in the end to that hovering image of the stone idol which now flanks Willard right- side up at the other side of the screen. As yet we have no way to sound the import of this fugitive, dreamlike image or of the other split-second subliminal premonitions that erupt on screen. Unassimilated glimpses forward into the Cambodian sequence, they suggest as well visual traces, psychic scars, left over from Willard's earlier forays into the jungle. Though Coppola's rhetoric at this point is entirely visual, this notion of circularity and proleptic repetition is one he could have taken indirectly from Conrad. In his study of repetition in literature and film, Bruce F. Kawin</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry Spring 1981 473 mentions Marlow in passing as "a compulsive narrator with many of the traits of the anti-hero whose tragedy he relates."' His earlier section on "Compulsive Repetition," however, can shed more light on Coppola's film, drawing as Kawin does on Freud's notions of therapeutic repetition and "working through." Circular imagery, itself symbolized by wheeling blades like the mechanism of a spinning brain, can be made to serve the purposes not only of retelling, as with the tradition of twice-told, obses- sively repeated tales of an Ancient Mariner or a Charlie Marlow, but of unconscious recurrence, compulsion, and inbred penance. There is a curious circular link in Conrad's story that anticipates in this way the underspecified, dreamlike prologue of Apocalypse Now and its fulfillment later by plot. Conrad's tale opens upon an aura of foreboding which we have no means to interpret. Marlow's auditors are gathered round him on board ship near the mouth of the Thames, but the clouded horizon suggests, by a pathetic fallacy we are unequipped so far to explain, "a mournful gloom, brooding motionless" over the entire earth. Only when the story's narrative course has aligned the sinuous Congo with the Thames estuariy in an unbroken indictment do we understand that the British river, too, in the last clause of the tale, "seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness." Apropos of nothing so far but of every- thing to come, Marlow's first words amount to a disconcerting non se- quitur that suggests a profound and fearsome continuity: "And this also ... has been one of the dark places of the earth." Answering nothing, knotted to nothing, the conjunction seems linked only to the story in his mind, as told and retold again, though never before to us or to his immediate listeners on the scene. Only after traversing the length of Heart of Darkness, as it threads together its two waterways and dovetails its historical epochs, is the brooding, elliptical conjunction justified, bridging the gap between now and then, us and them, empire and tribe, civilized codes and vile rites, progress and savagery-and between this instance of such a story and all those which precede it, as if every im- portant "once upon a time" is premised on a "so too here and now." Coppola wants this sense at the beginning of his film and devises the disjoint visual "and" he needs to convey it. Willard has been there before too, far down into the nether reaches of his soul, perhaps in earlier missions, certainly in unshakable visions. When the stone idol absorbs and displaces, or repeats and thus deletes, Willard's own face at the end, we are ready to probe the deeper logic by which Coppola has chosen to have his film swallow its own tail in a snakelike vicious circle. Classic symmetry has turned (inward) to psychology. Apocalypse Now is thereby detached from the immediate tem- poral designation of its title to suggest the human mind's recurrent 3. Bruce E Kawin, Telling It Again and Again: Repetition in Literature and Film (Ithaca, N.Y., 1977), p. 132.</page><page sequence="20">474 Garrett Stewart Coppola's Conrad nightmare of its own abyss, time out of mind. When Kurtz's "horror" haunts the sound track for the last time as a moral echo knowing no end to its repetitions, the idea articulates what was only latent visually in the film's inchoate first images. We realize in final retrospect that the stench of "nightmare" Willard encounters in the sanctum sanctorum of Kurtz's retreat is his own opening nightmare of blood, fire, and idolatry come true. Though the disoriented and disorienting first images of Apocalypse Now may suggest Willard's previous jungle missions, they are flashbacks, repetitions, half in the more disturbing sense that they tap race-old dreams or memories of terror, secrets from the collective unconscious of our savage origins. They are what ritual would defeat by repeating, the inescapable scourged by symbolic recurrence only to come again. Neither just retroactive nor, by poetic license, entirely clairvoyant, nei- ther guilty dreams nor prefigurations pure and simple, they are pro- phetic in the original sense of a soothsaying. For Willard's disorder of soul, long before he faces his alter ego in Kurtz, is a nightmare of demonic complicity of the most tormenting 'sort, a fever in the will that is complicity both before and after the fact. It is a torture of self-knowing that must be embodied and made assailable in the person of Kurtz. The "confrontation" Willard lives and is willing to die for is disclosed as a long appalling stare at the true form, the human form, in that broken, bloody, distorting, but still functional mirror with which the film so load- edly opens. Apocalypse, now or to come, means in its own original sense, after all, not only Doomsday but Revelation.</page></plain_text>
