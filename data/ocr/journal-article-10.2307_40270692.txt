Penn State University Press, University Park, 2005a) develops a vocabulary for understanding the social role of technological artifacts in our culture and in our daily lives. He understands this role in terms of the technological mediation of human behavior and perception. To explain mediation, he levels out the modernist separation of subjects and objects by decreasing the autonomy of humans and increasing the activity of things. His approach consists primarily within a clever integration of the theories of Latour and Ihde, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the social role of technological artifacts. Despite the fact that Verbeek' s book is carefully thought out and already quite influential in the field of philosophy of technology, his approach raises some con- ceptual and pragmatic questions. The conceptual questions concern (a) the precise meaning of the concept of mediation and the possibility of distinguishing between different forms of mediation, and (b) the differences and similarities between human and technological agency and intentionality. The pragmatic questions concern the application of his theory to the realm of engineering ethics. Particularly pressing is the question of how to assign (moral) responsibility to humans when technological artifacts are mediating the outcomes of human actions. With this article, I will raise these issues, and look forward to Verbeek's reply. Keywords Mediation • Technological agency • Responsibility K.

Waelbers Introduction Increasingly, technologies are designed for causing people to behave more "desirably." Blinking lights and irritating beeps notify drivers to wear their seatbelts. Some coffee machines make a horrible loud noise when the coffee is ready, so one cannot forget to turn them off. A 10 cm high pig statue is specially designed for people dieting. If placed inside a refrigerator, it starts dancing and grunting wildly every time someone opens the fridge, as if to say, "Eat some more and soon you will look like me!" In these examples the technological artifacts are clearly designed to influence our actions. But during the last decade, philosophical and sociological research has shown that almost all technological artifacts affect human actions and perceptions. Due to technological artifacts, people tend to perceive and do things differently. Transport and communication technologies make the world a smaller place. The microwave and the dishwasher changed many dinners from a traditional family event into an individual quick meal. Medical diagnostic devices force pregnant women to think in terms of risks, desirable versus undesirable babies, and the quality of the life yet to come. Perceptions and actions change as new technologies enter the world. How can we understand this social role of technological artifacts? What vocabulary will help us understand what things do? If the technological artifacts are interfering with human experiences and actions, humans can no longer be seen as subjects who autonomously act and experience the surrounding world. Furthermore, technological artifacts can no longer be understood as value-free tools. In other words, the modern dichotomy between subject and object seems to be inadequate. How can we sensibly describe the relationship between humans and technological artifacts? In recent decades, researchers have developed two influential but opposing theories to dissolve the subject-object dichotomy: post-phenomenology and Actor Network Theory (ANT). Phenomenology dissolves the dichotomy by explaining that reality arises through relations between humans and their surrounding. Post- phenomenologists add that these relations are mediated (shaped) by technological artifacts. In ANT, reality is seen as social networks of actants. Technological artifacts and humans are both actants in both of these theories, as both have a program of action. The theories lead to interesting viewpoints, but they seem to explain only part of the human-technology relationship. In his carefully written book What Things Do, Verbeek (2005a) discusses and integrates these theories in order to understand the social role of technological artifacts. He explains "what things do" in terms of the mediation of human behavior and perception. Furthermore, he suggests incorporating this understanding of mediation into the traditional aesthetic approach of industrial designers. In this way, Verbeek develops a new "material aesthetics" which is ethically informed. This dual approach makes What Things Do an interesting book for two different audiences. By combining post-phenomenology and ANT, it poses a new philosophical viewpoint on technology, which makes the book philosophically rewarding. Furthermore, the book offers a new way of bringing philosophy of technology into the practice of designing technical artifacts. Therefore, the work is £) Springer</page><page sequence="3">From Assigning to Designing Technological Agency 243 also useful for engineers and designers. However, Verbeek's approach also raises two problems: The conceptual adequacy of the central terms "mediation" and "intentionality," and the pragmatic consequences for the moral responsibility of engineers are questionable. Before discussing these two points, I will describe Verbeek's book. I will also make use of other articles by Verbeek because they provide a fuller view of his post- phenomenology theory. From Classical Philosophy of Technology to the Present Day The book is divided into three parts. The first part begins with a critical review of what Verbeek calls the "classical period" in the philosophy of technology. This is the period of, amongst others, Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger, who investigated the role of artifacts in culture and in everyday life. Verbeek (2005b, p. 3) argues, "the questions it (the classical period) posed are still pressing; its problems lie in the ways it has gone about pursuing the answers". However, the classical transcendental methods tend to look "backwards" to what must be presupposed in order to make technology possible. Verbeek, on the contrary, is more interested in looking forward: he wants to understand the social role technologies play. Further, he argues against the classical representation of technology as a radically transformative and essentially alienating power. This perception makes it impossible to consider the social role of individual artifacts, since technology is defined as an all-determining system or culture. It reduces artifacts to non-technological elements such as forces of social organization and the will to power. The alienation thesis is deeply embedded within this perception of technology, and, as a result, the perception of technology becomes too one-sided and too negative within Heidegger's and Jaspers' early work. Verbeek rightly argues that it is time to answer the traditional philosopher's questions about the social role of things in a more constructive way. In order to accomplish this quest, the second part of the book examines the work of contemporary philosophers such as Don Ihde and Bruno Latour. In this part, Verbeek (2005b, p. 203) shows how "technology mediates our behavior and our perception, and thereby actively shapes subjectivity and objectivity: the way in which we are present in the world and the world is present to us". Here, Verbeek works to unite what Ihde calls a "post-phenomenological" understanding of technological agency with Latour' s Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Post-phenomenology is more practice- orientated than traditional phenomenology, and it is in a sense comparable with the a-modernist concept of humans and non-human actants of ANT. According to phenomenology, one cannot understand subjects and objects separately. Instead, humans should be understood as constantly experiencing the (phenomena of the) world and realizing their own existence within this experienced world (of phenomena). Verbeek's theory is phenomenological in the sense that it tries to overcome the modern dichotomy between subject and object. It replaces the dichotomy between humans and the world with mutual interrelation. However, Verbeek (2005b, p. 113) is post-phenomenological in the sense that he places the technological artifact between human experience and the world. Reality arises £ Springer</page><page sequence="4">244 K. Waelbers within technologically mediated relations between humans and the world. Subject and object constitute each other in this mutual relation. So, artifacts are not just mediating humans; mediation constitutes both subjects and objects simultaneously: "Humans and the world they experience are the products of technological mediation, and not just the poles between which the mediation plays itself out" (Verbeek 2005b, p. 130). Based on Ihde, Verbeek focuses on the hermeneutical dimension of mediation, which refers to the transformation of human interpreta- tions of reality. Experiences and meanings in our technological culture are almost always mediated. Concrete examples that Verbeek mentions include glasses, microscopes, and wheelchairs, all of which transform the user's interpretations of the world. The argument that reality arises in the mutual relation between technology and people resembles the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) of Latour. But Latour focuses more on the mediation of action rather than perception. He elaborates on existential or pragmatic transformations of behavior, arguing that within the social network the actions of human and non-human actants cannot be distinguished from each other (Latour 1994). For example, if the human actant is not strong enough to reach his or her goals, the actant falls back on an artifact. The actant takes a detour via technological mediation, which often changes the ends of the initial àctant. As a result, the original actant reaches a new goal instead of his or her original goal. This does not mean that the human or the artifact becomes another actant, but that both become a new actant together. A gun and a man together make a gunman, which is a different actant than the two original ones. Within this a-modern perception, the actions of artifacts can no longer be distinguished from the actions of persons. Technical artifacts and persons become a new actant when they merge in action. Verbeek merges Latour' s and Ihde' s theories into a new one by distinguishing between the practical and hermeneutical dimensions of mediation. The herme- neutical dimension refers to the way technological artifacts affect our perception of the world (Ihde). The practical direction concerns the way people act and live (Latour). Although both authors have declared that their concepts are incommensurable (e.g. Ihde and Selinger 2003; Latour 1993), Verbeek argues that the differences between the two are not as impassable as the authors claim. Ihde' s concept of mediation is about how artifacts co-shape human experience, while Latour shows that human behavior in social networks is technologically mediated. "Latour' s project could be seen as picking up where Ihde's ends because it emphasizes systems of relations" (Smith 2003, p. 189). Latour, however, argues that Ihde's phenomenology is incompatible with his position because it consolidates and reaffirms rather than overcomes the subject-object dichotomy. Verbeek admits that post-phenomenology does not deny the poles of the dichotomy. Instead, the theory takes it as a starting point. But in contrast to Ihde's theory, Verbeek' s post-phenomenological approach does not deal with subjects and objects as pre-existing entities that assume relations with one another. In his post- phenomenology, these entities are constituted by their mutual relationship. Post- phenomenology reformulated in this way addresses Latour' s criticism. £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">From Assigning to Designing Technological Agency 245 Clarifying the Central Concepts Mediation Verbeek stretches the post-phenomenological concept of mediation to the practical domain in order to obtain a complete understanding of the role that technological artifacts play in our culture and in our daily lives. This structure provides a comprehensive view of the social role of technological artifacts via two forms of mediation: hermeneutical and pragmatic. However, on a conceptual level, "medi- ation," "intentionality," and "agency" remain unclear. Starting with mediation, does it mean that actions are transformed, co-shaped, affected (to what extent), or initiated by technological artifacts? Or can it mean all of this, depending on the situation? The disadvantage of the all-encompassing approach of Verbeek is that it leads to the conclusion that the social role of technological artifacts is solely to be understood in terms of mediation. Within his theory, almost everything we think and do needs to be understood as being mediated by technology. With this approach Verbeek runs into the danger of using mediation as an umbrella for explaining every aspect of technology. This paradigm has, alongside many advantages, two inconveniences. First it tends to veil rather than disclose the many different forms of human-technology interaction. Arguably, the aim of umbrella terms is to highlight common features - subcategories can always be added. Verbeek does this by making the valuable distinction between practical and hermeneutical mediation, referring respectively to the mediation of action and the mediation of perception. But this distinction is still too coarse. Consider for instance the social roles played by the Internet which are multi-leveled (individuals, families, communities, organizations, nations, regions), and consist of a great variety of human-technology interactions. Within this diversity, technologies and humans play many different roles. Is Verbeek' s vocabulary differentiated enough to understand this diversity? Can it accurately describe the many different ways in which humans and technology interact? Using an umbrella concept has a second disadvantage: it tends to claim a false exclusivity. Can the social role of technological artifacts be completely understood in terms of mediation? I argue not: many instances of design errors or negative side effects are not forms of mediation. For example, when young children were suffocated by some of the early airbags, was that to be understood as a form of mediation? Or was it just a serious omission in the design? A comparable question can be asked about nuclear waste. Should nuclear waste be understood as a form of mediation of nuclear energy, or is it better explained as a negative side effect? Are future nuclear accidents to be approached in terms of mediation or is it more useful to think in terms of risks, or is perhaps a combination of the two the most illuminating? Of course mediation plays a role in all of these examples. But if one asks, for example, about the social role that CO2 emitting technologies play in our contemporary lives and culture, only part of the story is told by focusing on mediation. Of course, human-technology interaction is necessary to produce CO2. Verbeek' s approach shows how deeply embedded these technologies are in our £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">246 K. Waelbers actions and perceptions. But the social implications of global climate change are much broader than mediation. Describing the mediation of CO2 emitting technologies will not provide us with a full understanding of the consequences of climate change. Summarizing, one can say that that the concepts of pragmatic and hermeneutic mediation are useful for describing the social role of technological artifacts, but further distinctions are needed to get a more detailed understanding. Further, although mediation may be an important concept for understanding the social role of technological artifacts, it does not reveal every important aspect. Intentionality and Agency Verbeek (2005a, b) uses the concepts of "intentionality" and "agency" to describe the mediation of technological artifacts. These concepts pose problems that have been recognized before, especially in relation to Latour' s work. Collins and Yearley (1992) were the first to accuse Latour of assigning modernist features of subjects to objects, and vice versa, because he uses the same language to describe humans and nonhumans. According to Collins and Yearley, Latour and Michael Callon are giving agency back to nature because their language introduces symmetry between humans and nonhumans; they anthropomorphize technological artifacts and, at the same, time objectify humans. Collins and Yearley (1992, p. 322) see this as reactionary: "This backward step has happened as a consequence of the misconceived extension of symmetry that takes humans out of their pivotal role". In his book Aramis, or the Love of Technology, Latour (1996) explicitly places humans and technological artifacts on the same level within the networks in which they are operating. Theoretically, this means that humans are leveled down and technological artifacts are leveled up, so that in the end they are equal-leveled with regard to agency. So, on a theoretical level, technological artifacts are not anthropomorphized, but humans and artifacts are "X-morphized" to an in-between level. Verbeek states explicitly that Latour is a-modern, which means that he wants to X-morphize1 humans and non-humans, rather than to anthropomorphize non- humans. Verbeek sets the "acts" of humans and technological artifacts on one level as he reacts against overly-simplistic views of humans as autonomous agents and artefacts as neutral tools. This is in line with Latour, but, as Laurier and Philo (1999) have argued, Latour is extremely anthropomorphizing in, for instance, Aramis. They show with numerous citations that Latour refers to technological artefacts as "people" (p. 227), "a central command post which sees, understands, feels, decides, acts, orders and manages" (p. 230), "being human parts" (p. 230), having "dictatorship" or being "democratic" (p. 230), having an "autonomous personal- ity" (p. 321), etc. (Latour 1996). In his later book Pandora's Hope (1999), Latour initially proposes to call humans actors, and technological artefacts actants (Latour 1999). However, in the same book, he suggests that the concept of agent can be used as a substitution for actant or actor, and in his glossary the definition of actor is similar to the definition of actant (p. 303). 1 I borrowed this term from Laurier and Philo (1999), Verbeek does not use it. £} Springer</page><page sequence="7">From Assigning to Designing Technological Agency 247 Verbeek differs substantially from Latour as he explains that his intention is to keep some distinctions between objects and subjects. In other words, he wants to distinguish between human and technological agents, while not falling in the trap of the subject-object dichotomy. According to Verbeek, the post-phenomenology of Ihde enables such a task. Following Ihde, he redefines mediation by making use of technological intentionality (2005b, p. 114): "by this he means that technologies... have a certain directionality, an inclination or trajectory that shapes the ways in which they are used." In his paper "The Morality of Design..." Verbeek (2005a) explains that the term "intention" is derived from the Latin word "intendere," meaning "to intend" and "to direct." Technological artifacts can be seen as intentional since they direct our actions. Verbeek argues that technological artefacts are capable of intentional action; therefore, it can be said that technological artefacts are agents. However, when talking about the agency of human beings, the word "intentionality" refers to the capacity to intend something, to have some kind of purposiveness or consciousness. Verbeek thus seems to avoid anthropomorphizing technological artifacts. Making the intentionality of technological artifacts of a different kind than the intentionality of humans makes it possible for Verbeek to distinguish between humans and technological artifacts. But is this difference not a concealed form of modernism? One can wonder whether here Verbeek is saying that contrary to technological artifacts, humans are conscious beings, and that therefore people can act and things cannot. Verbeek' s definition of intentionality means that the concept of an actant when talking about things is not commensurable with the concept of an actant when talking about humans. Technological artifacts are actants by virtue of possessing intentionality in the sense that they can direct something. Humans are actants since they have intentionality in the sense that they can intend something. Does this not lead to two different conceptions, making the two kinds of actants less compatible? Or to put it differently, is this not a modernist approach after all? To discuss this suspicion in more detail it is important to inquire into the consequences of this move for Verbeek (2005a) concept of agency. He argues that agency comes into existence when humans and technological artifacts merge into action: "mediation shapes the mutual relation in which both subject and object are constituted". But this adds up to conceptual confusion. At least it leads to the question: What does "agency" exactly mean? Several options are imaginable, though all of them create problems. One way to understand Verbeek is to say that artifacts possess agency equal to that of humans. The social sphere in which our actions and perceptions are shaped is extended, which leads to less autonomy on the individual level. More social forces are directing us; as the social sphere becomes denser, it can be argued that the level of social determination increases. If this is what Verbeek means, then the question is how he manages to distinguish between the agency of artifacts and the agency of humans. One cannot argue for the same kind of agency, but a different kind of intentionality. If I am justified in believing that this is not what Verbeek wants, other ways of interpreting his work must be found. A second option negates the question at hand. One can try to read Verbeek' s theory in the sense that only humans have real agency because only humans have £5 Springer</page><page sequence="8">248 K. Waelbers intentionality as a mental capacity. Technological artifacts only seem to have intentionality because they direct us. This directing force can lead to the same outcome as the rhetorical influence of other people. So, saying that technological artifacts have agency is only a manner of referring to the results, and agency is not a real attribute of technological artifacts. If this is what Verbeek intends, then why the use of the term "agency"? The concept of mediation will do, and it is not necessary to add the problematic notion of agency. But I wonder if this is what Verbeek intends, because in this interpretation the subject-object dichotomy remains as firm as the modernist intended it to be. The third interpretation of Verbeek's use of "agency" is to say that neither humans nor artifacts possess agency prior to their interaction. Rather, agency comes into being when the two are combined. This interpretation seems to be in line with Verbeek's desire to x-morphize artifacts and humans, and it does not lead to additional conceptual problems. But, unfortunately, it has some problematic practical consequences, since it follows that within this interpretation the agency of artifacts is not possible without a human contribution, and vice versa. It makes sense to claim that technological agency cannot be in absence of humans. However, it also means that human agency is not possible without the contribution of a technological artifact. This is a bold claim. For example, after being insulted, one can slap someone else in the face. These actions, insulting and slapping, can easily be performed without any mediating technology. It is true that one needs a gun in order to be a gunman, but one can be a fighter without any technological artifact. Surely Verbeek realizes that human agency is possible without technological mediation and the agency of technical artifacts is unthinkable without the human contribution. But once again it follows that technological agency would mean something different than human agency. So the question remains how to interpret these complex concepts within Verbeek's framework. Responsibility These analytical reflections are not just a matter of splitting hairs in the level of concepts. There are some important practical consequences for the possibilities of incorporating Verbeek's work into engineering ethics. This realm deals with issues pertaining to the meaning of morally good artifacts, responsibilities of engineers and users, the design of artifacts that promote "morally desirable" behaviors, and the role of ethics. Because Verbeek's concept of agency can be interpreted in several ways, the consequences for the moral responsibility of engineers are unclear. Nevertheless, his insights are too important to simply ignore in the field of engineering ethics. In the article "Do You Believe in Ethics," Aaron Smith (2003) pinpoints the question of moral responsibility when discussing the differences between Latour's and Ihde's positions. Latour's and Verbeek's theories imply that persons cannot be held fully responsible for their actions because the technology, being an actant, mediates them. The question Smith asks is whether Ihde or the gun should go to jail after they have jointly shot Latour. This question of responsibility is also crucial to £} Springer</page><page sequence="9">From Assigning to Designing Technological Agency 249 Verbeek's theory, since he leans heavily on ANT. Though Verbeek anthropomor- phizes less than Latour, his theory leaves the question open as to whether it is possible to assign responsibility. In Verbeek's theory, artifacts do not have intentionality in an anthropomorphic sense, and, therefore, in contrast to some critics (e.g., Floridi and Sanders 2004), they cannot be held morally responsible within his theory. Of course, artifacts can be causally responsible, meaning that they have causal affects which may be morally better or worse, but one cannot prescribe moral accountability to artifacts. But the question remains, to what extent can humans still be held responsible for their actions if it is true that the outcome of human action is strongly affected by technological artifacts? In classical ethical theory, an agent can only be held responsible for the consequences of her or his deed if and only if (a) the agent performed the act, (b) the agent intended and/or foresaw the consequences, and (c) the agent could have done otherwise (Lenk 1993). When following Verbeek in his understanding that the human actant is not the only one performing the act since agency arises when the human and the artifact merge in action, and that the final outcome cannot be fully foreseen since it is partly intended by the technology, one should conclude that both conditions (a) and (b) are not (completely) fulfilled. Further, it is questionable how much freedom of action a human actor has within ANT (c). As a consequence the human agent cannot be held morally responsible, which has important implications for ethics in engineering practices. In the third part of his book, Verbeek seems to assume a quite autonomous engineer, i.e. having a modern form of agency. The new vocabulary Verbeek develops in the second part is used in the third part to develop a "material aesthetics" for engineers and designers. "Material aesthetics" is a form of aesthetics that is not only concerned with the visual appearances of things, but draws attention to the products themselves. This kind of aesthetics should be ethically informed and take into account the two dimensions of mediation. When designing technological artifacts, engineers should build-in desired norms and values. Verbeek explains this quite relevant message with the inspiring example of the designing philosophy of the company Eternally Yours which specializes in designing artifacts that last a lifetime, also from an aesthetic viewpoint. With his Material Aesthetics, he assigns significant responsibility to the engineers. In "Stimuleer Gedragsbeïnvloedende Technologie" (2004) and in "Materializing Morality" (2006), Verbeek pushes this point even further and orders engineers to deliberately design technological artifacts that make people act more "desirably." For instance, he states that it is the engineer's responsibility to design technological artifacts in such a way that people behave in an environmen- tally friendly way. Does a material aesthetics not presuppose an autonomous engineer-a modern subject-who creates a technological tool - a modern object - to control other people? Verbeek argued earlier that the modern dichotomy between subject and object is at least overrated and that artifacts are not merely neutral tools. Technological artifacts are mediating forces. The question is how to reconcile his implicit notion of responsibility, on which his material aesthetics seems to be based, with his a-modern vision of human and technological agency. £} Springer</page><page sequence="10">250 K. Waelbers Closing Remarks As shown rather critically, concepts such as "mediation," "intentionality," and "agency" raise many questions pertaining to artifacts and their social role. Nonetheless, Verbeek manages to use these concepts in a way that yields useful insights into the social role of artifacts. He makes it clear that technological artifacts have a social force and that human beings cannot be understood as subjects with full autonomy. Though questions remain about the consequences of this new theory for the ethics of engineering, Verbeek makes an important point when he argues that engineers and designers should take pragmatic and existential mediation into account when they are creating their products. Summarizing, Verbeek' s What Things Do is well worth reading, because it offers a new program in the philosophy of technology. It asks questions about the social role of technological artifacts in an illuminating new way, and it addresses the need for a new kind of ethics which has direct relevance for engineering practices. And since he is currently writing his second book on this issue, Verbeek holds great promise for solving these questions. References Collins, H., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological chicken.
