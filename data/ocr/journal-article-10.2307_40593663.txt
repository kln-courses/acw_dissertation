<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sebastian I. Sobecki, The Sea and Medieval English Literature. (Studies in Medieval Romance.) Woodbridge, Eng., and Rochester, N.Y.: Boydell and Brewer, 2008. Pp. xii, 205; 9 black-and-white figures. $90. This ambitious study of the sea and medieval English literature reconfigures an impressive array of Insular and Continental texts, and several arguments serve as its underlying cur- rents. Among its primary objectives, the book traces the dynamic relationship between notions of Englishness and insularity, and it exposes the sea's growing territorialization in medieval English social and political thought; at the same time, the book presents a broader cultural history of the sea via literary texts. More specifically, Sobecki traces how "the literary history of the sea in English literature becomes a part of the vernacular discourse of Englishness" throughout the Middle Ages, and he maintains that a focus on the sea in literary texts illuminates "the emergence of insularity in the context of 'being English' " (p. 4). As this work reveals shifting perspectives on the sea, it also charts "the development of [the] cultural life of the sea, as mediated by literature" (p. 24). In advancing these overlapping goals, the study embraces diverse "modes of writing," from hagiography, ro- mance, and biblical exegesis to monastic and patristic writing and even legal commentary (pp. 22-23). While this study reveals shifting conceptions of the sea over time, it is important to note that its "network of close readings" does not seek to trace a monolithic discourse or cog- nitive conception of the sea; instead, it shows "how English writers employ the sea to generate literary meaning and negotiate two broad cultural fields, those of myth and con- nectivity" (p. 4). In the introduction Sobecki productively synthesizes theories of connec- tivity from Mediterranean and South Pacific cultural studies to reconceive the sea as "a facilitator of multilateral exchange" (p. 12). Insofar as early Irish cultural hegemony in the British Isles is concerned, "literature was an integral element of maritime connectivity, . . . both a cultural good to be exchanged and a facilitator of such exchanges" (p. 16). The</page><page sequence="2">778 Reviews sea's "mythopoeic vigour" and "range of metaphorical and allegorical uses ... in the literature of pre-modern England" are certainly a major aspect of the book (p. 21), but it is the sea's role as a facilitator of cultural and literary exchange - and the dynamic rela- tionship between literature and the sea - that underlies the subsequent chapters. A brief chapter summary cannot do justice to the full range and scope of this study, but I can at least identify some of its most compelling arguments. Chapter 1 identifies an uneasiness and ambiguity regarding the sea in preconquest texts. In classical, biblical, and patristic writing the sea is often perceived as "a formidable primordial element" (p. 35), and in the "mythical placing of the sea in the Judaeo-Christian continuum" (p. 39) the sea is increasingly associated with evil and unruliness. Eventually, "the sanctity of land . . . [territorializes] the unholy sea" (p. 41). In a brief excursus on Anglo-Saxon texts, Sobecki astutely observes that "Old English writing . . . assign[s] considerable narrative space to the sea" (p. 43) and often invites readers "to think of the sea as land-like, paved by the many ways of expressing sea-voyages as paths" (p. 45). Chapter 2 ventures into postconquest territory and romance traditions. In Sobecki's analysis, Benedeit's Anglo-Norman Voyage de Saint Brandan transforms "the sea from the religious desert of patristic and Irish spirituality to a landscape of adventure," a process that "not only heralds the coming of romance, but also is evidence of the Normans' osmotic process of assimilation" of Insular and Celtic seafaring narratives (p. 55). The second section of the chapter turns to the Tristan romances, proceeding through their Old Norse, Latin, Anglo-Norman, Middle High German, and Middle English versions. In a particu- larly evocative reading of the Anglo-Norman Tristan of Thomas, Sobecki illustrates how a complex nexus of maritime and amatory puns (V amer /la mer lamer) blurs the sea with bitterness and Marian allusions (pp. 66-68). Chapter 3 examines Britain's perceived position "on the outer edge of the infinite ocean" in Gildas, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Matthew Paris, Higden, and others (p. 98). Conversant with recent work on cartography and literature (including studies by Alfred Hiatt and Kathy Lavezzo), Sobecki places Britain "against the spatial and the temporal end of the world," and he interrogates the extent to which insularity constitutes English identity (p. 77). In an unexpected but welcome reading of a Middle Dutch text, Sobecki demon- strates that "Britain's fringe position at the end of the world and its spiritual geography" was not limited to English writers (p. 98). Chapter 4 investigates the relationship between land, sea, and identity in the Anglo- Norman and Middle English romances of King Horn. Focusing on littoral encounters - and the contact zone between land and sea - Sobecki offers a highly nuanced perspective, and he exhibits sensitivity to the meter and stress patterns in the Anglo-French and Middle English poems (pp. 107, 111). The chapter ends with a brief reading of John Gower's tale of Apollonius, tracing the poet's interests in Neptune and "the narrative possibilities of the sea" (p. 118). Chapter 5 examines the biblical account of Jonah and the whale alongside the Middle English Patience, and a concise analysis of The Book of Margery Kempe highlights the text's "narrative indebtedness to the peregrinatio pro amore Dei and the Brendan-legend. . . . Margery's life combines the motifs of exile-by-sea and pilgrimage-by-sea in a text whose generic boundaries remain in flux" (pp. 138-39). Chapter 6 marks a departure from previous chapters, as it sets a single text alongside shifting legal conceptions of the sea. Sobecki shows how the development of the seemingly paradoxical concept of "territorial waters" informs the fifteenth-century Libelle of En- glyshe Poly eye, a political poem that urges the English to "kepe the see" (guarder la mere) and assert sovereignty over the Channel (p. 153). Sobecki's analysis culminates in a bold assertion. Not only does the Libelle mark a "groundbreaking contribution to the devel- opment of the notion of territorial waters" (p. 154), but it also demonstrates that "literary</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 779 texts such as the Libelle [can] even become agents of epistemological shifts" (p. 159). A thought-provoking epilogue on Shakespeare's Tempest closes the book, demonstrating "how heavily indebted the play is not just to the ubiquitous romance tradition but also to the many facets of the sea in pre-modern literature" (p. 164). One theme that emerges throughout this book (and its many effective close readings) is the sea's paradoxical nature. Superficially simple to identify and define, the sea is so diverse in its functions and so rich in cultural resonances that it is notoriously difficult to grasp. In confronting a notion as complex as the sea, this study admirably rises to the challenge. Nonetheless, certain aspects of the book could have benefited from more leisurely analysis. For instance, I would have appreciated a more careful distinction between "England" and "Britain" throughout the work. While the study wisely attends to local contexts, it could have taken into account at least a few moments when "Englishness" precariously detaches itself from, or resists equivalence to, Britishness. The reading of the Libelle rightly acknowl- edges the importance of Calais in English geopolitical thought, but I often wondered to what extent English claims to possessions elsewhere on the Continent or English colonial campaigns in Ireland (so richly elaborated by writers like Froissart) might further test the limits of medieval English insularity prior to the close of the Hundred Years' War. Perhaps in an effort to accommodate a wide range of texts, some of the chapters move at a hurried pace. Most notably, the section on The Book of Margery Kempe (ripe with romance and maritime motifs) occupies a mere nve pages at the end of chapter 5. Moreover, the Kempe section follows a reading of Patience when it could more logically follow the Brendan legends in chapter 2. While one might take issue with aspects of its scope or organization, this work is indeed engaging and groundbreaking, and its fluid movement across Celtic, Latin, Anglo-Norman, Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and Middle English contexts is remarkable. I very much appre- ciate how a sustained focus on the sea across a range of genres reorients many a familiar text. Most importantly, this study resists reducing the sea or maritime motifs to mere "dis- courses" transmitted through literary texts, and the juxtaposition of literary and extra- literary material has surprising effects. In both literary and legal conceptions, for instance, the sea is not a static entity but rather an active "mythopoeic agent" (p. 10), and "in the anthropomorphic nature of contractual terminology" the sea functions as both subject and vassal (p. 152). By examining the sea and - not in - English medieval literature, Sobecki reveals that the sea indeed has a dynamic cultural life of its own. Ultimately, this work traverses languages, genres, and historical periods, and - much like the sea itself - it opens up many trajectories for future exploration.
