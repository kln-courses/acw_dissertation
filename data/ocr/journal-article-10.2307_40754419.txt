<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILIP FURIA tfIS, the whited monster" : Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited IN "THE QUAKER GRAVEYARD IN NANTUCKET," ROBERT LOWELL'S EL- egy for his cousin Warren Winslow, there is an image that has proved almost as confusing as Milton's "two-handed engine" - the gigantic whale mariners call "IS, the whited monster" (III, 17).1 Most readers have followed Hugh Staples's conjecture that the whale represents Christ and that "IS" may be an abbreviation for lesus Salvatori But certain difficulties arise when that interpretation is applied to the poem. If IS represents Christ, why is he a "monster"? Why does his "corrup- tion" (V, 2) overrun the earth? Why does the poet plead for his death and why, when the whale is slain, do the "morning stars sing out to- gether" (V, 15) ? Why, moreover, does Lowell seem to identify IS with Moby Dick? Jerome Mazzaro's assertion that IS is "Moby Dick who, to Lowell, represents Christianity"3 seems as dubious for Lowell as it does for Melville. Such problems as these have understandably led a recent interpreter to conclude, "The IS passage . . . cannot really bear any serious or direct Christian significance and can only suggest, in the dense overlay of symbols and references, that Lowell is uncertain about the relationship of the forces of nature and their mythologized expres- sion to God."4 Indeed, the reader stands before the poem much as Ishmael stood before the murky painting in the Spouter Inn and, dis- cerning the shape of a whale at its center, muses, "That once found out and all the rest were plain."5 I believe this leviathan can be "found out" - and a good deal of "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket" made plain - if we look at the work from which Lowell draws so many of his symbols, the Book of Revela- tion. Lard Weary' s Castle, the volume that included the elegy as its showpiece, ends with the terrors of the Apocalypse descending from the sky and the poet crying out, "I am a red arrow on this graph / Of Revelations."6 Much of that early poetry does form such a graph, a graph that links Boston with Babylon, World War II with Armageddon, and the imminent holocaust of that war with the Day of Judgment.7 Leviathan appears in Revelation as Antichrist, the Beast who rises from the sea, deceives nations into worshipping him, then ravages the entire earth until Christ returns and with a mighty sword slays the monster, thus fulfilling the prophecy that "the Lord with his sore and great and</page><page sequence="2">838 PHILIP FURIA strong sword shall punish Leviathan" (Is. 27:1). In the purgative fire of the Apocalypse the old world is then destroyed, and the Bible con- cludes with St. John's vision of "a new heaven and a new earth" (Rev. 21:1). Lowell refers specifically to the Beast in other poems such as 'To Peter Taylor on the Feast of the Epiphany" where "Whore and Beast and Dragon rise for air / From allegoric waters"8 and "Beyond the Alps" where he speaks of "The Number of the Beast,"9 the number St. John gives as "six hundred threescore and six" (Rev. 13:18). In "Where the Rainbow Ends," furthermore, we find a connection be- tween IS and the Beast. There, in his only other use of "IS," Lowell sees "the furnace-face of IS" and breathes "the ether of my marriage feast." 10 Given the many other allusions to Revelation in the poem, the marriage feast is probably the "marriage supper of the Lamb" (Rev. 19:9), a supper that consists of the flesh of the Beast and his followers which Christ gives His faithful to celebrate His victory. The feast is prophesied in the Old Testament - "Thou breakest the heads of levia- than in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness" (Ps. 74:14) - and in Jewish Messianic tradition - "at the end of the world, Messias will catch the great Fish Leviathan, and di- vide its flesh as food among the faithful."11 It may then be that "IS, the whited monster" is not Christ but Antichrist, the Beast that Christ slays in the Apocalypse. If so, it is understandable that Lowell would call IS a "monster," that he would see its "corruption" overrun the earth, and that he would plead for its death. So, too, the morning stars would "sing out together" as joyfully as they did at Creation (Job 38:7), for the death of the Beast marks the beginning of a new heaven and earth. If Lowell has a specific reference in mind, it may be to this verse: "Behold the beast that was and is not and yet is" (Rev. 17 :8).12 Lowell does not limit the meaning of IS to Revelation, but extends and enriches his symbol by references to some of the many works that have made leviathan one of the most prevalent and complex images in literature.13 With his "steel scales" (I, 23) and trailing "slick" (III, 19), IS resembles Job's leviathan whose "Scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal" (Job 41:5) and who makes a "path to shine after him" (Job 41:32). The "furnace-face of IS" also recalls the countenance of Job's whale: Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or cauldron. His breath kin- dleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. (Job 41:19-21) IS also is Jonah's whale, the beast that swallows rebellious and dis- obedient man. Lowell may have drawn on the metaphoric connection</page><page sequence="3">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 839 between leviathan and the grave suggested by Christ's phophecy that "as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth" (Matt 12:40).14 Perhaps this connection explains why "whited mon- ster" seems to echo the Biblical phrase "whited sepulchre" (Matt. 23: 27). (Ishmael also describes the mouth of Moby Dick as a kind of whited sepulchre - "an open-doored marble tomb."15) To worship the beast is death, both literal death and death-in-life, and only Christ, who is "Jonas Messias" (V, 18), can deliver man from the entombment as He delivered Himself from the sephulchre. The Resurrection may thus be seen as a victory over leviathan, as Lowell himself portrays it when he announces, "The grave / Is open-mouthed and swallowed up in Christ."16 That victory, in turn, prefigures Christ's return to slay the Beast and resurrect all men from their "unstoned graves" (IV, 20) in the Apocalypse when "there shall be no more death" (Rev. 21:4). Elsewhere in the poem Lowell follows the elegiac convention of blending Christian and Classical imagery when he identifies IS with Poseidon. In his identification with the sea, his violent nature, and his devastation of Troy, Poseidon may have seemed to Lowell a fitting ana- logue for the Beast.17 He describes that normally anthropomorphic "earth-shaker" (Poseidon's standing epithet is enno si gaios) as "green, unwearied, chase / In his steel scales" (I, 22-23). Poseidon is "chaste" because the sea his "blue beard," is 'unharvested' (the standing epithet of his element is atrygetos), and the man's efforts to "harrow," to culti- vate that sterile wasteland are "fruitless" (III, 2-3). But this terrifying god is also 'chased' by foolish mariners who are "swallowed up quick" (III, 24) in the blue mouth of his Atlantic. Moby-Dick, of course, is the most obvious source for IS, and without delving into the ambiguities of Melville's symbol, I would suggest that Lowell bases his identification of IS with the white whale on Ahab's belief that Moby Dick embodies "all evil."18 Ahab, furthermore, con- strues his pursuit of the whale as a defiant worship of that evil: "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. ... I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so ? ... Take the homage of these poor eyes and shuttered hands. . . . Leap ! Leap up, and lick the sky ! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defying I worship thee."19 In this remarkable speech Ahab indicates that his assault on Moby Dick may be seen as a defiant act of homage to the power of evil, as though</page><page sequence="4">84O PHILIP FURIA the greatest service one could render the Beast would be to try to kill him. His reference to being "burned" in ''the sacramental act" explains the livid white scar branded in his countenance that seems to Ishmael "a crucifixion in his face."20 That mark would be the mark of the Beast which all of its followers wear in their foreheads (Rev. 13:16), and Lowell seems to allude to it when he says, "the heel-headed dogfish barks its nose / On Ahab's void and forehead" (I, 14-15). Ahab's de- fiant 'following* of the whale makes him one of Job's "children of pride" over whom leviathan is "king" (Job 41:34), foolhardy sailors who serve their lord by pursuing him until they become his unwitting sacrificial victims. In a less obvious way Lowell identifies IS with the State, Hobbes's Leviathan, just as he does in another early poem entitled "Leviathan." There the poet addresses the Hobbesian "Ship of State" on its bloody path of war: Great Commonwealth, roll onward, roll On blood; for while the ocean monster flings Out its Satanic stings, Or like an octopus constricts my soul, You haul leviathan to the king of kings.21 Here the ship of state is the human counterpart of the "ocean monster" with its "Satanic stings" because the State, like the Beast, has deceived men into service and now plunges the whole world into the destruction of war. Once we put the poem in the context of Revelation, we can see why Lowell urges that ship to "Roll on": he knows that ultimately the ship will haul leviathan - itself - to Christ who will slay it and free the world from its terrors. In "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," the leviathan of State is symbolized by the "dreadnaughts" of World War II that presently de- vour the world but soon will be devoured themselves by the Beast they worship. The Pequod, too, that "cannibal of a craft"22 tricked out in the bones of whales so that it seems a skeletal leviathan itself, is a micro- cosmic state, a bastion of arrogant democracy bent on a crusade of rebel- lion against God. In the fifth stanza, therefore, Christ returns to slay this leviathan ship of state, and at the same time He kills the whale that originally sent "the Pequod packing off to hell" (IV, 4) : In the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat The bones cry for the blood of the white whale, The fat flukes arch and whack about its ears, The death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears The gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail, And hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags</page><page sequence="5">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 841 And rips the sperm-whale's midriff into rags, Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather, Sailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers Where the morning stars sing out together And thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers The red flag hammered in the mast-head. (V, 6-19) Christ's sword simultaneously hacks out the coiled viscera of the whale and smashes the timbers of the Pequod. In a gruesome feat of obstet- rics, Winslow is delivered from the shredded belly of the whole, just as the entrapped gull is released from the dismembered red flag of the Pequod. (When the Pequod sinks at the end of Moby-Dick, a gull en- tangles itself in the ship's red flag, and Tashtego hammers it to the masthead, as though "The ship, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven with her."23) Thus while Lowell draws on other sources for IS, they tend to sup- port and enrich the central identification of the whale with the Beast. Once we have understood the basic meaning of the whale, moreover, we can begin to see the whole of 'The Quaker Graveyard in Nantuck- et" as a "graph of Revelations." Briefly sketched, the poem begins with the picture of the world about to be ravaged by the Beast it worships, moves to a description of Christ's victory over the monster, and closes with a vision of a new heaven and a new earth. The unfolding vision of these future events reconciles the poet to the present horrors of war and to the world's imminent destruction, for he understands that only through such suffering and devastation can the world and man be saved. Such an understanding informs most of Lowell's other apocalyptic poems: man's disobedience and rebellion against God, his arrogant pur- suit of wealth, and his blind disregard for human life in a merciless and senseless exercise of power have gone too far, and now the only way to salvation lies through the devastation of the Apocalypse. In "To Peter Taylor on the Feast of the Epiphany," for example, Lowell knows that . . . only Armageddon will suffice To turn the hero skating on thin ice When Whore and Beast and Dragon rise for air From allegoric waters. Fear is where We hunger.24 The hero is man, blithely skating to destruction as the Whore of Baby- lon, the Beast, and Satan the Dragon rise to devour him. Only Christ's victory at Armageddon will defeat that unholy trinity and turn man back to salvation. 'Tear is where we hunger," and only the brutal hor-</page><page sequence="6">842 PHILIP FURIA rors of the Apocalypse can shake man into "sacred terror,"25 into fear and trembling, and wrench from his throat a frightened plea to God. With this knowledge that now only by moving to that End can there be a new beginning, Lowell, as we have seen, urges the leviathan of State to "Roll on" to Armageddon. In "The First Sunday in Lent," he prays to God for a new creation out of that imminent destruction: "Lord, from the lust and dust thy will destroys / Raise an unblem- ished Adam."26 In these and other early poems, Lowell portrays the terrors of the Apocalypse, but in "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantuck- et," we find one of the few poems where he looks beyond that End with any assurance to the return of Christ and the promise of a new world. In that respect, this elegy is probably Lowell's most complete "graph of Revolutions." Once we have grasped the apocalyptic pattern in "The Quaker Grave- yard in Nantucket," we can understand its conventional elegiac pattern of grief transformed into reconciliation and celebration. The poet's 'revelation' of the fulfillment of prophecy is generated by the death of Winslow, a death which seems at first merely a "portent" (I, 17) of the destruction of all men who serve the Beast. Yet as that revelation unfolds and Lowell foresees the return of Christ and the beginning of a new heaven and a new earth, he witnesses his cousin's resurrection from the belly of the whale and his ascension into Sion, "portents," in turn, of man's salvation and rebirth after the Apocalypse. Thus, while the poem begins with Lowell's despairing meditation on the battered corpse of his cousin, it concludes with his serene prophecy of a new birth for all men. In the final stanza, Lowell stands over Winslow's cenotaph in the Nantucket graveyard and looks out at the sea, that other graveyard of drowned sailors. He recalls the first creation, when the sea's murderous waves lumbered after man and now, finally, have de- voured their prey; but he knows, too, that out of the coming End, there can be a renewal and rebirth of man: You could cut the brackish winds with a knife Here in Nantucket, and cast up the time When the Lord God formed man from the sea's slime, And breathed into his face the breath of life, And blue-lung'd combers lumbered to the kill. (VII, 12-16) Having looked forward to Revelation, Lowell here looks back to Gene- sis. Out of the coming destruction you "could" cast up a new creation; out of the End can come the Beginning. In another paradox, out of death will come birth; out of the sea's belly that now "guts its spoil"</page><page sequence="7">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 843 (VIII, 11) of dead men will come the rebirth of man - the tomb will become a womb. Lowell's fusion of the pattern of Revelation with that of elegy may have its source in "Lycidas," for the resurrection and apotheosis of Ly- cidas follow Milton's apocalyptic vision of the "foul contagion" of mankind and the "grim wolf" who "daily devours apace" and the prom- ise that the "two-handed engine" of Christ will soon wreak vengeance upon the corrupt (lines 125-31). The prophetic pattern of Revelation can give order and meaning to the chaos of the present, and thus serves Lowell in what Richard Fein has called the poet's struggle "to main- tain a Christian image above the contemporary violence, yet one which has further meaning in terms of that violence ... the war returns us to a basic Christian awareness which in turn preserves the war from being meaningless violence."27 In that respect, Lowell's use of apocalyp- tic prophecy resembles the "mystic method" as T. S. Eliot outlined it in his essay on Ulysses: "It is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of fu- tility and anarchy which is contemporary history."28 Lowell's ability to understand the meaning of "Jehovah's buffets and his ends,"29 to see that out of the present destruction of the world will come a new heaven and new earth, that out of suffering will come man's salvation, and out of death, rebirth, enables him to present a vision that transforms a pur- poseless hell into a meaningful purgatory. In "Little Gidding," Eliot describes such a transformation as one from the infernal fire of point- less torment to the cleaning fire of purposeful suffering: The only hope, or else despair Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre - To be redeemed from fire by fire. (11. 204-06) Lowell's use of the prophecy of Revelation to give order to contem- porary history, however, goes considerably further than Eliot's "mythic method," because he not only imagines that the Apocalypse is occurring in the present, but implies that the events of Revelation are in fact taking place. He does not, of course, literally see a beast off the Nan- tucket coast which Christ slays as a New Jerusalem descends from the heavens; rather, he seems to suggest that the symbolic figures and events of Revelation have their counterparts in things that are now happening and that shortly will occur. In this sense, his method is closer to what Frank Kermode, in The Sense of an Ending, describes as that of mod- ern eschatology: "Eschatology is stretched over the whole of human history, the End is present at every moment, the types are always relè-</page><page sequence="8">844 PHILIP FURIA vant."30 Since the Apocalypse is a condition present at all times, its figures and events have their counterparts in all historical periods. Thus, Lowell identifies IS with Moby Dick, with Job's whale and Jo- nah's, with Poseidon, with Hobbes's Leviathan, with modern dread- noughts as well as with the Pequod, because they are all the Beast or, as Kermode would put it, "types of him." And modern man's worship of the Beast will bring the same destruction upon the world today that it has in the past, though the particular form of that devastation may be a mushroom cloud rather than a devouring flood. What then are these contemporary 'types' or analogues for the events and figures of Revelation? What "Beast" does man worship? What will happen that will correspond to the return of Christ to defeat that monster? What form will the new heaven and earth take? Although the answers to such questions are only implied by the poem, I believe they can be made considerably more explicit if we examine a book that Low- ell drew on substantially in "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket." That book is E. I. Watkins's Catholic Art and Culture, a study of the relationship between Catholic art and the history of Western civiliza- tion since the Middle Ages. Published in 1944, just a year before "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," Watkins's book concludes with the apocalyptic prediction that the materialism and secularism which have grown rampantly since the Renaissance will soon bring the world to destruction. Yet out of that imminent holocaust, Watkins foresees a great spiritual victory of the Church over these forces which will usher in a new world, a new "religion-culture" of peace and contemplation that will be the "kingdom of the Holy Ghost."31 Watkins symbolizes this new era as the world's return, after the suffering and horror of war, to the Shrine of the Virgin at Walsingham, England: For centuries the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham has been an historical memory. Now once again pilgrims visit her image, erected in a medieval chapel where, it is said, pilgrims once took off their shoes to walk barefoot the remaining mile to the shrine. . . . The road to the shrine is a quiet country lane, shaded with trees and lined on one side by a hedgerow. On the other a stream flows down beneath the trees, the water symbol of the Holy Spirit, "the waters of Shiloah that go softly," the "flow of the river making glad the city of God." Within the chapel ... is seated Our Lady's image. It is too small for its canopy and is not superficially beautiful. "Non est species ñeque decor'; there is no comeliness or charm in that expressionless face with heavy eyelids. . . . That expressionless countenance expresses what is beyond ex- pression. It is the countenance of one whose spirit dwells in a region beyond emotion and thought, in that centre of which mystical writers speak. Mary is beyond joy and sorrow. For her spirit is in God, and she knows as He knows, receiving His knowledge. No longer the Mother of sorrows nor yet</page><page sequence="9">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 845 of the human joy of the Crib, she understands the secret counsel of God. . . . And the inscrutability of that illegible countenance is the inscrutability of the Divine Will made known to her.32 In the headnote to Lord Weary' s Castle, Lowell informs us that the en- tire sixth stanza of "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket" is an adap- tation of several paragraphs from Catholic Art and Culture. If we com- pare the passage just quoted with that stanza, we can see how closely Lowell followed Watkins's description: OUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM There once the penitents took off their shoes And then walked barefoot the remaining mile; And the small trees, a stream and hedgerow file Slowly along the munching English lane, Like cows to the old shrine, until you lose Track of your dragging pain. The stream flows down under the druid tree, Shiloah's whirlpools gurgle and make glad The castle of God. Sailor, you were glad And whistled Sion by that stream. But see: Our Lady, too small for her canopy, Sits near the altar. There's no comeliness At all or charm in that expressionless Face with its heavy eyelids. As before, This face, for centuries a memory, Non est species, ñeque decor, Expressionless, expresses God: it goes Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows, Not Calvary's Cross nor crib at Bethlehem Now, and the world shall come to Walsingham. But why, at this crucial point in the poem, does Lowell adapt Wat- kins so extensively? I would suggest that in Watkins's description of the shrine of Walsingham, Lowell found a contemporary analogue for the new heaven and earth of Revelation. In fact, not only is Watkins's description, with its mention of Shiloah and the "city of God," sug- gestive of the New Jerusalem, but there are striking parallels between Lowell's adaptation and St. John's vision of the new world: "castled Sion" suggests the walled city as it is described in Rev. 22:12-25; the "gurgling stream" and the "druid tree" correspond to the "river of water of life" (Rev. 22:1) and the "tree of life" (Rev. 22:2); Wins- low is free of his "dragging pain" just as in the new world "there shall be no more pain" (Rev. 21:4); and Mary's visage that "expresses God" seems to fulfill the promise that in the new world God's faithful</page><page sequence="10">846 PHILIP FURIA * 'shall see his face" (Rev. 22:4). Lowell, furthermore, presents the vision of Walsingham immediately after Christ has slain the Beast, and the stars sing out joyfully to celebrate the imminent new creation, just as, in Revelation, the new heaven and new earth descend after Messiah has defeated the armies of the Beast. It seems quite clear, then, that Watkins's modern version of the Apocalypse provided Lowell with an analogue for the new heaven and new earth, but it is also possible that Watkins suggested to Lowell simi- lar analogues for the return of Christ and for the identity of the Beast as well. Let us look at the passage in Watkins from which Lowell de- rived his climactic line, "Now, and the world shall come to Walsing- ham." Our contemporaries worship power, the natural energy that drives machines and, on a higher level, is the life-force of animate things. Before the new world they desire can be born, they must learn the lesson Our Lady of Con- templation would teach us, that the power which alone can bring that new world to birth is supernatural, the power of God, the power that is also rest and silence, the power of contemplative prayer. In that sense, rather than in impressive statistics of conversion, will the sayings prove true that when Eng- land goes to Walsingham, England will return to the Church. When the world goes thus to Walsingham, it will return to the Church. Nay, it will become the Church.33 Here, I believe, Lowell found a full-fledged typology for his "graph of Revelations." The Beast is power, the amoral and anarchic power that man worships, wields, and serves, the power that will soon devour him and bring the world to destruction. Christ's return to slay the Beast cor- responds to the spiritual victory of the "power of God" over such power, a victory that will only come when man has learned, through the suffer- ing and devastation of war, the "lesson" of contemplation. When the world goes thus to Walsingham, there will be a new era of faith and peace which will be the spiritual equivalent of the new heaven and earth of Revelation. If we apply Watkins's modern typology of Revelation to "The Quak- er Graveyard in Nantucket," a great deal of Lowell's elegy can be made clear. The poem opens with Lowell's realization that Winslow's death is a "portent" of the Apocalypse: Sailors, who pitch this portent at the sea Where dreadnaughts shall confess Its hell-bent deity, When you are powerless To sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced By the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste In his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute</page><page sequence="11">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 847 To pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet Recoil and then repeat The hoarse salute. (I, 17-26) Here Lowell envisions the End, when man shall be "powerless" before the power he worships, swallowed, like Winslow, by the * 'earth-shaker/' Watkins, too, describes that imminent doom in an image suggestive of rebellious man devoured, Jonah-like, by the Beast: "The world is delivered as a prey to the unleashed forces of animal vitality restrained by no rule of reason or faith, the fitting Nemesis of human pride seek- ing self-sufficiency/'34 The Beast that embodies the power man wor- ships is about to devour its servants, and Lowell hears in the booming guns of Winslow's funeral the sound of man's awesome worship of power. The dreadnoughts "confess" their dread of the "earth-shaker" and, like timid supplicants feverishly chanting their prayers, "recoil" and "repeat" the "hoarse salute" to their deity. It is "power" that characterizes leviathan in the different sources Lowell uses for IS. Job's leviathan, who is "king over all the children of pride," and Jonah's whale, who devours the rebellious and disobedi- ent prophet, both seem examples of what Watkins describes as "the fitting Nemesis of human pride seeking self-sufficiency." Insofar as he is the most violent and destructive god in the Greek pantheon, Poseidon is a fitting analogue for the Beast, and in his destruction of the walls of Troy Lowell may see a préfiguration of the Beast's devastation of our "Atlantic bulwark" (I, 21). Ahab construes Moby Dick as "out- rageous strength with an instrutable malice sinewing it," the agent of that "speechless, placeless . . . supernal power" that he so "defyingly" worships and longs to feel welded against his own flesh.35 Hobbes's Leviathan is a commonwealth founded on man's desire for power, and by serving it man has brought the world to the brink of annihilation. Watkins makes much the same point when he says, "The strong na- tional state, far from being a bulwark against anarchy, has become itself the source of an international anarchy which threatens to destroy civili- sation."36 Throughout his early poetry, moreover, Lowell has castigated the worship of power as a faith which has turned the history of America into a chronicle of warmongering, economic pillage, and self -destructive rebellion against God. He describes our founding fathers, who deserted the Church of Rome for a violent and cruel Protestantism, as the un- witting servants of Satan: Our fathers wrung their bread from stocks and stones And fenced their gardens with the Redman's bones;</page><page sequence="12">848 PHILIP FURIA Embarking from the Nether Land of Holland, Pilgrims unhouseled by Geneva's night, They planted here the Serpent's seeds of light.37 The descendants of those Pilgrims were Yankee "clippers" and ' 'slav- ers"38 - New England merchants whose ships devoured wealth and men - who were so consumed by their lust for economic power that Lowell symbolizes their own enslavement by saying, "Leviathan / Devoured our mighty merchants."39 Now the world reaps the harvest of those Satanic seeds of light; as Lowell watches the blinding explosion of a war that has resulted from man's worship of power, he sees the Beast unleashed upon the world: "Leviathan breaks water in the rice / Fields, at the poles, at the hot gates to Greece; / It's time."40 The only salva- tion from the Beast whose bowels "break water" is not in the faith from the "Nether" land (Lowell's eschatology is often scatological) but in the Church, the "haven" of the Virgin that those "clippers" and "slavers" never "reached."41 In "The Crucifix," the poet describes him- self as a dog fleeing the Flood who finds, "to Via et Vita et Veritas / A stray dog's signpost is a crucifix,"42 and that signpost shows the way back to Walshingham. In "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," the Apocalypse begins to gather force in the brewing storm of the second stanza where wind and water are locked in elemental strife as the wind's "claws rush / At the sea's throat and wring it in the slush" (II, 14-15) in vengeance for Winslow's death. In the third stanza, the End looms even nearer as Lowell stands in the Nantucket graveyard and listens to the barrage of naval gunfire off the coast. The battleships are "cradled on the tide" (III, 6), but their guns "rock" that precarious cradle and soon will bring it crashing down. These dreadnoughts seem to Lowell "Our war- ships in the hand / Of the great God" (III, 10-11), a bitterly humor- ous pun on Jonathan Edward's apocalyptic sermon which suggests that our "warships" are indeed our "worships" - power-worshipping war- ships that testify to our allegiance, not to God, but to the Beast. Our fate is prefigured by those drowning Quakers who pursued IS with the smug assurance that God was on their side: "If God himself had not been on our side, If God himself had not been on our side, When the Atlantic rose up against us, why, Then it had swallowed us up quick." (Ill, 21-24) These are the Quakers Ishmael calls "fighting Quakers, Quakers with a vengeance,"43 whose quaking worship is not of God but of the "earth-</page><page sequence="13">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 849 shaker," and who are condemned out of their own mouths as they are indeed "swallowed up quick." Those nineteenth-century whalers, however, died "When time was open-eyed, / Wooden and childish" (III, 14-15); now time has come to an end, and Lowell announces that End in the fourth stanza: This is the end of the whaleroad and the whale Who spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell And stirred the troubled water to whirlpools To send the Pequod packing off to hell: This is the end of them, three-quarters fools, Snatching at straws to sail Seaward and seaward on the turntail whale, Spouting out blood and water as it rolls, Sick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals. (IV, 1-9) There are actually three "ends" announced here: that of the sea ("whale- road" ) , the Beast, and that of the fools who sail the watery three-fourths of the globe in pursuit of him - and all of these ends are predicted in Revelation. After the Apocalypse, "There shall be no more sea" (Rev. 21:1), and Lowell portrays that end in the image of the land as an "enormous snout / Sucking the ocean's side" at ebb tide until the source of life is sucked dry, leaving only "the death-rattle of the crabs" (IV, 14-16). In using the Anglo-Saxon kenning "whaleroad" {hron- rad) for the sea, Lowell may have in mind the mystic identification of the sea as leviathan, a huge serpent that encircles the earth with its tail in its mouth.44 The death of the Beast, then, would mean the end of the sea as well. At the Last Judgment, the "sea gave up its dead" (Rev. 20:16) and here "we are poured out like water" (IV, 18). The whale who once sent the Pequod "packing off to hell" (IV, 4) and now spreads its "cor- ruption" over the earth will soon meet its own doom. When Lowell describes the whale as "Sick as a dog" (IV, 9) he may be using the old pun, dog/god, to underline the fact that, as Antichrist, the Beast is the opposite or, as Blake would say, the "contrary" of Christ. As Lowell watches the vomit of IS flood the world, he pleads for the "mast-lashed master of leviathans" (IV, 19) to slay the monster. That master is cer- tainly not Ahab who, although he was lashed to the mast after his first encounter with Moby Dick, ultimately proved not the master but the victim of leviathan. Only Christ, lashed to the Cross but risen from His "whited sepulchre," can defeat the Beast and raise all men from their "unstoned graves" (IV, 20).</page><page sequence="14">850 PHILIP FURIA The fifth stanza portrays that victory. The scene is "the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat" (V, 6) where God has promised to defeat His enemies and "make the heavens and earth shake" (Joel 3:2-16). There the bones of the dead cry out for the blood of the white whale, just as the bones in Revelation call out to God for vengeance (Rev. 6:10). With His mighty sword, Christ "works and drags / And rips the sperm- whale's midriff into rags," leaving gobbets of blubber and the stoven timbers of the Pequod for the gathering gulls, a fulfillment of the prophecies of Revelation (Rev. 19 and 20). The spiritual analogue for this victory over the Beast is what Watkins describes as an epiph- any of God's power to confront and overthrow the amoral and anarchic power now worshipped by man. Such an epiphany can only come when man, through the suffering and destruction of war, has learned the "les- son" of Walsingham; his spiritual return to the Shrine of the Virgin will usher in the new heaven and new earth. The power of God, how- ever, is a "latent" power that "will be released by a living understand- ing of Catholic truth." The Shrine of Walsingham is significant in fostering such an epiphany, for it is a place of prayer and contempla- tion, and "contemplative prayer alone can achieve this understanding and release this latent power."45 If we are looking for the kingdom of the Holy Ghost, the reign of the con- templatives and the birth of a new religion-culture of their fashioning, we shall do well to pray for it in spirit, if we cannot in body, at the ... shrine of "Our Lady of Contemplation." . . . Prayer can take refuge in the sanctuary of Walsingham and there, in union with Mary's adoring contemplation, ask that the inscrutable will of God, by ways known to Him and to her, may pre- pare an Epiphany of His spirit that will defeat these merely natural and human forces.46 In the fifth stanza of "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," Lowell portrays the victory of Christ over the Beast, and, in the sixth stanza, he is present at the Shrine of Walsingham to pray for the spiritual equivalent of that symbolic victory. It is interesting to look at Watkins's description of the form that epiphany of God's power will take, in the light of Lowell's own im- prisonment as a conscientious objector in 1943: Not by concordat, still less by establishment, will the Church of God van- quish a rebellious humanism, but by the refusal of men and women led and strengthened by the Spirit to co-operate with a godless state which refuses their right to the free exercise of their religion and free obedience to its pre- cepts.47 Reading this, Lowell may have come to see his own refusal to serve the leviathan of State not only as an act of civil disobedience but as part of</page><page sequence="15">Lowell's Quaker Graveyard Revisited 851 the apocalyptic struggle between Christ and the Beast. That imprison- ment, moreover, underlies Lowell's characterization of himself as an "exile* ' in various early poems.48 Imprisoned for his faith and exiled from his country and heritage, the poet resembles St. John of Revela- tion who was exiled to the penal colony of Patmos "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 1:19). Lowell may well call himself a "red arrow on the graph / Of Revelations," since his conversion to the Church and his refusal to serve Leviathan point the way out of the terrors of the Apocalypse and toward the peace of Walsingham. At the end of Lord Weary* s Castle, the poet stands alone after the Apocalypse and, like Noah after the Flood, receives the olive branch of peace from a dove: "What can the dove of Jesus give / You now but wisdom, exile? Stand and live, / The dove has brought an olive branch to eat."49 That bitter branch of wisdom seems like the Book an angel gives St. John, saying "Here is wisdom" and commanding the prophet to "eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter" (Rev. 10:9). It is such wisdom that the exiled poet seeks, the wisdom that is em- bodied in the Virgin, sophia, who "knows what God knows" (VI, 18). Because this wisdom transcends human knowledge, it "puts out reason's eyes,"50 and the eyes of the Virgin are blank and "expressionless" (VI, 14) in their mystic grasp of the inscrutable will of God. This wisdom is the "power of God" which Watkins describes as "contemplative." It is learned through suffering, but it transcends both joy and sorrow in its serene understanding of God's eternal will behind the disorder of the present. By his own spiritual presence at Walsingham, Lowell seems to have gained that wisdom and felt that power, and in his effort to express his sense of serenity and reconciliation, he seems to follow Watkins's urging to the Catholic artist: "Catholic art can learn to ex- press indirectly, in the more austere idiom suited to our age and tech- nique, what cannot be expected directly . . . the silence of union with God in the depths of Spirit."51 Because it does give expression to such peace and silence emerging out of the suffering and holocaust of war, "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket" makes manifest that mystic power and wisdom. In that respect, Lowell's elegy itself is part of the apocalyptic struggle between the power of God and the power of the Beast, for it gives form to the power of God, an epiphany of the Word in the words of poetry. In the course of the poem, Lowell has witnessed a vision of the return of Christ, the death of the Beast, and the emergence of a new heaven and new earth. Because he has seen that out of the destruction of the present world shall come a new world, he can say of the imminent devastation, "It's well" (VII, 6). Through revelation and suffering,</page><page sequence="16">852 PHILIP FURIA the inscrutable will of God has been made clear to him as it was to the Virgin, and he can say "Thy will be done." What to the eyes of reason might seem a breach of the covenant between God and man that is symbolized by the rainbow is, to the eye of the contemplative rapt in the wisdom of the Virgin, a mysterious and awesome fulfillment of God's promise to love and care for man. To know that inscrutable will of God is to know that "The Lord survives the rainbow of His will" (VII, 17). That knowledge also reconciles Lowell to what had seemed the senseless death of his young cousin. The vision of Winslow's fate - his death, his Jonah-like imprisonment in the whale, and his deliver- ance at the hands of Christ - shows Lowell that his cousin is not a portent of the end of man but of man's resurrection and transformation. The resurrection of Winslow out of the destruction of war seems to answer Lowell's plea in "The First Sunday in Lent": "Lord, from the lust and dust thy will destroys / Raise an unblemished Adam."52 In the transformation of Winslow's mangled and ghastly corpse, that "botch of reds and whites" (I, 8), into the healed and unblemished penitent who walks slowly down the crunching lane toward Walsingham, Low- ell sees a portent for the rebirth of all men. Like Lycidas who was resurrected to become the "Genius of the shore" (line 183), Winslow becomes a préfiguration of the "deified humanity"53 that Watkins pre- dicts will inhabit the world. Winslow's apotheosis is foreshadowed right from the beginning of the poem when his gleaming corpse surges up from the sea like a nimbus. Even his eyes that at first seem only "lustreless deadlights" (I, 10) look forward to the "heavy eyelids" (VI, 14) of the Virgin and suggest that all men will eventually learn the lesson of contemplation expressed in her face. Pressing Biblical typology, one could say that the poem ends where the Bible ends: with Adam united with Christ. In the last stanza, Lowell stands over the cenotaph of Winslow much as Mary stood before the empty tomb of Christ - beyond suffering, rapt in the visionary grasp of God's will, and serene in the knowledge that the whited sepulchre does not hold the one he seeks.
