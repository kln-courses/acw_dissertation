BY EDWARD E. SALISBURY. (Read October 25, 1849.) VOL. II. 33</page><page sequence="2">INTRODUCTION. . - . _. SOME time ago, I received from Dr. Henry W. De Forest, missionary in Syria, an Arabic manuscript of fifty-seven leaves, consisting of three docuinents which throw new light upon the opinions held by the Isma'ilis, and other sects of Allegorists, or Mystics, of Muslim origin. Two of these documents bear marks of being authoritative with the sects themselves whose views they profess to represent; while the other, though controversial ill its design and charac- ter, is valuable for comparison with them. The history of the Isma'ilis and their branches, of which the Druzes con- stitute one of the most important, is, at least in its outlines, sufficiently well known. But excepting the Druzes, whose books have now for some time been in the hands of the learned, the opinions of none of them have been definitely ascertained. Of the Nusairian and Isma'ilian documents announced within the last three years, in France and Ger- many, as recently discovered, only outlines with brief extracts, or mere tables of contents, have as yet been published.t Under these circumstances, though witll some diffidence, I publish the following translation of two of the documents * See Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Inscriptions, Tome xvii. pp. 127, ff.- Xotices et Extraits des Mantbscrits, Tome ix. pp. 143, ff.- C.

The docurnent set aside consists of two fragments of what purports to be a conversation between Muhammed Ibn 'Aly El-Bakir and lihalid Ibn Zeid El-Ju'fy, related by the latter in the form of a &amp;3L&lt;,, i. e. Missive, for the purpose of directillg certain persons sup- posed to have " deviated from the path of rectitude." The former of the two interlocutors here introduced can be no other, as the conversation itself shows, than tlle fifth Imam of the Isma'ilis, comnionly known as El-Bakir, a great- grandson of the Khalifeh 'Aly; the other, who appears as an inquirer, is not so easily identiSed, but may be conjec- tured to be a descendant of 'Aly, whose Mather was a brother of El-Bakir.:t But, illLasmuch as Esh-Shahrastany informs us that the Shl'ite sects, after the ti1ne of El-Bakir, were much disposed "to pass o" their opinions "upon his fol- lovers," and " to refer their origin to him, and to fis tlnem oll him," the question naturally arises, whether we have, in this Missive, the genuine doctrine of El-Bakir, or that of some party availing itself of his name to give currency to views in reality not his. To judge by what Esh-Shahra- stany tells us of the opinions of El-Bakir, the Missive in question might be taken as an authentic expression of his rnilld, for he here denies, eithegr explicitly, or by implication, each of certain doctrines which are particularly mentioned by Esh-Shahrastany as not actually held by him, and which therefore appear to have been tlLose oftenest ascribed to him falsely. It is possible, however, that some party with which he was llot so generally confounded, or perhaps kindred to hiS OW1l, nray have here used his name without authority. At all events, this ASissive sets forth doctrines different from those maintained by either of the sects referred to, or rep- resented, in the other two documents. The first portion of the followirlg translation is made f rom the controversial document. The original of this is entitled &amp;So15t *x19 &amp;*\*:WXt &amp;itlL b*lSt wfL^ &amp;S&lt;9tt Csl: i. e.

It seems to have been written on the appearance of some followers of }(armat in the Mtady Hamah, pl^obably near to Hamah ill Syria, " be- tween Homs and Kinllesrin," as Abulfeda says, who adds that those who threw off the faith of Islam, had free range there.@ There is no precise indication of the date of its compositioll, nor is the name of the author given. He only calls himself Esh-Shafi'y, or the Shafi'ite. This document consists of three parts. The author begins with eight hun- dred and tllirty-two lines of rhymed tneasure, in which he portrays the hated party against which he writes, in collcise alld pointed terms. These rhymirlgs I have passed over in translating, as the fuller statements in prose which follow them, though less piquant as a specimen of controversy, may be luore safely relied upon for information. Next 1S introduced a piece in prose by another author. This author calls himself El-midy, and it may be suggested as quite probable that he is the Seif ed-din El-midy whom Ibn Khallikan speaks of as having taken up his residence at Hamah, and there composed xrorks "on the principles of religion, and jurisprudence, and logic, and philosophy, and disputation," and whose death, as the same authority in- forms us, took place A. II. 631, i. e. A. D. 1233-4.t It is worthy of notice, in this connection, that a poltion of this piece strikingly resembles what Von Harnmer published many years ago, on the Isma'ilis, as in substance contained in a work by El-Jorjany,: who, according to D'Herbelot, died A. H. 816, i. e. A. D. 1413-14.§ The third part of this document is a statement of inquiries respecting the Nusairis, presented to Takky ed-din Ibn Yatmiyeh, with his answer. This person was a distinguished doctor of Mus- lim law, who died, according to D'Herbelot, A. IJ. 768, or, as some say, A. H. 748, i. e. A. D. 1366-7, or A. D. 1347-8. 1 See Geographie d'Aboulfeda, ed. Reinaud et De Slane, pp. 262-3. t See lbn Khallikan's lUictionnaire Biograuphique, ed.

This document was obtained by Rev. Dr. Eli Smith, missionary in Syria, froin DIikhail Meshaka of Damascus. The second portion of the following translation is made from a document without title, but of which the nature of the contents is sufficiently evident. It consists of four pieces. The first piece presents a system of cosmogony; the second, a formula of religious belief; the third, a mys- tical allegorizing of the doctrines set forth in that formula; and the fourth, a st;atement of the doctrine of the Imam. All these pieces are in form declarative, not ar,umentative; and in reading them attentively olle callllot resist the im- pression, that they are specimens of the so-ca]led serlYlons whicll the Da'is, or missionaries, of the Isma'ilis are said to have been in the habit of deliverillg, at stated seasons, in general assemblies of the sect, to those asThom they would initiate into their system.@ That they express Isma'ilian doctrine is put beyond doubt by allusiolls contained in them. But, what is more, one may even refer some of them, with considerable confidence, to particular grades of initiation which are described by oriental writers as recog- nized by this sect, and are briefly alluded to in our first docu- ment. For the fourth piece evidently belongs to that stage of iilstruction of wllich the object was to impress with the sense of dependence upon the Imain; and the third, to that which was designed to initiate tlle proselyte into a pre- tended mystic sense of the doctrines and precepts of Islain wlrile the seconct might very appropriately have been deliv- ered to less advanced scholars, by way of "pretension of agreement with them on the part of the great in religious and worldly afEairs," that is, the leading religious and civil authorities of the day, or those of the Muslims, which our controversial document charges upon them as one of their practices. The date of these peculiar missionarv-sermons cannot be exactly determined. But tlnere seems to be an intirnate connection between them all, so that whatever date belongs to one is probably to be affixed to all. T'nis docu- ment, so important for its contents, was obtained tllrough n See Memotres de 5'Iststztz6t, Tome iv. pp. 4-S. 262</page><page sequence="6">263 the courtesy of Mr. Von Wildenbruch, late Prussian C:onsul General for Syria, whose dragoman, Mr. Catafago, found it near Aleppo. As a farther introduction to the following translation; are here added translations of several passages :Erom Esh-Shah- rastany's celebrated BooD of (reeds and Nects, relative to the parties to be brought before the reader. The passage above referred to, in which this author gives an account of E1- Bakir, is also appended. It seemed the more desirable to make these extracts, as no English translation of this high authority on such subjects is known to have been pub- lished; and the German translation by Haarbrucker, of which the first volume has recently appeared, although a good one, does not supply the place of one in our own lan- guage. The first of these extracts relates to the Isma'ilis, under the more general name of the Batinis, which illellldes also the followers of Karmat and the Nusairis.t The second is on the Ghalis, the Extravagant Shi'is, in general.: The third is on that particular portion of this party denomina- ted the Nusairis and Ishakis.§ The fourth relates to E1- Bakir.ll Exactness has been my aim in translating; and to this every thing else has been sacrificed, so far as was consistent with preserving the English idiom. The foot-notes are intended mainly to Macilitate the understanding of the text. A discussion of the many interesting topics suggested by it, would probably have been premature, if indeed it could have been entered upon. " The Batinzyeh., This appellation is affixed to them only because they give out that every thing outward has an inward; and every letter of revelation, an allegorical sense. And they have many appellations beside this, according to * Abu-'l-Fath Muhammed asch-Schahrclstdnt's Religtons-Partheien und Phi- Iosophen-Schulen, zum ersten Male vollstandig aus d.

For in 'Irak, they are named the Batiniyeh, and the Karamateh, and the Maz- dakiyeh ;@ and in Khorastin, the Ta'limiyeh,+ and the Mul- hideh.: And they say, ' NVe are Isma'iliyeh,§ for we are clistinguished from the parties of the Shl'ah, by this name and this impersonation.' " Now the ancient Btitiniyeh have mingled with their sys- tem something of the system of the sect of Philosophers,ll and composed their books after that way. Say they respect- ing the Creal;or, let him be exalted ! ' As for us, we say not that he is existent, nor that he is non-e:xistent; neither that he is one who knows, nor that he is ignorant; neither that he is one possessed of power, nor that he is impotent; and in like manner, with regard to all the attributes. For veritable affirmation requires the assoeiation of him with other existences in that respect in which we speak of hiIn absolutely, and that is anthropomorphism; so that he does not admit of judgment by absolute affirmation and absolute denial; oll the contrary, he is the Deity of those who staYld opposed to one another, and the Creator of disputers, and the arbiter between those who difSer.' And respecting this, they also tell of Afuhamirled Ibn 'Aly E1- Bakir, that he said, 'Because he bestows know]edge on the knowing, it is said that he is one who knows; and because he bestows power on the powerful, it is said that he is one possessed of power. So then, he is one who knows, one possessed of pover, in the sense that he bestows knowledge and pover, not in the sense that knowledge subsists in him, and power, or that he is qualified with * i. e.

But it is said respecting them that they are deniers of the attributes, who despoil the divine essence of the attributes. " Say they, ' And in like manner we say, with regard to eternity, that he is not eternal, nor originated; on the con- trary, the Eternal is his Amr and his Word,* and that which is originated is his creation and his workmanship. He produced, by the Amr, the prime Intelligence, which is perfect in action; and by the intervention of that, he pro- duced the secondary Sotll, which is not perfect. -And the relation of the Soul to the Intelligence is either the relation of the genital seed to the perfection of created form, and of the egg to the bird, or the relation of the child to the father, and of the odspring to her who brings forth, or the relation of the female to the male, and of consort to con- sort.' Say they, 'And because the Soul yearus afacer the completion of the Intelligence, it requires motion from in- completeness to completion, and motion requires the means of motion. And so the celestial spheres originate, and move with a circular movement, as governed by the Soul. And after them, the simple natural properties originate, and move with the movement of directness, also as governed by the Soul. And so are compounded the composites, namely, minerals, and plants, and animals, and man; and particular souls enter into bodies. And the species of Inan is distin- guished from other existences, by peculiar preparedness for the eff8usion of those Lights; and his world stands opposed to the whole world. And an Intelligence and a Soul which is universal, in the higher world, makes necessary that there should be in this world an impersonated Intelligence which is a whole, and of which the bearing is the bearing of a complete, mature impersonation,' which they name the Natik,+ and which is the Prophet, ' and an impersonated Soul which is also a whole, and of which the bearing is the bearing of an infant who is incomplete, tending to comple- tion, or the bearing of the genital seed tending to perfec- * It will be evident, farther on, that the Ism&amp;'ilian Word, or Amr, is a prime emanation from the Deity, having divine names and attributes, but distinct from the Deity itself. t Nitik, i. e.

And these movements of the celestial spheres, and the rules enjoined by law, are ollly in order to the Soul's attaining to thf3 state of its completion; and its completion is its attain- ing to the degree of the Intelligence, and its being united to that, and its reaching the rank of that, as an actuality. Alld as for that, it is the greater resurrection, upon which the compoundings of the celestial spheres and the elements, and the composites, are unloosed; and the heavens are rent; and the stars are dispelqsed; and the earth is es- changed for the absence of earth; and the heavens are rolled up like the rolliilg u) of the scroll for the Book, writtenaupon within; and creatures are reckoned with; and the good one is separated froul the bad one, and the obedi- ent one, from the disobedierlt one; and the constituents of truth are joined to the whole Soult and the constituents of falsehood to the false Sheitan.t And so, from the time of motion up to rest is the beginnirsg; and from the time of rest up to that which has no end is the coropletion.' " Moreover they satJ, ' There is no statute, nor rule, nor sentence of the sentences of lawl concerning barter, or patronage, or giving, or marriage, or divorcey or wound- ing, or revenge, or the price of blood, without its counter- part pertaining to the worldN by number against numt ber, and bearing against bearing; for the laws are worlds spiritual, of the Amr, and worlds are the laws embodied, belonging to created things. And in like nwanner, the compoundings which respect the letters and the words [of the lKuran,] are in the way of counter-part to the com- * Asas, i. e. Foundation, is the name given in the Isma'ilian systein to the first of seven supposed successors of every NAtik, that is, the first of seven Imams of each period, whose office it is to confirm his teaching by the dis- closure of its allegorical sense. t See Rev. vi. 12-17; Id. 2y2 5.</page><page sequence="10">267 poundings of forms and bodies; and as for the single let- ters, their relation to the composites, of the words, is as bare simples to composites, of bodies. And every letter has a counter-part in the world, and a natural property vvith which it belongs, and an impress, so far as that property is in souls. And so, in consequence of this, sciences deriving virtue from the words of instruction, becotne an aliment to souls, lile as aliments deriving virtue from the natural properties belonging to created things, become an aliment to bodies. And God has indeed ordained that something of that out of which it was created should be the aliment of every esistence.' " And on the ground of this equivalence, they go to tell- ing the numbers of the words and verses [of the lOuran,] and that the calling upon the divine name* is a coluposite of seven and of twelve; and that the extolling God is a composite of four words in one of the formulas of testi- mony, and of three words in the second formula of testi- mony; and that there are seven segments in the first, and six in the second; and that there are twelve letters in the second;t and in like manner, with regard to every verse which admits of their calculating its number; all which he who is intelligent exercises not his thought upon, without coming short of it, through fear of his meeting his match ! " These counter-balancings constituted the way of their men of early times; who cornposed books respecting them, and called men to an Imaln, in every age, who knows the equivalences of these sciences, and directs to the paths of these positions and definitions. " Afterwards, the men of the new call departed from this way, when El-Easan Ibn Es-Sabbah proclairned his call, and was unequal to the exigencies of his word, and asked * g**&gt;v&gt;5 e ;lt gtW i e.

And the com- mencement of his going up to the castle of Alamut was in Sha'ban in the year 483. And that was after he had made a journey to the country of his Imam, and had got from him how to call the men of his age; upon which he returned, and called men with the first of a call to the doctrine of the appearance of a rightful Imam taking his stand in ever;r age, and of the distinction of the party which obtain deliv- erance from the other parties in this point; which is to say, that they have an Imarn, and that the others haxTe not any Imam. And the refined gold of his system, after the rejec- tion of that which was said respectillg it, aluounts, ultio mately, in the Arabic lallguage and in the Persian language, to this particular. And as for us, we shall translate that which he wrote in the Persian language, into the Arabic; and there is no fault resting upon the translator; and the prospered is whosoever follows the truth, and turns aside from falsehood; alld God is the Prosperer, alld the Helper. " So then we begin with the four Articles with which he began the call, and which he wrote in the Persian, and so I have put into the Arabic. Says he, ' He who gives an answer respecting the knowledge of the Creator, let him be exalt ed I has olle of two things to say, either to say, ' I know the Creator by mere intellect and speculation, without need of the teaching of a teacher," or to say, "There is no way to knowledge, with intellect aild speculatioll, except by the teachillg of a rightful teacher.' Says he, 'And whoever answers with the former, denies not another's intellect and speculation. For, as for him, if ever he so denies, he teaches; and the denial is a teaching, and a proof, that that which is denied has need of something other thall itself.' Says he, ' And the two parts are both necessary consequences. For as for man, whenever he gives decisions, or makes a decla- ration, he speaks on his own part, or on the part of another; and in like manner, whenever he is bound with an obliga- tion, he is bound with it on his own part, or on the part * The FAtimite Khalifeh Mustanser-billah, who reigned in Egypt when Hasan began his career, is undoubtedly here intended. Before Hasan estab- lished an independent dynasty, he went about in the character of an Isma'ilian Da'i, advocating the legitimacy of the Fatimites, .as descenda.nts of 'Aly, against the 'AbbAsides. See Mem. de ItInst., Tome iv. p. 8 * Xottces et Ewtratts eles Slanuscrits, Tome iv. p. 687; Id. Tome ix. p. 152, fE</page><page sequence="12">269 of another.' This is the first Article; which is a rupture with the Men of opinion and intellect.* " And he states in the second krticle, as follows: ' Since the need of a teacher is established, is then absolutely every teacher suitable, or must there of necessity be a rightful teacher?' Says he, 'And whoever says that every teacher is suitable, is not allowed to deny a teacher adverse to him- self, forasmuch as, when he so denies, he yields the point that there must of necessity be a reliable, rightful teacher.' So much for this. And this is a rupture with the Men of tra- dition.t " And he states in the third Article, as follows: ' Since the need of a rightful teacher is established, must there not of necessity be knowledge of the teacher, first of all, and pos- session of him, and afterwards instruction by him ? or may there be illstruction by every teacher, without his person being fixed upon, and his right being made clear? And the latter is a coming baGk to the forrner,: forasmuch as, if one can not walk the way, except with one going before, and a companion, let there be the companion, and after- wards let the way be trod,' which is a rupture with the Shi'ah. " And he states, in the fourth Article, that ' men constitute two parties, namely, a party who say, " There is need, with respect to knowledge of the Creator, let him be exalted ! of a rightful teacher; and the fixing upon him, and the recognition of him, is necessary, first of all, and afterwards nstruction by him;" and a party who take up from a teacher, and from olle who is not a teacher, in every science. * The amount of this article seems to be, that religious instruction is neces- sary, contrary to the doctrine of those nvho hold that GFod is known by mere intellect and specuLltion, because whoever affirms the latter, if he would est;SS lish any definite criterion, must confine it to himself, and in so doing contra- dict his principle, by making circumstances personal to himself, independent of the possession of mere intellect and speculative faculty, requisite to the end. t Exaggerators of ancient authority are here referred to. Esh-Shahra- stiny elsewhere says that they were called Men of tradition, " because their aim is to get traditions, and to hand down accounts, and to base sentences on authorities, and they do not go back to analogy, manifest or hidden, so long as they find an account, or a memorial." See Esh-Shahrastany's Book of Relig. axdPhilos. Sects, ed. Cureton, p. 160. That such a party were wanting in discrimination, as Hasan affirms, may easilv be credited. i: That is to say; the very statement of the latter alternative involves the affirmation of the former.</page><page sequence="13">270 4 And it is clear, by the preceding prenwises, that the truth is with the former party; so that, as for their head, he must needs be the head of those who hold to the truth. And sinee it is clear that Malsehood is with the latter party, their heads, eonsequently, must needs be the heads of those who hold to falsehood.' Says he, ' And this way is that which eauses us to know the plaee o-f truth by the truth, with gen- eral knowledge. Then, after that, we know the truth by the place of truth, with speeial knowledge; so that the rota- tion of questions is not requisite.' And by ' the truth' he here means only the having need ;§ and by ' the plaee of truth,' him who is needed. And says he, ' By the having need we kllow the Imam, and by the Imam we know the measures of the having need; just as by potentiality we know neeessity, that is, the Neeessarily Existing, and by this know the measures of potentiality in things potential.' Says he, ' Anl the way to the profession of unity is, by the measuring of feather by feather, in like manner.'t " WIoreover, he states eertain &amp;rtieles whieh have respect to the eonfirmation of his doetrine, either by way of aecommo- datioll to, or by way of rupture with, reeeived doctrines; and Inost of them are sorne rtlpture or other, and an insist- ing upon, and a clernonstration of, diversity on the ground of falsehood, and agreemeilt on the ground of truth. One of them is the ' Artiele of truth and falsehood, and the little and the great.) H-e states that ' in the world there is a truth and a Malsehood ;' after whieh he states that, ' as for the mark of truth, it is uzaity, and as for the rrlark of falsehood, it is multiplicity; and unity aceompanies instruction, and multi- plicity, opinion; arld instructioll accompanies the forming one party, and the forming one party, the Imam; alad opin- ioll aeeoulpanies diverse parties, whieh aeeompany their heads.' And he lays down truth and falsehood, and ths3 sinzilarity between them, on the one hand, and the differellee betweerl them, on the other hand, the mutual confronting in the two extremes, and the ranking in one of the two estrernes, as a balanee bs- whieh he weighs every thing about whicll he disputes. Says he, ' Xnd I have derived * The lleed of a teacher. t The meaning is, that one comes to the profession of the divine unity, with a full understanding of it, through the Imam, precisely as it is through him that one attains to a complete convictioll of his need of instruction.</page><page sequence="14">271 this balance only from the word of testimony, and its being compounded of denial and affirmation, or denial and excep- tion;' says he, 'so that not that whicll Inerits denial, is falsehoo4; and not that which Irlerits affirmation, is truth. And by that is w-eighed the good and the bad, and the true and the false, and the other opposites.'* And his main point is to come back, as respects every declaration and word [of the Kuran,] to the affirmation of a teacher; and that, as for the profession of unity, it is the profession of unity together with the doctrine of a Prophet, while it is the profession of unity; and that, as for the doctrine of a Prophet, it is the doctrirle of a Prophet together with the doctrine of an Imain, while it is the doctrine of a Prophet.t " This is the end of his svstem. He prohibited comtnon people, however, fronn xneddling with a rnatter of science g and in like manner, people of note, frotn examining the ancient iI3ooks;a: except those who knew the state of the case respecting every Book, and the degree attained by men in every science. And iil respect to points relating to the Deity, he went not with his followers bevorld his say- ing, ' Our Deity is the Deity of Muhammed.' Says he, ' I and you say, that our Deity is the Veity of intellects, thavt is, that that which directs to him is the intellect of every intelli- gent being.' But if it is said to one of them, ' What sayest thou respecting-the Creator,-let him be exalted! as for him, is he? and as for him, is he one, or multiple, pos- sessed of knowledge, powerful, or not ?' this definition alone is givel] for answer, 'MY Deity is the Deity of Alu- hammed; and he it is who sent his Ellvoy with the direc- tion; and as for the Envoy, he is the director to him.' * This " balance," or prillciple of judgment as to the true and the false, the good and the bad, and all opposites, was derived from the fundamental confes- sion of faith among the Muslims, There i.s no l)eity but God, which expresses the truth of the divine unity only as the propositions included in it, namely, There is no I)eity, and God is a Deity, each of which, by itself, may stand either for truth or for falsehood, are taken together as mutually complementary. The general principle may be stated as follows: that what may be affirmed abso- lutely, as between any opposites, consists in the complementary relation to each other of those opposites. + ThLs means, that the declaration There is no Deity bxt God, implies the doctrine of a Prophet to reveal the truth thus expreFed, and that the doe- trine of a Prophet, expressed in the declaration Bullammed i8 his Prophet, implie8 tXlat of an Imam to carry Ox1 the Prophet's work. t The Scriptures of former periods, or previous Divine Revelationsw</page><page sequence="15">272 " And oEcen as 12 have entered into disctlssion with the people, on the ground of the preinises stated, they have not taken a step beyond their saying, '1Iave we then need of thee ?' or ' Shall we hear this froirl thee ?' or ' Shall we be instructed by thee?' And often as I have been concile iating towards the people, respecting the having need, and have said, 'Where is he who is needed? and how deter- mines he for me the points relating to the Deity ? and what is it which he prescribes in respect to things which are ob- jects of the intellect? inasmuch as "the teacher" has no meaning intrinsically, and only has meaning because he teaches; and ye, indeed, shut up the gate of science, and open the gate of submission to dictation, and the following of authority; and an intelligent being is not content to believe a doctrine, without any evidence to rest upon, or to walk in a way, without any proof that he should do so,'- the beginnings of the system have been authorizings to judge, and submissions to authority. ' But not, by thy Lord, not believe will they, until they make thee the 3udge respecting that which is in controversy between them; after which, they will not find, iil their souls, any fault pertain- ing to that which thou determinest; and- they will submit themselves, with submission."' " The Shattyeh.t-These are they who are extravagant in respect to the reality of their Imams, to such a degree that they put them out of the limits of the creature-state, and pronounce bearings of the state of Deity to be in them. For often they lilcen one of their Imams to God; and often they liken God to the creature; and they hold to the two extremes of extravagance and curtailment.: And their assimilations have only grown out of the doctrines of the Incarnationists and the Transmigrationists, and the doc- trines of the Jews and the Christians; inasmuch as the Jews liken the Creator to the creature, and the Christians liken the creature to the Creator; and so these assimilations passed into the minds of the Extravagant Shi'ah, to such a * Kuran, Sur. iv. v. 68.

And the system of the Mu'tazileh pre vailed among the latter, after they saw that it was nearer to that which is objective to the intellect, and farther from anthropomorphism and incarnation. " And the heresies of the Extravagants are comprehended in four things, llamely, anthropomorphism, and the com ing forth, and the return, and transmigration. And there are appellations belonging to thertl; and in every coun- try, they have an appellation.

Now from one of our new documents it appears, that certain Isma'ilian followers of Babek, whose standard of rebellion was iirst raised in Ajerblian took from him the fashion of going abroad in mantles of Yenzen, an article of dress covering the whole person, from the top of the head down; and the class of people there called, from that circumstance, Babeklyeh, may have been the same as those here named.

And so, on account of that, we say that God, let him be exalted! appears in the form of impersonations. And because there is not, after the ErLvoy of God, let the divine benediction and peace be to him ! any impersonation more excellent than 'Aly, let benediction alld peace be to him ! and after him, his appropriated descendants,@ who are the best of creatures, therefore, the true God appears in their form, and speaks with their tongue, and holds with their hands. So then, by virtue of this we generalize the name appropriate to the state of Deity so as to include them. And we affirm this being appropriated of 'Aly, preferably of any one else, only because he had given to him specially an aiding from God,-let him be exalted ! which is something that connects itself with the hidden sense of mysteries. Said the Prophet, --let the divine benediction and peace be to him ! " I judge by the outward, and God has charge of secrets."t And by virtue of this, it was the lot of the Prophet, let the divine benediction and peace be to him ! to fight with polytheists and the lot of 'Aly to fight with^hypocrites. And by vir- tue of this, he likened him to 'Isa Ibn Maryam, and said, "And if men may not have said respecting thee that which they say respecting 'Isa Ibn Wfaryam, have not I, indeed, declared respecting thee with a declaration ?" 't "And often they affirm of him a participation in the en- voyship, inasmuch as he said, ' Among you is one who fights on the ground of its allegorical sense, as I Sght on the ground of its letter; is he not, indeed, the sewer of the sandal ?'§ and so, that the knowledge of the allegorical sense, and the fight- ing with hypocritest and the disputing with the Jinns, and * Appropriated as dwelling-places of the Deity. t A traditionary saying. t A traditionary saying. § Meaning, does he not complete what I begin @ This also is one of the traditionary sayings of the Prophet. 274</page><page sequence="18">275 the removing of the gate of Khaibar, not by corporeal power,@ are the most convincing proof that in him was a divine part, and a sovereign power from the Lord, or that it is he in whose form God appeared, and with whose hand he created, and with whose tongue he comlnanded. And by virtue of thi3, they say, ' He was in existence before the creation of the heavens and the earth; says he, " We were shadows on the right hand of the throne; and so we gave glory, and then the angels gave glory with our giving glory,"-and as for those shadows, and those forms not casting shade, they are real, and shine with shining, by the light of the Lord; which is not cut off from them, whether they are ln this world or in that world. And by virtue of this, 'Aly said, " I am of Ahmed as light of light," mean- ing that there is no distinction between the two lights, except that olle of them precedes, and the second, a corre- late to it, comes oll after it. And this proves a sort of association. " But the Nusairlyeh are more inclined to maintain the divine part; and the Ishaklyeh are more incliiled to main- tain the association in the prophetic office. And they have other disagreements which we shall not mention." " The Bakirtyeh, and the constant Jafartyeh. They are the followers of Abu Ja'far Muharomed Ibn 'Aly El-Bakir, and his son Ja'far Es-Sadik. They declare the imamsizip of both of them, and the imamship of their parent Zein el- 'Xbidin; except that among them are some who are con- stant to one of the two, and forward not the imamship to their descendants, and some who do forward.t And we distinguish this party over and above the sects proMessing to be Shi'ah which we shall mention, only because those of the Shi'ah who are constant to El-Bakir, and declare his return, are in constancy like those [of the Shi'ah] who declare the imamship of Abu 'Abdallah Ja'far Ibn Muharn- med Es-Sadik. * This must refer to some *adition connected with the taSking of Khaibar by Muhammed. t The Ineaning is, that some regard one or the other of the two as the last Imam, to whom the imamship still belongs, although he is for a season with- drawn from human view- while others consider the imamship as the inherit- ance of successive generations in the line o£ his posterity.</page><page sequence="19">276 " And hc was a possessor of rare science in religion, and perfect culture in philosophy, and eonsummate self-restraint in respect to this world, and complete abstinence from appe- tites. Xnd he had dvelt in Medineh a length of time, doing much service to the Shl'ah who sided with him, and comrnitting to those friendly to him the secrets of the seiences; when he entered 'Ira-k, and dwelt there a length of time. He never assumed the imamship, nor contended with any one respecting the khalifship; and whoever plunges into the sea of knowledge, is not eager for a shore; and whoever is elevated to the summit of verity, fears not a letting down; and there is a saying, ' Whoever has eon- verse with God, is empty of men, and whoever cultivates Mamiliarity with others than God, the Tempter makes a ?rey of him.' And he was related, on the father's side, to the stock of prophecy; and on the mother's side, he was related to Abu Bekr, let God be gracious to him ! And he eleared himself of that which any one of the Extravavants had to do with, and cleared himself of him, and cursed them; and lqe was clear of the peeuliarities of the doctrines of the Rafidheh,+ and their fooleries, llame]y, the declaring of the disappearance and the return,: and the coming forth,§ and transrYligration, and ilrcarnatiol1, and anthropomorphism. " But the Shi7ah were divided, after his day, and every one of them professed a doctrine, and desired to pass it off upon his followers, and referred its origin to hirn, and fixed it on him; while the master was clear of that, alrd of the system of the Mu'tazileh,ll and also of the doctrine of the Kadariveh.1r This is his saying respecting volition, namely, 'God,-let him be exalted! wills by us something, and * This i3 probably a traditionary saying of Muhammed. t i. e.

And this is his saying respeeting pre- destination, narrlely, ' It is a thing between two things, not absolutism, and not indifferentism.' And he was wont to say, in prayer, 'O God, to thee belorlgs the praise, if I obey thee; and to thee it belongs to eonviet, if I disobey thee.
