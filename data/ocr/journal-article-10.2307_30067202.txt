<plain_text><page sequence="1">60 MITHRAISM. MITHRAISM. EARLY Christianity waged many campaigns with the State, with creeds and philosophies. But it never entered on a more relentless warfare nor won a more striking victory than when it faced and conquered the power of Mithra. It is only in recent years that archaeology has enabled us to estimate the greatness and extent of that power: in the great cities and tiny hamlets in Italy and the Provinces, along the mighty frontiers of the Rhine and Danube, in the remote valleys of the Alps and Vosges, beneath Hadrian's great rampart where the legionary faced the Caledonian savage, on the shores of the Black Sea, everywhere are found traces of this popular cult, the " cave " of the god, votive inscriptions and other wreckage from the sea of time. In the second millennium B.C. there lived a tribe which may have contained the common ancestors of the Hindu and Iranian races. Such an inference is drawn by scholars from a cuneiform inscription found in the centre of Asia Minor. This inscription mentions as the gods of a common Pantheon the names of Indra, Mithra, Varuna and the NAsatyAs. The first two are common to Iran and India; they are mentioned both in the Avestas and Vedas; the latter two are peculiar to Hindu mythology. Arguments have been drawn from philology to show that the origin of the two nations of India and Persia was due to a religious schism. It is impossible to pierce the veil of time with any certainty; it must suffice to know that Mithra belongs to a very remote antiquity. Whether the Avestas contain the true tradition of this ancient religion in all details is a debatable question; the redaction of these sacred writings dates from the Sassanid, or second Persian Empire founded in 226 B.C. But it seems certain that the position of Mithra in the early Iranian Pantheon-at the time Cyrus conquered the Medes in 560 B.C. and founded the Achaemenid dynasty-was essentially the same as that which was assigned to him in the Avestas. In these writings, which give the official ritual of the later empire, it is Ahura Mazda (Ormazd), the Creator, the God of Goodness, who is the chief figure; he and his archangels</page><page sequence="2">MITHRAISM. 61 (Amesha Spentas) wage an unceasing warfare against Ahriman, the Destroyer, and his demon (devas). In spite of the totemistic and magic elements, and the strongly- developed animism which personifies the elements,' ani- mals, plants, and even the utensils of worship. " Mazdeism, of all ancient religions, is the one that most resembles Judaism in its aversion from asceticism and barren contemplation, as well as in the elevation of its social and per- sonal morality."'' The dualism of the divine powers was to be finally resolved by the victory of Ormazd over Ahriman; a Messiah was to come, as a second Zarathustra, to bring the dead to life; the good were to be separated from the evil; the latter to be punished, but not for ever; in a final conflagration the world was to be purified, and all humanity to unite in adoring Ormazd. In this-the Avesta tradition--Mithra is but a subordinate figure. He is one of the yazatas created by Ormazd. He is, it is true, the Spirit of Light and of Truth, tutelary deity of the warrior, protector of the poor, champion against the powers of darkness, lord of the after world. Even at this early stage Mithra possesses a moral character, as he does in the Vedas. But it is probable that Babylonian influence was the most potent factor in the elevation of Mithra to the central position in the Pantheon. Syncretism, a striking characteristic of Mithraism, then first appeared, nor was it uncongenial to the mixed population and the Achaemenid kings. The astrolatry and mystic numbers of the magi were adopted; Mithra, the god of light, was associated with Shamash, the sun god. This association did not amount to an absolute identification; Mithraism I It was considered the grossest form of impiety to defile the elements-fire, water, earth-in any way; bodies were exposed in solitary placs on towers to be devoured by birds of prey. A mnagu8 would not cross the sea for fear of polluting it. For the infinite number of impurities which a man might commit there were countless expiations and penances; the thousand strokes, for example, for the " murder " of a loach. Such flagellations could be compounded for by fines, or good works, or the destruction of unclean animals such as serpents, frogs and toads. Deatfi was the greatest source of impurity; precautions were taken by extreme unction, pouring the haoma into the ears and mouth of the dying person after he had made a penitential confession; thus the spirits of evil that gathered round a corpse could be driven away.

Then also was formally enunciated for the first time the doctrine of the divinity of kings. It is from Mithra-Shamash that Hvaren6, or the special grace which gives the king victory over his enemies, was derived. The rayed crown of the oriental potentate was but the symbol of this special sanctity. It is by Mithra, as Xenophon shows, that the great kings swore.' From Babylon Mithra advanced over the East, and his first great career of con- quest dates from the downfall of the Persian monarchy. The kings of Pontus, Cappadocia, Armenia, and Com- magene, claiming as they did to be descended from the Achaemenids, loyally espoused the religion of their caste. Mithra advanced with the great Iranian diaspora, making fresh conquests, annexations and alliances. The rites of Cybele, of Attis and Mon, of Jupiter Dolichenus, contri- buted to his ritual Hellenism, placed its philosophy and art at his service. From Attis was borrowed the pine (as symbol of immortality,2 the Phrygian cap and costume, It was in all probability a Pergamene artist who sculptured the archetype of the group known as Mithra Tauroctonus, after the model of the Victory of the temple of Athene- Nik&amp; on the Acropolis. For centuries this group was reproduced in the spelaea in all the countries which the Unconquered One invaded. This was a striking innova- tion on the ancient Iranian theology, which, if we are to believe Herodotus and Strabo, never indulged in any material images of its divine powers.3 Stoicism helped to transform the spirit and systematize the teachings of the new religion; it furnished symbolic interpretations of dogma and traditional beliefs. But the conquest of Asia Minor was but a step to the conquest of the Roman Empire. Plutarch states that the Cilician pirates, con- quered by Pompey in 67 B.C., were devotees of Mithra, and Mithraism may have been introduced into Italy by these captive Cilicians.4 At first the cult of Mithra at Rome seems to have been confined to the humbler classes. Under the Flavians the worship got a firm hold on the capital.

The divinity of the Emperor was a dogma of imperial politics; this and the worship of the Emperor, living and dead, found religious support in Mithraism. The Principate looked with a kindly eye on the new faith. That Nero was not unsympathetic may be inferred from the speech of the Armenian king, who said, " I have come to prostrate myself before Nero, my God, as if before Mithra."' The colossal statue of Apollo-Helios dedicated by Vespasian may have been for the initiated a representa- tion of Mithra-Shamash, the god of the legions which Vespasian had commanded in the East. For, if the Emperors were the patrons, it was the armies which were the chief missionaries of Mithraism. At the second battle of Bedriacum in 69 A.D., the men of the third legion "saluted, as is the custom in Syria, the rising sun."2 So well known was the Mithraism of the eastern armies that this action of a single legion gave rise to the rumour that the Syrian army had arrived. The legio xv. Apollinaris, who had served in Parthia and Judaea, established the cult in Pannonia, first at Carnuntum (Petronell) in 71 A.D., whence it spread quickly through all the Danubic provinces. The two Germanies, especially the agri decumates, and the other provinces, including Britain, were largely affected. Even in those few countries, Africa, Spain and Western Gaul, where the native gods held out against Mithra, we find traces of the worship in the military and commercial centres. Soldiers, officers and privates, were foremost in the work of proselytism, but merchants of Syria, civil servants of the empire, freedmen and slaves, have left monuments of their zeal in spreading this new religion. For Mithra was not only the friend of the king and the warrior, but also the champion of the bond and the poor. Along the great arteries of the empire flowed this new doctrine, stimulating, like its own kaoma, dead souls to a new life. And everywhere the conqueror absorbed largely from the creeds that he con- quered. In the Mithraeum at Ostia Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, and Sylvanus have their niches. If Mithra was the central god of Nature, he was great enough to allow other divinities a delegated sphere of office, a local authority. Like the Emperor, he ruled his 1 Dion Cassius, lxiii. 5. 2Tacitus, Hist. iii. 24.</page><page sequence="5">64 MITHRAISM. empire with legati and Arocuratores. The philosophy and esoteric cults of the day found him equally accomnm- dating. Neo-platonic mysticism arid demonology found their teaching confirmed by the Mithraic " fathers." Finally the Principate adopted Mithraism as the official cult, and almost all nations prostrated themselves before the Invincible God. It is extremely difficult to give a succinct and connected account of the doctrines and rites of Mithraism. Ancient writers give but meagre details, and their statements can- not always be regarded as unbiased. Such knowledge as we have has been pieced together by modern scholars, chiefly from the comparative study of Mithraic sculptures. The intricacy of the subject is largely due to the all- embracing syncretism which characterized the cult from the days when Mithra was first associated with Shamash in Babylon; and this fusion of Aryan Mazdeism with the creed of semitic Babylon was the first of a series of simi- lar absorptions; Mithra threatened finally to enmesh or sublate (if this Hegelian term may be used) all local and national rites and religions. And this character made Mithraism easier of acceptance; the convert did not lose his traditional religion altogether; he refound it-at least partially-in Mithraism, offen refined in form, if not with a more spiritual meaning. Still in all this fusion and accretion of heterogeneous dogma, the central idea remained the same. Mithra the Mediator and Giver of Life, the Source of Light and Truth, was the sun around which the spiritual universe turned. The empire was but an ectype of this heavenly kingdom, and the Emperor the human incarnation of Mithra-Shamash. To the mind of the ordinary man, in the first four centuries of the Christian era, such a conception must have appealed most forcibly. At the head of the Mithraic Pantheon was Infinite Time (Zervan-Akarana) properly nameless, but, to satisfy the desire of the vulgar mind, he was styled by the equated titles of Atnov-Saeculum, and Kpdvos-Saturnus, the latter term being regarded as synonymous with the Greek word Xpovov. He is imaged as a winged, lion-headed figure, around whose body is coiled a serpent. In his hands are some- times the thunderbolt and sceptre, sometimes the two keys of heaven. His r61e resembled that of</page><page sequence="6">MITHRAISM. 65 Destiny. From this First Cause arose the whole universe by a series of emanations. First came Heaven and Earth; from their union sprang Ocean. These three formed the supreme triad and the vulgar assimilated them to Jupiter (Caelus, Zei), Juno and Neptunus. From Caelus and Juno were sprung the other and lesser divinities, who were styled by Graeco-Roman names, but the initiated adored under these names the attendants of Mithra; Hercules was Verethraghna or Victory; Vulcan was Atar, the Fire-Spirit; Bacchus was the Haoma or Water of Life personified. These deities dwell with Jupiter in the Kingdom of Light, over against which, in the depths of the earth, was the Kingdom of Darkness, where Ahriman (Arimanius, Pluto), another emanation from Cronus, ruled with Hecat&amp; over the host of demons. Like the Titans, these latter spirits had essayed to storm Heaven. Foiled by the bolts of Jupiter, but not utterly crushed, they still had power to plague man- kind. The initiated could, by incantation and other magic, avert their malice, or command their services. But naturalism and astrolatry were potent influences in Mithraism. The former element was derived from Iranian, the latter chiefly from Babylonian theology. The elements were regarded as divine powers; to the unceas- ing conflict of these with one another are due all physical phenomena. Monuments frequently exhibit a group com- posed of a lion, a mixing-bowl (crater), and a serpent. This group symbolized the struggle of fire, water and earth. In this conception of the war of the elements has been seen traces of the theories of the Greek cosmologists. Astrolatry, with its attendant astrology, encroached at times even on the central figure; in the latest stages of Mithraism we see signs that the Triple Mithra was re- garded only as a symbol of the rising, mid-day, and setting sun. Astrology, that imposture which, under the empire, was always being banished and always returned,1 sheltered itself often in the sanctuary of the Deus Invictus; we find such epitaphs as 8ACERDOS DEI SOLIS INVICTI MITHRAE STUDIOSUS ASTROLOGIAE. In its latter days Mithraism was found in still more questionable company; the Great Mother was closely associated with the Invincible God, and the hideous 1 Tacitus, Hist. i. 22. E</page><page sequence="7">66 MITHRAISM. taurobolium was a cherished feature in the worship of the Phrygian goddess. The legend of Mithra is depicted in the bas-reliefs found in his temples; these sculptures form a regular series, beginning with the birth of the God, and conclud- ing with the sacrifice of the Bull. In the first of these monuments, the god is seen springing from the rock, the petra genetrix which was an object of adoration to his believers. M. Cumont holds that this represented originr ally a conception of the light pouring from the sky, the latter being regarded as a solid hemisphere. But this conception was enlarged and embellished, and the divine birth was depicted as taking place by the banks of a river; the god springs forth, armed with a knife, and holding a torch; shepherds, who have witnessed this birth from their hiding-place, approach with offerings. On other monuments, we see Mithra gathering from the Sacred Tree leaves to clothe himself and fruit for food. He shoots an arrow against a rock, and a stream gushes forth (M. Cumont says that this conception may have been evolved from the spectacle of the sun's rays piercing rain-clouds). The principal scenes are those of the Sun and the Bull. The alliance with the Sun is de- picted; Mithra invests Shamash with a crown of rays. At the end of the terrestrial mission, Mithra is seen at a ban- quet with the Sun and his other companions; this was the event which the initiated commemorated by their Holy Feast. Then we see the ascension of the Invincible God; Mithra is borne in the chariot of the Sun over the ocean upwards to the heavenly spheres. But the most prominent position in these sculptures is occupied by the Bull. Mazdeism had attributed special importance to this animal, and regarded him as the first of the creations of Ahura Mazda. In Babylon there was also a Bull-god (Ninib). Perhaps the sanctity of the Bull is to be explained by the honour in which that animal would be held by a pastoral people. M. Reinach says,' 1 The sacrifice of the bull seems to indicate that the worship of Mithra under the most ancient form was that of a Sacred Bull assimilated to the Sun, which was immolated as a god, its flesh and blood being consumed in a communion meal. Mithra, the slayer of the Bull, was the result of a duplication common to all religions which have passed from totemism to anthropomorphism. 1 P. 6o.</page><page sequence="8">MITHRAISM. 67 It was the Bull in the Mithra-legend that seemed to the ordinary man to justify some connexion of the tauro- bolium with the rites of the god. The first of these scenes was known as the Transitus. In it; Mithra cap- tures the Bull and drags it by its hind legs to the cave; the analogy of the Hercules-Cacus myth procured for the Persian god the title, flovKKd0rr9o OeS. Then the raven, the messenger of the Sun, brings from his master the command to slay the Bull. Mithra pierces its flank, and from the ground, drenched with its blood, spring all forms of vegetation; from the seed of the Bull are generated all the races of animals. Its spirit is guarded by Mithra's faithful dog, and becomes the tutelary deity of herds. The scorpion and the serpent, emissaries of Ahriman, seek to frustrate this great act of creation by drinking up the sacramental blood. Two dadophori, Cautes and Cautopates, one with a raised, the other with a lowered torch, stand close to Mithra, and symbolize the two worlds of Darkness and Light, and are seemingly identified sometimes with the central figure.' By this sacrifice Mithra becomes the creator of all terrestrial life. After his ascension he continues his beneficence; he is the Omnipotent Protector who champions his creatures in their struggle against the power of Ahriman and his host. He inspires them with truth, and the spirit of justice and morality; he enables them to overcome the baser prompt- ings of the demons of the evil one. After death, it was Mithra before whom the souls appeared for judgement; it was by him also that the souls of the faithful were guided to the Kingdom of Light. Souls, as they descended to earth and terrestrial existence, had drawn from the seven planets as they passed various qualities and faculties; now, guided back again by Mithra on their upward jour- ney, they divest themselves of their earthly feelings and I M. Cumont (p. i68) has endeavoured to reconstruct from the scenes of the Mithraic monuments the missing part of the story. The earth was first plagued with drought, which was ended by the miracle of the stream that Mithra's arrow caused to gush from the rock. Afterwards came a plague of fire and deluge. The Divine Bull, emanated from Kronos, and destined to be the source of all terrestrial life, escapes the plague and deluge. It is depicted in a kind of stable floating over the waters. Then a figure, seemingly that of Mithra, is seen attempting to set fire to the stable with a blazing torch, and the Bull escapes to land.</page><page sequence="9">68 MITHRAISM. passions, and resign their borrowed attributes to the several planets to whom they belong. To the moon they resign their vital and procreative forces; to Mercury, their desires; to Venus, their erotic passions; to the sun, their mortal understanding; to Mars, their instinct for war; to Jupiter, their ambitions, and to Saturn, their habits of indolence.1 Then, as pure spirits, cleansed from all sin and taint of sense, they enter by the gate of Capricorn into the eighth heaven, there to enjoy in the Eternal Light a felicity without end. Mithra is thus the judge and mediator; and he is also the Eternal Father who wel- comes his faithful children after their long wanderings.2 This doctrine of a felicity, conditional on sublimation of all that seemed essential to the notion of happiness, may have been somewhat hard for the ordinary mind to com- prehend. There was, however, another belief, a more comfortable and acceptable promise for the vulgar. The struggle between the forces of good and evil was not to be eternal. When the cycles assigned by Kronos had passed, the end of the world would be presaged by plagues sent by Ahriman. A wondrous bull would again appear on earth; Mithra would descend and call the dead to life. All would arise from their graves, assume their wonted shape and recognize one another. Humanity would be assembled, and the good separated from the wicked by the God of Truth. Then the supreme sacri- fice of the Bull would be accomplished; its blood, mingled with its fat, would be offered to the just ones, and they would acquire immortality from this haoma. Jupiter- Oromasdes, at the prayer cdf the just, would cause fire to fall from heaven to consume the wicked. The Spirit of Darkness would be finally crushed: Ahriman and his demons would perish in this universal conflagration, and the universe would enjoy eternal and perfect felicity. Thus Mithra, the conqueror of evil, was also the con- queror of death. Well might his votaries term him the Invincible God, and less adequate creeds yield to his power. 1 This abandonment of earthly passions and vanities may have been prefigured in the ceremonial of initiation; the soldier, for example, refused the crown offered to him on the sword to signify that he possessed henceforward an incorruptible crown. The seven degrees of initiation clearly correspond to the seven planets. 2 Cumont, i. 310, v. 3.</page><page sequence="10">MITHRAISM. 69 Initiation into the Mithraic mysteries ensured happi- ness, here and hereafter for the initiated. The initiated (sacrati) had different hierarchic ranks-the Raven (Corax), the Hidden One, the Soldier, the Lion, the Persian, the Courier of the Sun, the final stage being that of Father (pater). The local patres were under the charge of a pater patrumin or pater patratus. To-the inferior degrees (Servitors) even children were admitted. The cere- mony of initiation was styled "the Oath" (Sacramentum), no doubt from the analogy to the mode of admission into the imperial army and the oath of loyalty administered on such occasions. The candidate took an oath never to reveal the secrets and mysteries of the cult. He also took special pledges according to the several degrees To the candidate for the degree of Miles, for example, was pre- sented a crown across a sword; this he waved aside, say- ing, " Mithra is my crown"; henceforward, such a man never wore a crown or wreath even at banquets,1 and refused such crowns as he might be offered as a reward for military prowess; he would say, " The crown belongs to my God-to the Invincible God." The candidates dressed and acted in character. " Some," we are told, " flap wings like birds, and imitate the voice of a raven; others roar like lions." The Hidden One (Crypkzos) wore a veil, the Persian a Phrygian cap, the Raven and Lion wore masks to represent the heads of those animals. To pass from one rank to another, the candidate had to undergo ordeals, sometimes of a very alarming character. In some cases the eyes were bandaged and the hands bound, and a trench full of water had to be jumped. The initiations comprised baptism, total or partial. The fore- head of the Miles was "sealed" apparently with a hot iron (the KOav1UELas FVTLKaS, to which St. Gregory refers).3 Purifications by honey were reserved for the Lions and Persians. The Lion was the symbol of the Primal Fire; water, as the enemy of fire, was consequently eschewed 1 Tertullian, from whom this information comes (De corona I5), considered the symbolic presentation of the sword and crown as a caricature cf martyrdom (mimus martyrii). Christians, as well as the followers of Mithra, refused to wear crowns and wreaths at entertainments. The crown was for them the emblem of victory in the battle of life; it belonged pre-eminently to the Christ. See Cumont, p. 319, n. 2. 2 Aug. Quaest. 114. 3 Greg. Nazian. Ad'v. Jul., i. 70.</page><page sequence="11">70 MITHRAISM. in this case. Honey, produced by lunar influence, had wondrous virtue; it was preservative against moral and physical decay. In the ancient Mazdean office, the cele- brant consecrated bread and water; with the latter was mingled the juice of the mystic haoma. The ancient usage was observed in the Mithraic service, excepting that wine was substituted for the haoma, which was a plant unknown in the West. The initiated were permitted to par- take of this mystic meal only after a long noviciate-first probably when the degree of Lion was attained. Hence the initiated were divided into two classes, "Servitors" (below the Lion degree), and " Participants." This is the rite which the apologists compared to the Christian Eucharist. It is depicted on an existing bas-relief. Two persons are seen reclining on a cushioned couch. In front of them is a tripod with four small loaves marked with a cross. Around the communicants are attendants of different degrees, each in his appropriate dress. A Persian presents a drinking-horn (rkyton), and one of the com- municants holds another. From the participation of this mystic meal were to be derived physical and moral bless- ing, spiritual wisdom and power to combat the forces of evil, as well as eternal life. Before admission to this agape the candidate was tested and prepared in the ways men- tioned above. Sometimes, it seems, he had to take part, as spectator or actor, at a mimic murder; this points, no doubt, to a primitive rite of human sacrifice. Many of the enormities described by Christian critics-savage tortures, mutilations, orgiastic abominations--had their founda- tion in the garbled accounts of these ordeals. The object was, professedly, to test the candidate's moral strength; the Mithraic ideal was the stoic insensibility (&amp;nrdeOa.) The candidate was to show himself "pure of heart, and unaffected by things of sense."' Legend told how Zarathustra first consecrated to Mithra in the heart of the mountains of Persia a cave "wherein flowers blossomed and water flowed."2 Hence the followers of Mithra sought, where it was possible, to establish their sanctuaries in natural caves, or at least among rocky surroundings, preferably where there was a spring or stream. When such features were wanting, as in cities, they built their Mithraea underground. The 1 Nonnus, quoted by Cumont, ii. 27. 3 Porph., De antro Nymph., 5.</page><page sequence="12">MITHRAISM. 71 term applied to such temples was "The Cave or Grotto " (spelaeum, spelunca, specus, antrum). Into this temple the votary descended from a vestibule or pronaos. The feel- ings of the neophyte must have been profoundly affected as he passed down into the cave, lit at first, no doubt, only by the gleam from the eternal fire on the altar, which stood in front of the shrine where the sacred sculp- tures were placed. In the dim light he could discern the forms of the worshippers, strangely prostrated in adora- tion.' Strange sounds were heard, unearthly music, terrify- ing flashes of light as the celebrants suddenly fanned the altar fires. He caught glimpses of the monstrous shapes and mystic symbols whereof the meaning was still hidden from him. Kronos vomited flames from his lion-jaws. The alarming trials, the solemn obligations, the ancient oriental ritual, contributed to excite the candidate's imagination and feelings to an acute pitch. Then came the revealing of the mysteries to the accepted candidate. Lamps blazed up in front of the apse; the litanies were chanted. At the climax of the rites, a bell sounded, and the veil was drawn, revealing the Holy Scenes. In some temples the slab turned on a pivot so as to exhibit and conceal alternately the sculptures carved on either side. When the mystic cup was drunk, and the compelling invo- cations recited, it was little wonder that, in such sur- roundings, with his senses stimulated to an ecstatic inten- sity, the communicant had a vision as of things divine- that he departed from the spelaeum filled with a new and wondrous joy. The traditions of the Mithraic ceremonial were care- fully guarded by a priesthood (ordo sace-rdotum). These were, no doubt, originally oriental magi; but we have no evidence to show how they were recruited or organized at a later period. Tertullian speaks of a "high pontiff" (summus pontifex), who could marry only once.2 The r1le of this priesthood was an important one. On the priest devolved the administration of the sacraments and the celebration of the offices. He presided over the initiation, saw that the holy fire burned continually on the altar. Thrice daily he recited the ancient litanies to the Svn, turning at dawn to the east, at noon towards the south, 1 The customary posture in prayer in the Graeco-Roman religions was standing. 'De praeser. haeret. 40.</page><page sequence="13">72 MITHRAISM. and at evening towards the west. There were numerous sacrifices and rites of a special character. Clad in distinc- tive vestments, he sacrificed to the various gods of the upper and lower worlds, letting the blood flow into a trench cut in the stone; or he made libations, holding in his hands the magic bundle of wands (called the Bares- mdn). He invoked the planets, worshipping each in its special place (or chapel) in the temple and on its special day. Sunday, over which the Sun presided, was especially sacred. Probably the sixteenth day of each month was sacred in the West, as it had been in the East, to Mithra. The great Persian festival, the Mithrakana, on Mithra's day in Mithra's month (viz., the 16th day of the seventh month-October 2nd), became under the Roman Empire the great Feast of the Sun's rebirth (Natalis Invincti) on the 25th day of December. The equinoxes were also ob- served, and initiations took place as a rule towards the end of spring, in March or April; Christians, it will be remembered, desired to admit catechumens especially dur- ing the period of the Pasch. To obtain a legal status, the Mithraic brotherhood formed themselves, like the votaries of Isis and other cults, into guilds (collegia). They could pass in the eyes of the law as funerary societies. These guilds had the usual officers, councillors (decemviri), yearly presidents, treasurers (curatores), legal advisers, and patrons. They derived great support from the association of Mithra with Cybele, for the worship of the Magna Mater was sanc- tioned by the Roman State in the time of the Republic.' The guilds depended on private subscriptions to defray their expenses; the site for the Mithraeum was usually 1 In another way, this connection with the Great Mother was useful to the Mithraic congregations. Mithraism in the West, it seems, did not accord much recognition to women; consequently the close association of the two religions was desirable, enabling, as it did, the female members of a household to attend the rites of Magna Mater, while the men folk found spiritual help in the mysteries of Mithra. The temples of the two cults were often contiguous. The matres and sorores of the Magna Mater formed a pendant to the patres and fratres of Mithra. In the East Mithraism was not so exclusive, and women were admitted to the inferior degrees. Still this oriental attitude towards women-an attitude which at best seemed to indicate only con- temptuous toleration-when contrasted with that of the Christian Church, must have weakened seriously the appeal of Mithraism for the sympathy and support of humanity.</page><page sequence="14">MITHRAISM. 73 given by some generous patron. Their congregations were small; when a "brotherhood " increased largely it divided, and a new Mithraeum was established. Such, in bare outline, was the religion which Chris- tianity denounced--Christianity which condemned poly- theism, denied the divinity of Emperors, and looked askance at military service. Nor was the struggle less bitter because of the many analogies and similarities of Mithraic to Christian belief and usage. Mithra, the God of Light, of Truth, and Purity, the Giver of Immor- tal Life, the Redeemer of the World by a mystic sacrifice; Mithra, whose code of morality was almost as austere as that of Christianity; the analogies of baptism, conse- crated water, " sealing" of disciples; the renunciation of self imposed upon the believer; the fact that men and women had vowed themselves to continence in the service of the Persian God,' the terms " brethren" and " father " with which the initiated addressed one another; the doc- trine of the resurrection of the dead, and the final judge- ment, of the ultimate conquest of the powers of evil and the destruction of the world by fire; all these features evoked the wrath of the Fathers of the Christian Church. But it was for the Mithraic communion that their fiercest denunciations were reserved. Mithraism to them appeared a horrid mockery, a parody of their most sacred beliefs and usages. " They are the artifices of the Devil," cries Tertullian; "his work it is to pervert the truth, to imi- tate in his idolatrous mysteries the rites of the holy sacraments."2 The Mithraic communion, savys Justin Martyr, is a caricature devised by evil spirits." Nor would the attitude of the Mithraic apologists be one likely to conciliate the sympathies of the Christians. " It seems probable," says M. Cumont, " that they sought to set off the life of Mithra as a pendant to the life of our Lord; the disciples of the magi wished to contrast the adoration of the shepherds, the agape, the accessories of the Mithraic story with the account of the Evangelists. The rock, the petra genetrix, which had given birth to the Spirit of Light, was compared with the rock, the emblem of Christ, on which the Church was built; the cave wherein the Bull died, with that where- in Jesus was born in Bethlehem. But this parallelism could end only in caricature. It was a serious mark of inferiority in 1 Tertullian, I.c. 2 i.c. Apolog. i. 66.</page><page sequence="15">74 MITHRAISM. Mazdeism that its belief was only in a mythical redeemer, and the never-ceasing fount of religious emotion that gushes forth from the teaching and suffering of the God sacrificed on the cross, has never flowed for the faithful of Mithra." Many of these analogies may be explained by the oriental origin common to both religions; still, Christianity may have been affected to some degree by the usages and phraseology of the rival ritual. Even after the downfall of Mithraism, it was difficult to shake off its habits and traditions. In the fifth century not only heretics but even faithful Christians could still turn towards the sun and murmur, " Have mercy on us." It seems fairly probable that the commemoration of our Lord's Nativity was assigned to the 25th of December, because that day was the feast of the birthday of the Invincible God. But it must be remembered that it is dangerous to press the question of similitude and analogy. Similarities, especially of phrase and metaphor, may well be pur- posive. There are many passages in the Holy Scriptures which seem to contain allusions, but allusions coupled with dignified rebuke, to the pretensions of Mithraism and its god. Christ is the "Light of the World," the " Sun of Righteousness," and Christians are the "children of the Light," who walk in the Light. The soldiers of Christ, clad in the whole armour of God, "the armour of Light" and of Righteousness, are to fight against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. The soldiers of Christ can reject in their daily 1.fe, as firmly as the Mithraic " sol- diers " rejected in pantomime, an earthly crown, and hope for an incorruptible one. But it is not Christian literature only that contains echoes of Mithraism; in the domain of art the early Christian sculptors were slow to free them- selves from the designs and models of their Mithraic predecessors. If has often been asked why Mithraism escaped the per- secutions and proscriptions which were directed against other cults and religions. The answer is simple. The teachings of Mithraism were congenial to the spirit of the Principate. The divinity of the Emperor found in it a spiritual justification; the HvarenB became officially acceptable as the Fortuna Augusti. The Emperor, pius 1i. 34I.</page><page sequence="16">MITHRAISM. 75 felix, invictus, became the human symbol of the Sol Invic.tus. The miracles of healing performed by the touch of Vespasian at Alexandria, though done in the name of the local deity, show how popular imagination had fas- tened on this divine power in monarchs. Particularly acceptable Mithraism must have been to the dynasty of Syrian emperors commencing with Severus (193 A.D.). And there was a more potent protector than the Emperor in the armies. The year 69 A.D. showed that it was the voice of the armies which would determine who should be Lord of the State. It was unlikely that these would tolerate any interference with their beloved religion; it was, on the other hand, not unlikely that the imperial countenance was not unconnected with a desire to stand well with the legionaries. Still it was deep in the heart of man that Mithraism had its real hold. It had many meanings and appealed to all classes-cultured and uncultured, civilian and soldier, prince and slave. It was the greatest effort of paganism to adapt itself to the heightened moral consciousness of man; it was an unceasing syncretic movement to absorb and trans- form classic theology, nature worship, mystic symbolism, into a co-ordinated and almost monotheistic religion wherein every spiritual desire would be satisfied, every doubt resolved. In it nature-worship was purged from its grosser accretions. The sun was an acceptable symbol for the philosopher of moral and transcendental excellence; for the politician it was a symbol of the absolute monarch. But the moral teaching-that it would be well ultimately with the good, that there was a life beyond the grave for which we could form ourselves-must have been welcome indeed to the immense mass of the weary and heavy-laden slaves and toilers of those early centuries. " The powers of Mithra in the fourth century lay in the fact that while it was tender and tolerant to the old national wor- ships, and never broke with the inner spirit of heathenism, it created an all-embracing system which rose above all national barriers, which satisfied the philosophic thought of the age in its mysticism, and gave comfort and a hope of immortality through its sacraments,'1 The stronghold of the Mithraic cult was the army; this faith, in consequence, flourished most vigorously along the frontiers of the empire. But the Barbarian inroads, coupled with the loss of Dacia and the agri decumates, 1 Dill, p. 586.</page><page sequence="17">76 MITHRAISM. were heavy blows. The conversion of Constantine to Christianity clipped the wings of the ambitions which the favour of his predecessors had fostered. Under Con- stantine the cult was tolerated, but it could not afford to attract public attention too much. A votary complained in tones of bitter irony that, under this Emperor, it was not safe to look at the sunrise or sunset, that farmers and sailors did not venture to observe the stars.' Julian's apostasy rekindled the fires of Mithraism. At Alexandria the mob rose against the Christians when the latter desired to build a church on the site of a ruined Mithraeum; the patriarch was torn from the prison, where he had been lodged by the magistrates, and suffered a cruel martyrdom on the 24th of December, 361 A.D., on the eve of the birthday of the "Invincible God." But this revival of the cult was only ephemeral. Attacks came again from all sides. Sometimes, to save their shrine from pollution, the Mithraic "fathers" walled up the entrances; sometimes, as at Osterburken, the sacred sculptures were hidden away carefully in the hope that the storm was only a passing one. But such hopes were ill- founded. The Christians and Barbarians alike vented their fury on the Mithraea. Sometimes the Christians, in order to pollute the shrine beyond expiation, killed the priest by his own altar. At Rome in 377 A.D. the prefect Gracchus, as a proof of his sincerity, "overthrew, broke down, and utterly destroyed " a shrine of Mithra, and de- manded Christian baptism.2 Finally, on the accession of Theodosius in 394 A.D., the Persian god was banished for ever from Rome. His power was gone; although for some time still the cult lingered on in the provinces, especially in the East. But for Mithra himself the torch was lowered, the sun was set; henceforth he was to be descried dimly, a giant figure in that twilight where the dead gods abide. Still Mithraic ideas, incorporated in Manicheeism, sur- vived when the religion was dead; and perhaps in the prac- tices of mediaeval astrology may be found the last traces of a cult which at one time was professed by half the Roman world.
