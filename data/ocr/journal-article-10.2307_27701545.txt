<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEATRICAL ANALOGY RECONSIDERED Richard Dewey University of New Hampshire Some years ago I rejected out of hand a sociologist colleague's argument that the use of analogies or models is characteristic of insecure individuals operating in im mature disciplines. The ready rejection was prompted by my frequent use of, and affection for, analogies in writing, in teaching, and in oral argumentation. How ever, more than a decade has passed since I first listened to this critique of analogies, and I have not been able to persuade myself that my rejection was logically justi fied. Until recently, nevertheless, I drifted with the tide of fashion, seriously questioning neither my continuing use of analogies in general, nor my assiduous elaboration of the theatrical model in particular. This comfortable mental state was rudely, if advertently, disrupted recently as a consequence of my reviewing for a sociological journal a book on role theory (Preiss and Ehrlich, 1966J.1 The obligation of taking a hard look at the authors' serious attempts to delimit the boundaries of role analysis, and to specify "... a program for the construction of role theory," led logically, as it turned out, to taking an equally hard look at the functional aspects of all analogical models, but with special at tention to the theatrical or dramaturgical concepts as applied to socio-cultural data. This paper essays an ex planation that justifies a reversal of judgment concerning the utility of analogies in sociology and social psy chology. It is well to recognize, before continuing with the case against analogical analysis of sociological data, that only an extremist would argue that the very persis tence of a conceptual scheme is an argument for its functional nature. Such persistence can be explained by subjective rewards for those who expound the utility of analogies that are quite independent of the objective value of analogies. In addition to the enticement of the game aspect of thinking up clever likenesses between one's own data and other categories of experience, there are the rewarding feelings of security that accompany the juxtaposition of the familiar with the novel, of an idea, especially a new one, with an analogue that is well known to both the user and those addressed. The reality of these rewards makes it difficult for those employing an analogy to discern whether it has actual heuristic pedagogical value or its continued use is merely a func tion of rationalization designed to preserve these sub 1 Reviewed in Social Forces. This is a carefully executed study of a state police system in terms of expectations, perceived expec tations, and actual on-the-job performances. I concluded in my review that the value of the study, and its conclusions, were in no way dependent upon the use of the concept "role," or its related "theory." November, 1969 jective rewards. Moreover, tradition honors the practice of analogical reasoning. Criticisms of anthropomorphism, probably the earliest kind of analogy or model, by Xenophanes, Plato, and the writers of the Greek Penta teuch did not eliminate its use. Despite the disdain that most scientists show for anthropomorphism, the heritage of the ancients is still perceptible in the attribution of man form to the forces of good and evil as God and Devil. Nevertheless, despite occasional aberrations, pur suers of knowledge were persuaded by the accumulation of knowledge over the centuries to reverse the direction of the analogies from the homocentric beginnings, and at tempts to perceive their data objectively led the model builders logically to the perception of man in terms of nonhuman models. Although not unknown in earlier periods of time, mechanistic models or analogies became much more prevalent in the seventeenth century in response to the remarkable gains of the period in mechanics, physics, and mathematics. Sorokin (1928, 1966), among others, has given detailed attention to this development. The popularity of such model making persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; one of the most extreme instances is found in Carey's Principles of Social Science (1858), where the model seems to ap proach a homology rather than remaining mere analogy. Too, we recall that Comte would have used the title "social physics" had not Adolph Quetelet pre-empted that term for his own efforts at understanding human behavior. However, despite the persistence of this physi cal-mechanical model, as evidenced by such concepts as inertia, dimension, fusion, stratification, and equilibrium in the writings of current social scientists, it gave way to a newer emphasis upon biological-organic models. This was, of course, a reflection of the gains in biological sciences in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which were comparable to those in the physical sciences in the seventeenth century. Thus we again see the sociological (sociology of knowledge) explanation of the analogical sociological theories (if "theories" is not too grandiose a term for the attempts to conceive of social relations in terms of the organic model). Spencer shared with Lilien feld, Schaffle, Worms, and No vico w, and later Gumplo wicz and Ratzenhofer, the pursuit of explanations of society in organic-biological terms, and this heritage is revealed in the continued use of biology-based words, the most pervasive of which is organic. Because of their closer approximation to the social order, the organic analogies have proved to be more persistent and pervasive than their physical-mechanical counterparts in social science literature. Yet they yielded their dominant position to another analogical model, 307</page><page sequence="2">the adoption of which is once again explained by the increased sophistication of the social scientists. The analogy that the current model-making (I perceive the process as invention rather than discovery) sociologists and social psychologists have resorted to is, of course, that of the theater. Because it is a cultural product, the dramaturgical model requires much less distortion to make it fit the human condition. Nevertheless, it is still simply analogical, and it still entails the application of words and concepts designed for one set of restricted relationships to significantly different and more ex pansive sets of relationships. The theater is not the equivalent of society, and therefore the application of the dramaturgical analogies is just another instance of reductionism in conceptualization of societal phenomena, and so carries with it some of the same limitations that beset the earlier noncultural analogies or models. Among the problems raised by the use of analogies is making clear to the reader or listener just how the "Among the problems raised by the use of analogies is making clear to the reader or listener just how the analogue in question (a mechanical, organic, or theatrical system) is, or is not, like the social-cultural counterpart." analogue in question (a mechanical, organic, or theatri cal system) ?5, or ?5 not9 like the social-cultural counter part. The expositors of earlier models spent considerable time trying to do this. In retrospect, it seems clear that the time and energy directed toward explaining and justifying the use of analogies would have yielded more understanding if given to direct explanation in terms more clearly relevant and applicable to the data of sociology or social psychology. For example, Durk heim's "mechanical" and "organic" solidarity analogies added little, if anything, to the understanding of the sociological data in question. In fact, after using these terms in the classroom for more than a quarter of a century, I am now convinced that their use obfuscates rather than elucidates the intended perceptions. It is of some interest to note that over the centuries during which analogical models of various sorts were invented, the expositors themselves became more critical in sub sequent re-examinations of their analogies, claiming less applicability than they had in the initial presenta tions. A second problem is deciding which is the independent and which the dependent analogue. Uncritical readers and listeners are likely, the evidence appears to suggest, to take too literally the nature of the simulated relationship and to focus attention upon the nonsocietal factors in their attempts to understand by deduction the more pervasive societal relationships. To the extent that the analogue differs significantly from the socio-cultural system under scrutiny, the conclusions are apt to be unwarranted, with both conceptions and perceptions distorted. This seems to have happened in the case of uncritical interpretations of interpersonal and societal 308 relationships in terms of the theatrical model where selective perception of the real data is dictated by the restrictive model. This model-dictated selectivity is also seen in the subhuman conceptualization of man in Lorenz's On Aggression and Ardrey's Territorial Im perative. Even awareness on the part of the analogy's inventor of significant dissimilarities between the object of study and the model is not sufficient to preclude the overly literal application of the model. George Herbert Mead (1934:161) was explicit about such differences, yet this did not stay the uncritical application of "role" in the perception of nontheatrical relationships. In his words, "The latter phrase [taking the role of the other] is a little unfortunate because it suggests an actor's attitude which is actually more sophisticated than that which is involved in our own experience." It is of some interest to note that, with the increasing popularity of the dramaturgical vocabulary as applied to both large and small groups, return to at least a nominal anthropomor phism is frequently evidenced by such phrases as "the role played by urbanization" and "the role of chromo somes in development" in the current literature of several academic disciplines.2 Anyone who has occasion to survey carefully the uses made of the term "role" in sociological and social psychological literature can attest to the absence of con sensus as to its referents, and to its confusion with such words as "position," "role-behavior," "status," or simply "behavior." Rare indeed is the writer who uses "role" unambiguously.3 It is not at all unknown for sociologists and social psychologists to use "role" in several distinct meanings within a single chapter, in fact at times within the same paragraph. Most commonly, the writers are unsure whether one plays a role, occupies a role, or sees in role the expected behavior or the actual behavior. Some of this confusion is attributable to the fact that the term "position," which is always normative in its denotations, is often used but rarely defined. Further, it is at least plausible that the confusion in meanings is a consequence, in part at least, of the dual meanings of the term that are probably inevitable under present conditions, namely, the denotation of the make believe actions, on the one hand, and the "for real" be havior of the man in the street, on the other. There appears to be some cogency in the suggestion that the word, drawn out of the original context of the theater, has been mis taken for the concept it is supposed to symbolize, with the result that the larger societal relationships have been mis perceived as more "make-believe" than they in fact are. That this tendency is abetted by the cynicism bred of vulgarization of Freudian theory is readily granted. The temptation to remark that "the cultural script has set the stage for just such role-behavior" is difficult to resist. This is not, of course, to argue that all acting, all make-believe, is restricted to the theater, although the 2 Cf. Nash, for a defense of the use of metaphors in social sci ence, but also for an acknowledgement of the dangers involved. 3 For detailed examples of the multi-meanings attached to "role," see Dewey and Humber (1966:281-283). The American Sociologist</page><page sequence="3">degree to which everyday life is pretense is highly debatable. A man of the theater, and not a sociologist or a social psychologist as such, displays for us his per ception of the actual social world as essentially "make believe," a perception apparently shared by some social scientists (Evreinoff, 1967:64-65): The important thing is to realize that at least three fourths of our life are spent in an imaginary world. Then we shall realize also that the "theater in the abstract" dominates everything; and that the population of our planet is governed not by democracies, aristocracies, autocracies or plutocracies but by a theatrocracy. This is the only lasting "regime," which stands above all political regimes, which reveals itself in all political regimes, which can be overthrown by no revolution and which will survive all evolutions. In order to understand that this is neither a "fa?on de parler" nor an exaggeration, try to subtract from your life the hours when you are attitudinizing and playing parts, or watching others attitudinize and play parts. Subtract, if you can, the hours when you see in your thoughts the realization of some hope which is yet to be realized or the vague recollection of some forgotten hap pening. Eliminate dreams, those fantastically mystical pantomines, where the author and the spectator are fused in your subconscious ego. Eliminate the theatrical cere monial of life: the hours of play in your childhood, past and present, the time spent in imitating your friends or simulating their peculiarities, the nights at the theater which you began to visit long since, or your reminiscences of such nights. Eliminate the hours you spent reading plays and novels, which are nothing but a drama unfolded before you in the pages of a book. . . . Nay, eliminate from your life the hours when you play the hypocrite, the moments when you act in keeping with the rules and conventions of polite society, the long succession of hours when you display the good manners of a gentleman; eliminate all that, and you will understand how ridiculously little is left to the nontheatrical side of life. You will understand that you are really a faithful sub ject of the universal theatrocracy, and you will agree that your life is a continuous theatrical performance. The main thing for us is not to be ourselves. This is the theatrical imperative of our souls.4 Much earlier, similar perceptions, or misperceptions, were attributed to Erasmus (1941:37) : Now what else is the whole life of mortals but a sort of comedy, in which the various actors, disguised by vari ous costumes and masks, walk on and play each one his part, until the manager waves them off the stage? More over, this manager frequently bids the same actor go back in a different costume, so that he who has but lately played the king in scarlet now acts the flunkey in patched clothes. The overplaying of the "world as theater" by social scientists, and the misperceiving of all members of society as dramatis personae, appear to be functions of 4 Somewhat the same flavor is provided in such writings as Goff man (1959) and, to a lesser degree, Strauss (1959). It is easier to subscribe to this viewpoint in large cities than in rural areas, the "masks" being more difficult to penetrate in the conditions of urban anonymity. the too-literal interpretation of the language of the theater. One need not subscribe to the linguistic rela tivism of Sapir or Whorf to understand the possibility that this vocabulary (the human drama, stage, backstage, audience, actor, cultural script, role, role-playing role taking, and so on) directs our attention to the literal theater and away from the larger society, with its heady mixture of playing-for-keeps with no subtle, latent mean ings or motives, and the deliberate presentation of a false front, with all that play acting entails. Unless one is prepared thus to argue that all except an insignificantly small part of human intercourse is literally play acting, there is another price paid by social scientists for the use of the analogies of the theater, namely, we are no longer equipped with a denotatively specific vocabulary with which to distinguish this phony, false, make-believe behavior when it occurs outside of theaters, movies, and radio and TV studios. One can grant both Evreinoff's and Erasmus's points in significant measure and still assert that there are important differences between the theater and the larger society. Rather, simply because there is so much play acting in everyday life, we need a vocabulary to denote "In retrospect, it seems clear that the time and energy directed toward explaining and justifying the use of analogies would have yielded more understanding if given to direct explanation in terms more clearly relevant and applicable to the data of sociology or social psychology." it, and until it was pre-empted and distorted for pur poses of analogous reasoning on such a wide scale, the vocabulary of the theater was exactly the kind of language we needed for the description of this play acting, this make-believe, whether witting or unwitting.5 Our only hope for recapturing this valuable language for its proper use lies in a rejection of it as a substitute for basic sociological and social-psychological conceptual symbols. Despite the immensity of this task, the al ternative of inventing a new vocabulary to designate theatrical phenomena per se appears to be much the more difficult, and much less likely to be effected. Whereas the earlier mechanical and biological models may well have served a necessary, if temporary, purpose at a time when social-cultural relationships were widely conceived as being extra-natural, the dramaturgical analogies do not appear to have this warrant or any comparable warrant to support their current exposition. To be convinced that the expansive use of the word "role" is superfluous, sometimes distortive, and often contrived, one has but to omit the word "role," or the phrase "the role of," from passages selected at random from social science literature to discover that this often changes the meaning not at all, and on occasion clarifies it. 5 Cf. Messinger et al. (1962) for a careful delineation of the areas of "real" life to which the dramaturgical approach is logi cally applicable. Mead, himself, of course, used "role" in this way, especially with reference to the behavior of children (1934:139). November, 1969 309</page><page sequence="4">Further evidence lies in the superfluous listings in library card catalogs with the dispensable phrase, "The role of . . ." prefixed to substantive topic headings of many kinds, ranging from the physical sciences, through busi ness and recreation, to the social sciences. It is to the substantive headings that one must turn when using card catalogs; nothing of value to the library would be lost if these "role" cards were discarded. It has been suggested that our current preference for nouns over adjectives or verbs may explain the popularity of the term "role." In any event, the con trived nature of its application is demonstrated by the very real fact, noted above, that after more than a third of a century of intensive use of the term "role," social scientists cannot agree as to its meaning. This is ac knowledged by the editors of the most recent compilation of articles intended to clarify the meaning of the term "Anyone who has occasion to survey carefully the uses made of the term 'role9 in sociological and social-psychological literature can attest to the absence of consensus as to its referents, and to its confusion with such words as 'position,9 'role-behavior,9 'status,9 or simply 'behavior.9 (Biddle and Thomas, eds., 1966), yet in the articles themselves there is the continuation of the confusion of meanings that has persisted since the introduction of the word into serious literature in the 1930's. Even among writers who pay careful attention to semantics, "role" is assigned more than a single meaning. Compare its use to denote (1) actual behavior in a social system, (2) a synonym for social "position," and (3) an equiva lent for "norms" (in Parsons et al., eds., 1961:42-^3). Furthermore, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to identify a single significant idea in sociology or social psychology that owes its origin and development to the "role" con cept, nor indeed to any of the terms borrowed from the theater.6 What we have described in the metaphors of the theater we could, I am firmly convinced, have described and analyzed more clearly using other words, restricting the use of "role," "stage," and so on, to real-life situa tions where make-believe is clearly indicated. The wide spread popularity of the theatrical model has encouraged what William Bruce Cameron has called a "theory of con cepts," rather than fruitful theories about human be havior. 6 One recent article seems to credit dramaturgical social psychol ogy for the fact that ". . . the differentiation between individual and group behavior does not have currency as a working distinc tion," and for placing emphasis" ... on interaction, not on the characteristics (be these individual or group) of the actors" (Bris sett, 1968:72). Surely, this view of the individual and the group, and the emphasis upon interaction, pre-dates current writings on dramaturgical social psychology. This emerges from the writings of Mead, Cooley, and others and was perhaps most clearly spelled out in the less well-known writings of L. Guy Brown, published from 1934 to the present time. The ideal of "one word, one meaning; and one mean ing, one word," given voice by Ralph Borsodi, must still be a goal for any area of study that justifies the designa tion of discipline. The unclear thinking that emerges from the equally muddled meanings of such words as "role," "position," and "status" will disappear only when the social sciences have matured sufficiently to employ or in vent words with specific denotative reference, and to stop borrowing, and distorting, symbols and concepts that were invented for denotation of significantly dif ferent referents. To illustrate, it can be argued that there is need for a word to denote the actual behavior of the incumbent of a social position or status in a social system, as contrasted with the expected behavior in terms of which the position or status is defined, but that our willingness to "make do" with "role" or "role behavior" has been instrumental in our failure to invent an appropriate designation. When we have acquired a confidence, born of knowledge about the data of sociology and social psychology, that precludes the felt need to borrow surety and prestige from other vocabu laries, even for heuristic pedagogical purposes, the use of analogical models will disappear from the classroom and the literature. Then dramaturgical analysis and description, as analogy, will follow the mechanistic and organic models into the pages of histories of social thought, bereft of all but historical relevance for sociology and social psychology, and another phase of the trial and-error development of the social sciences will have been completed. In view, however, of the pervasive use of models in current literature in general, and in particular of the dramaturgical analogy, which is very much "in" with social scientists and "hip" laymen alike, it must be con cluded that a sanguine attitude toward the early abandon ment of these status- and security-giving devices, either by professionals or laymen, is unwarranted. A recent column in a Boston newspaper was captioned by the enigmatic phrase, "Russell Plays Celtic Role" which meant, one discovered only by reading the text, that player-manager Bill Russell had signed his contract with the Boston Celtics basketball team. We readily perceive in this use of the term that "role" is fashionable with the fourth estate, but we appear to be less able to recognize that sociologists and social psychologists, being human, are also subject to the coercion of fashions. Nevertheless, if we sociologists and social psychologists are to surmount this and other semantic "hang-ups," we must be vigilant in our self-examination and be ready to recognize a sociological fashion for what it really is, and to accept its abandonment in due time without regret. rences Biddle, Bruce J., and Edwin J.
