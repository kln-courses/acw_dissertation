Canberra, Australian Na tional University Press, 1984. x, 194pp., plates, maps. Price AS12.00 (paper). Michael D. Myers University of Auckland This book purports to be a culture contact history of Tanna, an island of Vanuatu, and examines the first century of contact between Europeans and the Tannese. It is based on Adams' Ph.D. thesis which he completed in 1977 at La Trobe University, Melbourne. The author draws mostly on published and un published historical documents in Australia, Britain and New Zealand, and travelled to Tanna in search of further information. Unfortunately, Adams tells us very little about his research on Tanna. The idealist theoretical perspective of Adams is soon revealed. According to Adams, the first century of contact between Europeans and the people of Tanna was characterised by mutual misunderstanding, distrust and hostility, with each side attempting to control the other. He says that the missionaries, and the Rev. John G. Paton in particular, are worthy of special attention because "they stand as a paradigm example of the characteristic European attempt to dominate and control not only the Tannese and the Pacific Islander, but the whole of the non European world" (p.3). Mission history and the early history of colonialism is thus reduced to being a kind of out-growth of the European personality. In a similar way, Adams says that the Tannese tried to appropriate the European, but then he takes this idea one step further. "Even into the twentieth century, with most of the island nominally Christian and seemingly under strict missionary con trol, the Tannese were still in charge of their own destiny" (p.3). Obviously, Adams has forgotten that the Condominium was established in 1906. For Adams, early contact history is best seen in terms of culture. Each aspect of Tannese culture had its function but Europeans did not understand this. In his discussion of gift exchange, for example, Adams says that, "What all the missionaries failed to understand was that feasts, as exchange rituals, were impor tant in maintaining political networks, activating and confirming alliances between individuals and groups" (p.9). This functionalist defence of a reified Tannese culture is applied indiscriminately, even to cannibalism and warfare. What Europeans misunderstood about cannibalism was that there were never more than 28 families with the right to eat human flesh. The exchange of dead bodies was a means of establishing and confirming alliances (p. 10). Adams is forced to gloss over the contradiction between his functionalist interpretation of warfare and the changing reality of Tannese society in the 19th century ? there 77</page><page sequence="2">78 REVIEWS was, as Adams himself notes, a shift in the balance of power on Tanna after the introduction of muskets (p.36). Adams charges the early missionaries with having caricatures of the Tannese (pp.14, 18) but Adams proceeds to create his own. Firstly, he focuses almost exclusively on the Rev. John G. Paton as if Paton was a typical missionary. Yet Paton was, by all accounts, most extraordinary. Secondly, he says that the early missionaries saw the Tannese as depraved. But while this is certainly true as a generalisation, Adams fails to mention that "total depravity" is one of the cardinal doctrines of Reformed theology. This doctrine was applied to Europeans also. To imply that the missionaries' view of the Tannese was peculiar to the culture contact situation is thus false. Adams also fails to see that this doctrine did not mean that the Tannese were not capable of social good. Elsewhere Adams says that the missionaries perceived the giving of gifts by the Tannese as "an unconnected series of kindly gestures" (p.60). It is precisely an issue such as this which highlights the weaknesses in Adams' approach. Adams claims he is examining culture and the culture contact situa tion, but in actuality the approach is at once a sympathetic understanding of the non-Christian Tannese and a very unsympathetic understanding of the missionaries and the Christian Tannese (who, according to Adams, were not real Christians anyway). I am not suggesting that the early missionaries did not misinterpret Tannese culture, but I am suggesting that Adams, as a cultural relativist, is not very consistent. His reverence for the world-view of the non Christian Tannese ? the examination of which is sometimes excellent ? contrasts with his mocking attitude to the world-view and theology of the missionaries. Furthermore, one wonders at times if Adams has really understood much of Reformed theology. For example, he erroneously describes Paton's ideology as "Manichean" (p.84). In short, I believe that Adams, instead of attempting to portray the real nature of the world-view of the missionaries, has only tried to make that world-view seem ridiculous. Adams proceeds to examine in depth Paton's childhood and early adulthood, as if this explains Paton's theology and his actions as a missionary in Tanna. Undoubtedly Paton's childhood is interesting in itself, but Adams largely ignores other factors which influenced Paton's actions, such as the political structure of the mission and the relationship of Paton to the sending churches in the metropolitan countries. At one point Adams argues that Paton's conception of God was only an extension of his earthly father-figure. "Reading his later correspondence from the mission field, one is struck by his anthropomorphic image of God, witnessing their actions and understanding their innermost thoughts" (p.81). Surely, this "anthropomorphic image of God" is no different from the image which all Christians have. To claim that this image is somehow related to Paton's father-figure is, frankly, absurd. Adams questions the credibility of Paton as a witness on Tanna (p.35) and virtually suggests that none of the attempts on Paton's life were serious (p.111). While I agree that Paton's hair-raising accounts probably were embellished, I cannot agree that these accounts should be reduced to the status of Paton's "sym</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 79 bolic imagination". The early history of mission work in Tanna would suggest otherwise (Miller 1978:35ff.). Throughout this book, then, the explanation of events is almost always in terms of cultural misunderstanding. But did Europeans and Tannese always misunderstand each other? Should we accept Adams' assumption that none of the Tannese became real Christians ? that Tannese prayers to Jehovah were simply an extension of the traditional ritual propitiation of Tannese deities (p. 137)? Moreover, is the history of culture contact in Tanna really characterised by minor misunderstandings and personal clashes based on ignorance of the other's intention, as Adams maintains (p. 122)? I believe that a history of Tanna which examines the transformation of Tannese society brought about by contact, and which looks at these changes in the light of wider political, economic and in stitutional factors, still remains to be written. Towards the end of this book, Adams, almost in spite of his ideal typical approach, begins to look at some of the differences and disagreements between the missionaries and broadens his focus to include the relationships of the missionaries to the churches in the metropolitan countries. It is a pity that these complexities in "missionary culture" were not introduced earlier and dealt with in a more substantial way. REFERENCES Miller, J. Graham, 1978. Live, Book I.
