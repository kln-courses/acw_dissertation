The Museum of Natural History Dublin as material culture BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB</page><page sequence="2">In July 2007, the dramatic collapse of a section of a nine teenth-century limestone staircase in a restricted rear area of the Natural History Museum Dublin forced the closure of the building, which has been unavailable to the public since. It appears that the Museum will remain closed until at least 2010, due to a significant programme of examination, repair and refurbishment, making this an ideal moment to reflect on the Museum as an aspect of Irish culture.1 The issue of change is at the heart of casual conversation about the Museum and its future - the 'Dead Zoo' inspires strong loyalties as a unique component of national patrimony. The idea that this Museum will emerge from its refurbishment fundamentally changed is distressing to those who love it the way it is. At the time of writing, the Natural History Museum is preparing to undergo its most significant set of changes in over 100 years; not since the Dublin Science and Art Museums Act of 1877 has it been the subject of such an intensive level of official attention. A set of truisms has grown up around the Natural History Museum Dublin over the 150 years it has resided in its current quarters, centring around the notion that the Museum is an eternal evocation of Victorian science and its priorities, providing us with an intact view of the past, unchanged since its establishment. However, when the Royal Dublin Society opened the doors of its new Natural History Museum in 1857, the ground floor was unfinished and the inaugural exhibition on the first floor comprised of plants, crustaceans, molluscs, fossils, birds, butterflies and ethnographic materials from the South Sea Islands.2 Entered through Royal Dublin Society headquarters at Leinster House, the Museum was accessed through a long curved corridor connecting the buildings. Clearly, this is not the Museum we see today. Issues of change surrounded the Museum in its early years, as some of its basic purposes and needs were unmet from the start. The building remained unfinished for many years; an article from the Irish Times in 1862 laments: The beautiful new Museum of Natural History - erected partly by Government and partly by subscription of the members of the [Royal Dublin] Society - has been almost in a state of abeyance for some years, for want of funds to complete the internal arrangements, and to classify and place in cases the magnificent collection now in possession of the Society.3 In 1877 a major set of changes took place as Parliament forged an agreement with the RDS to transfer the collections to state control, and the Museum became part of a national museums framework under direct funding control from London. Organising and classifying the collections had still not been addressed by 1884, when Alfred Cort Haddon,4 working in an advisory capacity, wrote an eight-page set of recommendations for finally cataloguing, labelling and storing the collection according to sound taxonomic principles. Haddon's advice appears to have been implemented just in time for everything to be thrown into disarray in 1922, when Leinster House was appropriated for use by the new government, causing problems of storage and space which continued far into the future. Events in the outside world also took their toll on the Museum; archival sources indicate a marked slowdown in activity during World War I, and certainly in the turbulent years following as Ireland divided, and was itself reformulated as a changed entity. The period of genteel fixity we now associate with the Museum appears to have begun in 1922, as the new state was struggling to establish itself and the Natural History Museum was simply not a priority. Dail debates on the National Museums refer to the state of neglect into which the Museums overall had fallen, with natural history cited in particular: In the department of natural history things seem to be worse. As far as I can make out, there has been no keeper since 1924 and there has been no assistant keeper since 1921. ... I think that the Dail owes something to the Museum. We could not have come into being, I think, if we had not acted the cuckoo and crept into the Museum nest.5 Records of Dail debates on the topic since largely reflect a history of underfunding and indifference, which appears to be finally at an end as planning for renovations commences. Regarding issues of change, the Natural History Museum takes on interesting dimensions when considered as material culture. Seen as an object in a broad sense, its uses over its lifetime reflect changing circumstances and priorities. As a repository for knowledge and culture, the Museum and its collections have been employed to varying purposes over time. The architecture, specimens, letters and images associated with the Museum evince a rich system of exploration and communication which seek to locate Ireland within wider debates and events, while defining and cataloguing the island's natural resources. These goals were addressed as much through visual means as language, with representations playing a substantive role in the Museum's objectives. The ways that the organisation has been conceived and used over time gives it dimension and meaning in both the cultural and social senses. 43</page><page sequence="3">44 In 1857, it was a venue for serious amateurs to establish their reputations, share their findings and exhibit the specimens they had collected. With the Museum as its nexus, a network of knowledge and communication developed, its membership defined by class and social parameters; the core participants were overwhelmingly from Ascendancy backgrounds and unionist in their politics.6 Dilettantes from the same set of networks also contributed, sending back items for the collection from travels abroad or from military service, generally in the colonies. While the primary contributors to the Museum were a self-selected group, they extended their work into the broader culture by way of public talks and travelling education programmes, as well as opening the Museum to the public. These activities seem to have been severely curtailed after 1922, with the Museum lapsing into relative stasis through underfunding, perhaps due as much to its social and political makeup as to the strains on the new state's resources. The 1990s saw a resurgence in the popularity of the Natural History Museum, as it became apparent that the decades of neglect had an unexpected benefit. Around the world, the modernisation of natural history museums had largely erased their origins, and the intact cabinet museum became an endangered species - Dublin possessed one by default. Its uses since have shifted accordingly, and it has become, as is often repeated, 'a museum of a museum.' As such, it attracts visitors by the score each day, and is heavily used as a venue for education, regularly teeming with schoolchildren. Because its original priorities, to the modern eye, seem odd or even perverse, it has become attractive to artists who fall prey to its eccentric charms, and it has been used in this regard by established practitioners such as Dorothy Cross and Karl Grimes, as well as drawing and design students from second- and third-level programmes. Science is still an active concern, as UCD's partnership programme in collections-based biology utilises the collections for learning, contributing to ongoing issues of organisation and preservation. The notion of public participation, though not an overt goal of its founders, has been a strong influence in the Museum's history. While the men of science in the Victorian era had a rationale and set of networks for using the Museum as venue for research and exchange among themselves, some of the more interesting aspects of the Museum revolve around its uses by the general public. There is a sense of 'interactivity' in the ways that members of the public correspond with it as the scientific establishment of record, and the archives are full of letters which indicate a sense of the complex roles it has filled through the years. Nineteenth-century science was heavily reliant on far-flung networks of amateurs, as they became eyes and ears of the scientific establishment, collecting specimens and reporting sightings, imparting information from the margins to the centre. The most famous and well documented example is Richard Barrington's network of lighthouse keepers, who sent him the wings and legs of birds killed when they struck the lights; this long-term study provided valuable information on migration patterns for Irish coastlines. Similar activities take place on a smaller scale as well, with members of the public communicating with the Museum for all sorts of reasons. A sampling of the correspondence for 1900 alone indicates the range of exchanges. Mr Hynes writes, offering two live otters and asking what the Museum would pay. Lord Lismore's estate, upon his death, seeks to sell two fine mounted tigers. The Church of Ireland Training College and the Queen's College Galway both express thanks for loans of specimens from the collections for their science programmes. Mr Wyler offers an egg which, when opened, had another entirely intact egg within - he says: "It is a Curiosity and not to be found Everyday." Lady Longford seeks the identity of the unusual insects she's found, sending them along for good measure. A farmer offers a four-legged duckling, two legs of which the farm cat has regrettably eaten. Mr Orr, formerly a lecturer in architecture at the RDS drawing school and now living in Northumberland, seeks an identification for an unusual stone he's found, his letter accompanied by a gorgeous little drawing. The Museum itself is in contact with the Imperial Institute in London, seeking specimens from the colonies to fill gaps in the collections.7 Despite early perceptions of exclusivity, the Museum has long been the authority of first instance for any and all queries to do with the natural world, a trend that continues today. This ongoing tradition of use means that a strong proprietary sense pervades public attitudes to this Museum. Aspects of the Natural History Museum reflect other conditions, sometimes unwittingly mirroring larger cultural assumptions. The Irish mammals on the ground floor provide an interesting case in point. Natural history museums in general were founded to amass the diversity of life, as completely as possible, in one place for education and study. The accepted style of mounting the animals for these aims was largely utilitarian, so that all aspects of form, size and colouring could be studied and compared with other specimens. Each specimen, while rendered as lifelike as possible, was meant to stand as an objective visual representation of the species at large. The taxidermists with whom the Museum worked, such as the Williams family of Dame Street or Rowland Ward of London, also mounted specimens for private display in homes or public spaces such as clubs and pubs. The styles of mounting for domestic display exhibited a more vernacular visual language, employing anthropomorphic overtones or referring to prevailing notions of aesthetic beauty.</page><page sequence="4">BMM^^''- ^ 'jB^^^^^^^^Hp'- / jOj^KU^^^^^YT__^__^__| ^? ~"?*? r .^^K^^KKM^KkMm^^^ ]2__?_a?^-3_5_H_H_H_^_^ft1_|_^_^_^_B __B_^HR__^__^__^_BllJ^^HHfi t^y' ^s^^^^^^^^^^^SSS^^BP^^^^^K^^^Ss^^^^^KKm^^^^^^^^SS^^^ ^"^^RifS^^^B -^b^bH^b^b^b^DBHSbkIBI^b^bI^b^b^b^^ ^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B^^^^^^^^^^B^Vi^^_|i_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_H '?bVbV_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_H B^B^HBBHI^B^B^B^B^B^B^BHnHi^B^B^B^Bl^B^B^BlH &amp; #3_t'' i's/T) iR"^n_, li^l 1 jB_b_b*__.^^^^P^Mb^h^^-.-2^T*JbYbYb^vbYbYbYbYbYbYbYbYJ _K^-_ ^1 ' ' -*%rZzJ r ll ' MMi: i'"TlfezX^_1 "'^^BwB^bVBMBBV *E^^^Z^ WtltW*-- ^^|__g_gjBjBMBBBB_- __fl__^K_jj__H__^__ " ^"bmII JLf 3 %1^K^9IbbUbbbhbiHb^bbbbVHI^^b^bbb HMHB^BV^I-B^BVBVBVBVBVeTBK-^BVBV^^^^Ir^?!^ 5y_^___BWB?

'Family' groupings with anthropomorphic overtones are clearly visible, with the animals demonstrating the characteristics of cohesive nuclear families. The bulk of these cases date from 1910 to 1913, so were apparently linked by an internal rationale. The Irish badgers, for example, are ensconced in a beautiful, spacious case, arranged as though occupying their native habitat and representing parent animals and their young. The baby badgers play and tumble over the prone form of their indulgent mother, a scene reminiscent of Greuze's sentimental print The Beloved mother of 1769. Inside the den/ home, the female/ mother keeps order, cares for and trains the babies; outside the den, the male/ father keeps watch, assuming an attitude of protection and fierce paternal care. The visual language of domestic taxidermy intended for private consumption blurs here into scientific representation. This blending of popular narratives with the priorities of natural history would not have been lost on the Museum visitors, and serves to naturalise the prevailing domestic arrangements of the day by describing them through scientific means.8 The sudden appearance of this set of conventions into a scientific context, during a period of social and political unrest, is evocative and begs deeper analysis than is possible here. "The significance of a collected object does not inhere in the specimen itself, but is socially and theoretically constructed. ... A given specimen functions differently in a biodiversity exhibit than it does in a taxonomy exhibit."9 To this may be added that specimens also function according to systems of local and national reference, as ways of remembering, or as manifestations of social networks and ways of seeing the world. The collection may be argued to have a 'social life' in the material culture sense, in that the specimens and the structures they inhabit have been used in various ways to formulate and articulate various ways of seeing or understanding. Those modes are diverse; the collections variously represent a point of view on the structure of the natural world, may be used to represent colonial power relationships, or to evoke a sense of the past for subsequent generations. The changes in the way specimens are conceptualised reflect changes of priority in other arenas - the tiger, for instance, has been seen in a number of ways: as a token representative of its species, as an illustration of imperial attitudes to colonial populations and more recently as an invocation of the reckless pursuits which have pushed the cats to the edge of extinction. The changes in public attitudes toward the issue of extinction itself have changed the way we see the contents of the Museum; the disappearance of predators such as wolves and golden eagles from the island was once lauded as an accomplishment, and is now largely lamented as a diminishment of the island's natural diversity. According to records in newspapers, photographs and archives, the collection over the years has changed, moved, grown and shrunk; the building itself has been unfinished, finished, appropriated, curtailed and resurrected. We have changed radically in the ways that we think about the natural world, the ways that we use the Museum, and the city itself has changed utterly. What then, in the case of this refurbishment, constitutes authenticity? The vagaries of the Museum's history make this a complex issue, and it seems that the intact Victorian institution we know and love may be more mythological than we prefer to imagine. Roland Barthes's assertion that myth is pure matter plus ideology is more than apt here - the fixed matter of the collections has shifted through several kinds of meaning by virtue of the ideologies through which it has been framed. That the state is finally willing to give this Museum its due can only be seen as progress, as the building and its contents are in serious need of conservation and attention. Presently, the staff have already begun cleaning the specimens and cases en masse, an impossibility in an open, working museum. To really have 'a museum of a museum', provisions for visitors must be improved, accessibility issues tackled and necessary renovations undertaken. Once again, a change in the overall nature of the state signals a change in this institution; Tiger Ireland may preserve and cherish this intact bit of the Lion's Ireland. When the process is complete, the rare Victorian gem should be in perfect nick for the first time in its history.

The government are again 'playing the cuckoo'; the past history of its appropriation of Museum spaces gives cause for concern. Leinster House itself once housed exhibition spaces. The curved corridor connecting the buildings, a now demolished annexe and Leinster Lawn have all been 'temporarily' occupied by the central government, with the promise of return or recompense. Should this plan go ahead, it may be some considerable time before the public again has access to the Natural History Museum. 2 C E O'Riordan, The Natural History Museum Dublin, The National Museum of Ireland, nd p 21 3 Irish Times, 24 September 1862 4 Haddon spent time in Dublin as a working zoologist before departing for the Torres Straits to commence research in what would later be established as the held of ethnography, which he was influential in pioneering. 5 Ernest Henry Alton, Dail Eireann - Volume 29, 17 April 1929.
