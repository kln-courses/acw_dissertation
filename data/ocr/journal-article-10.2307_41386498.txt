<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evelyn Goodenough Pitcher Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study Tufts University Medford, Massachusetts Values and Issues in Young Children's Literature It is rewarding to consider in some general ways how and why children's lit- erature is different from adult literature. A difference perhaps too obvious to mention is the relatively more simple form, plot and language. There is usually quick action, an uncomplicated, episodic plot; endings are sudden, descriptions are sparse. Repeti- tive oral formulae are popular, particularly for quite young children. How Children s Literature Differs Such adaptations in levels of organiza- tion show that, contrary to several cen- turies ago, we realize that children are not just small adults, but that they have differ- ent developmental levels of understanding, interest, and ability. We are also aware now that children perceive the environment in quite different ways from the ways adults view it. At the pre-school and early school level, children tend to a certain animism, seeing nature in anthropomorphic or per- sonal terms. Children's literature, therefore, rarely has a theme reflecting impersonal, or causal, forces. We need to know what children's personal concerns are likely to be and how they may differ from those of adults. The literature is different also in that it does not deal with large social issues or a complicated society. Although there is a laudable trend to introduce Negro children and urban life into literature, such charac- ters and environments are home-oriented. The books present social roles that are easily understood, such as those of garbage man, fireman, cowboy, nurse, king, princess, mother, or father. The social group most attractive and comprehensible to children is the family. Indeed, even when books may be allegedly or superficially dealing with a wider society, they probably do not move far from the home front in their communi- cations to young children. ะก haracterization Another difference arises with regard to complexity of characterization. Although certain characters, such as Mr. Badger in Wind in the Willows briefly and sym- bolically represent recognizable psycholog- ical types, it is not likely that children fully appreciate Badger's satirical prototype of a gentleman of course manners, high po- sition, and kind heart. In general, charac- ters (from adult standards) are "flat" be- cause children themselves are not suffi- ciently aware of inner differentiation of psy- chological traits to appreciate complexity of psyche. Themes The matter of themes is more difficult to interpret, and often misunderstood. Al- though stories for children sometimes pre- 287</page><page sequence="2">288 Elementary English sent themes seemingly suitable and popular in adult literature, such as war and death and various aspects of ethics or morality, it is unlikely that the themes have the same impact on children as on their elders. Death and warfare are forms of aggression, and as such are also favorite themes. Children are fascinated by what is good and what is bad, and seek constant interpretations of these values. Yet they really come to grips with morality in simple black or white terms. (I shall return to this idea in more detail later). But the impact of such themes is highly personal, understood in a child- like way. Children take from their reading only as much as they can receive. Matters beyond their own experience or receptivity are not likely to affect them deeply. First I would like to consider what I will label generally as themes of "catastrophe." War and death, hurt and misfortune, various kinds of injury are alluring in that they present themes emotionally meaningful to children to which they seem to respond with more enthusiasm than to a fact-setting story. We can understand this more when we realize how insecure young children are, how mysterious and threatening the out- side non-family world can be, and how important their own physical intactness is. Children have an avid interest in stories where characters fall and get hurt and band-aids have to be applied or doctors summoned. The story of Johnny's visit to the doctor, with the exciting shot in the arm, brings rapt attention. Nebraska Curriculum "A Curriculum for English,"1 presented by the University of Nebraska suggests four structural motifs of children's literature which are related to the child's sense of insecurity and his sense of family and other than family: "(1) a small person's journey from home to isolation away from home; (2) a small person's or a hero's journey from home to confrontation with a monster; (3) a helpless figure's rescue from a harsh home and the miraculous creation of a secure home; and (4) a conflict between a wise beast and a foolish beast. The family unit and the home are described as ultimately good, even if, as in (3) above, it may not be so originally for a small hero. That terrors lurk outside the home in many stories- wolves, tigers, the "dread of the forest"- may reflect the mystery of the tech- nologically-oriented outside world for the child." Three books that are currently popular with pre-schoolers deal in various ways with the motifs described above: Curious George , Harry the Dirty Dog, The Story of Ping. All such motifs seem to me to re- flect stage-crucial problems in a young child's life dealing with his initial and basic sense of insecurity, both physical and emotional, and his battle with issues of independence and dependence. Erik Erik- son has demonstrated the importance of these issues in the psycho-social develop- ment of children.2 Another motif, getting knowledge, building skills, relates to the issue of industry versus inferiority. This theme is particularly appealing to children 5-8, as is the next theme, that of identity- a finding one's role or place in society. Needless to say, older children do not give up their interest in themes of security and independence, and many younger children begin reaching out in interest toward themes more absorbing to older children. Children Tell Stories: Analysis of Fantasy A project at Bank Street College, re- ported as "The Story Reader as Teacher"3 revealed the greater interest of a group of 1 "Curriculum for English, (A)", University of Nebraska Press, 1966, p. 18. - Childhood and Society , Erik Erikson, Norton, 1950. 3"The Story Reader as Teacher," NAEYC JOUR- NAL , October 1966.</page><page sequence="3">Values and Issues in Young Children's Literature 289 young children in stories that involved themes in what was termed "stage crucial" emotional problems, personally meaningful and understandable. A detailed and docu- mented study of the relevance of some crucial issues in development that seem to appear in stories young children make up themselves is presented in my book, Chil- dren Tell Stories: An Analysis of Fantasy.4 I was prompted to make such a study, inspired by an awareness of some conscien- tious educators toward certain kinds of lit- erature and fantasy. Fairy-tales, Bible stories, even Mother Goose were considered unfit and psychologically damaging. Was it right to give children notions of boys drowning kittens in wells, birds plucking off noses, dogs suffering pangs of unrequited hunger, boys made of sticks and stones and puppy-dog bones? What is the value of reading of wicked stepmothers who are often witches; is it not dangerous to offer children themes based on deceit, betrayal, hypocrisy, and threats of devouring or dire death in wolves, bears, dragons, and malevolent fairies? Would a child project personal abandonment into the story of Moses in the bulrushes? Tales of battles such as those of David and Goliath, the seige of Jericho, Gideons defeat of the Midianites seemed but to foster savage aggressiveness in the young child. So I tried to get some answers from children themselves, children between the ages of two through five in a nursery school where I was teaching. I asked them to tell me a story and I recorded and analyzed the stories thus told, assuming that the kind of story they remembered, the sort of theme most dominant would suggest important in- terest and concerns. Many of the stories ini- tially offered were a complete or partial telling of a fairy tale, a story of cowboys or Indians remembered from television, or a recital of some Mother Goose . Favorite tales were Hansel and Gretei, Red Riding Hood , Three Little Pigs, Three Bears, Three Billie Goats Gruff. Almost every child of four and five knows these tales and would rank them on his best seller list. Basic con- cerns I have already mentioned- those of security and independence, are incorporated into these tales of strong drama, action, vitality, daring, aggressiveness, suffering. Forces of evil (threats from outside) are usually overcome by forces of good (the home, the individual of physical and emo- tional integrity ) . The children also told some original stories, and I collected and analyzed 360 of these. They represented many categories: realistic and fantastic, humorous and dull, dramatic and humdrum. Most surprising, however, was to see the predominance of themes of aggression, involving violence and death and catastrophe, involving hurt and misfortune. Sometimes the aggressions ended in the healing touch or band-aids of the mother; sometimes simply, like Hamlet, in all the characters being killed. Sometimes there were episodic recitals of calamities, with no particular resolution. Here are some examples of such stories from children of two, three, and four. Ulf S. 2:10. "I hurt my leg and I tell my mommy. I got a scratch and she put band-aid on it. And I put band-aid on my hand. And I went on a good truck ride. I fall down in the truck, and the car run over me. And I hurt myself in the street, and it was a bone. I got in the truck and the man shut the door so I won't fall out the truck. And then I bumped my head in the truck. Then I ride in the airplane and go to my grandpa." Colin M. 4:11. "Once upon a time there was a man and a typewriter (pronounced typawriter). And then you know something? The man always wanted to type it. One day this lady came and wanted to type 4 Children Tell Stories: An Analysis of Fantasy , Evelyn Goodenough Pitcher and Ernst Prelinger, International Universities Press, 1963.</page><page sequence="4">290 Elementary English it. And then the man said, "Mrs. Lady, don't type this typewriter." And then the lady just pushed the man down and typed the typewriter. And then the man pushed the lady off the chair she was typing on. And then the man typed what he wanted. And then you know something? The lady got up and when the man started to put his finger on the button she pushed one of the buttons that the man didn't want on there. And then the man got angry at the lady and the lady got a stick and whipped the man and then the man got a sword and then the lady got a sword and they both got two baskets to put over their faces and they both had a sword fight. And then the lady killed the man with her sword. And that's all of that story." How Do Stories Affect Children P Except in unusual instances, it is not likely that children will be made aggressive or overly anxious because they hear of such matters in stories they are told. The main- springs of aggression and insecurity are fundamental, and methods of dealing with them represent varied and life-long prob- lems. To be sure in some instances sensi- tive children who are already anxious may hear a story which aggravates their fears. But even here it is not likely that the fear is created by the story, and in most in- stances an expression of fear or aggressive impulse in the presence of other children, or in the presence of a loving adult offers a means of working toward its solution. Children, like adults, enjoy being a little frightened, especially if matters turn out all right, and if the fright is presented in an art form which could be classified as good literature. Such presentations are sub- tle and somewhat fantastic; they do not dwell excessively on the gruesome and lurid and sensational. Contrast, for example, the horrid and horrible witch in Walt Disney's Snow White with the much vaguer, less frightening original in Grimm. Consider also the sadistic and frightening book Stru- welpeter, such a source of anxiety to many children in the last century. The first poem in the book which tells with excruciating realism in picture and text how the thumb- sucking Peter will have his thumb cut off leaves nothing to the imagination; in its too vivid description it brings a stage- crucial concern too prominently into focus. Mother Goose handles the same concern with far greater finesse in "Along came a blackbird and plucked off her nose." Here the hurt and misfortune fascinate the chil- dren, but do not trouble them with overly concrete, personally threatening details. Humor and Nonsense I have particularly dwelt on the darker emotions, but it would be misleading to suggest that children do not respond to exciting events in ordinary living and to lighter and positive emotions, to humor and nonsense. Perhaps we can call these happy emotions our human heritage, and our ag- gression our human predicament. There are many examples of light and happy stories from children, some perfectly de- lightful nonsense which sometimes made the children laugh so much they could scarcely speak: Titus B. 5:10. "Silliest civil war you ever heard of- worms are fighting us, the al- ligators. You know who always wins- the worms. The giant alligators have fourteen and the worms have 125. The alligators haven't sent up their satellite yet, but the worms have. The worms have sent up 255 satellites. And already fourteen worms are in space- even the babies have little suits the worm size. They have alligator's dead teeth (because they shot a lot of alligators in the war). They don't like to do it because they used to like alligators. But now it's their duty. They are just really strong worms. The snake family is with the worm family- that's why they al- ways win. They are not allowed to go around because there is always a guard that spears them- they have fourteen spears and the worms have none. They have four- teen pieces of metal. Alligators have four-</page><page sequence="5">Values and Issues in Young Children's Literature 291 teen metals too. They both have fourteen space suits. Fish in these days never ate worms but they ate big fish. There were dinosaurs too. Dinosaurs were terrible lizards. They helped the worms and snakes and fish. The meat-eaters eat dead fish- and they were all allergic to plant eaters. All the plant eaters were too old to be eaten- 155 years old. The meat eaters didn't like to eat anything that old. Then the dinosaurs said, "We can beat up the alligators." Then the meat-eaters won. And they didn't like to have those meat-eaters; they speared them." Penny O. 4:10. "A little giraffe lived in a zoo, and he had a little giraffe but the thing was every time he went to sleep a clown woke him up. And then he said, "It's Valentine's Day. You can't go to sleep. You have to work." So he woke up and he got holly, and leaves with berries and then the dog said, "Arf! Arf! Don't believe the clown. Tear up all your work for it's not Valentine's Day. It's Easter!" So then one clown said, "Don't believe your dog for it's not Easter, it's Christmas!" And the dog came, and said, "Don't be- lieve the clown. It's not Christmas, it's summer! Then the clown said, "Don't believe your dog, and it's not summer. It's spring!" And the dog said, "Don't believe the clown. It's winter." And then the elf said, "You darn silly things. What is summer and Christmas, and winter and spring, and fall and Easter?" Tracy H. 5:8. "There was a boy named Johnny Hong Kong and finally he grew up and went to school and after that all he ever did was sit all day and think. He hardly even went to the bathroom. And he thought every day and every thought he thought up his head got bigger and bigger. One day it got so big he had to go live up in the attic with trunks and winter clothes. So his mother bought some gold fish and let them live in his head -he swollowed them- and every time he thought, a fish would eat it up until he was even so he never thought again, and he felt much better." A Sense of Wonder Then there are a number of stories which seem to belong to a group reflecting- in Rachel Carson's words a "sense of wonder." Such stories seem particularly alert to the joy and excitement and mystery of the world, to communion with and appreci- ation of the beauties of nature. Their lan- guage is the idiom of the child, but the themes have overt tones of wonder. One such story comes from a four year old which seems to express the association of feminine sexuality and the sea which appears so often in myths : Lila P. 4:8. "Once there was a fish named Flower. She went down in the water and said, "Oh, my gosh, where's my lover?" She went down in the cellar where my house is. She saw a big father fish which had a sword in his nose. She ran away from the house and hid in another house. She ran up the water and flapped out. She ran away. She went to another house in a deep, deep river. She saw her own home which had her lover in it. They kissed each other. That's the end." Another of the passing of the seasons and birth and reproduction: Harriet S. 5:1. "Once there was a big, big Christmas tree. There was a kitty that owned the Christmas tree. And every year the kitty chipped off a bit of the tree for her Christmas. And when Christmas Eve came, Santa planted another big tree for the little kitty. Then years and years and years more trees came and more Christmases came. But then the years grew shorter and the days longer: the trees began to go away. Every year the kitty chopped down a tree and every year she got a new big tree. And the little kitty had a dog she thought was a kitty. And she didn't know this, 'cause it was in an egg- and she knew kitties didn't come out of eggs. But all of a sudden she went to go away and went and had a squirrel come. And she said, "Will you please, please sit on these eggs. I laid another one just today. But maybe you will lay one for me." Then she took a ride. She was only gone for a day, but then it snowed. And this</page><page sequence="6">292 Elementary English little squirrel got so tired. But then she came back. "Where are my eggs?" "Right here." One popped out, two popped out, three popped out. And then they were all squirrels 'cause the little kitty did not sit on them long enough. She only sat on them half a day. They turned out to be squirrels with wings. She said, "Will you please take these little squirrels away. I do not like them. You always lay them the way you are and not the way I am." But years and years passed and she lay- more and more eggs- they were all kitties -and the kitties all grew up and they all were the beginning again." Here there is influence of Jonah in the whale, with fresh interpretations: Bonnie C. 4:9. "It's about first in the beginning there was a big ship. It was round and then there were five people living in it. And then they went to bed leaving the grease on the stove and the boat burned down. They all fell in the water and they got swallowed by one whale. And then they had a stick before they jumped in the water so they hit the whale's throat with a stick. And then you know what happened? Then they were free and they jumped out of the whale's mouth. Then they ran up on top of the water and they found a new boat and they found a piece of money on the sky and they caught it when it fell down and they paid for the houseboat and they never left the grease on the stove again and the stove on." A three year old manages to get a certain beauty into his description of a nightmar- ish chaos: Upton S. 3:9. "A goat man. The goat man said, "Gone over to the moyie." And then the house came over to the movie, and then crash again! And no one cried again, and the world was all over. Then another world came, and they fighted to another war. Then the war came into the house. And they had a big fight in the house. They knocked down the chairs and tables and candles. And then police came and put them in jail and they had to stay forever and ever. Then the war was all gone and then there was coming for night." Children and Their Thinking There are several other areas I should like briefly to consider without offering further examples from the stories, since those already quoted support what I have to say. I should like to make a few com- ments about sex differences, morality, and children's understanding and use of lan- guage. First, sex differences: even at an early age there seems to be a sex-difference in the type of story children tell. Girls are more likely to talk about people or them- selves; they introduce romantic themes, mentioning love, marriage and children. Boys tend to like themes of action, and talk more about objects than persons. There are studies of reading interests of older children which show a preference along the same lines.5 Whether we go along with such sex-typed interest, or try to widen horizons, it is worth considering a child's sex in connection with providing his books. Next, children's understanding and use of language; since study of children's own stories makes one ponder about what they are understanding from the words they hear. Particularly at younger ages, language is so chaotic, episodes are so unrelated, that there is a real question in my mind as to whether a plot as such registers in se- quence with children under five years of age. I recall that when David Copperfield was read to me, I had no realization it was a single story; it seemed a new tale on each reading occasion. A study I mentioned earlier, carried on at Bank Street College, found it rewarding to question childrens' understandings, and then attempt to clarify them. Even the word deck in Curious % 3 "Children's Reading Interests as Related to Sex and Grade and School," The School Review , 40:252-272, 1932.</page><page sequence="7">Values and Issues in Young Children's Literature 293 George , as well as the word curious had to be explained. The pre-schooler's verbal world is like the infanลฅs total world- "a booming, buzzing confusion"; even the child who handles language well is probably coping with fuzzy understandings. I would not, for this reason advocate simplifying the language in books, nor would I have vocabulary reviews in con- nection with each book, but it does seem wise for adults to realize the limitations of children's verbal understandings, in contrast for instance, to their extraordinary capacity for emotional experiences. Relating unfa- miliar words to familiar ones, providing repeated usages of words, explaining words in numerous ways can help the development of a child's language, and his appreciation of books. Despite their limitations in using lan- guage, there is considerable educational significance in children making up their own stories. They experience pleasure, and grow in self-confidence with an adult's atten- tion to what they have to say, and profit from practice in expressing thoughts and feelings. Stories from pre-school children that are written down and then typed and then read back to them flatter their ego and promote a realization of the origin, usefulness and delight of the written word. Older children can write their own stories and books. Such productions should be appreciated for what they express; it is wrong to discourage such efforts by exces- sive or ill-timed correcting of grammatical, spelling, or other technical inadequacies. Finally, I should like to return to the matter of morality in children's literature: as you recall I have already referred to children's interest in themes about good and evil. Childrens' original stories suggest that ideas of right and wrong may be determined by what they have been told is right or wrong, or by their sensitivity to the parents' approval or disapproval of be- havior. Their ideas represent the "morality of constraint" as Piaget (1932) describes it. That which is wrong seems most of the time to be that which is destructive or aggressive as defined by parents or parent substitutes. There is, or course, a develop- ment in the complexity of childrens' under- standing of wrong-doing. By the age of three there is an awareness in some children that goodness and badness can exist in the same persons or species. Some four year olds cope with the idea that good qualities may exist in seemingly bad characters. The five year old increasingly mentions more subtle forms of ethical misbehavior involv- ing social responsibility: lying, stealing, sending in false fire alarms, letting sick children go to school. Despite this progress- ion, however, ideas of good and bad are not very sophisticated or complicated. It is interesting that young children (and per- haps adults, too) spend more time describ- ing what is bad than setting forth what is good. They often have difficulty, indeed, in defining just what "good" is. In one story, for example, there is an alligator described as good "because his tongue lasts all the way down to his stomach." We already mentioned that books deal- ing with questions of good and bad, either subtly or overtly expressed, are very popu- lar, since this is an early concern, laden with emotion. If we consider the young child's point of view, it is impressive to review all the variables that may go into parental judgment of a bad action. A child who has squeezed toothpaste from a tube may be punished in quite different ways depend- ing upon whether the toothpaste goes into the bowl or on the wall paper, whether the wall paper is plastic or not, whether he squirts out just a little or a lot, and, if the latter, whether it is the last tube of paste in the house! What is good and what is bad? It seems to me that young children need help with clear-cut answers. Certain kinds</page><page sequence="8">294 Elementary English of learning and other problems can come to children who do not develop the ability to analyze good and bad, and to be self- critical about the behaviors which may get them into trouble. Clearly it takes a long time to learn about right and wrong. Books that set forth how such and such consequen- ces come from certain actions are both appealing and educationally significant, since anxieties are aroused when a child gets into emotional predicaments he does not understand. Because children's concepts of morality are so primitive, it seems to me that books with moral messages for young children should not be fuzzy, but should be clearly and explicitly expressed. I am not in favor of the moral message in the book Nubber Bear* for example, which conveys a curious and confusing message of a bear who is naughty, told what he should not do, is spanked, but manages to get what he wants. For the same reason I oppose the "morality" in Where the Wild Things Are,1 where a child is sent to bed without his supper, has a hallucination and then, for no clear reason, finds his hot meal suddenly awaiting him. It seems to me ill-advised to present a child with a prob- lem, and offer no solution except dreaming. Nubber Bear and Where the Wild Things Are are appealing books in many ways, yet, in my opinion, their moral lessons would probably confuse rather than help a young child's emerging sense of right and wrong. Thus there are many insights about chil- dren and their thinking, their problems and their joys that may be learned from the stories they tell and write and the tales they like to read. e Nubber Bear , William Lipkind, ill. by Roger Duvoisin, Harcourt, Brace, I960. 7 Where the Wild Things Are, Maurie Sendak, Harper &amp; Row, 1963.</page></plain_text>
