<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMANTICISM AND THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE R. P. ADAMS Lafayette College M /tORSE PECKHAM, in a recent paper, proposes a definition of romanticism' which I believe may prove highly useful, not only in the study of nineteenth-century English literature, to which he chiefly applies it, but perhaps even more in the investigation of literary history in the United States. It is my present intention to test this proposition by applying Peckham's theory to some works of the period (I850-I855) which F. 0. Matthiessen has called the "American Renaissance." Peckham deals in his article only with the historical meaning of romanticism, not with its general meaning, and he concentrates mainly though not exclusively on its meaning for the study of lit- erature. A definition of romanticism covering this ground should, he says, do two things: first, help us to classify works historically as romantic or other, and second, help us to understand and properly appreciate those classified as romantic. After the usual clearing of the ground, he introduces a theoretical definition which, I agree with him in believing, will do these things-not absolutely, to be sure, but well enough to make the concept extremely valuable for criticism and, especially, for historical research. I wish first to recapitulate, very briefly in my own words, the main points of the definition2 and then to show how I think it may be applied to the works of a few outstanding American writers of the mid-nineteenth century. Historically, Peckham says, romanticism consists in the shift which Arthur 0. Lovejoy describes in the last three chapters of The Great Chain of Being, a shift away from thinking of the uni- verse as a static mechanism, like a clock, to thinking of it as a 1 Morse Peckham, "Toward a Theory of Romanticism," PMLA, LXVI, 5-23 (March, I95I). 2 This article assumes a thorough familiarity on the part of its readers with Peckham's paper; my account of the theory is greatly condensed and therefore inadequate. It is not in any sense intended as a substitute for Peckham's own discussion.</page><page sequence="2">420 e merican Literature dynamic organism, like a growing tree. This shift took place in a few minds at about the end of the eighteenth century, and its impli- cations have been developing in various fields of art, thought, and action ever since. For those who make the shift, the values of static mechanism-reason, order, permanence, and the like-are replaced by their counterparts in an organic universe-instinct or intuition, freedom, and change. Romantic thought is relativistic and plural- istic; it rejects absolute values, formal classifications, and exclusive judgments; it welcomes novelty, originality, and variety. It is less in- terested in distinctions than in relationships, particularly in the organic relationship which it posits between man and nature, or the universe, and (less often) between the individual and society. The great chain of being is replaced by an indefinitely extended and complicated live network of connecting filaments, as in the vascular system of a plant or in a mass of animal nerve tissue, by which every phenomenon is tied by countless direct and indirect contacts to every other. When a new fact appears, it is not just another link in the chain or cog in the machine; it is an evidence of organic growth and development, and its emergence changes every prevr- ously existing aspect of the universe. A new characteristic is evi- dence of a totally new and different world. Therefore a romantic artist will strive, not to imitate an ideal perfection of form which has always existed, but to originate a form which has never existed before and which will uniquely express what he alone feels and knows. To do so, he will rely more on imagination than on logic, more on symbols than on signs or allegories, more on unconscious than on conscious powers. He wvill believe that he is creating a genuinely new thing and thereby changing and renewing the whole of his organic universe. His attitude, given the premise, is perfectly reasonable. One of Peck- ham's most useful contributions, I think, is that he goes farther than anyone else I know to demonstrate that the romantic artist occupies, philosophically, a very respectable position. It seems to me obvious that such a change or shift in thinking took place in America between, say, Edwards and Emerson, or Franklin and Whitman, much as it did in England between Pope and Wordsworth. The conservative effort of Edwards to revive</page><page sequence="3">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 42I Puritanism by reconciling Calvin's theology with Newton's physics and Locke's psychology in a single, permanent metaphysical system is about as characteristic as anything could be of static mechanistic thinking, notwithstanding that it is rather strongly colored by Ed- wards's emotional and sometimes mystical attitude toward God. Franklin, whose deistic beliefs preclude anthropomorphism, is even more easily identified as a static mechanist. His youthful (and, of course, almost entirely derivative) thinking about the freedom of the will brings him to the conclusion that "As Man is a Part of this great Machine, the Universe, his regular Acting is requisite to the regular moving of the whole." Otherwise, he says, it would be "as if an ingenious Artificer, having fram'd a curious Machine or Clock, and put its many intricate Wheels and Powers in such a De- pendance on one another, that the whole might move in the most exact Order and Regularity, had nevertheless plac'd in it several other Wheels endu'd with an independent Self-Motion, but ignorant of the general Interest of the Clock... ."3 The position was a little too rational, perhaps, even for Franklin; certainly most of his con- temporaries preferred not to expose the antihuman implications of mechanism quite so nakedly. But those implications could not ulti- mately be either concealed or accepted. Sooner or later static mechanism had to be abandoned. In America it was abandoned later and by fewer people, prob- ably, than in England or Germany. The organicism which had be- gun to replace it abroad was not effectively adopted here until the I830's, when the short stories of Hawthorne began to appear and Emerson (possibly the first American to go abroad in search of new rather than old ideas) visited Europe and met Landor, Coleridge, Carlyle, and Wordsworth. His publication of Carlyle's Sartor Re- sartus and his own Nature at Boston in I836 makes that year as good a date as any for the beginning of the romantic movement in the United States. In my opinion, however, the greatest works of early American romanticism are not those of Emerson and Hawthorne or of the I830's, but Melville's Moby-Dick (i85I), Thoreau's Walden (I854), and Whitman's "Song of Myself" (i855). It is to these works that I wish to apply Peckham's theory. s Benjamin Franklin, A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain (New York, Facsimile Text Society, I930), pp. II, I2.</page><page sequence="4">422 American Literature II Peckham demonstrates very satisfactorily, it seeems to me, that The Ancient Mariner, The Prelude, and Sartor Resartus are all "about spiritual death and rebirth, or secular conversion."4 That is, they render in various ways the experience that some people have of abandoning one kind of belief in the universe, passing through a period of doubt, despair, and spiritual wandering, and arriving at another kind of belief. Specifically, these works record the break- down of static mechanism, the search for a new metaphysic to re- place it, and the adoption of more or less dynamic interpretations of organicism. I believe that Moby-Dick, Walden, and "Song of My- self" are also about the same experience, and that they make use of the same devices of structure and imagery to communicate their meaning. In Moby-Dick, as in The Ancient Mariner, the chief metaphor of death and rebirth is the ocean voyage, which Ishmael says "is my substitute for pistol and ball." On this voyage Ishmael becomes involved, inadvertently, in Ahab's mad pursuit of the white whale, a symbol of life like the albatross in Coleridge's poem. And, just as the Mariner's crossbow is a mechanical instrument, Ahab is described several times in mechanistic language. Once Ishmael hears him "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him." Speaking of his dominance over the crew, Ahab says, "I thought to find one stub- born, at the least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve." Ahab's ideal man, to be made by a blacksmith Prometheus, is "fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em, to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains... ." What all this means is that Ahab, with his ivory leg and his harpoon baptized with fire in the name of the devil, is in part literally and in the whole figuratively a mechanical man, at deadly enmity with life. 4Peckham, op. cit., p. i6.</page><page sequence="5">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 423 Ishmael, for a time, is carried away by Ahab's intensity and gives himself up with the rest of the crew to revenge and madness. But he has known better things, notably in his relations with the tolerant and tolerable savage Queequeg, and he alone in the world of the ship is able to break away from Ahab's influence. He does so one night when, on duty as helmsman, gazing at the red light of the tryworks, he sees "the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness," as "the material counterpart of her mon- omaniac commander's soul." Lapsing into a hypnotic trance, he loses sight of the compass. "Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Upper- most was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me." He finds that he has turned round facing the stern of the ship. Unconsciously he has dissociated himself from its impious quest and its captain's destructive madness. When the ship is stove and sunk by the hunted whale, Ishmael, clinging to the life- buoy made of Queequeg's coffin, is saved while the rest perish. Out of death he is reborn. There are many subtle and complicated reasons for this rebirth, which can perhaps be most nearly, though inadequately, expressed by reference to the subtle and complicated attitude that Ishmael develops toward life and toward the white whale as a symbol of life. Without ever denying for a moment that the whale is full of power, malice, and evil, Ishmael realizes, as Ahab does not, that it is also full of goodness, beneficence, and beauty. On his first view of Moby-Dick he says that: A gentle joyousness-a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns . . . not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam. . . . for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea- fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.</page><page sequence="6">424 American Literature A few minutes later the whale, swiftly rising again, crushes Ahab's boat in its jaws. The unresolved complexity of Ishmael's attitude here is con- sistent with his views on other matters. He paradoxically exalts the nobility of "the kingly commons" of Nantucket's ocean empire. He respects both the beauty and the fierce, tigerish power of the sea, but he is not afraid to dive "among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world" to discuss its monsters, its sharks, whales, giant squids and krak.ens, finding in it a "visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems ... the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it." Above all, he understands that man's life is an unending movement of change, with nothing fixed or safe, no haven on a lee shore. He sees even, as very few people have the courage to conceive, that "there is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:-through infancy's un- conscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eter- nally." Because he knows life thus in all its complexity of organic, incessantly changing relatedness and because he accepts it and loves it in its evil and terrible as well as in its good and joyful aspects, and also because he sees and loves the nobility mingled with the savagery of a Queequeg, the weakness of a Starbuck, the thoughtlessness of a Stubb or a Flask, or even the crazed evil of an Ahab, he is worthy of his own life and of being reborn, as he is, from the deadly en- countering shock of the most irreconcilable opposites. In Waldlen, as in Moby-Dick, the pattern of symbolic death and rebirth is used to express a revolt against static mechanism in favor of dynamic organicism. Thoreau begins by saying, in effect, that most men, involved in the mechanical activities of commerce, do not live. They are "so occupied with the factitious cares and super- fluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked</page><page sequence="7">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 425 by them." A laboring man "has no time to be anything but a machine" and "men have become the tools of their tools." To this mechanistic image of man as he is Thoreau opposes an organic image of man as he might be and as the romantic believes he should be. "The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above ?" Man, hav-ing died, should be reborn. The purpose of Thoreau's experiment at Walden is accordingly to discover whether, once a man "has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced." Believing that "the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be ex- changed for it, immediately or in the long run," he plans to reduce his material wants, trade as little time as possible for mere subsist- ence, and devote the rest to the organic process of life itself. The basic structure of the book may be most clearly understood in the fact that Thoreau, "for convenience," condenses his two years' experience at Walden into one, and describes it beginning with sum- mer and proceeding through fall and winter to spring. The turn- ing seasons thus define a process of symbolic death and rebirth which, for Thoreau as for other romantics, represents the character of personal development. In the summer chapters, which take up most of the room in the book, he discusses chiefly the relation- ships between man and nature and between the individual and so- ciety, alternating between the two themes in "Reading" and "Sounds," "Solitude" and "Visitors," "The Bean-Field" and "The Village," "The Ponds" and "Baker Farm," and "Higher Laws" and "Brute Neighbors." In the fall chapter, "House-Warming," he re- luctantly goes indoors, to something like hibernation. In the three winter chapters he discusses "Former Inhabitants; and Winter Visi- tors," "Winter Animals," and "The Pond in Winter." He is most interested in this section in history and metaphysics, and in har- monies of relationship which he infers from the regularity of the</page><page sequence="8">426 American Literature pond in this comparatively static season and from the fact that ice from it is to be shipped as far away as India. His climax is the chapter on "Spring," a paean of rebirth in which he carries the organic metaphor to its ultimate conclusion. Seeing how the clay on the bank of a railroad cut flows under the rays of the spring sun he announces roundly that "there is nothing in- organic. . . . The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,-not a fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic." He is impressed particularly by the grass, which he says "flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire ... not yellow but green is the color of its flame;-the symbol of perpetual youth," and it assures him of his own rebirth after death. "So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity." As for the pond, he simply remarks, "Walden was dead and is alive again." Life, as Thoreau understands it, is not only organic but very ex- plicitly dynamic as well. That is why he says that "in any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line." His business, he explains, is "to antici- pate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any neighbor was stirring about his business, have I been about mine!" Morning is Thoreau's most frequent symbol for the moving present moment, which continually supersedes tradition and the past. The most important thing is always life in the present; "alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof." And Thoreau also very well under- stands that this dynamic aspect of life implies diversity; change leads naturally to variety; the new thing is a different thing. There- fore he cautions his reader that "I would not have any one adopt my mode of living on any account; for, beside that before he has</page><page sequence="9">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 427 fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way, and not his father's or his mother's or his neighbor's instead." It should hardly be necessary to point out how closely, in the terms of Peckham's theory of romanticism, Walden is related to Carlyle's Sartor Resartus in theme, structure, and imagery. And, for once, it is probably safe to suppose that the relationship is largely a result of direct influence, for it was at Walden that Thoreau wrote his very perceptive and enthusiastic essay on "Thomas Carlyle and His Works." In that essay Thoreau says that Carlyle's "earlier essays reached us at a time when Coleridge's were the only recent words which had made any notable impression so far . . . and he has no doubt afforded reasonable encouragement and sympathy to many an independent but solitary thinker." One of those who ben- efited most from this transatlantic tutelage was surely Thoreau him- self. He was never merely a follower, however, and he seems to have gone considerably farther than Carlyle in his belief that each indi- vidual life is a process of continual change, continual growth, con- tinual rebirth. Every morning, he says, is an occasion for complete renewal "to a higher life than we fell asleep from. . . . That man who does not believe that each day contains an earlier, more sacred, and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired of life, and is pursuing a descending and darkening way." And morning need not be confined to an hour only. "To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning.... Morning is when I am awake and there is a dawn in me." And he adds, "To be awake is to be alive." He is not content, after his experimental rebirth at Walden, to rest on that achievement. "I left the woods," he explains, "for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one." He left for the same reason he went, that is, to seek rebirth in a new phase of life, growth, and development. Like Melville, he tells us that life does not advance in a single straight line but through a series of morn-</page><page sequence="10">428 American Literature ings, or springs, each novel, unpredictable, and intensely interesting. Whitman's use of symbolic death and rebirth as a structural pattern in "Song of Myself" is less obvious than either Melville's or Thoreau's in the works we have examined, but it is none the less effective. Like Thoreau he finds a prime symbol of regeneration in the grass, which he guesses is "the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven," or "itself a child .... the produced babe of the vegetation," or "the beautiful uncut hair of graves," growing from the bodies of the dead, "from under the faint red roofs of mouths," and he exclaims, "O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues" which "do not come from the roofs of mouths for noth- ing." Death has no terrors for Whitman because he believes that it is a phase of a cycle, that it always leads to rebirth and more life. "The smallest sprout shows there is really no death," he says. "All goes onward and outward .... and nothing collapses, / And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier."5 Through- out the poem grass is consistently presented as an organic metaphor of rebirth, of communication after death, and of immortality in that communication. Whitman makes his meaning clearest when he says near the end, "I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, / If you want me again look for me under your boot- soles." What this tells us, plainly and emphatically, is that Whit- man himself is reborn in his poetry, which is for that reason called Leaves of Grass and which we may quite soberly say has kept him in a very real sense alive to our thought and imagination. Whitman, like Thoreau and Melville, prepares for this rebirth in communication by saying early in the poem that he will withdraw from "houses and rooms" (though he does not reject them) and "go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked," seek- ing, like the others, to establish his relationship with nature before attempting a return to society through the medium of his work. He finds this relationship to be organic, and he is confident, some- times serenely, more often enthusiastically, that it includes all things, himself, the world, God, and other people, "that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own, / And that all the men ever 'All Whitman quotations in this paper are from the poem later called "Song of My- self," Leaves of Grass, I855 edition, as reproduced for the Facsimile Text Society, New York, I939. In all cases the four-point ellipses are not mine but Whitman's.</page><page sequence="11">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 429 born are also my brothers... . and the women my sisters and lovers, / And that a kelson of the creation is love... ." The universe, to Whitman as to other romantics, is alive, and he is passionately in love with it, longing to embrace the "barebosomed night," the "voluptuous coolbreathed earth," the "Capricious and dainty sea." Being alive, it is naturally dynamic; it grows and changes. Whit- man describes its evolution in sexual terms, the changing present being characterized for him, as it hardly is for Thoreau, by "the procreant urge of the world." But he is no more interested than Thoreau in "the beginning or the end," concentrating instead on a dialectic process of change which is the very essence of dynamic organicism. "Out of the dimness opposite equals advance. Always substance and increase, / Always a knit of identity. always distinction.... always a breed of life." Whitman's emphasis on the "distinction" is to many people his most outstanding characteristic; so much so that the structural organization of his poems, especially "Song of Myself," has not been sufficiently noticed. He is of course a fascinated diversitarian, reveling through endless catalogues in the greatest possible variety of relationships and activities, entering at great length, by sym- pathy and by empathy, into the lives and feelings of people in all places and occupations. "I resist anything," he confesses, "better than my own diversity," and he is resolved that every aspect of it shall be represented. He is the poet of evil as well as of good, and a vehicle for "Voices of sexes and lusts. . . . voices veiled, and I remove the veil, / Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigured." Out of this vast variety, and specifically out of the dialectic of good and evil, also comes developing life. "The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me, / The first I graft and increase upon myself. . . the latter I translate into a new tongue." Though he is less easy to analyze or to quote than Thoreau or Melville, partly because of this almost explosive diversitarianism, Whitman is if anything an even more consistent and radical positive romanticist. His determined insistence on variety as well as on change and his lavish use of organic imagery make him an almost perfect exemplar of Peckham's definition.</page><page sequence="12">430 American Literature III That definition, however, is not complete, as Peckham says, without the concept of negative romanticism, which is needed as much in the study of American as of English literature. Positive romanticism will not account for Poe any better than it will for Byron, many of whose attitudes Poe shared and continued, and transmitted to the French romantics who took him for their proph- et. And I think it is important that such writers as Byron, Poe, and Baudelaire be firmly placed in the romantic movement, and that the character of their romanticism be clearly understood. Peck- ham defines negative romanticism as the attitude of those who have rejected the old static mechanistic world order but who have not, for whatever reasons, arrived at a satisfactorily dynamic and organic metaphysic to replace it. They are often haunted by feelings of guilt, alienation, and fear, none of which appear to have any ade- quate cause, until we realize that negative romanticists inhabit a universe without purpose or meaning. They have, therefore, no sufficient sense of place or direction, or feeling of relationship to their environment. Their world is a place of confusion, of un- certainty, and very often, quite understandably, of terror. Most recent critics and historians of literature have found them easiest to understand as weaklings, sick men, and neurotics, which many of them certainly were. But their position is none the less valid or in- teresting for that, and their work, I suspect, is negative and often morbid as much for philosophic as for psychiatric reasons. I find it very hard to believe that neuroticism equals genius, as one extreme kind of psychological interpretation tends to imply, or that a man's work may be good because he is ill. The negative characteristics of Poe's work are obvious enough in his preoccupation with themes of crime, terror, incest, burial alive, and forbidden knowledge, and in his strong affinity to the Gothic tradition and the Byronic pose. At the same time he is obviously romantic in his appreciation and use of Keats and Cole- ridge, in his partial subscription to an organic theory of form in lit- erature, and most of all in his practical use of symbolism to ex- press ideas and feelings of which he is largely unconscious and apparently very much afraid. It might be said most simply, per-</page><page sequence="13">Romanticism and the American Renaissance 431 haps, that his indirect and, as it were, inadvertent self-expression through symbolism constitutes him a romantic and that his fear of self-expression, his insistence on the purely conscious and intentional character of his work, his refusal in "The Philosophy of Composi- tion" to examine the sources of his inspiration, and his very super- ficial notion of originality show that his romanticism is negative. The fundamental contradiction may be seen in much of his critical writing, as when he remarks in "Marginalia" that: To see distinctly the machinery-the wheels and pinions-of any work of Art is, unquestionably, of itself, a pleasure, but one which we are able to enjoy only just in proportion as we do not enjoy the legitimate effect designed by the artist:- and, in fact, it too often happens that to reflect analytically upon Art, is to reflect after the fashion of the mirrors in the temple of Smyrna, which represent the fairest images as deformed. The difficulty seems to be partly that Poe is thinking of a work of art as an organism and trying to analyze it into "wheels and pinions" as if it were a machine. The deformation results not so much from the fact of analysis as from the fact that the analysis is made in the wrong terms. It might indeed be better not to analyze at all, but it would be better still to analyze correctly, that is organic- ally. The same kind of inconsistency may be found in Eureka, where Poe concludes that "all is Life-Life-Life within Life," but where life is described in completely static terms. Poe's "living" universe proceeds from a normal and right state of unity through an abnormal and wrong phase of diversity to its original unity again, the whole process being an absolutely orderly and logical result of a single act of will on the part of God. Poe is pathetically certain that in this formulation he has discovered the ultimate truth, which can never be altered, "since," as he remarks in passing, "Truth and Im- mutability are one." And so, in Poe's metaphysic, are life and death. IV In this country, as in Europe, the ideas of positive romanticism have been cogently developed by only a very few people. The great majority of Americans have remained static mechanists or, at the most, negative romanticists, and they have generally succeeded in making life uncomfortable for those who, in the interests of</page><page sequence="14">432 American Literature organicism, dynamism, and diversitarianism, have refused to con- form to majority mores and opinions. The struggle has been ag- gravated here by the relatively long persistence of Puritan and Fundamentalist theology, by the overwhelming predominance of middle-class commercial interests, and more recently by the tre- mendous growth of technological skill and industrial power. Static mechanism has never been more apparently successful than in the United States over the past century and a half, or enjoyed greater prestige except, perhaps, among the dialectical materialists of the Soviet Union. Therefore, probably, its defects have never been more clearly apparent than to those few Americans who have been courageously independent enough to examine it critically in the light of romantic ideas. This very limited and superficial examination of the American Renaissance with reference to Peckham's theory indicates two rather important conclusions, both of which are in some quarters con- sidered unorthodox. The first is that the independent, self-sustain- ing American literature which arose during the middle years of the nineteenth century was not so much the result of American writers' rejection of European models and devotion to native themes as it was of their somewhat belated rejection of static mechanism and adoption of dynamic organicism, in which they were greatly aided and encouraged by the example of such Europeans as Goethe, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle. The second is that, partly because they had the firm foundation of European romanticism to build on and partly, perhaps, because they were so clearly and completely in opposition to the predominant forces in their own society, these Americans carried the romantic revolution farther and developed its implications more consistently than the writers of any other national literature in their own time or, I am inclined to think, since then.</page></plain_text>
