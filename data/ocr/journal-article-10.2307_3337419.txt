<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Search of Children Dolls and Agency in Africa ELISABETH L. CAMERON "Isn't S/He a Doll? Play and Ritual in African Sculpture" opened at the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History on November 17, 1996. The exhibition, curated by Elisabeth L. Cameron, explores the rich variety of forms and functions that characterize African conceptions of what the Western world calls "dolls." It includes more than 200 figures drawn from the museum's holdings and several private collections. The following essay expands upon ideas presented in the companion publication, written by Cameron with a contribution by Doran H. Ross (UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, Los Angeles, 1996. 124 pp., 17 b/w &amp; 147 color illustrations, bibliography; $45 hardcover, $24 softcover). "Isn't S/He a Doll" closes on November 16 and will travel to additional locations in the United States. african artss spring 1997 18</page><page sequence="2">T he Geek Page, a feature in the computer journal Wired, recently aired a discus- sion of how to teach a machine to translate languages. Computer software engineers have developed several different schemes of varying complexity, but the most promising is to create "interlinguas: sentence representations that are totally language independent...to develop a set of primitive concepts-building blocks of meaning-and to use them to define words" (Jones 1996:84). Basic problems are yet to be overcome, because language, to a certain extent, is culture driven. How, for exam- ple, do you translate the word snow into a language that distinguishes between differ- ent types of snow or that has no word for snow at all? So far, attempts at creating an interlingua have been successful only in technical areas that share basic ideas. The word art presents similar problems. What would the interlingua for art be, and how would it then translate into languages that have no single blanket term for art but rather many that identify different arts? At the core of the problem is the question of whether a universal understanding of art exists. How would we recognize it? Rachel Hoffman suggests that art has its own inner power that reaches out and grabs us, or, in the words of her Dogon informant, "makes us stop breathing" (1995:56-59). But is art defined solely by the power to move the viewer emotionally? This leads to a more trendily framed question: Do art objects have agency? Consider Ivan Karp's def- initions of actor, agent, and agency: The actor refers to a person engaged in action that is framed, as is all social action. An actor's action is rule governed or oriented. The agent refers to per- sons engaged in the exercise of power in its primary sense of the "bringing about of effects," that is, engaged in action that is constitutive. Agency applies the idea of "causal power" through which we realize the potential of the world. (Karp 1986:137) When a specific type of art-in this case the African doll-is considered, this dis- cussion about art and agency becomes meaningful. If there is a universal understand- Opposite page: 1. An Asante shrine displaying successful akua'mma (center), dolls carved to enable a woman to conceive. Near Kumasi, Ghana, 1976. Photo: Herbert M.

In what language do we begin working? Can (or should) we start with English defini- tions to try to identify characteristics shared by dolls from other cultures? In curating the exhibition "Isn't S/He a Doll? Play and Ritual in African Sculpture," I attempted to create an interlingua for dolls by identifying two basic characteristics: dolls are anthropomorphic (in form and reference) and they are involved or manipulated in an action we consider play. Again, problems arise in trying to define play. Do some ritu- al figures qualify as dolls according to this definition? When I think about an interlin- gua for play and ritual, I find that these two categories of action are surprisingly alike: both create extraordinary worlds where objects-such as dolls-can come alive; both can restructure the mundane world for a time. Because of these similarities, I believe certain ritual figures can be considered dolls within the ritual realm. Now armed with a working definition of dolls in both play and ritual, we can turn to the issue of agency. There can be little debate that within the play world or in the imagination of a child, dolls are people and act as agents. An adult onlooker may sim- ply see a child serving tea to or staging a mock battle with a group of dolls, but the child perceives the figures as having their own life and volition. They drink or spill the tea on their own, have personal likes and dislikes about what type of sandwich they want to eat. They disobey commands and control the conversation. When the child leaves the play world, however, the doll becomes an inert physical manifestation of the person who lives in this extra-mundane world. If dolls in the play realm have agency, what about dolls in the ritual realm? Returning to Hoffman's discussion, we note her claims that art objects (which would include dolls) do have a power of their own. Scholars responding to Hoffman's essay, on the other hand, contend that objects only have the power that we, as individuals or a culture, choose to Opposite page, top left: 4.

Sidney Kasfir is skeptical of universal affect, the power the object has to move outsider viewers (1995:15-16). She does, however, acknowledge the effect of an object, its power to cause change within its own culture. Since my emphasis here is on the effective power dolls have on the lives of the people who made and used them, Kasfir seems to be squarely on the side of their agency. John Picton suc- cinctly states the alternative view that an object's power is based within people rather than itself: "The supposed agency of artifacts...turns out to be a rhetorical figure (perhaps a metaphor) within the language we are using....Thus we are the active agents; yet we are so only by virtue of material artifacts into which we imag- ine agency" (1995:85). This debate has been going on for millennia. It is noteworthy, considering academia's Judeo-Christian roots, that both views appear in the Bible. A rather matter-of-fact analysis of an "idol's" lack of power appears in the Old Testament: "They have mouths, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see" (Psalm 115:5-7). On the other hand, one of the Ten Commandments, recog- nizing the power of such images, forbids their creation: "You shall not make for yourself any idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on earth beneath or in the water under the earth...for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God..." (Exodus 20:4-5). Many religions in which this mandate appears, including Chris- tianity and Islam, have broken this rule more often than kept it. After all, God had to send Moses down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments ahead of schedule because the people waiting below had already made a calf of gold to worship. As the Christian church spread throughout the Roman Empire, battles again were fought over the efficacy of images. David Freedberg has written extensively on the medieval use of images and relics to cause change in events and attitudes. The development of humanism during the Renaissance and Reformation, however, gave rise to a more scientific view of the powerless- ness of objects. Over the centuries the pendulum has swung back and forth. At present, as demonstrated by Picton's re- marks, the scientific side is strong in academia. Living in Los Angeles, how- ever, I am struck by the number of peo- ple who invest in crystals or sleep under pyramids, believing these have an in- herent ability to heal, bless, and change their lives. african artss spring 1997 22</page><page sequence="6">If we could document and explain sci- entifically how and why dolls work in rit- ual, perhaps Westerners would more easily accept their agency. Compare, for example, the effectiveness of procedures at the UCLA Fertility Center and the use of a doll in Africa to encourage a woman's conception. Both the priest or healer who prescribes and consecrates the doll, which is used in combination with other treatments, and the doctor who performs in-vitro fertilization have culturally ap- propriate evidence of their successes. The doctor participates in scientific studies, publishes her results, and places a photo- graph album of babies bor as a result of her work in the waiting room for hopeful couples to look through. For much the same reason the Asante priest places suc- cessful dolls on his shrine (Fig. 1). The human factor is never outside the equation in either Africa or the West. Picton claims that people "imagine" agency into lifeless objects, perhaps much as a child "imagines" life into a doll-a powerful imagining indeed! In The Power of Images Freedberg discusses the animat- ing force of consecration, when the "deity is induced to inhabit the piece of inani- mate matter" (1989:84). Without people to create, interact with, or view them, objects have no agency.l People give agency to an object, but once it gains a life of its own, whether in the play, ritual, or mundane world, it also gains volition and is not always controllable by those who conse- crated or used it. Dolls, then, obtain agency on two lev- els. First, people who make and own dolls give them power. As we have seen, many scholars argue against this first level, say- ing that agency always stays with the person who manipulates the object and cannot be transferred to the object itself. The second level comes from the person- ;. hood of the doll itself. Few scholars dis- 11 agree with the idea that people within a society can manipulate power and effect I change. Because of their unique ability to assume personhood in play and ritual, DENIS NERVIG COURTESY OF THE UCLA FOWLER MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTOR' African dolls are agents of change. This is especially true in regard to a woman's fertility. Dolls dealing with fertility are widespread in Africa, where the pressure to become a mother is enormous. A woman is taught from childhood that she must bear children; this idea is reinforced when she matures. A childless woman cannot move to the highest level of knowledge, simply because the holders of most high ritual positions must be mothers. In many places women are controlled with threats against their fertility: if they stray from social norms, it is said that they will not bear children. In women's initiations among the Lunda and Luvale of Zambia, for example, the initiate will be rendered barren if she fails to follow any part of the ritual appropriately. Funerary practices reveal the importance of having children. Children are respon- sible for making sure their parents have a proper burial. R. E.

The Edo believe that one who is not properly 'buried' cannot enter the society of his dead kin and associates" (1965:97-98). Alternate rites exist for the childless. For example, among the Lunda Ndembu of Mwinilunga, Zambia, mourners bur an X into the back of the deceased, who is buried face down, spit upon while in the grave, and cursed. In Kenya the Gusii bury childless women with a thorn piercing each nipple. A bound chicken is set on her grave to "cry" in place of the children she did not have (LeVine 1982:46). While fertility is the blessing of the ancestors, infertility-of the land, animals, and humans-is the work of ancestors, gods, or spirits who are trying to gain people's attention. Among the Baule of C6te d'Ivoire, the most common way for a neglected otherworld mate (female, blolo bla; male, blolo bian) to gain the attention of his or her earthly partner is to prevent her from con- ceiving or to cause him to become impotent. If a diviner traces the problem to the otherworld lover, an image is carved to rep- resent this spirit (Fig. 2), and the person will dedicate one evening a week to attending to-and playing with-the figure (Ravenhill 1994). Dolls ensure the fertility of some women and restore it to others. When a girl is able to bear children, dolls protect and cel- ebrate her fertility. When she marries, they enhance her ability to conceive. For barren women, dolls create the ability to con- ceive. They can even act as surrogates for deceased children, protecting the family from harm and encouraging the mother to conceive again. Each of these possibilities should be looked at more carefully. african arts* spring 1907 29 29 african arts- spring 1997</page><page sequence="13">DENIS NERVIG, COURTESY OF THE UCLA FOWLER MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTORY Left: 17.

Girls in Africa learn at an early age how to hold, feed, and protect an infant. I have seen four- and five-year-olds caring for their siblings, and an eight-year-old put in charge of a newborn while the mother was away in the fields. African dolls work to ingrain and reinforce a girl's desire to become a mother (Figs. 3, 4). Parents watch how their daughter treats her play children as an indicator of her future fer- tility and maternal skill. In Zaire, at the birth of a new baby, a Luba mother gives her older daughter a doll so that she may pretend she is also a mother (Centner 1962:75-80). Among the Nguni-speaking peoples of southern Africa, the communi- ty watches how a girl treats her dolls. If she constantly plays with them, they say she will have many children (Lange 1961:86). If she mistreats her doll or does not protect it, her parents reprimand her for not being a good future wife and mother (Hechter-Schulz 1966:518). In Zaire, Tabwa girls make small dolls out of clay (wato- to wa udongo, or "earthen children"). Significantly, approximately half the "earthen children" in Western collections represent mothers with tiny babies tucked into cloth wrappers (Fig. 5). When a girl reaches maturity, the community celebrates and protects her potential motherhood, teaching her the responsibilities that come with adult status. Her educa- tion often takes the form of an initiation ceremony. In some areas dolls are used dur- ing initiations as symbols of the novice's future children (Fig. 6). The mwana hiti 30 african arts spring 1907 30 african arts- spring 1997</page><page sequence="14">("wood child") or mwana sesile ("gourd child") of the Zaramo of Tanzania must first be empowered through sacrifices and through proximity with the ancestor figures of the initiate's paternal clan (Felix 1990:80-81). Once the girl has been placed in seclusion, her paternal aunt gives her the activated doll. The initiate dresses the mwana hiti with her own hair, cloth, and beads. She treats it as her own child, feeding, bathing, and attending to it. At the end of her seclusion, the initiate dances in public, doll in hand. Members of the community might put coins on the mwana hiti's head as gifts. Once the fes- tivities end, the women deactivate the doll by stripping it of ornamentation, then place the wood or gourd figure back in storage until the next daughter comes of age (Swantz 1965; Harding 1961; Felix 1990). Often a woman moves out of initia- tion directly into a marriage relationship in which dolls also play a role. In Angola, when an Ambo woman marries, her mother gives her the family doll (Figs. 7, 8), which is named by the new husband. The wife cares for it, wearing it in her belt tightly pressed against her stomach to hasten conception. The women in the family pass the doll down through the generations (Hechter-Schulz 1966:518; Estermann 1976, vol. 1: 80-81). Among the Sotho peoples of Lesotho, when a girl begins to look for a marriage partner, her grandmother may give her be ' a small beaded doll to wear around her neck, ensuring that she will be sought after by men (Fig. 9). During wedding ceremonies, the bride carries a larger doll (Fig. 10), also made by her grand- mother, to signify her desire to bear many children. She keeps and cares for it until the birth of her first baby, which DENS NERVIG COURTESY OF THE UCLA FOWLER MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTORY is named after the doll (Lange 1961:93-94). A similar practice is observed by the neighboring Nguni-speaking peoples (Hechter- Schulz 1966:519). A Tsonga woman of southern Africa who has just given birth trans- forms the beaded doll into beaded ornaments to be worn by the child (Becker &amp; Nettleton 1989:11). The neighboring Venda peoples use a girl's doll to seal her marriage. When a girl matures, her grandmother teaches her the "laws of her child [doll]," that is, the laws of married life. The figure accompanies the new wife to her husband's house. Before the marriage can be consummated, the husband must pay the price of a cow for the doll, then take it to the girl's grandmother and learn the laws of the doll. When he is able to repeat these laws to his wife, she accepts his sexual advances (Roumeguere &amp; Roumeguere-Eberhardt 1960). Most African cultures do not consider a marriage to be sealed until the first child is born. Occasionally a doll-child can act as surrogate in the interim. Among the Fali of Cameroon (Fig. 11), for example, when a young man becomes engaged, he carves a doll (ham pilu) out of wood and decorates it with hair, beads, and other small objects. He makes the doll to reflect the desired first child. He then gives it to his 19. Ere ibeji carved by Areogun of Osi (1880-1954). Yoruba peoples, Nigeria.

The best-known of these dolls is the akua'ba (pl. akua'mma) of the Asante peoples of Ghana (Figs. 12, 13). Among the treatments and actions pre- scribed by the priest might be the com- missioning of an akua'ba. The priest consecrates both the figure and the woman, who treats it as if it were her own child until she gives birth. Mothers can give successful akua'mma back to the priest for display on his shrine (Fig. 1). Ross notes that women may keep their akua'mma even if they do not conceive. There have been reports of a woman even being buried with the doll (Ross 1996:44). Other African peoples also use doll children to treat infertility. In Burkina Faso, Mossi dolls (biiga) appear in initia- tion and marriage ceremonies to ensure that the bride will have many children (Fig. 14). If a woman does not become pregnant, she will commission a larger doll and treat it like a living child. A suc- cessful biiga leads the way for the new- born. Just after delivery, before the infant can be cleaned, the doll is bathed, anointed, and handed to the new moth- er, who gives it the first few drops of her milk. Even later, as the mother is caring for her human child, she continues to lavish attention on the doll child.2 The Mossi claim that most women who call upon the kinkirsi, or spirits, through the use of biiga bear twins. If the doll is unsuccessful in producing a child, the woman might give it to a young girl to play with. Many other examples might be cited. In Cameroon a Namchi woman who is having difficulty getting pregnant takes a wooden doll made by a blacksmith and adorns it to look like a female initiate re- turning to the village-the ultimate sym- bol of potential motherhood (Fig. 15). She feeds it gruel and carries it on her back (Fig. 16), as a mother would a child, until she becomes pregnant (Weidholz 1943:41). Historical records also show that many different groups in South Africa, including the Sotho, Zulu, and Xhosa, utilized dolls to enhance fertility (Hechter-Schulz 1966:520). Occasionally dolls move between play and ritual worlds. Turkana dolls, for exam- ple (Figs. 17, 18), can be either played with by children or used by a barren woman to encourage pregnancy (Best 1993:159-64). Sometimes a doll acts as surrogate for a deceased person. The best example of this category is the ere ibeji, or "carved twins," of the Yoruba (Fig. 19, 20). These south- western Nigerian peoples believe twins to have many playful characteristics; they are "feisty, unpredictable, and fearless" (Poynor 1995:6). They walk with the orisha (gods) and are able to bless or curse their families. As a result, parents diligently care for and honor their twins by feeding them special foods, begging and singing in the market- place for them, and performing other rituals designed to make them happy and encourage their blessings. Because twins have consistently low birth weights (caused african arts- spring 1997 32</page><page sequence="16">by a number of factors, like premature birth), often one of them dies. The deceased twin may become jealous and "call" the living twin to join him or her in death. To appease the deceased twin and honor him or her equally with the living twin, a small anthropomorphic figure is carved. It portrays the deceased child as an adult, incorporating appropriate symbols of the status that would have been achieved or received if the twin had lived. (Occasionally a woman will choose another type of image, such as the plastic doll seen in Figures 21 and 22, to be an ere ibeji.) The mother feeds, bathes, and dresses the figure when she feeds, bathes, and dresses the surviving twin. When she goes to the market to beg for her living child, she begs for the deceased one as well. The power of the doll never abates, and a family never abandons it. When the living twin is able, he or she takes over the care of the figure, or the family might entrust it to the care of a "mother of twins." In cases where both twins die, dolls are created and cared for so that the living and future members of the family will not be harmed (Houlberg 1973; Poynor 1995:61-62). I argue that the interlingua for doll should be expanded to include the characteristic of agency as well as anthropomorphic form and involvement in play. Dolls everywhere have causal power, whether for an American child playing house or an African woman with maternal aspirations. African dolls embody and bring into existence children who, in turn, effect changes in women's lives. A mother moves from being a person outside the social structure, her status barely above that of a child, to being an adult fully incorporat- ed into the community. This development highlights one of the interesting aspects of agency: the dynamic created between, on the one hand, a person's freedom of action and, on the other, the social expectations and rules placed on that same individual. The social expectation in Africa is motherhood for all women. Dolls function in childhood, initiation, and marriage to keep most women as actors-those defined by Karp as acting within the rules of society-by ensuring their fertility. If a woman is infertile, dolls and women, working together, use the freedom of agency to move her back into the social pattern. O Notes, page 93 Left: 21.

In Djenne, II Y A Cent Ans (Djenn6 a hun- dred years ago), Bernard Gardi, Pierre Maas, and Geert Mommersteeg present 143 archival photographs of the city. All but the final six were taken by French photographers in the years following the bloody French conquest in 1893. Firing more than 500 shells and almost 40,000 bullets, the invaders killed 510 Djenninkes and wounded some 1,200. These were viciously brutal losses to inflict on a city of this size; when a census was taken less than ten years later, its population was 5,000. The authors are to be commended for pub- lishing these compelling images. Gardi dis- covered the first seventy-two, shot by a French doctor, Albert Rousseau, in the Swiss collection of Ruth and Peter Herzog. The oth- ers were selected from among "thousands and thousands" of French West African colo- nial postcards produced before World War I and catalogued by the French postcard-histo- rian Philippe David. Based on their extensive fieldwork in Djenne and detailed examination of the photos, archi- tect Maas and anthropologist Mommersteeg provide fascinating captions, particularly about local artisanry like weaving, fishing, boat-build- ing, and sun-dried mud-brick masonry. Many captions draw upon Maas and Mommersteeg's Djennd, Chef d'Oeuvre Architectural (1992), which should be read in conjunction with this book, along with a collection of seventeen articles (three by Mommersteeg, Maas, and Gardi) con- stituting Djenne: Une Ville Millenaire au Mali (1994), edited by R. M. A. Bedaux and J. D. van der Waals. Djenne, Il Y A Cent Ans opens with forty- seven pages of text. First comes a short histor- ical essay by Bintou Sanankoua, author of Un Empire Peul au XIXe Siecle (1990). She mentions only one Djenninke by name, Koi Konboro, the legendary thirteenth-century king of Djenne. Converted to Islam, he transformed his adobe palace into the city's gigantic first mosque. Next, Gardi provides a detailed description of the French conquest of Djenne and the West African Sudan, mentioning ten Frenchmen and two Djenninkes by name. As a "context for the photographs," Mommersteeg and Maas contribute an essay called "The City of Djenne Around 1900," and Gardi discusses the sources of the images. Generally the regret- table paucity of named Africans reflects a vir- tually exclusive interest in and dependence on French colonial records. The book's 73-item bibliography adds use- ful reference works to the listings given in Djenne, Chef d'Oeuvre (122 entries) and in Djenne: Une Ville Millenaire (310 entries). None of the three, however, includes either the Arabic manuscript "Ta'rikh Jenne" or the "Monographie du Cercle de Djenne" (1909) by Felvre, Commandant de Cercle de Djenne. Except for Timbuctoo, Djenn6 is the only genuine small city in the Sahel. Through the centuries it has been a unique, ethnically mixed island in an ocean of distinctly separate peoples. How, paradoxically, has the city's heterogeneity forged such a striking independence? Time and again, Djenne, facing foreign conquest, has exhibited the same pattern: fierce resistance, then, despite defeat, the maintenance of vigor- ous pride. In 1473 the city resisted the Songhai Empire, according to tradition, for seven years, seven months, and seven days. In the nine- teenth century Djenne resisted invasion four times, then succumbed each time with heavy losses. The city twice fought Sekou Amadou, founder of the Peul Empire of Macina, then the Toucouleurs (Tukulors), then the French. I see the construction of Djenne's third great mosque as a continuation of this tradition of independence, of tremendous local and civic pride. Oumar Sanfo (1840?-1914) was Djenne's last great Muslim scholar. Sanfo wished to reconstruct the ancient mosque of Koi Konboro, Djenne's first (p. 30; ills. 53, 77, 78,107,125,132), ruined in the 1830s by Sekou Amadou. The only photo of the ruins I know that is not in Djenne, II Y A Cent Ans is described in my Spectacular Vernacular: The Adobe Tradition (1996, p. 177, fn. 19, view 4). Sanfo needed to destroy Amadou's mosque, Djenne's second (built 1834; pp. 31-32; ills. 54, 65, 66, 85-87, 111, 135). A similarly designed though much smaller mosque survives in the Orboye neighborhood of Bankass, in Dogon country. According to Ibrahim Cisse, it was built by Sekou Amadou's son Abdoul Salam (Cisse, my interview, Bankass, 1993). An extraordinarily adroit architectural patron, Sanfo maneuvered the French into raz- ing Amadou's mosque in order to avoid break- ing the law that prohibits Muslims from harming a mosque. He never proclaimed his leading role in constructing the third, present mosque (by architect Ismaila Traore, built 1906-1907; ills. 136-40), but allowed the French notes CAMERON: Notes, from page 33 [This article was accepted for publication in January 1997.] 1. Freedberg adds that objects do not have to be consecrated to display effect in people's lives, but evidence of effective- ness almost always leads to consecration. 2.

Sanfo showed himself impres- sively free of the ego compulsion of so many monument builders-the edifice complex. Djenn, II Y A Cent Ans illustrates one of the most important and beautiful structures in the city, the two-storied "Maison du Cadi," which is popularly, if incorrectly, known as "the oldest house in Djenne" (ills. 75, 129; detailed plans of the house appear in Djenne, Chef d'Oeuvre, p. 181, and Djenne: Une Ville Mill6naire, p. 87). Several features identify a "Toucouleur" facade. Massive columns flank the doorway. Above it an overhanging mantel casts a dark shadow, inviting and mysterious. The house, located in the northeastern Algasbah neighborhood, belongs to the promi- nent Maiga family. Traditionally the chef, or head of the city, lived in it. From 1888 until his death in 1906, the house was occupied by chef Hasseye Amadou Maiga (p. 18; ills. 99, 100). He is the only Djennink6 of the period who is mentioned by name in Djenne, Il Y A Cent Ans except for Alfa Moussa, the Toucouleur chef who fled the French conquest (p. 18). The present chef of Djenne, Ba Hassey Maiga, grandson of Hasseye Amadou, has ex- plained intriguing motifs of the house, seen in one photograph (ill. 75) taken in 1904 (my interview, Djenni, 1984). At that time the house was owned by a son and mother; the chef, their relative, was living there. Because they wanted to remind the city that they, not he, were the owners, they modified the roofline. They re- tained the phallic form of its right pinnacle but pared down the left one. Near it they sculpted a breast-like form. Documenting a World Heritage city of unique loveliness and historical importance, Djenne, II Y A Cent Ans contains archival mate- rial of tremendous value.
