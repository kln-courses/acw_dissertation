Ben Bollig University of Westminster Introduction Throughout his career the Argentine poet and anthropologist Nestor Perlon- gher (1949-1992) sought to create and investigate spaces for desire and com- munities based on desire. In this essay I aim to examine some of the key interlocutors that he chose for this project. Perlongher identified himself in essays and interviews throughout his career as responding to an avant-garde tradition.' I aim then to identify and question this relationship with the avant-garde and its immediate followers in Argentina.2 This involves re- sponding to the following key questions: which writers of the avant-garde does Perlongher identify as present in his work? What does Perlongher take from their work in terms of poetics, aesthetics, or thematics? In what ways does Perlongher's work differ from, diverge, or go beyond that of his stated *Elements of this essay were written while the author was in receipt of an Arts and Humanities Research Board studentship, for which he is most grateful.

What then is the purpose of Perlongher's relationship with and appropriation of the avant-garde, when critics such as Birger and Hobs- bawm have denied the viability of a "Neo-avant-guard" writing? Sex in the City: Oliverio Girondo Perlongher was clear in stressing the importance of Oliverio Girondo (1891- 1967) for his work, dedicating an article to Girondo in the sixth issue of the review XUL, entitled "El sexo de las chicas." The title alludes to two works: firstly, Girondo's poem "Exvoto" (from Veinte poemas para ser leidos en tranvia), which deals with "Las chicas de Flores," a district of Buenos Aires renowned for its prostitutes; and secondly, Perlongher's own essay from 1983, "El sexo de las locas" (Prosa 29-34),3 where he attacked the strange mix of homophobia and homoeroticism found in everyday life in Buenos Aires. Many of Perlongher's poems draw very directly on Girondo's work. His long poem, "Cadiveres," for example, opens as follows: Bajo las matas En los pajonales Sobre los puentes En los canales Hay Cadiveres (Poemas 111) The poem uses a slideshow effect to show the appearance of dead bodies, as Perlongher cuts between different pieces of evidence of violence. This gains a flat, factual tone through the use of nursery rhyme-like five-syllable lines and an abcb assonant/consonant rhyme scheme. The stanza borrows clearly from Girondo's poem "Desmemoria": Primero: ,entre corales? Despubs: debajo tierra? Mias cerca: &amp;por los campos? 3. This essay, published in El porterio in 1984, was originally presented as a paper at a conference held by the Centro de Estudos e Assistencia Sexual, Sdo Paulo, in 1983.</page><page sequence="3">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE -s 159 Ayer: ysobre los airboles? iSon demasiados siglos! No puedo recordarlo. (Persuasi6n 900) Perlongher and Girondo's poems enter into an intriguing dialogue. If Per- longher's poem, written in the early 1980s and published in 1984, represents an attempt to examine the slaughter that took place during the dictatorship years, the intertextual reference to Girondo suggests the key position of ex- perimental poetics in examining memory and inscription. Girondo's poem questions the possibility of the inscription of our perceptions and memory ("iSon demasiados siglos!"), given that the human being and the language he or she uses is flawed, while Perlongher's poem tests that assumption within the urgent socio-political confines of the end of a bloody dictatorship. The slideshow technique, which allows Girondo to move from place to place while maintaining an unfragmented narrative position, becomes a key tool for the opening of Perlongher's attempts to inscribe the crimes of the dicta- torship. Elsewhere, Perlongher draws on the more purely linguistic experiments found in Girondo's work, as in the former's poem "Repfiblica": Oh la Diosa Razn: las muselinas de sus amigas: las cabareteras las cupleteras las partiquinas las trotacalles las meretrices las vitrioleras las cabezas de murga las rumberas (Poemas 53) Perlongher's poem takes two liberal ideals-reason and the republic-and uses them to frame an alternative nation, a community of artists, prostitutes, dancers, and singers. Perlongher creates another almost childish rhythm with five- and six-syllable lines. In addition, he uses compound neologisms such</page><page sequence="4">160 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo5 as "partiquinas." The techniques he uses for creating an alternative commu- nity based on sensuality and art are also found in the juxtapositions and experiments with language of Girondo's collection En la masmidula, for ex- ample in the poem "Cansancio": Y de los replanteos y recontradicciones y reconsentimientos sin o con sentimiento cansado y de los reprop6sitos y de los reademanes y redidlogos id6nticamente bostezables (179) Girondo's technique is to take a common habit in colloquial Argentine Spanish, the addition of "re-" to a part of speech for intensifying purposes, and use it to stretch the possibilities of intelligibility. Whereas Girondo's poem is closer to a linguistic experiment, Perlongher's represents a more political project of creating space and language for marginal groups such as streetwalkers and prostitutes. Another poetic technique shared by Girondo and Perlongher is the frag- mentation of the body as a method of presenting the theme of sex in the urban environment. Such is the case with Perlongher's poem "carnaval-rio 1984," taken from the "Frenesi" series: El enterizo de banlon, si te disimulaba las almorranas, te las cefiia al roce mercuarial del paso de las lianas en el limo azulado, en el ganglio del ainade (no es metaifora). Terciopelo, correhuelas de ter- ciopelo, sogas de nylon, alambrecitos de hambres y sobrosos, sabro- sos hombres broncos hombreando hombrudos en el refocilar, de la pipeta del peristilo, el reroer, el intraurar, el tauril de merurio. (Poemas 105) As well as using the types of neologisms and half-words ("tauril," "merurio," "reroer") we have seen in Girondo's work (above), Perlongher also displays an intriguing attitude toward desire in the urban environment, characterized by the fragmentation not only of those observed-as we would expect in a vanguard poem that attempts to expand the scale of vision, in a fashion similar to the Cubist attempt to depict conceptually a place or object by uniting parts and points separated in space-but also through the fragmenta-</page><page sequence="5">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 161 tion of the observer. The observed bodies are seen in parts and poses: "ente- rizo de banlon" (a nylon one-piece suit), other fabrics such as velvet ("terciopelo"), parts of the body ("hombros," "almorranas," piles), and masses of bodies. At the same time the repetition of the second person object pronoun ("te"), the rapid movement of description-faster and less unified than that found in a collage, a slide show or a cubist image-and the absence of any first-person presence, show the narrative position, the observer, in a similar state of fragmentation. Girondo, a clear presence in this poem, also employs this technique of fragmentation in an attempt to portray desire in the urban environment, but with a key distinction, as we shall see, in the poem "Exvoto": Al atardecer, todas ellas cuelgan sus pechos sin madurar del ramaje de hierro de los balcones, para que sus vestidos se empurpuren al sentirlas desnudas, y de noche, a remolque de sus mamis-empavesadas como fra- gatas-van a pasearse por la plaza, para que los hombres les eyaculen pa- labras al oido, y sus pezones se encienden y se apaguen como lucidrnagas. Las chicas de Flores, viven en la angustia de que las nalgas se les pudren, como manzanas que se han dejado pasar, y el deseo de los hombres las sofoca tanto, que a veces quisieran desembarazarse de 61 como de un cors6, ya que tienen el coraje de cortarse el cuerpo a pedacitos y arrojirselo, a todos que les pasan a la vereda. (Veinte 41-42) The poem reinstates desire where the law and social mores deny it; the girls are too young to desire ("pechos sin madurar") but the social signifier of this youth is itself a site of desire. The city--as social organizer and protag- onist-is not only that which forbids illicit sexual conduct, as in the separa- tion enforced by the "ramaje de hierro" of the balcony, but also a tool of desire, in the sensuous touch afforded the railing by the young girls. The mothers are both protectors and promoters: "para que" uncovers the pur- pose of the evening promenade, while "eyaculen" suggests the sexual climax that the courtship ritual postpones and commodifies. Thus the poem is both an attack on suburban hypocrisy, but also an attempt to create the poem as a space for the city as protagonist and sexuality as theme. In "El sexo de las chicas" Perlongher talks of the "fragmentaci6n de los cuerpos" (26) in poems such as "Exvoto." This is clear not only in the poem's ending-the girls physically cut parts from their bodies-but also in</page><page sequence="6">162 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2005 the portrayal of the body itself as parts, such as "pechos," "oido," and "nal- gas" and its coverings, including "vestidos" and "corse." Furthermore, there are no individual girls, just "las chicas" or "ellas." However, the fragmenta- tion is different from that which takes place in Perlongher's work, as high- lighted by the US critic Jill Kuhnheim in her assessment of Girondo's work. Perlongher's essay overlooks possible critiques of the framing of sexuality in Girondo's poetry by a relatively unchanging and innately male gaze- observing the fragmented "Chicas de flores" for example-whereby sexuality becomes a technique that in fact stabilizes the male narrative position at the expense of the observed female bodies. Perlongher's poem, on the other hand, destabilizes such a gaze in its portrayal of sexuality in the urban envi- ronment. Girondo represents a central interlocutor in Perlongher's dialogue with the avant-garde, and provides key tools, in particular experiments with neol- ogisms, half-words, and the fragmentation of the body. However, it is clear that Perlongher's project goes further in its attack on the narrative position and the often implicitly male gaze that stabilizes Girondo's poetry. In fact, there is another element altogether in Perlongher's use of Girondo's poetry. In the essay quoted above, Perlongher suggests that in poems such as "Ex- voto," "por un lado [ ... ] los cuerpos se despedazan. Por el otro, la sexuali- dad misma aparece despedazada en todos los rincones del cuerpo social" (27). Perlongher's view of sexuality in Girondo as something spread through- out society closely follows Deleuze and Guattari's statements regarding desire in Anti-Oedipus: "Desire is present whenever something flows and runs, car- rying along with it interested subjects-but also drunken and slumbering subjects-towards lethal destinations" (105). As Perlongher's piece continues he begins to echo Deleuze and Guattari almost to the word. He talks of persons in Veinte poemas being "todos los sexos" (27) where the Frenchmen spoke of "n sexes" (Anti-Oedipus 296). Furthermore, he discusses how Gi- rondo's poems privilege "las formas, digamos, menores" (25), a term drawn from Deleuze and Guattari's book on Kafka, Towards a Minor Literature (1975), to describe those forms of writing that destabilize a major language, for example Kafka's use of German with its hyper-politicized content and Prague-Jewish inflection. Thus we can see Perlongher's essay on Girondo not only as popularizing the poet he found as a genealogy for his own work, but also as a means to diffuse, perhaps in a simplistic manner, the theories of those writers he found useful for his own project of examining male prostitu- tion in Sao Paulo.</page><page sequence="7">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 163 Perlongher's final words on Girondo are equally revealing: El "sexualismo" de Girondo parece proceder de una desterritorializaci6n eminentemente paisajistica [ ], pero donde los cortes del deseo estin marcados-los lugares donde el deseo rasga la mascarada social. Esta libidi- nizaci6n se vuelve luego contra el propio yo-la identidad-y disuelve al objeto. (27) Deterritorialization and the attack on the "I" or self are taken by Perlon- gher as the two central traits in Girondo. But they are also two key elements in the version of Deleuze and Guattari's thinking presented by Perlongher in interviews and essays: "[s]i no hay un yo-reza Mil mesetas -, si somos todos multiplicidades" (Prosa 139). Thus we can detect a number of processes at work in Perlongher's appropriation of Girondo's poetics: firstly, Perlongher is using the avant-garde as a predecessor for a poetic project of writing the obscene and indecent within the urban environment; secondly, he is insert- ing Girondo into a Deleuzean framework, including terms such as "minor" and "deterritorialization" drawn from Deleuze and Guattari's work on writ- ers such as Kafka; and, finally, he is using this to popularize Deleuzean ideas related to his own intellectual project of examining desire within the social- specifically at this stage his work on male prostitution-attacking the indi- vidual and social stratification. The Body and Transgression: Enrique Molina In an interview with the review Babel (1988-1992), Perlongher spoke of the importance of Enrique Molina to his writing: "Pero los que me nu- trieron-la poesia es un elixir-fueron los surrealistas (como Enrique Mo- lina) [ ]" (Prosa 14). It is unclear in the interview whether Perlongher is talking about the European surrealists (the group led by Andre Breton that formed in the 1920s and included at different times writers such as Antonin Artaud and Robert Desnos); their Argentine counterpart, a group that emerged fitfully in Argentina with the publication of the journal Que (1928) and again in the 1940s and 1950s with the journals edited by Aldo Pellegrini, such as Ciclo (1948) and A Partir de Cero (1952); or any of a number of other groups. Nevertheless, the naming of Enrique Molina (b. 1910), a recognized writer within the Argentine surrealists, allows us to attempt a concrete analy-</page><page sequence="8">164 HISPANIC REVIEW Spring2oo5 sis of the elements Perlongher draws from the work of a surrealist, as in the poem "Para Camila O'Gorman": Con su sencillo traje de muselina blanca tijereteada por las balas, rea La caperuza que se desliza sobre el hombro desnudo (bajo el pelo empapado de cerezas) Como un anillo de lombriz de tierra que huye Asi ella se levanta El ruedo del sencillo vaporoso de muselina blanca, sin breteles Los jirones del fux de vaporosa, sencilla (pero blanca) Como nieve de rata de la noche detris de los altares Asi huidiza (Poemas 77) Perlongher's poem seems to draw on a surrealist technique found in Moli- na's novel Una sombra donde suefia Camila O'Gorman (1973, republished 1984) whereby an empty dress appears in a disquieting fashion as a premoni- tion of death. However, the situation is rather more complicated than that. Perlongher's poem describes the body of a person who has been shot, and uses three poetic techniques to do so. Firstly, metonymy sees the effects of the killing through the effects on the trappings of the body-the pierced "muselina," muslin, of a dress, the "caperuza," or hood, which slips down. Secondly, synecdoche takes parts of the body for the whole-the vulnerable naked shoulder-to fragment the person. Finally, rather obscure similes re- inforce the effect of these techniques; the hood is like the ring of an earth- worm ("lombriz"), and the twill ("sencilla") is like snow, itself a cliche, but snow "de rata," of a rat. This multifaceted and fragmented body seems to draw heavily on the techniques of surrealism, an effect reinforced by the apparently nonsensical final simile ("como nieve de rata"). Where Perlongher's poem differs from the surrealists' work, however, is in its easily recreated sense within a certain communal environment, specifically that of those familiar with the story of Camila O'Gorman and Buenos Aires slang, or lunfardo. The phrase "asi huidiza" highlights two elements of that which has gone before it. Firstly, the body is fleeting, like snow, as it has been the victim of execution. Secondly, the body is one that flees; this reminds us that in lunfardo a rata is a person who runs away. This possible meaning is reinforced by the title; Camila O'Gorman was a historical figure who became</page><page sequence="9">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 165 increasingly well known in the 1980s owing to Maria Luisa Bemberg's film Camila (1984). She was executed in 1845, while pregnant, at the hands of the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, for having an affair with a priest and running away to the provinces, where she and the priest founded a primary school. The subject was also dealt with in Molina's novel, which I would call quasi-surrealist, as while it includes anthropomorphic and fantastic ele- ments-Camila and her lover gain animal body parts during sexual inter- course, for example (Obra completa 183)-it is historically researched and contains a clearly defined plot. Thus, unlike the surrealist juxtaposition, whereby two elements not normally found together in the world are placed together for shocking and psychically revealing effect, Perlongher's strange juxtapositions instead function as a reference for a certain community of readers familiar with his codes and practices. What then is the importance of the intertextual relationship to Molina the surrealist in Perlongher's writing? I would suggest that Molina's novel represents an opportunity for Perlongher to find validation for three the- matic elements within his writing: the body, desire, and rebellion. In Camila O'Gorman, Molina focuses closely on the body of Camila, particularly during sexual scenes: "Por las piernas de Camila corria un licor filtrado gota a gota a travis de todas las estrellas de la vida animal, con el olor de caverna marina y algas de propio sexo, olores genitales como la transfiguraci6n del horizonte y el calor y la luna" (Obra completa 183). Furthermore, Molina praises the anus, and with it sodomy: "el impulso er6tico transforma en exaltaci6n, en magia, la parte del cuerpo humano donde se cumple la funci6n mis humi- Ilante" (203). Molina, like Perlongher, takes what is conventionally consid- ered gross or obscene, or at best only regarded in medical terms, such as genital effusions, and through juxtaposition with positively valorized terms ("licor," for sweetness and intoxicating qualities, "estrellas" or "luna," for their esoteric and ascendant qualities, or "magia" and "exaltaci6n"), cele- brates the obscene, within a specifically Argentine context and with reference to Argentine history. Furthermore, like Perlongher, Molina privileges desire, and reveals how hypocrisy and violence in the (Argentine) social aim to pre- vent its flows and connections. As he states in the novel, "los esplendores del erotismo nacen a la sombra de los tabfies mas severos" (227). Molina's novel portrays Rosas as having a homoerotic love of whipping backsides and wear- ing makeup, priests who wear woman's underwear and let rats crawl around in their trousers, and the secret incestuous desires that live at the heart and in the organization of the bourgeois family. In terms of transgression and</page><page sequence="10">166 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo5 rebellion, Camila, like Perlongher's travestis (in the poems "Ethel" [Poemas 84] and "Natalie" [46]) and chongos (in the poem "El polvo" [31]), has a sexual relationship (with a priest and outside of marriage) that is not only forbidden, but also incurs the wrath of a violent dictatorship. Moreover, like Perlongher's roaming miches and border-crossing homosexuals, Camila is a runaway, fleeing her family and the patriarchal order. As Perlongher quotes at the beginning of his poem "Herida pierna," "Deseoso es aquel que huye de su madre" (Poemas 47), a quote from Jose Lezama Lima (in Jimenez 473) that underlines Perlongher's focus on desire and flight. In terms of broad themes then, Perlongher finds in Molina a vital prede- cessor. However, as we have seen, at a poetic level, Perlongher does not seem overly keen on adopting surrealist techniques, such as free association or automatic writing, instead preferring writing that is more orderly and deci- pherable. A brief examination of Molina's poetics will perhaps allow us to suggest reasons for this discordance between Perlongher and one of Argenti- na's principal surrealists: Eternas criaturas de la tierra, seguiremos andando debajo de las flores, con ligeras estrias azules en el hombro. Y acaso reconozcan nuestros nietos por su pelo arbolado, y su manera de decir: "Otofio." ("Tambi6n nosotros," Obra poetica 12) Molina's poem is strongly lyrical: the first person plural, maintained throughout, implies the conjoined couple of the love affair. Although strange juxtapositions occur, such as "pelo arbolado," a metaphor for thick hair that approaches what one might find in a surrealist exquisite corpse, the poem largely respects syntax and favors the unification of people as an expression of love. It is not as strange or disquieting as many French surrealist works; in fact only one or two surprising elements-"otoflo" and the striped shoul- ders-suggest surrealist practices at work in the piece, which largely func- tions as a lyrical love poem. In other collections, however, we see this type of love poem as a conserva- tive form, where binaries such as man-culture/woman-nature are reinforced: Si apoyara en la noche mi cabeza como sobre algfin pecho de mujer, cuando ya todo</page><page sequence="11">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 167 ha cerrado sus ojos, cuando ya todo ha cruzado las manos - el odio y el deseo- te veria llegar con tus linternas, vengador vagabundo cubierto de flores, Paranfd, rio mio ("Aguila de las lluvias," Obra poetica 88) The poem links the experience of viewing nature-the Parana-with that of sleeping on a woman's chest. "Cabeza" is placed in a dual relationship, to "noche" through metonymy and "pecho de mujer" through simile, a posi- tion that allows access to a form of beyond, specifically the river Parani, but also, by implication, dream. A relationship nature-woman is created through analogy between two states of repose, both assumed to be natural. Woman and night become natural means to ascend to a beyond, and with it some sort of truth or greater communion. Thus man is left in the culture position, also exalted symbolically in his status as the viewer and recorder of two natu- ral landscapes-the woman's body and the river. Problematically, however, the river ("Parana, rio mio") is masculine in gender, and so the comparison between the landscape of the woman and that of the river also creates a triangular relationship between the man, the woman's body, and the river as a macho crony. Thus the poem serves the feminist hypothesis suggested by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in Between Men (1985), that a triangular relationship often exists in literary portrayals of heterosexuality, whereby the man's rela- tionship to woman is always in fact one of two men relating to an object- woman, whereby the woman serves as a disguise for "homosocial" desire found in jealousy, macho friendliness, or competition.4 Discussing Molina in the context of Argentine surrealism, the Argentine critic Graciela de Sola comments, "Enrique Molina [ ... ] confia a imigenes de gran belleza su exaltaci6n de la libertad y del amor" (177). Her assessment draws out the key characteristic of love in Molina's work, a love that Sola, and I believe Molina, are careful to classify: 4. Kosofsky Sedgwick's central example is Manet's painting Dejeuner sur l'herbe (1863), where the nude woman between the two men represents both the gift and the subject of conversation. It is the woman who looks straight at the painter, but the men who make the decisions. Jose Amicola illustrates Sedgwick's argument with a cordobes joke: a man is on a desert island with Claudia Schiffer. Fearing they might be the last two people alive, the two have sex to continue the species. After the act, the man asks Claudia Schiffer to pretend to be another man. It's one thing making love to the most beautiful woman in the world, but the real pleasure, Amicola concludes, is having another man to brag to (19n).</page><page sequence="12">168 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2005 Todos ellos [Argentine surrealist poets], en fin, ven la realidad como dina'- mica fusi6n de los opuestos, en marcha hacia su total unificaci6n; al hom- bre como ser que tiende incesantemente a reintegrarse en el todo, y que se encamina a esa reintegraci6n por acto de amor como enlace heterosexual (toda otra forma de exaltaci6n del sexo viola la naturaleza profunda del hombre, destinado a fundirse en su antag6nico) [ ] (172) The lyrical love poems to be found in Molina's collection Amantes antipo- das (1961), described by Sola as an "ejemplo de la nunca lograda fusi6n de los que se buscan desesperadamente y sin fin [ ] contrarios que se buscan con pasi6n y cuya fuerza da existencia al mundo" (148), or the tragic passion of Molina's Camila, are all distinctly heterosexual. Indeed, Molina's portrayal of sexual hypocrisy, particularly amongst the clergy-the priest who wears lingerie and enjoys letting a rat down the back of his trousers (Obra completa 201-o2)-and of the dictator Rosas (he of the painted lips [64]) is rather homophobic. Molina reveals homosexual desire in order to denounce hypoc- risy, but does so in a manner that unlike the practice of "outing" is never favorable to those acts. Molina's work frequently functions through binaries: he opposes Camila and "las virtudes de la pasi6n, las virtudes de la locura, el honor del amor," to "una sociedad donde imperan a la vez el odio y las virtudes dom6sticas" (19). Later we see violence opposed to love (25) and the opposition between "vida o muerte [ ] verdad del alma o mentiras de la convivencia social" (30). It is these binaries and barriers-between the sexes, between countries, and between time frames-that Perlongher's work often traverses and expands. Thus while Molina and Perlongher coincide in the matter of free love, Molina's love is in fact rather more conservative than one might at first expect. Molina's work has many similarities with Perlongher's-the focus on sex and, later in his career, political provocation. However, Molina's oeuvre of- fers an approach to love and sexuality that is more conservative and hetero- sexual than Perlongher's hypersexual poetics. While Molina's work clearly exhibits the surrealist aim of reclaiming a space for love and transgression, an aim to a degree shared with Perlongher's work, closer examination reveals the practical differences between their literary production, fundamentally centered on Molina's insistence on heterosexuality as the true medium of love, in contrast to Perlongher's insistence on the untrammeled connections of desire.</page><page sequence="13">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 169 Poetic Innovation and Political Engagement: Juan Gelman While Juan Gelman (b. 1930) may not seem as obvious a poetic interlocutor for Perlongher as Molina or Girondo, the later poet was keen to identify the Peronist writer as an important link between the avant-garde and the "New Verse" of which he formed part. Gelman and his "social poetry" are often seen in opposition to Perlongher's work, yet a comparison of key works can reveal important connections and divergences, in particular in their relation- ships to the avant-garde. In an essay written for the Brazilian review Leia Livros, Perlongher at- tempted to characterize the " 'Nuevo verso' " [sic] from the River Plate re- gion that was exemplified by the work of writers such as Le6nidas (b. 1927), and Osvaldo Lamborghini (1940-1985), and Arturo Carrera (b.1948). These writers not only contributed to the same journals as Perlongher (Sitio [Bue- nos Aires, 1981-1987], and Xul [Buenos Aires, 1980-1996], in particular), but are also of a younger generation than Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), Mace- donio Fernandez (1874-1952), Ernesto Saibato (b. 1911), and other respected figures in Argentine letters at the beginning of the 1980s. Thus it is fair to include Perlongher's own work as part of the subject being assessed. Perlon- gher identifies Gelman as an important forefather for these new poets: Gelman encarnou um lirismo social que esmagou as letras platinas, ajudando a converter o idioma em um "parque nacional." O exilio, a frag- mentagdo, a dispersdo acentuariam a tendencia a disparidade e permitiriam o surgimento de um "Nuevo verso." (6) Perlongher's positioning of Gelman as a predecessor to the "nuevo verso" is perhaps ambiguous. While Gelman's work may have helped the new verse to emerge, Perlongher also suggests that his chosen poetics and thematics, with its tendency towards social themes ("social lyricism"), overwhelmed ("esmagou") the River Plate, an apparently unfavorable choice of verb. How- ever, the nationalization of language carried out in the work of writers such as Gelman, a certain democratization of poetry that Perlongher suggests with his phrase "national park," alongside the political circumstances of exile and political dispersal-for example the destruction carried out between 1976 and 1979 by the military dictatorship of the left-wing opposition in Argentina-is key for the development and emergence of the new poetry. Perlongher pre-</page><page sequence="14">170 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo005 sents Gelman's poetry as a key step in the development of the "new verse," in particular in relation to its inheritance from the avant-garde via social poetry. Perlongher's poem that perhaps most draws on the work of Gelman is his polemic and visceral piece, "El hule": Punto en el mar: destello en cromo (noctiluca) Punto en el mar: o noctiluca o destello de cromo de oleaje, denso, de los muelles (Una nifia de Quilmes perdi6 su monedero en unos rieles ... ) Ahora desean que el olvido baje sus cortinillas de hule (efecto humo) en el pantano, humor amor, y las tres moscas (a fuer de fieras, atrapadas) dulces corroan en la mesa, recta, de sus restos: yacencia suspendida, parentear, al parentesis, la biela, yela la grela el tul, quieren que baje, yo, olvidar, el fragmento de prosa, parrafado sudor en el sudario, rastro de inclita musarafia incli naci6n (Poemas 153) A number of features stand out in this poem which illustrate the presence of avant-garde poetics in Perlongher's work. Firstly, the poem's layout breaks up the traditional divide between verse and prose and between different verses and stanzas. The poem experiments with drawing shapes on the page, with the tidal flow of the opening lines depicting the sea scene they suggest. Secondly, the poem experiments with different typefaces, including the italics</page><page sequence="15">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 171 interspersed throughout the text. Furthermore, Perlongher does not follow a recognizable scheme of rhyme or rhythm, instead mixing a long phrases such as "Ahora [ ... ] pantano," which has more than twenty-five syllables, with short, stabbing phrases of as few as three, for example "la biela" or even the monosyllable "yo." Thus the poem draws on the historical vanguards' at- tempts to renovate poetic form away from strict traditional norms. Alongside the formal elements of Perlongher's poem, it is also interesting at the level of thematics and aesthetics. This is one of Perlongher's most menacing and disconcerting pieces, for a number of reasons. The very sparse, almost cinematic opening picks out, physically on the page, and conceptu- ally, an unidentified point ("punto") against an apparently black background of the sea ("mar") seen from the shore-the "muelles" are the wharfs char- acteristic of Buenos Aires's shoreline. The reader is left with various options for the origin of this point of light: a firefly ("noctiluca"), chrome ("cromo"), or the sea, as the "destello de cromo" is metaphorically linked to the sea ("de oleaje denso"). This mysterious opening is juxtaposed with a childish rhyme ("Una nihia de Quilmes"), which, alongside the murky open- ing, smacks of child abduction. The bulky second section then proposes a plural third-person agent ("de- sean") that attempts in some way to hide certain facts. To do this, Perlongher creates a network of phrases related to partitioning, obscuring, hiding, and disguising: "cortinillas de hule," the rubber curtains that separate operating theatres or slaughterhouse floors from the outsider's gaze; "(efecto humo)," a smoke screen, or "parentear," to put in brackets, like "parentesis." In addi- tion we also read "parrafado," paragraphed, which owing to the layout of the poem allows Perlongher to refer to his own piece, itself divided into paragraphs that each represent, in the poem's words, a "fragmento de prosa." This process of hiding is a process of forgetting, and one that is aimed at a "yo," the momentary first-person singular voice of the poem. What is hidden is, as in the opening, only hinted at, but appears to be bestial and violent ("a fuer de fieras"), yet ordered and organized ("en la mesa, recta"). Furthermore, Perlongher sets this within an Argentine idiomatic framework, through the use of lunfardo terms, such as "grela," used in the 1960s for "woman," but more generally "dirt," and "yela," a lunfardo mis- transcription of "hiela," and the kind of terms, for example "tul," that we see in earlier poems, such as "El polvo" (Poemas 31), being used to present the gender-questioning activities of transvestites in Buenos Aires. Further- more, Perlongher includes a suggestion of a link at the level of the nation-</page><page sequence="16">172 HISPANIC REVIEW Spring2005 state-rather than local or micro-communitarian links-between the silenc- ing of the poem and the proscription of memory, in the breaking up of the word "inclinaci6n." This formal device accentuates the presence of "inclita," (renowned), previously innocently paired with "musarafia" (a shrew), but now allowing the naci6n to become renowned. Within Perlongher's poem, there is very little doubt left for the reader as to the fact that this renowned (infamous?) nation is Argentina. The words "musarafia" and "rastro" both have further implications. "Musarafia" is also a speck in one's eye, an awk- ward, persistent presence, or a piece of evidence (from the Latin videre, to see) that physically cannot be avoided, while "rastro" is a trace, another small and potentially awkward presence like the sparkles and chrome of the poem's opening. Through its presentation of an attempt to create active forgetting, particu- larly of what appears to be a bloody medical or surgical operation, Perlon- gher alludes forcibly to the contemporary debate surrounding the post- transition government's attitude to the crimes committed by the military dictatorship in the late 1970s and early 198os. Whereas in Brazil and Chile the military engineered immunity for themselves as part of the process of handing power back to civilians-General Augusto Pinochet's status as a senator ex oficio, for example-the suddenness of the collapse of the military junta after the Falklands/Malvinas war in 1982 meant that there was no op- portunity for the generals to engineer similar assurances for themselves be- fore the elections in 1983. The government of Alfonsin had responded to calls from human rights groups such as the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo and their campaign for information on the whereabouts of disappeared persons and prosecution of military crimes such as torture, murder, and kidnapping, by commissioning an investigation into the military's actions, CONADEP, or the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, whose report, Nunca mds, was compiled by the writer Ernesto Sibato. However, despite initial trials and prosecutions, by 1987 the Alfonsin Radical Party govern- ment, suffering an economic crisis and witnessing the resurgence of Peron- ism as an electoral force, and with hard-line members of the military threatening revolt, proposed what was called the "Law of Due Obedience," radically extending the conditions under which a soldier "following orders" could avoid being punished for crimes. Furthermore, in 1989, in an effort to place a statute of limitations on prosecutions, Alfonsin's government de- clared what was called the punto final law, a forty-day limit, after which prosecutions could not be continued. Both laws, products of political expedi-</page><page sequence="17">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 173 ency that betrayed the spirit of attempts to investigate fully the actions of the military, attempted to draw an ahistorical line under the events of 1976-1983, and to create, as Perlongher's poem suggests, a parenthesis around the re- membering and telling of history. We can conclude then that Perlongher's poem represents an attempt at both innovative formal presentation, and political engagement with a wider historical and social context. Such an attempt finds its most obvious Argen- tine predecessor in Gelman, a poet who took the techniques of the avant- gardes and used them for political effect. This is clearly illustrated by a poem such as "Somas," from the anthology Hechos y relaciones (1980), a collection of poems first published in the 196os and 1970s. Here Gelman conceives of the poet as a witness to the experiences of the people, and a central point in the organization of social struggles: the times literary supplement dice: "golpear genitales con todo el puflo implicaria ruptura violencia y enorme dafio para los 6rganos envueltos" yy aplicar la picana electrica en los genitales? yy quemar golpear el cuerpo tendido y volver a aplicar la picana elkctrica en los genitales? yy volver a quemar golpear el cuerpo tendido y volver a aplicar la picana el6ctrica en los genitales? [... ](21) Gelman's poetry draws on the vanguard experiment with language-the largely limited punctuation, (only one colon, abundant question marks, and no commas), the enumerations of thematically connected infinitives ("quemar golpear"), the repetition of elements in different combinations ("aplicar" / "volver a aplicar")-but with thematics that stress the poet as a witness to torture. Key here is Gelman's lexicon. Terms such as "times liter- ary supplement" are imported from English and are not traditionally poetic language. Nor is the TLS the type of source one would expect for this type of information. The use of such a term includes the everyday experience of dictatorship with the difficulties imposed on the availability of information, and thus the need to resort to foreign sources. Furthermore, a term such as "picana electrica," similarly prosaic, also allows a reality from the dictator- ship, the techniques of torture, to appear in the poetic medium. "Genitales" likewise takes the military's frequent use of medical terminology--the "social</page><page sequence="18">174 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo005 cancer" of subversion, the need to carry out a "surgical operation" on soci- ety, as recorded by, among many others, historians Torre and Riz (330)-and exploits it to bear witness to torture. Technically, through the collage effect of using a quotation from a newspaper, and the use of prosaically measured and extended lines, the poem creates a texture of the quotidian and familiar. However, through the repetition of "y" and words such as "golpear," "picana electrica," "cuerpo tendido" and "aplicar," the poem attempts to mirror the repetitive performance of torture. The lyric and the epic combine in Gelman's work: the personal, isolated experience of torture, and the com- munity created by a shared or possible experience of torture through involvement in the struggle against the dictatorship. The division the poem creates is: us-reasonable-witness-tortured / they-violent-perpetrator- torturer. "We" are by implication centered on the tortured body: we are tortured, or can be tortured. Gelman's text thereby posits a "nosotros," a people, a space of communion in the text between author, narrative voice, and readers, whereby a common relation to military violence-a threat and something to be denounced-unites the persons involved. Thus the poetics of the vanguard offer a tool for expanding the poetic project to include vio- lent repression at the hands of the military. Gelman's writing can be classed as poesia social, one of the schools of poetry that preceded Perlongher and his contemporaries, which was particu- larly dominant in the 196os in Argentina. Poesia social combines the experi- mental poetics and social engagement of the avant-garde with a firm thematic political commitment. Benedetti describes poesia social in the intro- duction to his collection of interviews, Los poetas comunicantes, as: "Com- promiso; voluntad de comunicaci6n; sacrificio parcial y provisorio de lo estrictamente estetico en beneficio de una comunicaci6n de emergencia" (17). Thus social poetry involves a certain effort on the part of the poet: abandoning oneself as poet, committing oneself, taking sides, giving up strictly aesthetic concerns, denouncing injustice to one's fellow men, and proposing solutions. In the two poems from Gelman and Perlongher we can see this effort: a commitment against a central government action, such as torture; siding with the tortured; including prosaic, non-poetic details in the poem; and suggesting an alternative, namely solidarity against torture, and refusing to forget or to remain silent. In an interview, Juan Gelman comments that the constant in his poetry is "la cotidianidad, entendida esencialmente como realidad" (Benedetti 188). Gelman is keen to point out that artistic concerns are not foremost in his</page><page sequence="19">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 175 mind: "mucho mis dramatica que la situacin del poeta que no puede ser entendido me parece la del obrero, que antes tiene problemas mas urgentes" (189). The role of the poet is then to communicate everyday reality, a role that becomes even more vital during times of emergency-during a strike, or after a coup, for example. Kuhnheim suggests that poesia social represents a rupture in Argentine avant-garde poetry, whereby despite the initial ex- change and accommodation that occurred between the politically-minded Boedo group and the more abstract Florida group in the 1920s and 1930s, after the political upheavals of the 1930os and 1940s, such as the military coup led by General Uriburu in 1930, and in particular after the struggles between pro- and anti-Peronist groups in the 1950os and 196os, the gap between politi- cally-engaged or pragmatic poetry-Gelman, for example-and more artistic or metaphysical poetry-Alejandra Pizarnik, or Jorge Luis Borges-became insurmountable. Thus we can see the importance of Gelman for Perlongher's more political writing, as it offers a model of using avant-garde poetics as a means to expand the scope of the poem, in terms of subjects dealt with, its political engagement, and the relationship with an implied and politically sympathetic readership. However, there are key and revealing differences to be found between Per- longher's and Gelman's work, as revealed in the former's poem "El cadaver": Por que no entr6 por el pasillo? Que tenia que hacer en esa noche a las 20.25, hora en que ella entr6, por Casanova Y si ella se empezara a desvanecer, digamos a deshacerse que dire del pasillo, entonces? Por que no? entre cervatillos de ojos pringosos, y anhelantes Yyo por temor a un olvido intranscendente, a un hurto debo negarme a seguir su cureia por las plazas?</page><page sequence="20">176 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo5 Ese deseo de no morir? es cierto? en lugar de quedarse ahi en ese pasillo entre sus fauces amarillas y halitosas (Poemas 42-45, italics in original) Perlongher's poem presents two situations, juxtaposed without warning. The first is that of a voice outside a corridor ("pasillo"), surrounded by threaten- ing yet desiring figures ("cervatillos," little deer, with "fauces amarillas," yel- low teeth and "halitosas," bad breath). The second is the death of Evita Per6n, including the time she died ("20.25," when radio broadcasts stopped during the remaining years of the Peronist administration), and her funeral cortege ("curefia" is a gun carriage, as used to carry important coffins). The poem, through a juxtaposition that draws heavily on avant-garde poetics also used by Gelman, creates a sense of equivalence between the immediate access to pleasure through dangerous means, and Evita Peronism. Perlongher ex- plained this equivalence in an interview with Guillermo Saavedra: "Yo siem- pre habia pensado que el peronismo era un pasillo, un atajo, una manera rapida de Ilegar pero con consecuencias horrorosas" (2). Perlongher's poem likewise uses avant-garde poetics to suggest that the risky shortcut to pleasure found in going into the lower-class and aggressive dwelling in "El cadaver," which in the interview with Saavedra he also links to a real house in a villa miseria on the outskirts on Buenos Aires (2), is the same risky shortcut found in Peronism. This is linked to Perlongher's own difficult relationship with the Peronist movement, in particular the Frente de Liberaci6n Homosexual's (FLH) attendance at the Ezeize rally to welcome back Per6n. Large sectors of the Argentine left, and many liberals, had seen Per6n's return as a shortcut to social justice and democracy that bypassed class struggle, as recounted by Rapisardi and Modarelli, and Torre and Riz. However, the massacre that ensued at Ezeize as left- and right-wing Peronist groups clashed, and the ensuing shift to the right of Per6n and his inner circle, proved such hopes to be unfounded. Gelman's work, however, clearly expresses a faithful Peronist perspective, as in the poem "Escrituras":</page><page sequence="21">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 177 la casa del administrador de la mina de wolfram la boca de la mina de wolfram el arroyo para lavar el wolfram y algunos ranchos eso es todo esa es La Carolina San Luis es chico y La Carolina estzi en San Luis La Carolina es chica treinta mineros sacan el wolfram con sus limparas de carburo escriben mensajes en las paredes de cada socav6n encima de la tierra ,se puede leer lo que hay escrito debajo de la tierra? ,se puede leer los mensajes de La Carolina? "cuidado no sacar mais mineral hasta que apuntalen" dice uno "jose hay que seguir mafiana por este socav6n" pero arriba ,se puede leer? yhay quien lee los mensajes que escriben los mineros abajo? ise pueden leer los mensajes? "Per6n es nuestra finica esperanza" dice uno (Hechos 17) Much of the poem functions as a slide show, cutting from one image of the town and its mine to another, between one line and the next. This technique draws on the influence that film and photography had on the historical avant-gardes, and allows Gelman to present the mine in flat and factual terms. Thus the poem achieves the effect of documentary presentation. Within this presentation, Gelman experiments with the difficulties of writing for and about a perceived people. A movement down into a mineshaft-a concentration on one point and a movement into the deep-and across the walls of caves-not only physically out, but also into the environment of work-questions the communicative ability of the lyric (the vertical axis) and epic (the horizontal axis). The poem suggests that certain forms of writ- ing are preferred to others. The poem itself is read, while the miners' writ- ings, underground, are not, except in the context of this poem. Gelman's poem then suggests the role of the poet as the conveyor of the everyday reality of the worker, given that this reality is excluded from the lives of most people-by distance ("encima de la tierra") or literacy ("Cse puede leer?").</page><page sequence="22">178 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2005 The poet thus unites the two axes, the lyric and the epic. However, problem- atically, the poem builds up to one graffito that is less prosaic than the others: "'Per6n es nuestra minica esperanza.'" Thus, the miners' writings and the poet's presentation of the writings of the miners are firmly inscribed within Peronism, in particular a personalist, populist and unionist Peronism from the 196os and 1970s. Hence the poet's work is firmly circumscribed within the project of organizing Peronist resistance to the various post- and anti- Per6n governments, such as the Revoluci6n Libertadora (1955-1957) or the Revoluci6n Argentina (1966-1973). The possibilities of communication or intellectual leadership that Gel- man's work suggests had largely been closed off by the time of Perlongher's writing. Furthermore, Perlongher's work comes after the massacre at Ezeize, the rejection of the FLH by the Peronist Youth in the 1970s and the purge of left-wing Peronists between 1973 and 1976. Perlongher's poetry emerges from an era when the problem of organizing resistance had been supplanted by the problem of the overwhelming nature of certain discourses: the proceso dictatorship's discourse of the medical cleansing of society and the discourse of the transition to democracy, that full access to global market capitalism would allow everyone to live in peace. Thus the politics that Perlongher chooses to present, using the avant-garde elements drawn from Gelman, is a politics on the margins, in keeping with his focus on desire rather than party politics. Post-poesia social: Perlongher's Project It is apparent from an examination of Perlongher's early work (the collec- tions Austria-Hungria, Alambres, Parque Lezama, and Hule) that there is a clear presence of vanguard poetics. The German theorist Peter Btirger is quite pessimistic about the possibilities for such Neo-avant-garde art. Btirger (80- 83) suggests that the aim of the European avant-gardes was to reintegrate art into the praxis of life, to remove the distance that exists in bourgeois society between the two. In relation to this, the historical avant-gardes demonstrate a clear political commitment in life and art: Breton and many surrealists were members of the French communist party;5 Dada's founder, Tristan 5. In the Second Surrealist Manifesto Breton stated his revolutionary commitment: "I really fail to see-some narrow-minded revolutionaries notwithstanding-why we should refrain from sup- porting the Revolution, provided we view the problems of love, dreams, madness, art, and religion from the same angle as they do" (140). He confirmed his "allegiance to the principle of historical</page><page sequence="23">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 179 Tzara, was an anarchist.6 Titles of surrealist journals--Revolution surrealiste, Le Surrialisme au service de la revolution-leave little doubt about political commitment. At an artistic level, works like Tzara's cut-up poems not only criticize the role of the artist in bourgeois society, but also capitalist values where the art object becomes a fetish and the signature is more important than the quality of the work itself. Moreover, the movements are heuristically linked to contempt for the social organization that had led to the First World War. In the Manifesto of Surrealism (1924), Breton makes the social role of the movement clear: Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought. It tends to ruin once and for all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving the principal prob- lems of life. (26) Once the avant-gardes have staged this type of attempt at renovation, reveal- ing the distance between art and life and art's paradoxical dependence on that distance for its liberty, there is little left that the Neo-avant-gardes can offer, as Biirger suggests: All art that is more recent than the historical avant-garde movements must come to terms with this fact [being distanced from social praxis] in bour- geois society. It can either resign itself to its autonomous status or "orga- nize happenings" to break through that status. But without surrendering materialism" (142). Despite his problems in gaining acceptance from the French Communist Party, he committed the surrealists to the revolution: "we shall prove ourselves fully capable of doing our duty as revolutionaries" (142). 6. Commenting on the genesis of the Cabaret Voltaire, Tzara observed: "we proclaimed our disgust [ ... ]. This war [WWI] was not our war [ ... .. Dada was born from an urgent moral need, from an implacable desire to attain a moral absolute, from the deep feeling that man, at the centre of all creations of the spirit, must affirm his supremacy over notions emptied of all human substance, over dead objects and ill-gotten gains [ ... ]. Honour, Country, Morality, Family, Art, Religion, Liberty, Fraternity, I don't know what, all these notions had once answered to human needs, now nothing remained of them but a skeleton of conventions, they had been divested of their initial content" (from "Introduction," Poems sn). In 1929 Tzara, like Vallejo, visited Russia. In 1935 he joined the French Communist Party. He was involved in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Republicans, and worked as secretary of the Madrid Committee for the Defence of Culture in 1937.</page><page sequence="24">180 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2oo5 its claim to truth, art cannot simply deny the autonomous status and pre- tend that it has a direct effect. (57) The Neo-avant-gardes are easily subsumed into the market, with newness becoming another brand or selling point. "The Neo-avant-garde, which stages for a second time the avant-gardist break with tradition, becomes a manifestation that is void of any sense and that permits the positing of any meaning whatsoever" (61). What then could be the purpose or value of Per- longher's re-use of avant-garde techniques? Firstly, it is important to stress the different context and genesis of Latin American vanguard art to its European contemporary. In Latin America the previous major artistic movement, Modernismo, emerged from struggles for independence, in the case of Cuba, and over the direction that new nations would take, in the case of Argentina after the fall of the dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1852. One of the central figures of the first modernista generation was Jose Marti (1853-1895), the Cuban nationalist who combined Parnassian aesthetics and poetics with patriotic themes, as in the poem "Dos patrias" (1891). If Marti is often contrasted to Ruben Dario (1867-1916) in terms of the Cuban's political commitment and the Nicaraguan's more aesthetic con- cerns, two aspects of Dario's work are obscured. Firstly the Parnassian splen- dor in Prosas profanas (1896) attacked the utilitarian domination of the word by science and what Dario perceived as mediocre values coming to dominate society. Secondly, by the beginning of the twentieth century, Dario was writ- ing poems such as "A Roosevelt" (from Cantos de vida y esperanza, 1905), a polemical address calling for Latin American solidarity-a directly political poem. In contrast to the situation in Europe, the Latin American vanguards did not represent an upsurge in literary-political activities. In Argentina, the first clear vanguard manifestation occurred with the publication of Prisma, (1921- 1922) a newspaper initially stuck to trees and walls in Buenos Aires by Jorge Luis Borges and some friends. Prisma was the organ of young writers wanting to break with tradition and norms in literature, influenced by new European techniques in literature. They formed the group known as Ultraismo (1919- 1923). The aims of the group are summarized in Borges's manifesto of 1921: reduction of poetry to the metaphor; elimination of surplus adjectives, and connectives; abolition of all ornament, including preaching (and thus politi- cal messages); and the synthesis of two or more images into one to broaden the power of suggestion of language (Verani 122; Salvador 36), as displayed</page><page sequence="25">Bollig NESTOR PERLONGHER AND THE AVANT-GARDE 181 in Borges's poetry of the early 1920S. As Verani describes, members of the group went on to publish the review Martin Fierro (1919-1927), central to artistic developments in Argentina and concentrating on "irreverence, ag- gressiveness, playfulness and caustic irony" (122).7 Thus the central avant- garde group in Argentina did not attempt any of the political or social engagement exhibited by its European counterpart. Conversely, the more politically minded Boedo group (1920-1940)8 did not attempt a renovation of either the status or forms of art, but instead focused on content and poli- tics. In Argentina the -ismos did not have the same mix of literary innovation and political reengagement as their European counterparts. In the Latin American context, it was in the post-vanguard era or artists distanced from the organized avant-garde groups where more concrete at- tempts at the reengagement in life through politicization of poetry took place.9 The poetry of Cesar Vallejo demonstrates an attempt in the Peruvian context to renovate art and engage it in social praxis. In Argentina, poets such as Gonzailez Tufi6n and Gelman attempted to combine poetic innova- tion with political purpose for their work. Thus it is important in our assess- ment of the influence of the avant-garde in the work of Perlongher that we acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between avant-garde writing and political engagement in the Argentine context. In some ways the situa- tion works as the reverse of Btirger's assessment of the European vanguards, and clear engagement with the praxis of life comes only after the literary and linguistic experiment of the avant-garde. It was left for poesia social in Argentina, influenced by Cesar Vallejo and others, as exhibited by Gelman, to engage in literary experiment and politics, often reconsidering the role of the poet in relation to society. In Perlongher's early work then we can con- clude that there is a strong influence from these Neo-avant-garde techniques. 7. Other magazines in the Argentine vanguard included Proa, concentrating on literary renova- tion (three editions between 1922 and 1923) and Inicial, running to eleven editions (1923-1927). 8. Roberto Mariani, involved in Boedo publications such as Claridad and Extrema Izquierda, produced the following taxonomy of the Florida/Boedo divide: Florida/Boedo; vanguardismol izquierdismo; ultraismolrealismo; Martin Fierro, ProalExtrema Izquierda, Los Pensadores, Claridad; la gregueria/el cuento y la novela; la metafora/el asunto y la composici6n (Salvador 68). While the members of the Boedo group were interested in reengaging literature and politics, they did not demonstrate a distinct approach to the techniques of writing. 9. An exception is the Amauta group surrounding Mariitegui in Peru, committed from an ideo- logical basis of socialism. Mariategui saw art as very much a social activity, writing that "[n]o aesthetics can reduce artistic creation to a question of technique [ ... ]. And formal conquests are not enough to satisfy an artistic revolution" (from "Arte, revoluci6n y decadencia" [Verani 129]).</page><page sequence="26">182 HISPANIC REVIEW spring2005 Given the distinct development of the literary avant-gardes in Argentina, the adoption of avant-garde techniques in Perlongher's work does not represent the same redundant and tardy gesture that Btirger's writing might suggest. Thus Perlongher's writing draws attention to certain problems in exporting or importing Btirger's models beyond the context of the European avant- gardes. It is intriguing that Perlongher in his writings never attempted to define the avant-garde, or poesia social, and instead reserved his analysis for the "Nuevo verso" or, later, the "neobarroco/neobarroso" to which he felt he belonged. However, Perlongher did name certain figures from the vanguards, as revealed in the pieces analyzed above. What this reveals, I feel, alongside Perlongher's at times scattergun approach to the techniques of his avant- garde predecessors, is the importance that using recognizable names held for his attempts to familiarize readers with certain common reference points for his writings, and for providing a genealogy for his writing. Hence Gelman, Molina, and Girondo offer Argentine names as a synecdoche for a range of poetic practices-expanding the poetic lexicon, using everyday language, writing about sex or perversion, mixing avant-garde techniques with politi- cal denunciation-that create shared reference points between Perlongher and a community of readers also familiar with such writers, or who become familiar with certain techniques and thematics through Perlongher's name- checking. Above all, this approach allows Perlongher to create and explore spaces for desire and the consequences of its connections and flows. While the literary project is important for his work, it is ultimately a tool for his political and sexual aims. Works Cited Amicola, Jose. Camp y posvanguardia. Manifestaciones de un siglo fenecido.
