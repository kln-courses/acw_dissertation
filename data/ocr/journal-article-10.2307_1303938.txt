KEITH RIGBY Department of Geology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602 ABsTRACT-Continued collection of trilobites and the associated fauna out of the Elrathia kingii beds of the Middle Cambrian Wheeler Shale, in the Wheeler Amphitheater of the House Range in western Millard County, Utah, has yielded a varied fauna of sponges. Included and described from the collection are Choia carteri Walcott, 1920; Choia utahensis Walcott, 1920; Diagoniella cyathiformis (Dawson &amp; Hinde, 1890) and Chancelloria eros Walcott, 1920. In addition to those forms, the new species, Diagoniella robisoni, Chancelloria pentacta and a large-spiculed Chancelloria sp., are de- scribed and figured. Diagoniella cyathiformis is reported from the Wheeler Shale for the first time. Protospongia fenestrata Hicks, listed by Walcott from the Wheeler Shale, could be a fragment of Diagoniella for orientation of the fragment is impossible to determine. Kiwetinokia utahensis Walcott, 1920 occurs as disassociated spicules in the basal part of the formation, well below the Elrathia kingii beds which include the most fossiliferous and productive part of the formation. Chancelloria pentacta is distinguished by a preponderance of spicules with five tangential rays, in addition to the buttonlike, proximal-distal rays. Diagoniella robisoni is a small thin-walled, keg-shaped to goblet-shaped, stalked sponge. It lacks pronounced marginalia and prostalia, other than the basal stalk. These species, plus Sentinelia draco Walcott, 1920 and Hintzespongia bilamina Rigby &amp; Gutschick, 1976 comprise the known sponge fauna of the Wheeler Shale. INTRODUCTION CAMBRIAN sponges have been known from western North America for a considerable time (Walcott, 1886) but it wasn't until Wal- cott's (1920) classic paper that sponges were described from Cambrian rocks of the House Range in western Utah (Text-fig. 1). In his paper Walcott described the then known fossil sponges from the Burgess Shale fauna of Brit- ish Columbia and areas to the south. He de- scribed specimens of five species from the Cambrian of the House Range, including Sen- tinelia draco Walcott (1920, p. 290-291), Choia utahensis Walcott (1920, p. 295), Pro- tospongia fenestrata Salter (Walcott, 1920, p. 307), Kiwetinokia utahensis Walcott (1920, p. 312-314) and Kiwetinokia spiralis Walcott (1920, p. 314-315). Of these, Sentinelia draco Walcott and Protospongiafenestrata Salter are reported from the Wheeler Shale. The other species are described from specimens collected from the Marjum Limestone, either in the Wheeler Amphitheater or in Marjum Pass, along the range 16-19 km (10-12 mi) to the southeast. Since Walcott's classic study, Robison (1964a) has reported Choia utahensis Walcott, Chancelloria sp., and hexactinellid spicules from the Wheeler and Marjum formations in Copyright ? 1978, The Society of Economic 1 Paleontologists and Mineralogists 1 the House Range, along with an extensive fau- na of trilobites, brachiopods and minor mol- lusks. A spectacular specimen of Protospongia hicksi Hinde was described and illustrated by Rigby (1966) from Cambrian beds to the south of Wheeler Amphitheater and the new sponge Ratcliffispongia perforata was described from the Marjum Limestone in Marjum Pass by Rigby (1969). The new genus Hintzespongia was described by Rigby &amp; Gutschick (1976) from the Wheeler Shale, a short distance south of Wheeler Ampitheater in the House Range. As a consequence the known sponge fauna of Middle Cambrian beds in the House Range is next to the Burgess Shale in diversity, al- though that diversity has been developed from localities scattered over a relatively wide area in the range. Stratigraphy.-The Wheeler Shale was named by Walcott (1908a, p. 10) for the "al- ternating bands of thin shaley limestone and calcareous shale" exposed near the center of Wheeler Amphitheater in the House Range. The Wheeler Amphitheater and the valleys that lead into it from the west and from the southeast are carved on the relatively easily eroded shale, bounded above by the Marjum Limestone (Text-fig. 2) and below by the Swa- sey Limestone.

Nearly all the sponges described in the paper came from dark calcareous shales in the middle part of the formation, but Kiwetinokia utahensis Walcott occurs in the basal part of the for- mation, southwest of the Harris quarry, in the western part of the Amphitheater (small arrow). Walcott (1908b, p. 18) published a more ac- curate description and a faunal list from the formation. Deiss (1938), Wheeler (1948), Wheeler &amp; Steele (1951) and Robison (1960) have all discussed and described the forma- tions of the House Range. Regional relation- ships and the biostratigraphic zonation of the Wheeler Shale were presented by Robison (1964a, 1964b). Robison (1964b, p. 999) showed the relationship of the outer detrital belt to the middle carbonate belt of Middle Cambrian rocks in Utah and Nevada. Robison (1976, text-fig. 2) showed all but the lowermost Wheeler Shale to be in the lowermost part of the Bolaspidella Zone with the lower approx- imately 27 m (90 ft) in the uppermost Oryc- tocephalus Assemblage Zone, both of Middle Cambrian age.

E42, fig. 21.8. Description.-Small, solitary, low conical, oval to elliptical flattened sponges surrounded by a corona of relatively large diameter, long spicules. Central body of the sponge is com- posed of a radiating thatch of long slender spicules. The central thatch is a dense mass of fine radiating spicules on the upper side but on the lower side has slightly coarser spicules. In two of the three specimens at hand the fine spicules of the thatch are bundled into obvious clusters approximately 1 mm across at the out- er edge of the inner body. In several the bun- dles appear to be grouped around the large radiating spicules that extend far beyond the central disc. The bundled nature produces a serrate, almost fringed margin, to the flat cen- tral disc. The central sponge bodies range from a small form 9 by 12 mm in diameter, to a large specimen, 12 by 16.5 mm in diameter. The initial disc was probably not spherical but was saucer shaped to somewhat conical and is now flattened. The fine thatch of delicate spicules, interpreted to be the upper side, has a low conical form with a low peak near the center of radiation of the spicule. The opposite, or concave side, is more nearly flat and composed of slightly coarser spicules. Individual spicules appear to be diactines with maximum diameter of 0.20 mm, but most show diameters of 0.01-0.06 mm where their cross sections show well in the thatch. They are of unknown length because of the confused EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1 Diagoniella and Choia from the Wheeler Shale, Wheeler Amphitheater FIG. 1-Choia carteri Walcott, 1920 (KU 107224) showing the dense central thatched disc and size of the radiating prostalia.

The bundles or tufts of spicules may be formed of up to 100 spicules in any one cross section and they show an irregular sort of ragged termination at the edge of the central disc. Individual spicules do not appear to be fused laterally to one another, but to be somewhat interwoven to make the composite thatch. The outer, large-diameter spicules extend beyond the central disc of the sponge as much as 12 mm and have maximum diameters of 0.16-0.20 mm. Maximum diameter of these long spicules is at the edge of the fringe of the central disc, from which they taper smoothly and terminate at sharply pointed tips, in the few spicules where the tips are preserved. Some of these spicules appear to be collapsed, for they show one longitudinal striation which is suggestive of collapse of a moderately thin- walled spicule. In one specimen one of the large radiating spicules extends 19 mm beyond the central thatched body to a broken edge. Judging from the taper the spicule may have been as much as 25 to 30 mm long prior to breaking. Discussion.-The specimens agree moder- ately well with the description of Choia carteri (Walcott, 1920, p. 292-294). The size of the central disc and the general proportions of the large spicules that radiate beyond the central disc appear to be of the same general dimen- sions as given by Walcott for that species. Walcott mentioned that Choia carteri is known in his collection only from the Burgess Shale locality in the Mount Steven Formation. Material.--Three specimens are in the col- lection, Kansas University 107224, 107225 and 107300. Two are preserved as limonite- stained clay impressions and one as a relative- ly poor iron-stained clay impression. All are from the Elrathia kingii beds of the Wheeler Shale, in Wheeler Amphitheater in the north- ern part of the House Range. CHOIA UTAHENSIS Walcott, 1920 P1. 2, fig. 2 Choia utahensis WALCOTT, 1920, p. 295, P1. 75, fig. 1; ROBISON, 1964a, p. 563, P1. 92, fig. 22. Description.-The sponge consists of a cen- tral disc of irregularly thatched and complexly interleaved fine spicules surrounded by a co- rona of moderately large radiating diactine spicules. The central thatched disc is flattened in all the sponges available and shows a rela- tively coarse-spiculed lower part and a rela- tively fine-spiculed upper part in the several specimens that are best preserved. The central disc is oval to somewhat elliptical with diam- eters ranging from approximately 25 to 30 mm. Individual fine spicules in the complex thatch are 0.01-0.02 mm in diameter and most appear to be 1-2 mm long, although the tips of the spicules are obscured so that total lengths are not apparent. Most spicules in the central thatched disc lie roughly subparallel to one another, with some interweaving in both a vertical and lateral sense. There is no major spicule arrangement at high angles to the prin- cipal radiating pattern.

KEITH RIGBY Coarse spicules radiate out from the center of the thatched disc and extend as a corona far beyond the main disc. These spicules range from 0.20 to 0.30 mm in diameter and are dou- bly tapering diactines. With few exceptions distal tips of the spicules are broken and prox- imal tips are buried within the thatch. Most fragments are less than 20 mm long but a few well preserved spicules are a maximum of 32- 33 mm long, extending as much as 25 mm out from the margin of the central disc. Many of the large radiating spicules have collapsed and now have median linear depres- sions along the axis or, in some instances, along the flank of the spicule. This suggests that large radiating spicules were relatively hollow, with large crepidal canals, as com- pared with most other siliceous sponges. Col- lapse of the spicule could also have been sec- ondary, after an initial pyritized rind was formed and as the enclosing sediments com- pacted. In some areas the thatch appears to be in bundles associated with some of the large-di- ametered spicules, with clusters of fine spic- ules surrounding cores or axes of bundles made by coarse spicules. Coarse spicules ra- diate from a variety of levels within the thatch. Some are overlain and some underlain by a varying thickness of fine spicules. The arrangement of the spicules in the living sponge is somewhat conjectural because all available specimens are flattened. The central disc appears to have been broadly conical, with the apex of the cone near the center, with the concave side finely thatched and the convex side showing most of the coarse radiating spicules. Two specimens in the collection appear to have been crushed sideways, suggesting that this species, at least, was never spherical but was discoidal or low conical. The lateral col- lapse of these specimens has resulted in clus- tering of the coarse radiating spicules outside the central disc into two narrow angular re- gions. Discussion.-Choia utahensis Walcott (1920, p. 295) differs from Choia carteri Wal- cott (1920, p. 292-294) and Choia ridleyi Wal- cott (1920, p. 294) in the relatively coarse na- ture of the sponge, in the large size of the central disc, and in the larger dimensions of the radiating coronal spicules around the pe- riphery. In general makeup, however, the sev- eral species are similar, with the sponge com- posed of a finely spiculed central disc surrounded by a corona of radiating larger spicules. Several specimens appear to have been flattened sideways. This disrupted the normal radiating pattern and indicates that Choia was not a spherical sponge that has been flattened but was initially a relatively thin discoidal form. In most aspects the spec- imens at hand agree closely with the type spec- imens of the species. Materials.-Nine specimens, in varying de- grees of completeness, are in the collections. The most instructive are KU 107227, 107228, 107229 (the figured specimen) and 107231. Less complete specimens, but still interpreted to belong to the same species, are KU 107226, 107230, 107317, 107318 and 107319. All are from the Elrathia kingii beds in Wheeler Am- phitheater, in the northern House Range of western Millard County, Utah. Class HEXACTINELLIDA Schmidt, 1870 Order LYSSAKIDA Zittel, 1877 Superfamily PROTOSPONGIOIDEA Hinde, 1887 (nomen translatum Finks, 1960) Family PROTOSPONGIIDAE Hinde, 1887 Genus DIAGONIELLA Rauff, 1894 Diagnosis.-Subcylindrical, conical, to sack- shaped or globular, thin-walled sponges whose skeletal net consists of uniformly spaced, di- agonally oriented, rectangularly or rhombical- ly arranged stauract or stauract-based spic- ules. Intervening skeletal areas are covered with diagonally arranged small stauractines and diactines(?). Discussion.-Diagoniella was first estab- lished by Rauff (1894, p. 248) as a subgenus of Protospongia. Rauff listed Protospongia(?) (Diagoniella) coronata Dawson first, followed by Protospongia(?) (Diagoniella) cyathiformis Dawson. Rauff proposed Diagoniella as a sub- genus and separated these two species from others included in Protospongia because of the diagonal orientation of the stauract spicules and quadrangles in the former species. Daw- son &amp; Hinde (1889), in originally describing the Little Metis, Quebec sponges, considered the diagonal arrangement of the spicules to be of less than generic significance. Walcott (1920, p. 309-310), however, agreed with Rauff and raised the subgenus to generic rank and placed those species with diagonally ar- ranged spicules in the genus Diagoniella and 1332</page><page sequence="9">CAMBRIAN SPONGES designated Diagoniella coronata Dawson as the type species (Walcott, 1920, p. 310). Dia- goniella has a basal attachment judging from the restoration of Diagoniella coronata as fig- ured by Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, fig. 8, p. 41) and Rauff (1894, pl. 1, figs. 21, 22). The genus Phormosella was proposed by Hinde (1887, p. 125) for some globular, small thin-walled sponges from the Silurian of En- gland. The skeletal net is composed of mod- erately large stauractine spicules, so arranged as to outline a vertically oriented quadrate mesh, and numerous, small, similarly oriented dermallike stauractine spicules instead of the diagonally arranged, ranked quadrangular net of Diagoniella. The quadrangular openings in Phormosella are filled with the smaller spicules judging from specimens illustrated by Hinde (1887, pl. 3, figs. 2, 2a, b). Hinde (1887, p. 125) noted that in Phormosella the larger spic- ules occur singly and are not bundled but that their rays overlap and do form vertical and transverse lines. Hinde (1887, p. 125) noted in his description of Phormosella ovata that the smaller spicules of the skeleton are not regu- larly arranged and also noted a possibility of a fifth ray on some of the spicules. By "not regularly arranged" I presume he meant not regularly spaced because his illustrations (1887, pl. 3, figs. 2a, b) distinctly show rays of the small spicules parallel to those of the large stauractines. Plectoderma Hinde (1884, p. 132) is a rela- tively thin-walled form that has stauract spic- ules that occur locally in bundles. The spicule rays are so arranged and grouped together that the overlapping rays appear to bundle in con- tinuous, relatively thick, vertical tracts but horizontal rays appear to extend irregularly and singly from the vertical tracts. This skel- eton pattern is distinctly different from that seen in the species of Diagoniella from Utah. In addition Hinde noted that five-rayed spic- ules occur with the cruciform spicules in a large part of the skeletal net. Smaller spicules are arranged in the inner spaces between the rectangular tracts but they are not arranged in any definite order. The total shape of the sponge is not known because Plectoderma was described from a fragment. Cyathophycus was described by Walcott from the Ordovician of New York State (1879; 1883; Dawson &amp; Hinde, 1889, p. 45-46). Cy- athophycus is an elongate conical to subcylin- drical sponge whose thin wall is composed of vertical and horizontal spicule tracts with large stauractines or pentactines placed where the horizontal and vertical bundles of spicules cross each other. Cyathophycus differs from Diagoniella in having a bundled net and in having horizontally and vertically arranged major skeletal elements. Both genera appear alike in having numerous small spicules filling the quadrangular areas between the bundled tracts. Dawson (in Dawson &amp; Hinde, 1889, p. 46) noted that some of the large spicules in Cyathophycus have indications of a fifth distal ray on some of the principal spicules in the wall. Type species.-Diagoniella coronata (Daw- son). DIAGONIELLA ROBISONI n. sp. P1. 1, figs. 4-7 Diagnosis. -Subcylindrical to sack-shaped and globular, thin-walled sponge, whose skel- etal net consists of diagonally oriented, rectan- gularly arranged, stauract spicules enclosing rhombic openings that are subdivided by sec- ond order and, possibly, third order staurac- tines, with numerous small stauractines and diactines(?) as intervening, possibly dermal spicules. The rectangles are outlined by rays of two diagonally placed stauractines, which are arranged in roughly vertical series. Inter- vening skeletal areas are filled with diagonally arranged, but irregularly spaced, small staur- actines and diactines(?), generally occurring in an unbundled arrangement. Oscular rim lack- ing large marginalia but perhaps armored with numerous very small spicules. Primary rectan- gles are 1.5-1.8 mm across at midheight on an average specimen. Sponge with a rounded base and a short stalk, 0.3-0.8 mm across and 10 mm long, with the stalk thinning distally from the flaring attachment at the base of the sponge. The stalk is composed of numerous fine diactine(?) spicules. Surface smooth, lack- ing any pronounced vertical or horizontal ribs or annuli. Description.-Numerous small, sack-shaped to globular sponges are in the collection. They are flattened in the black shale matrix and are preserved as pyritized or formerly pyritized, limonitic clay or limonite-stained clay impres- sions. Sponges range from small forms, 10 mm high and 7 mm across, to large forms approx- imately 30 mm high and 22 mm across. Most 1333</page><page sequence="10">J. KEITH RIGBY of the sponges are approximately 15-18 mm high and 12-14 mm across. All have a rounded base and a flat upper oscular rim. The skeletal wall is thin and with an open structure. A spongocoel extends from the circular, horizontal, oscular rim to the rounded base. Sponges start out with an al- most semicircular base, flare to approximately midheight, where they reach their maximum width, and then decrease in diameter in a rounded fashion to the oscular margin, ap- pearing almost like an egg with a sharply cut upper end, which forms the osculum. The holotype is approximately 18 mm tall and extends upward from a rounded base to a maximum diameter of approximately 14 mm, at midheight, but then decreases to a width of approximately 12 mm at the oscular rim. The same general proportions appear to apply to the small and large forms of the spe- cies represented in the collection. Surface of the wall is smooth, with no marked vertical or horizontal ribbing. In some there is weak suggestion of a slight flare at the immediate oscular margin, somewhat like the bowl of a thistle funnel in a chemistry labo- ratory. On most specimens, however, the flare is either wanting or very weak. The complete root tuft or stalk is not pre- served on most specimens but the flaring at- tachment of the stalk to the base of the sponge is preserved on virtually all of them. Part of the stalk, at least, is composed of numerous small spicules that are inserted only a short distance into the skeletal net, where they be- come tangential to the sponge surface. They converge distally and ultimately appear to grade into a stalk composed of only a few, possibly even one, long diactine spicules. On the holotype the upper part of the flare of the stalk is approximately 1.5 mm wide, where the small spicules become tangential to the main skeletal net. At approximately 2 mm, distally, the stalk is only 0.4 mm across. The same general proportions apply to the stalk of the paratypes. On one particular specimen (KU 107210) the more distal parts of the stalk are well preserved. At 5 mm, on this particular paratype, the stalk is 0.2 mm across and there is composed of three or possibly four or more, fine spicules. The impression of the thin stalk continues distally as a limonite-stained mold for an additional 5 mm, to where the impres- sion widens slightly, reaching a maximum width of 0.5 mm immediately proximal from a broad flare of a circular attachment, ap- proximately 3 mm in diameter. Because of the poor preservation of the distal part of the stalk, however, the nature of the spicule ar- rangement in the circular termination is ob- scure. On another paratype (KU 107217) what ap- pears to be a single large diactine extends a distance of approximately 10 mm distally from the flaring proximal portion of the stalk. Im- mediately below the proximal flare there ap- pears to be two poorly preserved spicules that converge distally. The distal termination is not evident on this specimen. Parietal gaps or prominent canals do not pierce the thin wall. The suggestion is that these sponges were of ascon grade, with water pouring directly between the rather widely spaced skeletal elements, comparatively speaking, into the spongocoel and then out the well defined osculum. The skeletal net is composed of regularly placed stauractine spicules, arranged in ver- tical and horizontal series such that the rec- tangular openings are formed by two rays of stauractines of either the horizontal or vertical series. Spicules are so arranged that they are from 2.5 to 2.8 mm apart, diagonally, on the holotype, and up to 3.5 mm apart in paratypes of approximately the same size. Spicules are up to 4 mm apart on one of the largest speci- mens in the collection. Such spacing produces square to rhomboidal openings 1.5-2.0 mm across. At midheight, and in the upper part of the sponge, the openings are slightly larger than in the rounded base, but the skeletal net proportions rather abruptly assume an aver- age dimension for the upper four-fifths of the sponges. Where best preserved, on the holotype and in other specimens, large first order staurac- tines have rays 1.5-1.7 mm long with a basal ray diameter of 0.14-0.18 mm. The rays are smooth and taper to sharp points in a uniform fashion. There is no evidence of proximal or distal rays on stauracts on any of the speci- mens. Rays of adjacent first order stauracts lie parallel to one another in the outer two-thirds of their extension and cross rays of adjacent spicules that are at right angles to them at ap- proximately two-thirds their ray lengths. On some specimens there appears to be some lon- gitudinal markings on the rays but, because of 1334</page><page sequence="11">CAMBRIAN SPONGES the preservation, it is difficult to tell whether this is indeed sculpture or merely the super- position of parallel small dermal rays that combine to produce a somewhat fibrous ap- pearance on some of the impressions. Spicules of second and third order ranking are obscure in the holotype and associated specimens of that particular slab, as well as in nearly all other specimens in the collection. Numerous small spicules, however, occupy the space within the first order quadrules. Most of the small spicules appear to have ray lengths of 0.4-0.6 mm and maximum basal ray diameters of approximately 0.02-0.03 mm. Spicules are finer than this, and some are coarser as well, in the net but the general fab- ric of the impressions is approximately of that proportion. These are fine stauractine and pos- sibly diactine spicules that fill in most of the open space between rays of the primary quad- rules. These small spicules are oriented par- allel to the first order elements and appear to overlie, that is to be external to them, in the general skeletal pattern. In one moderately well preserved fragment of a large representative of the species, smaller order spicules are present. Second order spic- ules are moderately well preserved and have ray lengths of 1.0-1.3 mm and maximum bas- al ray diameters of approximately 0.05-0.06 mm. These, like the first order forms, taper sharply and uniformly. In the same fragment, third order spicules have ray lengths of approximately 0.50 mm and basal ray diameters of 0.03-0.04 mm. Details of these small spicules are obscured, even where best preserved in this single frag- ment where second and third order spicules are obvious. Spicules smaller than third order ranking all appear to be of the same general dimensions and to be spaced almost ray by ray in a close thatch over the entire surface. It is this parallelism of small rays that gives a gen- eral appearance of weak bundling with the first and second order spicules. On most of the sponge impressions, however, rays and spic- ules smaller than the first order appear only as diagonally oriented, fine, moderately unifor- mally spaced lines or weak impressions, with these lines oriented parallel to the four rays of the major stauractines. In general the oscular rim is preserved as a cluster of pyritiferous masses or a general structureless mass of limonite-stained clay. In one specimen (BYU 1092), however, spicules of the oscular rim show moderately well. On this specimen upper rays of even the first order spicules are aborted so that the oscular rim is produced by the matted rays and the centers of the stauractines of the net. In some spicules there seems to be a shift of some rays from a diagonal to a horizontal orientation but this pattern is far from regular. There also appears to be some thickening of rays of those spicules whose centers do occur at the rim. Discussion.-In general shape Diagoniella robisoni appears similar to Protospongia co- ronata Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, p. 41, fig. 8). In detail, however, it differs markedly from this species described from the Metis beds of St. Lawrence valley. Diagoniella coronata has a well defined first order and second order ar- rangement to the spicules, but the first order quadrules are formed of rays of four spicules rather than two as in the Utah specimen. In addition, Diagoniella coronata has a conical hood of large curved marginalia that extend upward from the oscular rim, a feature want- ing in every specimen of the Utah collection. The root tufts of Diagoniella coronata are somewhat different from those preserved in the Utah material, for Diagoniella coronata appears to have two to four large diactines in the root tuft whereas numerous spicules occur in the proximal part of the tuft of Diagoniella robisoni. Diagoniella cyathiformis Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, p. 43, figs. 13, 14) has a skeletal pattern somewhat similar to Diagoniella robisoni but is a larger form, has a distinctly different root tuft system, and is much more conical than the ovoid almost circular Utah species. Diagoniella polynema Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, p. 42, figs. 11, 12) is described as a large form, occurring in flat shapeless masses sev- eral inches in diameter. Size alone would in- dicate that this species is different from the Utah species, but in addition Diagoniella po- lynema either has a very diffuse spicule tuft or pronounced marginalia whose spicules are ex- panded at their extremity. Diagoniella hindei Walcott (1920, p. 310- 311; pl. 81, figs. 1, la-c) is a conical form and appears to lack the prominent root tuft. At least remnants of the tuft are not visible in the specimens figured by Walcott, nor did he men- tion any evidence of a root tuft in his descrip- tion, although he pointed out that this species 1335</page><page sequence="12">J. KEITH RIGBY occurs in large numbers in the Middle Cam- brian Burgess Shale. Diagoniella hindei has a skeletal net apparently composed of very fine, threadlike spicules and, as such, appears to be distinctly finer textured than Diagoniella robisoni. In addition the Canadian species dif- fers in form and size from the Utah material.

Description.-Three moderate-sized frag- ments, plus two additional questionable frag- ments, of the species are represented in the collection. One of the better fragments (KU 107321) shows the form characteristic of the species, as described by Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, p. 43, fig. 13). The Utah specimen is a fragment approximately 27 mm tall and with a maximum width of approximately 18 mm. The base of the fragment is obscure and bro- ken, as is the upper part of the fragment on all the specimens. Fragments are preserved as limonite-replaced, pyritized, spicules in a tan- weathering, argillaceous limestone. As in the type specimen, the walls appear to be thin in the general conical form, with a skeletal net composed of ranked stauractines, arranged with rays oriented diagonally to the main axis. Stauract spicules of the skeletal net are ar- ranged in a series of ranks around the rhom- boidal openings. First order rhomboidal open- ings are enclosed by rays up to 4 mm long and with maximum diameters at the ray junction of approximately 0.2 mm. They are uniformly tapering, apparently to sharp tips, although the tips of only a few spicules can be identified in the moderately coarse pyritized preserva- tion. Second order spicules have ray lengths of 2.5-3.0 mm and maximum ray diameters, near the ray junctions, of 0.10-0.15 mm. These spicules, as is typical of the protospon- gids, are arranged parallel to but intervening between the first order spicules. Third order spicules are identifiable in a few spots and have spicule ray lengths of 1.5-1.7 mm and basal ray diameters of 0.08-0.10 mm. There is a suggestion of a fourth order series of spicules that have ray lenghts of approxi- mately 0.5 mm and basal ray diameters of 0.05-0.06 mm, but this series of spicules, like ones that are possibly of even finer and smaller rank, are lost in the coarse, somewhat knobby, pyritized preservation of the specimen. Spicules with ray lengths 0.3 mm long and with ray diameters of 0.04 mm occur in a few areas and are oriented as though they are fifth order spicules. These are exceedingly rare in the preservation. They are the finest spicules that can clearly be identified as discrete ele- ments in the net. First order quadrules are rhomboidal and are 4-5 mm across. Second order quadrules are 1.7-2.0 mm across and third order quad- rules are approximately 1-1.5 mm across. Fourth order quadrules, in the limited area where they are defined by pyritic masses, are 0.4-0.5 mm across. Some large diactine(?) marginalia or root tuft spicules are associated with the largest specimen. These spicules are up to 15 mm long and, as presently preserved, have maximum ray diameters of up to 0.3 mm across. They are oriented at odd angles to the fragment, but could be associated as armoring spicules. Their relationship is obscure because of the poor preservation, however, and is made even more uncertain because these spic- ules are associated with extraneous patches of protospongid skeletal net, obviously not now connected to the large conical fragment. Another large rectangular fragment (KU 107308) shows details of the skeletal net, yet outlines of the sponge are obscure. Because of details of the skeletal pattern this fragment is 1336</page><page sequence="13">CAMBRIAN SPONGES included within the species rather than as a spearate species or as a species of Protospon- gia. The specimen is a rectangular fragment approximately 45 mm square in which the spicules have been partially pyritized or are preserved as casts and molds in the general soft argillaceous matrix. In this specimen the quadrangular pattern is more nearly square, with rays at right angles, than in the smaller conical form. On this fragment first order quadrules are 4.5-5.0 mm across, and second order quadrules are 2.0-2.5 mm across. Third order quadrules are approximately 1.0-1.2 mm across in those areas where they are mod- erately well defined and, in some areas, fourth order quadrules 0.4-0.5 mm across are pre- served. Only in patches are spicules preserved as pyritized elements and on this part of the counterpart the quadrule arrangement is ob- scured by numerous, very small stauractine and stauractine-based spicules, and their casts and molds that appear to blanket the larger main skeletal elements. Many of the major skeletal elements appear as though the spicules were bundled. This I interpret as superposi- tion of fine dermal spicules over the main skel- etal elements, as they are preserved here. These small spicules are rarely preserved in- tact, but the numerous ray fragments, ar- ranged parallel to the larger fragments, are preserved and partially pyritized. These small rays are generally 0.01-0.015 mm across and individual rays on spicules this small are ob- servable with lengths up to approximatley 0.35-0.40 mm. They are most obvious where they have been superimposed or are parallel to the major skeletal units with which they are closely associated. Preservation of the fragment is similar to moderately well preserved specimens of Dia- goniella robisoni from part of the same collec- tion. It is conceivable that part of the major skeletal strands here are weakly bundled ma- jor stauractines with associated small staurac- tines and diactines. This could be one of the earliest developments of incipient dictyospon- gid type bundling. The specimens in question, however, are not sufficiently well preserved to be certain of this structure. Discussion.-Skeletal net and element sizes of the Utah specimens are essentially the same as those of the type material from Metis, de- scribed and figured by Dawson &amp; Hinde (1889, p. 43). Walcott (1920. p. 310) noted Diagon- iella cyathiformis as occurring in British Co- lumbia, approximately one mile northeast of Burgess Pass, in the Wapta Peak-Mount Field area. The Cambrian specimen of Walcott, however, has stauractine spicules with rays up to 11 mm long and forming primary meshes 7-8 mm across. This is much larger than meshes in the type material and in the Utah specimens. As such, the fragment identified as Diagoniella cyathiformis Dawson by Walcott is probably representative of a second larger species. Were it not for the complex dermal(?) layer of fine spicules and a similar skeletal de- velopment in specimens of Diagoniella robi- soni temptation would be strong to include the large fragment and its counterpart in Proto- spongia; however, the skeletal net character- istics appear distinctly different from that in excellent examples of Protospongia described by Rigby (1966), from slightly younger beds exposed a few miles to the south in the House Range. Available material.-Figured specimen, Kansas University 107304, and KU 107321, along with the counterpart of the former (KU 107306) are placed, without question, in the species, but two additional fragmental speci- mens (KU 107320 and 107323) are included with some reservation, because of their frag- mental nature and poor preservation.

E69, figs. 3a-e; SHIMER &amp; SHROCK, 1944, p. 53, PI. 16, fig. 11. Discussion.-Walcott (1920. p. 311-313) proposed the genus Kiwetinokia, designating Kiwetinokia utahensis as the type species, to include clusters of confused scattered spicules that occur on bedding planes of shaly, thin- bedded, limestone. He thought that these long, slender, spicular rods, which are asso- ciated with stauracts and a variety of trira- diate spicules, to be characteristic of species included in that genus. He noted (1920, p. 313) one minor bit of skeletal mesh, formed with four intact arranged cruciform spicules. These are associated with a variety of Y-shaped spic- ules, that have one long ray which may be spirally twisted and two short upward diverg- ing rays, and with a variety of disassociated stauractine spicules. 1337</page><page sequence="14">J.

Usage of Walcott's generic terminology is useful only for masses of spicules because the form of the sponge and the relation of these various spicules to each other is unknown. The Y-shaped spicules are probably remnants of root tufts and are the only moderately dis- tinctive spicules in the association, that is, spicules that do not occur widely in numerous contemporary genera and species. As a con- sequence, usage of Kiwetinokia, as a genus, probably should not be expanded. Clusters and masses of spicules strewn across bedding planes have been identified as Kiwetinokia utahensis Walcott, 1920. These clusters ap- pear in the lower part of the Wheeler Shale along the southwest side of the Wheeler Am- phitheater. (Small arrow, Text-fig. 1). Available material. Numerous slabs are in collections of the Department of Geology, Brigham Young University, all showing a mass of intermingled stauractine, triactine, and monactine spicules and spicule fragments. Most of these slabs are from the basal gray limestone of the Wheeler Shale, from the C, SW4, SE4, sec. 2, T17S, R13W, in the net, each showing a moderately regular geo- metric pattern of spacing and orientation. Spicules composed of sutured, discrete, thin- walled rays, which generally are collapsed. Description.-Only one moderately com- plete sponge and a few additional fragments of the skeletal net are preserved in the collec- tion. The holotype is a fragment of the lower part of a small, thin-walled sponge. It is part of a sponge at least 50 mm tall, with a rounded somewhat pointed base and an upper end ap- proximately 23 mm across. The sponge ex- pands uniformly and consistently upward throughout the length of the preserved frag- ment, but in the uppermost part, the rate of expansion appears to be slightly less as though the sponge is becoming more cylindrical. The sponge surface is smooth, not marked by either horizontal or vertical ribbing or annu- lation. Spicules in the holotype are small in com- parison to those of the paratypes and associ- ated disarticulated spicules. Spicules are ar- ranged in sweeping, spiraling, linear series in the lower part of the sponge, but become more nearly vertically stacked in the uppermost part of the fragment. Spicule size increases up- ward, as does the separation of spicules, from those spaced approximately 1.0-1.5 mm apart at the base, to those 2.0-2.5 mm apart in the upper part of the sponge. Increase in spacing is related both to separation between the as- cending spiraling series and separation be- tween spirals. Vertical increase in spicule size suggests that most other fragments in the col- lection are of the more adult stage of the 4 .7 1338</page><page sequence="15">CAMBRIAN SPONGES sponge, where elements are larger and spacing is wider. Spiculation in the holotype is prin- cipally of only first order elements, although some small, second order fragments do occur. These also show on the counterpart as single small rays or occasionally as two or three ar- ticulated tangential rays. Three fragments show several spicules with moderately consis- tent orientation. Other specimens consist only of isolated spicules or of a few patches of ir- regularly oriented spicules. Orientation of the skeletal net fragments becomes moderately certain after comparison with the holotype and with illustrations and description of Chancel- loria eros Walcott (1920, p. 329-331; pl. 88; figs. 1, la-f). Individual spicules are composed of five and occasionally six tangential rays in a plane, ra- diating from a central disc or button, which appears to represent aborted distal and prox- imal rays now preserved as rounded subspher- ical to elliptical thin-walled balls. The five tan- gential rays are arranged two in a radiating and ascending pattern, two lateral and gently ascending, and one ray descending. The central disc or button of the distal- proximal rays ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 mm in the holotype and 0.6 to 0.8 mm in diameter in the main body spicules of the paratypes. The discs appear nearly circular in plan view but are somewhat elliptical when viewed from the side. These are thin walled, with the individ- ual walls of the hollow spherical mass 0.08- 0.10 mm thick. The five tangential rays articulate with somewhat arcuate surfaces to the central cir- cular disc and, in addition, articulate along a moderately smooth surface with basal parts of adjacent spicules for a distance of 0.03-0.05 mm along individual facets in the largest spic- ules. Descending rays appear to be nearly straight with maximum width of 1.2-1.4 mm at the articulating junction with the adjacent rays. The ray thins distally, in a uniform way, to a moderately sharp point at a distance of 4- 5 mm from the articulating junction, or 5-6 mm from the junction of the ray with the rounded central disc. Spicules in the holotype are considerably smaller with the descending rays 1.1-1.4 mm long and only 0.2 mm across at their base. Two lateral rays initially diverge down- wards at angles of approximately 60? to the descending ray, but then gently sweep upward A B TEXT-FIG. 4-Chancelloria pentacta new species, paratype, UCLA 38952.

KEITH RIGBY and outward to a horizontal position. Ray tips curve slightly upwards in most forms. Where complete, these rays have a maximum width at the articulating facet of 0.8-1.0 mm and have ray lengths of 4-5 mm in the paratypes but are only 0.2-0.3 mm wide and up to 1.5 mm long in the holotype. The slightly descend- ing lateral rays of the spicule are the most com- monly curved rays. The two ascending rays in the holotype are up to 2.5 mm long and have maximum width of 0.3 mm. Those of the paratypes have a maximum width of approximately 1.0 mm at the articulating base but taper very quickly to a sharply pointed tip. These rays have a max- imum ray length of 3.5-4.5 mm, out from the articulating surface, and 4.0-4.5 mm out from the central disc button. The two ascending rays are moderately straight in the proximal part of the ray but curve gently so that the tips of the ray rise more or less vertically and thus swing through 20-30? of arc in the middle and outer part of the ray. All of the tangential rays appear to have been hollow. Most show a median furrow pro- duced by collapse of the hollow structure. This furrow generally extends from near the artic- ulation of the rays with the central disc to near the sharpened, somewhat rounded tip, vir- tually the full length of the ray. Where evident in the somewhat argillaceous and limonitic preservation, walls of individual rays appear to be approximately 0.10 mm thick, which would suggest a central opening as much as 0.8 mm in diameter at the ray base on the largest spicules. On spicules that are available, the round holes through the ray wall described by Wal- cott (1920, p. 330) and Sdzuy (1969, p. 117- 118, fig. 1) are not evident. Preservation of the Utah chancellorid spicules is moderately poor, however, and have obviously undergone con- siderable alteration, from calcium carbonate to pyrite, to argillaceous limonite. On the most extensive fragment of skeletal net of one of the paratypes (KU 107236) there is a second order series of spicules. These have a maximum ray width of 0.4-0.5 mm and a maximum length of 2.0-2.5 mm. These spic- ules are interspersed among the larger main body spicules and seem to have the same gen- eral orientation and shape. They have two gently curved ascending rays, two strongly curved lateral rays, and one descending, mod- erately straight tapering ray. The central discs representing the aborted proximal-distal rays are approximately 0.3 mm in diameter, but are certainly less well defined and preserved than discs of the larger rank of spicules. There is also some suggestion of still smaller spicules on the same specimen, with maximum ray widths of 0.20 mm, but these are poorly preserved and present only in irregular patch- es and as fragmented rays in some of the spec- imens. From the material vailable it is impos- sible to tell whether the smaller spicules are internal or external to the large spicules. The smaller spicules still show the collapsed central furrow indicating that they too were hollow structures. Where the skeleton appears to have been least disturbed ascending rays of two laterally adjacent spicules cross near their tips. Ray tips overlie immediately superior spicules approx- imately midway along the ray lengths. De- scending rays appear to lie inside the ascend- ing rays. This is essentially the same pattern as illustrated by Walcott (1920, pl. 88, figs. 1, le) in Chancelloria eros where the forklike as- cending rays appear to be inclined slightly out- ward from the axis of the sponge. Lateral rays are more or less tangential to the circumfer- ence of the sponge, but descending rays are inclined inwards, into the sponge body wall. The larger spicules appear to be geometri- cally moderately well placed in ascending se- ries, with rays that partially overlap at their distal edges. Spicule centers are moderately rhombically arranged and also appear to be in vertically aligned series, with the descending ray of a superior spicule extending down to near the ray junction of one of the inferior spicules but inside the sponge wall. The pat- tern is not consistently regular, however, and the great regularity developed in the Proto- spongiidae, for example, isn't clearly expressed here. In one patch of skeleton (KU 107236) the smaller second order spicules appear to be placed with their ray junctions in the void be- tween the roughly rectangularly placed first order spicules. This is a pattern somewhat like that seen in Eiffelia and in Zangerlispongia and would be expected in some of the more advanced chancellorids. In that same patch of skeleton the smaller spicules appear to overlie, that is to be exterior to, the larger spicules. Only a few spicules can be observed without 1340</page><page sequence="17">CAMBRIAN SPONGES question, however, and at no place are the smaller spicules overlain by the larger ones. It thus appears that the smaller spicules are the exterior ones on the outside of the main body wall. Discussion.-Walcott (1920, p. 327, 329- 330) initially described Chancelloria eros Wal- cott as having spicules with 4-7 rays. In gen- eral, spicules of the species illustrated by Wal- cott are relatively narrow, moderately delicate, long-rayed forms, somewhat less robust than in the Utah material. In addition virtually all of the spicules illustrated by Walcott have six to seven rays. It would thus appear that the main skeletal net of Chancelloria eros is com- posed of spicules with six tangential rays in contrast to the spicules almost totally with five tangential rays in the Utah specimens of Chan- celloria pentacta n. sp. In addition, the spic- ules of Chancelloria eros appear to be slightly smaller, for Walcott listed the two exposed rays, the ascending rays in the present inter- pretation, with average lengths of 2.5-3.0 mm in the upper part of the sponge and 1.5-2 mm in the lower part. He also noted the occurrence of some small-sized six-rayed associated spic- ules, 3 mm in diameter and with ray lengths of approximately 1.25 mm (Walcott, 1920, p. 33). Chancelloria drusilla Walcott (1920, p. 331- 332) is a somewhat larger spiculed form, but spicules of this species appear consistently to have six or seven, radiating, tangential rays. Chancelloria libo Walcott (1920, p. 332) has eight rays in a peculiar arrangement and is distinctly different from the Utah specimens. Chancelloria yorkensis Walcott (1920, p. 332- 333) appears to be even a more slender, deli- cate form than Chancelloria eros Walcott. As a consequence it would be considerably more delicate and thin rayed than the types of Chan- celloria pentacta. Because of the fragmental nature of the type material of Chancelloria yorkensis detailed comparison with that spe- cies is not possible. Chancelloria moroccana Sdzuy (1969, p. 129-131) is known from many isolated frag- ments of spicules and is characterized by a dominance of spicules with six rays, fewer spicules with five tangential rays with one ver- tical ray. Some less common spicules of the species have seven tangential rays and one vertical ray or others have four or five tangen- tial rays and possess or lack vertical rays. A great variation in numbers of rays differs from the more or less consistent pattern of spicules with five tangential rays and with vertical or proximal-distal rays seen in the Utah materi- al. Sdzuy (1969, p. 119) noted that Allonia tri- podophora Dore &amp; Reid (1965) is characterized by spicules with three horizontal or tangential rays but which lack a proximal distal ray. Ar- chiasterella pentactina Sdzuy (1969) is char- acterized by spicules which have five tangen- tial rays but which lack proximal or distal rays. Eiffelia globosa Walcott (1920) characteris- tically has six horizontal rays plus one or two vertical rays. Various species of Chancelloria have seven or eight horizontal or tangential rays and one vertical ray. Eiffelia and Chan- celloria are not differentiated on the basis of number of rays but on the shape and arrange- ment of the spicules in the sponges. In the schematic diagram of Archiasterella pentactina Sdzuy (1969, p. 135, fig. 3) showed a somewhat anthropomorphic orientation of the spicules. If the orientation of spicules in Chancelloria eros Walcott (1920, P1. 88, figs. 1, lc-le) is typical of the group then the spic- ules shown for Archiasterella by Szduy should probably be inverted. The more or less straight leglike rays are possibly ascending rays, the curved armlike rays are possibly lat- eral rays, and the blunt aborted ray is possibly a short descending ray. Type specimens.-The holotype (BYU 925) and its counterpart (BYU 924) plus the para- types (KU 107236, KU 107234 and UCLA 38952) and KU 107315 and KU 107316 show some moderately intact skeletal net. In addi- tion 12 other specimens show isolated spicules referable to this species. All of these came from the Harris quarry.

KEITH RIGBY 4 . it 1 2mm TEXT-FIG. 5-Generalized and somewhat restored spicules of Chancelloria eros Walcott, 1920. Most of the spicules of this species have six rays, al- though some five-rayed and four-rayed spicules do occur, particularly as second and third order spicules. In some the rays are aborted or short stubs. Almost all of the large body spicules show collapsed depressions where the hollow rays have been deformed during fossilization. The upper- most spicule may be shown upside down from its original position in the skeletal net, as suggested by the curvature of the main rays. The small auxiliary spicule, which lacks the distal-proximal rays, in the lower right, is similar to those typical of the genus Archiasterella (Sdzuy, 1969). The archiasterellid-like spicules are rare in this genus. Proximal refers to the base of the sponge and distal to the oscular rim. Scale is approximate. Description.-A single moderately well pre- served specimen (KU 107235) is in the collec- tion. It is fragmental and is a cluster of some- what disarticulated spicules, rather than a piece of a well organized skeletal net, for spic- ules in various parts of the fragment are ori- ented at 180? to one another. Individual spicules are composed of six and occasionally five radiating, equally spaced, tangential rays that diverge from a central, round disc that, presumably, represents the distal-proximal ray. The central rounded disc ranges from 0.7 to 0.9 mm in diameter, is low and somewhat hemispherical, with depressed margins where the radiating rays articulate with it. Most of the tangential rays have max- imum ray widths of 0.6-0.7 mm at their bases, at the point where they articulate. The sutured articulating surface between adjacent tangen- tial rays is from 0.3-0.4 mm long. Basal suture of the tangential rays with the central disc is arcuate and over a distance of 0.4-0.5 mm. Ascending rays are up to 3.5 mm long and taper uniformly from the rather flaring attach- ment, in the inner 0.3-0.4 mm of the ray, to a rounded to pointed tip, where best seen in the argillaceous preservation. Ascending rays curve through approximately 20? as they swing to subparallel one another. The two lat- eral rays are slightly descending but curve through as much as 30? to where the ray tips ascend and sweep upward. They are up to 2.5-3.0 mm long. Descending rays are 3.0-3.5 mm long and are moderately straight, al- though they may curve through as much as 15? in the outer one-quarter or one-fifth of the ray. Smaller second order spicules are associated with large ones in an irregular thatch. These forms have basal diameters of 0.4-0.5 mm and may have rays 1.8-2.0 mm long from the basal articulation with the rounded central disc. The disc has an average diameter of 0.4-0.5 mm. The second order spicules are less well pre- served than larger spicules but apparently have somewhat straighter rays, so that even the gently curved lateral rays and the ascend- ing rays are moderately straight, for at least the inner one-half of the ray where they are preserved. Some rays show gentle curves through 5? or 10? in the outer one-third of the ray. A third order of spicules is present, with maximum ray diameters of 0.25-0.30 mm and ray lengths of approximately 1 mm. These small spicules are highly fragmented in the available specimen and are poorly preserved. It is difficult to tell whether complete third order spicules have the characteristic six tan- gential rays. The central disc is obscurely pre- served in the argillaceous limonitic-stained mass. Spacing and orientation of individual spic- ules are irregular. The massive spicules appear to have suffered some postmortem shift in the sponge wall fragments. A single Archiasterella-like spicule is noted in the single cluster. Two of the rays are pre- served as limonite-filled impressions, but the 1342</page><page sequence="19">CAMBRIAN SPONGES other two, of the four rays present in the spic- ule, are preserved only as impressions in the dark limestone. The most complete is approx- imately 1.1 mm long and has a maximum bas- al diameter of approximately 0.35 mm, at the point where the spicules begin to narrow at the basal facet. Rays articulate with the other of the four rays in a peculiar somewhat X-shaped junction. Two of the opposed rays articulate along their common flat base, but two of the rays do not meet the opposite ray and articulate with a basal V-shaped facet to truncated margins of the adjacent spicules. In- dividual rays taper smoothly to moderately sharp tips, as seen in the one nearly complete ray. Individual rays are apparently thin walled, with a wall thickness of approximately 0.01-0.02 mm, judging from the impression of the wall in the articulating facets where the four spicules merge. Central linear depressions are also evident on these rays, as in rays of other larger body spicules, and are caused by collapse of the thin conicocylindrical walls during compaction. Discussion.-Six-rayed chancellorid spic- ules in the Utah collections are similar to those of Chancelloria eros Walcott (1920, p. 327, 329-330), described from the Burgess Shale in Canada. The Utah specimen is included in that species. Spicules from the Wheeler Shale have the curvature and the general dimensions of that species, but appear to be of slightly different dimension and shape than seen in Chancelloria moroccana Sdzuy (1969). Available material.-A single fragment (KU 107235) with a cluster of mainly six-rayed chancellorid spicules is in the collection. These show the characteristic collapsed furrow on the rays. Spicules are of the same general di- mensions, in terms of wall thickness and cen- tral opening size, as the new five-rayed Chan- celloria pentacta. CHANCELLORIA sp. Text-fig. 6 Description.-A single specimen composed of disassociated large spicule elements occurs in the collection. Various rays of spicule com- plexes are separated, or are incomplete, such that the numbers of rays in any one complete spicule is unknown. However, there is a gen- eral broad sweep to what are thought to be ascending rays in the skeletal element. The distinctive feature of these skeletal ele- TEXT-FIG. 6-Large spicules of Chancelloria sp. from the Wheeler Shale, Harris quarry, House Range. These large-rayed skeletal elements are double the size of other spicules of the genus known in western North America. KU 111762. X2. ments is their large size, with individual rays up to 9.5 mm long. Some of the larger rays have basal ray diameters at the facet of 1.2- 1.3 mm. They are typical thin-walled, some- what compressed oblate rays. They gently curve through approximately 60?, from the flaring faceted base to the moderately sharp tip. All the rays show linear collapse depres- sions, indicating their original relatively thin- walled construction. In only a few rays is the definite basal ray attachment preserved. In these the flaring bas- al attachment is 0.8 mm across. Ray diameter decreases abruptly approximately 1 mm dis- tally from the base, but beyond here the rays taper relatively uniformly to the sharp spicule tips. In some ray clusters there is a suggestion of six rays articulating to a central disc, but in others the central disc may be missing, with rays articulating at basal facets, in contact with adjacent rays, as in Archiasterella. In some spicules there may be only four rays. Because of the fragmental nature of material, however, it is impossible to be certain. Discussion.-These fragments of spicules are among the largest fragments of chancel- lorid spicules known. They are at least twice as large as any other spicules of Chancelloria 1343</page><page sequence="20">J. KEITH RIGBY in the collection. The general pattern of ver- tical increase in size, up a somewhat conical cylindrical sponge, would suggest that these are spicules from near the top of a moderately large and relatively old individual. Elements of the skeletal net appear with a moderately consistent orientation, which would suggest that the fossil is not a scatolog- ical assemblage, but merely one in which a fragment of the net has been crushed and dis- torted at a peculiar angle. The sponge frag- ment initially was not parallel to the sea bot- tom, but apparently was buried at some moderately high angle. It has been crushed diagonally during fossilization. Figured specimen.-Kansas University 111762.
