In his second volume, which is devoted to the.study of the six Brah- manical systems, Professor Radhakrishnan exhibits the characteristics</page><page sequence="2">IIo INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS which marked out his first volume as an important and valuable contribu- tion to the understanding of Indian thought. He frankly claims to have adopted "what is acknowledged to be, the true spirit of philosophical in- terpretation, viz., to interpret the ancient writers and their thoughts at their best and relate them to the living issues of philosophy and religion." It is possible to take exception to this conception of the function of the historian of philosophy; and to ask that he should interpret the writers of the past dispassionately rather than seek to exhibit their strength; and it is impossible, during the perusal of this interesting work, to avoid the conviction that, in relating Indian thought to modern ideas, there is more than a risk of obscuring what is characteristic in it, and that the presen- tation is somewhat one-sided. Though we may readily admit that the problem set to philosophers is one and the same, nevertheless it has been approached in very diverse ways by Indian philosophers, and undoubted- ly there is need of an exposition of Indian philosophy which will take as its fundamental object the presentation of what is specifically individual in the tenets of the systems. This is not the prime aim of Professor Rad- hakrishnan. Deeply versed in Western philosophy, he finds a wide field for his talent in expounding Indian doctrines in the light of modern dis- cussions. The result unquestionably is far more interesting than any his- tory of Indian philosophy can be, if it adheres closely to the thought of the ancient writers. They grew up without knowledge of Greek philos- ophy, and the religious mysticism of the Upanishads forms the basis of the most valuable of their speculations; to interpret even Qankara in the light of Hegel is distinctly to modernize and reconstruct rather than ex- pound. Professor Radhakrishnan ascribes to Qankara's system "elemen- tal calm and persuasiveness of rational conviction" (p. 655). But this is hardly the impression left by the writings of Gankara himself; it is doubtless of interest to compare Bradley's view of the Absolute with that of Qankara (p. 638), but it is essential to remember that Qankara, unlike Bradley, accepts without reserve as authoritative the teachings of the Upanishads, and there is a great gulf fixed between the thinker who is bound by no authority and him who is fettered. Again we are told that Qankara's "repugnance to anthropomorphism makes his religion appear a little cold." But Gankara's religion consisted in the full recognition of the popular theism of his day, which was not in the slightest degree cold, and which he appears to have industriously propagated. A follower of his doctrines has thus not the slightest difficulty in finding satisfaction for his religious needs, nor is he in the least illogical in doing so. Again it is said (p. 654) that "by the inculcation of his Advaita doctrine, he helped men to interpret God in terms of spiritual value." It is difficult to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS III discover any authority for this view, which does not appear to stand in any logical relation with Qankara's thought, and, what is far more important, seems to be wholly without support in anything written by Qankara, voluminous as are his works. It seems impossible to agree that Gankara "would in a manner indorse Spinoza's dictum that he who truly loves God cannot wish that God should love him in return." There is no proper sense in which the Absolute of Gankara can be deemed God, and in the lower sphere of existence love of God unquestionably would expect to be requited. When, therefore, Professor Radhakrishnan urges (pp. 778 ff.) the revival of Indian philosophy in India, it is not the traditional doctrines as understood, for instance by Madhava in the fourteenth century, that he would see once more in honor, but these doctrines viewed in the light of Western philosophy, and, it may be confessed, transmuted in the proc- ess into something which probably would have been difficult of accep- tance by the sages to whom they are attributed by the author. But the work also contains very much that is not unduly colored by Professor Radhakrishnan's own philosophic view, while his very real power of ex- position adds to its value, and his frequent reference to modern specula- tion conveys a perhaps delusive sense of familiarity to ancient doctrines. Moreover, though not, in the strict sense of the term, learned, the work is normally very well informed, and it constitutes beyond doubt a very valuable addition to the literature of Indian philosophy. It is all the more meritorious because at present there is a dearth of detailed studies on the basis of which alone is it possible to construct with security and reasonable ease. All attempts at present to write histories of Indian thought as a whole are necessarily in a degree premature, but they serve a most useful function in calling attention to the serious gaps in our knowledge, and the innumerable problems still demanding solution, The steady progress of research in India will doubtless in due course make good these defects. On points of detail, as is inevitable, divergence of view is often pos- sible. Sometimes Professor Radhakrishnan is too ready to follow tradi- tion; it is really impossible to believe (p. i8) that the Kautiliya dates from 300 B.C.; it is most improbable that the Gankara who commented on the Gaudapddiya Karikd was the great ?ankara; and that there was a historical Kapila, author of the Samkhya, is contrary to all probability. It may gratify feminists to learn of Gdrg! as a great thinker (p. 78i); but they will do well to remember that her historical existence in this ca- pacity is unproved, and to accord this description to Mahavira appears a</page><page sequence="4">II2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS gratuitous compliment, for it would be difficult to find in early Jainism, even if we attribute what it has of philosophy to Mahavlra, anything that could by any effort of the imagination be styled serious thought.
