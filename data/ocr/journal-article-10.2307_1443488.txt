<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND COMMENTS THE AMATEUR ZOOLOGIST'S GUIDE TO TURTLES AND CROCODILES. By Robert T. Zappalorti. Stackpole Books, Cameron and Kelker Streets, Harrisburg, PA 17105. 208 pp., 138 figs. (44 color), $12.95.-The amateur zool- ogist, young or old, will find this book informa- tive in both text and illustrations. The author uses many personal experiences to amplify the ecological and behavioral traits of the croco- dilians and turtles while making a plea for their conservation. The crocodilians make up the first of three parts to this book, the turtles the second, while the third consists of appendicies listing herpe- tological societies, herpetological terms, metric and temperature conversion tables and litera- ture cited; the latter does not list certain refer- ences given in the text. The tuatara and its habits are briefly de- scribed. The crocodilians are treated in length with a list of the living species in the world. The turtles are covered as snapping turtles, musk and mud turtles, aquatic, semiaquatic and box turtles, desert and gopher tortoises, sea turtles, and soft-shelled turtles, and care of pet turtles and tortoises. The discussions treat the turtles at the species level or a particular sub- species most familiar to the author. As the title indicates, this book will be an aid and stimulus to the amateur zoologist, but I am sure many experienced herpetologists will find useful information in the author's experi- ences and will find the illustrations helpful.- CHARLES C.

McClelland and Stewart, Ltd., 25 Hollinger Rd., Toronto, Ontario, M4B 3G2, Canada. 120 pp., 50 figs. (16 color), $8.95.-This small, attractively composed book is quite liter- ally the product of a long-protracted labor of love. To those who have never been exposed to the endearing qualities of captive ("pet") turtles, the affection they elicit from their owners is a bit bewildering, and the often sentimental, anthropomorphic accounts of these relationships are frequently regarded as shallowly emotional and somewhat abnormal. Far too many people react the same, intrigued way to turtles, how- ever, to justify categorization of cheloniophilia as anything except typical when circumstances are favorable. It is nevertheless seldom indeed that a healthy concern for turtles, which Froom certainly has, is carried to such a level of sophis- tication as is documented in the present book. Tapping extremely varied sources of informa- tion, including a very considerable personal experience maintaining turtles in captivity and acting as one of Canada's few professional her- petologists, the author (who founded and has been the primary impetus for the Canadian Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Society, Canada's only herpetological association) has aimed in this book to present a balanced per- spective of turtles for the non-specialist: 1) an aid to identification of Canada's 10 inland and 4 sea turtle species; 2) a summary of salient background information on turtles in general; 3) a more detailed specification of habitat, habits, characteristics and distribution of each of the Canadian species; and 4) a guide to the care of turtles in captivity. Overall, the objec- tive has been to evoke interest in and concern for turtles as broadly as possible; without them conservation is not possible, and conservation is never far from uppermost in the author's mind. Such concern is a ready product of the marginal existence eked out by all reptiles, including turtles, in the rigorous climate characteristic of Canada. All 14 species treated are illustrated by color- photo reproductions of exceptionally high qual- ity, as well as by a number of black and white photographs. Nine chapters concern 1) the origin of turtles; 2) myth and legend; 3) physi- cal characteristics and adaptations; 4) large turtles (Chelydra s. serpentina, Trionyx s. spi- niferus); 5) medium turtles (Chrysemys picta of 3 subspp., Malaclemys geographica, Emys bland- ingi, Clemmys insculpta, Terrapene c. carolina); 6) small turtles (Clemmys m. marmorata, C. gut- tata, Sternotherus odoratus); 7) sea turtles (Che- lonia mydas agassizi, Lepidochelys olivacea kempi, Caretta c. caretta, Dermochelys coriacea of 2 subspp.); 8) turtles as pets; and 9) con- servation of turtles. A 2-page list of 21 varied references on turtles terminates the book. 843</page><page sequence="2">COPEIA, 1976, NO. 4 Sprinkled here and there are carefully chosen quotations from poets and other writers. "The Turtles of Canada" is a fitting sequel to Froom's "The Snakes of Canada," and leads one to hope that perhaps the author will complete the series for the herpetofauna of Canada. The only detail not incorporated in the present vol- ume that one might hope for in future ones is a spot distribution map for each species, up- dating the most recent, 15-year old compendium now available. The content of this book shows exercise of great care in assuring factual reli- ability and freedom from typographic lapses; it is a thoroughly polished work of both scholar- ship and art. Because of its broad applicability to pets, to conservation, to turtles in general and to those of northeastern North America in particular, where a number of species prized as pets occur, this elegant tribute to one of the most appealing of the rapidly waning segments of our biota is highly recommended to all confirmed and po- tential cheloniophiles, irrespective of location.- HOBART M. SMITH, Department of Environ- mental, Population and Organismic Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309. THE FISHES OF MISSOURI. By William L. Pflieger. Missouri Department of Conservation, P.O. Box 180, Jefferson City, MO 65701. 1975. viii + 343 pp. profusely illustrated (including 16 color plates with 40 figs.). $10.00 hard- cover, $7.50 softcover.-The book under review achieves a quality level equivalent to Traut- man's Fishes of Ohio and Cross' Fishes of Kan- sas. Excellence would be expected in a book that is an outgrowth of Pflieger's 1971 Distribu- tional Study of Missouri Fishes published in the University of Kansas Publications. Certainly, this is a first rate professional publication. The book includes 20 pp. (each page is 17 X 24 cm) of introductory material, 2 pp. of glos- sary, 8 pp. of references cited, 6 pp. of index, 13 pp. of key to families. Most of the text (275 pp.) is devoted to discussion of families and spe- cies. Included in this section are keys to each species. The double column format permits each couplet to be illustrated in the right hand column. Those couplets that key out a species have a line drawing of that species as part (or all) of the illustration. Each species account has a map with locality records (pre-1905, 1905-1945 and 1946 to present distinguished) plotted and Pflieger's distributional concepts shown by tan shading, description, distribution and habitat, habits and life history, and where applicable im- portance and angling. The sections are well done. My preferences for coverage might differ in detail from those presented by Dr. Pflieger but his presentation is substantial, meaningful and well balanced. My criticisms are trivial: I prefer photographs to line drawings to illustrate fishes; fish sizes should be in metric units rather than English units; some pages notably p. 34 could have been put to better use (in contrast the insides of both the front and back cover include quite useful illustrations). A comparison between Pflieger's present dis- cussions and those published in 1971 shows one striking change. The grass carp was not col- lected in Missouri until after the 1971 report went to press but in the 1975 version this species was reported from more than 50 widely scattered localities. Pflieger properly points out that the release of this exotic is controversial and that the impact may not be fully understood for many years. The presence of the grass carp in Missouri is the result of releases made elsewhere in the Mississippi Valley. Perhaps the most unfortunate item is that Missouri regulatory authorities were unable to participate in the deliberations that led to a release that now has caused an effect on Missouri fisheries resources. -C.H. 844</page></plain_text>
