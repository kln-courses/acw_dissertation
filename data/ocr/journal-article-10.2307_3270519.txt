<plain_text><page sequence="1">DID THE HINDUS LACK A SENSE OF HISTORY? ARVIND SHARMA Summary The view that the Hindus do not possess a sense of history has become so commonplace as to virtually achieve the status of an axiom in the study of Indic religion and culture. It is the argument of this paper that this view may stand in need of revision in the light of the epigraphic, literary, and even artisitic evidence presented therein, specially when it is assessed in the context of the various foreign invasions to which India has been subject. The view that Hinduism as a religion, or the Hindus as a people, lack a sense of history has been expressed so often as to have become a clich6 (Basham 1975:54; Pitt 1958:20; McCrindle 1960:10; Ghosal 1965:1).1 Even when scholars have tried to take a more sophisticated as opposed to a clich6d view, the effect has often been to reinforce it. Professor A.L. Basham, for instance, would concede to the Hindus a sense of the past, but still not of history (1999:44). Elsewhere he allows for a sense of antiquity, if only to suggest that Hinduism possessed an exaggerated sense of it (Basham 1999:4), while some have argued that Hinduism possessed a sense of historical pessimism but, again, not of history (Klostermaier 1994:117). Even when scholars take a more nuanced view and distinguish between: (1) lack of chronology (Pitt 1958:20), (2) lack of history (McCrindle 1960:109; Aiyangar 1941:145; Mill 1975:35), (3) lack of sense of history (Aiyangar 1941:416), (4) lack of historiography (Majumdar 1952:47-51), and (5) the lack of a theory of history (Asthana 1992:20), the net effect is the same. The alleged lack of historiography and a theory of history in India only buttresses the 1 No less than over sixty references to this effect can be documented. ?

Similarly, when Hinduism is compared to other religions of Indian origin, such as Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism, it suffers by this com- parison, in the sense that these latter religions are usually represented as being endowed, at least relatively to Hinduism, with a greater or better sense of history. It is then noted that the Mahdvania and the DTpavansa record the history of Buddhism in Sri Lafika (Basham 1964:46); the death of Lord Mahavira initiates a historical era in Jain- ism (Jaini 1979:37-38) and not only is Sikhism's history relatively re- cent and well documented (Singh 1966; Embree 1988:493), a sense of history within it is also manifest (Cole and Sambhi 1998:8). The aim of this paper is to examine the thesis that Hindus lacked a sense of history on the basis of the evidence on this point available to us from ancient and, at times, medieval India. Out of the five senses in which the claim that the Hindus lacked a sense of history, namely as indicating a lack of chronology, history, "sense" of history, historiography and theory of history, can be made, this paper will focus on only one understanding of it, namely, the lack of historical sense. This is not to deny that all the five dimensions are interconnected and mutually relevant. Indeed they will all be engaged but only as they bear on the presence or absence of a "sense" of history. As each of the five senses could constitute the theme of a paper by itself, we wish to place the issue of the absence or presence of a historical sense centrestage, in order to make our undertaking more precise and the outcome more definite. It might be useful to specify what we mean by "sense" of history or "historical sense" before we proceed further. In this matter, we shall follow the lead provided by Romila Thapar. She writes (1978:268): Since much of the argument hinges on the definition of a sense of history, let me begin by suggesting a definition. A sense of history can be defined as a consciousness of past events, which events are relevant to a particular society, seen in a chronological framework and expressed in a form which meets the needs of that society. It may be argued that this is too restricted a definition and that history implies a concern with political events and, in addition, involves</page><page sequence="3">192 Arvind Sharma the analysis of past events by suggesting causal relationships based on rational explanation and which, therefore, assumes a critical judgement on the past by the historian. It is, however, debatable whether this extension of the definition of an historical sense is not a product of modem thinking, and where such historical writing does exist in ancient cultures (as indeed it does even in the Indian tradition at a later period), it is not a consciously thought-out philosophy of history but the result of an individual and rather analytical mind applying itself to historical narrative. I The place to look for a historical sense, if any, among Hindus, one would imagine, would not so much be the religious literature of the Hindus, with the Brihmanas acting as its custodians and maintaining it through oral transmission. For if Hinduism does not attach the same theological or teleological value to history as the Abrahamic religions and secular Western culture are wont to, then this is obviously not the most promising place to look for it. One should instead turn to the records left behind by those who made history in India as elsewhere: the rulers: The favoured medium in which the rulers of India left behind their records are inscriptions. About 90.000 inscriptions have so far been discovered in differ- ent parts of India, out of which the largest numbers come from the Tamil-, Kannada-, and Telegu-speaking areas--about 35.000, 17.000 and 10.000 re- spectively. Many of these inscriptions have not yet been published. Every year new inscriptions are being discovered and studied, and our knowledge of early Indian history is being gradually widened.... The popular belief that all im- portant inscriptions have already been discovered, studied and utilised for the reconstruction of history is wrong. .. (Sircar 1977:91) Whether the Hindus did or did not posses a sense of history - or geography for that matter, will then have to be determined by an examination of these inscriptions. The importance of these inscriptions in the reconstruction of ancient Indian history has been recognized for over a century now, if not longer. Vincent A. Smith writes: Inscriptions have been given the first place in the list because they are, on the whole, the most important and trustworthy source of our knowledge. Unfortu-</page><page sequence="4">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 193 nately, they do not at present go further back than the third century BC with certainty, although it is not unlikely that records considerably earlier may be dis- covered, and it is possible that a very few known documents may go back beyond the reign of Asoka. Indian inscriptions, which usually are incised on either stone or metal, may be either official documents set forth by kings or other authorities, or records made by private persons for various purposes. Most of the inscriptions on stone either commemorate particular events or record the dedication of build- ings or images. The commemorative documents range from the simple signature of a pilgrim to long and elaborate Sanskrit poems detailing the achievements of victorious kings. Such poems are called prasasti. The inscriptions on metal are for the most part grants of land inscribed on plates of copper. They are some- times extremely long, especially in the south, and usually include information about the reigning king and his ancestors. Exact knowledge of the dates of events in early Hindu history, so far as it has been attained, rests chiefly on the testimony of inscriptions. (Smith 1923:xvi-xvii)2 Notwithstanding this tribute, epigraphic evidence on the question of the sense of history as found among the Hindus does suffer from certain limitations. As already noted in the passage just cited, very few known documents go back beyond the reign of Asoka, that is, beyond the third century BC. They are often dated in the regnal year of the king, and when obviously not so, the era is not specified. Moreover, their distribution over the country is not even, although the fact that they relatively abound in those areas where Islamic rule took longest to penetrate invites the proposition that they may also have suffered iconoclastic destruction, in keeping with the pattern of the relative paucity of such evidence from the Hindu period available from areas under prolonged Islamic rule (Spear 1994:15). The stylistic formalism of epigraphic commemorative literature (stuti) may also at times compromise factual and geographical exactitude, or even truth (Sircar 197 l1a: 1-2). Nevertheless, despite these handicaps, they remain a rich resource for assessing a sense of history among the Hindus. A review of two of such well-known inscriptions: the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman (c. 190 AD) and the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta (c. 350 AD) might be helpful in this connection. 2 The passage has been retained intact in Spear 1994:13.</page><page sequence="5">194 Arvind Sharma The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman, which is "among the earliest dated records of ancient India, and proves that Rudradaman was reigning in AD 150" (Basham 1999:62), records the repair of a lake called Sudarsana, which had burst under the impact of a violent storm. It is dated in the year 72, thus indicating a sense of chronology, although no era is specified. It is usually taken to represent the Saka era, which places it c. 150 AD. Then the history of the construction of the dam is mentioned: as originally constructed under the orders of Vaisya Pusyagupta, who was the provincial governor of the region in which the dam is located, namely Saurastra, in the time of Candragupta Maurya. These names are stated as such in the epigraph and are not being inferred. It is then recorded that the facilities were upgraded and the conduits for irrigation provided by Yuvanaraja Tushaspha, the governor of the same province during the time of AMoka. Thus the succession of the kings of the Mauryan dynasty is correctly stated. The ancestry of Rudradaman himself is specified with such precision that it has helped resolve debates: it is stated that the inscription was incised "In the 52nd year, in reign of Rudradaman, son of Jayadaman, grandson of Chashtana and great-grandson of Ysamotika" (Raychaudhuri 1999:431). It goes on to say that in Rudradaman's time it was seriously damaged by a storm and repaired again by Rudradaman's orders. Apart from these details, several other aspects of the inscription demand attention for the historical sense implicit in them. The inscription describes Rudradaman as resorted to by all the "castes" and chosen as their lord to protect them (sarva-varna-abhigamya-raksanarthath patitve vrtena) (Banerjea 1957:282). This has been regarded as historical evidence of the election of a king in ancient India, along with that of the election of Gopala, the founder of Pala Dynasty in Bengal in the eighth century (Kane 1968-77, 3:30). Another interesting aspect is provided by the claim that Rudra- daman was "the restorer of kings who had been deprived of their kingdoms" (bhrasta-rdnja-pratisthapaka) (Banerjea 1957:282; Ray- chaudhuri 1999:752). The inscription refers to Rudradaman defeating Satakarni, Lord of the Deccan (daksinapatha-pati) twice. The exact</page><page sequence="6">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 195 identity of the kind remains uncertain - he has been variously identi- fied by Rapson and B.N. Mukherjee with Vasisthiputra Sri Satakarni, by D.R. Bhandarkar with Gautamiputra Satakarni himself and by K. Gopalachari with Siva Sri Satakarni (Banerjea 1957:282). The cru- cial point is that apparently the king was reinstated in the regions thus regained by defeating the Satavahanas. This resonates with three kinds of conquests specified in the Arthasistra: "The first is conquest in which the defeated king is forced to render homage and tribute, af- ter which he, or a member of the family is reinstated as a vassal. The second is victory in which enormous booty is demanded and large por- tions of enemy territory annexed. The third involves the political anni- hilation of the conquered kingdom and its incorporation in that of the victor" (Basham 1999:124). The Sanskrit terms for these are dharmavijaya, lobhavijaya and asuravijaya respectively. Apparently Rudradaman was following the dharmavijaya model but with a wrinkle. Since areas lost to the Satavahanas were being recovered, this was more like reconquest or punarvijaya: dharmapunarvijaya. History is here grabbing at the coattails of political theory. Such a policy is recommended by Kautilya (vii. 161) in the Arthasistra, as well as by Yajfiavalkya (i.342-343) - in a text of dharnasastra. The epigraphic confirmation it receives here and partially later, indicates a general awareness of its historicity perhaps as much as its sagacity. From the point of view of the historical sense (as distinguished from the political) of the ancient Indians, it is worth noting that this epigraphic information about Rudradaman's conquest is confirmed by an extra-Indic literary source. In the Geography of Ptolemy, written about AD 140 with materials gathered a few years earlier, Ozene, i.e. Ujjayani, capital of Avanti (west Malwa), is men- tioned as the headquarters of Tiastenes, undoubtedly a Greek corruption of the name Chashtana. In the Junagarh inscription of Rudradaman, that ruler is repre- sented as the lord of many countries including Akara, Avanti, Anipa, Aparanta, Saurashtra and Anarta (Dvaraka region in Saurashtra), which had all been con- quered from Gautamiputra (c. AD 106-30), probably when Rudradaman was a Kshatrapa under his grandfather. Rudradaman further claims to have twice de- feated Satakarni, lord of Dakshinipatha, whom he did not destroy, as he was a near relative. This Satakarni seems to be no other than Gautamiputra. The close-</page><page sequence="7">196 Arvind Sharma ness of relation between the two rulers is explained by the Kanheri inscription which refers to a Kardamaka princess as the daughter of Mahakshatrapa Ru(dra) who is generally identified with Rudradaman, and as the wife of Vasisthiputra Satakarmi, apparently a co-uterine brother of Vasisthiputra Pulumavi and a son of Gautamiputra. Rudradaman's claim to have reinstated deposed kings may have reference to the reinstatement of certain feudatories of Nahapana, ousted by Gau- tamiputra Satakarni. (Sircar 1968:183) In the same inscription, Rudradaman speaks of defeating the Yaud- heyas: "Loath to submit rendered proud as they were of having mani- fested their titles of heroes among all Ksatriyas" (Banerjea 1957:282; Sanskrit text Kane 1968-77, 3:89). A.L. Basham notes (1999:97-98): The Mahdbhdrata takes full cognisance of the existence of republican tribes in Western India, and their survival until the 5th century AD is attested by numerous coins and a few short inscriptions. Perhaps the most important western republic was that of the Yaudheyas in Northern Rajasthan, which issued numerous coins, bearing the inscription "Victory to the Yaudheya tribe"; one of their official seals has been found, with the proud legend, "Of the Yaudheyas, who possess the magic spell of victory"; and one fragmentary Yaudheya inscription survives. This mentions the chief of the tribe, whose name has unfortunately been worn away by the weathering stone; he has the regal title of maharaja, but he is also called mahilsenapati, or general-in-chief, and he is "placed at the head of the Yaudheya people." There is a widespread impression that monarchy of the hereditary type was the main form of government in ancient India. The Junagadh inscription indicates that this common view may be in need of revision in more ways than one. Here we have an elected king celebrating his martial success against a republican martial tribe! It may make much more sense to consider the texture of ancient Indian polity as weaving the strands of monarchy and republicanism, and sometimes in surprising ways, than thinking of it as characterized by a seamless personal despotism. The Inscription also sheds interesting light on administrative arrange- ments in ancient India in at least three ways. One should note that Asoka's governor in this region was a Yavanardja. This means that "foreigners" could find gainful employment in the Indian system of government, as the name Yavanaraja Tushashpa "is of Iranian origin"</page><page sequence="8">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 197 (Raychaudhuri 1999:601, 617). The Junadagh Inscription confirms this while describing the way repairs were carried out in Rudradaman's time: Shortly before AD 150-51, a terrible cyclone caused a serious breach, as a result of which Sudariana lake ceased to exist. When the peasants were fearing failure of the annual crops, Rudradaman sent his councillors and executive officers for the repair of the dam and the reconstruction of the lake. All the officials having been unsuccessful in the task, Pahlava Suvidakha, son of Kulaipa, was appointed governor of Anarta and Surashtra. The efforts of this Parthian official in the employment of Rudradaman were crowned with success, and the reservoir was again brought into being. (Sircar 1968:184) It also adds to our understanding of ancient Indian administra- tion by drawing a distinction between "deliberative officials (mati- saciva or dhTsaciva) and executive officials (karmasaciva). The former were councillors, while the latter approximately corresponded to high ranking civil servants of modern times" (Basham 1999:100; Scharfe 1989:152). But it is the third aspect which is the most striking as it of- fers an insight into the working of the king's council - a reference one finds lodged in the middle of the following comment by A.L. Basham: In fact the council often exerted great powers. It might transact business in the king's absence, and the AMokan inscriptions show that it might make minor decisions without consulting him. The Saka satrap Rudradaman referred the question of rebuilding the Girnar dam to his councillors, who advised against it, so that he was forced to undertake the work against their advice, apparently at the expense of the privy purse and not of public funds. The Kashmir Chronicle gives one case of a privy council deposing the king, and another of its vetoing the king's nomination of his successor. (Basham 1999:99) The date of the Junagadh inscription is also of interest from another point of view. The cyclical cosmology of the yugas is regularly associated with Hinduism and sometimes adduced as evidence that the Hindus did not develop the concept of linear history. The time when this cyclical concept3 came into vogue is far from certain, although it seems to be firmly in place by around 400 AD. The Junagadh 3 The cycle is repeated but not replicated, see Thomas 1997:83-89.</page><page sequence="9">198 Arvind Sharma inscription seems to indicate a transitional phase in its growth. It contains echoes the cataclysmic close of a yuga in the expression: yuga-nidhana-sadria-parama-ghora-vegena (Kane 1968-77, 3:890). Some points made pertaining to Rudradaman in the Junagadh Inscription await clarification. He is said "to have enjoyed royal fortune even when he was in his mother's womb. The exact significance of the claim, however, cannot be determined in the present state of our knowledge" (Sircar 1968:185). We referred earlier to the different views regarding the identity of the Satakarni king twice defeated but due to "nearness of connection" (sambandhaviduratd) Rudradaman did not destroy him. B.N. Mukherjee favours his identification with Va-isthiputra, as opposed to the one made with Gautamiputra by D.C. Sircar earlier, when he writes (Raychaudhuri 1999:745): This Satakarni can be identified with Vadisthiputra Satakarni whose queen is referred to in an inscription at Kanheri as belonging to the family of the Karddamaka kings and as the daughter of Makakshatrapa Rudra (Rudradaman I). The legend of a coin-type (lion: bow and tree) attributes the title of Makakshatrapa to Va~isthiputra. We do not know whether he controlled, at least for some time, the existing Satavahana territory, and especially north-western Deccan (already annexed by Rudradaman) as a subordinate ruler. His Nanaghat inscription of the regnal year 13 describes him as Chatarapana (Khatarapana = Kshatrapanam, i.e. "of the Kshatrapa family"?). Two other points of a slightly different nature but of comparatively broader interest may also be examined. One of them consists of Rudradaman's claim that he won the title of mahaksatrapa for himself (svayamadhigata-mahaksatrapa-nama). Two converging reasons have been proposed by way of explanation: it might mean that he did not inherit the title from his father, and that this royal house might have faced a serious crisis which he weathered, thereby feeling entitled to call himself mahaksatrapa (Gopalachari 1957:282).4 The precise explanation eludes us at the moment.5 4 Does the case of Skandagupta of the Gupta dynasty provide a partial parallel here? See Tripathi 1967:260. 5 The claim could also contain a conventional element, see Sircar 1971a:8.</page><page sequence="10">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 199 A more intriguing issue is raised by the question of the degree of his commitment to the varna order, or the "caste system" indicated in the inscription. Ram Sharam Sharma identifies Rudradaman as a "sup- porter of the varna society" (R.S. Sharma 1980:241), on the basis of the inscription, and elsewhere brings him closer to Manu on this point when he writes: "In the second century inscriptions of Gautamiputra Satakarni and Rudradaman emphasize the preservation of varnas as one of the main royal functions. This aspect is also stressed by Manu, who is keen on avoiding varnasarnkara" (R.S. Sharma 1980:330). This enables one to introduce a point which will be elaborated later, as to the extent to which such descriptions are historical or conventional, for in many ways the tenor of the Junagadh Inscription is different from that of Manu. In fact, according to Manu, Rudradaman would probably qualify as a "fallen ksatriya" (x.44) on account of his "caste." It should not be overlooked however that in medieval times even the Buddhist Pala dynastic rulers claimed to have prevented varnasankara.6 Finally, the "Girnar inscription of Rudradaman, dated AD 150, is the earliest surviving example of courtly Sanskrit prose" (Basham 1999:415). This should serve both as an observation and as a warning. As an observation it helps to locate the inscription in the history of Sanskrit prose, but as such prose has a tendency to become florid, it also serves as a warning to allow for a measure of literary latitude. Thus "when Rudradaman claims on line 15 of the Junagadh inscription to have 'been wreathed with many garlands at the svayamvara of kings' daughters' this, too, should be regarded as poetic hyperbole in an inscription which follows conventional poetical standards" (Scharfe 1989:124 n. 773), similar to the claims made by Bilhana about the Calukya King Vikramaditya VI. The statement that "his good rule ... 6 "The Pala Emperors, who ruled in Bengal and Bihar from the eighth to the twelfth century, claimed to have been staunch followers of the Buddhist faith (parama- saugata). It is, however, interesting to note that, like typically zealous kings avowing the Brahmanical faith, the Palas were eager to suppress the social evil styled varna- sahkara" (Sircar 1971b:187).</page><page sequence="11">200 Arvind Sharma rid his dominions of disease, robbers, wild beasts and other pests" (Sircar 1968:185) may also, at least in part, be conventional, as also the latter parts of his boast "that he filled his treasury by means of bali [tax], sulka [tolls] and bhdga [due share] levied according to the sastras and that his treasury overflowed with heaps of gold, silver, diamonds, lapis lazuli, and other gems" (Kane 1968-77, 3:197). It is worth noting here that "hopeless exaggeration is less noticeable in the description of the Indian rulers of the earlier period of [Indian] history. For this reason, the earlier the king is, the greater is our reliance on his claims, in spite of the obvious fact that there is always a considerable amount of exaggeration in the royal prasastis composed by the court poets of Indian monarchs" (Sircar 1971a:2). The sequel to the repairs performed on Lake Sudariana testifies further to a historical sense on the part of Hindus. We know from the Junagadh Rock Inscription of Skandagupta that "breaches again appeared in the embankment in G.E. 136 = 456 AD and Parnadatta's son, Cakrapalita, who was the governor of Girnar, rebuilt it of solid masonry at an "immeasurable cost." To commemorate the successful completion of the work, a temple of the God Cakrabhrit or Visnu was constructed in G.E. 138 = 458 AD. No traces of the lake or the temple are found now" (Tripathi 1967:262). Significantly, the inscriptions of both Rudradaman and Skandagupta betray familiarity with the technical terms found in the Arthasastra (Kautilya i.8-10; see Raychaudhuri 1999:9). This takes one into the Gupta period and prepares the ground for the discussion of the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta (c. 335-375). The inscription "is unhappily undated, but it is surely not a posthumous document, as supposed by Fleet. It must have been engraved about 360 AD - after the completion of Samudragupta's 'digvijaya' and before the performance of Asvamedha which is not mentioned in it" (Tripathi 1967:241; also see Ram 1980:131-133). As the main focus of the present disquisition is an assessment of the historical sense of the Hindus, and the light that epigraphic evidence might shed on the issue, the location of the inscription is worth noting in itself. Rama Shankar Tripathi notes that "with his ideal of war</page><page sequence="12">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 201 and aggrandizement, Samudragupta is the very antithesis of AMoka, who stood for peace and piety. The former's achievements formed the subject of an elaborate panegyric by the court poet Harisena, and, strangely enough, Samudragupta chose to leave a permanent record of his sanguinary conquests by the side of the ethical exhortations of AMoka on one of his pillars, now inside the fort of Allahabad" (Tripathi 1967:241). If this was a deliberate decision on the part of Samudragupta then it tells us a lot about the sense of history of the Hindus. Asoka and Samudragupta are thus comparable not only historically but also epigraphically: "we possess a long eulogy of this king (Samu- dragupta) by one of his officials named Harishena and engraved on the Asoka pillar of Allahabad. This eulogy or prasasti gives a detailed ac- count of the career and personality of Samudragupta, such as we do not possess of any other king of ancient India, except the great Maurya Emperor AMoka" (Majumdar 1970:7).7 The contents of the inscription, which seem to follow a geographical rather than a chronological order, provide a clear picture of the pattern of Samudragupta's military and political prowess. The pattern consists of four categories. First comes a list of nine kings who were "vio- lently exterminated." One recalls here the designation of Mahapadma Nanda as sarvaksatrantaka, or destroyer of all the ksatriyas, compara- ble to Samudragupta's claim of being sarvarnjocchetta (uprooter of all 7 Hemchandra Raychaudhuri also compares him to A"oka: "Samudra Gupta favoured poetry as well as the stistras, while ASoka seems to have specialized in scriptural studies alone. The former undertook military campaigns with the object of sarva-prithivT-jaya, conquest of the whole earth, as known to his panegyrist, the latter eschewed military conquest after the Kalifiga war and organized missions to effect Dhamma-vijaya, conquest of the hearts of men, in three continents. Yet in spite of these differences there was much that was common to these remarkable men. Both laid stress on parakrama, ceaseless exertion in the cause in which they believed. Both expressed solicitude for the people committed to their care, and were kind even to vanquished enemies. And both laid emphasis on Dharma. Samudragupta no less than Dharma~oka, made firm the rampart of the true law (Dharma-prachTra-bandhah)" (1999:485-486).</page><page sequence="13">202 Arvind Sharma kings) in Aryavarta (Raychaudhuri 1999:471). These nine monarchs were the following: Rudradeva, Matila, Ndgadatta, Candra-varman, Ganapatinaga, Nagasena, Nandin, Acyuta and Balavarman.8 In rela- tion to these kings Samudragupta followed the policy of asuravijaya, a name which, according to Hemachandra Raychaudhuri "may have been derived from the Assyrians, the ruthlessness of whose warfare is well known" (Raychaudhuri 1999:474, n. 1). This view is strength- ened by the fact that Kautilya "claims to have studied the practices pre- vailing in contemporary states" (ii. 10) (R.S. Sharma 1980:160; Kangle 1988, 3:74) and although he is not contemporaneous with the Assyri- ans, his location at Taxila and involvement in national and (as a result of Macedonian incursion) international politics renders the idea less far-fetched than it might appear otherwise. Within this larger category also fall the states with the status of tributaries. If we now consider the position of the tributary states on the frontiers of Samudra-gupta's dominions, we may form an idea of the territory directly under the administration of Samudra-gupta. In the east it included the whole of Bengal, excepting its south-eastern extremity. Its northern boundary ran along the foothills of the Himalayas. In the west it extended up to the territory of the Madras in the Punjab and probably included its eastern districts between Lahore and Karnml. From Karnal the boundary followed the Yamuna up to its junction with the Chambal, and thence along an imaginary line drawn almost due south to Bhilsa. The southern boundary ran from Bhilsa to Jubbulpore and thence along the Vindhya range of hills. Samudra-gupta is said to have conquered all the Atavi- rajyas (forest kingdoms) which probably denoted the hilly tracts, full of dense forest, extending eastwards from Jubbulpore. (Majumdar 1970:9) The claim to the subjugation of forest kingdoms (dtavika-rdjya) of Dabhala or the Jabalpur territory is confirmed by another in- scription of Samudragupta, that at Eran. Similarly, the defeat of Nagasena, one of the nine uprooted kings, is confirmed by a pas- sage in Bana's Harsacarita which speaks of Nagasena, born in the Naga-family, whose confidential deliberations were divulged by a 8 Although "the dominions of ... five kings, viz. Rudradeva, Matila, Nigadatta, Nandin, and Balavarman cannot be located at present, we can form an idea of the territory thus conquered.. ."

The second category includes rulers towards whom he followed a policy of dharmavijaya, or subjugation and reinstatement. He adopted this policy during his campaign in peninsular India in the course of which he subdued twelve kings: Mahendra, Vydghraraja, Mantaraja, Mahendra, Svamidatta, Damana, Visnugupta, Nilaraja, Hastivarman, Ugrasena, Kubera and Dhanaiijaya (Tripathi 1967:242-243). The ge- ographical location of each king is specified and suggests a march down the eastern coast to the Chera kingdom and return-march by way of Maharastra and Khandesh, although four of these: "Mantaraja of Kaurala, Svamidatta of Kottfira, Nilaraja of Avamukta and Dhanafi- jaya of Kusthalapura cannot be identified with certainty" (Majumdar 1970:10). A third category consists of tribes and frontier kings who submitted to the might of Samudragupta and gratified his imperial commands by "paying all kinds of taxes, obeying his orders and coming to pay homage" (Majumdar 1970:10). Nine tribes9 and five frontier stateslo are listed in the inscription. These nine tribes can be divided into groups of two, one group comprising the Malavas, Yaudheyas, Madrakas and Arjunayanas, which seen to lie towards the west, and another comprising the Sanakinikas, Abhiras, Prarjunas, Kakas and Kharaparakas, which seems to lie in Central India, the identification of the last three being less certain than of the first two. Of the five frontier kingdoms: Samatata, Kamartipa, Nepala, Davaka and Kartrpura, the first three are well known, and the last two have been identified more tentatively with Nowgong district of Assam and Kartarpur in Jalandhar district. It is worth noting that these "five tributary kingdoms are expressly stated to be situated on the frontiers of Samudragupta's 9 Malavas, Arjunayana, Yaudheya, Madraka, Abhira, Prarjuna, Sanakanika, Kaka and Kharaparikas (Tripathi 1967:244-245). 10 Samatata (South-Eastern Bengal); DIavaka (Dacca); Kamaru5pa (Assam); Nepal and Kartrpura (Tripathi 1967:244).</page><page sequence="15">204 Arvind Sharma dominions. The feudatory tribal states mentioned with them were also presumably on the frontier" (Majumdar 1970:8). The fourth category consisted of foreign potentates who symboli- cally recognised his sovereignty. These included Sri Lafika, and areas where Kusanas and Sakas held sway. They sought to "win the favour of the great emperor by personal attendance at his court, offering daugh- ters in marriage, and asking permission for the use of imperial coins or soliciting imperial charters confirming them in the enjoyment of their territories" (ibid.). Although the Allahabad pillar inscription enumerates this pattern of pan-Indian conquest as it were (with the exception of Malwa) it does not state that Samudragupta performed the Asvamedha sacrifice. However, a coin issued by him seems to commemorate it. The gold coin shows "a horse standing before a sacrificial post (yapa) on the obverse, and on the reverse the queen and the legend: AMvamedha- parakramah" (Tripathi 1967:247). Some matters pertaining to the Allahabad pillar inscription do await clarification. As noted earlier, some scholars, following Keilhorn, take it as posthumous in nature (Scharfe 1989:63 n. 293; Tripathi 1967:240) but most scholars think otherwise. The fact that the prasasti does not mention the performance of the AMvamedha supports the latter view. Scharfe (1989:56) points out: "we notice that public rituals were frequent at the beginning of a dynasty, although some have ventured to read evidence of an Advamedha in the inscription" (Raychaudhuri 1999:484). The fact that the inscription does not mention the Vakatakas is more puzzling. As Hemchandra Raychaudhuri notes (1999:477): "It is not a little surprising that the Allahabad Prasasti contains no clear reference to the Vakatakas who are known to have dominated part of the region between Bundelkhand and the Pengafiga in the fifth century AD." Some explanations have been offered (Raychaudhuri 1999:478- 479) but the fact nevertheless remains noteworthy. Similarly, the so- called Kacha coins and their relationship to Samudragupta and to the circumstances in which Samudragupta was selected to succeed remain obscure. The epithet sarva-rajocchetta is found on the coins,</page><page sequence="16">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 205 and coincides with Samudragupta's description in the inscription. Hemachandra Raychaudhuri is therefore disposed to identify the two. It is clear from the Allahabad pillar inscription that Samudragupta was selected to succeed to the throne in a "tense atmosphere" (Majumdar 1970:7). A special case was the appointment of Samudragupta as successor by his father Candragupta I. As son of the heiress to the Licchavi kingdom, i.e. as the dauhitra of the Licchavi king, Samudragupta was entitled to succeed his maternal grandfather as soon as he came of age. Candragupta's second son would have claims to eventually succeed his father as king of the original Gupta kingdom. But "under the glances of the withered face(s) of his relative(s) of equal birth ... [Samudragupta] was told by his father: 'Rule the whole earth!' " (Scharfe 1989:64) It has been speculated that among the withered glances may have been those of "Kacha ... the eldest brother of Samudragupta [who] headed the rebellion against him" (Majumdar 1970:7). This is far from certain. The selection of Samudragupta, however, is hinted at in another piece of epigraphic evidence, the Riddhapur Inscription, in the epithet tatpadaparigrhtta (Raychaudhuri 1999:470). The martial achievements of Samudragupta imply a navy, although no direct reference to it is made in the inscription. "Although there is no proof of this, we know that many islands in the Indian Ocean were either conquered by the great Gupta monarch or submitted to him out of fear, thus clearly indicating his possession of a powerful navy" (Majumdar 1964:231). John Keay even proposes that "other islands" could mean "the Indianised kingdoms of south-east Asia" (Keay 2000:137). Hemchandra Raychaudhuri reads indirect indications of a naval presence in the epigraph itself (1999:482 n. 9). It is thus a major argument of this paper that if one is looking for evidence to judge the presence or absence of a historical sense among the Hindus, then the place to look for it are the epigraphic records left by the rulers. The fact that such epigraphs are found in large numbers seems to quantitatively testify to such a sense, and a critical examination of two famous inscriptions seems to confirm the same fact qualitatively. It only needs to be added that what was true</page><page sequence="17">206 Arvind Sharma of the north was also true of the south, as illustrated by the case of the Colas in medieval times. "The exploits of both Rajaraja and his equally aggressive son" Rajendra -covering a period from 985 AD to 1035 AD -"are celebrated in numerous inscriptions beginning from the eighth year of Rdjaraja, whose earliest conquest was that of the Chera Kingdom" (Spear 1999:224). II A problem associated with the acceptance of a historical sense on the part of the Hindus is their allegedly exaggerated sense of the past, which inclines one to say that they might possess a sense of antiquity but not history (Basham 1999:4, 44). There is some substance to this charge as the Hindu scheme of yugas and kalpas involves mind- boggling figures. There is, however, enough evidence now to indicate that both outsiders and insiders to the Hindu tradition were aware of a distinction between remote antiquity and proximate history, and moreover that rational explanation of at least part of the tendency towards chronological exaggeration may be available. The first major foreign source for Hindu chronology is Megasthenes (McCrindle 1960:115-116). The restrained nature of the figures mentioned by him led the translator to remark: "It is not known from what sources Megasthenes derived these figures, which are extremely modest when compared with those of Indian chronology, where, as in geology, years are hardly reckoned but in myriads" (ibid. 208). More than a thousand years later, Albirini remarks that "the Hindus do not consider it wearisome to reckon with huge numbers, but rather enjoy it" (Sachau 1914, 2:1), but nevertheless proceeds to point out that those eras which "vie with each other in antiquity" (ibid.), are such "as not only astronomers, but also other people, think it wearisome and unpractical to use them" (2:42). He notes that in their place they employ other eras, what we might call eras of history, associated with Sri Harsa, Vikrama-ditya, Saka, Valabha and Gupta (ibid.). Even more to the point is Michael Witzel's explanation of how errors tend to creep into the use of eras: because of a cultural commitment, as it were, to reach back to</page><page sequence="18">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 207 the beginning of the Kali Yuga, for "the concept of Kali Yuga, as the period we live in, plays a great role that has not been appreciated in the evaluation of chronicles such as varnitavalts" (Witzel 1990:28-29). The slippage from history to antiquity is thus not a mere flight of fancy, but the consequence (or cause) of systematic errors, such as counting contemporary dynasties as successive, etc. (ibid.). It was noted earlier that the ancient Indian inscriptions tend to be dated (if at all) in the regnal year of the kings, or often in an era which is not specified. This was the case with the inscription of Rudrada-man discussed earlier and seems to encourage the belief that the Hindus lacked a sense of history and chronology. A.L. Basham writes (1999:493): Until the 1st century BC there is no good evidence that India had any regular system of recording the year of an event by dating in a definite era like the A.U.C. of Rome or the Christian era of medieval and modern Europe. Early inscriptions are dated if at all in the regnal year of the ruling king. The idea of dating over a long period of time from a fixed year was almost certainly introduced into India by the invaders of the Northwest, who have left the earliest inscriptions thus dated in India. Unfortunately the Indians did not adopt a uniform era, and a number of systems of dating were in use from that time onwards... This passage creates the further impression that reckoning from a fixed point was introduced in India by foreigners. All this, however, must be viewed in the light of another set of facts. For instance, "the traditional date of Mahavira's death is fixed near the end of the rainy season in 527 BC; it is from this date that Jainas count the Viranirvana period, the longest continuous 'era' in Indian history" (Jaini 1979:37-38, emphasis supplied). Thus it is simply not true that Indians lacked any reckoning in a fixed era. The remark holds true only of the epigraphic evidence so far available, and should not be transferred uncritically to the Hindu or Indic mentality. Another point in relation to this era deserves mention. "One Jaina source (Hemacandra's Pariiistaparva viii.341) places this event in 427 BC" (ibid. 38 n. 88). If this amendment is accepted, then the chronology calculated on this basis purely from Indian sources almost coincides with the current chronology of ancient India evolved by Western</page><page sequence="19">208 Arvind Sharma scholarship over the past two hundred years (Sastri and Srinivasachari 1971:65). The Parinirvana of the Buddha could also provide another fixed point, although in this case also, as in the case of the Viranirvana, there is even greater debate as to the exact point (Ch'en 1968:13-15; Majumdar 1968:38, 92-94). But even when there is a difference as to where the point is to be fixed exactly, it does not compromise the claim that calculation from a fixed point was in use, with the attendant sense of history involved. What is true is that evidence of this kind from Hindu sources is not (yet?) available. (The fact that Hinduism does not have a historical founder may be a factor.) As further evidence of historical sense in general one may add that "according to the unanimous tradition of the Buddhists, the Buddha died in the 8th year of the reign of Ajatasatru" (ibid. 36). In any case, the very fact that Hindu or ancient Indian kings employ a number of eras also testifies to their sense of history, although this fact complicates our chronological computations." The example of the Harsa Era should suffice. Dr. Devahuti lists two inscriptions of Harsa and seven others as generally believed to be dated " A.L. Basham (1999:493-494) lists (1) Era of the Kaliyuga (3102 BC); (2) Sri Lankan Buddha Era (544 BC); (3) Era of Mahavira (528 BC); (4) Vikrama Era (58 BC); (5) Saka Era (78 AD); (6) Licchavi Era (110 AD); (7) Kalaciiri Era (248 AD); (8) Gupta Era (320 AD); (9) Harsa Era (606 AD); (10) Kollam Era of Malabar (825 AD); (11) Nevar Era (878 AD); (12) Era of Vikramaditya VI Calukya (1075 AD); and (13) Laksmana Era of Bengal (1119 AD). A.L. Basham also mentions the saptarsi, or Laukika Era of Kashmir, as belonging to the Middle Ages but does not specify the initial year. Albirnini lists the following Eras: (1) the beginning of the existence of the day of the present Nychthemeron of Brahman, i.e., the beginning of the Kalpa; (2) the Manvantara, in which we are now; (3) the beginning of the twenty-eighth Caturyuga, in which we are now; (4) the beginning of the fourth Yuga of the present Caturyuga; (5) Pandava-Kala, i.e. the time of the life and the wars of Bharata; (6) Sri Harsa Era; (7) Vikramaditya Era; (8) Saka Era; (9) Valabha Era; (10) Gupta Era; (11) Era of the canon Khanda-Khadyaka; (12) Era of the canon of Paicasiddhantika of Varahamihira; (13) Era of the canon of Karanasara; and (14) Era of the canon of Karana-tilaka (Sachau 1914, 2:1ff.). Michael Witzel refers additionally to a Suidraka Sarivat (170 BC) and Manadeva Sadivat (576 AD) (1990:36).</page><page sequence="20">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 209 in the Harsa Era of 606 AD. (Devahuti 1970:235). Albirdini provides an interesting note about this Era. He writes (Sachau 1914, 2:5): ... His [i.e. Sri Harsa's] era is used in Mathura and the country of Kanoj. Between Sri Harsa and Vikramaditya there is an interval of 400 years, as I have been told by the inhabitants of that region. However, in the Kashmirian calendar I have read that Sri Harsa was 664 years later than Vikramaditya. In face of this discrepancy I am in perfect uncertainty... Dr. Devahuti suggests the following resolution of this difficulty (1970: 236): To demonstrate the application of the various eras to a given date, the year 400 of Yazdajird, al-Birfini calculates the commencement of the Harsha era according to the Mathura and Kanauj tradition, which placed Harsha 400 years before Vikramaditya, i.e. in 457 BC. But on the authority of the Kashmir calendar, Harsha being "664 years later than Vikramaditya," the Harsha era should be placed in AD 606-7. We think it was this era, which was prevalent in al-Birfini's time in Mathura and Kanauj. It seems that the inhabitants of the region deliberately misguided the Muslim scholar in order to impress him with the antiquity of the era they used. Al-Birfini, though in possession of the correct information through the Kashmir source, naturally placed greater reliance on local tradition, which seemed more authentic on its face value. It is well known that he misunderstood, similarly, the traditions relating to the Gupta era. His critical pen, however, has preserved for us the valuable information he got from the Kashmir Calendar, that Snri Harsha was "664 [years] later than Vikramaditya." She then proceeds to add (ibid.): The astronomical data provided by the Harsha-charita helps us to determine the date of Harsha's birth in AD 590. All the circumstances of that period support the view that Harsha ascended the throne at an early age after his elder brother was killed in his early youth. The Harsha era, beginning in AD 606, when Harsha would be only 16, is in accordance with this fact. It also resolves a slight discrepancy introduced by Zuanzang's account (ibid. 236-237). Albiriini himself enumerates no less than eleven eras and distin- guishes between a set of six eras which "vie in antiquity" from another set of five (Sachau 1914, 2: 1, 7) in favour of which the former ones had been abandoned. This itself implies a distinction between antiquity</page><page sequence="21">210 Arvind Sharma and history. It is therefore mildly surprising that Albirmini castigates the Hindus for lacking a sense of chronology on the one hand and on the other enumerates the many eras they employ. The same sense of history is indicated by the fact that, according to Albirmini, Hindus celebrate a historic victory as a festival, although he is somewhat sceptical about the facts. His account runs as follows (ibid. 2:178): The 2nd of the month Caitra is a festival to the people of Kashmir, called Agdi7s (?), and celebrated on account of a victory gained by their king, Muttai, over the Turks. According to their account he ruled over the whole world. But this is exactly what they say of most of their kings. However, they are incautious enough to assign him to a time not much anterior to our time, which leads to their lie being found out. It is, of course, not impossible that a Hindu should rule (over a huge empire), as Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, and Persians have done, but all the times not much anterior to our own are well known. (If, therefore, such had been the case, we should know it.) Perhaps the here mentioned king ruled over the whole of India, and they know of no other country but India and of no other nations but themselves. There is however some evidence which actually supports this fact if Muttai is read as a reference to King Muktapida of the Karkota dynasty of Kashmir, who is said to have defeated the Turks in the eighth century thrice (A. Sharma 1982:131-136). We may now revert to the discussion of the point that different cultures may have different ways of expressing their sense of history, and this may also be reflected in their choice of the medium for doing so. Stone and not parchment seems to have been the medium of choice in ancient India. Even in the case of documents, however, the sense of history finds its niche in slightly unusual places, such as the colophons of manuscripts. The question of manuscripts, however, raises the important issue of their survival, a problem less acute in the case of inscriptions. It might be possible, with only slight exaggeration, to maintain the thesis that historical records in the broadest sense may have abounded but have simply perished for climatic reasons, combined with political factors. Michael Witzel writes (1990:9): A little used source of history have been the colophons of manuscripts which often mention the name of the reigning monarch and other historically interesting</page><page sequence="22">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 211 details. This is due to the fact that in India proper most mss. are only of relative late date. Except for the desert areas of Gujarat/Rajasthan, mss. have not survived much more than 500 years, and Hindus in general did not care much for their preservation as only the living, recited work, in the mouth of the teacher, poet or priest was important. Fortunately, the Jainas and Buddhists preserved their texts as far as the early ninth century AD (in dated form), and a few older undated ones, so much so that when Bendall first made use of their colophons for historical purposes at the Berlin congress about a hundred years ago, he was simply not believed at first. In Nepal the temperate climate and the almost complete absence of Muslim incursions worked together to preserve these old mss. Such ms. colophons, which also contain much of other valuable and so far unused information, such as on local personal and geographical names, religious trends, etc., should be used for the elucidation of the "dark spots" in the history of particular local areas and their political history, say, for parts of Orissa, Kerala, and Gujarat. This conclusion is significant as indicative of the kind of evidence of a sense of history now lost to us. There is evidence that detailed administrative records were kept in Mauryan times. The office of the aksapatala, or depository of documents, as detailed in the Arthasdistra (2.7.1) provides such convincing evidence of this12 that Hartmut Scharfe is led to remark (1989:139): In view of the careful bookkeeping in the aksa-patala the virtual absence of archives and chronicles in India is surprising; but the climate would destroy most documents. The frequent change of administrative centres as a result of the rise of new dynasties with a strictly regional power base further prevented the developmental of an archival tradition. 12 "An office of very great importance, situated in the capital, is the aksapatala. It is a sort of records-cum-audit office. There is an adhyaksa in charge, with a special building of his own with many halls and record rooms (2.7.1). The records to be maintained there pertain to (1) the activity of each state department, (2) the working of state factories and conditions governing production in them, (3) prices, samples and standards of measuring instruments for various kinds of goods, (4) laws, transactions, customs, and regulations in force in different regions, villages, castes, families and corporations, (5) salaries and other perquisites of state servants, (6) what is made over to the king and other members of the royal family, and (7) payments made to and amounts received from foreign princes, whether allies or foe (2.7.2). A more comprehensive record-house can hardly be thought of" (Kangle 1988, 3:201).</page><page sequence="23">212 Arvind Sharma There is, however, enough evidence of the presence of such a tradi- tion (Kane 1968-77, 3:308-312). It is even proven by the Manusmrti (x.55; ix.332; viii.255) which is usually placed between the Mau- ryan and the Guptan Period (Agrawala 1970:50). The Allahabad pil- lar inscription depicts suppliant kings seeking confirmation through royal decrees (Tripathi 1967:246). Once again no trace of them is left. Zuanzang clearly refers to records kept at the provincial level (Beal 1969:78), which also are no longer available.13 An extreme case of the conspiracy of negative forces in relation to the manuscript tradi- tion is provided by Kashmir, where "no mss. older than c. 1500 AD remain. Local Hindu and Muslim chroniclers agree in blaming the Sul- tans Sikander and Ali (1389-1419/20) for their wholesale destruction by burning and dumping them in the Dal Lake" (Witzel 1990:44 n. 35). One may now turn one's attention to such literary evidence which might have a bearing on the historical sense of the Hindus as has survived. This would include the Vedas, the Puranas, the tradition of historical kavyas in Sanskrit and literature in general. The problem with the evidence provided by the Vedas is that it has been constantly reworked. "How this reworking took place can be closely studied if we compare the RgVedic form of such a popular tale as that of Puriravas and Urva'i (RV 10.95), with its form in Satapatha Brahmana 11.5.1 or the Baudhayana Srauta Stitra 18.44, in the Mahabharata 1.70 and in Kalidasa's Kavya" (Witzel 1990:8). So what we have here are materials for the cultural history of Hinduism 13 The care which apparently went into the preparation of some of these documents makes their loss all the more painful. A.L. Basham writes (1999:100): "To transmit the royal decrees a corps of secretaries and clerks was maintained, and remarkable precautions were taken to prevent error. Under the C61as, for instance, orders were first written by scribes at the king's dictation, and the accuracy of the drafts was attested by competent witnesses. Before being sent to their recipients they were carefully transcribed, and a number of witnesses, sometimes amounting to as many as thirteen, again attested them. In the case of grants of land and privileges an important court official was generally deputed to ensure that the royal decrees were put into effect. Thus records were kept with great care, and nothing was left to chance; the royal scribes themselves were often important personages."</page><page sequence="24">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 213 rather than history itself. This has the unfortunate consequence that the "ancient historical tradition of India, as found in the Mahabhdrata and the Puranas, thus is flawed from the beginning: it is not history but the bardic reworking of the old epic tradition, often based on Vedic tradition itself" (ibid.). However, while itself not history it has provided enough material for the writing of one, at least at the hands of H.C. Raychaudhuri, the full title of whose benchmark book is revealing: Political History of Ancient India from the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of the Gupta Dynasty. What is significant in the Purana, however, is the "idea of geneal- ogy," which in this particular case may be beyond recovery, but which provided the model for the writing up of genealogies in later more his- torical times. That these royal genealogies can be of historical value has been demonstrated painstakingly by Michael Witzel's work on the Gopdlarajavamsya-vali of Nepal. It was discovered a hundred years ago by Bendall and initially even aroused some scepticism. Its text consists of two parts. The first part is in Sanskrit, which, after presenting a legendary account of early kings offers a detailed account of King Sivadeva (Nepala Samivat 219 = 1098 AD) and towards the end records a description of an Islamic incursion into the valley under Sams ud-Din in November 1349, and the victory of King Jayasthiti Malla c. 1389 ad, after which it trails off (Witzel 1990:12). The second part covers the period from Nepala Sarhvat 177 (= 1057 AD)- the year of birth of King Sivadeva - to Nepala Sariivat 508 (= 1388), that is, until a few years before the death of King Jayasthiti Malla. It is also initially in Sanskrit but with occasional entries in old Newdri; the account from 1219 AD being entirely in old Newdri (ibid.). The significance of such works becomes apparent when one realizes that "the core of historical tradition in India was the genealogical records. These have remained constant in the Indian scene throughout the centuries and in fact up to the present day" (Thapar 1978:278) including subaltern India (Dube 1998:219). It should therefore not come as a surprise that the Gopalardjavam dvalT is "certainly not the only text of its sort. There are more ... perhaps many more than we might expect. The vamsyvalis from Himachal Pradesh are comparatively well known due</page><page sequence="25">214 Arvind Sharma to Atkinson's work. They cover the Katyuris of Kangra, the Chands of Kumaon (c. 1150 AD) and the Panwars of Garwal. In Rajasthan, there are a large number of vams'valls dealing both with the royal houses as well as some high caste persons. In this region they are maintained by special classes of people" (Witzel 1990:37). As is known, in "the Puranas the genealogies are carefully preserved and follow an historical order" (Thapar 1978:278) and F.E. Pargiter (1922) famously tried to reconstruct the history of pre-Buddhist India from these. What is interesting here is that while the "stress on local dynastic history and the size of the area involved"14 may "have prevented the 'composition of a universal' history of South Asia ... even this is not altogether absent. It has been attempted in the Puranas, interestingly again in the Brahmanical guise of dynastic history, through the linking of all royal families of the subcontinent with their mythical ancestors, Manu and his sons" (Witzel 1990:40-41). The historical narratives constitute a class of classical Sanskrit liter- ature. To this class belong such works as: (1) the Navasahasarikacarita of Parimala Padmagupta (c. 1005); (2) the Vikramankadevacarita of Bilhana (11th century); (3) the Rajatarahigint of Kalhana (c. 1148-9); (4) the Prthvirajavijaya of Jayanaka (c. 1192); (5) the Dvydsiraya- mahaikdvya of Hemacandra Suiri (12th century); (6) the Ramacarita of Sandhyakara (12th century); (7) the KTrtikaumudT of Somesvaradeva (13th century); (8) the SukrtasamkTrtana of Arisiriaha (c. 1229); (9) the Vasantavildsa of Balacandra Suri (c. 1200); (10) the HammTrama- hakavya of Nayacandra Suiri (15th century); (11) the Madhurdvijaya of Gangadevi (c. 1371); (12) the Saluvabhyudaya of Rdjanatha Dindima (c. 1480) (Prabha 1976). To these one must add the famous prose romance of Bana-the Harsacarita which belongs to the seventh century and the Gaudavaho of V~kpatiraja in Prakrit, which belongs to the eighth century. These works suffer from certain limitations such as the use of poetic con- ceit and their obviously panegyrical character but they do serve to draw attention to the fact that "there are more historical texts than 14 For a useful summary account see Majumdar 1964:68-73.</page><page sequence="26">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 215 the legendary Puranas" (Witzel 1990:5), and that these "have been very little used so far" (ibid. 38) as source material for sober his- tory. Their significance is obvious when one considers the fact that Ramacarita of Sandhydkara "can be read as applying either to the leg- endary Rama of Ayodhya or to the historical king Ramapala of Bengal, who was the poet's contemporary and patron" (Basham 1999:424). That such a work should be written under the aegis of the Buddhist Pala dynasty offers comment on the state of Hindu-Buddhist relations in medieval India. The fact that the court ladies of the Vijayanagara Empire wrote such historical epics, as documented by Julie Hiebert (1988), has important cultural implications. But these are neverthe- less self-proclaimed kavyas. Sanskrit literature in general also pro- vides some evidence of a sense of history. For instance, the gram- marian Panini (c. 400 Bc) refers to sixty-four previous grammari- ans (Agrawala 1958:283); and the etymologist Yaska (c. fifth cen- tury BC) refers to grammatical, ritualist, euhemerist and ascetic ap- proaches to Vedic exegesis (Agrawala 1958:294). Texts on AyurVeda similarly refer to earlier figures (Carakashinthita 1.7-14 mention- ing over fifty). Although Bharata's Niatyasastra (anachronistically) lists a hundred experts in dramaturgy (1.26-39), the Arthasastra texts (Kautilya 1.15) refer to previous savants in the fields. Even the RgVeda (7.87.4) speaks of earlier and later yugas and Vedic recitation still preserves lost tonal accents in early Sanskrit (Witzel 1990:3).15 The manner in which Patifijali has been assigned to the second century BC is also instructive (Tripathi 1967:185-186). Dramas also provide evidence of historical sense in their own way. Those with historical themes such as the Malvikagnimitra, Mudraraksasa, DevTcandragupta obviously display some sense of history, while a number of me- dieval dramas from Nepal provide considerable historical information (Witzel 1990:38-39). But beyond this it has even been claimed that the Sanskrit poets themselves may have possessed a sense of history. 15 "The authors of astronomical books generally also give the exact date of the day on which they completed their work" (Winternitz 1927:30). Aryabhatta tells us his precise age (Kane 1968-77, 3:895).</page><page sequence="27">216 Arvind Sharma Some have read a covert allusion to the "link of kings beginning [?] with the Samudragupta" in dsamudraksitT-ianam (Raghuvamsa i.5); to the Gupta kings in gopte guptamendriyah (i.55); and anvasya gopta grhinT-sahayah (ii.24); to Kumaragupta in iksucchayanisadinyas tasya gopturganodyari; dkumarakathodghatam Sailigopyo jagur yasah (iii.2) (De 1972:155-156). H.C. Raychaudhuri does not go so far but he does remark (1999:477): The capture and liberation of the southern kings [by Samudragupta] notably the ruler of Kottfira near Mt. Mahendragiri remind us of the following lines of Kalida-sa's Raghuvamriarh: Grihfta-pratimuktasya sa dharma-vijayf nripah Sriyarih Mahendra-nathasya jahara natu medintm "The righteous conqueror (Raghu) took away from the lord of the Mahendra Mountain, who was made captive and then released, his glory but not his terri- tory." III Evidence in support of this new perspective is also encountered in the work of Heinrich von Stietencron -and in a very new form: not in written word but in plastic art. Stietencron began with the same "trite observation," (his own words), that "to the modem viewer, therefore, there appears to be an a-historic and non-political attitude in indigenous Indian art which, true to the alleged spiritual quest for the ultimate unchanging reality, did not bother to preserve in stone the transitory achievements of mortal kings" (Stietencron 1985-86:15- 16). Like Professor Witzel, he eventually arrived at a very different conclusion: that even in artistic representations the Hindus displayed a sense of history. Consider, for instance, the depiction of Siva as GafigSdhara (ibid. 18): ... The myth tells the story of the descent of the celestial river Ganga to the earth in order to make her purifying waters available to mankind, particularly for the purification rituals after death. A mortal, Bhagiratha, after practising austerities for a long time, obtains Gahiga's consent to come down to earth. But in order to save the earth from the danger of bursting under the impact of the cascade of heavenly waters, Lord Siva is requested to receive the celestial river on his mighty head.</page><page sequence="28">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 217 Siva agrees and thus becomes mediator between heaven and earth in one of the important cosmogonic acts, which brings life-giving and sanctifying waters to the human world. It is for this act that he is praised as Gafigddhara, the god "who carries Gafga."... Gafiga has doubts whether Siva will be strong enough to withstand the impact of her fall. Convinced of her own strength she believes that the power of her descent will push Siva down into the nether worlds. But Siva, stretching out one or two locks of his hair like a hammock, receives her with perfect ease and immediately punishes her for her self-conceit; for many years she roams about in the endless labyrinth of his crown of matted hair without finding her way out. And it is only on account of the renewed and powerful austerities of Bhagiratha that Siva finally releases the thoroughly humiliated goddess. So far we are in the realm of myth. To enter in the realm of history we need to recall that ancient Indian history in the south was characterized by rivalry between the Calukya dynasty of Badami and the Pallava dynasty of Tiruchirapalli in the seventh century (Spear 1994:221-222). Stietencron (ibid.) draws our attention to the fact that, The first image of Gafigadhara based on this form of myth was created at Tiruchira-palli in the Pallava country during the reign of king Mahendravarman I (ca. 610-630). This king was in bitter conflict with his neighbour, king Durvinita of the Western Gafiga dynasty, who had broken away from the century-old feu- dal alliance with the Pallavas and joined the camp of their rivals, the Calukyas of Badami. Durvinita attacked the young king Mahendravarman from the North- west, and simultaneously, the Calukya armies invaded Mahendravarman's North- eastern territories in Vefigi. The Pallava kingdom seemed truly in great danger until Mahendravarman achieved a victory over his "foremost enemies" at Pul- laltir, ca. 15 miles north of his capital Kaiici. It is to be added that the Gahga kings were Jains while Mahendravarman, formerly also a Jain, had become a devotee of Siva. It was after this victory that the first Gafigadhara image of the type described above was created in south India. It shows the four-armed Siva, hailed by ce- lestials, standing in leisurely pose with one leg supported by his bull Nandin, as he gracefully stretches out a lock of hair to receive the descending goddess Gafiga who appears comparatively small and insignificant. To any contemporary the message of this image was clear enough. Just as Siva stood in ease against the impact of (the water of the river) Gafiga who, in her self-conceit, had believed she could send him to hell, even so the Saiva king Mahendravarman stood in each against the impact of (the army of) the Gafigas who, in their self-conceit, had be- lieved they could destroy the Pallava king. No image of any other form of Siva</page><page sequence="29">218 Arvind Sharma and no other myth could have served to translate this actual historical situation more effectively into a work of religious art. We can be sure the artists and kings and the educated public were conscious of this message of the Gafigadhara image because it retained its direct allusion to the Ganiga dynasty during the following centuries.... A more dramatic example of the interaction between the political history of art is provided by the famous depiction of Visnu's incarna- tion as the Boar (varahavatara) in the Udayagiri cave. Three interpre- tations of this depiction, inviting the reader to note how they become progressively more historical, in accordance with the assumption of the degree of the sense of history on the part of the Hindus entertained by each scholar, are provided below. One may commence with A.L. Basham's interpretation. He writes (1999:371): Perhaps the most immediately impressive of all Guptan sculptures is the Great Boar, carved in relief at the entrance of a cave at Udayagiri, near Bhilsa. The body of the god Vishnu, who became a mighty boar to rescue the earth from the cosmic ocean, conveys the impression of a great primeval power working for good against the forces of chaos and destruction, and bears a message of hope, strength and assurance. The greatness of the god in comparison with his creation is brought out by the tiny female figure of the personified earth, clinging to his tusk. The deep feeling, which inspired the carving in this figure, makes it perhaps the only theriomorphic image in the world's art, which conveys a truly religious message to modern man. There is virtually no historical element in Basham's artistic appre- ciation of this piece. We turn next to H.C. Raychaudhuri. He writes (1999:165): According to sacred legends Vishnu in the shape of a boar had rescued the earth in the aeon of universal destruction. It is significant that the worship of the Boar Incarnation became widely popular in the Gupta-Chalukya period. The poet Visakhadatta actually identifies the man in whose arms the earth found refuge when harassed by the Mlechchhas, who "shook the yoke of servitude from the neck" of his country, with the Varahttanu (Boar form) of the Self-Existent Being. Powerful emperors both in the north and south recalled the feats of the Great Boar, and the mightiest ruler of a dynasty that kept the Arabs at bay for centuries actually took the title of Adivaraha or the Primeval Boar. The Boar Incarnation</page><page sequence="30">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 219 then symbolized the successful struggle of Indians against the devastating floods issuing from the regions outside their borders that threatened to overwhelm their country and civilization in a common ruin. Stietencron is more willing than either Basham or Raychaudhuri to concede a sense of history to the Hindus, and espies an even more specific historical significance in the depiction under discussion. He writes (Stietencron 1985-86:21): There is special feature in the Var.ha relief of Udayagiri which is repeated nowhere else. The ocean out of which the dominating image of Varaha rises with great strength is represented with meticulous care by its endless waves, and again twice in personified form as a man standing in this ocean with a water-pot in his hands. The two river goddesses Gafiga and Yamuna are seen flowing to- wards him. Later images do not show the ocean at all. But here the ocean (Sanskrit: samu- dra) has a special meaning. A word play takes on plastic form. Just as Varaha issuing from the mighty (ocean) samudra rescued the earth from asura oppres- sion, even so did Candragupta II, issuing from his mighty (father) Samudragupta rescued the earth from asura (i.e. Western Ksatrapa) oppression. The person with the water-pot standing in the ocean has thus a double meaning. He is the ocean in anthropomorphic form, but he is also an image of Candragupta's father Samu- dragupta. The ocean was dropped altogether in later representations, since it could not carry similar connotations with other donors. Heinrich von Stietencron goes on to say (ibid.): Whether the Udayagiri image is an illustration of the poet's words, or whether the poet was in turn inspired by the image, cannot be determined with certainty, nor is it relevant in the present context. That such identification of kings and gods was not simply flattering talk of eager panegyrists, but formed part of a royal ideology of divine kingship and was proclaimed by kings in their own inscriptions is shown, among many other instances, by the Allahabad pillar inscription of Candragupta's father Samudragupta. IV Thus far from lacking a sense of history the Hindus even imparted a plastic dimension to historiography. If this is so then this provides added force to the argument developed by Professor Witzel that</page><page sequence="31">220 Arvind Sharma Hindu historiography suffered serious obscuration during the period of Islamic occupation, as this period also involved the destruction of holy images and temples which were one form of material in which such history was preserved. The numerous internal dynastic evolutions would, of course, prove equally destructive of such evidence along with foreign invasions. It should also be remembered that Hindu learning and the Hindu educational system possessed a marked oral character, a feature also noticed by Megasthenes (Bevan 1922:413). In fact, this has been identified by Professor Kane as one of its weaknesses (1974:347- 349), a weakness which made it particularly vulnerable to historical vicissitudes resulting from foreign conquests. Albirfini's statement that as a result of Mahmud's devastating raids "Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places where our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares, and other places" (Sachau 1914, 1:22) becomes far more significant than it would be in the light of this embodied character of Hindu learning. The Islamic presence in India in many ways was a positive factor in promoting historiography but in this respect its impact may have been negative. The claim that the sheer destruction caused by political vicissitudes is responsible for the mistaken impression that the ancient Indians kept no historical records (because they are lost) however begs credulity. It sounds too superficial and smooth a response to the charge that ancient Indians possessed no sense of history, to the point of sounding apologetic. Our task then is to render it more plausible. One may begin by starting with an extreme position stated as follows: the perfect genocide is one which never occurred, because no one was left behind to tell the story. The point to be made is that the scale of destruction can be such as destroys the very evidence of that destruction. One then faces what might be called an evidentiary "black hole." Some evidence on the nature and scope of such destruction involved in the foreign invasions to which ancient India was subjected, needs to be introduced at this stage. After the fall of the Mauryan and then the Sufiga Empire, north India experienced a major political upheaval in the form of numerous</page><page sequence="32">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 221 invasions (Altekar 1995:350): The period of 500 years between 200 BC and 300 AD was a very dark and dismal one for Northern India. The fertile plains of the Punjab and the Gangetic valley were subjected during this period to one foreign invasion after another. First came the Greeks, who under Demetrius and Menander (c. 190-150 BC) were able to penetrate right up to Patna in Bihar, and then came Scythians and the Parthians (c. 100 BC to 50 AD). These ... were followed by the Kushanas, who succeeded in overrunning practically the whole of northern India by the middle of the 2nd century AD. The Gargisamihitd section of the Yuga Purdna assesses the damage caused by the invasion of Sakas as follows: caturbhdgam tu sastrena nadayisyanti praninam. Sakaih esam harisyanti caturbhagam svakami purari. Vinaste sakarajye tu fiinyd prthvT bhavisyati. In other words, these wars of conquest reduced the population of North India by "one half, 25 per cent being killed and 25 per cent being enslaved and car- ried away" (ibid.). The Yuga Purana (167) further informs us that dur- ing this period even women took to ploughing, presumably as a re- sult of this decimation (R.S. Sharma 1980:350).16 Indian opinion at the time seemed to blame AMoka's pacifism for this disaster, for the same Gargisamohita declares: "the fool established the so-called con- quest of dharma" (sthapayisyati mohatma vijayam nama dharmikam) (Raychaudhuri 1999:324 n. 3). This is not the place, however, to assess Adoka's rule but to point out in this context that some Indologists seem to overlook the implication of the scale of the destruction involved. While describing the state administration under the Mauryas, Hartmut Scharfe writes (as noted earlier): "In view of the careful bookkeep- ing in the aksa-patala the virtual absence of archives and chronicles in India is surprising; but the climate would destroy most documents" (Scharfe 1989:139 n. 114). Without discounting the role of climate one 16 Ram Sharan Sharma also finds evidence of this socio-economic crisis in a passage in the Manusmrti (viii.418) when he writes: "At another place Manu ordains that the king should carefully compel the vaifyas and the sfidras to perform the tasks assigned to them; since, if these two varnas swerve from their duties, they will throw the whole world into confusion. This passage is of particular importance, for it is not to be found in any earlier text" (1980:193).</page><page sequence="33">222 Arvind Sharma might wish to urge that the reason may not be just climatic but also "cli- mactic," if we use that expression to refer to the cataclysmic invasions just alluded to. Professor A.L. Basham perhaps comes closer to assess- ing the full significance of these invasions when he connects them with the Hindu conceptualizations of the Kaliyuga. He writes (1999:321): The end of the Kali-yuga, according to many epic passages, is marked by confusion of classes, the overthrow of established standards, the cessation of all religious rites, and the rule of cruel and alien kings. Soon after this the world is destroyed by flood and fire. This view is propounded strongly in texts, which date from about the beginning of the Christian era, when alien kings did in fact rule much of India, and established practices were shaken by heresies such as Buddhism and Jainism. An earlier tradition would place the Mahabharata War c. 900 BC, according to which the 1.200 years of the Kali-yuga, if read as human years and not as "years of the gods," would at this time be nearing their end. Evidently some pious Hindus thought that the dissolution of the cosmos was imminent. Perhaps it is to the departure of this fear in later times that we must attribute the devising of the "years of the gods," which made the dissolution of the world comfortable distant. We need only refer to the remarks about the Boar Incarnation made earlier to see the force of the point. It is also worth noting that after political stability was restored in North India under Gupta rule, the tradition of maintaining archives was also revived. According to the usually dependable testimony of Zuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) who visited India in the seventh century, detailed records were kept in each district during the reign of King Hara. These too have vanished -perhaps for the same reason as the Mauryan. It is worth recalling that by the end of the 12th century the two major universities of ancient India, those of Taksa"ila and Nalanda had disappeared. An example might help make the point. What prospect would we hold out for British historiography in the future, if the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were utterly destroyed today along with all the libraries. It is striking that even in the context of relatively proximate events, some of the conclusions reached earlier seem to apply in some degree. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister and himself a historian of some merit wrote in 1946 regarding the Indian mutiny of 1857-1858:</page><page sequence="34">Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? 223 The very circumstances of defeat and disruption prevented the Indian side of the story from being properly recorded, and many of the records that existed suffered destruction during the great revolt of 1857. The papers that survived were hidden away in family archives and could not be published for fear of consequences. They remained dispersed, little known, and many perished in the manuscript stage from the incursions of termites and other insects which abound in this country. At a later stage when some of these papers were discovered, they threw a new light on many historical incidents. (Nehru 1946:289). V One could offer the sensational conclusion that the claim that the Hindus lacked a sense of history may itself indicate a lack of a sense of history on our part -for to make such a claim is to overlook the fact that the very evidence of the fact that the Hindus possess it may have been lost on account of historical vicissitudes. But it is best to conclude on a sober note: that the proposition- that the Hindus lacked historical sense - is rendered questionable by the weight of the cumulative evidence presented above. The absence of historiography still needs to be explained; if anything, the need becomes even more acute. A parallel from the field of philosophy may be helpful here. Ancient India never produced philosophical texts of the modem European kind but it is no longer necessary to argue that India lacked a philosophical tradition, although this tradition never divorced itself from religion along the lines of Western philosophy. In a similar fashion, in the light of evidence presented above it seems difficult to sustain the proposition that the Hindus lacked a sense of history. Could it be that, as in the case of philosophy, it was also not divorced from a broader normative and liberatory context? Do both these facts have a common explanation?
