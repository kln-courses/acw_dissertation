<plain_text><page sequence="1">KATER MURR AND KÄTZCHEN SPIEGEL Hoffmann's and Keller's Uses of Felinity LEE B. JENNINGS UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO CIRCLE Animal stories, by nature and independently of genre, follow certain pat terns. They can be arranged roughly on a spectrum from their didactic use as vehicles for allegory and satire to the serious attempt to speak from the point of view of the animal. They range, then, from the didactic to the empathetic. The authors' motives, apart from traditionalism, also show inherent patterns. In the didactic area, the particular natures of certain animals provide a convenient vehicle for portraying human character traits. In a deeper sense, the lesser role of reason, and the greater role of instinct, in animal behavior invites comparison with human behavior, either implicitly chastising humans' imperfect pretensions at rationality or, in more primitivistic cases, advocating a return to greater instinctual vitality or innocence. At the empathetic end of the scale, the moving force may be pure compassion for our fellow creatures, but it is usually coupled with criticism of the human-chauvinistic tendencies of orthodox theology and rationalistic philosophy. Hoffmann's Kater Murr and Keller's Spiegel, das Kätzchen combine several of these tendencies, which we shall attempt to differentiate. That Murr is in some way Johannes Kreisler's counterpart, and thus an ego-projection of Hoffmann himself, is obvious from the basic structure of the work. The question is in what way Kreisler is mirrored in Murr, and why Hoffmann felt it necessary to mirror his hero at all. There are, of course, explanations in terms of «Romantic irony» and satire of the Philistine, but these have often been seized upon too readily. As an animal story, Kater Murr is complex. The element of compassionate empathy in some parts is strong. In these parts - e. g., Murr's kittenhood, the sensorial flooding attending his first eye-opening, his first reactions to the poodle Ponto, his feline reflexes - the narrative approaches a true speculative account of the experiences of an actual cat, albeit an unusually intelligent one, based on careful observation. In these parts, allowing for a generous interpretation of the capabilities of the animal psyche, anthropomorphism is at a minimum, and immediate rapport is great. ' Since these empathetic parts, as ego-projections, are likely to be closer, at least on a pre-verbal level, to the author's innermost views than are the didactic portions, we suggest that they deserve more credence and closer attention than they have usually received.</page><page sequence="2">Kater Murr and Kätzchen Spiegel 67 The premiss of Murr's learning to read and write, of course, places the story on a different reality-level and demands a further suspension of disbelief. Murr's poeticizing and philosophizing cross the boundary into the didactic and satirical. Finally, in the parts of the story in which a cat or dog society is posited - Murr's venture into the counterculture of feline Bur schentum or his unfortunate attempt to «crash» the canine salon of the whippet Badine - the didactic aspect obviously takes over. (We are asked to believe, for example, that the cat society grants medals to its mouse-massacre heroes.) It is the satiric parts which most obviously make points about aesthetics, morality, and social adaptation; but the points prove to be ambiguous. In the aesthetic realm, Murr emerges for the most part, in his poeticizing, as a conceited, posterity-oriented poetaster. His highflown rhetoric in describing his experiences is consistently undercut by the crassly materialis tic nature of the things being described.2 Hoffmann is obviously indulging in a none-too-veiled criticism of human poets here. The question is whether it is himself he is satirizing, or other poets not possessed of his own insight. To the modern reader, there seems to be an almost embarrassing similarity between Murr's overwrought rhetoric and that of the poetically sensitive characters in the Kreisler narrative. The easiest explanation is that Hoff mann, while not really doubting the need for hyperbolic emotionalism, indulgently pokes fun at it in some other corner of his mind, calling upon the Romantic tradition of noncommittal dissociation («Ironie»), There seems to be a basic difference in vocabulary, however, which suggests that Murr operates not so much in the tradition of the Romantic era as in that of Empfindsamkeit and thus represents an outmoded sentimentality which Kreisler, in his more «modern» grasping of essences, feels that he has gone beyond.' It has been proposed and denied that Murr is the Philistine of the tale, and indeed the point is unclear. Considering him for the moment as a human character, we would have to say that he indeed suggests a pedantic devotee of the classic Bildungsideal, who fails to perceive that the literary classicists of old were dealing with their own immediate experiences. Hoffmann, how ever, may have been vaguely aware that he was falling into the same trap, exploiting a more modern style, which he had helped to create, the more to mask a certain poverty of new experience in his work. The sagacious cat is the caricature of Hoffmann's old-fashioned literary opponents, but in a less ostensible way a caricature of Hoffmann himself and the modish affectations of his work. A disturbing feature of the fragmentary novel is that the Murr episodes, because of their picaresque concern with raw experience, are more</page><page sequence="3">68 Lee B. Jennings captivating than the idealistically overloaded Kreisler passages. The author appears to be of two minds also in dealing with the conflict between social adaption and conventional morality. Hoffmann makes use of the cat-dog dichotomy to make his point here, dogs, by nature, representing the more gregarious, extraverted, and socially compliant species. The parallel to Kreisler and to Hoffmann is evident. Kreisler's career depends on his acceptance into the fringes of an elite class and his recognition of its conventions, modes, and polite hypocrisies. While one can sympathize with his reflexive adaptation by means of a desperately contrived zaniness, one cannot help sympathizing also with the seasoned bureaucrats who find his behavior at times self-indulgent, peevish, and embarrassing. Kreisler's infighting with bureaucrats and nobles is at least as suspect and narcissisti cally flawed as is Murr's disenchantment with dogdom, where it is likewise unclear just where the author's sympathies lie. Murr, even as a kitten, expresses doubts about rationalistic idealism which seem to go beyond even Romantic antirationalism, which, after all, sought more to supplement the Enlightenment than to strike at its roots. Murr's sensual leanings do not so much betray Romantic idealism as they reflect its attenuation to the point of existential doubt. He strongly suggests that reason is the product of experience rather than being innate, and that morality, if innate at all, is strongly encouraged by a rap on the head after clawing one's master.4 He minimizes the role of instinct in animal behavior, by implication ridiculing our own attempts to minimize this important factor. Murr does cling stubbornly to the Kantian test of universality,5 but it is severely shaken when, having lost his way, he is instructed in survival techniques by the poodle Ponto: either one ingratiates oneself shamelessly with the powerful humans, says Ponto, or one gets no sausage.6 Murr's amours bring home to him the basic cycle of desire and satiation, otherwise seldom commented upon except by Schopenhauer. A period of self-indulgence bears out Murr's difficulty in distinguishing between the pleasures of the spirit and of the senses, certainly a central problem, if not primarily a culinary one, for Hoffmann also.7 Murr, to be sure, is denounced at one point as a Philistine by the feline agitator Muzius, who, however, understands the term as applying to everyone outside his own radical faction, devoted, as it is, to contrivedly old-German bravado and automatic scorn of the bourgeois. When Murr attempts to enter canine high society, he reflects on the role of the exceptional person, the intellectual or artist, within the beau monde and comes to favor a balanced view, avoiding both undue humility and obstreperousness. Doubt is cast on this seemingly mature and reasoned compromise, however. He is eventually brought to his senses, and out of his conciliatory mood, by</page><page sequence="4">Kater Murr and Kätzchen Spiegel 69 manifestations of ineradicable prejudice, here portrayed as that of dog against cat - a recognition of an existing social evil, but a somewhat easy dismissal of the adaptation problem inherent in all society. (If cats are not accepted, it must be because of the dogs about them.) Perhaps the darkest reflections occur in the burlesque feline funeral oration of Hinzmann upon the death of Muzius, where the orator naively comments on the deceased's life of virtue, while his examples show that in actuality the deceased was virtuous only when it suited him (he was unfaithful to his mate only when overpowered by lust, etc.). The orator goes on to say that the deceased has now found eternal peace, though, since everyone finds this anyhow, it does seem to him that there must be some other reason for leading a life of virtue - though he cannot think what it is.s Thus, in the story of Murr, some basic doubts emerge which are not so directly expressed in Hoffmann's other writing. The subhuman character stands for physical man, whose needs are subverted by an antiquated idealism. Though the fate of the sensitive individual is ostensibly of less consequence here than in the Kreisler narrative, it is also here that the real enemy, class prejudice and material need, rather than the workings of some demonic fate, is most squarely faced, and dictums about the purpose of life most profoundly questioned. Radical activity is seen as no answer, and the Golden Rule is largely upheld, but the basic tenets of idealistic philosophy as a guide to living come into some question, the advantages of social adaptation are most seriously weighed, and a Brechtian situation-ethic is for a time persuasively argued.9 As Michael T. Jones has observed,10 Murr's social adaptability is not really approved of, but it is through the creature misery of Murr that Hoffmann shows how very demanding society and material conditions can be. Murr's adaptability may smack of cynicism and brainwashed compliance, thus discrediting its legitimacy, but Kreisler's vision, in its solipsism, has its drawbacks too." Hoffmann does not relinquish the vision that sets the artist apart; but he subjects it here to a severe test. It is Murr who confronts the real world in the work, and he does so with indomitable resilience. Something of Hoffmann's own life force is projected into him, and it is with true regret that we read of his demise in the brief epilogue. Keller's «Spiegel, das Kätzchen» is of course not a kitten, but a fullgrown tomcat. The diminutive suffix is one of indulgent endearment. We are told that the name «Spiegel» refers to his sleek coat, but this is unconvincing.12 He is, no doubt, intended to serve as a mirror for the author and for the reader as well. As in Hoffmann's tale, a good part of the story can be taken as an</page><page sequence="5">70 Lee B. Jennings empathetic attempt to convey the real experience of a cat, and the feline mannerisms are accurately adhered to, gently reminding us of our own simian reflexes and the frequent hypocrisy of our belief in our «higher nature». The choice of the cat as a mirror for humans seems similarly motivated. The cat is a creature of apparent sagacity, domesticated but governed by powerful drives, alternately ingratiating and fiercely indepen dent, comfort-seeking and ascetic, a bourgeois with a bad conscience. The cat, judged by human social values, has the air of an «outsider» and may thus assume either a «rebel» or a «dreamer» aspect when anthropomorphized. Both aspects appear in both authors' feline protagonists. In Keller's tale, the anthropomorphisms necessary for plot development are disposed of by reversion to a fairy-tale-like past, when there were actual sorcerers and witches, able to communicate directly with animals. It has been claimed that the more sovereignly catlike Spiegel is the antithesis of Murr, in that the humor in his case arises from the reader's inference of human parallels to his self-confident animal behavior; whereas in the case of Murr, who mistakenly aspires to the most insidiously blamewor thy and pretentious features of man, the humor lies in his inadvertent relapses into bestiality.'' This view, however, ignores the sameness of the two intrepid toms in their most vital, vulnerable, and innocent aspects. Crucial here is the author's attitude toward animality; is it a lapse, or a healthy reversion? It is the latter possibility which has tended to be overlooked. Spiegel is first represented as embodying, within the limitations of his nature, the ideals of maturity and moderation that Keller holds dear. Like his creator, he is well-disposed toward reasonable people and scratches those who are, to his mind, irredeemably selfish and unrefined. His infrequent passionate excursions are regarded tolerantly. His contented philosophical observations, however, are interrupted by the death of his mistress, and, deprived of home and sustenance, he becomes greedy and cowardly, and his cleverness and reason desert him. In his despair he enters into a bargain with the town witch-doctor Pineiß, who is to feed him sumptuously for a time and then slaughter him for his badly-needed cat-grease. With increased nutri ment, Spiegel's philosophical insight returns, spurred by an epiphany of mortality as he examines the tidily-packed stomach of a bird he is eating. He resolves to practice dietary moderation again and finally goes on an amorous escapade, losing the last of the fat he had accumulated. The denouement is less important for our purposes. Spiegel outwits the sorcerer, playing on his greed with a tale of hidden treasure, and, with the help of a friendly owl, marrying him off to a Beguine lay sister, a grimly pious hypocrite able, at times, to assume the form of a voluptuous young witch.</page><page sequence="6">Kater Murr and Kätzchen Spiegel 71 What Keller is against is obvious in the story: false piety, mercenary greed, undue timidity and undue brashness, even undue righteousness when it begins to verge on conceit. What he is for is not so clear. The non-human hero obscures the picture. We are not sure whether the behavior regarded so indulgently in a tomcat is recommended also for humans. Like Murr, Spiegel shows tendencies toward a relativized situation-ethic when his survival is at stake. He tells an elaborate lie to save his skin. Even at the hands of a thoroughly reprehensible opponent, his standpoint seems idealistically ques tionable. What is even more unsettling, we sense from his example that the most convincingly mature, moderate, and tempered outlook can vanish overnight in the face of material distress. It has been noted that Keller's criticism of material acquisitiveness is especially severe in this deceptively fairy-tale-like work.14 On the other hand, Keller is especially mindful here also of the force of material circumstances and the fragility of humanitarian ideals. There is an inherent reductionism in the animal story, but it is double edged. The failure of animals to conform to human standards is expected, but it may imply that humans are more animal than they care to admit. Neither Hoffmann nor Keller was unacquainted with poverty and its eroding effect upon human decency. Both tended to blame (in a modest way) the evils of their society for the lack of satisfying life-conditions - in Hoffmann's case, class prejudice, feudal rigamarole, mindless rationalism, inflated cultural pretensions and faddishness; in Keller's case, primarily the tendency of his society to value the appearance of respectability over the true civic virtues which he rightly sensed to be losing their reason for being. It is seldom that either author questions the primacy of the categorical imperative, or the benevolent, progressive, and human-oriented arrangement of the cosmos, whether it is arranged by Providence or by a Hegelian Weltgeist. Neither seems to believe that basic morality is more than temporarily affected by material need, neither seriously considers that this might be a relative and socially determined matter - except when these authors speak more freely, through the mouths of perspicacious animals. The reduction of personality which their assumption of animal roles brings with it injects a healthy tone of skeptical materialism into their writing, and the adventures of the naively roguish animal persona provides an experiential pragmatism of outlook found largely in the English prose of the period and often missed in its German counterpart. Hoffmann and Keller prove to have nearly the same standpoint here. Hoffmann is realist enough to appear ahead of his time. Keller is still idealist enough to appear slightly behind his.</page><page sequence="7">72 Lee B.

Lehens-Ansichten des Katers Murr, ed. Walter Müller Seidel (München: Winkler, n. d.), pp. 305, 320-21. Hereafter abbreviated: ET/KM. Murr states: «Ich glaube überhaupt, daß man sich das Bewußtsein nur angewöhnt; durch das Leben und zum Leben kommt man doch, man weiß selbst nicht wie» (p. 304); further: «Je mehr Kultur, desto weniger Freiheit, das ist ein wahres Wort» (p. 320). 5 ET/KM, p. 400: »... ein jeder müsse so handeln, daß seine Handelsweise als allgemeines Prinzip gelten könne, oder wie er wünsche, daß alle rücksichts seiner handeln möchten« ; cf.

Meyer's claim that Murr's adaptation of the Kantian principle makes a mockery of it seems extreme. 6 ET/KM, pp. 390, 398-400. «... denn hungrige Leute sind viel artiger, und fügsamer, als satte» (p. 399). 7 ET/KM, p. 485: «Unglückliche träumerische Verwechslung des geistigen und leiblichen Genusses!» 8 ET/KM, p. 580: «Zwar will es mich beinahe bedünken, daß wir alle, so wie wir hier zusammen sitzen und heulen um den Freund, zu der Ruhe kommen würden, ohne gerade so ein Ausbund von aller Tugend zu sein als er und daß es wohl noch ein anderes Motiv geben müsse tugendhaft zu sein, als gerade die Sehnsucht nach dieser Ruhe, indessen ist das nur solch ein Gedanke, den ich euch zu fernerer Bearbeitung überlasse.» ' Singer notes the essential denunciation of the ideals and culture of the Age of Goethe in the work (p. 305), as well as the emphasis on instinct and innocence at the expense of intellectual profundity (pp. 308-9). 10 Michael T.

Hayes finds the attitude of the Kreisler-type hero to be asocial and fatuous - though he credits Hoffmann's outsider-standpoint with some acuity in the pinpointing of social evils.
