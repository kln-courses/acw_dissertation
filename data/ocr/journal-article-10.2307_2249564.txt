<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spinoza, Descartes and Maimonides. BY LFON ROTH. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1924. Pp. 148. THE time has long passed, if it ever existed, when the philosophy of Spinoza could be regarded merely as a rationalised Cartesianism. Few will be disposed to, deny the influence of the great mediaval Jews on, not only the theological opinions of Spinoza (where it is direct), but also on the philosophical teachings embodied in the Ethics and the other treatises. But Mr. Roth's purpose in this valuable little volume goes beyond these easy admissions: he seeks to set Spinoza forth as a conscious opponent of the central logical and metaphysical doctrines of Descartes, standing to the Cartesian School much in the same relation as Moses ben Maimon stood to the Kalam. " The main the?is of the present essay," he says,</page><page sequence="2">LEON ROTH, Spinoza, Descartes and Maimonides 457 "is that in his defence of traditional belief the Arabic theologian was led to construct a metaphysical system which in logical essentials is precisely the samne as that adopted long after by Descartes; while that in his attack on and rejection of this systemb Maimnonides urged the same objections and put forward the same positive grounds of reconstrutction as were used against Descartes by Spinoza" (p. 68, author's italics). The argument, which is ably marshalled, is divided into four sections: the first deals with the logical bases and main results of Descartes's philosophy, and is, as a whole, a dis- criminating but not too sympathetic study. Considerable emphasis is placed upon the Cartesian criterion of truth in ideas, viz., their clarity and distinctness, which is interpreted as meaning thab the true idea is the self-complete, discrete idea. This again is held to imply that there is no unitary active mind at all (p. 19) since the mind is the ideas, and these are atomic. Nor, on this basis, can there be any real thought transitions in the absence of some unifying agency, and it was to fulfil this need that God was introduced as the synthetic unity of the discrete elements, making science or a whole of know- ledge possible. Hence the " supreme importance" of the proof of God's existence. Against this logical and physical atomism result- ing in a pluralistic scepticism, the philosophy of Spinoza was fundamentally and consciously directed. Mr. Roth seeks to bring out this result in the second section of the book in which the main lines of Spinoza's teaching are, a little disappointingly, sketched. Spinoza's unfinished logical treatise De Intellectus Emendatione is, we are told, " specifically directed against any logical theory which sets out . . . from the individual idea as discrete " (p. 53). There are no 'things' in nature, no discrete objects, and in mind which reflects nature there are no discrete ideas. " The very essence of an idea lies in its connexion with other ideas. There is, in fact, only one idea, i.e., the systematic unity of all ideas, as there is only one thing, the systematic unity of all things" (p. 54). In a word, the true idea is not the discrete but the concrete idea. I do not, of course, quarrel with the obvious truth contained in this exposition. Spinoza is certainly much clearer on these matters than his predecessor. Nor do I deny that Descartes often lends himself to an atomistic interpretation-so oftea4, in fact, that he must be held to have leaned definitely to that side. But is it not a little hard on him to be faced three hundred years after his time with a 'Yea or Nay?' made possible by a subsequent development guided by the more penetrating vision of Spinoza ? And although the theory of Spinoza is more self-conscious and satisfying than that of Descartes I cannot, at present, agree that it is simply opposed to it. Mr. Roth is, perhaps, a little obsessed by the apparent opposition of the 'discrete' and the 'concrete,' and has not been sufficiently disposed to take the De Intellectus Emnendatione at its face value. " Ideas which are clear and distinct can never be false: for the ideas of things which are clearly and distinctly con- ceived are either themselves the simplest or are composed of, that is to say deduced from, the simplest ideas. That, in truth, a per- 0</page><page sequence="3">458 CRITICAL NOTICES: fectly simple idea cannot be false everyone can see if only he realises what a truth is or what the intellect is, and also what is meant by a falsehood " (De Intell. Emend., ? 68). And the implica- tion is that falsity rather than truth, arises from the compounding of ideas, and the truth of a compound idea is once more determined by its internal clearness and distinctness. We can no longer en- tertain the fiction of a square circle when we clearly understand what' a square is and what a circle is. In so far as an idea is internally coherent, and therefore discrete, it is true (and only in so far). In a word, the concrete idea is true if it is discrete. The further conclusion that only one such idea is wholly or perfectly discrete does not invalidate the logical analysis, but depends upon it. It is in view of a relation such as this between Spinoza and Descartes that Edward Caird made the assertion deprecated by Mr. Roth (p. 124) that "'in the Spinozistic philosophy there are few differences from Descartes which cannot be traced to the necessary development of Cartesian principles": a saying which, as it stands, by no means rules out the influence of Maimonides, or makes Spinoza a mere Cartesian. In any case necessary develop- ments issue sometimes in opposites! Mr. Roth might well consider whether in his reaction from the " conventional judgement " (p. 143) of the relations of Spinoza and Descartes he has not allowed his thesis to suggest a mere opposition where there is really dialectical development by a mind less versatile than that of Descartes but wholly given to philosophy. I cannot think, for example (p. 43), that Spinoza has Descartes specially in mind in the polemical Appendix to Part I. of the Ethics: even in that work, where re- ferences are exceptional, he does not hesitate to name Descartes (and, as I read him, with great respect) on occasion given. The third section of the book brings us to Maimonides and presents us with an informative study of the "Guide for thte Per- plexed " and its historical context. Even here, however, Mr. Roth's interest is in Spinoza and overweights the exposition. The whole book is emphatically a book about Spinoza, and the reader is led at every page to questions of comparison and influence. The result is that imperceptibly we are led to expect a greater claim of direct debt than the author has it in his mind to make. He does not forget that " Rabbi Mloyses " was influential beyond the Jewish schools, and that scholastic and other influences from the middle ages were not to be thrown off by a Descartes, or even by a Spinoza, by a mere act of will: indeed, his thesis is that some of them were not. Objecting, then, to the assertion by Prin- cipal Caird that the " occasional coincidences " of Spinoza and the medileval Jewish philosophers "are such only to the ear," Mr. Roth himself comes to the not altogether dissimilar conclusion that "if we had to sum up our view of the relations between Spinoza and Maimonides in a few words, it would be difficult to find any more appropriate than memini olim legisse" (p. 104). I do not say that that is negligible: much less might be highly important, and</page><page sequence="4">LEON ROTH, Spinoza, Descartes and Maimonides. 459 that, in fact, is the line taken by Mr. Roth. Maimonides provided " the primary and permanent background " for Spinoza, the notion of " the universe ass a totality through which alone it is possible to know God" (p. 105); and not only that: the influence " extended far beyond general principles " (p. 106). It is to the substantiation of this last assertion that the fourth, and concluding, section of the work is devoted. In the main the discussion centres about three points of agree- ment or analogy. The first carries very little weight: it consists in a common rejection of anthropomorphism in theology. The second is more important and centres in the doctrine of iniaginatio. Ac- cording to Mr. Roth this notion was not derived by Spinoza from Descartes who uses the term in a confused way and bases nothing important on it. In Maimonides, however, there is to be found a characteristic triple division of grades of knowledge. Correspond- ing to Spinoza's imaginatio there is " the perceptive knowledge of the -ordinary man " and the theologian, standing in the way of adequate knowledge of the incorporeality, simplicity, infinity and eternity of God; corresponding, to mtio there is the scientific knowledge of the scientist and Aristotelian philosopher; and corresponding to -scientia intuitiva there is prophecy. And just as scientia intuitiva combines the excellences without the defects of both ratio and imaginatio so, according to Maimonides, prophecy is a higher fusion of perception and science. No doubt these features do suggest prima facie an important parallelism, but a much fuller discussion and more evidence than Mr. Roth adduces will be required to render less dubitable his conclusion that the Mai- monidean 'prophecy' is " the source of the doctrine of scientia intuitiva in Spinoza" (p. 134). After all, triplicities and syntheses have been invented both before Maimonides and since Spinoza: it is the content of the moments that is important, not the archi- tectonics. The third point of agreement adduced is in the theory of intel- lectual immortality. On this I make no comment beyond pointing out that others have put forward similar theories from the time of Aristotle, and further that, though Mr. Roth adds some very interest- ing suggestions, the theory of Spinoza has not yet received its -definitive exposition. Mr. Roth's book as a whole is a brilliant and painstaking and mature piece of work, and I should be very sorry if any criticism of mine should suggest the contrary. It is difficult if not impossible justly to indicate the indirect origins and streams of influence in the fused content of philosophies far removed in time from our own. There are pitfalls from which we are not safe even when conscious of their existence. This is perhaps especially the case with a long ponde'red system such as that of Spinoza, and Mr. Roth has shown temerity in attempting a piece of work so well worth the doing. We shall look out for further studies of the same kind from the British secretary of the Societas Spinozana. H. F. HALLETT.</page></plain_text>
