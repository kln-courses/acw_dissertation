How did you discover that for yourself? ttw: I think that a notion of rootedness, of homeland, is in each of us, and  each of us defi nes it differently. For me it’s in Utah. Four, fi ve, six genera- tions of my family are deeply rooted in the Great Basin and the American  West. My family is Mormon. We literally came over in a Handcart Com- pany in the 1800s and sought spiritual refuge in the Salt Lake Valley. So  I’ve never really been able to separate family, spirituality, landscape, and  home. But I think that we all have our own stories. Some of these stories  are about rootedness, and some of them may be about rootlessness. But I  think that we need to pay attention. jt: I want to go back to your grandmother, Mimi. You begin your book, An  Unspoken Hunger, by mentioning Mimi and seashells. And you also share  Mimi in your other book, Refuge. So I want to talk about her. Tell me the  story of Mimi. ttw: Well, I carry her with me. And, as you know, she is a powerful mentor  of mine. I say ‘is’ because, even though she died in 1989, her spirit is  still present, as I think all of our grandmothers’ spirits are with us, liv- ing or dead. The story that I tell in An Unspoken Hunger is something  that happened when I was seven or eight. Mimi said, “Terry, I have a  wonderful winter project for us.” And she brought out this huge, huge  bowl of shells that she had collected on her various journeys to the Pacifi c  Ocean in California. And so we got out fi eld guides, picture books, en- cyclopedias, a blue ballpoint pen, and some adhesive tape, and we would  pick one shell and then pore through the fi eld guides until she said, “Ah,  here it is—what does this word say? What does this picture evoke?” And  we would talk about this white shell with a pink lip, and she would say,  “Yes, pink murex.” And then we would write the name “pink murex” on  the adhesive tape, break it off, put on the mouth of the shell, and put it  in the bowl. And we would repeat that process for other shells: olivella  shells, angel wings, cowries, melongena. This was a wonderful introduc- tion into taxonomy—not only to naming things, but also to the sensu- ality of nature in objects. And then, when we were through and it was  time for bed, I would take a bath and take the shells with me into the  tub—somehow recreating this ocean environment even in the most small, intimate way. 22 </page> <page sequence="3"> Wild Heart jt: What does the naming do? Can you take us back to you as a seven year  old learning the name of something? What does that feel like? ttw: I think it’s about familiarizing ourselves, don’t you? We say that the names  matter, and then we say that the names don’t matter. You know: I see the  mountain, I don’t see the mountain, I see the mountain. But for me, as  a child and now as a woman, as a naturalist, the names still matter to me  because it’s about recognizing who we live among. So whether it’s Cali- fornia gull, black-necked stilt, American avocet, grizzly bear, coyote, or  the names of shells—melongena, cowry, pink murex, whelk—one word  evokes an entire narrative, an entire story connected to place. jt: That reminds me of when you met a woman in New York City as you  were naming these different animals and rocks and shells. Could you tell  us that story? ttw: Certainly. I was an intern at the American Museum of Natural History in  New York, and I worked with a wonderful woman, Lee Miller, who had  a very strong sense of place that was rooted in Pelham Bay Park, near the  Bronx. It was an extraordinary experience to go out with her. When we  went on a collecting trip for the museum gathering invertebrates—kil- lifi sh, clams, so forth—I got to see the world through her eyes. When I  fi rst went out with her I had my Western bias and was horrifi ed at what  the people in New York considered “wetlands.” But as I began to see the  world through her eyes, I realized that it takes so little to sustain life that,  even in these wetlands that had been drained, dredged, and dumped in,  there was life in all its vitality—even a Black Crowned Night heron stand- ing in the reeds staring at us.  jt: So we can fi nd that sense of place and that sense of the natural wherever  we are. ttw: I think so, don’t you? jt: I do. I keep getting this image of these delicate little plants, delicate little  fl owers, that will come up through the cracks of the cement. If left alone,  they just take over the cement in no time.  ttw: Yes, there are these remnants of wildness all around us. And then I think  about the large open spaces of wildness that we still have in this country,  particularly in the American West. We still have a chance to do something  right by embracing these wild places, by offering legislative protection. If we  don’t, if we allow everything to become urbanized, if we allow everything to  be an object of our exploitations, what will be the cost? What will the loneli- ness be that we suffer as a result of our lack of attention to wildness? 23 </page> <page sequence="4"> A Voice in the Wilderness jt: And I know you speak from a deep-feeling place. Recently, my partner Mi- chael and I traveled up to Oregon by car. I hadn’t been up through the  Northern part of California in a long time, and it felt so wonderful to be  amongst the big trees again, just to be in the presence of these enormous  consciousnesses and to see wild elk right off the highway. And this is your  life. You go out into nature, into the wilderness, all the time—is that right? ttw: I can’t separate my life from that. And as you speak, as you evoke these  images of the Pacifi c Northwest, of driving into Oregon and feeling the  presence of ancestors—the ancient forests—my heart is just pierced be- cause the other side of what you are feeling can be summed up in one  word: clearcut. And what is the result? I think about how, for all practical  purposes, the Tahoe salmon are gone as we know them, that less than a  hundred years ago, stories are told of the native peoples who lived there  that you could literally walk across the backs of salmon to reach the other  side of the river. Now we’re lucky if we see one or two. What does that  mean? What does that mean in terms of our idea of community? What  does that mean, again, in terms of the sustainability of our relations, deep  relations? So more than ever before, I feel both the joy of wildness and  the absolute pain in terms of what we are losing. And I think we’re afraid  of inhabiting, of staying in this landscape of grief, yet if we don’t acknowl- edge the grief, if we don’t acknowledge the losses, then I feel we won’t be  able to step forward with compassionate intelligence to make the changes  necessary to maintain wildness on the planet. jt: You talk about the paradox of feeling the joy in what is still available and  the pain of what we are losing. Let’s stay with the paradox for a moment.  How does it help us to stay there and feel both of those places? ttw: I don’t know, except that I believe it’s a dance. And I believe that it makes  us more human. I love Clarice Lispector when she writes in her book,  An Apprenticeship, “and what human beings want more than anything else  is to become human beings.” If we don’t allow ourselves to feel the full  range of emotion—deep joy and deep pain—then I think we are less than  who we can be. jt: Right now we are working on how to get along with each other, and, in  reading your words, and knowing you, I suspect that you see a connection  between really being present to the natural world and really being able to  relate to each other as human beings. ttw: I think that’s very true. I think of my uncle, Alan, the subject of the essay  in An Unspoken Hunger called “The Village Watchman.” Though there is  24 </page> <page sequence="5"> Wild Heart no mention of environment or landscape in that essay, and yet I think that  he has been one of my most powerful teachers of what an ecological life  might mean. He was 10 years my senior, and I remember a conversation  that I had with him at my Grandma’s house when I was eight or nine. I re- member saying to him, “How are you doing?” And he said, “Ask me how  I’m feeling.” And I said, “Okay, how are you feeling?” And he said, “Right  now, today?” “Yes.” “I am very happy, and I am very sad.” And I remem- ber thinking, how can that be, how can we hold two opposing views in  our mind at once? And then he said, “They live in the same house, didn’t  you know?”    This is paradoxical ability that we have to hold opposing views in our  mind at once, in our heart at once. Alan—and he was someone who, in  our culture would be called “mentally retarded,” or “mentally disabled,”  and all of the labels we put on people—had such an insight into a life of  greater intention. And more than anything else, Alan taught me what it  means to live and love with a broken heart. And when you say, “So what  good does this do us?” I think that, if we feel these kinds of emotions, it  enables us to live in the landscape of compassion and to live in the world  with a sense of empathy.  jt: So you’re really talking about asking new questions, or asking questions  in a different way. ttw: I think so. And I think that if we could begin to look at the world in the  context of “other”—other creatures, other forms of life—that our world  would be defi ned differently. jt: We live in a society where people are being laid off from jobs, jobs are  switching, jobs are changing, companies are downsizing, people are look- ing for new work and trying to fi gure out what they are going to do with  their lives. And at the same time our communities are having a hard time  keeping the systems going—the fi re support systems, the school systems,  and the libraries, and so forth. We have all of these people-to-people  problems to focus on in our communities, and what you are talking is ex- panding the question to also include something else. How can we afford  to do that? ttw: How can we afford not to do that? I think of two stories, if you don’t  mind me sharing. First, the Second Morelia Symposium was held this  year in Morelia, Mexico. The fi rst Morelia Symposium was held in 1991  in anticipation of the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. This second sym- posium was held in January, in anticipation of the conference in Cairo  25 </page> <page sequence="6"> A Voice in the Wilderness in September, 1994, talking about population and development. At the  symposium, writers, poets, environmentalists, scientists, population bi- ologists, and humanists gathered together to think about these things.  The symposium produced a declaration. This time, our emphasis was on  questions. What questions might we ask? What questions might we set  before our world leaders to consider? And we came up with eight. May I  share them with you? jt: Oh please do. ttw: I think this is a response to your question, “can we afford to do this?” We  and our leaders might ask ourselves: 1) How can we consider environmen- tal protection to be a luxury? 2) What will happen if we continue to insist  on dominance, instead of balance, at the expense of every other species?  3) Will the child of the next century see a monarch butterfl y, a tiger, or a  grizzly bear, or walk in the forest in Malaysian Borneo, Mexico’s Lacan- don Wilderness, or anywhere in West Africa? 4) Why is the production  of a machine gun treated as economically desirable, while cleaning a river  from which people must drink is considered a costly extravagance? 5)  How realistic are offi cial environmental policies that ignore the overcon- sumption and population crises? 6) Why are we afraid to offer adequate  information on reproductive health services to our youth? 7) What will  our money be worth when we have turned the Earth into a wasteland?  And 8) Do you think these questions have anything to do with you? If so,  what can we do about that? jt: I’m speaking with Terry Tempest Williams, the author of An Unspoken  Hunger. My name is Justine Toms. You’re listening to New Dimensions.  [music break] jt: Those wonderful sounds of our kin were produced—or were taken, they  weren’t produced—but they were recorded by Paul Winter on an album  called A Prayer for the Wild Things. ttw: I love that album. It’s so wonderful, speaking of “other.” Justine, I was  going to say, when you asked about jobs—and so often we bring that idea  up when we’re talking about the environment. “Well if we preserve the  environment, then what about jobs?” There is a wonderful metaphor of  this, and an actual example, in one of the rainforests in Central Mexico  where there is a sanctuary for monarch butterfl ies, where they all mi- grate—23 million, if you can imagine. We were in the middle of this, and,  as Bill McKibben was saying, it was as though we were inside the “Mind  of God.” If you can imagine 23 million individuals . . . 26 </page> <page sequence="7"> Wild Heart jt: You know, I really can’t imagine that. ttw: I couldn’t either. Imagine one monarch butterfl y fl apping its wings, mul- tiplied by 23 million. It was a sound unlike anything I have ever heard in  my life. The only way I can describe it to you is that, when you are outside  of that sound, you are absolutely gripped with an almost inconsolable  loneliness. But the villagers there—there are individuals in the village  whose sole job is to pick up monarchs off of the trail and place them back  into the arms of the trees. Or, if there is an element of shade on the trail,  these gentlemen, these children, will pick up the butterfl ies and put them  into pockets of sunshine so that their wings become full again.    I think that is honest work.  jt: Oh, that really takes my heart and opens it. ttw: Isn’t that wonderful? jt: That reminds me of a woman in Kenya, and you tell a story in your book,  An Unspoken Hunger, about the planting of trees, about women and plant- ing trees. Can you talk about that? ttw: Yes, Wangari Maathai,1 I think, is one of the most potent human beings on  the Earth right now, and it’s her vision that one person does make a differ- ence and that the gesture looms large in the scheme of things. She started  the Greenbelt movement in the 1970s with the idea that rural women in  Africa, in Kenya, were carrying the environmental crisis on their backs— literally, in terms of carrying fi rewood—and that the degradation of the  earth was literally being carried in their bodies. So she asked, “Why not  gather indigenous seeds in the folds of our skirts?” Women would gather  the seeds and plant them in nurseries, and then, as the plants grew, they  would give these plants back to the women in the villages who would  plant them on their land. It was an erosional measure, it was about fruit  trees, and it was about restoring a forest that was in the process of degra- dation. And then she placed this in the hands of the children. And now,  15 years later, millions of trees have been planted in Kenya. One woman’s  vision inspired other women’s visions, which inspired the children. I think  this is a marvelous story, and it gives me great hope and faith for what is  possible in terms of restoration and healing on the earth. jt: That reminds me of women in general and the image of the bear. I think  of the bear as a very female presence, and I think of the ferocity of a  1. Wangari Maathai (b. 1940) was awarded the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for the ac- tivities that Williams describes in this interview. 27 </page> <page sequence="8"> A Voice in the Wilderness mother bear. People think of the feminine spirit as very gentle, but there’s  also part that, when stirred, will do anything to protect its young, or to  protect something that is important. It can be very fi erce. And you have  a whole chapter of different facets of the bear in your book, An Unspoken  Hunger. Can you tell us what the bear represents for you? ttw: Again, we’re talking about mentors, whether it’s Wangari Maathai or  whether it’s a grizzly. For me, the bear embodies these opposing views, that  we can be both fi erce and compassionate at once. The bear is above ground  in spring and summer and below ground, hibernating, in fall and winter— and she emerges with young by her side. I think that’s a wonderful model  for us, particularly as women. And it’s one I’ve tried to adopt. From the Day  of the Dead2 until April Fool’s Day I’m home, and “home” consists of being  with my husband Brooke, of writing, of whatever that creative time may be.  So I think the bear offers us a model of how one lives with that paradox, of  a public and private life, of a creative life as well as a life of obligation.    I also think that the bear encompasses the mysteries—that the fear of  women and the fear of bears may be in our refusal to be tamed, the instincts  we arouse. So I think the bear encompasses so much of our own mythology,  not mention its own natural history, which largely remains a mystery to us.  And I think about the places that the bear has inhabited in North America,  and of the places now that are quiet because it is no longer there.  jt: I was just thinking of John McPhee writing about observing a bear in  Alaska fi nding something to sit on and actually sliding down a slope.  There is a sense of playfulness in bears, of fun, of joy. Other animals seem  this way as well—the coyote, maybe, has humor. ttw: Right! We’re so cautious not to place anthropomorphic views on animals,  but it’s hard not to. Doug Peacock, who is as intimate with bears with  anyone I know, has wonderful footage, a fi lm of watching bears in Glacier  National Park. One bear that he calls “Happy Bear” is literally trying to  walk on ice and keeps falling through, but the delight of that summer  morning is conveyed—early, early summer, with the snows melting in the  high country. It’s hard not to stand back and smile at the absolute sheer  delight that we see in landscape. jt: We have a lot of buzzards around here, and they are up so high, you  know, that they can’t be looking for food; they’re just fl ying for the sheer  2. The Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) is celebrated in Mexico on November 1  of each year. 28 </page> <page sequence="9"> Wild Heart fun of fl ying. I’m convinced that they are just enjoying the updrafts, the  bliss of that. ttw: That’s right. In fact, I’ve heard stories told by friends who live in Jackson  Hole, Wyoming, that they have seen white pelicans . . .  jt: Maybe we can talk about the white pelicans in just a moment. I’m speak- ing with Terry Tempest Williams, the author of An Unspoken Hunger.  You’re listening to New Dimensions.  [music break] jt: I’m here with Terry Tempest Williams, and we’re talking about the land- scape that we live in, that we’re connected to, that we’re part of. And you  were speaking about a climbing guide, a guide who . . .  ttw: I know, I get so excited because we’re telling stories. There’s a wonderful  climbing guide, Jack Turner, who lives in Moose, Wyoming. He told us  this story that they were up on top of the Grand Teton, 13,000+ feet, and  he heard this clapping sound, and he couldn’t imagine what that would  be in this landscape of rock and sky. He looked up above him, and there  were these circling, spiraling white pelicans. Can you imagine? He was so  stunned and in awe of this, and he just held the moment. And when he got  back down home, he started reading everything he could about pelicans  What could this clicking sound, this clapping sound, be? No mention.  And then there was this one citation that said, “Perhaps it is ecstasy; per- haps it is just the sheer bliss of circling at that elevation.” And why not? jt: Why not? You have a reading for us that I’d like you to share.  ttw: This is from “Undressing the Bear,” and again, Justine, it talks about the  opposing views, the paradoxical response we have to the world that we  embrace as human beings and that we see in the animal world:  Last spring, our family was in Yellowstone. We were hiking along Pelican  Creek, which separated us from an island of lodgepole pines. All at once, a dark  form stood in front of the forest on a patch of snow. It was a grizzly, and behind  her, two cubs. Suddenly, the sow turned and bolted through the trees. A female  elk crashed through the timber to the other side of the clearing, stopped, and  swung back toward the bear. Within seconds, the grizzly emerged with an elk  calf, secure in the grip of her jaws. The sow shook the yearling violently by the  nape of its neck, threw it down, clamped her claws on its shoulders, and began  tearing the fl esh back from the bones with her teeth. The cow elk, only a few  feet away, watched the sow devour her calf. She pawed the earth desperately  with her front hooves, but the bear was oblivious. Blood dripped from the sow’s  29 </page> <page sequence="10"> A Voice in the Wilderness muzzle. The cubs stood by their mother, who eventually turned the carcass over  to them. Two hours passed. The sow buried the calf for a later meal. She slept  on top of the mound with a paw on each cub. It was not until then that the elk  crossed the river in retreat.3 jt: Such a powerful image. That reminds me, you mention in your book that you  spent some time with Edward Abbey, just talking about storytelling—and he  was a storyteller, and one that roamed about the rich landscape. Tell us about  him. What was your memory and feeling for him? He died in 1989. ttw: He did. I think that, for so many of us in this country connected with  the conservation movement, Edward Abbey spoke to all of us, whether it  was Desert Solitaire, whether it was the Monkey Wrench Gang, or his essays  about going down rivers. He embodied a sacred rage, and an outrage. He  was completely politically incorrect, which I must say I fi nd very refresh- ing these days. And he wasn’t afraid of humor, and wicked humor. But  there was always this core that asked, “How do we live with wildness,  what do we do to maintain that, and what is acceptable and what is not.”  Ed was a man who knew it in his body, from the soles of his feet, liter- ally. I think we’re taught not to trust our own experience, and experience  is all we have. And if we fail to simplify, to spend time, to slow down,  then where does that leave us? We have no memory, and memory fuels  great actions. Memories of loss, memories of love, and memories of ac- tion can jar us out of complacency. I remember the last time I was with  Ed. We were hiking through Mill Creek Canyon, near Arches National  Park in Utah, and I said, “So Ed, what’s next?” And he said, “I’m think- ing of running for governor of Arizona.” And I said, “Oh really.” And he  said, “Yeah, I think the voter turnout has been a little bit too low in my  state.” I think it’s important for us to fi nd ways to jar each other out of  complacency and to think about how we can engage in this revolution,  this evolution of the spirit. Octavio Paz says that it requires both love and  criticism. I think that is powerfully rendered in Edward Abbey’s work.  jt: Let’s talk about storytelling. You had a wonderful natural occurrence in  your life where rocks spoke to you. In fact, you call her “Stone Woman.”  Can you tell us a little bit about that experience? ttw: I think I was on an extreme hallucinogenic. Not really; in Mormon cul- ture you’re allowed to have visions. This happened on a trip that Brooke  and I took in to the Grand Canyon, and there is an extraordinary waterfall  3. An Unspoken Hunger: Stories from the Field (New York, Pantheon, 1994), 58-59. 30 </page> <page sequence="11"> Wild Heart at Stone Creek. I remember walking up to this place, and it wasn’t a wa- terfall, Justine—I saw this Stone Creek Woman. And she was so clear to  me, and so present to me, that I just sat at her feet. And I think about her  at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, relegating the Colorado River. And  sometimes she is full, and sometimes she is dry.  jt: When you mention her, I think of the Great Mother—an image of some- thing we can hold that is there and here. She appears in the rocks, and the  rocks become alive. Then, with the rocks and the moss and the breathing  through the seasons, there is a peace there that is made alive. ttw: And again, it’s letting our boundaries dissolve so that anything is possible. jt: Would you mind doing another reading? ttw: An Unspoken Hunger [reading]: It is an unspoken hunger we defl ect between knives—one avocado between us,  cut neatly in half, twisted then separated from the large wooden pit. With the  green fl eshy boats in hand, we slice vertical strips from one end to the other.  Vegetable planks. We smother the avocado with salsa, hot chilies at noon in  the desert. We look at each other and smile, eating avocados with sharp silver  blades, risking the blood of our tongues repeatedly.4  jt: That really is connecting us with everything. When do we slow down to have  that kind of experience? That’s available, just eating. It’s so sensual, such an  erotic act. And it’s just totally being human. It even reminds me of what you  read earlier, about the bear, bringing out the calf and feeding her young. ttw: We are capable of both of these responses: to love, in terms of the bear,  and the elk calf, the elk mother watching the sow devour her calf; eat- ing avocados in the desert, risking the blood of our tongues repeatedly.  It’s life, and it is deeply sensual and deeply erotic. And again, how do we  separate? Why would we separate ourselves from the land, from the food,  from the body, from blood, from our voice? It’s how the poetics of place  translates to a politics of place, to an erotics of place.  jt: Go back. The poetics of place to the politics of place—help us make that  bridge. ttw: I think it’s where we began our conversation, Justine, with the naming of  things: pink murex, melongena, cowry—the shells that suddenly we see in  context of a beach, in context of a place, in context of a people holding those  shells, digging for clams, eating them, the nourishment of our body. And  4. Unspoken Hunger, 79. 31 </page> <page sequence="12"> A Voice in the Wilderness what happens when that becomes out of balance? What happens when the  beaches no longer support those shells, those creatures? What happens when  the oil slicks from the Exxon Valdez make impossible that connection be- tween place, creature, and community? I think that the naming of things, the  poetics of place, the passion that we feel, is naturally translated to a politics  of place—standing our ground in the places we love. And that, too, is sen- sual because it is about passion, and we are so fearful and frightened of that.  Audrey Lord says that we have been raised to fear the “yes” within ourselves.  And then we go back full circle to the fact that our lack of intimacy with the  land has initiated a lack of intimacy with each other. It’s this whole spiral,  circle, connectedness of how we live our lives. It’s what Abbey was saying. jt: What about the seasons? You also talk about the connection with the  larger picture, too, of the seasons, of the year as it moves around. Maybe  that’s something that you could tell us about. I know that you said that  you take time out in the darker months of the year, but how can we be  better with the seasons? ttw: I only need a quote from DH Lawrence’s poem, “The Old Church Knew,”  talking about “blood knowledge”: Oh, what a catastrophe for man when he cut himself off from the rhythm of the year, from his union with the sun and the earth. Oh, what a catastrophe, what a maiming of love when it was a personal, merely personal feeling, taken away from the rising and setting of the sun, and cut off from the magic connection of the solstice and the equinox! This is what is the matter with us. We are bleeding at the roots.5  The land is love. Love is what we fear. To disengage from the earth is our  own oppression. I really believe that, Justine. jt: Those are really powerful words: “to disengage from the earth is our own  oppression.” Tell us your own experience of that. ttw: If we lose our connection to landscape—if we forget where the source of  our power lies—a real power, not power in Washington, not power based  5. Lawrence’s “poem” here is actually a prose excerpt from his essay A Propos of Lady  Chatterly’s Lovers, (London: Mandrake Press, 1930). 32 </page> <page sequence="13"> Wild Heart on oppression, but power derived from an authentic life, from a life in  balance, from a life of beauty, awe, integrity, compassion, empathy, then  how can we know liberty? How can we know the truth of our souls? How  can we know other?  jt: And that is something that you don’t have to have an education to do, you  don’t have to have money to do—it’s a quality that you’re talking about, a  quality that’s available to all of us. ttw: Yes. And I think this is the unspoken hunger. This is our desire, our yearn- ing, our longing to connect with some place, some one, some thing other,  outside, beyond ourselves. jt: And how do we reach out and do that? ttw: I don’t know, but I fantasize. I think about what would happen if we took  an act like the Homestead Act, where everyone had a 160 acre parcel that  they fostered—what would happen if we turned that inside out and cre- ated the Homestand Act, where as a people in this country, we literally  stood our ground, and we really thought about the whole idea of home  rule. That we did, in fact, extend our notion of community to include all  life forms. And that we began to engage in this politics of place born out  of compassion, a deep love, and a deep sense of rootedness.  jt: Oh, you have to tell us about the wild cards. ttw: Well, this was something that we were thinking about as a group of wom- en: what would happen if, as women, as human beings, as members of this  nation, if we were to create a deck of wild cards. And if we saw a landscape  that was degraded, we would lay down our card to say, “This is inappro- priate.” If we saw an act in Congress that we disagreed with, we would  absolutely fl ood the desks of our representatives and senators with the  wild cards. If we were at a board meeting, and we saw oppression, if we  saw inappropriate policy, we would lay all of our cards on the table, wild  cards, saying that the games of women are not the games of men. I would  love to see this kind of action that is based both in humor and playfulness  as well as a fi erceness—a force to be reckoned with. jt: May it be so.
