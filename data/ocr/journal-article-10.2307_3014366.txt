But the word has this obvious defect to us-that it has become the designation of a peculiar modern sect, who, indeed, hold extreme spiritualistic doctrines, but who cannot be taken as typical of the theory of spiritualism among mankiind at large. It may therefore be found convenient to use for the belief in spiritual beings the not unknown term of Animism. This animism is, in fact, the groundwork of the philosophy of religion at large, from the religion of savagery to that of civilized life. It -may be taken as the minimum definition of religion, in an- swering the often repeated question, "Have such and such a tribe a religion ? " If they are animists, we may say "Yes." And though this definition of minimum religion may seem bare and meagre, it will be found practically to carry more than at first appears. For, first, he who believes in spiritual beings will generally be found to believe them active as to his own life here and hereafter; and secolndly, he who believes in such active spirits will generally put himself into intercourse with them, seeking to propitiate them, and thus will arise some form of prayer and worship. Here arises a profoundly interesting question, " Are there, or have there been human tribes so low in culture as to have no religious conceptions whatever?" This is an old question, and has been affirmed and denied for thousands of years with a con- fidence that may seem surprising to us, who see on what imper- fect evidence both affirmationi and denial were based. Ethlnographers, if looking to a theory of development to ex- plain civilization, regarding its successive stages as rising from low grades upwards, would receive with great interest accounts of tribes devoid of all religion. Here, they will naturally say, are tribes of men who have no religion because their forefathers never had any. They represent a prereligious stage of the human race, above which, in the course of ages, religious stages have risen; but, though in general advocating a development- theory of culture, I am unable to start a theory of animism from this prereligious condition. The niche is ready, but there is a difficulty about the statue to place in it. I fail to find the existence of tribes in this state proved by sufficient evidence. Assertions of tribes said to have no religion, but who prove, on closer examination, to bave a good deal, and of others whose reli- gious condition is obscure, may be had in abundance, but will not serve our purpose. What is wanted is a declaration by observers intimately acquainted with the language of the tribe, and also intimate enough to gain confidence on a subject on which savages are less apt to be confidential than any other. The savage's poor shy gods hide in holes and corners before the white man's mightier Deity. Now it is not denied in the abstract that</page><page sequence="3">among the Lower Races of Mankind. 371 prereligious tribes may have existed or may still exist; but I am bound to say that, if they exist, they must be found among extinct ancient tribes or imperfectly described modern ones. Where low tribes have been fully examined, they have been found to be animists; and their animism, or spiritualistic philo- sophy, is the subject of the present remarks. I may hint at the connexion of savage animism with its development among higher races; but my especial object is to describe it particularly so far as it constitutes a philosophic system of nature. This I shall do in a very rough and simple way, seeking only to delineate as clearly as I am able its main outlines. Animism divides roughly into two great divisions: (1) souls; (2) other spirits. It is proper to place souls first; for the conception by the lower races of the human soul seems to be that on which they formed and modelled their general idea of spirits. The savage mind appears to have been especially struck by two groups of phenomena, which they endeavoured to account for on a scientific theory. (A.) That which constitutes the difference between a living and a dead body:-the fading of light from the glazed eyes, the cessation of breath, the stoppage of pulsation, the loss of con- sciousness and voluntary movement-in a word, of the pheno- mena classed together under the heading " Life." These they especially associated with the breath, how naturally we may judge from the story of the deaf, dumb, and blind Laura Bridg- man's dream, which she described by the gesture of taking something from her lips, explaining in words, "'I dreamed God took up my breath to heaven." The languages of the world will express this deep-lying connexion in the many cases where the word breath has come to denote life or soul; from the Austra- lian waug and the Malay fiawa, to the Semitic nephesh and the Indo-European pneuma, aninma, ghost, &amp;c. (B.) The phantom copy of man seen in dreams and visions, apparently thin enough to flit through space and permeate solid nature, and to evade the dreamer's waking grasp. This is espe- cially and naturally associated with the shadow, an association also well expressed in languages, from the Ojibwa otahchuk to the Indo-European skia, umbra, shade. Now the savage to a remarkable extent connects these two conceptions into what may be called an apparitional soul, a ghost-soul. He considers that what causes death and what causes visions and dreams are one and the same. There are some who try to separate them, as the Greenlanders and Fijians; but the generally received connexion of the life with the phantom into a soul-ghost is the very key to savage psychology. 2 B 2</page><page sequence="4">372 E. B. TYLOR-The Philosophy of Religion Thus the Nicaraguans held that when a man dies, there comes out of his mouth something resembling a person, which is the life, and which departs to where the man is; but the body re- mains here. Parallel to this is the African conception of the man's shadow seized by a monster, whereupon the man after- wards dies-a story which appears to give the fundamental idea of the well-known European folk-lore tales of shadowless men. The soul-ghost appears in dreams and visions. Live men's souls may do this, as when a Fijian's soul goes out in sleep, and troubles other people. But especially the souls of the dead are supposed to do this. Thus Wilson says of the negroes that their dreams are visits from souls of deceased friends, and that the habit of talking dreams over makes them dream the more, till they have almost as much intercourse with the dead in sleep as with the living in waking, and can hardly distinguish dream from fact. A familiar classic instance is when the soul of Pa- troklos stands by Achilles, like in stature and the beauteous eyes, and the voice and garments; Achilles tries to grasp it with loving hands, but cannot catch it, and like a smoke the soul is borne away. The shade-soul appears as a ghost in the philoso- phy alike of the North-American Indian, the African negro, and the European peasant. For obvious reasons, the idea appears in savage psychology that the soul is sometimes visible and sometimes invisible. This explains the fact of only one seeing it at once, though we account for this in a different way by the theory of the subjec- tivity of visions. This is unknown to the savage, who (these Africans may serve as a type) is a man who scarcely distin- guishes his subjectivity from objectivity, hardly knows his inside from his outside. The animistic theory, as it explains death, so among many races explains sleep, and with this dreaming works in, as when the Greenlander lies insensible while his soul goes out hunting and visiting. The Karens cleverly account for the fact of our seeing known places in dreams, by saying that the leip-pya can only find the way where it has been before in life. It explainis coma, where the body lies senseless while the mind wakes with new experiences, as when Australian or Khond sorcerers go out of their bodies for spirit-knowledge, or where in the Vatns-doela Saga, the Finns sent to visit Iceland lie rigid while their souls go out on the errand and return with information. Of classic tales appropriate to these things, is the story of Hermotimos, whose body his wife burnt while his soul was gone out in search of spiritual knowledge. It explains sick-ness, as when the Karens call back the kelah of a sick man, and the sick Fijian may be heard bawling for his own soul to come back.</page><page sequence="5">among the Lower Races of Mankind. 373 Thus we see what a whole theory of savage biology is here, which explains life and death, sleep and waking, swoons and illness, dreams and visions. It is partly retained in modern psychology; but we should find among modern peasants that a much more nearly savage state is retained. When the body dies, the soul departs to its place. Not con- tent with this, the lower races assist nature, and, when a warrior or chief dies, despatch wives and slaves, whose souls are to con- tinue their earthly relations. Thus the Fijian and African are buried with wives, slaves, &amp;c., the custom extending upward into the Hindu sati, &amp;c. That animals, "our younger brothers," as the North-Ame- rican Indian calls them, have souls like men is an obvious in- ference to the lower races, and has continued to some extent into modern speculative philosophy. Therefore animals also are sacrificed for the dead; the horse for the Red Indian, the dog for the Aztec and Greenlander, the camel for the Beduin. Lastly, not only men and animals have souls, but in savage philosophy things also, which at any rate are seen in dream and vision. This doctrine is distinctly believed among the Algon- quinas, Fijians, and Karens. All these send objects for the. use of the dead on his journey; and though among most savage and higher races no such theory is stated, yet we find it considered that the objects are for use, and will pass into the possession of the deceased. Thus in Madagascar, Radama was seen riding the horse and dressed in the uniform buried with him; the Caribs destroy slaves, dogs, and weapons; the Guinea negroes offer wives, slaves, property, gold fetishes, &amp;c. for use in the other world. In Modern Asia, the Kirghis kill horses, gold is offered and implements of craft-much as the old Scythian in funerals sacrificed wife and servants, gold vessels, &amp;c. The importance of this point consists in its being a test whether savage philosophy dwindles into survival, or whether, on the other theory, we are to suppose that nonsense is degraded into sense. As regards the details of the doctrine of a future life among the lower races, no immortality is recognized; the soul is ethereal and surviving, not immaterial and immortal. It carries on a mere continued existence, as shown by dreams and visions. The descriptions of future existence current among the lower races are not limited to a single theory, but include every idea likely to occur to them. The conception may be roughly divided as follows: 1st. The doctrine of the ghost hovering or wandering on earth, or coming back occasionally to visit its former home, is</page><page sequence="6">374 E. B. TYLOR-On the Philosophy of Religion displayed among mankind from savagery upwards, especially causing the prevalent fear of graves and the practice of offering food for the dead usual amongst most savage races, lasting on among such nations as the ancient Romans and modern Chinese, and even now surviving in form in the Eastern Church. 2nd. The doctrine of Metempsychosis. The transmigration of souls of the dead into other human beings is well marked among the Greenlanders, where widows will make it a plea for the adoption of an orphan child by some rich man, declaring it to have received the soul of some one of his family-or among tribes of Nutka Sound, who account for the existence of a dis- tant tribe speaking the same language by supposing them ani- mated by the souls of their own dead. In Africa the dead are buried near the living, that their souls may enter new-born children. The indigenes of Africa, America, and Asia account in this way for likeness to deceased relatives, and look for personal likeness and marks of ancestors on new-born infants. The belief in transmigration into animals is well marked among the lower races, as in Greenland, where a man will avoid a particular animal as food on the score of a deceased kinsman having passed into such-among the Icannas of Brazil, who ima- gine that brave warriors become beautiful birds, and cowards reptiles-or the Zulus, who believe that certain harmless com- mon house-snakes are animated by the souls of deceased kindred. The general transmigration-theory takes especially its moral bearing in India, where Brahmins and Buddhists, " bound in chains of deeds," and " eating fruit of past actions," migrate into " gods, ascetics, brahmins, nymphs, kings, counsellors, birds, dancers, cheats, elephants, horses, sudras, barbarians, wild beasts, snakes, worms, insects, and inert things." The classical instances, especially Pythagorean and Platonic, are well known; and the doctrine survived into modern Europe, though now fallen into contempt. 3rd. The doctrine of the residence of departed souls in another world. The conceptions of this spirit-world among the lower and higher races are various, and we have not a key for their full understanding; but it may be observed that the next world has been located in every place which was likely to occur to the minds of savage tribes. One thought is very prevalent in these conceptions-that of taking the sun-myth as a type of the destiny of man, and placing the land of the dead in the region of the sunset. Examples of the localization of the land of the dead may be given. (1) The happy Western Islands, as to which the mythology of the modern Australians and Fijians agrees with that of the ancient Greeks: we ourselves dwell in these islands of the blessed; for such Britain seemed to the continental</page><page sequence="7">among the Lower Races of Mankind. 375 nations of Europe. (2) The under-world of the Kamchadal, whither the sun descends at night, and where souls of men and animals descend; the subterranean caverns, where the Patagonian looks forward to a new life of perpetual drunken- ness; and so on, to the Sheol of the Jews and the Hades of the Greeks. (3) The abode of Heaven, whither the Winnebagos travel by the MilkyWay; the Path of the Dead, or where Tamoi, the Ancient of Heaven, awaits the Guarayos of Brazil; and so onward to the familiar conceptions of a Paradise in the skies. With regard to the admission of the dead to these regions of new life, two theories especially prevail in the world-one which may be called the continuance-theory, the other the retribution- theory. The first, which regards the new life as but a renewal of the old, perhaps dull and shadowy, perhaps bright and happy, is habitual among the lower races, and extends on to the level of Greeks and Israelites. The influence on morals of the belief in a future existence mainly depends on the retribution-theory, which expects in the -next world reward and punishment for works done in this. With regard to the grounds on which the lower races accept the doctrine of the future life, it has to be borne in mind that any views which have become current are supported by the evi- dence of dreams and visions. The North-American Indian, who in a trance visits the happy plains of the dead and sees the souls carrying the phantoms of guns and kettles -sacrificed to their manes, and the Zulu, who has followed a porcupine into a hole in the ground and gone down to the under-world, where Zulu souls have their huts and cattle as on earth, are among the scores of types which among the lower races show the habit of visions of a future life-which extend, with properly varied details, to the Greek and Hindu visits to the judgment-halls of Minos and Yama, and the visits to the abode of the dead from the entrance to St. Patrick's purgatory. In completing the classification of orders of the spiritual world as recognized by the lower culture, an important group has to be noticed as intermediate between mere souls in their ordinary function and superhuman demons or deities. This class is that of manes, souls in origin, but demons or deities in quality. They thus form an instructive transitional series, favouring the opinion that spirits in general are modelled on human souls. Manes-worship is strong among savage races. The Polynesian and South African propitiate them as the great causes of good and evil to man. West-African negroes and indigenes of Bri- tish India alike keep up their ancient cultus, which reaches its</page><page sequence="8">376 E. B. TYLOR-On the Philosophy of Religion height in the ancestor-worship which is the essential religion of China, and survives in fragmentary relics among cultured nations. Next, as to the functions which spirits are considered to per- form, and the phenomena which make a belief in them a neces- sary part of barbaric philosophy. As soul enters into body and agitates and works it, so spirit, which may be soul, enters and causes a wonderful group of phenomena when man, with changed face and voice under violent excitement, bursts out into floods of eloquence unknown in his ordinary state, into expressions of wisdom and mystery beyond his daily powers. Patagonian epileptics selected as conjurors druim themselves into fits; so Veddahs and Bodo work themselves into fits to give information for the cure of patients. The Fijian gazes at a whale's tooth, twitches and is convulsed; his veins swell, his eyes roll, sweat pours down his limbs, his face is pale with livid lips, his breathing stertorous: now he is possessed, and no longer a voluntary agent; he gives answers, flings himself down, and says, "I depart," then has his dinner and comforts himself with a pipe. Such a Polynesian could have looked on at Delphi, and watched and listened to the Pythoness with no surprise at proceedings so congruous with his ordinary notions. As a human soul goes into its body, so other vital phenomena are accounted for by the entrance of spirits; and thus we have the great theory of disease,possession, Even the Tasmanians and Polynesians can feel demons knotting and twisting in their in- side; and the Mintira have a hantu for each disease. Especially certain peculiar diseases are so explained -,epilepsy, delirium, hysteria, mania, &amp;c. The East Africans simply explain madness and idiocy by saying, " He has fiends." In South Africa deli- rium or fits are supposed to be caused by possession by a ghost; for here still the analogy is kept up, and the disease..spirit is not only like a human soul, but may be one, So in British India &amp;c. the phenomena of demoniacal possession, raving, convulsions, breaking cords, speaking strange things in the namue of the demon they suppose inside themr, may still be seen as of old, and the exorcist's profession thrives. We find comparatively little of it except in heathen countries; for the influence of Christianity has for centuries been turned to superseding it by civilized medicine. The disease-spirit has to be got out or away from the patient by the savage exorciser; and sometimes he only drives it away as people hunt away a haunting ghost, But here, again, some- times the typical analogy of the human soul comes into play. To get rid of this spirit they seem to say, let us get it a new</page><page sequence="9">among the Lower Races of Mllankind. 377 body to enter or pervade. Burton describes the Central African habit of transferring diseases into bits of stick or rag, &amp;c., which form what is called the keti or stool on which the noxious influ- ence sits; and it is got rid of by hanging it to a sacred tree-a practice which, apparently in part for the same reason, prevails in Europe, and is not forgotten in Ireland. Modern folk-lore keeps up the idea of transferring disease into objects such as flowers, coins, &amp;c., which are given to others or left for them to find. As the soul may be in or out of the human body, so other spirits are held to exist free or to become embodied. Thus the South-American Indians' rattles, possessed by spirits, can receive offerings and utter oracles. Mr. Darwin saw a dressed-up wooden spoon become lunatically possessed, and dance in the hands of the women holding it. Objects thus possessed or inhabited by a spirit maybe conve- niently defined as fetishes; and the word fetishism, brought into use by De Brosses and adopted by Comte, may be better limited to this more special meaning than allowed to cover the whole range of animistic belief and worship. To fetishism idolatry belongs in great measure in principle. Stocks and stones set up by savage races, and identified with ancestors or deities, form the lowest variqty of idols. Polyne- sian rude images, held to be receptacles inhabited at times by the spiritual beings which go in and out of them, display the principle of the fetish and idol most perfectly. Onward in culture, the idol is either thus a receptacle for the deity, a habita- tion for him as the human body is for the soul, or it passes into a purely symbolic connexion with the god it represents. Among the lower races, the possession of spirits enables the medium or priest to give oracles, speaking by his voice or guiding his diviniDg instrument, and their power enables him to perform what are considered superhuman feats. This kind of spiritual action, which may be traced from the lowest savagery onwards throughthe whole course of civilization, is in our own timerenewed with extreme vigour in the ascription to spiritual influence of the sounds of table-rapping, the action of the hand using the spirit-pen, &amp;c. Spiritual beings hold in the lower philosophy a position im- mensely more important than this. The philosophy of the savage recognizes a countless host of spirits pervading all nature. To the Australian all his world swarms with spirits; and it is a dismal symptom of the unhappiness of his condition that he regards them as generally ill-disposed to the poor black fellow. To the Khond of Orissa every rock and hill is inhabited and every action of nature presided over by appropriate spiritual beings.</page><page sequence="10">378 E. B. TYLOR-0U the Philosophy of Religion It has been well said of the Polynesians by Ellis, that they hold the doctrine expressed in Milton's lines- "Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth, Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep." And from this level the doctrine of nature-pervading spirits extends fully into mediaeval European culture, and thence holds on to no small extent in survival. What are these spirits for? If it be true, as the poet sings, "Felix qui potuit rerutn cognoscere causas," then the savage should be happy, for here he at least thinks he has grasped the causes of things. To hiim all is the immediate work of personal spirits. We have seen that life and death and dreams and disease have spirits for causes, and so, to the savage mind, nature throughout is animated nature. As theAbbe Raynal says, where there is motion, there the savage supposes a soul. What gives some men knowledge and power sometimes, or takes it away? What makes strange noises in the hut? What pushes the North-American Indian into the fire? What pulls him under water? What drives the fat deer some days into his path, and some days gives none? Do not go under that tree, the fever demon is sitting upon the branches ready to pounce upon you. Will you cross the lake? Pray, and offer to its Manitu. From the tiniest elf in the long grass to the Gitchi Manitu, all spirits are causes. The hamadryad of the tree grows with it, and dies when it falls, " Non sine hamadryadis fato." Every group of trees, every grove has its presidi-ng genius. Wells, waterfalls, rocks have their superintending spirits; and over these reigns the higher Spirit of the Forest, the Water, &amp;c. Species and tribes, animal and human, have presiding genii. Whatever we may judge of the savage belief in spirits, we are not to call it a pur- poseless fancy; for these beings have full office to perform in being, as it were, the souls of natural objects in carrying on their operations. Phenomena which the savage referred to the action of personal spirits, civilized peoples explain by theories of another sort; but we are not to misunderstand the reasonable, purposeful inference by which men in the lower culture used the theory of animism to serve them as a philosophy of nature. In conclusion, as to the higher deities of Polytheism. Above the inferior divinities of nature there reign the great nature- gods, whose sway extends not over this or that district, but over the world at large-Sun and Moon, Heaven and Earth and Sea, the Thunder-god, the Storm-god. Evil deities are often more propitiated than good, as the savage seeks rather to appease his enemy than please his friend; and early in savage culture ap-</page><page sequence="11">among the Lower Races of Mankind. 379 pears that Dualism which divides spiritual beings into good and evil, i. e. friendly and hostile, each company led by a great deity. And sometimes a deity is erected into supremacy. Thus over the polytheistic system of nature-gods reigns the Peruvian Sun- god; the Heaven-god is the Chinese Tien or the Greek Zeus. Even the system of the manes-worshippers admits of a primeval ancestor obtaining the divine supremacy, like the Unkulunkulu, the Old-old-one of the Zulus. It has thus been attempted to set forth very briefly the out- lines of the lower animism. The theory of its development may be thus recapitulated: Man's earliest and primitive conception of a spiritual being may well have been that of his own human soul, the idea of which served to explain many of the great phe- nomena of his own existence-life, death, sleep, dreams, visions, ecstasy, disease. Then he may have extended this conception to souls of animals, trees, even lifeless objects. Then looking to the analogy of his own human life to explain the action of Nature at large, he attributed to other spiritual beings, bearing strong likeness in form and character to the souls, the existence and growth of a nature which to him was indeed " animated nature" in a sense far beyond ours. These spiritual beings are of many orders, from low elves up to great fetish deities like Heaven or Sun; and the Polytheism of low races even shows traces of approach to the supremacy of one great deity, and thus faintly foreshadows the coming Monotheism. But throughout his hierarchy the human conception served as his model of the divine. This may be called the natural theology of the lower races. It is true that it differs a good deal from the natural theology of which we read in books. But then we must remember that men like Paley and Butler drew their main ideas from races at a condition as high at least as the ancient Greeks. Ethnology was scarcely known to them, or appreciated by them. The great question for ethnographers is, Do these savage views represent remnant or rudiment? If they represent a rem- nant of broken down high culture, they are of comparatively little consequence. But if-and, it seems to me, the more we work at ethnography the more we shall admit this-if they represent human thought at a comparatively rudimentary stage, they become of immense practical interest. To understand the rude animism of the lower races, and to trace it onward as modi- fied from century to century to fit with more advanced intelli- gence, is indispensable to the full comprehension of not only the historical but the actual position of philosophy and theology.</page><page sequence="12">380 On Religion among the Lower Races of Mankind. DISCTSsION. Mr. IJoWORTH thanked the author for the new and suggestive manner in which he had treated a much-written about and apparently trite subject. In illustration of his remark, that the immolation of the widow on the pyre of her deceased husband is a very widespread custom, the speaker observed that he had met with a curious illustra- tion a short time ago in an essay by D'Ohsson, giving, from an Arabic traveller, an account of the funeral of a Nbrse chief, which he witnessed at Bolghara. The body was laid out in a ditch for ten days. Meanwhile the bark of the deceased was dragged ashore, a splendid tent of Roman cloth of gold erected on it, in which was put a couch, and on the couch the dead warrior in most sumptuous dress. His wives and slaves were now asked which of them would volunteer to die on the pyre. An old hag, called the Angel of Death, was mistress of the ceremonies. The volunteer, after drinking plenty of spirits and wailing a weird good-bye to her friends, was then strangled and placed alongside her dead husband. Two horses were then chased round till they were fagged and covered with sweat (apparently to make them easier to catch in the Happy Land); they were then killed, as were also two hounds and a cock and hen. The whole having been thrown on the pyre, fire was applied, and in the quaint language of the Arab, the deceased went straight to Heaven instead of passing through ignoble worms. This account has been confirmed to the letter by the Cossack explorations of graves at Novgorod. With Mr. Tylor's conclusions the speaker could not possibly agree. Comparative mythology, like comparative philology and even anatomy, cannot be safely treated empirically. The only scien- tific-method is the historic. We must trace up the history of known religions to their sources if we are to generalize on the source of all religions. If we approach our subject from this point, we shall find that MIr. Tylor's theory is untenable. He argues that polytheism is the earliest type of religion, and that polytheism is only a deve- lopment of manes or ancestral worship, and was in its origin invari- ably anthropomorphic. Now among the Norsemen and the Greeks we can actually trace the first introduction of manes-worship at a very secondary state of religious development. The demigods of the Greeks, like Odin and his Asirs among the Norsemen, formed no part of their original mythology, which was in both cases that of superhuman deities. If we examine religions nearer home, in Italy and Portugal for instance, we shall find that an immature form of polytheism has developed itself from a monotheistic religion, The army of saints, whose cultus is more popular than and even hides that of the Deity himself, is but an everyday type of the growth of polytheism. If we examine the earliest records we possess, the in- scriptions of Mesopotamia, we shall find a more reasonable theory for the growth of polytheism. Each town and little community has its separate god, and only one god, the God of the Hebrews, of the Hittites, &amp;c. When several of these communities were joined into</page><page sequence="13">Discussion. 381 one state, the latter adopted these national gods (originally the same god), and thus formed a Pantheon. Fetishism is the natural growth of pantheism. The universally present god is easily translated by the savage mind into a substan- tive god in each material object. This growth we may also trace in better known mythologies; spirits of woods and brooks and hills are only disintegrated portions of the one underlying spirit. Mr. Howorth held that the historic testimony proved that the simplest and earliest form of religion is monotheism, from which the various faiths of savages have grown-luxuriantly grown very often; and where we see the introduction of a monotheistic creed among a polytheistic race, it is only another instance of the philo- sophy of the more cultured human mind reverting to its original and most ancient creed. Mr. HYDE CLARKE called attention to the phenomena connected with the comparative psychology of the subject-the animistic ten- dencies of animals. Those who have experience of the domestic animals know that they have superstitions like ourselves. The dog or the horse is affected by the same strange appearances as is the man, and has the like dread of ghosts arnd spirits. It might be asked how a,nimals obtained these ideas; but Mr. Tylor had afforded a clue by his reference to the experience of man in dreams as to phantoms and creatures of a disturbed imagination. The mind of a dog being constituted like that of a man, he has, there can be no reasonable doubt, the same p?henomena of dreaming, and in the disordered condition of the senses at the moment of waking would see distorted images, which are treated as actual experiences. In this way he accounted for the growth of superstition in animals, although they have no means of intercommunication, except by the propagation of fear at the sight of some object of alarm. With regard to the doctrine of the transmigration of the souls of ancestors to children, he would suggest that it may be partly due to the natural phenomena of atavism. Where it has been observed that a child inherits the likeness or qualities of a grandparent (those of the grandsire), it was easy to suppose that he has inherited the soul. Mr. Tylor's doctrine of the influence of the dual idea of good and evil in animistic developments should be extended to the influence of the dual sexual idea, as more notably in its application to the sun and moon and the nature-gods. Mr. TYLOR, in a brief reply, called attention to the citation by Jacob Grimm (in his ' Verbrennen der Leichen ') of the remarkable Slavonic wife-sacrifice noticed by Mr. Howorth. With regard to the argument for monotheism as the original doctrine of mankind, Mr. Tylor pointed out that the course theology has taken in the world is indicated by the fact that the religions of savage races afford explanations of otherwise obscure beliefs and rites of the civilized world, and not vice versd; so that it is rather in the doctrines of low tribes than among high nations that original theological conditions are to be sought.</page></plain_text>
