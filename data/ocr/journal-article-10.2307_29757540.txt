<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reutilization of Old Images for New Iconographic Generations The Question of the Destiny of Greek Images in the Post-Hellenistic Period by Kazim Abdullaev The cultural interaction between Greece and the Ancient Orient is one of the most interesting and sophisticated problems in ancient history - and every new archaeological discovery brings with it a new aspect of this phenomenon. The well known artistic images imported into Central Asia have their own history of development. Sometimes it is hard to recognise through many new details the original meaning and iconography of the image. Let us take as an example the representation of the most popular personage of Greek mythology, Hercules, in the Hellenistic and post-Hellenistic periods. We have three gradually degraded plastic images of this hero belonging to different times. The first of them was found in the Temple of the Oxus in Tadjikistan and was widely published in different editions (Picikjan 1991: 172-80, for the bibliography see p. 324). The hilt of a Greek dagger (xyphos) is decorated with the figures of Hercules and the river-god Acheloos (Fig. la). The representation was modelled in the best Hellenistic tradition of plastic art. The second object, which resembles the general schema of the composition from Takht-i Sangin, is a terracotta plaquette from Kara Picok (Vinogradova &amp; P'jankova 1977: 56-68, fig. 3). It shows an iconographic degradation and transformation of the details. Realism is completely lost in the manner of treatment. The body is shown out of proportion with the upper right hand which holds the club. The left hand seizes a warf s hair, who must correspond to the image of Acheloos (Fig. lb). On the terracotta figurines from Barat Tepa (Surkhandarya region of Uzbekistan) we can observe the next degradation in the iconography of this Greek personage (*). Although the position of the right hand is the same, the hero no i1) In the first publication of this figurine Pugacenkova (1973: 118, fig. 34) identified it as the Zokhak of Persian mythology. Later, in another article, it was interpreted as the Kara Pic ok figurine, in the Hercules image. See Abdullaev 1988. [1] 53</page><page sequence="2">^ ^ ^ ^^^^^^ c Fig. 1 - Hercules and Acheloos. a.

In his left hand however he holds an arrow, in place of the dwarf held by the figure from Kara Picok. However, the manner of modelling and certain elements are preserved in it (Fig. \c). It should be noted that on the Kara Picok figurine one finds elements that are quite foreign to the Hercules image. These consist of a crown and pendants which were characteristic in the art in the Iranian world (for example the Sassanian figurative complex, 3rd-4th century A.D. as dated by the Kara Picok representation). But in the art of small plastic forms there is evidence of the direct action of the craftsman who sometimes changed not only the details of the image but also the meaning. In the present article we describe types of terracotta figurines, mainly anthropomorphic in character, which were originally Greek and subsequently transformed in time. The transformed terracotta representation moved away from its original prototype in spite of artistic level of the sculptor or craftsman. The transformation of the original appearance of terracotta sculpture was executed in different ways. Here we describe the main ones. In the first one the badly obliterated parts of a sculpture were re-made after printing in a mould. The correction was executed in the damp clay with special instruments. This method was extremely laborious and working each specimen took considerable time. Although this method was not practical for mass production, we cannot exclude the possibility of its use. The second way is represented in the next action: after printing in worn out moulds the figurine was renovated and in this way recreated, and from used to create a new mould. So the new production with all the details and the craftsman's correction was used for multiple reproductions from this single mould. The chronological gap between the original object and the renovated one was often considerable. The third way of image transformation was to print only the head in the mould, whereas the other parts of the body were modelled by hand from one piece of clay. In this case the model for the mould of the head might not be only in terracotta. For example, a metal cast head or carved in bone, or stone etc., could serve very well for the creation of new moulds. The above-mentioned methods were the most popular and most evident in the technological examination of terracotta plastic objects. Every study of objects in their iconographic aspect demands a special approach and must take the historical and cultural context into consideration. The process of the transformation of an artistic image is very important, as it reflects on the one hand the world view and particularities of the craftsman, and on the other hand the cultic and mythological situation of the epoch and of the region. That is why both the artistic potential and the craftsman's level of understanding of myth, ritual and culture are of great significance. All iconographic changes occur over a definite period where the basic idea and the underlying understanding and symbolism pass harmoniously from one historical and cultural complex to the cultic and religious scheme of a new epoch with all the consequences that follow. For example, the images of the Dionysiac circle represented by remarkable objects of plastic art in the Hellenistic period continued [3] 55</page><page sequence="4">to develop during the Kushan period. The cultic representations corresponding to the most popular divinities preserved their character and functional particularities in spite of certain, and sometimes considerable, changes. We have chosen this series of images, clearly Greek in character, but some of which had changed so much that it is hard to compare them with the original. In the remodelling of details of original objects the latter to a certain extent loose their artistic value. The archaeological investigation of one of the most interesting sites of Hellenistic Bactria, Kampyr Tepa (Rtveladze 1977, 1984), affords an opportunity to gather a lot of archaeological finds from different categories, which reflect the ancient culture and art of this region. Amongst the finds of Kampyr Tepa there are a number of terracotta figurines representing impressive images of Greek character, that, at the same time, also present certain oriental features. The figurines are dated stratigraphically between the 3rd century B.C. and the 2nd century A.D., and allow to trace the development of plastic images from the original types to the transformed models of the subsequent period. The first terracotta representation is a bearded personage with a moulded head and a hand-made body sitting on a throne (the throne is without a back and more closely resembles a chair). Dimensions: 11.5 x 5 cm. The figurine was found 9 cm below the surface of a floor in an organic layer of green colour in dwelling no. 5 (prayer hall?) of the N-W block of complex 'Ya' of the cultic complex of the citadel. The first notable particularity of this figurine is the contrast between the clearly detailed head and the schematically modelled body. There are a number of articles devoted to the identification of this figurine (Nikonorov &amp; Savchuk 1992; Abdullaev 1998). This terracotta attracts attention because of the combination of techniques used in its creation. The rough modelled body has two rows of vertical incised lines and a relief on the chest: both of these elements indicate that the craftsman tried to portray the image of a warrior in armour. The head printed in a mould is that of a figure with a thick beard and moustache, the face framed by a finely curled beard (Fig. 2). The headdress is complemented with ear-flaps on both sides of the head and a tail at the back of head. The nose is large, with flared nostrils, the eyes are Europoid in shape. All these features suggest a link with bearded personages of Greek plastic art such as Hercules or the numerous images of Satyrs^ Two similar heads were found on the site of Zartepa (Abduilaev, Rtveladze &amp; Siskina 1991: 1195-96). The head from Kampyr Tepa is clearly Hellenistic in appearance, most likely corresponding to the Greek Hercules, who was so popular in the ancient art of Central Asia, particularly in Bactria. The figurine is dated to 2nd century B.C., a period of upheaval in the Graeco-Bactrian realm brought by the invasion of the Yueh Chih tribes. The appearance and details of this figurine resembles the personages of the Khalchayan figurative complex. Amongst them are warriors in armour fighting out against the Yueh Chih light cavalry. The stratigraphical context of this terracotta indicates that only a relatively short time had passed from the 56 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2 - Terracotta from Kampyr Tepa, house E, 11.5 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm. 2nd-lst century B.C. Fig. 3 - Terracotta from Kampyr Tepa. Satyr, 12.2 x 5.5 cm. lst-2nd century A.D. creation of the moulded head, which belongs to a Greek figurative complex, to the final period of Greek power (second part of 2nd century B.C.) and the subsequent hand modelling of the body. The primitive modelled figure of a Satyr comes from the same archaeological complex in the Kampyr Tepa citadel. The limbs are roughly modelled, with massive shafts for legs, and a thick tail (there are signs of chipping); the arms and hands are modelled in the same manner with the forearms and hands pressed to the chest (Fig. 3). The hands are treated as a solid mass of clay; two deep incised lines possibly represent the fingers. The right hand presses to the chest a long, unclear attribute, while the left hand clasps the upper part of this object. The attribute of his personage deserves special attention. It should be noted that, like the figure itself, the attribute is shown extremely schematically in the shape of a long shaft. It is posed vertically and the upper part is pressed to the chin. The excavator of this find describes it as a Vertical flute' (ibid.: 118, 1132). It is very possible that it is a flute, although it could also be a rhyton. In any case the schematic manner of modelling denies us any certainty about the character of this attribute. [5] 57</page><page sequence="6">The gracefully executed head is clearly distinguished in this otherwise rough work. Certainly it was made from a mould. The finely modelled features rank it with the best specimens of Greek plastic art. The short hair reveals a high forehead. The eyes are very expressive in spite of some defects and wear of the mould. The intensity of the eyes is highlighted by the modelling of the eyeball. The upward gazing eyes give the image the dramatic expression characteristic of Hellenistic plastic art. The brows join together on the bridge of the nose. The deep wrinkles continue down to the corners of the mouth. The head has a low cylindrically shaped hairdress. The contrast between the exalted face and the roughly modelled figure is striking. The craftsman who modelled this figure of a Satyr evidently did not appreciate the plastic niceties of the face and mechanically linked together incompatible details. Was this accidentally found head (or mould of the head) originally a warrior, a musician or a ruler? Whatever the answer in its second life it was transformed into an image that must have been a Satyr or another personage close to the Dionysiac circle. There is no doubt about this, because in the same archaeological context a similar, better preserved, statuette was found (ibid.: 117, 1131; dimensions 11.5 x 5-6.2 cm, Institute of Art, 1119/22). This figurine shows a complete image of a Satyr with sex organs modelled in a grotesque manner. It has a similar thick tail (most likely a horse's tail) which served also to support the figure on a flat surface. The head of the Satyr was modelled very summarily (Fig. 4). His projected nose is rendered by the 'pinch' technique, the eyes are drilled and the long wedge-shaped beard is divided in the middle by two oblique lines. The head is covered with a triangular-shaped cap, decorated with relief bands with incisions. As was mentioned, both figurines were found in the same conditions in the citadel of Kampyr Tepa and are dated to the late lst-early 2nd century A.D. If the Dionysiac images are relatively popular subjects in the plastic art of Bactria, the next statuette from Kampyr Tepa was uncommon for Bactrian artists. The terracotta composition presents two standing figures. The singularity of this terracotta includes a complex and uncommon attitude of the personages. This is the first time this pose is being found in the terracotta plastic art of Bactria. The right figure turns his nude back to the viewer (Fig. 5). The draped cloth partially covers the lower part of the legs, forming a large semicircular drapery. The left hand poses on the belly of the other figure standing beside it. The feet are schematically represented by two outward-turned pieces of clay. On the left 'foot' there are incised lines corresponding to toes. If the heads of the two figures are on the same horizontal line, the position of the right figure's foot gives the impression that they are poised in mid-air. The free space between the feet and pedestal testify to this. The head is turned towards the viewer. The left figure faces the viewer. He is draped in a long mantle, which uncovers the hips. Here the semicircular fold of the mantle is modelled in the same way, but hangs from the hip rather than on the lower part of the legs as in the figure on the 58 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 4 - Terracotta from Kampyr Tepa. Satyr, 12.2 x 5.5 cm. Late lst-early 2nd century A.D. Fig. 5 - Kampyr Tepa. Eros and Psyche. 1st century A.D. right. The right leg is bent and pushed forward. The space between the figures in the lower part is filled by lines of pleats. Under the semicircular drape there is a row of vertical pleats, evidently the drapery of a chiton. According to the form of the preserved relief, the hand of the left personage clasps an unclear attribute. The head of this personage is also turned towards the viewer and modelled in the same way. The features are terribly rough: the eyes are wide set, and stretch to the sides of the face. They are extremely large, with thick lower and upper eyelids. The mouth is also roughly modelled. The difference in the treatment of the eyes and mouth is that the eyeballs are shown in relief, whereas the mouth presents a deep furrow between the thick lips. The brows are shown in the shape of a horizontal band. The first noteworthy aspect of this terracotta representation is the combination of graceful figures with roughly and grotesquely modelled heads and limbs. Let us examine some particularities of this uncommon representation. It should be noted from the outset that there is no doubt that this is an amorous couple. If we focus on the details, we can observe the graceful curve of the back on the right hand [7] 59</page><page sequence="8">figure. It is emphasised by the light furrow of the spine, while the left arm is stretched out easily to the left side. But below the elbow it is transformed into a beast's paw with clumsily executed fingers. The feet of the figure are also badly deformed. The left figure with its right foot advanced is draped with a thin material with vertical pleats. These elements give a certain elegance to the figure and are in sharp contrast with the deformed features. This composition was interpreted by the excavator and in the first publication as a 'scene of Mithuna, which is characteristic for India and the Extreme Orient' {ibid.: 115, *127; dimensions 10 x 4.5 cm). Although some signs, for example, the hand resting on the belly, occur exclusively in the Indian iconography of this period, the representations of amorous couples - donors on temple reliefs - are distinguished by a rigorous frontality and a different position of the hands. But in Greek iconography the representation of Eros and Psyche offers close analogies with the Kampyr Tepa couple. So, for example the sculpture from the Capitol Museum in Rome (Charbonneaux, Martin &amp; Villard 1988: 316, fig. 347) has a number of common features. For example, the pose and the figure of Psyche draped in a thin material and modelled in a similar manner. Despite the fact that the figure of Eros is completely naked, these two subjects are very close to each other, especially if we consider that the Kampyr Tepa couple was originally a copy of another, similar, sculpture, but in an original Greek form. From its archaeological context the terracotta from Kampyr Tepa may be dated to the 1st century B.C., that is to say that both these objects of art are also chronologically close. It should be noted that the original variant of the Kampyr Tepa representation belongs to an earlier period. We have not taken into consideration one feature which is not important at first sight. It is the ornamentation of the pedestal which consists of a row of incisions framed by two lines. Similar ornaments but in a clearer form may be seen on the terracotta plaque with the representation of a warrior dated by the excavator to the 3rd-2nd centuries B.C. (Abdullaev, Rtveladze &amp; Siskina 1991: 114, 1125). If we accept this date the terracotta with the 'amorous couple' would have originally belonged to that period. So, the remodelling of the terracotta must be dated to the time between this period and the 1st century B.C., with a hypothetical preference for the later date. The next terracotta figurine, a Hercules' head in a lion's scalp, can be considered a rare find. It was found during excavations at Erkurgan (Kashkadarya region) area no. 13 (layer XII), in an ashy layer. Dimensions: h. 8.5 x 6.8 x 2.6 cm (Fig. 6.a). This terracotta is made in a fine, light brown clay. The surface is covered with a light yellow slip. On the back of the neck area there are two incised parallel lines. The head of the figurine was printed in a mould and the body modelled by hand. It resembles the rider figure, so well known in the terracotta art of Central Asia. From the point of view of its artistic treatment this specimen (considering only the moulded head) is less impressive than the figure of a bearded warrior from 60 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 6 - a. Erkurgan. Hercules's head in a lion's scalp (terracotta), 8.5 x 6.8 x 2.6 cm. 3rd-4th century A.D. b. Takht-i Sangin. Hercules's head in a lion's scalp (ivory). 3rd-2nd century B.C. Kampyr Tepa described above. But in spite of this, the face, with a weak schematization of the features, contrasts with the roughly modelled body and outstretched arms. In the lower part there are traces of two lost legs. The head as we said was made from a mould; the features are indistinct. Over the forehead and under the hair there is a horizontal line emphasising the edge of the headdress. It continues below, forming a definite right-angle. The brows are shown by a slightly projected wide relief. The eyes with swollen eyelids are closed. The nose has a triangular shape, with flaring nostrils. The mouth is small and firmly closed. The headdress, in spite of its indistinct details, is of particular interest. First, in the upper part over the forehead, there are two symmetrically placed round reliefs. Between them there is a small triangular element, representing the centre piece of skin between the nostrils. The headdress is further emphasised by the deep lines on the sides of the face. On the lower part of the cheeks there are two ledges. Broadly speaking, the headdress resembles a lion's scalp and the head wholly corresponds to the image of a young Hercules, i.e. without a beard. The ivory head of Hercules from Takht-i Sangin (Picikjan 1991: 183-89, fig. 32) represents the closest analogy to the Erkurgan terracotta figurine, but it is undoubtedly earlier in date. The author of the Takht-i Sangin find interpreted it as Alexander-Hercules (Fig. 6b). The image of Hercules was known on coins in the Greek world long before Alexander in the Classic and Late Classic periods (LIMC, Heracles: 739-40, nos. 126 127, 129-130, 133). The following are a few examples: a stater minted in Metapontum [9] 61</page><page sequence="10">which is dated c. 430 B.C. (Jenkins 1980: pi. 18; Noe 1984: 79, nos. 428-430); a tetradrachm from Kamarina dated to 425-405 B.C.; a diobol from Heracleia (Lucania), dated c. 432-380 B.C. These are but some examples testifying to the popularity of this Greek semigod not only in folk-art, but also in the official, art. In the Hellenistic period Alexander-Hercules became one of the most popular heroes not only in literary sources, glorifying the feats of Alexander the Great, but in the different genres of figurative art. So, if we take the period of ancient Rome, and the number of plastic images corresponding to representations of Hercules, it seems they reflect more or less the portrait features of Alexander (LIMC: 1174, 1179). The phenomena of merging the Hercules image with representations of Alexander had a very sophisticated character. It followed different methods in different regions of the Hellenistic world. That is why it is better to observe the development of the Alexander-Hercules image in a certain time and region, for example, in ancient Central Asian. In my opinion, the definite similarities between the Takht-i Sangin head with the image of Alexander cannot yet account for its identification with the image of Alexander-Hercules. In any case, it is a debatable question. The author of the find interpreted it as the total combination of the common signs which are characteristic for the wide circle of plastic images of the Hellenistic world. The foundation of portrait iconography created by outstanding Greek sculptors (Lysippus, Leochares, Euticrates, Euphranor) become almost banal, penetrating all categories of figurative art. However, it is necessary to consider the fact that the Hercules image has a long history of iconographic development in the art of ancient Greece. In the Hellenistic period the Alexander image merged with the image of his divine ancestor. The great military leader not only compares himself with Hercules, but tries even to surpass him. If not himself, at least his apologists try to symbolize this idea. Let us now turn to more convenient sources clearly reflecting the principal tendencies in the ideology and propaganda of the cults of Greek deities and deified kings. The Seleucids, as Alexander's successors, held his memory sacred. The first proof of this is given by the coins wearing the name of Alexander on the reverse, for example, those minted in Susa by Seleucus I. But this does not mean that the name has some relationship with the representation of the young Hercules depicted on the obverse of these coins. For example, on the reverse of the stater with the head of Athena, also minted at Susa, appears the legend ALEXANDROY BASILEQS (Newell 1978: 108). As for the 'massive brows' giving the face a dramatic expression (Picikjan 1991: 184), this sign is characteristic of many works of plastic art in the Hellenistic period (compare for example the images of the Pergamon Altar). They are characteristic to a certain extent of the image of Hercules himself, whose popularity had not waned at all in this period. The coin iconography of the Seleucids presents a remarkable example of a young Hercules with the lion's scalp (the mint of Seleucus at Susa, Antiochus III at Susa) 62 [10]</page><page sequence="11">(Newell 1978: pis. I-V, XIII.1-5, XXIII.1-5, 11-13, XXIV.2-5, XXVI.I-S, 10-13, XXVIII.1-2, 4, 13-14, XXXm.2-6, 9-13, 15-21, XXXN.3-16, XXXV. 1-3, 11-22, XXXVI.M1,13,16-18). However, there is no reason to consider this representation as a portrait of Alexander. The latter is depicted on the coins of Seleucid kings but wearing a headdress in the shape of an elephant scalp (ibid:, pis. XXII. 10-21, 14-19, XXXV.4-7). Therefore, insufficient evidence is so far available to relate the ivory head from Takht-i Sangin with the image of Alexander-Hercules. However, another iconographical document bears witness to the popularity of Hercules himself in the repertoire of the Bactrian craftsmen. This is clearly represented on the hilt of the dagger from Takht-i Sangin depicting the scene of a fight between Hercules and Acheloos (Picikjan 1991: 172-79, fig. 29). As observed above, this subject existed and developed, losing certain features and gaining new ones. It is quite possible that it changed also in meaning and was adapted by the local population to suit its own mythology and cults (2). We have already spoken about the renovation of old images by craftsmen. However this was not a unique case of 'correcting' the moulded image. In dating terracotta works it is important to take into consideration that the craftsman often had to correct and even renovate the original objects, worn out by frequent use. The terracotta plaque from Kampyr Tepa presents one such example (Antiquities of Southern Uzbekistan 1991: 292). On the surface of this plaque a female figure is presented in low relief. In her hands she holds attributes whose meaning is hard to understand. They are very worn out and the representation is indistinct (Fig. 7). In the author's opinion the relief represents a female holding the standing figure of a boy and a bird. Disregarding these details in their unclear state, the master craftsman richly decorated the representation with punch marks (made with a tube on the damp clay) and deeply incised lines. It should be noted, however, that he did not touch the above mentioned details, keeping them in an unclear form while the lines corresponding to the pleats were cut and decorated with the tube impressions. The ornamentation was executed after pressing the plaque in a mould. In this case one can note with certitude the reworking by the craftsman. One of the most widespread methods of decoration on early Kushan ceramics was the combination of incised lines with stamps of a tube. The layer where this terracotta plaque was found is dated to the 1st century B.C.-1st century A.D. (2) We are not concerned here with the question of the cult and iconography of Hercules in Central Asia, because it will be the subject of a special study Only the presence of Hercules on Kushan coins, particularly on Kanishka coins, should be noted. The other important evidence testifying to the popularity of this hero is the finding of a bronze statue at Seleucia on the Tigris. Two texts, engraved on the right and left hips in Greek and Parthian contain the name of Hercules and its Parthian equivalent Veretragn. From this fact one can draw one important inference, namely, that in the Iranian world Hercules finds his conformity with all consequences of the questions of the particularity of cult and iconography. There are a number of publications devoted to this significant find: Al-Salihi 1987: 159 67; Pennacchietti 1987: 169-85. See also for more detailed observation Bernard 1990: 3-68. [11] 63</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 7 - Kampyr Tepa. Female seated figure. 1st century B.C.-1st century A.D. Judging by the rough character of the relief it belongs very probably to this date and the chronological gap between the original creation of the representation and its subsequent decoration is not great and does not lie outside the indicated dates. The next figurine to be examined (Fig. 8) is a female figure from Kampyz Tepa in a chiton with a cup. It was found in the citadel, in the layer of the 1st century B.C.-1st century A.D. This subject most likely depicts one of the ritual scenes on the funerary reliefs of the Hellenistic Extreme Orient (Palmyra, Dura-Europos, Hatra etc.). Unfortunately the head of the personage is not well preserved. It comes on top of a long slender neck. The features are indistinct: judging from the contours it has a long oval form. The hair is short and includes one row of curls. The relief of the left arm is worn out and barely distinguishable; most likely it was held along the body. The right arm has a massive form. It is bent at the elbow and holds a cup of hemispheric form (a so called phiale). The costume is undoubtedly Greek in character, with long vertical pleats falling from the edge of the neck. The cut of the chiton at the neck has the form of an obtuse angle, formed by the gathering of material on the shoulders. Under the breast the chiton is fastened by a band. It is sleeveless, the left arm is naked and the hand is roughly modelled. 64 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Personages in chitons with bands fastened under the breast are very popular in the terracotta plastic art of Ai Khanum (Francfort 1984; Guillaumme &amp; Rougeulle 1987; Abdullaev 1996). According to its iconographic peculiarities one can date the figurine no later than 2nd century B.C. An absolutely analogous terracotta figurine, but with certain details changed, is found on a terracotta relief from Zar Tepa. This relief was found in the late Kushan layers (Dig. no. 6, dwelling 1, over the 1st floor) and is dated to the 3rd-4th A.D. (Fig. 9). The relief from Zar Tepa is better preserved than the Kampyr Tepa specimen and allows certain unclear details of the latter to be clarified. It should be noted that the relief itself had been previously pressed in a mould. This is evident in the contours of the figurine, squeezed onto the damp surface of the slab, and by the traces of smoothing out. The posture of the personage is similar to the Kampyr Tepa representation except in one detail - the angle of the bent arm formed at the elbow. However, this was dependent on adjustments Fig. 8 - Kampyr Tepa. Female figure with a cup, 8.4 x 5.2 cm. 1st century B.C.-1st century A.D. made by the craftsman. In this case the position of the cup compared to the other details is more important and it remained in its place. Under the breast, on the same the level as the cup, there is a relief line corresponding the band fastening the chiton. On the Zar Tepa relief the pleats are shown in another way. They are executed in the shape of rays, emanating from the round relief of each breast. Finally one essential detail should be noted that in this case we have a half-length representation. The lower part of it ends into a wide relief band, resembling a balustrade. Observing this fragment in detail, we find it is similar to the representations dating from the early antiquity of an arch surrounding the figure. On the left side the arch ends by forming a right angle which continues to the left. So in the whole composition there are two details which could influence the change of the character of the representation itself. The first is that the representation is half-length, limited by the horizontal relief band, which hypothetically one can consider as the parapet of a small balcony. Similar architectural details may be found in the Gandharan reliefs, where, under the arches of the balcony, single figures or couples are placed (Tissot 1985: 156, pi. 5.a, 5.a). For example, the relief in schist, kept in the British Museum (London, no. 1917-10 [13] 65</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 9 - Zar Tepa. Terracotta plaque. 3rd-4th century A.D. 9-8) (Tissot 1985: 176, pi. XII.l). The second detail is to the high arch of the vault which also conducts us to Gandharan art, where in the diversity of arch compositions one can find types similar to the Zar Tepa relief. So, for example, the pavilion represented on the schist relief from the Lahore Museum (Pakistan, no. 1135) (Tissot 1985: 158, pi. 111.6) is covered by an arch supported by columns with pseudo-corinthian capitals. The bases of the arch are transformed into the horizontal lines of the cornice. Its general scheme is repeated on the Zar Tepa composition in a simpler way. All the details observed above thus link the plaque from Zar Tepa with works of Gandharan art. The chronological limits of the Zar Tepa complex fully encompass the influence of Gandharan art on late ancient Bactria. These influences may be noted on the other objects of plastic art of Zar Tepa (Abdullaev &amp; Zav'jalov 1985: nn. 112, 118). Turning to the representation itself, it should be noted that in comparison with the Kampyr Tepa terracotta figurine the Zar Tepa specimen is better preserved in spite of the chronological gap. It may be considered to be in a good state if we ignore some deformations which occured during pressing the clay in the mould and certain indistinct details. These involve the cup; its existence may be guessed by the nature of the remains and by analogy with the Kampyr Tepa specimen. The second is the deformation of the left arm wich happened, immediately after pressing in the clay. It is quite possible that by the time of the last moulding operation it had already changed form. Of the preserved details the headdress and the costume of the personage are very important for us. Let us first examine the hair style. As on the figurine of Kampyr Tepa it is represented by a row of curls, evidently twisted on a band as is shown on the terracotta figurines from Ai Khanum and the sculptures of Khalchayan (Abdullaev 1996: fig. 2) (3). The head, with its wide neck and elongated face, is (3) It should be noted that this style of hair-dress can be traced also in the Khalchayan sculptures. Apparently this feature characterises one of the particularities of the Hellenistic plastic art which is reflected also in the Khalchayan figurative complex. See, for example, the female heads nos. 21-25, 30, 33 in Pugacenkova 1971. 66 [14]</page><page sequence="15">reminiscent, as we saw, of the funerary reliefs of Palmyra and other monuments from the Far East. This similarity increases with the treatment of the eyes, which are placed close to each other, and with finely elaborated eyelids on the elongated plump face, with the impassive expression so characteristic of the funerary plastic art of Palmyra. The closest analogies in this respect are, for example, the reliefs with funeral banquets from Palmyra (Amy &amp; Seyrig 1936: pis. XXXIX.2, XLVIII.I). In Pal myrian sculptures, however, there is one particularity which forces one to view the representations from Kampyr Tepa and Zar Tepa in a different light. This is the fact that all female images have a complex of ornaments including earrings, while on the figures mentioned above they are absent (4). The band fastened under the breast is characteristic of female costumes. Here we have some contradictory elements that make dif? ficult the identification of the image itself. Fig. 10 - Afrasiab. Male figure holding a rhyton or a musical instrument. 6th-7th century A.D. The attribution of the original variant of this terracotta representation to the Hellenistic period, when in figurative art the ornaments were not so popular as later on Gandharan and Parthian Hellenised art of the first centuries, is more acceptable. Above we have given only one example from Erkurgan showing the re-utilisation of moulds in later generations. However, it does not mean that in Sogdian terracotta plastic art this phenomena is less characteristic. Here we can give some examples that fully reflect this in Sogdian art. The first terracotta presents a roughly modelled figure from Afrasiab The left hand is preserved only in the shape of a twisted relief strip. The attribute closely resembles the above studied figure of a Satyr with moulded head from Kampyr Tepa. It is possible that it is a schematically treated rhyton or a musical instrument, because it is held close to the mouth (Fig. 10). In this figure, as on the above (4) In Gandharan art the earrings are typical of both female and male representations. It is typical of both cultic and secular works. (5) The terracotta belongs to the finds of the Afrasiab site, H-9,5 nm. It is dated to the 6th-7th century A.D. and kept in the collection of the Institute of Archaeology (Samarkand). [15] 67</page><page sequence="16">observed specimens, the well modelled head (finely worked eyes with eyelids and smiling mouth) is combined with a roughly modelled body. This head closely resembles another terracotta figurine from Samarkand, published by G.A. Pugachenkova and L.I. Rempel (Pugacenkova &amp; Rempel 1965: fig. 143). The authors dated it to 6th-7th century A.D. and interpreted it as a male statuette of the 'Apollo' type. Both heads are covered with a headdress - a cap of conical shape. Long curly hair falls down on the shoulders. The mouth is slightly open. The eyes and brows are treated in a similar manner. The long and elegantly modelled neck is connected with a shapeless clay mass roughly continuing the lines of the neck and then sloping shoulders. The extremely schematized body is decorated with three circular stamps. In this example, as in the above described specimens, we find the mechanical combination of a finely treated head with a coarsely executed body. The examples given in the present article do not reflect the whole range of Sogdian terracotta art. In spite of this they testify to the existence of similar plastic traditions in Bactria and Sogdiana. The figurines indicate that the 'new generation' of terracottas with renovated and complementary details are considerably lower in artistic merit than the original types. The renovated type always shows signs of artistic degradation. Does this fact indicate the total crisis of the artistic level of the epoch or region? The answer to this question is not simple. If we consider terracotta plastic art as an independent sphere of artistic activity with its centres and workshops, this question could be answered positively. However, to date this has not been archaeologically attested. In any case, the general level of artistic culture leaves a mark on the different categories of figurative art that are developed in the common course of traditions and innovations. On the other hand, all the studied specimens of terracotta sculpture point to the craftsman having a considerable independence although a highly limited artistic potential. However, also in this case, the evidence indicates that this initiative of the master craftsmen on such a wide scale is a sign of a shortage of new models. This can account for the eclectic combination in the same figure of the energy and high spirits of a Satyr with the tragic expression on the face of the head pressed into a mould. 68 [16]</page><page sequence="17">REFERENCES Abdullaev, K.
