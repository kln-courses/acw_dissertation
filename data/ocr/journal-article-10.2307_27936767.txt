<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Pabst: Venus als Heilige und Furie in Boccaccios Fiammetta dichtung (Schriften und Vortr?ge des Petrarca-Instituts K?ln, Scherpe Verlag Krefeld 1958, 8?. Walter Pabst's 41 pages of text and notes contain a fascinating and well documented discussion both of the Fiammetta as a work of literature and of the criticism and interpretation which it has gathered to itself over the centuries. Yet, in spite of Pabst's rigorous and informed scholarship, I think his mono graph will ultimately prove more valuable as a direct and illuminating "reading" of Boccaccio than as a correction of what he considers the historically misleading interpretations of others. If these two aspects are</page><page sequence="2">Besprechungen 455 from his point of view inseparable, they need not be so for a reviewer, concerned as he must be, with distinctions of value. Pabst's contribution to the reading of Fiammetta is his perception of the startling ambivalence of its representation of Venus first ?als Heilige" and then antithetically, ?als Furie" ? an ambivalence which he not only per ceives and describes but also for which he provides interesting antique and mediaeval background. The juncture of the didactic vision of the Middle Ages (a pattern inherited from Boethius, as Pabst brings out) with mytho logical adornment liberated from the ?frommen Zusammenhang" of the past is convincingly observed. As Pabst emphasizes in his closing sentence. Fiam metta's vision is such that, in spite of its general adherence to mediaeval doctrine and canons of beauty, ?ein humanistisch gebildeter Leserkreis m?chte darin schon die R?ckkehr der G?ttin zu ihren Urspr?ngen erken nen" (p. 33). As for the ambivalence itself, Pabst uses well-taken examples from the past (the Dido legend is a central one) to bring out its originality. If previously the lover could turn against love or Venus with reproach or recrimination (Juan Ruiz calls Don Amor "lobo" and "mal enemigo"), Fiammetta actually "contaminates" Venus with the antithetical image of a Fury: Oim? misera! io non dubito punto alle seguite cose pensando, che non Venere costei, che m'apparve, ma Tisifone fosse pi? tosto: la quale, posti gi? gli spaventevoli crini, non altrimenti che Giunone la chiarezza della sua deit?, e vestita la splendida forma, tale, quale quella si vest? la senile, cos? mi si fece vedere, come essa a Semele, simigliante consiglio d'ultima distruzione, qual fece ella, porgendomi..." (Book I, referred lo but not cited by Pabst). It is, of course, Fiammeta the writer who in retrospect believes she has seen through the false identity of Venus. She had no inkling of it at the time; for her it is not a ?Vorgriff" (the word is Pabst's) but a ?R?ckgriff". The moment of realization actually comes in the Fifth Book (Pabst's reference to the Sixth is surely a misprint) during an apostrophe to the absent Pamphilus: "Maladetta sia quella Dea... Certo io non credo che essa fosse Venere ma pi? tosto in forma di lei alcuna furia .. ." After this, the Furies become the principal supernatural reference on several occasions unmentioned by Pabst1). Uncertainty as to the very identity of Venus has now been added to Fiammetta's other doubts and insecurities. 1) Later in Book V, Fiammetta calls on all three Furies ("O Tesifone, infernal furia; O Megera, O Aletto") to avenge her against faithless Pamphilus and his new mistress. But this plea (as her passion grows) is insufficient. Fiammetta must take the role of fury herself, "... teco avr? battaglie . . . anzi tra'morti spiriti seguitandoti, con quelle ingiurie, che di l? s'adoperano, m'ingegner? di nojarti. ... E cos?, mentre vivrai, da cotal furia, me stimolante,</page><page sequence="3">456 Besprechungen What does Pabst make of this contamination? Stated very briefly, he as sumes that the reference to the Fury indicates Boccaccio's primary concern with a ?Schicksalsfrage" inherited ultimately from Boethius. What the Fiammetta is about?Pabst would maintain?is the helplessness of the will against fatality, an amorous fatality which, being amorous, has the face of Venus and, being fatal, that of Tisiphone. But if Boethius concludes with the triumph of free will, ?stellt der Italianer den von Venus gelenkten macht hungrigen, aber teilnahmslosen Amore und die f?rchterlich kalte Fortuna gegen?ber, die dem Menschen als Erinnerungsspur eines nur getr?umten freien Willens die reuige Selbstanklage l??t" (p. 31). Here is a thesis which, according to its sponsor, invalidates previous "psychological" interpretations ?classically that of de Sanctis and more recently those of Battaglia, Rastelli, the present reviewer, and others2). These critics, Pabst suggests, are comparable to those who, confronted with a mediaeval painting or illustra tion, only see its human or mundane aspects. Through a fundamental error in historical perspective only the ?untere H?lfte des Gem?ldes" attracts their attention and interpretation. They ignore the fact that, ?Der Sinn des Ganzen ergibt sich aus der Zweigeschossigkeit der dargestellten Welt und aus den Einwirkungen der oberen auf die untere Sph?re" (p. 21, Italics mine). Pabst apparently would have strengthened his case had he taken into account he Filostrato which contains in a rudimentary form a comparable theme?later developed to the full by Chaucer3). But had proceeded in sarai stimolata ..." In Book VII the Furies are mentioned as joining the angry gods, the world, and fortune in persecuting Jocasta. But the climactic appearance of Tisiphone is in the vision which accompanies the suicide at tempt: "Queste cose fra me dette, Tesifone venne dinanzi agli occhi miei. .." These multiple and changing roles bring ou the importance of Pabst's dis covery for the artistry of Boccaccio. He has hit upon one of the central ways used by Fiammeta to represent to herself the negative espect of her passion and fate (they are ultimately one and the same, as the Nurse points out) to herself. 2. It is inaccurate to include me in this list on the basis of the following statement from my Art of "La Celestina" (Madison Wis., 1956) : "Insofar as the Fiammetta is totally a totally subjective novel, and hence a remote ancestor of ? la recherche du temps perdu, it does present a variety of internal time and space". My whole effort in the paragraph which follows was to try to distinguish this "variety" from others ? including the one usually described as "psychological'. A further attempt will be made in this review. 3. These matters have been studied frequently by scholars of English lite rature (see, for example, W. S. Farnham's The Medieval Heritage of Eliza bethan Tragedy, Oxford, 1956, pp. 137?160). A comparison of the Troilus,</page><page sequence="4">Besprechungen 457 this way, he would surely have had to account for a critical factor con spicuous by its absence in this essay: the narrative form. Whereas in the Filostrato, Boccaccio tells the story as a more or less impersonal narrator, in the Fiammetta everything is seen through the eyes and from the point of view of the heroine. She herself is the narrator, and formally, by that very fact, it is the lower sphere which influences the higher and not the reverse. It was not an error of historical perspective that led de Sanclis and the others to pay attention o the "lower half of the picture". Rather, in the Fiammetta, it is only through the lower half of the picture that we know anything about the upper. It is a work disinguished by its faithful adherence to an organizing and unifying "point of view", a device common enough now but unfamiliar in the 14th century4). Actually, as theorists of ?ich-Erz?hlung" are accustomed to emphasize5), there is in our "elegy" a carefully constructed interplay of two points of view, that of the experienced Fiammetta who writes of the past in terms of her conclusive hopelessness and that of the inexperienced Fiammetta who speaks and dreams through an inconclusive and uncertain mixture of emotions. Here, I think is to be found the fundamental reason for Pabst's acutely observed contamination of ?Heilige" and ?Furie". When Fiammetta as the living prey of love sees the original vision, she does not doubt that her interlocutor is Venus. But at the end, after the final disappointment of Book V, when the two points of view are joined, she thinks rather of the frightful Tisiphone. In Book I, as we pointed out, it is only Fiammetta, the writer, who perceives the ambivalence and attempts to account for it by in which the Boethian terms of the thesis are apparent,, with the Fiammetta indicates imprudent and risky stretching of the evidence on Pabst's part. 4. The refusal of the Middle Ages to maintain point of view in any of the creative arts is a critical commonplace. Indeed it has been frequently pointed out that for mediaeval man the only valid and trustworthy point of view was that of God, himself. But in the case of Fiammetta this situation is entirely reversed. Everything is judged in terms of her feelings, seen through her feelings and vain reasoning. For example in her well known "esclama zione alla luna" even the phases of the moon are entered into the panorama of her desperation. For such a person relating such a narrative the difference of vision from reality is almost imperceptible, and it is characteristic of the Fiammetta that there is no hierarchical setting apart of the one from the other as in the case of a saint's life. It is a factor to be taken into account when meditating on the ambivalence and subjective metamorphoses of Fiammetta's dream-visions. 5. See, for example, Claudio Guill?n, "La disposici?n temporal del Lazarillo de Tormes", Hispanic Review, 1957. There is a good deal of German biblio graphy which it would be impertinent to cite for readers of this review.</page><page sequence="5">458 Besprechungen reference to another mythological disguise (the deception of Semele by Juno). It is a projection back into time from the point of view of the completed experience, an ironical narrative intrusion of the later desperation into the moment of highest hope. In this matter, Pabst's historical criticism might well have been supplemented by formalist considerations. A purely historical approach has led him to misinterpret his own discovery and, even worse, to underestimate Boccaccio as an artist. This disagreement with Pabst, however, does not imply return to an anachronistic psychological interpretation of the Fiammetta. Pabst, it seems to me, is justifiably suspicious of the adjective. Insofar as it pretends to offer an a historical explanation of the text, psychology is surely misleading. Subjectivity?that is to say, the point of view of inwardness?is not mo nopolized by Proust and Freud (or even Spencer and Descartes). In the caso of Fiammetta, the inwardness formally so emphasized is, I would maintain, exemplary of the renascent Stoicism of the period. It is that same inwardness, helpless and at odds with itself, stressed by Boccaccio's friend and mentor, Petrarch, in his breviary of the Stoic revival, De remediis utriusque fortunae. I refer particularly to chapters such as "De ambiguo statu", or "De discordia animi fluctuantis", chapters in my opinion much more relevant to the spirit, vision, and special historical tension of the Fiammetta than anything to be found either in Boethius or in Freud. It is precisely in these chapters that Petrarch prepares doctrinally the particular hell of Fiammetta, the hell of a mind helplessly prey to a fortune no longer conceived of an objective anthropomorphic divinity. In admitting passion, Fiammetta has been disarmed of reason. She is exposed, stripped psychically, and, despite the "remedies" of the Nurse (much of Chapter V resembles a De remediis dialogue, with the Nurse in the role of reason),, her surrender to the power of fortune is hopeless and unconditional. She may imagine mythological apparitions; she may attempt to explain her situation to herself in terms of the amorous language and imagery made available to her by her tradition; but ultimately we know, and even she knows, she has been the architect of her own fate6). Her misconduct was that of disobedience to Stoic precepts. 6) In the Conclusione addressed to the book itself this becomes very clear: ?Io, e tu non siamo s? dalla fortuna avvallati, che essi non sieno grandissimi in noi da poter dare. N? questi sono per? altri, se non quelli, i quali essa a niun misero pu? torre, cio? essempli di s? dare a que' che sono felici, acciocch? essi pongano modo a'ioro beni, e fuggano di divenire simile a noi. Il quale (siccome tu puoi) s? fatto dimostra di me, che, se savie sono, nei loro amori savissime ad ovviare agli occulti inganni de'giovani diventino per paura de'nostri mali". The moral thesis, in other words, necessarily implies both freedom and responsibility.</page><page sequence="6">Besprechungen 459 At the beginning (which in a very real sense is also the end) Fiammetta sinks so deep into desperation as to question the very existence of the "gods": "priego, s'alcuna Deit? ? nel cielo... che la dolente memoria ajuti..." Boccaccio is here unconcerned with the theological problem of free will and predestination which preoccupied Boethius and which he, himself, broached in the Filostrato. Fiammetta is doomed from within, not predestined from without7). If Pabst had pursued his search into the im mediate intellectual and human climate of Boccaccio's creation (rather than basing everything on those abstract historical schemes called Middle Ages and Renaissance) 8) he would have discovered what I take to be the historical sense of Fiammetta's formal novelty. It is a work in which medieval visions and Renaissance mythological adornment can fuse precisely because they are presented through self-consciousness, through Stoic "sub jectivity". That is to say the kind of self-consciousness which arises from feeling oneself subjected, a subject?even though not of the sort conceived of by later psychologies9). Harvard University.
