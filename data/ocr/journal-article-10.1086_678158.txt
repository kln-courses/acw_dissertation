         <p>At first sight [algebra] appeared to us something like symbols bewitched, and running about the world in search of meaning.</p>

      <p>On the face of it, deductive logic—whether embodied in an Aristotelian syllogism or a problem in Boolean algebra—would seem to have little to do with aesthetics. Logic, after all, purports to systematize the reasoning process precisely to safeguard it from the influence of opinion, feeling, or taste; it instructs, but it does not aim to delight. The development of mathematical logic in mid- and late-Victorian England would, then, seem to have no obvious bearing on aesthetic paradigms. But Victorian innovators in mathematical logic, focused as they were on producing new diagrammatic and notational techniques, were crucial participants in debates regarding the relation of signs to their referents.<sup>2</sup> That the new logic was often called symbolic logic suggests that this quintessentially rationalist pursuit had a part to play in a much larger conversation regarding what George Boole called the “conception of … fit[ness] and beaut[y]” in representation.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>As Paul de Man remarks, the end of the eighteenth century was a moment “when the word ‘symbol’ [came] to supplant other denominations for figural language,” but the “supremacy of the symbol” during the course of the century that followed was not limited to the domains of “literary taste, literary criticism, and literary history.”<sup>4</sup> Indeed, in nineteenth-century England the word <italic>symbol</italic> was used in a range of discourses—from mathematics to theology—because it was understood to foreground the importance of the bond between sign and referent not just in figural language but in any act of representation.<sup>5</sup> Whether the term was presumed to designate a sign with an organic, ineluctable bond to its referent or an artificial, conventional one varied widely, however. Perhaps the most compelling positive construal of the word came at the beginning of the century: in his <italic>Statesman’s Manual</italic> Samuel Taylor Coleridge formulates the ideal of the symbol so as to make it a crucial term of biblical and literary analysis, defining it as a sign that partakes of the reality it represents. Coleridge regarded this correspondence between sign and referent—manifest in its purest form in God’s word—as the basis of all inspired poetry, opposing it to the “picture-language” of allegory. It was the task of the symbol to bind securely the noumenal and the phenomenal: the symbol was characterized “above all by the translucence of the Eternal through and in the Temporal.”<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p>De Man famously describes this account as a mystification of subject-object relations,<sup>7</sup> but by the end of his career Coleridge himself proclaimed many of his own poems mere allegories, and the writers who followed him—even conservative and religious ones—were largely skeptical of the tenability of the romantic symbol. In her short poem “Symbols,” devout Anglican Christina Rossetti explicitly dramatizes the failure of the Coleridgean ideal: the speaker, angry when a bird’s nest from which she had expected new life fails to fulfill its symbolic promise, tramples it.<sup>8</sup> Thomas Carlyle’s Teufelsdröckh laments, “are not the tatters and rags of superannuated worn-out Symbols … dropping off every where, to hoodwink, to halter, to tether you … !”<sup>9</sup> As evidenced in the epigraph from De Morgan above, even in the domain of math and science symbols were regarded with suspicion; the British mathematical establishment was suspicious of algebra and analysis in part because of their reliance on arbitrary symbols.<sup>10</sup> Indeed, by midcentury, the word <italic>symbol</italic> was typically used to indicate a merely conventional or incomplete suture between sign and referent; thus John Henry Newman complained of James Stephens that he regards “sacraments and doctrines … rather as symbols of a philosophy than as <italic>truths</italic>—as the mere accidental types of principles.”<sup>11</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The work of Lewis Carroll, which patently does not aim at Coleridgean translucency, would seem an unlikely place to look for a resuscitation of the value of the symbol. Carroll’s writing is, after all, famously about failures of reference. In <italic>The Hunting of the Snark</italic> the sailor-hunters rejoice to have a map that is an “absolute blank” because typical cartographic markings “are merely conventional signs!”<sup>12</sup> In his <italic>Alice</italic> books, Carroll dramatizes both the freedom and the dangers of life in a contingent representational order, a world where there are as many systems of reference as there are characters. But in his final work of fiction, <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic>, Carroll was to dramatize the virtues of a new kind of symbolism—a symbolism that frankly confessed its nonreferentiality even as it proclaimed its almost hieratic capacity to order the world. This is a symbolism that derives from Carroll’s own work in logic and developments in modern logic generally. Carroll and his colleagues working in the field of symbolic or mathematical logic would argue that while particular symbols might be “bewitched,” “worn-out,” or “merely conventional” the systems by which they were organized could be designed so as to be at least formally coherent and that this formal coherence could become a new site of value. Mathematical logic arguably offered the ultimate codification of what Elaine Hadley calls “liberal cognition,” which she describes as formalist in character: “these mental attitudes function as ‘formal’ approaches rather than particular contents.”<sup>13</sup> If liberal political discourse enshrined formal procedure on ethical grounds, associating it with ideals of equality and justice, logical discourse would locate its peculiar virtue in its beauty and “purity.”<sup>14</sup>

         <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> is a far cry from Coleridge’s scriptural representational ideal. It is as self-consciously nonsensical as the <italic>Alice</italic> books and does not even include a frame to ground it in an ostensible reality. And yet it is undeniably a redemption narrative, and it concludes by foregrounding a symbol—a symbol the referent of which is the almost salvific power of formal coherence. Quirky as it is, <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> is exemplary of an impulse in Victorian logic and late Victorian literature to discover in the formal perfectability of sign systems some recompense for the ungroundedness of representation and the moral relativism that ungroundedness seemed to imply. The novel dramatizes the capacity of symbolic logic to redeem representation by locating positive value—aesthetic, social, and even spiritual—in the systematicity of formal interrelationships. Ultimately, then, although its best-known legacy is the Boolean algebra that underlay the development of the modern computer, symbolic logic would play a role in the revaluation of symbolism generally.</p>

         <title>1. Symbolic logic</title>
         <p>In their aims, Victorian logicians were indistinguishable from their predecessors; they understood their task to be the construction of formulas that could be relied upon to produce valid inferences.<sup>15</sup> Nor were they the first to employ symbols for this purpose; as I. M. Bochenski remarks, Gottfried Leibniz might be considered “the founder of <italic>symbolic</italic> logic as such” because he used artificial symbols not only for variables, as in earlier versions of logic, but also for logical constants.<sup>16</sup> Leibniz’s researches were, however, unknown to Victorian logicians, and “the vast movement of mathematical logic that centered in [England] in the fundamental problem of expressing thought by means of symbols seems to have been influenced by the adoption of the continental symbols of the differential and integral calculus.”<sup>17</sup> Thus Boole is generally regarded as “stand[ing] at the beginning of the continuous development” of what is variously termed symbolic, mathematical, or theoretical logic (<italic>HFL</italic>, p. 267). Boole describes his project thus: “a successful attempt to express logical propositions by symbols, the laws of whose combinations should be founded upon the laws of the mental processes which they represent, would, so far, be a step toward a philosophical language” (<italic>MAL</italic>, p. 5). The attraction to the ideal of a philosophical language is familiar enough, but Boole’s emphasis on combination signals his difference from his forebears; he does not aim to ground his symbols in “reality,” either noumenal or phenomenal. Indeed, he explicitly sets aside the problem of what signs mean: “By some it is maintained, that [signs] represent the conceptions of the mind alone; by others, that they represent things. The question is not of great importance here, as its decision cannot affect the laws according to which signs are employed” (<italic>ILT</italic>, p. 26). It is these laws of interrelation upon which the logician must focus.</p>
         <p>Indeed, the triumph of the new logic was precisely to make the formal, ungrounded character of language a matter of explicit principle. Formalism had been important to earlier varieties of logic, Scholasticism especially, but in the mathematical logic of the nineteenth century it was “erected into a general principle” (<italic>HFL</italic>, p. 266). De Morgan pithily remarked that “logic bears on its modern banner, The form of thought, the whole form, and nothing but the form.”<sup>18</sup> Although Boole did aspire to found his symbolic system on fundamental analytic procedures derived from the laws of mental processes, his lasting achievement lay in his recognition of the arbitrary and conventional nature of even logical language: “There exist, indeed, certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined. To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please” (<italic>ILT</italic>, p. 6). This freedom of interpretation had profound implications. As Federigo Enriques explains, whereas “the development of logic before the nineteenth century did not apparently change the traditional conception of the structure of the demonstrative sciences,” in the nineteenth century we see the culmination of a reform of logic based on a fundamental shift initiated with Leibniz: “the ontological presuppositions of ancient rationalism are made to retreat before the psychological criticism of knowledge. Logic thus becomes conscious of its formal character, being reduced to a doctrine of mental processes” (<italic>HDL</italic>, p. 110). This “reduction” amounts to an entire transformation of the spirit of logical inquiry; as Boole himself succinctly put it, “we ought no longer to associate Logic and Metaphysics, but Logic and Mathematics” (<italic>MAL</italic>, p. 13).</p>
         <p>De Morgan, whose work on logic was contemporaneous with Boole’s, describes this shift away from the metaphysical in usefully general terms: <disp-quote>
               <p>The philosophers of the middle ages were much concerned with the <italic>is</italic>, or <italic>essence</italic>, of things: they argued to their own minds, with great justice, that if they could only find out what a thing is, they should find out all about it: they tried, and failed. Their successors, taking warning by their example, have inverted the proposition; and have satisfied themselves that the only way of finding what a thing is, lies in finding what we can about it.<sup>19</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> De Morgan himself strove to evacuate the verb <italic>to be</italic> of essential content, “separat[ing] form from matter in the copula of the common syllogism” and making the copula a general sign of transitive relation (“OS,” p. 79). By emphasizing relationship over essence De Morgan helped to lay the foundation for the development of symbolic logic; as Peter Heath explains, De Morgan strove to make logic “a pure science of (uninterpreted) symbols and their laws of combination.”<sup>20</sup> Boole was even more successful in this regard; rather than thinking of “logic as an abstraction from actual processes, as all previous logicians had done, [he understood it] as a formal construction for which an interpretation is sought only subsequently” (<italic>HFL</italic>, p. 279).</p>
         <p>This focus on formal structure is reflected in the fact that Boole and his peers sought to produce a highly nuanced combinatorial calculus of classes. For Boole, classification is the fundamental function of language: “that which renders Logic possible, is … our ability to conceive of a class…. Assuming the notion of a class, we are able, from any conceivable collection of objects, to separate by a mental act, those which belong to a given class, and to contemplate them apart from the rest” (<italic>MAL</italic>, pp. 4–5). In keeping with this emphasis on discrimination rather than definition, Boole and De Morgan tend to regard concepts extensionally, as “an assemblage of objects,” rather than intensionally, as “an assemblage of attributes or properties” (<italic>HDL</italic>, p. 157). The goal of classification is not the discovery of the essence of a thing but its distinction from other, similar things; as De Morgan puts it, “by <italic>real</italic> definition, I mean such an explanation of the word … as will be sufficient to separate the things contained under that word from all others.” Indeed, De Morgan regards names as a kind of conceptual enclosure: “A name ought to be like a boundary, which clearly and undeniably either shuts in, or shuts out, every idea that can be suggested.”<sup>21</sup> Such enclosure is literalized in the geometrical diagramming practiced by Venn and Carroll; each square of Carroll’s diagram functions as “an enclosure assigned to a certain Class of Things”<sup>22</sup> (figs. 1–4). Carroll’s diagrams, like the chessboard landscape of <italic>Through the Looking-Glass</italic>, work by making identity a matter of context and relationship; in this square Alice is a pawn, in that, a queen. The goal is not to determine the essential nature of a person or thing but to determine—with assurance—to what class it belongs at a given moment.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Given their investment in the effective construction of sign systems, it is unsurprising that symbolic logicians took classical logic to task precisely for being unsystematic. With his typical modesty, Boole seeks to “remove one or two prevailing misapprehensions respecting [the Aristotelian system’s] extent and sufficiency,” claiming that it is “not a science, but a collection of scientific truths, too incomplete to form a system of themselves, and not sufficiently fundamental to serve as the foundation upon which a perfect system may rest” (<italic>ILT</italic>, pp. 226, 241). Carroll more boldly complains that “ordinary text-books of Formal Logic…. elaborately discussed no less than <italic>nineteen</italic> different forms of <italic>Syllogisms</italic>—each with its own special and exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored”; moreover, “they have limited <italic>Sorites</italic> to <italic>two</italic> forms only, of childish simplicity; and these they have dignified with special <italic>names</italic>, apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed!” (<italic>SL</italic>, p. 183). Reliant on convention, excluding legitimate syllogistic forms, and dignifying simple ones, traditional logic failed, in the opinion of Victorian logicians, to be genuinely systematic, refusing as it did to recognize entire classes of deductive operations.</p>
         <p>Victorian logicians fault classical logic not only for its incompleteness but also for its blindness to its own arbitrary and conventional nature, its presumption of absolute authority. De Morgan complains that even those among his contemporaries who are ostensibly devoted to modern formalism sometimes respond to novel deductive techniques like servile subjects of Aristotle rather than freeborn Englishmen: <disp-quote>
               <p>so soon as a form of thought is exhibited which does not come within the arbitrary selection, the series of elegant extracts, it is forthwith pronounced material:— <disp-quote>
                     <p>St Aristotle! what wild notions!</p>

            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The logician who challenges Aristotelian exclusivity risks being treated as a traitor to authority both divine and political. Carroll’s mockery of Aristotelian convention is, not surprisingly, even more dramatic. In an appendix addressed to teachers, Carroll describes logicians whose work “run[s] in the ordinary grooves” as absurdly devoted to external authority; he complains that they “speak of the Copula of a Proposition ‘with bated breath’, almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain <italic>what</italic> was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it” (<italic>SL</italic>, p. 165). While it might seem at first that Carroll’s satire is directed against the anthropomorphism implied in granting agency to language, it quickly becomes clear that his real complaint is with the reluctance of traditional logicians to challenge conventional authority; they “seem to me to take much too humble a position [on the matter of negative propositions]. When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the Copula—always a rather fussy ‘heavy father’, asks them ‘Am <italic>I</italic> to have the “not”, or will you tack it on to the Predicate?’ they are much too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, ‘Leave it to <italic>you</italic>, Sir!’” (<italic>SL</italic>, p. 172). Carroll, “in opposition to this view,” “maintain[s] that any writer of a book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use. If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his book, ‘Let it be understood that by the word “<italic>black</italic>” I shall always mean “<italic>white</italic>”, and that by the word “<italic>white</italic>” I shall always mean “<italic>black</italic>”,’ I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think it” (<italic>SL</italic>, p. 166). The author’s right to define and redefine individual signs is complete, as long as his symbolic system is internally consistent.</p>

      <sec id="sc2">
         <title>2. Carroll’s Calculus of Classes</title>
         <p>Carroll saw with particular acuity that the establishment of a socially functional representational order out of a welter of potentially “injudicious” signs was no simple matter. In the <italic>Alice</italic> books, when words function descriptively and literally, the effect is comically absurd, as with the “Bread-and-butter-fly.”<sup>23</sup> But when a language user defines his own terms, when he calls black “white,” he unavoidably imposes his vision—and his interests—on others. Alice’s encounter with Humpty Dumpty dramatizes just this problem. Humpty explains that “‘when <italic>I</italic> use a word … it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’” (<italic>TLG</italic>, p. 136). No timorous traditional logician, Humpty forthrightly describes his relationship to language as a power struggle: “‘the question is … which is to be master—that’s all’” (<italic>TLG</italic>, p. 136). Being social constructs, signs in the <italic>Alice</italic> books are always subject to social contestation. Alice remarks of Humpty that “‘he talks about [conversation] just as if it was a game!’” (<italic>TLG</italic>, p. 134), and, indeed, both <italic>Alice</italic> books are structured around competitive games—cards and chess—and are thus, at a foundational level, about the constitution of experience in and through contests for power. Because these games are “merely conventional,” individual contestants can change the terms of engagement on a whim; thus Alice throws the Queen of Hearts’s court into disarray simply by redefining it as “‘nothing but a pack of cards!’”<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Not governed by a singular and authoritative representational order, wonderland and the looking-glass world are simultaneously liberating and terrifying. The threat of violence looms over them and can only be managed by ultimately returning the reader to a quotidian world where convention defines reality, a world where black is black and playing cards and kittens don’t talk back. But Carroll’s final novel, written after his works on symbolic logic, acknowledges the arbitrariness of signs while simultaneously incorporating a faith in the possibility of systemic “purity,” a faith that allows Carroll to resolve the contests for power that the novel describes <italic>within</italic> the fantasy world of the fiction. Published in two books, <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> and <italic>Sylvie and Bruno Concluded</italic>, this final novel has not been popular with critics; moralizing, mawkishly sentimental, and generically jumbled, the best one can say about it is that it is “one of the most interesting failures in English literature.”<sup>25</sup> But the work was “unquestionably the most ambitious literary undertaking of Dodgson’s career,”<sup>26</sup> and Carroll himself remarked that, while he wasn’t sure if it was “better, or worse, than the <italic>Alice</italic> books,” he took “a far deeper interest in it, as having tried to put more real <italic>thought</italic> into it.”<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>I would argue that if <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> is not entirely successful as a novel, its awkwardness stems from its determination to advance a logical argument for the salvific power of formal coherence while still acknowledging the arbitrary relationship of form to content. Indeed, Carroll actually heightens that arbitrariness, for in <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> not only are signs ungrounded but there is, as it were, no solid ground to which they <italic>could</italic> refer. In this novel, even more than the <italic>Alice</italic> books, identities themselves are indeterminate and constantly shifting. Sylvie and Bruno are sometimes fairies and sometimes children; they change size continually; they make themselves invisible; they even create ghostlike “phlizzes”—virtual-reality creations ranging from flowers to governesses. The very environment is changeable in this novel, and the narrator moves abruptly between a number of different realms, each with its own physical properties and social conventions. Carroll makes no effort to explain, render consistent, or otherwise naturalize these properties or conventions; even in the most ordinary of the worlds of <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> characters do little more than discuss the limits of human knowledge.</p>
         <p>But if the constitution of the particular worlds that comprise <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> offers little in the way of epistemological certainty, over the course of the novel Carroll does develop meaningful formulas for relating those worlds to each other. Ultimately, Carroll will suggest that the formal comparability of those worlds is an indication that the “nonsense” generated by the multiplication of representational systems obscures a deeper and more encompassing order. As we will see, the driving impulse of the book, repeated at all levels of the narrative, is the revelation of class relationships; the narrator increasingly discovers of the sets of persons around him that they are “the same, but ‘with a difference.’”<sup>28</sup> Because it is the revelation of structural similarity that most matters in the novel, the resolution of the plot springs from these revelations rather than from the personal development of individual characters. The book is invested less in describing a chain of events than in constructing formal comparative mechanisms by means of which the chaos of things and persons can be organized into coherent classes.</p>
         <p>The vagaries of setting and narration that characterize the first part of the book are crucial to the novel’s work of establishing this ultimate coherence. Like the <italic>Alice</italic> books, <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic> features multiple worlds, but, unlike the <italic>Alice</italic> books, it does not set a fantasy world against the backdrop of a normative one. There are three primary settings—England, Outland, and Fairyland—no one of which is given priority. But the book’s most unusual feature is the way it segues between these lands: the narrator, an old man who is given to dozing, finds himself unaccountably transported from one reality to another, sometimes as frequently as several times in a chapter. By the end of the book it appears that despite his illness and obvious dotage he is not simply asleep and dreaming when he suddenly finds himself in other worlds. As the story proceeds he begins to slip from one reality to another without so much as a wink, and the denizens of one world increasingly appear in others. It gradually becomes clear that the narrator is not afflicted with senility but gifted with special insight, and some of the most emotionally charged moments in the novel are those in which he discovers definitive connections between worlds and persons: <disp-quote>
               <p>I saw the dear old Professor approaching us, and also saw, what was stranger still, that he was visible to <italic>Lady Muriel</italic>!</p>
               <p>What was to be done? Had the fairy-life been merged in the real life? … The words were on my lips (“I see an old friend of mine in the lane: if you don’t know him, may I introduce him to you?”) when the strangest thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke.</p>
               <p>“I see an old friend of mine in the lane,” she said: “if you don’t know him, may I introduce him to you?” [<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 703]</p>
            </disp-quote> In fact, the Professor who is approaching here is not the one the narrator thinks he is but a Professor from another land who looks very like him. No matter. The narrator’s delight is a function of his discovery of a parallelism between the two Professors on the one hand and himself and Lady Muriel on the other. It is the coordination of what had seemed distinct realities that is thrilling.</p>
         <p>The novel’s plotting enacts a similar convergence. The narrative the old man tells consists of two, largely independent, tales. In the first, a Sub-Warden and his ambitious wife endeavor to become emperor and empress of Outland by ousting its legitimate ruler, the father of Sylvie and Bruno. Just at the moment of the Sub-Warden’s success a storm strikes that leaves him repentant and therefore worthy of acting in the absence of the Warden, who announces his intention to return to Elfland to rule there. In the second plotline the narrator’s friend, a doctor named Arthur, loses his love, Muriel, to another man, and travels to India in an effort to reinfuse his life with meaning. When he returns he learns that Muriel’s engagement has been broken, and he marries her before leaving again to help the sufferers of an unnamed epidemic. Presumed dead when he does not return, he reappears at the end of the novel, ill but alive. This second plot is concluded first, as Arthur’s doctor announces “it is <italic>Life</italic>!” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 822). We then return to the first plot, the final moment of which is unrelated to the political intrigue that ostensibly structured it: Sylvie learns that the magic locket her father gave her at the beginning of the book is two-sided and reads not only “SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL” but also “ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 823). At the moment Sylvie discovers this fact a voice that seems to be both Sylvie’s and an angel’s pronounces “<italic>it is Love</italic>” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 824). Ultimately, then, the book binds together very different plots, characters, and places in the parallelism of the two pronouncements “it is <italic>Life</italic>” and “<italic>it is Love</italic>.” The novel’s hero, finally, is not the kingly Warden, the self-sacrificing Arthur, or even the angelic Sylvie; it is the capacity of formal structures to reveal meaningful similarities.</p>
         <p>To trace the fortunes of form in this novel we must begin with its first chapter, in which the ungrounded character of signs is the source of absurdist comedy. While the book ends on a note of happy unification, it begins abruptly with a scene devoted to the empty formality of modern political relations: <disp-quote>
               <p>LESS BREAD! MORE TAXES!</p>
               <p>—and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) “Who roars for the Sub-Warden?” <italic>Everybody</italic> roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some “Taxes!”, but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted.<sup>29</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> What follows is a comic scene of manipulation in which the Chancellor, who has fomented the revolt, tries to direct its revolutionary energies on behalf of the Sub-Warden, confusedly talking to the people about “‘your <italic>wrongs</italic>—no, I mean your <italic>rights</italic>’” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 503). Here, political rights and the ideal of the vox populi are entirely emptied of meaning. Politics—even revolutionary politics—are presented as nothing but a set of conventions through which persons without substantial identities enact a will not their own. Under such circumstances political representation could never be representative in any real sense. As in the <italic>Alice</italic> books, because signs function arbitrarily, their meaning is unstable and contentious.</p>
         <p>The emptiness of signs is literalized in the person of a mad gardener, who holds the keys to the gate of the palace garden. It is he who enables Sylvie and Bruno to travel from one land to another, and as metaphysical gatekeeper he enters and exits the narrative more than any other secondary character. Unlike the typical gatekeeper figure, however, the Gardener does not make meaningful decisions about whether or not to let people pass; he himself claims that “‘I never means nothing’” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 536). This makes him as frightening as the arbitrary despots of the <italic>Alice</italic> books; the narrator likens him to an old crab, with “a vacancy in its stare, and an aimless violence in its behaviour” and learns to flee his “horrid discordant voice.” Covered with wisps of loose straw that “suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come out,” the Gardener permits movement between worlds but pointedly denies that his actions are significant (<italic>SB</italic>, pp. 541, 545, 526). Like a scarecrow, or the demonstrators who fail to notice that the content of their chant “Less Bread! More Taxes!” undermines their self-interest, he serves a recognizable function but does so in the absence of intention. A parody of Kantian formalism, he embodies purpose without purposiveness.</p>
         <p>Although a husbandman, then, the Gardener does not impose art on a substrate of nature, much less use art to cultivate, complete, or perfect nature. Instead, he is the (dis)embodiment of formal artifice pure and simple. Associated less with plants than with poetry, the Gardener is first introduced to us as the disembodied origin of a song. That song seems initially to derive from the narrator’s perceptions but goes on to develop itself mechanically rather than organically, according to the laws of grammar and then stanzaic structure: <disp-quote>
               <p>“I thought I saw—” I murmured sleepily: and then the phrase insisted on conjugating itself, and ran into “you thought you saw—he thought he saw—” and then it suddenly went off into a song:— <verse-group>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>“He thought he saw an Elephant</italic>,</verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>That practiced on a fife:</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>He looked again, and found it was</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>A letter from his wife.</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>‘At length I realise,’ he said</italic>,</verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>‘The bitterness of Life</italic>!’”</verse-line>
                  </verse-group> And what a wild being it was who sang these wild words! A Gardener he seemed to be—yet surely a mad one. [<italic>SB</italic>, p. 526]</p>
            </disp-quote> Not only does the tail wag the dog here, but the Gardener’s wild song, fragments of which appear sporadically throughout the book, highlights the problem of failed classification. Subsequent stanzas of the song all take the form of the one above. The speaker thinks he sees one thing, only to realize it is something altogether different. In all these verses the speaker not only confuses unlike things—an albatross and a stamp, a hippo and a bank clerk, a snake and the middle of next week—but also confuses conceptual registers. Typically, what appears at first to be an animal proves to be an artificial human construct. Taxonomy fails because the things of nature, rather than providing a reliable ground for determining likeness and difference, are repeatedly found to be abstractions. These equations of strikingly unlike things are disconcerting, even to the Gardener himself, who feels his own identity to be implicated in their disorder; the Professor tells the children that the Gardener is unhappy because “‘that song is his own history’” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 785). Midway through the book, the Professor asks the Gardener if he has seen the other Professor, “something like me, but different,” and the Gardener responds with violent agitation (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 568): “‘Ah, well!’ the Gardener said with a kind of groan. ‘Things change so, here. Whenever I look again, it’s sure to be something different! Yet I does my duty!’” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 526).</p>
         <p>But if the Gardener is empty of content, by simply doing his duty in strictly formal terms he ultimately becomes a vehicle for the revelation of meaning, even if that meaning is not his own. For over the course of the narrative it becomes increasingly clear that the garden gate functions like a calculus for revealing class relationships. In his first appearance, for instance, the Gardener lets the children and narrator through the garden gate in pursuit of a beggar to whom they want to give food. When they meet up with the beggar, he proves to be the children’s father, the regal king of Elfland, and they discover that they are now in Elfland despite the fact that it is a thousand miles from Outland (see <italic>SB</italic>, p. 529). When it is time for the narrator and children to return to Outland they begin to hear the Gardener’s song again, the Gardener flings open the gate, and the narrator suddenly finds himself, not in Elfland or Outland with the children, but back at Elveston Station with Lady Muriel. As elsewhere in the novel, abrupt narrative transitions serve to literalize the spiritual proximity of ostensibly very different worlds: the beggar is transformed into the children’s father, who, although a king, is humble and selfless; Sylvie is replaced by Muriel, who speaks in “Sylvie’s own voice, and with Sylvie’s gentle pleading eyes” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 528). The novel is rich in such equations, whose function is to reveal conceptual similarities; Sylvie is a fairy child and Lady Muriel Orme an elegant woman, but both are gentle and kind. In the scene quoted above in which the narrator confuses the Professor from Outland with the Professor of Muriel’s acquaintance he describes himself as seeing first one and then the other in a succession of transformations he likens to the metamorphoses of “one of the shapes in a kaleidoscope” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 703). Transporting characters between realities that are construed, like the images in a kaleidoscope, as concatenations of abstract representations, the Gardener’s gate functions like the equal sign of an equation or like De Morgan’s copula—“a general sign of transitive relation” with no intrinsic meaning. Just as the characters who people these equations matter precisely insofar as they are amenable to abstraction, the garden gate is empty of inherent meaning even as it is rich in formal significance.</p>
         <p>The “development” of the Gardener’s character is in keeping with his gate’s function as a formal switchpoint, a means for elucidating likeness. Over the course of the book the Gardener’s madness remains unchanged, but his morbid melancholy disappears; his first encounter with the Professor from Outland proves to be an emotional turning point for the Gardener, for whom the Professor provides epistemological relief not by convincing him of the groundedness of representation but by making him conscious of its formal nature. After insisting that he won’t break the “‘<italic>Rules</italic>’” by letting the children through the gate—while hinting that he would accept a bribe—the Gardener opens the gate and holds out his hand for money. To this the Professor responds, “‘you are acting by <italic>Rule</italic> … in opening the door for <italic>me</italic>. And now it’s open, we are going out by <italic>Rule</italic>—the Rule of <italic>Three</italic>’” (<italic>SB</italic>, pp. 568–69). The rule of three is a mathematical formula that would have been familiar to the Victorian schoolchild: the product of the means of a proportion equals the product of the extremes (if a/b=c/x, then ax=bc; that is, x=bc/a). This “rule” can be brought into play in these circumstances only because the words <italic>rule</italic> and <italic>three</italic> have variable referents: three persons need to pass through the gate, and the phrase <italic>rule of three</italic> provides them a verbal counterweight to the Gardener’s invocation of rule. Not only does the use of the rule of three in this context underscore the arbitrariness of linguistic reference, but the rule itself is a formula for equivalence, a calculus, and one that was typically taught by rote during the nineteenth century, without an explanation of its workings. Form confronts form in the Professor’s riposte, the walkers pass through the threshold, and the Gardener is left empty-handed.</p>
         <p>Rather than being angry or distressed by this emptiness, however, the Gardener is soothed, it seems, by the Professor’s recourse to pure formula: <disp-quote>
               <p>The Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go out; but, as he locked the door behind us, we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself <verse-group>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>“He thought he saw a Garden-Door</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>That opened with a key:</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>He looked again, and found it was</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>A Double Rule of Three:</italic>
                     </verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>‘And all its mystery,’ he said</italic>,</verse-line>
                     <verse-line>
                        <italic>‘Is clear as day to me!</italic>’” [<italic>SB</italic>, p. 569]</verse-line>
                  </verse-group>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> The double rule of three operates like the single one but involves more information; it is as if the Gardener here revels in the discovery of the formulaic nature of his gatekeeper function, deliberately heightening its formal complexity. He suddenly realizes that even complicated versions of formulas are as “clear as day” once recognized for what they are: immaterial, abstract keys. For the first time in the Gardener’s song, the abstraction to which an object is likened seems actually to bear some relation to it, if only by virtue of the Professor’s Humpty-Dumptyish proclamation. Like the Professor, the Gardener is saved not by nature or right but by rule.</p>
         <p>The apotheosis of form is most apparent in scenes with the Warden in which the mere shapes of letters, quite apart from what they might signify, prove to have a mystical power. In the first of these scenes the Warden scatters a handful of dust while pronouncing a charm, and the “cloud of dust spread itself out through the air, as if it were alive, forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others.” Bruno notices that “‘It makes letters! It makes words!’” but as Sylvie endeavors to read them she and her brother discover themselves once again with the Gardener, transitioning to another world (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 545). In a later, climactic repetition of this moment a hurricane fills the air with dust “which took strange shapes in the air, and seemed to form words” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 811). Again, the words never become legible, and the dust vanishes as suddenly as it appeared. This storm of form nevertheless converts the “vacant stare” and “meaningless smile” of the Sub-Warden and his wife into the open expressions of a man and woman who spontaneously repent their wrongdoings (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 811). Form itself proves strangely efficacious, as the antagonists whose machinations we have deplored for hundreds of pages are suddenly and completely morally transformed.</p>
         <p>Remarkable as this moment is, the novel does not conclude with it but with a rumination on form pure and simple. Sylvie’s locket, which Martin Gardner describes as “the novel’s central symbol,”<sup>30</sup> serves as the ultimate sign of the power of form to generate meaningful equations. Early in the story, Sylvie chooses between two magic lockets, one that says “Sylvie will love all” and one that says “all will love Sylvie,” charming her father by preferring the first. On the novel’s final pages he asks Sylvie if she still has the “Jewel,” and she answers “‘Oh, <italic>yes</italic>!’” with “unusual eagerness” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 822). Sylvie and Bruno then discover that, depending on how the light passes through it, the jewel can appear either blue or red, and “‘the words are all different!’” reading either “‘SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL’” or “‘ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE’” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 823). In the novel’s illustration of the locket, a jewel in the shape of a heart has the words “SYLVIE WILL LOVE” around its edge and the word “ALL” running through its center. Just as the cut of the crystal colors the light that passes through it, so the layout of the words inscribed on the locket enables it to convert one truth into another. The classical rhetorical figure of the chiasmus is updated so that it reads like the commutative property, a mathematical law rather than an oratorical flourish. Language, here, is, as it were, mathematized. In <italic>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</italic>, the Mad Hatter mocks Alice for claiming that meaning what she says is the same as saying what she means: “‘you might just as well say that “I see what I eat” is the same thing as “I eat what I see!”’”<sup>31</sup> In <italic>Sylvie and Bruno</italic>, however, Carroll’s impulse is precisely to make such formulas work.<sup>32</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The algorithm embodied in Sylvie’s jewel dramatizes the power of form to revive the practical and spiritual efficacy of representation. Unlike the Coleridgean symbol, Sylvie’s locket does not partake of the reality it represents. Bruno is baffled that Sylvie chose one locket and ended up having the other as well; his awkward question, “‘<italic>could</italic> Sylvie choose a thing from itself?’” captures both the tautological Humpty-Dumptyishness of this act of symbolism and its ambition to produce something at least akin to the Coleridgean ideal (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 823). Although called a locket, Sylvie’s jewel is solid and does not contain anything within it. Nevertheless, its faceted form, like the Professor’s metaphoric kaleidoscope, reconfigures what passes through it. The dream of representational translucency might be lost forever, but Carroll finds in form the possibility of a prismatic luminosity.</p>

         <title>3. Recovering the Poet’s Halo</title>
         <p>In <italic>The Meaning of Truth</italic> (1904) William James characterized the epistemology of the prior century thus: <disp-quote>
               <p>Up to about 1850 almost everyone believed that sciences expressed truths that were exact copies of a definite code of non-human realities…. But … in these latter days…. there are so many geometries, so many logics, so many physical and chemical hypotheses, so many classifications, each one of them good for so much yet not good for everything, that the notion that even the truest formula may be a human device and not a literal transcript has dawned upon us. We hear scientific laws now treated as so much “conceptual shorthand,” true so far as they are useful but no farther.<sup>33</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> Of necessity, knowledge and truth come to mean something different under this new representational regime: “our mind has become tolerant of symbol instead of reproduction.”<sup>34</sup> Herbert Spencer, in his <italic>Principles of Psychology</italic> (1873), explains how the diffusion of the precepts of symbolic logic helped to produce this new tolerance: “Logic on the one hand, and the theory of Reasoning on the other, deal with relations from which all concrete terms are, as far as possible, expelled. They are severally obliged to use some terms (which, however, are <italic>by preference symbolic</italic>, so that they may express indifferently any kind of existence, attribute, action, or even relation).”<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As Spencer’s use of the word “preference” suggests, for many late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century writers the new logic did more than make the “conceptual shorthand” of modern symbolism tolerable; it invested symbolism with a prestige it had not enjoyed since Coleridge had linked the symbol to divine authority. A history of symbolic logic written in the first decades of the twentieth century celebrates the power of “improved methods of notation” to reanimate the “old subject” of logic, “which ha[d] been comparatively stagnant for centuries,” enabling it to achieve more in “four decades” than in “any preceding four centuries since Aristotle.”<sup>36</sup> In those same decades, moreover, the logic that had originally been inspired by mathematical symbols would be turned back upon math itself, transforming it in turn. Bertrand Russell opens his 1929 essay “Mathematics and the Metaphysicians” with the remark that the “nineteenth century, which prided itself upon the invention of steam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to fame” from Boole’s “discovery of pure mathematics.” This purity and the representational precision it implies are predicated on the absence of content, an absence that is, for Russell, the salient feature not just of mathematical logic but of all mathematics. Insistent that mathematics no longer be considered a science of quantities or spaces, he quips, “mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.” At the same time, Russell was so confident of the revelatory power of the symbolic language established by Boole and refined by Peano that he not only used it to undertake the ambitious task of proving the consistency of mathematics in his monumental <italic>Principia Mathematica</italic> but also proclaimed that Leibniz’s dream of “a solution of all problems” had “become sober fact.”<sup>37</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Indeed, because symbolic logic offered an “auspicious mode of representation,”<sup>38</sup> its principles came to dominate even accounts of ordinary language. In the early years of the twentieth century, T. S. Eliot would praise Russell for helping to make English a language “in which it is possible to think clearly and exactly on any subject. The <italic>Principia Mathematica</italic> are perhaps a greater contribution to our language than they are to mathematics.”<sup>39</sup> Already in the late nineteenth century, John Henry Newman would understand the workings of language in formal logical terms despite the appeal of the incarnational Coleridgean model to a man of faith. Newman readily granted that the “mathematical calculus of modern times, which has so wonderfully extended the limits of abstract science,” was “best conducted by means of symbols, A, B, and C” and that its votaries strove to make all words, including those in everyday usage, “as little as possible the tokens of real things.”<sup>40</sup> For Newman himself, such “stripped” and “drained” symbols were mere “ghosts,” and he consistently opposed the sensory images provided by experience to the merely notional, abstract apprehension facilitated by the “technical apparatus of words.”<sup>41</sup> But Newman’s mistrust of language was not the norm among thinkers at the end of the century, and ultimately symbolic logic would provide grounds for the development of the twentieth-century philosophy of language when Russell and Frege, along with G. E. Moore, would initiate the tradition of analytic philosophy, with its focus on the analysis of language as a means to answer longstanding philosophical questions.<sup>42</sup> If Newman lamented the fact that the “purifying” impulse of contemporary logic made it difficult to conceive of even ordinary language as rich in referential content, for many of his contemporaries and successors the study of linguistic propositions and their limitations was central to any effort to “[see] the world rightly.”<sup>43</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In its emphasis on associative networks and the power of those networks to conjure ultimate truths, symbolic logic would even find echoes in literary symbolism and early modernism. In <italic>The Symbolist Movement in Literature</italic> (1899), Arthur Symons remarks that “what distinguishes the Symbolism of our day from the Symbolism of the past is that it has now become conscious of itself.” Self-conscious indeed: Symons acknowledges from the outset that the symbol is “essentially but arbitrary, until it has obtained the force of a convention.”<sup>44</sup> The organic Coleridgean symbol was a fantasy whose time had passed, and Symons describes a set of mid-century French writers who, like symbolic logicians, responded to this loss by elaborating form for the purposes of precision.<sup>45</sup> The symbolists of the end of the century would go further, producing sign systems that acknowledged their origin in subjective mental life even as they aspired to be comprehensive in spirit. These were sign systems that emphasized interconnection and combination; in Marshall Olds’s words, for the symbolist poet “the physical universe … is a kind of language that invites a privileged spectator to decipher it, although this does not yield a single message so much as a superior network of associations.”<sup>46</sup> The symbolic systems laid out in this poetry were a far cry from the Coleridgean ideal of the biblical symbol; one is reminded of Charles Baudelaire’s poet in <italic>Paris Spleen</italic>, dropping his halo in a chaotic modern boulevard, and sardonically noting how amusing it would be if it were picked up by a bad (and mathematically labeled) poet: “‘Think of X! Think of Z!’”<sup>47</sup> But for the English at least symbolic logic had helped to relocate the value of the symbol—the divinely sanctioned sign—in symbolism, Boole’s idealized “perfect,” “beautiful,” and “harmonious” sign system. <sup>48</sup> Sullied halos notwithstanding, Symons informs his English audience that symbolist poetry functions as “a kind of religion, with all the duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual.”<sup>49</sup> Certainly, Sylvie’s “commutative” locket, which Bruno kisses and Sylvie compares to “‘God’s own sky,’” has a sacral function, and provides the climactic transfiguration of the novel’s final chapter, “Life out of Death” (<italic>SBC</italic>, p. 823). Baudelaire’s poet remarks that “every cloud has a silver lining”; ultimately, while the bad poets X and Z might not have redeemed representation, the symbols <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> might have.<sup>50</sup>
