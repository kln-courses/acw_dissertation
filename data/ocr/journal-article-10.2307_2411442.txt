<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECIATION IN THE SEA Edited by J. P. Harding and Norman Tebble. Systematic Association Publica- tion Number 5, London, 1963, 199 pp., Paper Bound, 12 shillings, 6 pence or $2.00, postpaid. The Systematics Association, founded in 1937 as the Association for the study of Systematics in relation to General Biology, has objectives similar to those of the So- ciety of Systematic Zoology but is con- cerned equally with the systematics of plants and animals. Membership is mainly from Great Britain but is not confined to that country. Though its early growth was impeded by World War II, since 1945 the Association has increased markedly in membership and has been extremely ac- tive. In particular, for more than a decade the Association has sponsored symposia in London or other major British centers of learning. At intervals, the Systematics As- sociation publishes one of these symposia. Publication 5, released last year, is typical of the series in that it is the result of a symposium held jointly with the Chal- lenger Society at Plymouth Laboratory, September 27-29, 1961. An account of the meeting itself appeared in Nature, Volume 193, 1962. With this fifth volume, the Systematics Association has continued its tradition. If anything, the members have outdone them- selves in producing a book within one year of the previous one, rather than after the normal three-year interval, and further, they have significantly increased the num-</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW S __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _55 ber of pages without increasing the cost. Externally, the book varies from the other four in having a slightly different shade of green paper for the cover; internally, the book holds to the high standards pre- viously established. Although the expres- sions are shopworn, trite, and hoary with age, one must again say that this book is "a must" and "should be in every system- atist's library." The thirteen essays in this collection in- clude four by persons residing outside of Great Britain, a larger proportion than in any of the other Association publications. The papers run the gamut of subject mat- ter from marine algae to deep-sea verte- brates, but all emphasize the point that barriers do exist among populations of organisms residing in the sea. In such a collection of papers, each per- son must judge what seems to him to be the outstanding paper. The reviewer found "Barriers and speciation in lugworms," by C. P. Wells, of special interest. Admittedly, this may be partly the lure of the unknown. To the paleontologist, soft-bodied crea- tures and their habits are virtually un- known entities, and the lure of the un- known is a well-known human character- istic. Discounting this favorable bias, one cannot help but be impressed with Wells' lucid account of the ecology and functional morphology of these animals. This is fol- lowed by his well-documented description of species groups within the lugworms, the groups apparently being separated by tem- perature barriers. Both J. H. Day's remarks on "The com- plexity of the biotic environment" and V. Fretter and A. Graham's contribution on "The origin of species in littoral proso- branchs" are excellent and provide much food for speculation. G. A. Knox draws on several New Zealand intertidal animals to show that the present-day distribution of species is the outcome of shifting of the provincial boundaries and water masses during the Cenozoic. A paper on Fucus by H. T. Powell and one on the marine Rho- dophyta by Peter S. Dixon complete the review of speciation problems among shore- based organisms. Four papers-"CGeographical variation in Limacina helicina in North Pacific," by John A. McGowan; "Some aspects of speci- ation in the Chaetognatha," by D. M. Da- vid; "Speciation in marine phytoplankton," by T. J. Hart; and "Ecological differentia- tion in the plankton of the waters around tbe British Isles" by J. M. Colebrook and G. A. Robinson-all deal in one way or another with water masses. One is left with the impression that for these tiny organisms slight differences in salinity, temperature, or direction of movement constitute almost insurmountable barriers. The information given in the last paper is taken mainly from the results of the Con- tinuous Plankton Recorder, a data gather- ing device which certainly should be more widely used in other oceanic areas. The last two papers on shallow-water fishes by Richard H. Rosenblatt and deep- sea fishes by N. B. Marshall are both clear summaries of their respective fields. Taken together they emphasize the profound dif- ferences in these two environments and the different breeding mechanisms which have arisen to compensate for the harsh- ness of living conditions. The summary by C. F. A. Pantin notes that part of the difficulty in finding bar- riers among organisms as strikingly dif- ferent from ourselves as planktonic dia- toms may be an anthropomorphic outlook. He indicates that the physical factors of the marine environment are subtle and that our knowledge of their effects on physiological limits is still in its early stages, even for so obvious a factor as temperature. Pantin concludes that there is a great need for physical and biological study of oceanic dynamic boundaries, for physiological studies of organisms in rela- tion to the marine environment, and, fi- nally, for taxonomic description of animals and plants in that environment. He com- ments on the last point, "In biology, . . . the first essential is to know what you are talking about."</page><page sequence="3">56 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY It seems appropriate here to comment briefly on the four earlier publications of the Systematics Association, for those who have not had the opportunity to read them. Publication number 1, "Bibliography of Key Works for the Identification of the British Fauna and Flora" (1953), edited by John Smart and George Taylor, con- tains 126 pages. This is the second edi- tion, the first having been issued in 1942. Although one would expect this work to be provincial in aspect, many of the refer- ences are extremely useful for biotas in other parts of the world and as a review of the principal features of a group; all re- ferences are briefly annotated. Publication 2, "The Species Concept in Palaeontology" (1956), is edited by P. C. Sylvester-Bradley. In contains an index, a three-page glossary, and 137 pages of text. Of the seventeen authors contribut- ing to this symposium, all but one reside in the British Isles. The papers collectively express fairly well the relationship of the paleontologically oriented systematist to his neontological colleagues. Publication 3, "Functional Taxonomic Importance" (1959), is edited by A. J. Cain. The 140 pages are divided among ten authors, again all British based. The edi- tor has been particularly successful here with internal organization in dividing this diverse series of essays into three sec- tions dealing with "Theory," "Successes," and "Difficulties." Though five papers dealing with "difficult" problems occupy nearly half the book, this simply serves to add spice to this particularly exciting field. Publication 4, "Taxonomy and Geog- raphy" (1962), is edited by David Nicols. Its 158 pages contain eight papers by English authors and a foreword by Profes- sor Carl Lindroth of Lund, Sweden. This is the first of the publications to contain a plate of photographs and the first to in- clude two botanical papers along with zoological articles. The subject is so broad that the attempt to draw examples from both the plant and animal kingdoms does not provide enough common ground for the reader. The papers, while interesting, accordingly do not seem to follow the central theme as closely as they do in the preceding two publications. Each publication is well worth the low price. They can be obtained from: The Honorary Treasurer Systematics Association c/o British Museum (Natural History) Cromwell Road London SW7, England Payment by draft on an English bank or by International Money Order is pre- ferred by the Association. The Systematic Association was also re- sponsible for The New Systematics (1940), edited by Julian Huxley. Just to round out their publication record, one may note the following summaries: Systematic Association Committee for Descriptive Terminology, by A. W. Exell (Taxon, 9:245-257, 1960) Multivariate Methods in Taxonomy, by W. T. Williams and J. M. Lam- bert (Taxon, 10:205-211, 1961) The Systematics of Man, by Bemard Campbell (Nature, 194: 225-232,1962) Place of Taxonomy in the Teaching of Biology, by G. J. Kerrich (Nature, 198:346-348, 1963) It is to be hoped that these interesting short papers will shortly give rise to fur- ther publications of the Association. ELLIS L.
