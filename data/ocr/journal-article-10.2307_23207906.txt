<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A STRUCTURALIST ANALYSIS OF BAROQUE ART David Carrier The reason for invoking the structuralist field is essentially historical. Something occurs in the historical succession, which upsets the fundamental binary and needs to be ex plained. —Rosalind Krauss In one recent essay, I discussed two repre sentations in contemporary Neapolitan paint ing of Masaniello's 1647 revolt.1 I asked why these history paintings showing con temporary events were made. In another, even more recent commentary, I analyzed Saint Mark Preaching in Alexandria (1504 1507), an enormous painting by Gentile Bellini, completed after his death by his brother, Giovanni.2 I considered the impli cations of setting a saint in the Islamic world. These two essays deal with individual pic tures. In this, the third and final installment of my trilogy, building upon these results, I will argue that a novel conceptual frame work offers a suggestive way of considering these pictures, thus causing the rethinking of the nature of Baroque art. A few decades ago, two scholars indepen dently developed structuralist theories of art. In "The Art World," Arthur Danto presented a style matrix. Let us list, he proposed, the relevant qualities of a work of art—say, A, B, C. (The list could be arbitrarily long. This is just an example.) We then can map out all artworks according to whether they possess these qualities. If there are these three qualities, then there are eight possible works of art: Quality A Quality B Quality C 1 + + + 2 + + 4 + 5 - - + s Danto had "a kind of political vision that all works of art were equal, in the sense that each artwork had the same number of stylis tic qualities as any other."3 A Baroque altar piece and a minimalist sculpture could thus be juxtaposed using this ahistorical approach. Some years later, Rosalind Krauss inde pendently developed a structuralist analysis in her "Sculpture in the Expanded Field" (1978). While Danto's concerns were philosophical, hers were art-historical, for her goal was to map out the postmodernism of Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson, and the other artists of that generation. Rejecting the claim that appeal to precedents would help us understand the radically original minimalism and earth art, Krauss laid out a structure relating this art to landscape and architecture. Traditionally, sculpture is defined as not landscape and not architecture: Not landscape Not architecture Sculpture In postmodernism, as this structure gets filled in, other options become possible.</page><page sequence="2">33 Landscape Site construction Architecture his chart. Danto himself came to think that this structuralist analysis was inconsistent with his interest in the history of art and his much discussed claim that this history has ended.7 Krauss's analysis attracted attention. But then, whether because her interests shifted or because art historians found her terminology forbiddingly technical or, per haps, because these diagrams were associ ated with unconvincing metaphysics, this analysis was not developed.8 Marked sites Axiomatic structures Not landscape Not architecture Sculpture Writing as an analytical philosopher, Danto presented his logical analysis without any elaborate methodological assumptions. Krauss borrowed her way of thinking from Algirdas Greimas, whose structuralism attracted at tention in this country thanks, in large part, to Fredric Jameson, who, in turn, presented it in The Prison-House of Language (1972) and then, in The Political Unconscious (1981), suggestively employed Greimas's diagrams.4 Claude Levi-Strauss, whose anthropology attracted attention, was interested in cultures that did not evolve. In undermining the cus tomary distinction between diachronic—that is, historical—and synchronic analysis, Grei mas in effect treated all societies in anthro pologists' terms.5 For literary scholars, struc turalism offered a way to translate temporal narrative accounts into visual diagrams. Greimas "postulate[d] a level of thought prior to language, in which these rudimentary op positions are given anthropomorphic shape."6 He claimed to be describing the structure of the world, like a metaphysician. Extending logic to describe the world's structure would turn interpretation into a kind of science, ef facing the usual distinctions between the humanities and the social sciences. Neither Danto nor Krauss nor their follow ers developed these structuralist ways of thinking. Philosophers focused attention on Danto's account of Andy Warhol's Brillo Box (1964) but did not pay much attention to Here, I am not concerned with the dif ferences between these ways of formulating a structuralist analysis, but with the implica tions of their shared way of looking at history for study of the Baroque. Like Danto, I present structuralism without making any metaphysical assumptions. But where he is interested in an ahistorical essentialist definition of art, I follow Krauss in using structuralism to understand changes in artistic styles at a particular historical mo ment. Greimas diagrams may not reveal the nature of the world, but they do provide marvelously suggestive ways to interpret art. When, for example, we identify Caravaggio as the opposite of Poussin, we do not speak in logicians' terms.9 Caravaggio might never have existed, and Poussin could have painted differently. And so our account, unlike that of a logician, presents a merely contingent history. These diagrams are a heuristic device, allowing us to better see works of art.10 We do not claim to describe Baroque art as seen within that culture. But this is not to say that our analysis is merely subjective. The goal is to help us see the pictures better, as they really are, by presenting convincing visual comparisons. In that way, our analysis is objective. Let us begin by considering three catego ries relevant to the Baroque. History paintings show the distant past, scenes from classical</page><page sequence="3">34 antiquity or rrom sacred Christian Scripture. The opposite—what we will call genre paintings—show events of the immediate present. Second, paintings may show their subject from a distance or close up. Third, paintings may be site-specific or, conversely, movable—what we will call easel paintings. Following Danto, our three categories, then, yield eight options in this style matrix: painting. Two categories, finally, are not options within Baroque art: number 6, a close up, site-specific genre painting, and number 7, a genre easel painting from far away. History/ tar/ bite-specific/ Not History Not tar Not bite-specific 1 + + - 2 + - + 3 - + 4 + + + 5 + 6 - - + 7 - + + 8 The first of these options is realized by Poussin's history paintings, easel paintings that show events of the distant past from far away. The second is found in Caravaggio's site-specific pictures such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, history paintings that present events from close up." The third appears in the two paintings examined in the first essay of my trilogy, Micco Spadaro's Revolt of Masaniello and Michelangelo Cerquozzi's picture with the same title. They present contemporary events, treated with all of the dignity of traditional historical themes, in easel paintings. The fourth option is realized by quadratura on ceilings, illusionistic archi tectural, site-specific paintings, history scenes shown from far away.12 Pietro da Cortona's fresco in the Palazzo Barberini, Rome, is a prominent example. The fifth option is exem plified by the many Caravaggios that are not site-specific. Option 8, the close-up easel genre painting, is exemplified by still-life We may then translate this style matrix into a Greimas diagram: Genre painting Site-specihc Not site-specific rar Not far History painting Our suggestive diagram allows us to bring together three novel seventeenth-century de velopments that otherwise appear to be dis tinct: Caravaggio's highly influential presen tation of historical events from close up; Spadaro's and Cerquozzi's development of history paintings of contemporary political events; and the quadratura. Earlier partial precedents can be cited for these three art forms.13 But they become fully developed only in the seventeenth century, which thus roughly breaks with the Renaissance, in the same way that minimalist postmodernism de fines a rupture with modernism (as Krauss claims). Poussin, as it is often said, believed that Caravaggio was born to destroy paint ing.14 Where Poussin shows us historically and visually distant scenes, Caravaggio gets close up—"in our face," as it were—in the style of a realist film director. In his later art, Caravaggio, like Poussin a history painter, shows sacred subjects. Spadaro and Cerquoz zi, by contrast, present contemporary events from a physical distance. And, finally, the ceilings of Pietro da Cortona show sacred events from far away. Here, then, we have a picture of the options open within the Baroque. In a letter</page><page sequence="4">35 mentioning the execution of Charles I in England, Masaniello's revolt in Naples, and the political unrest in Poland, Poussin writes: "It is a great pleasure to live in a century in which such great events take place, providing that one can take shelter in some little corner and watch the play in comfort."1' He was not a political painter, but his apolitical images are one option within the Baroque; another option was political painting. The aim of these dia grams, Krauss observes, is to describe his torical breaks. Here we show the novel pos sibilities created within the Baroque. Mark Preaching in Alexandria (1504-1507). And the anonymous Venetian painting The Reception of the Venetian Ambassadors in Damascus (1511) is an eyewitness image of the Islamic world.16 Spadaro and Cerquozzi do not depict Muslims. But the Spanish rulers of Naples were much concerned about con taining Islam. They faced threats of piracy and invasion. Just before Masaniello's revolt, a mock battle was staged using men with blackened faces and dressed as Moors.17 The ongoing struggle against the Ottoman Em pire, which created insoluble taxation prob lems, played a major role in bringing about Masaniello's revolt. So even though Mus lims are not represented in our political paint ings, they were not out of the picture. And al though Poussin did not depict the exotic Muslim world in his paintings, he worked within a cultural context in which Islam was present. We have displayed the period style of Baroque art, showing the various options. But we may also employ them to present the larger history. Let us add a fourth category to our chart and consider very briefly just one of the sixteen possible options: History/ Far/ Site-specific/ Islam/ Not History Not Far Not Site-specific Not Islam + + - + All of our earlier examples were paintings that did not show Islam. But there are some Renaissance examples that do, and so they can be added to our style matrix. Muslims are shown in Gentile and Giovanni Bellini's Saint This essay is for Rosalind Krauss.

From his very different perspective, Richard Wollheim anticipated this approach when he proposed to understand Courbet's Le Sommeil (1866) by look ing to the sleeping man in Poussin's Rinaldo and Armida (1626): "Where have I seen this face before? . . . [An] answer of surprising precision, comes into consciousness.... We have seen this very face in ... Courbet.... We cannot use this as evidence for, but we might use this as a guide to what, freed from prior con viction, the young knight's features show us." His goal is to identify suggestive visual parallels.

To understand why it is not, still, outside the frame of his paintings, we must recover his concept of representation."
