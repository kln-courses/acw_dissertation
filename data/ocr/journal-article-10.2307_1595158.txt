<plain_text><page sequence="1">REI GIOUS INFLUENCES ON MEDIEVAL ARABIC PHILOLOGY The all-important position which religion held in the spiritual life of medieval Muslim society made itself felt in almost every sphere of cultural activity. Quotations from the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet pervade all branches of Arabic literature, and, just as in medieval Europe, Muslim scientists and scholars felt bound, or were forced by circumstances, to adjust their theories to religious teachings (1). On this background alone it would be fairly safe to assume religious influences on Arabic philology too (2), all the more so as Qur'an and Hadith, and especially the former, played a prominent part as sources of Arabic grammar and lexicogra- phy (3). There also existed a close professional relationship between philology and the religious disciplines: since the Holy Scriptures of Islam are composed in Arabic, it was constantly stressed that a through knowledge of this language, both practi- cal and theoretical, was indispensable for a Muslim theologian, and, on the other hand, Arab philologists often prided themselves (1) Cf. M. Plessner, Die Geschichte der Wissenschaften im Islam, Tubingen 1931, 21. (2) I have not been able to use for the present paper Goldziher's Beitrage zur Geschichte der Sprachgelehrsamkeil bei den Arabern (Sitzungsber. der phil.-hist. Classe d. kais. Akad. d. Wiss., LXXII, 1872, 587-631). (3) Although the Hadlth was declared unfit for grammatical research in the first centuries of Islam, lexicography drew on it extensively from the very outset, since its aim was not so much to establish linguistic norms as to explain the language and especially the classics of Arabic literature. 3</page><page sequence="2">on the important service that their professional activity rendered to religious sciences. This fact, probably, led to the belief, expressed in Arabic tradition as well as by modern scholars, that Arabic philology had come into existence as a means for the interpretation and the correct reading of the Holy Scriptures of Islam (1). Although this view, for reasons that cannot be set forth here in detail, must be considered wrong or at least one-sided, it nevertheless proves, as far as Arabic tradition is concerned, that the consideration of religious influence on philology was deeply rooted in the thinking of the Muslims. I Arabic tradition, indeed, has preserved certain information suggesting that already some of the earliest philologists were influenced in their professional activity by religious motives. Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' (ca. 689-770) and Abu 'Amr al-Shaibani (died 821), for example, had their doubts whether the collecting of ancient poetry and sayings of the Bedouins was compatible with the duty incumbent upon every educated Muslim to devote himself to the study of religious literature. Abl 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' is reported to have burnt, in a fit of piety, the whole of his large collection of philological notes, in order to devote himself entirely to the study of the Qur'an. When he again took up his philological activity, he had to rely entirely upon his memory (2). Abi 'Amr al-Shaibant's main occupation was collecting the dlwans of the various Arab tribes. It is related that he used to copy the Qur'an and to deposit the manuscript in the mosque of Kufa, whenever he had finished the diwan of any one tribe (3). This account obviously implies that he did so in order to expiate the sin of having devoted his time to a wordly pursuit.

KOPF</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY A parallel to al-Shaibani's behaviour is found in the following report about al-Zajjajl (died 949) : When writing, in Mekka, his grammatical work K. al-jumal he stopped after each chapter and spent a week making the lawdf and begging God to forgive him and to render his book profitable to its reader (1). Even though the authenticity of these anecdotes might be doubted, they well illustrate a trend in early Muslim society (2) the implications of which, for our subject, will soon be seen. With al-Asma'i, the most famous of early Arab philologists, we stand on more solid ground. He refused, according to the traditional view, to explain any word in the Qur'an or the Hadlth (3), and also refrained from touching upon the subject of the anwd' (stars foreboding rain) - a theme that is very often alluded to in ancient poetry - because of its connection with religious notions of the Jdhiltya (4). Likewise, seemingly on religious grounds too, did he refuse to explain satiric poetry (hija') (5). The report that al-Asma'i refused to explain words in the Qur'an and the Hadith needs comment, as some of his writings and teachings would necessarily have involved him in the explanation of such expressions : he was the author of a K. lughdt al-qur'dn (6) (a dictionary of Qur'anic words, not, as such titles are commonly understood, a glossary of dialect expres- sions occurring in the Qur'an), he added critical annotations to the K. majaz al-qur'an of Abu 'Ubaida (7), and Abii 'Ubaid transmitted from him explanations of words in the Hadith (8). Neither the assumption of Ahlwardt (9) that the attitude ascribed to al-Asma'I was due to his anxiety to keep aloof (1) al-DamIri, s. v. aiyil. (2) Aba 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' had a predecessor in Khalaf al-Ahn.ar of whom it is reported that he ceased to compose poetry after having become pious and applying himself to the reading of the Qur'an every day.

(9) ElaCma'iiiat, xix. 35</page><page sequence="4">from theological controversies, nor that of Brockelmann and Goldziher (1) who attributed such behaviour to the philologist's extreme piety, can sufficiently explain the evident discrepancy. The earliest evidence concerning al-AsmaTi's refusal to explain words occurring in the religious literature of Islam stems from his pupil Abu Hatim and from Abui Htim's pupil, al-Mubarrad (died 898) (2). This last reports: ( Al-Asma'i used not to explain any poetry the interpretation of which would have involved some Qur'anic saying ,. When asked to expound a certain verse of al-Shammakh he declined to explain the expres- sion 'indn al-shi'rayain which occurs in it because of its connec- tion with al-shi'ra, Sira 53, 49. Abu Hatim reports another instance : al-Asma'l declined to confirm that ribba was used in the sense of (( a group of persons ) because of the Qur'anic verse (Sira 31,46) : ((How many a prophet has there been along with whom many ribbiyun fought ). Here al-Asma'i insinuated that it was possible to derive the meaning of the word from rabb = God. The narrower definition given by al-Mubarrad qualifies in an interesting way the general statement that al-Asma'i did not explain the vocabulary of the Holy Scriptures. In view of the fact that he was the author of a small dictionary of Qur'anic words and that he also otherwise treated expressions occurring in Qur'an and Hadith, we may infer from al-Mubarrad's account, even though the two available examples hardly bear out such a conclusion, that he only tried to avoid interfering with tradi- tional exegesis. He seems to have held, in conformity with the view of certain circles of professional theologians, that the Holy Scriptures, and especially the Qur'an, could not be explai- ned by purely philological means and methods and to have feared to imply non-traditional and, perhaps, unorthodox interpretations of certain passages in Qur'an and Hadith (3) if he explained corresponding or related expressions in profane literature with a philologist's knowledge of the language or according to the requirements of the context. (1) Richtungen, 57; Abhandlungen I, 136. (2) Muzhir II, 325 f. (3) This conclusion is supported by the account in Ta'rikh Baghdad XIII, 255. 36 L. KO PF</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY It is to be supposed, therefore, that in his pertinent writings and teachings al-Asma'I represented strictly traditional and orthodox exegesis. This is corroborated by the fact that he criticised Abi 'Ubaida's Majdz al-qur'an by saying that the assumption of metaphorical expressions in the Qur'an was tantamount to an arbitrary interpretation of God's word (1). We thus see that the method of interpreting the Qur'an with the help of philological means, already initiated, according to tradition, by 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas (2), did not find general acceptance even in philologist circles of ancient times. Actual- ly, there always existed, at least on the part of the theologians, some resistance to such exegetical procedure. From the first centuries of Islam it is reported that certain philologists who dared to voice independent explanations of Qur'anic words were sharply rebuked by the theologians. The famous al- Tabari who probably was the first commentator of the Qur'an to make extensive use of philological means for consolidating Qur'anic exegesis, nevertheless restricted the application of this method by the principle that the results thus obtained should not contradict authoritative traditional interpreta- tions (3). In the 7th century A. H. Nizam al-Din al-Naisaburi empha- sized in his K. ghara'ib al-qur'dn that the Holy Book cannot be explained with the help of other literary sources (4). Al-AsmaTi's disinclination to expound Qur'anic words with a specialist's knowledge of the language and with philological methods was shared by some later lexicologists, who did not dare to go beyond the traditional interpretations transmitted from the oldest times of Islam. Such, for instance, was the attitude of Ibn Duraid (837-933) who, in his Jamharat al-lugha, , gives frequently explanations of verses of the Qur'an, always on the authority of the Basrian grammarian Abu 'Ubaida, but in a quaint way he states at times that he will rather not (1) Goldziher, Muh. St. II, 402. (2) Goldziher, Richtungen, 69 ff. (3) Ibid. (4) On the margin of al-TabarI's Tafsir I, Bfilq 1323, 6. 37</page><page sequence="6">tell us the interpretation of the former , (1). Some examples of this kind are assembled in al-Suyiiti's Muzhir (2); one of them indicates that his scruples also extended to independent interpretation of the HIadith. What Ibn Duraid so anxiously avoided quoting were most probably explanations which had no backing in traditional exegesis. Abii 'Ubaida is indeed reported to have deviated in several cases from the traditional path and suggested inter- pretations of his own. The theologians' attitude, to which also philologists readily bowed, leads us to an understanding of the fact that, in indi- genous Arabic dictionaries, we find so many unwarranted explanations of Qur'anic and Hadith words originating in traditional and even sectarian exegesis (see below, section VII). Lexicographers could not easily dismiss even doubtlessly mista- ken interpretations or replace them by better ones which they might have been able to establish with the professional means at their disposal. Some authors of dictionaries expressly state that, with respect to the vocabulary of Qur'an and Hadith, they strictly adhere to the statements of the recognised autho- rities in these fields. II Arabic lexicography, soon after its inception, gradually developed into a traditionary discipline to which the principles of the science of Hadith came to be applied (3). Religious factors are said to have been brought into play, when it was intended to establish the reliability of the ((transmitters of the language. Al-Suyiuti states that the lexicological tradi- tions of libertines were rejected (4) and this statement seems to have been no mere theory. Al-Azhari, for example, imme- diately after relating that Niftawaihi had not considered Ibn (1) Krenkow, in Cent. Supp!. of the JRAS 1924, 264. (2) II, 327 f.

KOPF</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY Duraid a reliable authority, reports that, once visiting the latter in his home, he had found him so drunken that he was unable to speak properly (1). It was seemingly this fact which induced al-AzharI to caution his readers against relying upon those of Ibn Duraid's lexicographic data which were not confir- med by other authorities. It must, however, be assumed that such an attitude was far from representing a general trend in Arabic lexicography. Al-Tibrlzi, for example, was declared reliable in spite of his being a drunkard (2). Tradition has it that religious considerations also influenced the choice of poets whose verses were to be taken as shawdhid. It is reported that the verses of Umaiya ibn Abi 'I-Salt were neglected by the philologists, because the poet had employed abstruse divine names (3). This statement, however, can be true only for a minority of philologists, since Umaiya's verses are not infrequently adduced in Arabic dictionaries. Ibn Qutaiba even quotes Umaiya in connection with the expla- nation of a Qur'anic word (4). Yunus ibn Habib (died 769 or 798) criticised the language of Ibn Qais al-Ruqaiyat, and when he was reminded that the poet was a native of Hijaz, he had no better reply than to exclaim: How can he have spoken pure Arabic (fasih) and be thought reliable (Ihiqa) having been used, as he was, to drinking wine in Takrit? (5) This tradition is probably intended to purport that a Muslim who drinks wine is no trustworthy authority even in matters of language; although one could also think of a different interpretation. Wine-sellers in those times were non-Arabs, and social intercourse with such people was generally deemed to corrupt the purity of language (6). The poet, then, through his habit of associating with people who spoke Arabic incorrectly could have lost the faculty of chaste speech. Such an interpretation of the tradition would, (1) Op. cit., p. 30. (2) Yaqut, Irshad, VII, 287. (3) GAL I, 27. (4) K. ta'wil mukhtalif al-had[th.

III The field of Arabic philology most strongly influenced by religious considerations was the treatment of loanwords (1). Foreign elements had entered Arabic through various channels already at a very early date, and their existence in the language was never denied. The Qur'an, however, constituted a special problem. Since the teachings of Islam are derived, to a consi- derable extent, from Jewish and Christian sources the Prophet had no choice but to use, in his utterances, in addition to loan- words of older standing, some of the foreign terms by means of which the new ideas had been conveyed to him. Consequently, the Qur'an contains quite a number of non-Arabic words (2) whose foreign character was readily recognised by the earliest exegetes (3). But there soon arose scruples in the minds of pious men who thought it a sacrilege to admit the existence of foreign words in the Holy Book which is expressly stated to have been composed (iin clear Arabic language )) (Sura 26, 195; cf. 4, 33, etc.). This opinion which derived from too narrow an interpretation of the Qur'anic passages (4) was attri- buted to Abi 'Ubaida (728-825), one of the earliest Arab philo- logists. To him the following saying has been ascribed : ((Whoever pretends that there is in the Qur'an anything other than the Arabic tongue, has made a serious charge against (1) Unfortunately, the treatise of A. SiddIql, Ibn Duraid and his treatment of loanwords, Allahabad 1930, could not be used for this section. (2) They have been assembled in A. Jeffery's The foreign vocabuiary of the Qur'an, Baroda 1938.

(4) This point was duly stressed by later scholars who endeavoured to show that admitting the foreign origin of certain Qur'anic words was no heresy at all; see Jeffery, op. cit., 10-11. 40 L. KOPF</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY God ) (1), i. e., he contests the correctness of the Qur'anic passages. Abu 'Ubaida's view must have been common among the philologists of his time and of later generations, since some sources assert that such had been the opinion of philologists in general, whereas, paradoxically, the theologians are said to have held a different view (2). This latter assertion, however, if true at all in this general form, probably refers only to the earliest authorities of Islam; al-Shafi'i already agreed in this respect with Abi 'Ubaida, his older contemporary. The two opposite opinions called for some adjustment. The contention of the earliest exgetes, who enjoyed the highest esteem of later generations, could not be discounted by mere contradiction. The dispute had to be settled by compromise. Al-Shafi'i (767-820) already propounded the view that those Qur'anic words which some considered to be foreign intruders must be of good Arabic stock, as evidenced by certain hints in the Qur'an itself, although they were not, or no more, gene- rally known at the rise of Islam. The vocabulary of the Arabic language is so copious that no one can encompass it except a prophet; but the full knowledge of it is always present with the speech-community as a whole, the different groups comple- menting each other. Those who speak of foreign words in the Qur'an can mean only that a part of the Qur'anic vocabulary was unknown to a particular group of Arabs (obviously those who were closely connected with the revelation and the earliest interpretation of the Qur'an) (3). Al-Shafi'i's contemporary ,the famous philologist Abu 'Ubaid (770-837), took a more rationalist line (4). He thought to settle the dispute through a sophistical definition of the term ( loanword ). Readily admitting that words of foreign origin were to be found in the Qur'an he claimed that these had been (1) Al-JawalIql, op. cit., 4. (2) See, e. g., Ibn Faris, al-Sdhibi, Cairo 1910, 29. (3) al-Risala, ed. A. M. Shakir, Cairo 1940, 40 ff. See also below, section IX. (4) His theory is sometimes attributed to the already mentioned AbO 'Ubaida but this is obviously due to a scribal error. Both names have often been confounded with each other. 41</page><page sequence="10">accepted into the Arabic language long before Islam and so had become Arabic. Either view about the nature of certain elements in the Qur'anic vocabulary is essentially correct. Both of them need only a slight qualification : the words in question are foreign as regards their origin; they are Arabic with respect to the fact that they were used or at least under- stood by the Arabs of Qur'anic times. Abu 'Ubaid explicitly pointed out that it had been his intention to vindicate the attitude adopted by the earliest exegetes (1). Al-Tabari (839-923), the author of the well-known commen- tary on the Qur'an, approached the problem from another angle. He evidently knew that certain Qur'anic words existed in other languages too (2), but, being more strongly biased theo- logically than Abi 'Ubaid, probably found no full satisfaction in the solution proposed by him. He advocated the theory that the so-called foreign elements are to be reduced to an incidental similarity between the respective Arabic words and the corresponding ones employed by other nations. Every Qur'anic expression is purely Arabic, the common words having existed in different languages from time immemorial. Instead of claiming, as was done by some (3), that ((in the Qur'an there is something of every language ), he preferred to say that ( there is in it something of every language which has words in common with Arabic)) (4). Al-Tabari seemingly was the first who clearly set out this theory, but it cannot be claimed that he was its actual inaugu- rator. According to a tradition transmitted by Ibn Qutaiba (5) the same compromising view had already been held by Ibn 'Abbas . This tradition, however, deserves no special credence, (1) See e. g., Ibn Faris, op. cit., 29. Jeffery, op. cit., 10 f., presents Abi 'Ubaid's theory on the authority of much later writers who elaborated it in several respects. Cf. al-JawalIqI, op. cit., editor's introduction, 11. (2) Being of Iranian extraction he must have been struck at least by the Qur'anic words of Persian origin. (3) Probably in order to bear out the view that Arabic was the most encompas- sing of languages; cf. below. (4) Tafstr I, Bulaq 1323, 6 ff. (5) See Siddiqi, op. cit., 13. 42 L. KOPF</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY as it contradicts the apparently well-founded view that the earliest commentators of the Qur'an readily recognised the existence of foreign words in the revelation; and here most of the reported examples of this view are attributed to none other but Ibn 'Abbas. Yet a passage in al-Khalil's dictionary K. al-'ain (1) and some sayings attributed to Abi 'Ubaida (2) indicate that Tabari had not propounded an entirely new idea. A hint to the same effect is given in al-Shafi'i's Risala. The theory advocated by al-Tabari (3) is illustrated by many examples in philological writings. In al-Tha'libi's Fiqh al- lugha there is a small chapter entitled (( Nouns which exist in the same form in both the Arabic and the Persian language ) (4). The author probably intended to assemble in it only the perti- nent Qur'anic words (5). With regard to lannur (it occurs in Suras 11, 40; 23, 27) it was even maintained that it is a word found in every language, in Arabic as well as in all the others (6). Ibn Duraid thought it to be of Persian origin but silenced his religious misgivings by the following consideration : the Arabs do not know any other word for stove, and therefore it occurs in the revelation; for they were addressed in the language they understood (7). Even non-Qur'anic words of foreign origin came to be treated in the light of this theory. In connection with dashl al-Jauhari remarks : It is either Persian or [due to] an incidental similarity between the two languages (8). (1) Baghdad 1914, 5. (2) Muzhir I, 266. Cf. also Goldziher, Muh.

(8) Muzhir I, 267. 43</page><page sequence="12">Jeffery (1) states that, as al-Tabari's line of argument was not likely to commend itself to many of the more instructed Muslim scholars, it was claimed by some that where Arabic agrees with another language, the words in question had originally been borrowed from the Arabic. This statement is based on a saying of 'Azizi b. 'Abd al-Malik (2) which, however, is better interpreted as follows : ( It is because Arabic is the most encom- passing of languages and the richest as to vocabulary that these words are found in it; [but] it is possible that, with regard to them, the Arabs had been preceded [by others] ) (3). There is no other trace of the opinion of which Jeffery speaks. The discussion about the nature of the Qur'anic words in question continued throughout the ages without arriving at a unanimous settlement one way or the other. Ibn Faris (died 1005) agreed in the main with the view of Abu 'Ubaid (4), whilst stressing especially that the Qur'an was free from any non- Arabic element. To the chapter in which he treats the subject he gave the heading: ( On the language in which the Qur'an was revealed, and that in the Book of God there is nothing beside the language of the Arabs ,. He emphasizes that this doctrine is of great religious significance : the non-existence of foreign words in the Qur'an can be adduced against heretics who might claim that the contemporaries of Muhammad were unable to produce anything similar to the Qur'an only because the Prophet had made use of strange words. Still, it should be remembered that Ibn Faris was known as a stout opponent of the Shu'uibtya, whose adherents tried to show how much Arabic owed to the languages of the conquered nations. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that, in denying the existence of foreign words in the Qur'an, Ibn Faris was prompted not only by religious but also by nationalist motives. A remark of al-Azhari (895-980) seems to purport that this (1) Op. cit., 8 f. (2) Al-Suyuti., Itqan I, nau' 38.

KOPF</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY lexicographer, too, had adopted Abu 'Ubaid's view (1). Al- Jawallqi mentions the different opinions in the introduction of his Mu'arrab, without defining there his own attitude; but, to judge from his opening remark : (This is a book in which we mention the foreign words found in the speech of the ancient Arabs and employed in the Glorious Qur'an ), he evidently recognised the foreign origin of certain Qur'anic words. In the following centuries the tendency to do away with religious scruples and readily to recognise the existence of foreign words in the Qur'an seemed to increase in strength. Taj al-Din al-Subki (1327-1370) composed a poem on this subject (2) which was supplemented by others (3), and the poly- math al-Suyiuti (1445-1505) devoted to it several treatises (4), the title of one of which - Al-MutawakkilU, on the Qur'anic words derived from the Abyssinian, Persian, Indian, Turkish, Zinji, Nabataean, Coptic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Berber languages - clearly shows that the author had entirely freed himself from the old fetters. But such a view, up to the present time has never imposed itself on the minds of all educated Muslims. It had categorically been rejected by Fakhr al-Din al-RazI and his followers, on the ground to be sure, of the above-mentioned Qur'anic passages (5). A much later author, IHamza Fath Allah (1850-1918), on the other hand, wrote a Risala fl 'I-kalimdt al-ghair 'arabiya fi 'l-qur'dn al-karim (6), but he is not at all representative of the opinion still current in Muslim circles of our time, who are, ( as a rule, seriously distressed by any discussion of the foreign origin of words in the Qur'an ) (7).

KOPF IV Theologians and philologists were at variance with regard to certain readings of the Qur'an. Some philologists dared to suggest emendations with the intention of eliminating devia- tions from the strict grammatical rules, but their interference was strongly disapproved by the theologians (1) to whose attitude even professional philologists surrendered explicitly. It is reported that al-Mazini (died 863) rejected emending, in accordance with a theory of Sibawaihi, the i'rdb of a certain Qur'anic word, by stating that one is bound to follow the traditional readings (2). V Religious influences can be seen, too, in the discussions about what was to be considered the chastest Arabic. Here, the view eventually prevailed that every Qur'anic expression is ((purer,) than similar non-Qur'anic ones (3). Consequently, the Prophet Muhammad through whose mouth the Qur'an had been revealed was to be considered the chastest of speech among all the Arabs, and the oral traditions originating from him were held to represent the finest Arabic prose (4). Since Muhammad belonged to the tribe of Quraish, it was only natural to confer the title of ((purest Arabic ) upon the dialect of the whole of this tribe(5). Also the tradition that Muhammad had spent his childhood with the tribe of Sa'd was made to fit into the picture, and Quraish had to accept them as equal partners on the highest plane of chasteness of speech (6).

As to the Qur'an itself, some of its readings, even such as are referred to canonic ((readers ), were flatly rejected on philological grounds by early scholars. The form ma'd'ish (pl. of ma'isha), for example, which occurs in the reading of Nafi', was considered incorrect, since the radical y should be preserved also in the plural (1). The reading of Hamza in Sura 41 : ...alladhi tassa'ala]na bihi wal-arhdmi was considered an offence against grammar; where a noun in the genitive case is to be connected with a pronoun attached to a preposition, this preposition, according to the Basrian school, has to be repeated with the noun (2). The majority reading wal-arhdma avoids coming into conflict with this rule. The famous philo- logist al-Mubarrad is reported to have so strongly objected to Hamza's reading that, according to his own words, he would not have prayed with an Imam who adopted it. It is little to be wondered at that the reading of Abi Qilaba al-asharru instead of the common al-ashiru (Sura 54, 26) was rejected as a mere solecism (3); more surprising is the fact, especially in view of the dogmatic opinion referred to above, that al- Akhfash disqualified the reading ild maisurihi instead of ild maisuratin (Sura 2, 280) for the sole reason that a form maf'ul without the feminine ending is not otherwise attested in the language (4). That early philologists did not consider the Qur'anic usage the most authoritative norm of the language can also be seen from another angle. It is reported, for example, that Abu Hatim did not infer from the Qur'anic usage that firdaus is feminine, but explained that the gender was influenced by the synonym janna (5).

Its language, full of slips in reaso- ning and style, is to be considered a rather poor example of Arabic prose, the diction of a man grappling with the problem of formulating ideas new and remote to his countrymen (2). Nevertheless, the dogma which seems to have fully crystal- lised in the 4th century A. H. (3) had a practical influence on the professional activity of the philologists. We can already discern a first indication of this trend in al-Asma'i whose peculiar attitude towards the interpretation of the Qur'an has been pointed out above, Section I. Whereas other philologists of his time, as we have just seen, had no scruples whatsoever in declaring certain Qur'anic word forms inadmissible, al-Asma'i did not dare to doubt the authority of any of the linguistic features occurring in the Qur'an. It is reported that he denied the co-existence of synonymous verb forms of the 1st and 4th conjugation(4); even verses of ancient poetry which showed this feature were not admitted by him as conclusive proofs, since, in his eyes, the language of the ancient poets was not above all criticism. Yet when such double forms occurred in the Qur'an or in one of its various readings, he did not dare to apply here, too, his preconceived theory (5). The linguistic preference over ancient poetry which, in this philologist's opinion, was due to the Qur'an is also manifest in another case. It is reported that he established, on the ground of Qur'5nic usage, that zauj is the only admissible form for (wife ) and rejected a shahid of the well-known Bedouin poet Dhfi 'l-Rumma in which the feminine zauja is used (6). (1) See, e. g., Noldeke, Beitrdge, 11. (2) Noldeke, Neue Beitrdge, 5 ff. (French transl. by G.-H. Bousquet, Remarques critiques sur le style et la syntaxe du Coran, Paris 1953); F.

KOPF</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY In the course of time the tendency to assign preeminence to the Qur'anic usage took on a systematic shape. It came to be maintained that even word forms which do not conform to the morphological norm have to be declared fasi.h, if they occur in the Qur'an (1). In al-Hariri it can often be seen that gramma- tical forms used in the Qur'an are on principle preferred to similar non-Qur'anic ones (2). The assertion that the dialect of Quraish was the purest is contradicted by the theory that those tribes spoke the best Arabic who resided in the remotest parts of the Arabian penin- sula and so had the least contact with members of other speech- communities. According to this theory the pure language was best preserved by those Arabs who lived in geographical seclusion, whereas frequent intercourse with foreigners was deemed to bring about a corruption of the language (3). In the light of this opinion the dialect of the Meccan region should have been considered as unchaste as any Arabic dialect could be, since the merchants of Mecca had ample opportunity to come into contact with people speaking other languages (4). The Quraish, indeed, and the people of Hijaz in general, are not mentioned among the tribes from whom the philologists mostly derived their linguistic knowledge - these were, accor- ding to al-Farabi, Qais, Tamim and Asad (5) -, and in a saying of Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' it is expressly stated that 'Uly5 Hawazin and Sufla Tamim were chastest of speech (6). These statements, it is true, refer to the time of the philo- logists, whereas dogmatic opinion to the contrary obviously (1) Muzhir I, 188. (2) E. g., Durrat al-ghawwds, 129: a One must say correctly suqifa fi yadihl...; usqita, indeed, has also been transmitted from the ancient Arabs, the former, however, is chaster because of the Qur'anic saying..., Accordingly, we read in the Tdj al-'aris (V, 155): c suqita occurs more frequently (a criterion, which was very arbitrarily applied, for establishing the chasteness of word forms) and is better . (3) Muzhir I, 212. The speech-corrupting influence of foreigners is often pointed out in Arabic sources. (4) It is for just this reason that the people of Thaqlf were, by some, excluded from the authorities in matters of language; see Muzhir I, 212. (5) Muzhir I, 211. (6) Muzhir I, 211. 4 49</page><page sequence="18">L. KOPF had in view the linguistic situation - liable to rapid changes - as it was supposed to have been at the rise of Islam. Yet there are other traditions which imply that the dialect of Quraish was not at all considered to represent the highest standard of Arabic even in the earliest time of Islam. For making copies of the Qur'an the Caliph 'Uthman is reported to have recommen- ded people of Hudhail and of Thaqif, the former for dictating the text and the latter as scribes. According to a saying of 'Umar the first-mentioned function could been trusted to youths from Quraish as well as from Thaqif. Also the tradition accor- ding to which the Qur'an was revealed in different dialects can serve to demonstrate that in ancient times no exclusive preference was as yet conferred upon the dialect of Quraish (1). Nevertheless, the dogma of the unsurpassable excellence of the Qur'anic idiom greatly helped to gain supremacy for the view that the dialect of Quraish was the purest and finest, since Muhammad had spoken it (2), and the contradicting traditions were made to harmonise with this view. It was claimed, for example, that the tribes of Qais, Tamim and Asad on whom the philologists mostly relied, had adopted the idiom of Quraish. And ancient poetry was made to fit into the picture by the report, ascribed to Hammad al-Rawiya, that the ancient Arab poets had submitted their verses for linguistic criticism to members of the tribe of Quraish (3). VI In the course of time the dogma seems to have been extended to the Hadith, too, although it was readily admitted by Muslim scholars that the oral traditions had been transmitted not exactly in their original wording but only according to their sense. Their language, therefore, was thought to be influenced by the later traditionists whose knowledge of the 'arablya (1) See Muzhir I, 210 f. (2) This view is still prevalent among modern Arab scholars; see, e. g., Rabin, Ancient West Arabian, 23. (3) Ahlwardt, Bemerkungen uber die Jichtheit der alten arabischen Gedichte, 5.</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY was put to severe doubts by the philologists (1). This was actually the reason why the Hadith had been thought unfit for grammatical investigations during the first centuries of Arabic philology. That it was eventually taken into account by later grammarians (2) can only be understood if we realize that a dogmatic evaluation of its language, disregarding the admitted inexactness of the transmission, was gradually taking place. As I have already mentioned, Arabic lexicography paid full attention to the Hadith from the outset, but it did so mainly from the semantic point of view. As to the morphological aspect of its language, lexicographers often founds faults with the Hadlth which are duly pointed out in the dictionaries, not infrequently as outright controversies between ahl al-lugha and ashdb al-hadilh. Still, the lexicographers' attitude towards the Hadith was not unequivocally defined (3). On the one hand certain forms occurring only in the oral traditions were flatly rejected, while, on the other hand, the Hadith was sometimes relied upon, even by early lexicographers, exactly for establishing the correct form of words. Whether here, as in the case of grammar, full authority was ascribed to the Hadith only in a later period can not be determined with certainty. At any rate there can be no doubt that those philologists who eventually regarded the Hadith as fully authoritative in linguistic matters were greatly helped by dogmatic conside- rations in disregarding the admitted fact that the oral traditions had not been transmitted in their original form. Al-Jahiz already claimed that, with regard to rhetorical (1) Special treatises were devoted to the linguistic errors of the traditionists, e. g. the Tashtfdt al-muhaddithfn of Abf Ahmad al-'AskarI (GAL I2, 132, S I, 193). Their faulty knowledge of the language is stressed in a number of anecdotes; see, e. g., Muzhir II, 294 f. (2) Goldziher, Muh. St. II, 201, 239; Khizanat al-adab I, Cairo 1347, 267. The first grammarian who used the HadIth without restriction was the well-known Ibn Malik (7th century A. H.); others thought it necessary to make a distinction, which, to be sure, could never be actually effected, between the traditions whose wording had been altered and those whose transmission had preserved the original language. (3) See Lane, Lexicon, Preface IX. 51</page><page sequence="20">excellence, nothing, besides the Qur'an itself, can compare with the oral traditions deriving from the Prophet (1). As to the purely linguistic aspect of the Hadith two statements by well-known authorities can be adduced to the effect that there existed a strong tendency dogmatically to declare its language an irreproachable model of the 'arabiya. When al-Nasa'i (830-915) was consulted about the occurrence of solecisms in the Hadith, he gave the following answer : ( If there is something [in it] which was used by the ancient Arabs, even though it is not found in the dialect of Quraish - do not change [it], for the Prophet used to address people in their own language; and if it is something which is not found [at all] in the language of the ancient Arabs, [do not consider it wrong], for the Prophet of Allah did not speak incorrectly)) (2). This statement was obviously directed against the corrective interference of the philologists. With regard to lexicography, al-Qastallani, the commentator of al-Bukhari's Sahih, apodictically stated that the usage of the Prophet is one of the strongest proofs for establishing the meanings of words (3), and so dogmatically justified the attitude assumed by the lexicographers from the earliest times. Certain hadiths could serve as a justification of the well- known tendency of Arab philologists to influence the usage of the language, especially in a prohibitive sense (4). There are a number of traditions put into the mouth of the Prophet and his contemporaries which prohibit or disapprove of the use of some current expressions or intend to restrict the use of certain words to specific applications (5). In most of these traditions, it is true, the normative interference with language was moti- (1) Goldziher, Richtungen, 120 f.; cf. also F.

KOPF</page><page sequence="21">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY vated by religious considerations (1), but the principle, once established in one sphere, could easily be extended to others; and if one assumes that those traditions had been invented on purpose, they were obviously intended to strengthen the hands of the philologists in their tendency to shape the language. VII An indirect influence of religious factors, too, was sustained, with rather far-reaching effects, by Arabic lexicography. It is well known that the traditional interpretation of Qur'an and Hadith, stemming from the earliest time of Islam, ascribes to a considerable number of difficult words meanings that were established by mere guess and whose correctness is subject to severe doubts (2). Later on, various sects and theological schools of thought, making use of philological and pseudo- philological means, tried to vindicate their own opinions or to eliminate objectionable views by a peculiar interpretation of the Holy Scriptures of Islam. This procedure has already been thoroughly characterised by Goldziher (3) and by Kofler (4). Now, since Arab lexicographers commonly felt bound to accept the traditional interpretations of words in the Qur'an and the Hadith, and especially did not reject any of the defini- tions of words which had been prompted by theological induce- ments, indigenous Arabic lexicons not only contain a consi- derable number of explanations which have no raison d'elre except in the sphere of traditional exegesis, but also carry with them the sediment of dogmatic considerations and sectarian arguments (5). (1) E. g., rabb should be used only as a synonym for God, 'abd only in the sense of a worshipper of God ; for (lord D, if applied to a human, and for (( slave, servant one should use saiyid or mauld and ghuldm or fata, respectively. (2) This was readily admitted even by Muslim scholars; see, e. g., IHjjI Khalifa (ed. Fliigel) II, 336 (art. 'ilm al-tafsir). (3) Vorlesungen2, 125 f.; Richtungen, 129 f., 173 ff. (4) In Islamica V, 388 ff. (5) According to the Tdj al-'aris VII, 257, the verb ja'ala has also the meaning of baiyana, as, for example, in the Qur'anic phrase: Innd ja'alndhu qur'dnan</page><page sequence="22">Keeping this fact in mind is rather important for a thorough understanding of the character of the Arabic dictionaries, as the respective data, especially in the smaller works, are in many cases not clearly mentioned. A striking case in point is the word kursl (throne) for which the dictionaries indicate, among others, the sense of 'ilm (know- ledge). In the Qdmus, for example, this curious meaning simply appears side by side with the common one, ((chair )), without any reference to its source or origin. The Tdj al-'arus, however, informs us that it goes back to the Qur'anic passage (Sura 22, 55): wasi'a kursiyuhu 'l-samdwdti wal-arda ((His throne extendeth over the heavens and the earth ). The anthropomorphism expressed here was found objectionable by certain circles who endeavoured, with the help of a doubtful locus probans, to interpret this passage so as harmonise it with a purified religious conception, replacing God's throne by His knowledge. Arabic dictionaries also contain explanations which, though not essentially differing from the foregoing, nevertheless appear in another attire. The method, so commonly applied in early Islam, of securing authority for religious opinions by expressing them in the form of Hadiths, was used in lexicography, too. A considerable number of difficult expressions, especially such as occur in Qur'an and Hadith, were interpreted by adducing traditions, probably forged, in which the Prophet himself gives the meanings of the words in question. These explanations, the correctness of which is certainly not above all doubt, also found their way into the dictionaries. VIII We now come to an instance from the domain of morphology. Against the prevalent opinion that dhdd is the plural of ahad, Abu 'l-'Abbas (Tha'lab or al-Mubarrad ?), quoted in the Taj al-'aris, strongly insisted that this could not be the case. The 'arab[yan (SCra 43). This interpretation aims at eliminating any basis for the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was created. 54 L. KOPF</page><page sequence="23">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY reason is that ahad is used in the Qur'an (Sura 11, 21) as a syno- nymof the divine name and, therefore, cannot have a plural form. Abi 'l-'Abbas suggested to assign to ahad the singular wdhid (1) after the model shdhid-ashhdd, which, however, is not in keeping with strict morphological rules; the analogy would require a plural auhad. IX Religious influences also played a decisive part in the discus- sions about the origin and the development of the Arabic language and of human speech in general (2). The treatment of this problem, it is true, has by now been excluded from the realm of linguistics proper, since the conclusion has been reached that it cannot be solved by purely linguistic means; also in Arabic literature it was mostly treated not by philologists but by theologians and especially in the works on the usil al-fiqh, but since it came to be dealt with in philological writings too (3), it should not be passed over here; the less so as the solution which was prompted by religious considerations and which eventually gained supremacy had some bearing on the history of written Arabic in the middle ages. Apart from the minority view that human speech originated in the spontaneous imitation of sounds which occur in nature, most Muslim scholars ascribed the rise of language to volitional action, and, therefore, in the discussions of the problem the term wddi' and its derivatives figure prominently. The main controversy pivoted around the question whether language was of divine or human origin, i. e. whether it had been imparted (1) This word too, occurs in connection with the divine name in many places of the Qur'an, but it was probably considered as a mere epithet, not as a synonymous noun, of Allah and, therefore, a plural form could be assigned to it without scruples. (2) A comprehensive survey of the different shades of opinion is given in the Muzhir I, 8-30. Goldziher has discussed the problem in a paper written in Hunga- rian (see B. Heller, Bibliographie, 28) which I have been unable to use. (3) The extensive quotations in the Muzhir I, 8-30, are taken from the Khasa'is of Ibn Jinnl (Cairo 1913, 39-46) and from Ibn Faris, al-Sdhibt (5-7). Ibn Jinn's discussion, with some deviations, is anonymously cited by Ibn SIda in his Mukhas- sas 3-6. 55</page><page sequence="24">to man by God (here, the terms tauqif, wahy or ilhdm are used) or whether men themselves had invented it and come to an agreement with one another about its use (the respective terms are islilah, tawddu' or tawdlu'). This last solution of the problem is said to have been favoured by the Mu'tazilites, while orthodox circles seemingly preferred the view that language owed its existence to divine revelation. This opinion was not merely a pious surmise; it derived strong support from certain Qur'anic passages and from their authoritative interpretation. Tradition has it that the problem had already occupied the minds of the earliest authorities of Islam. The Qur'anic verse (Sira 2, 31) : ((And He taught Adam all the names ), which was the main proof of the adherents of the revelation theory, had been interpreted by some ancient exegetes as meaning that by &lt; names )) all generic nouns were meant. Others, though, had suggested different explanations -the names of the angels or of Adam's offspring -, because the pronoun hum which occurs in the following sentence can refer only to beings possessed of intellect, but this difficulty was easily overcome by the contention that ( names )) implies both inanimate things and human beings and that, therefore, the pronoun had been employed a potiori by way of taghllb. Against the objection that only the nouns are mentioned in the Qur'an, whereas human speech comprises also verbs and particles, it could be argued that nouns are the most important class of words without which, in contrast to the others, no sentence can be constructed, and for this reason they alone had found special mention. Another explanation to the same effect was that ism (( name )) properly means ((sign )) (from the root w sm) so that asmd' ( names )) also implies the other parts of speech, the terminological distinction between them being an arbitrary act on the part of the grammarians. Yet another Qur'anic verse could be adduced in favour of the revelation theory (Sura 30, 22) : ((Amongst His signs are the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your tongues and colours ?. If human speech were not of divine origin, the variety of languages could not be considered a demonstration of God's almightiness. 56 L. KOPF</page><page sequence="25">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY Some authorities maintained that only a part of the language stemmed from God, while another part had been developed by men themselves. These thad a third Qur'anic verse at hand (Sira 53, 23) : (They are nothing but names which you and your fathers have given ), from which it can be inferred that the other words of the language are of divine origin. In addition to these Qur'anic passages, some hadiths could be quoted in support of the view that language originated from God (1). This theory, which tradition attributes already to the majority of the earliest commentators of the Qur'an, seems to have gained, at last, unchallenged supremacy. Al-SuyiitI opens his Muzhir with the words : ((Praise to be God, the creator of the tongues and languages, who assigned the words to the notions in accordance with the exigencies of His sublime wisdom... ) The divine origin of speech had even been admitted as a probable possibility by the Mu'tazilite philologists Ibn Jinnl and his teacher Abui 'All al-Farisi, in contrast with the opinion which was held by the majority of their fellow-sectarians. The way in which speech, according to this theory, became a property of man is described as follows: it was imparted by God to the earliest prophets, such as Adam, and enriched in the revelations to later ones (2). Muhammad was privileged to surpass, also in this respect, all his predecessors, and, since he was the last of the prophets, to put the seal on any further development of language. This is how Ibn Faris depicts the matter (3) : One might, perhaps, assume that the language which we have proved to be of divine origin came into existence at one time. This is not so, but God imparted to Adam what He willed to teach him and what he needed to know in his time... Then, after Adam, He taught the Arab prophets, each one what He willed to teach him, until the matter reached (1) Muzhir I, 33, 35, 346. (2) Here, for once, the adherents of the islilah theory found an opportunity of defending their view by means of the Qur'an. The verse (Sura 14,4): ,We never sent any messenger but with the speech of his people v, constituted a strong proof that language had existed before the mission of any prophet. (3) Sal-ahibt, 6.</page><page sequence="26">L. KOPF our prophet Muhammad; God bestowed upon him of this (i. e. the language) what He had not bestowed upon any one before him... Then, the affair rested where it was, and we do not know of any expression (lugha) which newly came into existence after him ). This last idea is also expressed in the Fihrist (p. 5): ((The Arabs refrained from adding [new expres- sions] to the language after the Prophet's mission because of the Qur'an ). From the assumption that language was of divine origin and that, as far as Arabic is concerned, its development was terminated once and for all with the mission of Muhammad, the conclusion was drawn that no change whatsoever may occur in it further on. Since language derives from God, it is not permissible to alter the meanings of words, such as to apply ((cloth )) to ((horse)) or vice versa. ((Everything which was named by Adam will be so denoted until the Day of Resurrec- tion ). Also morphological and syntactic innovations are inadmissible, since these features of the language have been established by its inaugurator once and for all (1). Ibn Faris, who was one of the stoutest protagonists of the revelation theory, sums up this attitude after claiming that even etymological matters are dependent upon divine revelation (2) : ((We are not entitled to-day to innovate, to use expressions which they (i. e. the ancient Arabs) did not use, or to develop analogies which they did not know; for this would mean corrupting the language and annihilating its essence ). This view yielded a religious motive for the tendency to confine the sphere of genuine Arabic to the usage prevalent up to the end of the Umaiyad era and to consider all later linguistic developments as mere corruptions. Although this tendency was probably initiated by other considerations, the religiously coloured motivation undoubtedly had its share in strengthening it and in perpetuating the ever widening gap between written and spoken Arabic. This assumption is borne out by a state- (1) AbO IHaiyan, quoted in Muzhir I, 42 f. (2) Al-Sdhibi, 33.</page><page sequence="27">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON ARABIC PHILOLOGY 59 ment of the same Ibn Faris. He argued that unless the divine origin of language were presumed, there would be no justifi- cation for restricting linguistic research to the usage of the ancient Arabs; if language were of human make, the same authority should be attributed to later usage as well (').
