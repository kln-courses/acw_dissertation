<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PRIMITIVE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE. By J. H. HUTTON, C.I.E., D.Sc. Frazer Lecture, 1938. Humphrey Milford. Oxford University Press. 2s. IN devoting his Frazer Lecture to a study of a primitive philo- sophy of life Professor Hutton returns to a theme he has made his own since he first became aware of the conception of soul- substance among the Naga of Assam, confirmed later by the Karen doctrine, and many parallels in the Indonesian area. As the present reviewer has endeavoured to show, it is this belief in life as a finite substance permeating the body and capable of transference from one person to another, or to vegetable and animal species, that is fundamental in the institution of sacrifice,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 327 and as Professor Hutton contends, from it arises " what amounts to a regular philosophy of the soul conceived of in some zoo- morphic or anthropomorphic shape". Its diffusion in various parts of the body gives rise to the idea of a multiplicity of souls in a single organism, and once soul-substance is regarded as taking animal or human shape the way is opened for meta- psychosis and " every form of animism and thence to poly- theism or monotheism ". Against the fatal error of deriving from a single concept a mass of complex customs and beliefs having certain common features, he guards himself by readily admitting that animism in its manifold aspects may have had very diverse origins. All he would argue is that this notion of life as a finite substance is a fertile source of the conceptions of primitive philosophy and ul- timately of the more developed philosophies of civilized peoples. From this same fundamental belief, it is held, nagualism and lycanthropy probably developed, while totemism, so often associated with the external soul, may be traceable to the same idea. The couvade springs from the notion that the father and his offspring share a common soul-substance, and exogamy has been enjoined in order to amass life and fertility from outside the community. The king, on the other hand, is compelled to contract an incestuous union either to keep the tribal life pure at its source, or, as Frazer suggests, where matrilineal descent once prevailed, to continue the hereditary right to rule. Simi- larly mana and magic are alleged to be derivatives of the conception of soul-substance when attempts to explain the vital essence animating a living organism began to assume an im- personal character as a force or power capable of transference from one person or object to another. Actually, however, magic and mana are quite distinct and independent reactions though both have points of contact with the idea of soul-substance. Professor Hutton has raised a number of very interesting problems which in the course of a single lecture could only be stated in terms of his hypothesis. It is to be hoped that he will work out at greater length the suggested line of development here set forth as a primitive philosophy of life. E. O. JAMES</page></plain_text>
