An attempt is made to list some assumptions on page 8; however, con- cepts of closed versus open populations and equal catchability versus various types of unequal catchabi- lity are confused. Such confusion is evident on page 77 where we find, "Whatever the method, however, there is one underlying assumption which is particularly per- tinent: that all individuals have an equal chance of being caught." This is not true in general, nor is it true for the methods of Jolly ( 1965) or Manly and Parr ( 1968). The book is nonmathematical, very readable and nicely printed. I believe it would be useful as an in- troduction for undergraduates. The advanced student or researcher would not gain much from the material. It is quite tutorial and will probably not aid the field biolo- gist in his research nor will it provide references to the more modern and adequate methods. D. R.

Princeton University Press, Prince- ton, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1978, 237 pp. $16.00 cloth, $6.95 paper. This is the 13th monograph in the Princeton series in Population Biology. This series has established itself as a means of providing a highly individualistic and novel approach to a subject. References in the ecological liter- ature show that the first monograph (MacArthur and Wilson's The Theory of Island Biogeography) and some of the later ones (such as May's Stability and Com- plexity in Model Ecosystems) have had a transforming eSect upon the development of ecological thought. With such predecessors, writing another monograph in this series must be a daunting task. Dr. Hassell demonstrates clearly his long-standing in- terest in the field of predator-prey and parasitoid-host dynamics. The book starts with a brief historical review, describing some simple models in the literature, and fo- cussing attention on the three empirical models known as types I, II and III functional responses (relating the number of prey attacked to the prey density). However, these simple models assume that predators search ran- domly, whereas the stability of model systems is depen- BEGON, M. Illvestigating Animal Abundance: Cat ture-Recapture for Biologists. Edward Arnold Ltd., London, 97pp. Â£3.95. The author of this book states his objective as ". . . to communicate to biologists, at both student and research level, the essential simplicity of the mathematical tech- niques; and also to reassure them that it is their experi- ence, as biologists, which can turn a sterile mathemati- cal technique into a potent biological weapon." Much of the first half of the book focuses on the older, deterministic methods including Petersen's (1896), Schnabel's (1938), Jackson's (1937) positive and negative methods, Bailey's (1951) triple catch method, Fisher and Ford's ( 1947) and an ad hoc method to parti- tion losses and gains. The only modern methods (i.e., fully developed, stochastic models where efficient es- timators of the parameters and their variance-covari- ance matrix are available) covered are those by Jolly (1965) and Manly and Parr (1968). All these methods are reviewed briefly and illustrated by a simple ex- ample. The second half of the book begins with a section on interpretation (Chapter 3) to discuss standard errors, confidence limits, reliability, accuracy, precision, etc. This section is very elementary. I found an error in in- terpretation concerning accuracy. On page 46 we find the incorrect statement, "The smaller the standard error (the tighter the confidence limits), the more accurate is the estimate." Estimates and particularly their sampling variances are quite dependent upon the assumptions made. No- where is this more true than in capture-recapture mod- els Therefore, selection of the best model (assumption set) is of importance. Tests of model assumptions and model selection (Chapter 4) is perhaps the strongest sec- tion of the book, but by no means complete. About eight tests are given and illustrated with numerical ex- amples. The final chapter discusses some practicalities, but only in a rudimentary way. Problems of sample size, trap placement, accidental deaths on capture, edge ef- fect, lack of closure, number of traps, recording data, numbering of traps and number of trapping occasions are only briefly mentioned in passing, if at all. My main criticism is that too much is made of the older, deterministic methods while failing to mention or even reference a host of better methods. The models of Robson (1969), Pollock (1975) and Arnason (1973) for open populations should have been discussed in some detail. No mention was made of the various frequency 901 BOOK REVIEWS R. M.

Mainland's Elementary Medical Sta- dent upon the pattern (aggregation) of both the prey and predator, and is increased by the presence of prey refuges. Stability of these model systems is also in- creased when there is mutual interference between searching predators, and when a predator is able to ex- hibit switching (taking a larger proportion of a common prey and a smaller proportion of a rare prey) between two or more potential prey species. These concepts, de- veloped by the author with their underlying mathemati- cal models, and bearing in mind some of the essential differences between predators and parasitoids, are ap- plied to the field of biological control. A few general- isations can be made, e.g. a host-specific parasitoid is likely to be a more efficient control organism than a polyphagous one, or the presence of hyperparasitoids will raise the pest's stable equilibrium density. Such conclusions are relatively mundane, and it is clear that there is still much to understand about the population dynamics of biological control. In the introduction to this review two criteria of the Princeton Series were mentioned: individualism and novelty. This book is certainly individualistic since so much of the work described has been published by the author (the reference section lists 26 papers of which Dr. Hassell is either author or co-author). Despite this individualistic approach, the subject matter of the book is well-balanced, except that population age structure, mentioned in the introductory chapter and the epilogue, is almost forgotten. Hence, this book will undoubtedly form an extremely useful textbook of population dy- namics. The second criterion, novelty, is not attained. The book surveys the subject, being essentially a re- view, and will not be seen to infuse new ideas into the science of ecology in the way that some of the other monographs in the series have done.

There is little in it which is likely to be of great interest to bio- metricians. Indeed, the only contribution with any di- rect bearing on biometry is a short paper using ther- modynamic and chemical analogies to connect speciation and population size in the Volterra model. There are also two articles which explore the uses of in- formation theory in theoretical biology. Apart from these and papers on inductive logic and on search the- ory, most of the contributions are concerned in some way with applications to statistical mechanics. There are two informative survey papers, also with a ther- modynamic flavour, which include some intriguing ap- plications among their references. P. E.

One cannot think of a better choice for the Se- ries' first reprint in biostatistics than Mainland's Ele- mentary Medical Statistics, as this book ranks with Bradford Hill's Principles of Medical Statistics in its in- fluence and impact on clinical research. In Socratic style, it reviews a research project from beginning to end using ten groups of questions. Current investigators brought up on statistical pack- ages and hand-held calculators would benefit by its commonsense approach. Today, we perhaps too readily apply high-powered computer-based procedures instead of thinking our way through the statistical analysis. Your students may find the style wordy. Medical stu- dents who had criticized my teaching as too mathemati- cal were asked to read Mainland and found the text ver- bose! For this reason and because it is out of date, this reprint is best used to supplement more recent develop- ments in statistical analysis. Many of these develop- ments, such as survival analysis,.di.screte multivariate analysis, sequential trials, etc. lie outside the book's scope. If Dr. Mainland could be persuaded to write a third edition he would surely include sections on the mangement of multi-center trials and natural history studies, in addition to rewriting his treatment of exact 2 x 2 tests and confidence limits, omitting the tables in favor of computational algorithms. It is doubtful, however, if anyone, let alone Dr. Main- land, could do this without in effect rewriting the whole book. This reprint is therefore welcome in that everyone should have a copy of Mainland on his shelf to remind him of the fundamentals. S. J.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1979, 352 pp. $20.00 cloth, $7.50 paper. The social insects have fascinated generations of biol- ogists and natural historians, partly because they appear somewhat anthropomorphic (terms like 'queen', 'sol- dier', 'worker', etc. are evidence of this) and partly be- cause the uniting of many individuals into an organic whole (developed to its greatest extent in the almost fic- tional writings of Eugene Morais) has attracted human imagination. With this wealth of uncritical interest in social insects it is extremely pleasant to read a book that critically analyses the evolution and role of eusociality. The book explores the origins of social structures and emphasises the eusociality threshold concept, first pub- lished in 1976 by E. O. Wilson. The eusocial insects ex- hibit three traits: cooperation in caring for the young, a division into reproducing and non-reproducing forms, and an overlap of at least two generations (usually ac- companied by a haploid/diploid reproductive process).</page></plain_text>
