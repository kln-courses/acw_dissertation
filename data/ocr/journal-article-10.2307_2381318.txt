<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM ON RATIONALITY AND MORALITY Moral Judgment and the Acceptance of Norms* Allan Gibbard In recent years, various ethical theorists have turned to considering the nature of rationality.' How, after all, might we best seek out a promising line of approach to fundamental moral questions? A possible stratagem is to ask first why moral questions matter. The chief reasons must surely lie in what their answers can tell us of how to live-and in this response may lie hints of a way to proceed. Look for what, in a general prescription for living, plays the role of morality and take that itself to constitute morality. Deciding how to live, after all, is in effect deciding how it is rational to live. Begin, then, by developing a theory of rational conduct, and then in that theory, see if there is anything that fits our ordinary, vague picture of the demands of morality. If there is, call that morality- for whether or not it is what we initially conceived morality to be, it is what we can rationally treat in much the way we initially treated morality in our thinking. This broad approach evidently requires a theory of rational conduct. What does it mean for something to be "rational"? To call a thing "rational" is to endorse it in some sense, and that in turn suggests a scheme for eliciting the meaning of 'rational.' Instead of seeking to define a property, "rationality," by giving the conditions under which a thing would have that property or lack it, start with the use of the term. Fix on the dictum The articles in this issue of Ethics are the proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual Oberlin Colloquium in Philosophy, held April 13-15, 1984. The topic of the colloquium was "Rationality and Morality." Following the colloquium, each main speaker was invited to revise his paper for publication; and commentators prepared the published versions of their comments from this final version. Main speakers were also invited to prepare rejoinders to their commentators. The 1984 Oberlin Colloquium was the first to be partially funded by the Gertrude Dahl Philosophy Colloquium Fund. * Much of this article is drawn from work done while I was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, with support from a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for Independent Study and Research and from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. 1. I have in mind, among other people, Richard Brandt and aspects of recent work by R. M. Hare and John Rawls. See R. B. Brandt, A Theory of the Good and the Right (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979); R. M. Hare, Moral Thinking: Its Levels, Method, and Point (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981), esp. pt. 3; and John Rawls, "Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory," Journal of Philosophy 77 (1980): 515-72. Ethics 96 (October 1985): 5-21 ? 1985 by Allan Gibbard. 5</page><page sequence="2">6 Ethics October 1985 "To call a thing rational is to endorse it" and search for a sense of the term 'endorse' for which the dictum holds true. The word 'rational' has a learned flavor, but the concept I am tracking is familiar enough. It is the one we use when we talk about "what it makes sense" to do or to believe, or when we speak of actions as "reasonable" or "unreasonable," or when we search for the "best thing to do" in a way that does not presuppose that we are searching for the morally best thing to do. There does seem to be a common notion involved in all these turns of phrase; one test is that to affirm one of an action while denying another would be to invite puzzlement, not to invoke a distinction we could expect the audience to grasp antecedently. When we use the more learned term 'rational,' it is often this notion we are trying to apply. I try in this article to give some inkling of a larger project. What I say will thus be sketchy and incomplete, but I hope it will suggest directions for thought. I begin by laying out some characteristics of rationality as it appears in ordinary thought, suitably refined. These are characteristics we might want an analysis of the term 'rational' to capture. I then turn to the relation of morality to rationality and develop a proposal that stems from Mill. Questions of morality, on this proposal, are questions concerning the rationality of certain specifically moral emotions: guilt and resentment. Only after this do I return to the concept of rationality and broach the analysis I want to combine with Mill's proposal. Cryptically put, the analysis is that to call something rational is to express one's acceptance of norms that permit it. That leaves much to be explained: among other things, what it is for a person to accept a norm. In the last part of the article I speculate on the psychological nature of the acceptance of norms. I sketch how the psychic mechanisms -involved might be explained naturalistically; they can be understood, I suggest, as devices for inter- personal coordination. Normative discussion coordinates emotions and actions, and in the life of a social animal such coordination can be vital. The analysis I broach is noncognitivistic, in the narrow sense that on the analysis, to call a thing "rational" is not straightforwardly to attribute a property to it, but to do something else. I have argued elsewhere that leading cognitivistic accounts of what 'rational' means fail; the same kinds of arguments as G. E. Moore used to discredit "naturalistic" definitions of moral terms apply to 'rational' as well.2 I shall not repeat these arguments here, but I should say at the outset that what I say here presupposes that attempts to treat rationality as a straightforward property fail. They miss a crucial element of endorsement that the term connotes. My analysis is not meant to capture a substantive view on the nature of rationality; rather it is meant to capture the common element in dispute when people disagree on the nature of rationality. It is supposed to tell us what it is to debate what is rational and to wonder what is 2. See my "A Non-Cognitivistic Analysis of Rationality in Action," Social Theory and Practice 9 (1984): 199-221, esp. 200-206.</page><page sequence="3">Gibbard Moral Judgment 7 rational. If I am right, deciding what sorts of things are rational is in effect deciding what norms to accept for a given domain of appraisal. I. WHAT IS APPRAISED AS RATIONAL OR IRRATIONAL In everyday life we appraise a wide variety of human attributes as "rational" or "irrational." Not only can a person act rationally or irrationally, but he can also believe rationally or irrationally, and he can be angry or grateful or envious rationally or irrationally. It is irrational, for example, to be angry at the messenger who brings bad tidings but rational to be angry at the miscreant who deliberately wrongs one. Or at least this, I take it, is what we tend to think in the normal course of life. If the word "rational" seems overly learned here, I suggest close substitutes with a more homely flavor: "It doesn't make sense" to be angry at the person who brings bad news he had no part in making. You "shouldn't be grateful" to someone who benefited you only inadvertently in seeking his own gain. It is this family of appraisals I seek to interpret. Do they make genuine sense, and if so, how are they to be understood? If the term 'rational' can be applied intelligibly to as wide a range of human attributes as we seem to think, does it have the same meaning in all these contexts? It might be thought that for something to be rational is for it to be desirable or advantageous. Such a crude pragmatism, though, would leave ordinary thought about rationality mysterious: it fits actions, perhaps, but not beliefs and attitudes. Take the stock example of the man who has some evidence his wife is unfaithful. Whether it is still rational for him to believe her faithful depends on his evidence, and on his evidence alone. Whether it is desirable for him to believe her faithful, and whether his believing her faithful is goodfor him, depend as well on how his beliefs would affect his feelings toward her. The rationality of a belief and its desirability, then, are different, if ordinary thought is to be trusted. Likewise, it might be disadvantageous for one of Cleopatra's courtiers to be angry at her, even if she ordered an execution unjustly, and it thus "made sense" to be angry at her. For the courtier might want to ingratiate himself with her, and he might rightly fear that anger would cloud his countenance and spoil his charm. In that case, he would have every reason to want not to be angry, and still, we seem to think, it would make sense for him to be angry. It made no like sense for Cleopatra to be angry at the slave who brought news of Antony's defeat-however therapeutic or palliative her anger might have been. For anger to make sense is not for it to be advantageous. In all this we must distinguish saying that it makes sense for a person to be angry from saying that it makes sense that the person is angry. If I have had a bad day and now face a new disappointment, it "makes sense that I am angry"-we can expect me to be angry in the circumstances, for reasons we understand-even if it doesn't "make sense for me to be angry" because the new disappointment is no one's fault. Likewise, it</page><page sequence="4">8 Ethics October 1985 makes sense that Cleopatra was angry at the messenger, but it made no sensefor her to be angry at him. Misdirected anger in the circumstances was to be expected, but the bad news was not the messenger's fault. Are these ordinary distinctions truly intelligible? Can we really dis- tinguish anger's making sense from anger's being desirable? If we under- stood the word 'rational,' we could put the distinction as follows. In the case of the courtier and the queen, even though it is rational for him to be angry with her for ordering an execution unjustly, it may also be rational for him to want to ingratiate himself with her, for his own good or for that of her subjects. If anger would prevent that, then it may be rational for him to want not to be angry with her. Thus in such a case, it is rational to be angry but also rational to want not to be angry. This pattern applies not only to emotion but also to belief. Take the stock case of a deceived husband: his evidence may make it rational for him to believe his wife unfaithful, but the way the belief would affect his feelings toward her may make it rational for him to want to believe her faithful. Rationally feeling or believing something is distinct from rationally wanting to feel or believe it. Talk of emotions as "rational" or "irrational" will strike many readers as dubious. True, we may say the kinds of things I have been claiming we say: that it "makes sense to be angry" in certain cases and "it makes no sense to be angry" in others. It may still be asked, though, whether these judgments can bear scrutiny. It may well seem that we can appraise as rational or irrational only what is under a person's voluntary control. Emotions fail this test, since they are not under a person's direct voluntary control. True, they can be nurtured or repressed, but a person cannot simply be angry at will, or grateful at will. Nor can a person refrain from any of these things simply at will. What can be appraised as rational or irrational is not an emotion itself, it may be said, but taking measures to nurture or repress it. Now I accept, of course, that emotions cannot be had or cast off at will. What I deny is the dictum "Only the voluntary can be appraised as rational or irrational." Beliefs seem prime examples of what we can appraise as rational or irrational, but beliefs, like emotions, cannot be had or cast off at will. We may be able to "make believe" at will, but that is not the same as really believing at will. None of this is to say that when we call an act, belief, or emotion "rational" we are saying something intelligible; that remains to be seen. I am saying that we talk and think as if such appraisals are intelligible. It may be worthwhile, then, to see if we can interpret them as intelligible. II. RATIONALITY AND MORALITY Before I proceed to hunt for an account of what 'rational' means, I turn to morality and its relation to rationality. In what follows, I shall naively suppose that we know what 'rational' means; only later will I be broaching an analysis of the term.</page><page sequence="5">Gibbard Moral Judgment 9 In the history of moral philosophy, there seem to be at least two sharply different conceptions of what morality is. On what I shall call the "broad" conception, morality is simply practical rationality in the fullest sense: to say that an act is morally right is to say that it is rational. Kant and Sidgwick are prime exponents of this broad conception, which is shared by many current writers. On this conception, it makes no sense to ask, "Is it always rational to do what is morally right?" for 'the morally right' simply means "the rational." On a "narrow" conception of morality, in contrast, moral considerations are just some of the considerations that bear on what it makes sense to do. Nonmoral considerations matter too. On the narrow conception, for instance, it is normally wrong to injure others, to steal, or to break one's word. It would normally not be morally wrong, though, to fritter away a day for which one had planned an enjoyable hike-however irrational that might be. On the broad conception of morality, morally right action simply is action that is truly rational, whereas on the narrow conception, an act may be truly irrational without being morally wrong. In chapter 5 of Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill uses the term 'morality' in this narrow sense and offers an account of what is distinctive about "morality" so taken. "Morality," he says, "pertains to what is wrong or not wrong, and to say that an act is wrong is to say that there ought to be a sanction against it, a sanction of law, of public opinion, or of conscience." The 'ought' here, Mill proposes, should be judged by the standards of the greatest happiness principle-but that is part of Mill's normative theory, not his theory of meanings. What I propose to do is to take over Mill's analysis of what "morality" is in the narrow sense, with various interpretations and modifications.' When Mill says there "ought" to be a sanction, let us read him as saying that a sanction is rational-or, perhaps, rationally required. Let us also drop talk of legal sanctions. Suppose, say, we think that people who overpark at parking meters ought to be fined, but that they ought not to feel guilty and ought not to be resented by others for overparking. In that case, it seems to me, we do not think overparking morally wrong; we merely think that a price should be charged. That leaves sanctions of conscience and of public opinion: sanctions of guilt and remorse, on the one hand, and of blame, resentment, and moral outrage, on the other. Thus as the proposal now stands, what a person does is morally wrong if and only if it is rational for him to feel guilty for doing it, and for others to resent him for doing it. As it stands, the analysis is more plausible for 'blameworthy' than for 'morally wrong.' The term 'wrong,' it is often said, has two distinct moral senses, the objective and the subjective. The difference between the two is displayed through stories like this: Yesterday, I had the brakes 3. It was David Lyons who brought Mill's theory to current philosophical attention in a series of articles. See esp. his "Mill's Theory of Morality," Nous 10 (1976): 101-20.</page><page sequence="6">10 Ethics October 1985 of my car checked. Today, I drive a friend to the supermarket, but on the way, my brakes fail and I kill a pedestrian. Driving my car, then, has turned out to be wrong in the "objective" sense, but not in the "subjective" sense-since I had every reason to think my brakes reliable, and my friend needed to get to the store. Thus an act is wrong in the objective sense if it is wrong in light of all the facts, knowable and unknowable, whereas it is wrong in the subjective sense if it is wrong in light of what the agent had good reason to believe. More precisely, an act is wrong in the subjective sense if it is wrong in light of the degrees of plausibility (or "subjective probabilities") the agent has reason to ascribe to relevant propositions. Now the analysis I have proposed will clearly not work for 'wrong' in the objective sense. In the story, my driving my car turns out to be wrong in the objective sense, but it would not make sense for me to feel guilty over it, or for others to resent me for it. What about the subjective sense? It is this sense that really matters, for a theory for the subjective sense can offer moral guidance: even when we know we are ignorant of the relevant facts, we can use the theory, together with what we think we do know, to decide what acts to avoid on moral grounds.4 Might the analysis I have proposed work, then, for 'wrong' in the subjective sense? Might an act be wrong in the subjective sense if and only if it is rational for the agent to feel guilty over the act and for others to resent him for it? I think not. Wrongness, even in the subjective sense, is not the same as blameworthiness, and when the two diverge, the proposal seems most apt as an analysis of 'blameworthiness.'5 Imagine that, in a paroxysm of grief, I speak rudely to a friend who offers condolences and so hurt his feelings. My rudeness is unprovoked but understandable in the circum- stances. I have thus acted wrongly, but because of my agitated state, it may not make sense to blame me. If it does not, then my act is wrong in the subjective sense, but not blameworthy. An act is blameworthy, we might say, if and only if it makes sense for the agent to feel guilty over it, and for others to resent him for it-but we still need to ask what it means to call an act "morally wrong." Why, then, should we need a distinct concept of "wrong" in the subjective sense, as opposed to "blameworthy"? The answer seems to be that the concepts of "right" and "wrong" are forward looking in a way that the concept of blameworthiness is not. The morally conscientious agent is one who asks himself which of the acts open to him are right and which are wrong and then rules out any act he judges wrong. That 4. This is argued in my "Act-Utilitarian Agreements," in Values and Morals, ed. Alvin I. Goldman and Jaegwon Kim (Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1978), pp. 95-96. 5. R. B. Brandt, in Ethical Theory (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1959), argues that 'reprehensible' cannot be defined in terms of 'moral obligation' (p. 458) and then offers a definition of 'reprehensible' that is quite close, in some respects, to the one I am offering.</page><page sequence="7">Gibbard Moral Judgment 11 means, among other things, that the rightness or wrongness of an al- ternative does not depend on the agent's motives. Rather, conscientious motivation consists in trying to confine one's actions to what is right. Blame, in contrast, attaches to the agent in retrospect; the agent is blamed for acting with insufficient morally desirable motivation. Rightness is prospective; blame is retrospective. What, then, might it mean to call an act wrong? Roughly, we might say, the standards of right and wrong are the standards we demand an agent use to rule out certain alternatives. In assessing blame, we apply two kinds of tests. First, we ask whether the agent's level of morally desirable motivation was satisfactory. If not, we ask whether there are extenuating circumstances that render the agent not fully responsible. Standards of right and wrong pertain to the first part: an agent's motives are morally acceptable if he is sufficiently motivated to avoid wrong acts. Standards for wrongness, then, are the standards such that an agent is prima facie blameworthy if he does not use them to rule out acts that violate them. The reason the blameworthiness is only prima facie is that facts about the person's motivational state may be extenuating. Blame thus depends both on standards of wrongness in the subjective sense and on standards for responsibility. Formally put, then, the definitions I propose are these: an act is wrong if and only if it violates standards for ruling out actions, such that if an agent in a normal frame of mind violated those standards because he was not substantially motivated to conform to them, he would be to blame. To say that he would be to blame, here, is to say that it would be rational for him to feel guilty and for others to resent him. What I have done in my discussion so far is to suppose that we know what 'rational' means and to propose a way of interpreting the relation between rationality, on the one hand, and concepts that are "moral" in the narrow sense. In the next section, I propose in rough terms an analysis of 'rational' and plug it into the analyses I have given these moral concepts. III. AN ANALYSIS OF 'RATIONAL' APPLIED TO MORAL TERMS What does it mean to call something "rational"? One way of tackling such a question is to psychologize it. What, we may ask, is the psychological state of regarding something as rational, of taking it to be rational, of believing it rational? The answer I want to give is noncognitivistic. To call an action, belief, or attitude "rational," if I am on the right track, is not to express a proposition; it is to do something else. What that "something else" is I shall try to explain psychologistically, by saying what it is to think something rational. Put cryptically, the hypothesis I shall develop is this: that to think something rational is to accept norms that permit it. This rough analysis needs much elucidation and refinement, and I will not be able to say</page><page sequence="8">12 Ethics October 1985 here nearly all I think should be said. I do hope to give you some intimation of what I hope can be done along the lines I am suggesting. Take first my use of the word 'norm.' By a "norm" here, I mean a possible rule or prescription, either general or specific. The prescription need not actually be made by anyone, or accepted by anyone, to count as a "norm"~ as I am using the term; I am thus using the term as a short way of saying "possible norm." The main thing to be explained, then, is not what a "norm" is, but what "accepting a norm" is -or more precisely, what it is for something to be permitted or required by "the norms" a person "accepts." I mean these latter notions to be psychological: they are meant to figure in an explanatory theory of human experience and action. Consider next some schematic illustrations. Delilah, let us suppose, is pondering whether various of Samson's acts, beliefs, and emotions are rational. What is it, on the proposal, for her to conclude that one of Samson's acts, beliefs, or emotions indeed is rational? It is for her to accept norms that, as applied to Samson's situation as she thinks it to be, permit that act, belief, or emotion. Thus when Samson destroys the Philistine temple, Delilah considers the act rational if and only if she accepts norms that permit-for Samson's situation as she takes it to be- destroying the temple. She might, for instance, accept the norm, "When in the hands of one's enemies with no hope of escape, kill as many of them as possible, even if you must kill yourself in the process." Then if she believes that Samson is in the hands of his enemies with no hope of escape and that destroying the temple will kill as many of his enemies as possible, then she considers his action rational. Earlier, Samson believed Delilah loyal to him. Delilah, then, thinks this belief to have been rational if and only if she accepts norms for belief that, for Samson's situation at the time as she now conceives it, permit believing one's woman loyal to one. Samson hates the Philistines, and Delilah considers his hatred rational if and only if she accepts norms that, for his situation, permit such hatred. Nothing I have said here, I stress, speaks to whether Samson's actions, beliefs, and emotions really were rational. My hypothesis is not that a person's action, belief, or emotion really is rational if someone-be it I, or the person in question, or a commentator-accepts norms that prescribe it for that person's circumstances. It is not directly a hypothesis about what it is for something to be rational at all. It is a hypothesis about what it is to think or believe something rational, to regard it as rational, to consider it rational. An observer believes an action, belief, or emotion A of mine to be rational, the hypothesis is, if and only if he accepts norms that permit A for my circumstances. It follows that, if we want to decide what really is rational, we shall have to decide what norms to accept ourselves - for that is what it is to form an opinion as to the rationality of something. To believe something rational, I have said, is to accept norms that permit it. In this cryptic form, the proposal says very little, and even what little it says will need to be refined and modified in various ways.</page><page sequence="9">Gibbard Moral Judgment 13 Many of its problems I shall not be able to address here. I will, though, try to say a little about two sets of problems: first, what a norm is and what it is to accept one, and second, what distinguishes norms of rationality from other kinds of norms, such as norms of morality, norms of etiquette, and aesthetic norms. I turn first to moral norms, and the narrowly moral notions, "blame- worthy" and "wrong." In analyzing these notions in the previous section, I took the term 'rational' as understood. If we now combine these analyses with our rough analysis of 'rational,' we can derive an account of the distinction between moral norms and norms of rationality. All norms, we can say, are norms of rationality, but moral norms in particular are norms for guilt and resentment. Consider first what it is for an action to be "blameworthy." The analyses given so far tell us this: (1) An observer thinks an act blameworthy, or morally reprehensible, if and only if he thinks it rational for the agent to feel guilty over the act, and for others to resent the agent for it. (2) To think something 'rational' is to accept norms that prescribe it. Therefore, we may conclude, to think an act morally reprehensible is to accept norms that prescribe, for such a situation, guilt on the part of the agent and resentment on the part of others. Next consider the term 'morally wrong' (in the subjective sense). The standards for whether an act is wrong, we have said, are the standards such that guilt and resentment are prima facie rational if the agent is not disposed to rule out alternatives that violate them. Thus to think an act wrong is to accept norms for guilt and resentment that, prima facie, would sanction guilt and resentment if the act were preformed. 'Prima facie' here means before questions of the psychological peculiarities of the agent are raised-the psychological peculiarities, that is, that bear on whether the agent is to be considered fully responsible. Norms for wrongness are thus explained in terms of norms for guilt and resentment. This proposal as it stands smacks of circularity; the terms 'prima facie blameworthy' and 'responsible' seem to be defined in terms of each other. The psychic makeup of the agent, after all, has some bearing not only on whether the agent is responsible, but on what acts open to him are wrong. Suppose, for instance, that an act is the only one that is eligible, in the sense that all alternatives to it would leave the agent desperately unhappy. That fact may, in our opinion, tend to justify the act morally: it might be that even though the act would otherwise be wrong, this consideration renders it right. A moral adviser, after all, might sincerely advise the agent not to regard the action he was contemplating as wrong, even though it is of a kind that would normally be wrong, and do so precisely because of the psychological effects the alternatives would have on the agent. That, in any case, is what we might well think, and an analysis should allow for the possibility. In what ways, then, are we saying that the "psychological peculiarities" of an agent bear on his degree of moral responsibility, as opposed to the rightness and wrongness of the acts open to him? So far, there is no clear answer. Standards for</page><page sequence="10">14 Ethics October 1985 responsibility, I have said, are standards for when an agent is to blame for acting on prima facie blameworthy motivations. Prima facie blame- worthy motivations are motives for which an agent is to blame if he is fully responsible. Hence although 'blameworthy' itself has been defined independently, the terms 'prima facie blameworthy' and 'responsible' have been defined only in terms of each other. This circularity, I think, can be eliminated as follows: consider an agent who has various psychological peculiarities, and an act for which I would consider the agent to blame if I thought him normal. Our problem, recall, is to untangle whether, because of his psychological peculiarities, I regard the act as right, or whether, rather, I consider the act to be wrong but excusable. The test I propose is this. Imagine the agent for the moment rendered normal but expecting to reacquire his "psychological peculiarities" once he had decided how to act on this occasion. He thus must take these psychological peculiarities into account in deciding what to do, though he is not presently subject to them apart from his belief that he has them. Whether I consider the act to be wrong, then, is a matter of whether I accept norms that would sanction guilt and resentment if the agent, while temporarily rendered normal, were to perform that act. A moral norm forbidding an action, I have proposed, is a norm of rationality governing guilt and resentment. We might likewise speculate that all norms are primarily norms of rationality, and the various different kinds of norms governing, say, a given action-moral norms, aesthetic norms, norms of propriety-are each norms for the rationality of some one kind of attitude one can have toward an action. Just as moral norms are norms for the rationality of guilt and resentment, the aesthetic norms that apply to an action might be norms for the rationality of kinds of aesthetic appreciation of actions, and norms of propriety might be norms for the rationality of shock at an action. Norms of moral praiseworthiness, we can say, are norms for the rationality of an emotion of moral appro- bation. To call an action praiseworthy, on this proposal, is to say that it would make sense to feel moral approbation of the agent for having performed it. To say that, in turn, is to express one's acceptance of norms that permit that feeling, given the facts of the situation as one takes them to be. IV. ACCEPTING A NORM AND BEING IN ITS GRIP To think something rational, I have been proposing, is to accept norms that permit that thing. This is cryptic and incomplete in many ways, and I shall be able to take up just one central respect in which it is incomplete. The analysis as I have stated it gives the meaning of 'rational' in terms of another notion that has so far been left unexplained-in terms of a person's "accepting norms." This places great demands on the notion of accepting a norm.</page><page sequence="11">Gibbard Moral Judgment 15 The most straightforward way to elucidate the "acceptance of norms" would be further analysis: we might look for an analysis of what it means to say things like "Mary accepts the following norms: . . . " I doubt, though, that such an analysis is possible. Instead of trying for an analysis, I shall engage in incipient psychological theorizing. "Accepting a norm," I want to suggest, is a significant kind of psychological state that we are far from entirely understanding. What we can hope to do is not define this state precisely but to point to it. Start by considering a case of "weakness of will." Suppose I "can't get myself to stop" eating nuts at a party. What is happening? One commonsense description is this: I think it "makes sense" to stop eating the nuts-indeed that it doesn't "make sense" to go on eating them- but I nevertheless go on. In this case, it seems, I accept a norm that prescribes eating no more nuts but go on eating them even so. In this commonsense account, it is assumed that the acceptance of a norm is motivating, at least to a degree: believing I ought to stop tends to make me stop. On this occasion, though, the motivation that stems from my accepting a norm is "overpowered" by motivation of another kind: my craving or appetite for nuts. The craving is not itself a matter of my accepting norms; indeed such cravings are sometimes referred to as "animal": we think that they are motivations of a kind we share with beasts. This is a picture of two motivational systems in conflict. One system is of a kind we think peculiar to human beings; it works through a person's accepting norms. We might call this kind of motivation normative motivation, and the putative psychological faculty involved the normative control system. The other putative system we might call the animal control system, since it, we think, is the part of our motivational system that we share with the beasts. Let us treat this picture as a vague psychological hypothesis. "Weakness of will" involves conflict, and so far in my discusion, the conflict has been one between the norms a person accepts and an appetite. Many apparent cases of "weakness of will," though, are not of this kind. Often what we experience is not a conflict between the norms we accept and a bodily appetite but a conflict between our "better judgment" and powerful social motivations. We are paralyzed by embarrassment, or a desire to ingratiate, or some other motivation that is peculiarly social. Examples abound: I may be unable to get myself to walk out of a lecture, even though it is important for me to be somewhere else. I may find myself unable to say something that will be painful to my listener, even though I think it needs to be said. My discussion of "normative control" seems not to have addressed cases like these. An especially powerful demonstration of the kind of conflict I have in mind lies in Milgram's series of experiments on compliance. Subjects of his experiments were told to administer electric shocks-shocks that</page><page sequence="12">16 Ethics October 1985 were increasingly painful and eventually lethal-to another subject (who in fact was not being shocked but was acting as a confederate of the experimenter). Roughly two-thirds of the subjects eventually did all they were ordered to do, although they were upset and protested vigorously.6 Now when we read about these experiments, we are appalled by what the subjects did. Their actions violate norms that we accept. The near uniformity with which the subjects substantially acquiesced, however, should suggest to each of us, "Had I been a subject in one of these experiments before I first read or heard of them, I too would have cooperated with the experimenter-perhaps fully, and almost certainly more than I would like to acknowledge. I would have felt immensely disturbed about the situation in which I found myself, and I would have protested vigorously and regarded the experimenter as a madman. Nevertheless, I probably would have complied." A typical subject in one of these experiments clearly experiences conflict of some sort; that is shown by his protests and his extreme agitation. The conflict, though, is not between a norm he accepts and a bodily appetite. It seems rather to be a conflict between one norm and another. The subject accepts the norm against intentional harm in terms of which we ourselves, as we read about the experiment, condemn his behavior. Nevertheless, he obeys an experimenter who tells him to violate that norm, and he does so, it would appear, because he is strongly motivated to be polite and cooperative-because to refuse, having originally agreed to participate in the experiment, would be uncooperative and insulting to the experimenter. The conflict, we might therefore say, is between opposing norms: a norm of nonharm, on the one hand, and norms of politeness and cooperativeness, on the other. What is the role of norms here? The conflict is between one set of norms and another, true enough, but that suggests a symmetry that is specious. The two sets of norms play different psychological roles. The norm of noninfliction of harm prevails in the judgments of detached observers, whereas the norms of cooperativeness and politeness control the agent in the heat of social encounter. Ordinary language has devices that come close to labeling this contrast. We, as judges, accept a norm against infliction of harm and accept that this norm, in the situation of Milgram's subjects, overrides those norms of politeness and cooperativeness that we also accept. The subjects, on the other hand, do not genuinely accept that, in their situation, norms of politeness and cooperativeness override all other norms. Rather, we might say, they are in the grip of these norms. In common language, then, the contrast is between accepting a norm (or, more precisely, accepting that one set of norms outweighs another in a given situation) with being in the grip of a norm. 6. Stanley Milgram, Obedience to Authority (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974). A fascinating discussion of these experiments and their implications is to be found in John Sabini and Maury Silver, Moralities of Everyday Life (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), esp. chaps. 3-5, 9-11.</page><page sequence="13">Gibbard Moral Judgment 17 Now presumably, whatever happens when I am "in the grip" of a norm that I do not "accept" happens also, much of the time, when I do accept a norm. Take again our ordinary norms of politeness and co- operativeness. In my usual dealings with people, I not only accept these norms as having some weight; I accept them as having enough weight to override any conflicting norms that apply to my situation. I normally give people directions when asked, even if I am in a slight hurry, and this I do not out of weakness of will, but because I accept that it makes sense to help people who need it when the cost is small. In these cases, we would not say that I am "in the grip" of the norms of politeness and cooperativeness that guide my conduct, since I accept them as reasonably controlling in the situation. It may well be, though, that these norms would control my behavior even if I did not accept them or did not accept them as having greatest weight in my situation. In this respect, my psy- chological state is like the state of being in the grip of a norm. We need, then, some term for what is common to situations in which I am "in the grip" of a norm and situations of the more usual kind: situations in which I accept a norm as rightly controlling on balance but would be in its grip if I did not. I propose the colorless, rather technical term internalizing a norm. I have pointed to three sources of motivation that can be teased out of commonsense acounts of weakness of will: appetites, the internalization of norms, and the acceptance of norms. If there are distinctions of this kind to be drawn, how are they tied to ascriptions of rationality? I proposed that rationality has something to do with norms: to call something rational is to express one's acceptance of norms that, on balance, permit it. Once "accepting" a norm has been distinguished from "internalizing" it, we need to ask which of the two belongs in the analysis of 'rational.' Now in the examples, the answer seems clear: it is "accepting" norms that matters here, not "internalizing" them. What, after all, does a subject in one of Milgram's compliance experiments think it rational to do? If his plight is genuinely one of "weakness of will," that is presumably because he thinks that it makes no sense to cooperate but finds himself cooperating nevertheless. In other words, he does what he thinks irrational. Now what he actually does, in this case, is a matter of the norms that have him "in their grip"-norms of politeness and cooperativeness that he has internalized. What he thinks it "rational" to do, on the other hand, is what is required by norms against inflicting pain and danger-and these are the norms he "accepts" as having most weight in his situation. Thinking something rational or irrational thus seems to be a matter not of inter- nalizing norms but of accepting them. V. THE NATURE OF ACCEPTANCE How might we explain the acceptance of norms as a psychological phe- nomenon? I shall only be able to give the briefest sketch of some lines for investigation that strike me as promising.</page><page sequence="14">18 Ethics October 1985 In the first place, I have distinguished "accepting" a norm from "internalizing" a norm, and so let me say briefly how I think we should understand internalizing a norm. The capacity to do so, I suggest, is one we share with other mammals, especially those who live in groups. Two dogs meeting on neutral ground will engage in elaborate "rituals," and this anthropomorphic language suggests that something akin to humans' internalizing norms may be in play. As in the human case, these animal interactions follow certain regular patterns, and the patterns seem, in a way, to have a rationale. They presumably constitute adaptations; that is to say, they are the result of natural selection favoring these patterns. Internalizing a norm, I suggest, involves tendencies toward action and emotion, tendencies that are coordinated with the tendencies of others in ways that constitute matched biological adaptations, or are the results of matched adaptations. We share the capacity to internalize norms with other animals, although the greater complexity of human social life may well mean that our capacities to internalize norms are more refined than those of any other animal.7 If that is what it is to "internalize" a norm, what is it to "accept" one? To understand acceptance, I suggest, we should look to language. Think of what language has to do with motivation, apart from simply making us aware of the states of affairs we confront. Although the most obvious function of language is to convey information, much of language is more than merely informative. Language is used to exhort, to criticize, and to summon up emotions. Language influences actions and emotions not only by conveying information that prompts those actions or emotions but in many other ways as well. A central way in which language affects human motivation is by enabling people to share a picture of an absent situation. Reactions can then be shared-not only reactions to the immediate situation but to past, future, and hypothetical situations as well. Various kinds of reactions can be expressed in various ways: emotional responses can be shared simply by evincing them. Hypothetical decisions -decisions on what to do in the place of someone who is in the situation being discussed-can be expressed in language. Emotionally laden words can be used to label actions and characters. Explicit precepts can be formulated. Discussion, then, allows for shared evaluation. A capacity for shared evaluation would be biologically fitness-en- hancing in a species with a complex social life. Those who can work out together reactions to an absent situation-what to do and what to feel- are ready for similar situations. They are better prepared than they would 7. The classic discussion of coordination in the broad sense I have in mind is Thomas Schelling, The Strategy of Conflict (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960), chap. 2. It is, of course, a theme that runs through the political theories of Hobbes and Hume. Matched adaptations are treated in John Maynard Smith's theory of "evolutionarily stable strategies" (see "The Evolution of Behavior," Scientific American 239 [1978]: 136-45, and Evolution and the Theory of Games [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982]).</page><page sequence="15">Gibbard Moral Judgment 19 otherwise be to do what is advantageous in a new situation, and they can rely on complex schemes of interpersonal coordination. On general evo- lutionary grounds, then, we might expect shared evaluation to figure centrally in a complex social life. Working out, in community, what to do, what to think, and how to feel in absent situations, if it has these biological functions, must presumably influence what we do, think, and feel when faced with like situations. It is in such control of action, belief, and emotion, I suggest, that we can find a place for phenomena that constitute acceptance of norms, as opposed merely to internalizing them. When we work out at a distance, in community, what to do or think or feel in a situation we are discussing, we come to accept norms for the situation. This is the tentative hypothesis I want to propose; I shall be calling the discussion involved "normative discussion." We evaluate in community, but part of what goes on is individual. Groups do, to be sure, reach normative consensus in many situations, but sometimes they do not. Even when consensus is reached, it may well emerge from individuals' taking positions and then, to some degree, persuading each other. Acceptance of norms is tied not only to a consensus that emerges from normative discussion but also to individuals' taking positions in normative discussion. This taking of normative positions I shall call "normative avowal." By 'avowal' here I mean to include a wide range of kinds of expression we might count as taking a position in normative discussion-in the discussion of absent states of affairs. The simplest kind might simply be the evincing of an emotion toward an absent situation. Other kinds of avowal are linguistically more explicit: we may express a hypothetical decision in words or label an action in emotively charged words. To understand acceptance of norms, we need to look to such avowal-the kind of avowal from which consensus emerges when it does and which may persist even without approach to consensus. What is the connection of avowal to acceptance? As a first approx- imation, we might say that to accept a norm is to be prepared to avow it in normative discussion-at least when the discussion is reasonably unconstrained, so that the avowal would be spontaneous rather than calculated. Acceptance, though, involves more than this; it involves a response to demands for consistency. Normative discussion consists of taking positions; even a conversational groan stakes out a position. Con- sensus may then be reached by a mechanism that is incipiently Socratic. Discussants hold each other to consistency in their positions and thus force each other to shift positions by exposing inconsistency. A person, then, must take positions in order to engage in normative discussion responsibly, and in doing so, he exposes himself to pressures toward consistency. To accept a norm, we might say, is to be disposed to avow it in unconstrained normative discussion, as a result of the workings of demands for consistency in the positions one takes in normative discussion. To prepare oneself to meet demands for consistency requires a strong imaginative life. A person will engage in imaginative rehearsal for actual</page><page sequence="16">20 Ethics October 1985 normative discussion; he practices by holding himself to consistency. I do not mean to suggest that the pressure for consistency will be as strong as it is in good philosophical discussion, but there will be some demand for consistency, and it may exert a significant pressure. From this im- aginative rehearsal, a kind of imaginative persona may emerge, an "I" who develops a consistent position to take in normative discussion. It is then, perhaps, that we can speak more clearly of what the person accepts; he then has a worked out normative position to take in unconstrained contexts. Why expose oneself to these demands for consistency? We do so naturally, but what selection pressures might have shaped us to do so? The answer should be clear from what I have said. The demands for consistency are reciprocal, and the system of mutual demands is part of a coordinating device. It is partly because of these mutual demands that there is any hope of reaching consensus in normative discussion. A person who refuses these demands must therefore be a poor candidate for co- operation of any kind-and in human life, cooperation is vital. It is fitness enhancing, then, to stand ready to engage in normative discussion and so to accept the demands for consistency that involves. In the picture I have sketched, the difference between accepting a norm and internalizing it is this. Accepting a norm is something that we do primarily in the context of normative discussion, actual and imaginary. We take positions and thereby expose ourselves to demands for consistency. Normative discussion of a situation influences action and emotion in like situations. It is then that we can speak of norms as "governing" action and emotion, and it is through this governance that normative discussion serves to coordinate. The state of accepting a norm, then, is a syndrome of tendencies toward action and avowal-a syndrome produced by the language-infused system of coordination peculiar to human beings. The system works through discussion of absent situations, and it allows for the delicate adjustments of coordination that human social life requires. Internalizing a norm is also a matter of coordinating propensities, but propensities of a different kind: these propensities work independently of normative discussion. VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS There remains much to be done before the kind of analysis I am proposing could stand much chance of seeming plausible. To call something rational, I have proposed, is to express one's acceptance of a system of norms that permits that thing. I have speculated on the psychological nature of accepting norms, in an attempt to lend plausibility to my claim that there is such a state and that it plays an important part in human life. Many other things I have not discussed. I have not talked about what it is to express a state of mind-be it belief in a straightforwardly factual prop- osition or acceptance of a system of norms. I have not said how we can</page><page sequence="17">Gibbard Moral Judgment 21 give the meaning of a term by talking about the state of mind a speaker expresses when he uses that term. Other problems will no doubt leap to mind. An observer may accept many different norms that apply to a situation, and some of these norms may weigh in opposing directions. Norms of rationality apply to a person's subjective situation, in that facts a person has no way of knowing do not affect whether an action, belief, or attitude of his is rational. A person who contemplates the rationality of another person's acts, beliefs, or emotions normally does not take himself to know everything about the other person's situation. An explanation of what it is to think an act rational does not automatically yield an account of what is involved in thinking more complicated things about rationality, such as "Samson would never do anything so irrational as that!" Handling these consid- erations will require not only elucidation of the analysis but also elaboration and revision. Moreover, I have said nothing here about a central problem for any theory of rationality: what constitutes the "objectivity" we sometimes want to attribute tojudgments of rationality. Much of what is involved in claims of objectivity for normativejudgments, I think, can be explained in terms of conversational demands in normative discussion. Normative discussion, as I have pictured it, is a communal activity: we subject ourselves to mutual influence and form a partial community of judgment. To put a judgment forth as objective, I want to say, is to make an appropriate response a requirement for membership in one's community ofjudgment or at least this gives as much of ordinary claims to objectivity as is tenable. All this, however, is for other occasions. What I have done here is to sketch part of a program. Moral judgments, I have suggested, concern the rationality of certain specifically moral emotions. Tojudge something rational is to accept a system of norms that permits it, in the circumstances as one thinks them to be. The psychological state of accepting a norm is partly to be understood in terms of the ways it underlies normative discussion. In biological terms, the capacities that underlie normative discussion are coordinating devices; they allow for the kinds of flexible, complex coordination that is peculiar to human social life. That is the rough hypothesis I have sketched in this paper, and I hope it is worth further exploration.</page></plain_text>
