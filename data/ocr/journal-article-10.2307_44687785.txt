Lange General Motors Corp Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT Although rollover crashes represent a small fraction (approximately 3%) of all motor vehicle crashes, they account for roughly one quarter of crash fatalities to occupants of cars, light trucks, and vans (NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2004(1)). Therefore, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has identified rollover injuries as one of its safety priorities. Motor vehicle manufacturers are developing technologies to reduce the risk of injury associated with rollover collisions. During a series of rollover sensor development tests conducted by General Motors, data was collected and analyzed to identify the required load and energy absorption characteristics of the ejection mitigation device used. General Motors then derived from that data a component level test that can be used to evaluate the potential of a rollover capable side air bag to mitigate the likelihood of ejection in a majority of rollover tests. This paper describes the development of the component level test as well as a subsequent assessment of the test parameters in a fixture-level evaluation. INTRODUCTION The NHTSA's 2004 Traffic Safety Facts show that while rollovers accounted for only 2.6% of all crashes (cars and LTVs), they accounted for 27.4% of fatal crashes (cars and LTVs). In addition, in all crash types, full and partial ejections accounted for 36.1% of occupant fatalities (cars and LTVs) (1). In addition, the NHTSA has characterized rollover crashes by type and severity. Figure 1 is a graph of the distribution frequency of rollover crashes for passenger cars and LTVs. Figure 1 - Distribution of rollover initiation types The frequency distributions of roll initiation type vary between cars and LTVs. With the exception of strikes by another vehicle, which are more common rollover initiators for LTVs, for both classes of vehicles, the most commonly occurring rollover events are: • Trip-over - The vehicle's lateral motion is resisted by an opposing force, inducing a rollover • Fall-over - The vehicle is tipped by a slope so that the vehicle center of gravity (CG) is outboard of the down-slope wheels • Flip-over - A forward moving vehicle is vigorously rotated about its longitudinal axis by a ramp-like object (2). Rollover severity cannot be characterized in the same straightforward manner as can rollover type. Damage pattern, initial kinetic energy, extent of rollover and other parameters could be combined to define the severity of a rollover event. A more straightforward analysis is to 151</page><page sequence="2">roughly characterize rollover severity by the number of quarter turns completed by a vehicle during a rollover event. Figure 2 shows that most rollover crashes in the U.S. are 1 full turn or less (84%). Figure 2 - Number of Rolls Rollover collisions vary in type and in severity, and occupant motion is unpredictable in rollover events. Rollover-capable roof-rail air bags are designed to help contain the head and chest of occupants and therefore reduce the risk of full or partial ejection in most rollover events. Obstructing the side glass exit portals combined with increasing seat belt usage (3) can have a positive effect on rollover injuries by mitigating ejections. Due to the unpredictability of occupant motion in rollovers, General Motors has developed a component level test to evaluate the ejection mitigation capabilities of roof-rail air bags. The data analyzed for development of the component test specifications was collected during a series of rollover sensor signature tests conducted by General Motors. BACKGROUND NHTSA TEST DEVELOPMENT In July 2000, the NHTSA published a Request for Comments proposing a guided linear impactor test to evaluate occupant retention by side window glazing in side impacts and rollovers (4). The proposal described a guided linear impactor with a mass of 18kg, a velocity of 24 km/h (6.7m/s), and an impacting surface of a Featureless Free Motion Head form (5, 6). In terms of impact locations and impactor orientation, NHTSA tests were conducted with the impactor oriented horizontally at both the centroid of the window opening and the upper rear corner of the window (5, 6). Reviewing the research on which this proposal was based reveals that the NHTSA estimated a typical side impact condition to be 9kg at 24km/h (6.7m/s), whereas a typical rollover condition was 18kg at 16.1 km/h (4.5m/s) (5, 6). During this research, NHTSA stated, "the selection of the target [impactor] energy values is critical (5)." The effective mass values were developed using pendulum tests and simulated side impact and rollover sled tests. The method used to generate effective mass was to divide the force measured in the pendulum (pendulum tests) or head and shoulder load plates (sled tests) by the acceleration of the head or torso as appropriate. The velocity values were developed from film analysis and statistical analysis of test speeds (5). In May 2003, the NHTSA published a status report on their ejection mitigation research program. This status report discusses the potential to evaluate ejection mitigation systems including inflatable systems with a guided linear impactor. NHTSA described a proposed matrix of evaluations to be performed with an 18 kg guided linear impactor at 20 and 24 km/h (5.6 and 6.7m/s) (7). At the May, 2004, 2005, and 2006 SAE Government/Industry Meeting, the NHTSA presented the status of their ejection mitigation research program (8). Performance evaluations were conducted using several types of inflatable restraints singularly and in conjunction with side window glazings. The NHTSA impact points are shown in Figure 3. The impactor had a mass of 18kg and with an impactor face of the featureless headform. Three impact scenarios were evaluated (8): Figure 3 - NHTSA Side Window Impact Locations 152</page><page sequence="3">INDUSTRY BENCHMARKED IMPACTORS Initial benchmarking of the industry showed a broad range of impactor parameters and methods. In addition, the performance criteria and allowable impactor excursion vary from test to test. The NHTSA impactor parameters and the supplier-benchmarked parameters are summarized in Table 1, sorted by kinetic energy.

Given the distribution of rollover types and severities (Figure 1 and Figure 2, above), GM selected the following rollover test conditions to evaluate dynamic vehicle parameters that are representative of a majority of the rollover crashes in the U.S.: • Curb Trip-over • Soil Trip-over • Corkscrew Ramp Flip-over • Ditch Fall-over The curb and soil trip, corkscrew ramp, and ditch fallover test conditions simulate the majority of rollover crashes in terms of initiation type (Figure 1) for both passenger cars and LTVs. The vehicles in these tests rolled up to 2 quarter turns, so in terms of severity as defined by quarter turns achieved, (Figure 2) the trip, corkscrew and ditch tests represent the majority of rollovers quantified by severity. Although SAE J2114 dolly rollovers do not represent a field initiation type for rollover crashes, dolly rollovers were conducted and evaluated for the analysis, due to the existence of this predefined test procedure.. Laboratory-based dynamic rollover tests in the above configurations were performed on a mid-size car, a mid- size sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a full-size SUV. Hybrid III 50* percentile anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) were placed in the front outboard seating positions of all tests. Both belted and unbelted ATDs were included in the test series. The ATDs are referred to by the position on the leading side or trailing side of the vehicle in the following analysis. The ATDs were instrumented to measure head accelerations, neck loads, and chest accelerations. Additionally, the vehicles were fitted with fabric membranes over the front side window openings. The attachments of these membranes were instrumented to measure the time history of loads applied by ATD contacts during the test event. This paper describes the approach taken by GM for development of a proposed set of criteria for a component level ejection mitigation test based on the data generated in the rollover sensor development test series. CHARACTERIZATION OF DATASET Fifty-seven laboratory rollover tests were conducted for development of laboratory based rollover sensor signature test methods. All 57 tests were evaluated for use in the development of the component test energy parameters. Of the 57 tests evaluated for this study, 5 of tests were ultimately excluded for mass and velocity analysis due to • Un-instrumented ATDs installed in multiple tests of deformed vehicles (2 tests) • Occupant kinematics precluded calculation of mass (3 tests) Data from the three dolly rollovers were used for confirmation of selection of test parameters. The tests included in the mass and velocity analysis had a similar distribution of rollover initiation types to that shown in Figure 1. The comparison between the field rollover initiation types and the initiation method for the tests under analysis is shown in Figure 4, showing the similar distribution. Figure 4 - Rollover Initiation Type - Field vs. Test 153</page><page sequence="4">In terms of peak roll angle, just under half of the tests included in the analysis achieved less than % turn while the remaining tests achieved 1 or 2 quarter turns, as shown in Figure 5. The tests that achieved less than % turn were not excluded from the analysis because these tests showed relatively high ATD velocities relative to the vehicle due to the motion of the ATD continuing up and outboard while the vehicle was falling back down on to the wheels. Additionally, Half of the tests, or 26 of 52, had belted ATDs and half of the tests had unbelted ATDs. Figure 5 - Number of Quarter Turns Achieved FULL VEHICLE TEST SET-UP Instrumentation Membranes were placed over the left front and right front windows with triaxial load cells installed at the corner mounting locations. An example of the membrane with load cells drawn in is shown in Figure 6. Accelerometers were placed in various locations on the vehicle to collect vehicle rollover sensor signature data. Typical accelerometer locations are shown in Figure 7. In addition, angular rate sensors measuring roll, yaw, and pitch were placed near the center of gravity of the vehicle. In addition, the left and right rear seats were removed for camera coverage. Figure 6 - Window Membrane Example Figure 7 - Instrumentation Location Example Instrumentation on the ATDs included: • Head and chest accelerations • Neck forces and moments • Seat belt loads (on tests with belted ATDs) 154</page><page sequence="5">Onboard Camera Coverage Five onboard cameras were installed in the positions shown in Figure 8. Views 4 and 5 were intended for ATD head kinematics analysis. Figure 8 - Camera Locations DATA ANALYSIS The goal of the data analysis was to develop data-driven ejection mitigation test parameters based on the kinetic energy of the ATD that is absorbed by the window membrane, and would therefore need to be absorbed by a roof-rail airbag, during the rollover sensor signature tests. KINETIC ENERGY ANALYSIS OVERVIEW The kinetic energy of a system, or KE, is defined as the sum of kinetic energies of the particles that make up the system. This relationship is defined mathematically in Equation 1 . Equation 1 - Kinetic Energy Relationship KE = ^m,vf /=1 where m¡ = mass of the component particle v, = velocity of the component particle For a system with the frame of reference defined at the center of mass of the system, the kinetic energy of the system can be derived as the sum of • the kinetic energy of the mass center of the system, which is a function of the total mass of the system and the velocity of the system at the center of mass of the system and • the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles making up the system as they move with respect to the center of mass of the system, which can be represented by evaluating the discrete masses and velocities of the particles or by representing the system of particles by a moment of inertia about the center of mass that is rotating at a given rate (9). Applying the kinetic energy relationship to the ATD in a rollover event and treating the ATD as a system of particles that are rotating and translating about the center of mass of the dummy, the kinetic energy of the dummy is the sum of • the kinetic energy of the mass center of the ATD and • the sum of the kinetic energies of the parts of the ATD as they move with respect to the center of mass of the ATD. The total kinetic energy of the ATD is a function of the motion of the ATD relative to ground. In the analysis described in this paper, the area of interest was the kinetic energy of the portion of the dummy contacting and restrained by the membrane as opposed to the kinetic energy of the entire ATD. This contacting portion of the ATD was assumed to be a body (particle) as a part of a system of bodies with an associated mass, velocity and kinetic energy. Therefore, for the analysis, the kinetic energy is reduced to Equation 2 Equation 2 - ATD Kinetic Energy where F = force vectors acting on the head m = mass of the head = translational acceleration vector of the center of gravity of the head The goal of the analysis was to generate the kinetic energy of the ATD portion that was restrained by the window membrane. The velocity term in the kinetic energy evaluation was the peak resultant outboard velocity of the head relative to the vehicle; whereas, in a linear impactor test, the velocity is defined as purely lateral. In general, the peak velocity occurred at the time of initial contact with the window membrane. The mass term was the effective mass of the leading side ATD applied to the leading side window membrane as the membrane was loaded through the head of the ATD. In cases where the unbelted trailing side occupant contacted the leading side occupant during leading side occupant loading to the window membrane, the two occupants acted as one body and the calculated effective mass is a combination of both occupants. The time at which the effective mass was calculated is the time of maximum head displacement, where the head velocity is zero and a peak occurs in the window membrane loads. 155</page><page sequence="6">In a small number of cases, the leading side ATD appeared to contact the leading side window membrane directly (not loading through the leading side ATD) late in the event after contact had occurred with the leading side ATD. These trailing side ATD membrane contacts were difficult to analyze due to the difficulty in seeing film targets used for onboard ATD velocity analysis. In three cases, the trailing side ATD to leading side membrane contacts could be evaluated separately and these have been included in the analysis. ATP Velocity Determination To evaluate the ATD kinetic energy absorbed by the window membrane, the velocity of the ATD relative to the membrane was required. For the 46 of the 52 leading side ATDs, the head velocity was calculated through onboard film kinematics analysis. Lateral and vertical components of ATD head velocity with respect to the vehicle were generated using the TrackEye™ Motion Analysis System. Peak resultant velocities were calculated in the inboard and outboard directions. The peak resultant outboard velocity of the leading side ATD head was used for kinetic energy calculations. ATD head kinematics could not be determined in a subset of tests due to a lack of reference points and/or difficulty in specifying the point to track due to the aiming of the onboard light. For six of the 52 leading side ATDs in belted tripped rollover tests, the head velocity was estimated by integrating and subtracting the ATD head acceleration from the vehicle center of gravity acceleration. These estimated velocities are expected to have some variance due to rotation of the respective frames of references of the two locations, however, because head contact to the window membrane occurred relatively early in the event, this method was judged acceptable for this subset of tests. Of the five trailing side ATDs that appeared to contact the leading side window membrane directly, onboard film kinematics analysis of occupant velocity just prior to membrane contact was possible for three ATDs. The velocity for remaining two ATDs could not be determined because film targets were not visible due to ATD position. ATP Mass Analysis Overview The next step in determining the kinetic energy of the ATD relative to the window membrane was to determine an effective mass of the ATD. The assumption was made that the reaction force of the ATD was applied through head contact. This method essentially consists of developing a free body diagram of the ATD head, Figure 9, where the forces acting on the head are the contact force, the neck force and the forces due to acceleration. The contact force in this analysis was due to head contact to the window membrane and/or to rigid structures in the vehicle like the roof rail. The neck force was assumed to be a function of the mass and acceleration of the body of the ATD below the neck. Contact &gt;'force m head9 h^d ( ' ^ ^ J A Neck 'force Figure 9 - Free body diagram - ATD head The goal of this portion of the analysis was to determine the portion of the ATD mass below the head that was combined with the head mass during loading of the window membrane, which was a generic surrogate for a curtain airbag. The contact force due to loading other rigid structures was to be excluded from this analysis. 156</page><page sequence="7">Newton's second law of motion states that if the resultant force action on a particle is non-zero, then the particle will have an acceleration that is proportional to the magnitude of the non-zero force. Applying Newton's second law of motion to the ATD head means that the sum of the forces acting on the ATD head, including the neck reaction forces is equal to the product of the mass of the head and the translational acceleration of the head. This relationship is defined mathematically in Equation 3 (10). Equation 3 - Sum of Forces on ATD Head where F = force vectors acting on the head m = mass of the head â„ = translational acceleration vector of oy the center of gravity of the head Substituting the head acceleration vectors and the upper neck loads results in Equation 4 (10): Equation 4 - External Head Contact Force F ' = IF2 +F2 1 ' +F2 1 ' ' head _cont ' xhead 1 ' yhead 1 ' zhead where ^ ~ xhead - a xhead ^ effhead ~ ^ xneck ^ yhead ~ a yhead ^ effhead ~ ^ yneck F~zhead ~ &amp; zhead ^ effhead ~ ^ zneck and Fhead _cont = Resultant external head contact force [N] axhead - Longitudinal head acceleration (from accelerometer) [m/s] a yhead = Lateral head acceleration (from accelerometer) [m/s] azhead = Vertical head acceleration (from accelerometer) [m/s] meffhead = Effective mass of head (Mass of head minus mass of neck load cell below center of gravity of head) [kg] m effhead = 4.204 kg for Hybrid III 50th percentile ATD Fxneck = Longitudinal force of neck on head from upper neck load cell [N] Fyneck = Lateral force of neck on head from upper neck load cell [N] Fzneck = Vertical force of neck on head from upper neck load cell [N] 157</page><page sequence="8">Mass Analysis The effective ATD mass applied to the window membrane ("Effective Mass" or mefftotal, Equation 5) was calculated using the head contact force, the resultant head acceleration and the resultant chest acceleration using the following relationship.

Three of the 5 tests that were excluded from the analysis were excluded due to occupant motion relative to the vehicle such that the head of the ATD contacted the roof instead of the window membranes. These three tests were dolly rollover tests conducted to the SAE J2114 procedure. An example of this kind of occupant motion is shown in Figure 10. Without direct head to window membrane contact, the free-body diagram and the mathematical relationships derived above can not be applied to the ATD effective mass analysis. Figure 10 - ATD Kinematics - Dolly Rollover Test 158</page><page sequence="9">Analysis Discussion The analysis documented in this paper was performed primarily on the leading side ATD. During belted tests, only the leading side ATD contacted the leading side window membrane. During the 23 of 26 of unbelted tests, the trailing side ATD contacted the leading side ATD during it's loading of the leading side window membrane and the effective mass calculated reflects the combined loading of both ATDs. Finally, during five of 26 unbelted tests, after contacting the leading side ATD, the trailing side ATD contacted the leading side window membrane and could be analyzed separately. EXAMPLE TEST - EFFECTIVE MASS ANALYSIS The following section will illustrate the steps taken in analyzing the 52 tests documented in this paper using an example test. The example test is an unbelted soil trip sled test during which the vehicle rolled Vi turn and achieved a peak roll angle of 137°. The test had several occupant contact events, summarized as follows: • Leading side ATD contacted leading side window membrane • Trailing side ATD contacted leading side ATD • Leading side ATD contacted leading side window membrane • Trailing side ATD contacted leading side window membrane A summary chart of the example test is shown in Figure 1 1 . The summary chart is a tool used to develop a one- page snapshot of the rollover test event. Across the x- axis is time in milliseconds. Each dot shows the time at which a peak load occurred during the event. The data labels for the peak describe the load channel shown. Data labels in bold show peak loads that exceeded the injury assessment reference value. Screen shots of the vehicle and test dummy orientation at the time at which an injury assessment reference value is exceeded are also included. Data labels in italics show events estimated from film analysis. The y-axis is the roll angle of the vehicle - referring to the curve shown on the summary chart. In this particular example, two Injury Assessment Reference Values (lARVs) were exceeded on the trailing side ATD during head contact to the ground through the leading side window membrane.

Figure 16 shows that initially, the window membrane loading is due to leading side ATD contact only (a). This is visible through both the onboard film as well as the time history shapes of the window membranes and leading side ATD head contact force. At (b), the trailing ATD contacts the leading side ATD shoulder and shows a resulting increase in the trailing side ATD head contact force. At (c), the leading side and trailing side ATDs are loading the leading side window membrane as a coupled mass, calculated at 25.8kg.

Figure 17 shows that again at (d), the window membrane loading is due to leading side ATD contact only, again visible in the onboard film as well as time history data. At this point in time, the vehicle is continuing to rotate and fall from under the ATDs. At (e), the trailing ATD contacts the leading side window membrane directly, with a trailing side effective mass of 10.3kg. 162</page><page sequence="13">Figure 17 - Example trailing side analysis Figure 18 zooms in on the events shown in box (III) in Figure 15 with the addition of screen shots of the vehicle orientation and ATD orientation at key times during the event.

The peak leading side ATD head contact force (g) occurs slightly later in the test when the leading side ATD head contacts the roofrail and the ground. Figure 18 - Example contact force to ground 163</page><page sequence="14">Additional Mass Analysis Methods Evaluated for Confirmation of Effective Mass Calculation Three additional methods for calculating effective ATD mass were evaluated for comparison to the Newton's Second Law method used in the previous section. The three methods were: • Newton's third law • Principle of work and energy • Principle of impulse and momentum Newton's Third Law Newton's third law states that for each action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. An attempt was made to apply this relationship to the leading side window membranes. The membranes were attached to the vehicle structure at the corners of the window openings with tri-axis load cells installed at the attachments. Ideally, the window membrane would be a rigid plane and the load cells mounted at the four corner attachments of the window membranes would be mounted planar to each other and with the force axes in alignment with the principle axes of the vehicle. Figure 19, looking outboard from the interior of the vehicle, shows the ideal load cell mounting with X axis of the load cell axis aligned with the vertical axis of the vehicle, the Y axis of the load cell aligned with the lateral axis of the vehicle and the Z axis of the load cell aligned with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

This could allow the effect of head contact with other vehicle structures to be easily excluded and could allow for analysis independent of the part of the body contacting the window. In reality, however, the load cells were not mounted planar to each other or with the force axes in alignment with the principle axes of the vehicle. The mounting of the load cells with the positive orientation of the loads, looking outboard from the interior of the vehicle was approximately as shown in Figure 20. The specific orientation varied from test to test. 2^ r ' 4 Figure 20 - Actual Membrane Load Cell Placement In an effort to understand the effect of load cell orientation on the recorded forces, vector sums of the forces in the X and Z directions were calculated. As shown above, these vector sums should have added to zero. The vector sums in the X and Z directions were in the range of +/- 200N. In addition, some tests had load cell channel data anomalies like loose wires which confounded direct analyses of the load cell data. Due to the data integrity issues above, all calculations of dummy contact and reactions used the contact force on the ATD head as opposed to the resultant membrane fastener loads. The time histories of the leading side resultant membrane attachment loads were analyzed along with leading side ATD kinematics. Resultant membrane loads correspond to periods of ATD contact with the membrane established through film analysis. 164</page><page sequence="15">The resultant membrane loads were used to understand the reaction force in the membrane acting to restrain the ATD during these contact periods as well as to understand the magnitude of loads at the attachments. Principle of Work and Energy The second additional method evaluated for determining appropriate energy levels for a component level impactor test was the principle of work and energy. The principle of work and energy states the work of the force acting on a particle during displacement of the particle is equal to the integral of the force over the displacement interval and is equal to the kinetic energy of the particle as follows: Equation 7 - Principle of Work and Energy jFdx = 'mv2 where F = force x = displacement m = mass v = velocity The benefit to using this method is that it would remove any data issues due to vehicle and dummy rotation during a rollover event. In applying this relationship to the rollover sensor development tests, one could, in theory, integrate the head contact force versus the displacement of the head into the membrane during the contact event. Several attempts to use this method were made. In all cases the head target used for film analysis of displacement was obscured by the B-plllar soon after head contact with the membrane. Head accelerometer data could not be double integrated due to vehicle motion in a rotating frame of reference. Principle of Impulse and Momentum The principle of impulse and momentum offered a third potential method of determining mass, velocity and energy values in the rollover sensor development tests. The principle says that the impulse of a force on a particle over a given time is equal to the mass of the particle multiplied by the change in velocity of the particle over the interval, or: Equation 8 - Principle of Impulse and Momentum jřdt = mAv where F = force t = time m = mass Âv = change in velocity This method involved integrating the resultant head contact force versus time and then dividing the result by the head velocity. The impulse-momentum method was evaluated on a subset of the test data that included the majority of the tripped events. These events were evaluated because the occupant motion in the initial portion of the events was primarily lateral and the initial contact of the occupant was with the window membrane, not a rigid structure on the vehicle. The interval over which to integrate was quite difficult to determine. For this evaluation, the interval used was the time of initial head contact with the window membrane to the time of peak membrane load. Figure 21 shows a comparison of the effective mass values calculated using the Newton's Second Law (F=ma method) to the Impulse-momentum method. In general, the values calculated were similar using both methods. In point 16, however, the effective mass value calculated using the Newton's second law method was over 30kg higher than the effective mass calculated with the impulse-momentum method. Figure 22 illustrates the time history data for point 16 in Figure 21. This figure highlights the difficulties in performing the evaluations described in this paper. In this particular event, an unbelted trip test that achieved a 32° peak roll angle and landed on the wheels, the effective mass calculated at the time of peak membrane loads was 40kg. However, slightly later in the test, a peak effective mass was calculated to be 85kg. To maintain a robust analysis of the data, in tests such as these, the peak effective mass was used instead of the effective mass calculated at the time of peak membrane loads. This example also demonstrates the need to include tests that achieve less than one quarter turn in a data analysis of this kind. 165</page><page sequence="16">Figure 21 - Effective Mass Comparison - Newton's Second Law vs. Impulse-Momentum Figure 22 - 84kg Example - Unbelted trip, 32° peak roll angle 166</page><page sequence="17">Summary of Kinetic Energy Values and Discussion Figure 23 shows a plot comparing the calculated leading side ATD kinetic energy for each test under analysis relative to lines of constant kinetic energy. Each point represents a single leading side ATD in a single test, with an additional point representing the impactor parameters chosen for the component level test. It is evident that the tests with unbelted ATDs and combined leading and trailing side ATD loading into the leading side window membrane show the highest mass values, and the tests with belted ATDs show the highest velocity values. What is most revealing, however, is that the kinetic energy values calculated for these cases are similar. Figure 23 summarizes the dataset in terms of kinetic energy, not necessarily in terms of absolute mass and velocity values. It illustrates the need to focus on energy level requirements for an ejection mitigation countermeasure as opposed to choosing mass and velocity values independent of kinetic energy levels. Figure 23 - Kinetic Energy Value Summary - Leading Side 167</page><page sequence="18">Discussion - Mass Figure 24 shows a comparison of the mass values generated for the ATDs by restraint type. As stated previously, the mass values calculated for the belted ATDs are smaller than those calculated for the unbelted ATDs and typically reflect only the head of the ATD. The mass values calculated for the unbelted ATD tests Is typically a coupled mass of the leading and trailing ATDs loading into the window membrane through the leading side ATD. Figure 24 - Mass Bar Chart Discussion - Velocity Figure 25 shows a comparison of the velocity values generated for the ATDs by restraint type. Again, the belted ATDs showed the highest velocities. This is due to the fact that in the belted cases, the head is essentially bobbing on the neck while the rest of the ATD is restrained. In the unbelted cases, however, the velocities are generally lower due to the energy required to overcome the inertia) effects of moving the entire unbelted ATD. Figure 25 - Velocity Bar Chart Discussion - Energy Figure 26 shows a comparison of the kinetic energy levels calculated for both belted and unbelted ATDs. The majority of tests had kinetic energy values below 100J, and all are below 180J. Figure 26 - Kinetic Energy Bar Chart Selection of impactor parameters The selection of impactor parameters was based on energy level. The selected kinetic energy values needed to be higher than those generated during the rollover sensor signature tests. The exact mass and velocity values were less important than the resulting kinetic energy value. Impactor parameter values of 4.5 m/s and 18kg were chosen because • The mass of 18kg is consistent with the mass used by NHTSA in ejection mitigation research. • They are consistent with the rollover data presented by NHTSA for the development of a side glazing impactor specification. • The kinetic energy value of 182J is greater than the highest kinetic energy value generated in the rollover sensor development tests. • 4.5 m/s is greater than the majority of peak head velocity values • 18 kg is greater than the majority of calculated effective mass values 168</page><page sequence="19">Discussion - Leading Side Window Membrane Loads Figure 27 is a plot of calculated kinetic energy versus the peak resultant corner membrane loads for the tests under analysis. The three dolly rollover tests for which a kinetic energy value could not be calculated had peak resultant membrane corner loads that were within the range of the loads generated on tests for which the kinetic energy values could be calculated. Therefore, although the occupant motion in the three dolly rollover tests precluded the calculation of kinetic energy values, this analysis shows that the window membrane loading in these tests lies within the range of all tests. It can, therefore, be inferred that the kinetic energy values calculated for the 52 tests encompass the kinetic energy of the ATDs in the three dolly rollover tests. The lower front peak load of 1879N in Figure 27 was due to an instrumentation malfunction in the load cell channel. The peak load prior to the instrumentation malfunction was 76N. Figure 27 - Calculated Kinetic Energy vs. Peak Resultant Corner Membrane Loads 169</page><page sequence="20">Trailing side ATD analysis The leading side ATD contacted the leading side window membrane in all tests and the time at which contact occurred was clear from the test data and films. The motion of the trailing side ATD, however, was complex and confounded by contact with the leading side ATD and the vehicle interior. As stated previously, five trailing side ATDs appeared to directly contact the leading side window membrane. Unfortunately, onboard kinematics analysis of the occupant velocity just prior to contact could be calculated for only three of the five cases due to loss of visibility of film targets. Figure 28 shows the effective mass values calculated for these three cases and the resulting kinetic energy values compared to the data calculated from the leading side ATD, Figure 23. Figure 28 - Kinetic Energy Comparison - With Trailing Side Data Two of these three kinetic energy values were less than the kinetic energy value chosen for the guided linear impactor test. In one case, however, the calculated kinetic energy value was greater than that chosen for the linear impactor test. The summary chart for this one test is shown in Figure 29. In this test, the neck compression duration is 171% at the time of membrane contact by the trailing side ATD. This loading on the ATD occurs through contact with the window membrane only - not through contact with the ground through the membrane. In this case, although the occupant is contained and the window membrane absorbs 243J of kinetic energy, the loading ATD experiences a contact with the membrane during which an injury assessment reference value is exceeded. 170</page><page sequence="21">Figure 29 - 243J Trailing Side Kinetic Energy Event IMPACT POINTS Contact Location from Data Analysis The location of the maximum resultant leading side window membrane attachment load in each test was determined and analyzed. Figure 30 shows that the majority of maximum resultant membrane attachment loads occur at the rear attachments with 43% of the maximum loads occurring at the upper rear corner and 33% occurring at the lower rear corner. These data lead to the conclusion that the most frequently impacted area is in the rear of the window opening for a Hybrid III 50th percentile ATD. Figure 30 - Location of Maximum Resultant Leading Side Window Membrane Attachment Load 171</page><page sequence="22">Contact location from film analysis Fifty-three of 55 leading side ATDs contacted the leading side window opening membrane in the upper rear quadrant of the window opening. Two of 55 contacted the lower rear quadrant of the window opening. Three trailing side ATDs appeared to contact the leading side window opening membrane in the lower front quadrant and two appeared to contact the upper front quadrant. The remaining trailing side ATDs did not appear to contact the leading side window opening membrane independently. IMPACTOR TEST IMPACT POINTS Upper Rear Impact Point The upper rear impact point represents the most frequently impacted location by leading side ATDs in the full vehicle rollover sensor development tests. In addition, in rollover events in general, the rotation of the vehicle causes the occupant to move up and outward toward the roof rail. The upper rear impact point also bounds the rear-most seating position and taller occupants. This point is consistent with NHTSA impact point 4. The upper rear impact point is the upper and most rearward point within the front side window opening into which the head form can fit with 25mm clearance down from the top edge of the window opening and 25mm clearance forward from the rear edge of the window opening. An example of the upper rear impact point location is shown in Figure 31 . Figure 31 - Upper Rear Impact Point Center Impact Point The centroid of the window opening is location that is expected to have the least boundary condition support by the window frame and vehicle structure. The center impact point is the centroid of the window opening. The center of gravity of the impactor is to be placed at the center impact point. An example of the center impact point is shown in Figure 32. Figure 32 - Center Impact Point Lower Front Projected Impact Point The lower front projected impact point represents the location at which trailing side ATDs contacted the leading side window membrane. In addition, the lower front point bounds the front seating position for smaller occupants. The lower front projected impact point is defined as the center of gravity of a 5th percentile female head, adjusted in the full forward longitudinal and mid vertical seat position with the seat back angle rotated 10 degrees forward from design position, and with a 30 degree longitudinal projection. The center of gravity of the impactor is to be placed at the lower front projected impact point. An example of the lower front projected impact point is shown in Figure 33. Figure 33 - Lower Front Projected Impact Point For all impact locations, it must be ensured that there is at least 25mm of clearance from any point on the impactor face to the vehicle structure. IMPACTOR TYPE The guided linear impactor was chosen for the component level tests due to the repeatability of impact velocity and impact location as well as to harmonize with NHTSA ejection mitigation research. Additionally, this 172</page><page sequence="23">impactor is available at most air bag suppliers and test facilities. The impactor tests are to be performed with the impactor oriented parallel to ground. This consistent orientation is intended to give repeatable results and allows for comparison among various designs. IMPACTOR SHAPE In the rollover sensor signature tests, the side of the ATD head was the part of the ATD that contacted the window membrane most frequently. The impactor face was therefore chosen to be the side of the 50th percentile ATD which represents an average sized person. For flexibility at air bag suppliers and test facilities, a MADYMO simulation was used to make a comparison between the results generated using the side and the front of the 50th percentile ATD head as the impactor face on a non-production intent air bag. The results showed that using either the side or the front of the ATD head, or a featureless free motion head form for the impactor face had no effect on peak impactor displacement. IMPACT TIME Based on 2001-2005 NASS CDS weighted rollover data from tow away crashes, Figure 2, 84% of field rollover events are one complete roll or less. The average time to complete one roll in rollover sensor development tests with multiple rolls is about 1500ms. The time of contact between the guided linear impactor and the air bag is defined as 1500ms after air bag deployment. Since the rollover capable side air bag will deploy some milliseconds after the rollover event begins, the 1500ms component level impact time represents a time after the vehicle has achieved at least one full roll. The 1500ms impact time combine with pressure and stand-time requirements to help to provide ejection mitigation in a rollover event. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: For all impact points, 'Integrity' and 'Containment' must be demonstrated. These are defined as follows: • Integrity: When the inflated rollover capable side air bag is impacted with the impactor, the air bag does not exhibit any tears and the air bag fasteners remain attached to the vehicle structure. • Containment: When the inflated rollover capable side air bag is impacted with the impactor, motion of the impactor is arrested by the air bag prior to the end of impactor stroke. The impactor may not go over, under, or through the air bag. The upper rear impact point has an additional 'Excursion' requirement, defined as: • Excursion: When the inflated rollover capable side air bag is impacted with the impactor, the maximum impactor excursion does not exceed 100 mm outside the plane of the vehicle. The excursion limit of 100 mm outside the plane of the vehicle was chosen because it is approximately half the height of the Hybrid-Ill 50th percentile ATD head. The plane of the vehicle is defined as longitudinal plane, tangent to the outermost vehicle structure at lateral section cut through the vehicle at the upper rear impact point. An example of an excursion plane is shown in Figure 34 . Figure 34 - Excursion Planes CONFIRMATION STUDIES To confirm the acceptability of the impactor parameter values of 18 kg and 4.5 m/s, a set of MADYMO analyses were performed comparing resultant corner window membrane loads from a rollover test to those in a component level test. The resultant membrane attachment loads generated using the component level test parameters were, on average, higher than those generated in the rollover tests and simulations. A subsequent confirmation study was conducted using a linear impactor impacting a window membrane in a cut- away vehicle body. The study goal was to compare the membrane corner loads generated during linear impactor tests conducted to the GM energy level to those generated during the study. In addition, an evaluation of the membrane corner loads generated with an energy level target of 404J in the NHTSA impact points (Figure 3). The membranes used for these tests were existing membranes that were used for rollover sensing tests. 173</page><page sequence="24">A second series of tests were conducted with unused window membranes due to concerns about the fidelity of evaluating membranes that had been used repeatedly in full scale testing as well as due to the variation in the test speeds in the first series. The test matrix for both series is shown in Table 2. All tests were conducted with an 18kg guided linear impactor. Table 2 - Component Test Matrix Series 1 Series 2 Impactor Impactor Kinetic Kinetic Energy Peak Energy Peak Achieved Impactor Achieved Impactor Impact Description [J] Force [N] [J] Force [N] 182J, Upper Rear Point ~ 193 4185 199 3977 182 J, Center Point ~ 176 ~090 190 4056 182J, Lower Front Projected Point 189 4432 199 3583 404J, Lower Front Point (NHTSA Point 1) 400 4856 428 7996 404J, Lower Middle Point (NHTSA Point 2) 403 7134 428 6897 404J, Upper Front Point (NHTSA Point 3) 398 4909 428 4012 404J, Upper Rear Point (NHTSA Point 4) 405 5721 428 7081 The membrane ripped at the attachments in each of the component level tests during the first series. In series 1, the membrane was completely re-sewn at the attachments prior to the test conduced at NHTSA point 2. The membrane attachments ripped during the last three tests (NHTSA points 2, 3, and 4) during the second test series with unused membranes. The membrane did not appear to rip in any of the full vehicle rollover sensor signature tests. Figure 35 shows the membrane corner loads generated during this set of tests compared to those generated in the rollover sensor signature tests (Figure 27). Figure 36 shows a simplified version of the data with one point for each test showing the average of the four peak resultant membrane loads. The loads generated in the component level tests at a target energy level of 182J were on average higher than those generated in the rollover sensor signature test series. The loads generated in the tests at a target energy level of 404J were significantly higher than those generated in full vehicle tests. Figure 35 - Membrane Load Component Test Results 174</page><page sequence="25">Figure 36 - Average Peak Resultant Membrane Load As shown in Table 2 and Figure 36, the membrane loads and impactor forces are higher In the 404J tests than in the 182J tests. There is some variation from test to test in loading that may be due to the hand-made nature of the window membranes. The average force for the 182J tests is 3887N while the average force for the 404J tests is 6076 J. GM COMPONENT LEVEL TEST SPECIFICATION GM proposes the following test specifications to evaluate the potential for side air bags to mitigate the likelihood of ejection in rollover events. • Impactor Kinetic Energy: 182.25J • Impactor Mass: 18kg • Impactor Velocity: 4.5m/s • Impactor Type: Guided Linear Impactor, oriented parallel to ground • Impactor Shape: Front or side of 50th percentile head or free motion headform Impact Locations on Window Opening: • Upper rear • Centroid • Projected lower front • Impact Time: 1 500ms after air bag deployment • Performance Metrics: • All points: Air bag integrity and impactor containment • Upper rear point only: Impactor excursion less that 100 mm outside plane of vehicle CONCLUSION The goal of deploying rollover capable side air bags in rollover events is to mitigate the likelihood of ejection during a rollover. To evaluate the ability of rollover capable side air bags to improve the mitigate ejection in rollover events; GM has developed a repeatable linear impactor test methodology. This study was an analysis of a defined body of rollover sensor development tests. As rollover sensing and protection systems continue to be developed and refined, the analysis of field data and experimental data can continue to expand on this work. 175</page><page sequence="26">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of Christopher Horn, Catherine Glowicki, and Lisa Stacey in the development of these component test specifications, and Stephen Cassatta for assistance in developing the linear impactor confirmation studies.
