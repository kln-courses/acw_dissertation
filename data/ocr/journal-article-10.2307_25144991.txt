Introduction: 'Lessons of the Pasfr Every four years the tenor and tempo of American political rhetoric intensify as the presidential election cycle reaches one of its periodic climaxes. Invariably the language of the rival candidates and their parties emphasizes the novel and special contribution they will bring to the constant renewal which is the central theme of the Great American Narrative.2 Embattled incumbents and aspirant new candi dates alike will find words to connect the future to the past by way of the present Ernest R.

So who better in 2008 to lead the most powerful country in the world than a man whose person represents white Middle America, black Africa and a Pacific archipelago, while currently serving as US senator for Midwestern Illinois? Or alternatively a candidate who has served for decades in the Senate, an acknowledged war hero, himself born of military stock in a colonial outpost in Central America, the Panama Canal Zone, a legacy of the short-lived, European-style imperialism that characterized the American 'emergence to world power' in the pivotal years at the end of the nineteenth century?4 Likewise the running mates of Barack Obama and John McCain have provided different but complementary balances: Senator Joe Biden, the old-style Washington insider from Atlantic-seaboard Delaware, one of the signatory states of the 1776 Declaration of Independence and 1789 Federal Consti tution, offered the classic sectional counterpoint to Obama, while the nomina tion of Susan Palin, a definite Washington outsider, was designed to meet the social and economic desiderata of conservative voters sceptical about McCain's liberal lapses?not to forget her being governor of vast, sparsely populated but geologically rich Pacific-coast Alaska, which along with Obama's Hawaii was one of the last two states to join the Union in 1959 to form the present-day 50 United States.5 It is implausible to think that individuals will cast their votes by a subtle calcula tion of these factors; yet it is impossible to deny that such calculations did go into the nomination of the candidates and will shape the electoral outcome. What we see is the moulding of a political landscape, the creation of an atmosphere in which a single electoral decision is made; but these are landscapes and atmospheres which already have a discernible nature. Using their understanding of the past and present, and trying to gauge the electorate's collective hopes for the future, candidates and their teams try to blend this sense with that of the voters to produce the desired result. As McCain's campaign manager commented: 'This election is not about issues. This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates.' In political terms the goal is elected office. For authors of political and historical texts, something similar is at work: finding the language to engage the reader; appealing to a shared vision of the past and the hoped-for future; and, more often than not, trying to learn from others' mistakes and successes: what may be thought of as the writer's political platform. These dos and don'ts will then be internalized by the readers, whether in public and professional life or as concerned, politically active citizens; and so the civic tradition will be handed on. Not one of the six books under review aims to influence the outcome of the 2008 presidential and congressional elections by endorsing a particular candidate; but all the authors 3 This year, of course, is an 'open' presidential election, when no incumbent is on the ticket. 4 For the debate on the American 'emergence to world power', see Michael Dunne, 'US foreign relations in the twentieth century: from world power to global hegemony', International Affairs 76: 1, Jan. 2000, pp. 25?40, esp. pp. 27-30. 5 On the 'gender issue' see Michael Dunne, 'Black and white unite?

Six works in the twentieth-century landscape The history of US foreign relations may be conveniently described in seven broad stages: the period between the Revolution and the enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, which divided the world politically into two hemispheres; the years until the end of the Civil War in 1865, after which American territorial expan sion would not involve the spread of slavery; the years until the First World War, during which the Great Debate at the turn of the century posed and ambiguously answered the question as to the nature of the American overseas empire; the years between the First and Second World Wars, when the dominant issue was whether the growth of American economic and political power could be maintained essen tially on unilateralist terms (misleadingly called 'isolationism'); the half-century following, which saw the combination of American unilateralism and multilater alism, which may be described as Cold War internationalism, in a struggle for the 'great globe itself; and finally the two short stages which successively consisted of the decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union and then the period since 9/n.7 Of course, all such periodization is problematical; and the debate continues on the paradigmatic shift registered by the 9/11 attacks. Even so, the authors before us work within this rough seven-part framework, without committing themselves to the characterizations offered. We find a significant difference in John Bolton and Robert Kagan, who wish to recall to their readers' minds the Westphalian system of state sovereignty established in the mid-seventeenth century. Their purpose is not to challenge the chronology of this schema but rather to insist upon the appropriate American action for the future. A far longer perspective is offered very briefly by David Reynolds, who in an early paragraph begins the history of summits in the lands between the Nile and Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago. Thereafter Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years War appear in his tour d'horizon, which takes us to the three meetings between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in a fortnight during September 1938 that have gone down in history as 'Munich'. Europeans, west and east, remembering and seeking to avoid repeating the 'horrific conflicts of the twentieth century' are key players in Kagan's essay on world politics since the collapse of the Soviet Union; and there remains a strong line in American historiography depicting Munich and appeasement as bringing about the particular horrors of the Second World War.9 (The fashionable resurrection of 7 William C.

Tagging such critics with the appeasement label might cow them into conformity?as anti-appeaser and later Vietnam critic Senator J. William Fulbright eventually realized.11 Among the 'horrors' of twentieth-century Europe was the Holocaust, a term of terrible yet imprecise resonance that has become synonymous with the genocide of the European Jews as the target of the Nazis' Final Solution. In the three other books under review, which deal to a greater or lesser extent with the creation and existence of the state of Israel, only that by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt discusses the Holocaust, and then in order to address the question of US relations with Israel and the criticism this relationship has provoked. The two other books have a different purpose. Negotiating Arab?Israeli peace is a vade mecum, a primer of 'lessons learned and relearned' (pp. 25-73) directed at diplomats and politicians; while Roby C. Barrett's lengthy monograph on The Greater Middle East and the Cold War covers hundreds of pages in spelling out the lessons that President Kennedy should have learned from President Eisenhower after the latter had been forced to unlearn in his second term the presumptions he had brought to the region in his first. To summarize: while the six works under review do not explicitly subscribe to the periodization sketched at the start of this section, their own chronological frameworks are compatible with it. There is no debate on the impact of 9/11; and the authors offer us implicitly a timeline of the twentieth century which measures out (1) the interwar years and the Second World War; (2) the Cold War; and (3) the post-Cold War period. The geopolitical implications of this pattern will be discussed after the examination of the individual texts. The human factor, part I The work of David Reynolds will be known to many readers of International Affairs. A prolific and authoritative writer on twentieth-century British and US history, especially Anglo-American relations, Reynolds here examines a number of summits from the Hitler-Chamberlain meetings of 1938 ('Munich') to the four encounters of Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, first in Geneva, then in Reykjavik 10 Churchill was, of course, a Cabinet colleague of Neville Chamberlain's older half-brother, Austen, on a number of occasions. 11 J.

The book ends with a chapter on 'summitry as a way of life'. Though the detail is interesting and the judgements are sensible, this title is a misnomer, given that the chapter covers the G7, the Organization of African Unity, the Council of the EU and other examples of 'institutionalized summitry' (p. 381) far removed from the bilateral nature of Munich. Summits is elegantly written, witty and informative: the product of a happy teaching and research environment, helpful colleagues and collaborators, deep knowledge of the immediate subjects and wider context, and much primary and archival research (pp. 405?407). Indeed, it is just such scholarship, related in the bibliographical references, that suggests that Reynolds was unlikely to produce a work of surprising novelty to specialists. But Summits provides much of practical value, as Reynolds draws conclusions and lessons from the meetings he has studied (pp. 37off., esp. pp. 393-403). There were no American participants at Munich, of course. But (to pick up an earlier comment) the absence of the United States from Reynolds's second chapter is significant: for a major charge in the retrospective indictment of the so-called American 'isolationists' was that they contributed to the outbreak of war in September 1939. Part of the reason why Chamberlain and his supporters did not want war was that they hoped that Germany (Nazi if need be) would form a barrier against the USSR. After a few bloody and horrific years, with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom each standing virtually on its own and close to defeat by the senior partner in the Axis, Churchill engaged in summitry with Joseph Stalin in Moscow (August 1942), having got into practice with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Placentia Bay a year earlier to draft the Atlantic Charter.1^' Then followed Arcadia, Symbol, Trident, Quadrant and Octagon at the Anglo-American bilateral level until the Big Three leaders came together for the second time at Yalta in February 1945. (They had met in Tehran?Eureka?in late 1943, shortly after the three foreign ministers had met in Moscow.)13 Reynolds would be hard pressed to say anything fresh about Argonaut?the allusive code-name for the Crimean summit?but his conclusion is apt: echoing Stalin, he shows that the 'correlation of forces' allowed Stalin to get what he wanted and that later, mainly Republican, criticism of FDR made sense?if at all?only on the assumption that the United States would resist the Soviet terms by force (p. 148). Where a newish entrant to the Yalta historiographical debate may need help is in visualizing mentally the wartime dynamics that led to Argonaut and seeing cartographically what Stalin was after: politically secure neighbouring states (particularly Poland, Romania and Bulgaria); the integration of the Baltic republics into the Soviet system; and a common Soviet border with Czechoslovakia and Hungary: in short, the re-establishment of the essentially tsarist boundaries of pre-revolutionary Russia.14 12 In anticipation of one anatomical/typographical gaffe (see n. 34 below), I have seen this huge stretch of water near St John's, Newfoundland, referred to as 'Placenta Bay'! 13 These meetings are understandably not discussed by Reynolds. 14 I would have happily swapped some 40 cartoons, diagrams and photographs (a reminder of the TV origins of the book?) for decent maps. Argonaut followed up the decisions of Eureka so that it was obvious that Germany would be split to act as a buffer west of Poland. Specialists will know that Finland and the Norwegian border also need discussion.

Eisenhower and Nikita S. Khrushchev, met one-to-one at Camp David close to Washington.15 Reynolds mentions this visit and the plan to reciprocate with Eisenhower travel ling to Moscow after yet another four-power meeting in Paris to discuss?once again?the position of West Berlin within the People's Republic of (East) Germany. But the Eisenhower?Khrushchev summit was aborted after the shooting down of the American U2 spy plane over Soviet territory. It was against this background of suspicion, of an arms race (or 'missile gap') which the Americans were alleg edly losing, of increased tension surrounding Berlin, and of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba that the new president, John F. Kennedy, decided to undertake a journey to Vienna to meet Khrushchev in June 1961. While some historians have placed too much weight on the personalities both clashing and agreeing at Yalta, Reynolds gives the necessary human dimension to the Vienna summit without omitting the opposing interests of the major actors. A sympathetic and informed portrait is given of both men (notably their variant machismo); but Reynolds concentrates on their political disagreements?or rather, the disparity in their agendas. Khrushchev and the Soviet side wanted to concen trate on Europe, especially the 'German question', and arms control. Kennedy, meanwhile, appears to have had a more personal priority: to show that he would not be faced down, whether over Cuba, Berlin or Indo-China. Neither got what he wanted substantively, though each seems to have recognized the psychological resilience of the other (an invaluable mutual understanding during the Cuban 'missile crisis' the next year). Underpinning that insight was the more diplomatic lesson of not blustering, and negotiating from strength rather than weakness. In his inaugural address five months earlier Kennedy had declared (alluding to Munich): 'Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.' A neat chiasmus, but more instructive than the more famous rhetoric of that stirring speech.1 Two other chapters in this work deal with US?Soviet relations through the prism of summits: the Moscow meeting in 1972 between Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev (ch. 5) and that between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985 (ch. 7), this latter the precursor to three further summits between the American and Soviet leaders during the years 1986?8. As elsewhere in the book, Reynolds discusses other intervening bilateral and multilateral meetings that would appear in a comprehensive checklist of diplomatic encounters during the twentieth century. Readers familiar with the bigger picture of the 1970s and 1980s will admire Reynolds's skill in selecting the detail of history to emphasize House) less than a decade after the events remains unsurpassed: see W. H. McNeill, America, Britain, and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, ^41-46. Survey of International Affairs, ig3g?ig46 (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1953). Terminal, the conference in Potsdam in July-August 1945, appropriately concluded the wartime summits. 15 Khrushchev was formally First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers ('Prime Minister'). 1 See the reference to Warren Bass's work at n. 39 below. 1250 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s). Journal Compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/The Royal Institute of International Affairs</page><page sequence="7">US foreign and domestic politics since the Second World War the basic thrust of his argument: for example, the triangular American?Chinese Soviet relationship is well handled and integrated into the larger narrative. At the personal level we see the deviousness of Nixon and his alter ego, the self-styled 'realist' Henry Kissinger (pp. 259?60); the use of summitry to obscure domestic setbacks, both in Washington and in Moscow; the complaints from the princi pals about bureaucracy?despite the fact that, as Reynolds points out on many occasions, it is the scorned and usually anonymous bureaucrats who are needed to prevent or later rectify mistakes made by the public figures. But we may pause to consider just one point on which a reader may challenge the American actors, who seem to elicit the sympathy of Reynolds: the process known as 'peaceful coexis tence' or 'detente'. There were contemporary protests that the Soviet endorsement of detente (the 'relaxation of tensions in international relations', in the Russian formula) between the United States and USSR did not stop Moscow from pushing for political and military advantages in the Third World or Non-Aligned states (pp. 260?61: we will pick up this terminology later). Nor, we may add, did it stop the United States acting comparably?the difference being that most English language commentators implicitly shared the American Cold War mindset which saw the boundaries established at the end of the Second World War as marking the maximum permissible extent of Soviet territorial power and communist ideological influence. (The People's Republic of China was viewed similarly.) Everything else was the Free World in which the United States might legitimately act for the national and international good. This form of globalization has been one constant in the history of the United States, predating and outlasting the Cold War. As we shall see in considering the other works under review, the belief is so deep-seated that it permeates much American commentary and forms, it may be said, one of the dividing lines between Old Europe and America.17 Reynolds's penultimate chapter, on the Reagan?Gorbachev relationship, is the most interesting in the book?and one of the most provocative sections of any of the works under review.* While we may expect Reynolds to reflect on the positive and negative aspects of face-to-face diplomacy (and cite Nixon and the sometimes under rated George Shultz to his side, pp. 207, 336, 367?8), he also confronts the questions that lingered in the mind of contemporaries and later observers: Who was Reagan? Was he as naive as he looked, or simply disingenuous? Or was he like a Jamesian American hero (a comparison eschewed by Reynolds), who caused damage despite the best of intentions and produced good despite the worst of intentions? Did his combination of threats and espousal of a nuclear-free world frighten or convert the Soviets? Reynolds opts to describe Reagan as 'almost schizoid' (p. 325). For some readers this may seem an easy way out; but the description does suggest a way to handle the more frequent anthropomorphism of journalism and historiography. A 17 For some perspectives on the transatlantic divide, see Paul Hollander, Anti-Americanism: critiques at home and abroad, ig65~iggo (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), esp. ch. 8; Axel Poniatowski, Pour quoi les Frangais et les Americains ne se comprennentplus (Paris: Perrin, 2004); Russell A.

Berman concentrates upon German opinion. 1 The 1978 Camp David summit on the Middle East (ch. 6 in Reynolds) is discussed below. 1251 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

At any one time the 'correlation of [disparate and multifarious] forces' in a state, in a society, produces the ad hoc, contingent 'resultant', in the term of Georgi Plekhanov (the so-called father of Russian Marxism), the change we can recognize. Is the state, therefore, any less schizoid? In the bilateral relation ship developed between Reagan and Gorbachev the latter surely deserves more of the credit for advancing what he called the 'human factor': that the choice must be for peace rather than war. While we remember Gorbachev as the promoter of glasnost and perestroika, he had begun his leadership of the CPSU with the slogan of 'new (political) thinking', novoe (politicheskoe) myshlenie, arguably a more creative approach.19 But, judged by his own terms, Reagan had been right. He began his presidency rhetorically determined to thwart and ultimately bring down the Soviet Union, the 'evil empire'; he delivered his farewell address to the American people on the eve of that Soviet collapse. But in not using violence to resist social and political change Gorbachev merits the praise of Reynolds (p. 369). In this sense, a chapter short, we reach the conclusion of a work which, while foregrounding the role of individuals, tells us much and challenges our ideas on the shape of twentieth century history, particularly from the American perspective.20 The human factor, part II John Bolton is likely to be even better known than David Reynolds to readers of International Affairs: not for writing many historical books, but for his brief and controversial service as US Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 2005?2006, having previously acted as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. Bolton also served in the administrations of Reagan and G. H. W. Bush (the Elder: Bush 41 in the lingo). He is thus very much a Washington insider, though he would assuredly reject this term as evoking the bureaucrats he so obviously despises. Whatever personal and political presumptions a reader brings to this book, Bolton's many pages disappoint. The 'man with the mustache' (as he reminds us, p. 57) has rejoiced in his reputation for combativeness; but what comes across in the hundreds of pages is?perhaps not surprisingly?an egotist, with a very high yet fragile sense of self-worth. Why else the pretentious epigraphs to most chapters? Why does only one of twenty plates show anything other than John Bolton with various supporting casts? Yet the essential subject matter of this memoir is hugely important; and the processes that surround the substance are also important, complex and deserving of elucidation and explanation. Instead we have far too much detail, invariably in 19 Richard Sakwa, Gorbachev and his reforms, ig8$?iggo (London: Philip Allan, 1990), esp. chs 3, 7 and 9; Steven Kull, Burying Lenin: the revolution in Soviet ideology and foreign policy (Boulder, CO: Westview, 1992), esp. ch. 8.

Nikitin, Amerikanskaya model' na vesakh istorii [The American model on the scales of history] (Moscow: Progress, 1985), a publication of the Institute of US and Canada Studies, ISKAN, shows early signs of the 'new political thinking'. 20 Reynolds likes puns but he perhaps demands too much of his readers in quoting (Summits, p. 366) Raisa Gorbachev in transliteration and not drawing attention to the play on words in the Russian original: see Igor Korchilov, Translating history: the summits that ended the Cold War, as witnessed by Gorbachev's interpreter (London: Aurum, 1997), p. 183. 1252 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

Are all these words in quotation marks genuine oratio recta? Or are they Thucydides-style constructions of what might or should have been said by the interlocutors on great and small occasions? If this question is dismissed as a cheap and rather unliterary comment, we may ask why all this precision in the record is given instead of, for example, the text of Security Council resolutions, some three dozen of which are mentioned and enumerated rather than analysed. The lengthy and intricate business of reaching such a resolution is described?often. But fewer examples of this process (which allow Bolton to display his negotiating methods) and more citations of the 'black letter' international law which such resolutions constitute would serve the enquiring reader and novice to the UN far better.21 'Fear and loathing in New York' is the chapter heading describing Bolton's arrival at the UN in August 2005 under a presidential recess appointment: a compliment to the hostility Bush 43 's nomination of Bolton had generated in the US Senate and its powerful Committee on Foreign Relations. Aptly, the echo of Hunter S. Thompson's Las Vegas sums up both the fear Bolton constantly expresses about the damage the UN can do to the United States and his loathing for its permanent staff and most of the delegates (pp. 194?219). So Bolton would have chosen better if he had compared himself not to Sisyphus of the Rock or Hercules of the Augean Stables (p. 221) but to Hercules battling the Hydra. For the UN provides further, ever more numerous monsters to fight: the international incarnations of those Bolton continues to fight at home, in Washington especially. These are the bureau crats, particularly at the Department of State, with their 'clientitis' and consequent neglect of American interests; the 'High Minded' so-called internationalists, who worship at the 'altar' of the UN and venerate its 'Pope', former Secretary General Kofi Annan. But the 'feckless' and 'corrupt' UN is just the Turtle Bay home of the 'flaccid' Europeans, the 'Euroids', who have lost the will to fight metaphorically and literally for their national interests. Individuals are named; the indictment proceeds; and here in New York and down in Washington the enemies and the fifth column?the 'rich liberals and left-wing intellectuals', the 'chattering classes' more generally?seem to have the upper hand. Presidents Carter and Clinton are censured, as we might expect; but so too are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the latter becoming increasingly separated from her Republican party base. There are the true friends, above all Israel and Israel's supporters in Washington (pp. 317, 371-412, 416?22, 439?40); and joining them are the Pacific allies: South Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (to give us the jokey acronym, JUSCANZ, plus Seoul). This latter alignment against the Euroids may remind us of the interwar years, when both at the Paris Peace Conference and especially during the immigration and naval armaments debates of the 1920s and 1930s the 'White Dominions' were often found agreeing with Washington rather than London.22 Then the enemy had been Japan; now the disparate threats appear to come from 21 Bolton's treatment of the notorious UNSC Resolution 1441 of Nov. 2002 concerning Iraq is typical of his general approach. An overview of the Paris Peace Conference and its results is given by Margaret MacMillan in Peacemakers: the Paris conference ofigig and its attempt to end war (London: John Murray, 2001). 1253 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

And make no mistake: the Euroids include the UK, not just the Old Europe that had been on the wrong side in the run-up to the present war in Iraq. North Korea and its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) form one of the four case-studies of politics and (in)action at the UN: the others are Iran and halting its nuclear programme; Darfur and the contemptible response to genocide (pp. 343~9); and finally, Israel and Lebanon and the threats to both and the United States posed by Syria, Iran and the various 'terrorist' organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas which purport to defend the interests of the Palestinians (ch. 14; cf. pp. 207-209). In none of these cases does Bolton hint that the miscreants may have a case, however shaky. Perhaps this overt lack of understanding may work in diplo macy (though Bolton's poor record suggests its limitations: ch. 11); but surely in the considered memoirs of a practitioner the reader should be shown that there are two sides to every question, even if one side is distinctly shorter and weaker than the other? Conversely, on the workings of the Security Council; on the election of the present Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon; on the widespread agreement on the need to reform the Council (by enlargement and changing the composition of the permanent membership); on the issue of assessed vs voluntary contributions, especially for peacekeeping operations?on all these major topics Bolton has much to say of value, despite his jaundiced views. He is certainly right to doubt the likeli hood of any change in the permanent membership: turkeys and Christmas come to mind. Specifically, Bolton wants to see the UK lose its permanent seat: so much for the 'special relationship', at least in Anglo-American terms.23 (Israel fills that unique role for Bolton.) Nor does Bolton forget the many ad hoc arrangements that have both facilitated and circumvented aspects of the UN Charter (pp. 441?7). The earliest and still one of the most dramatic occasions (not mentioned by Bolton) was the 'Uniting for Peace' General Assembly Resolution 377 (V) of November 1950, which sanctioned the UN (US-led) war in Korea. Since then the United States has invoked and ignored the Charter on numerous occasions; and Bolton is to be congratulated on providing an analysis, if not a convincing defence, of this mixture of American multilateralism and unilateralism, which constitutes the procedural core of US foreign policy since the Second World War.24 For Bolton the key issue is the 'sovereignty' or 'independence' of the United States, untrammelled by such multilateral commitments as membership of the International Criminal Court and adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty?constraints from which (partly thanks to Bolton himself) the American 'Gulliver' has been 'cut loose' (ch. 3). But what about those treaties still in force and apparently binding on the United States?

Again, this approach is not new. During the 1950s, when the first Eisenhower administration was confronted with the Bricker amendment, Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles made clear to the Senate that the executive would prevent any UN interference in the 'domestic' sphere, notably by resisting foreign pressure for civil rights.25 Earlier still, US adherence to the UN Charter and the Statute of the International Court of Justice had proscribed similar interference.2 In the post-Cold War years this sort of international standard-setting is described as 'norming': prescribing standards or norms in intergovernmental agreements or even through NGOs to affect the domestic behaviour of states. Bolton will have none of these leftist... European values'; and, now citing the federal constitution and the Second Amendment, he describes his efforts inside and outside the UN to 'foil ... international gun control' (pp. 87?92). As a person who may relish the sobriquet of American diplomatic attack dog, Bolton gives his readers much to chew on. His own concluding image is of returning to the 'firing line'; and in a final chapter he offers a list of strategic goals and tactical methods for future administrations, Republican or Democrat. This proud AuH O-ite (p. 2) spells out the 'next generation of threats' to the United States; he calls for a 'cultural revolution' at the State Department, where the 'EAPeasers' have been particularly egregious in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs dealing with North Korea (esp. ch. 4); and, in an unacknowledged nod to interwar American critics of the League of Nations, he argues that 'there is no such thing as the United Nations'.27 Bolton's agenda is best addressed in the final paragraphs of this essay. In the meantime we turn to a rather different study of the past and the lessons which it provides: Roby C. Barrett's account of US policy in the Eisenhower and Kennedy presidencies. Geography is about maps and history is about... maps Roby C. Barrett is likely to be less well known to readers of International Affairs than either Reynolds or Bolton. He lists none of his works in the sources and bibliography; none in over 120 pages of closely printed notes; and the acknow ledgements and short historiographical preface (plus publisher's puff) suggest that this lengthy book is something of a new venture. Where does a reviewer begin? At the beginning, if we follow Dylan (the poet). But this is easier said than done. The preface has raised expectations about a study which will look at the region implied by Eisenhower's 'Middle East' doctrine of January 1957, given statutory form that 25 The standard work remains Duane Tananbaum, The Bricker amendment controversy: a test of Eisenhower's political leadership (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).

Wisely Barrett does not attempt to deal equally with this vast area; but there are suggestions and comments throughout the work that events in one part affected another. One obvious example is Algeria, where official French disquiet about Egyptian involvement in the insurrection encouraged Paris to participate in the disastrous Suez war in late 1956.30 (The first work mentioned by Barrett is Keith Kyle's Suez.)31 Instead, Barrett's Greater Middle East shrinks to mean (going roughly eastwards) Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iran, Pakistan and India, with Afghanistan in a minor role. It is these states whose interconnected politics Barrett undertakes to examine within a Cold War context. To echo John Bolton: a Herculean task! Such is the physical terrain. What of maps and a compass to guide the author and reader through this (still rather generally) unknown region, where religion, contemporary political ideologies and languages at least are different from those of the majority of the presumed readership? 32 Despite the promises made in the repetitive opening pages, Barrett follows a rather narrowly American approach. While Arabic sources are often cited, they seem to offer no real alternative to what became the standard view of American politics in this area: resisting or 'containing' the Soviet Union as it exploited naive nationalism. There is no discussion, system atic or even cursory, of Arab (pan-)nationalism: a striking negative example is the dismissal of the thinking of Gamal Abdel Nasser, surely the largest Arab figure on this landscape for some 25 years.33 The various manifestations of the Ba'athist (Arab Socialist Renaissance) movement are simply given a location within the mainly 28 Barrett's discussion could not be shorter (p. 38). With the Democrats holding a tiny majority in the Senate and a decent majority in the House, the vote showed much more opposition from the House to the resolution and distinct Democratic unease in the Senate: a congressional pattern repeated (see below). While not the equal to (but more contemporaneous than) the Chatham House Survey of International Affairs, the annual volumes published by the New York Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The United States in world affairs, provided excellent surveys of American international politics: see e.g. USWA 1957, esp. ch. 2. 29 A geopolitics extended eastwards to Indonesia and the 'Western Pacific' in 1958 by John Foster Dulles: Barrett, Greater Middle East, pp. 70-74. 30 Irwin M.

A new edition, subtitled Britain's end of empire in the Middle East, has been published (London: Tauris, 2003). 32 A fine contemporary introduction, whose biases are obvious, published under the auspices of the CFR is John C. Campbell, Defense of the Middle East: problems of American diplomacy (New York: Harper, 1958). For today's reader no better introduction to the area from an American perspective can be given than that published by the Congressional Quarterly staff, The Middle East, nth edn (Washington DC: CQ Press, 2007). The private commercial company Congressional Quarterly Inc., however authoritative its materials, is not to be confused, of course, with the official Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. 33 Transliteration of Arabic script (including Persian: see the lengthy note on gharbzadegi, pp. 426-7, connoting pathological westernization) can be a tricky subject.

So too with Jawaharlal Nehru of India, along with those states which became known as the Third World: the treatment of their alternative ideas does not give the reader a clear sense of how Barrett's Greater Middle East will be positioned in its challenge to the American definition of the Cold War. (Without the wit and clarity of Reynolds, Barrett does give the reader one laugh?inadvertently: the Indian diplomat usually known as Krishna Menon becomes the 'Ambassador of St. Pancreas'!)34 Since a major theme of Barrett's book is the unsuccessful attempt of the United States to enlighten the Non-Aligned Movement to the selfish and anti-nationalist aims of communists generally and the USSR in particular, the omission of any serious discussion of other world-views increases the likelihood that Barrett, while critical of American policy in rather general terms, will end up largely repeating a familiar narrative.35 The metaphorical map that Barrett uses is temporal, and the book traces essentially three stages. The first two cover the eight-year Eisenhower admin istration and show a shift from the American promotion of economic devel opment as the midwife of democracy through 'modernization' to a belief that authoritarian regimes were a better defence of American interests than liberal, pluralist and democratic societies; the third stage is subdivided into two, with the New Frontiersmen of John F. Kennedy's administration eventually accepting Eisenhower's more 'realist' approach that the internal and external threats against Jordan, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan in particular were best countered by supporting the local military?royal?authoritarian complexes. This timeline is then plotted with a more thematic, local dynamic: first comes the particular impact of Suez, and then the 1958 coup in Iraq, which saw the ousting of the pro-British King Faisal II and the collapse of the American-supported but British-led Baghdad Pact comprising Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan. (A subplot in Barrett is the decline of British power in the region and unsuccessful British efforts to influence American policy.)36 The advent of Major-General Abdul Karim Kassem (Abd-al Karim al-Qasim in the text), who restored Iraqi diplomatic relations with the USSR, then set the new frame for the Eisenhower Mark II and Kennedy Mark II administrations: Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in Iran and General, later Field Marshal, Muhammad Ayub Khan in Pakistan had to be supported against internal and external enemies, this being India in the latter case rather than the Soviet Union. Set out in this attenuated form, Barrett's thesis seems unexceptional. Certainly no scholar is going to be surprised to read that Washington (in the familiar short 34 A slip for St Pancras, the area in London where Krishna Menon (barrister rather than doctor) lived and worked: see e.g. T. J. S. George, Krishna Menon: a biography (London: Jonathan Cape, 1964), ch. 11. Menon's analyses of such issues as non-alignment, the Suez war, 'Israel [and] the Arabs', and the American 'God-given right to police the world' are set out at length in Michael Brecher, India and world politics: Krishna Menon's views of the world (London: Oxford University Press, 1964), esp. p. 301. 35 As Campbell phrased the issue, the task was the 'containment of Soviet imperialism in the Middle East': Defense of the Middle East, p. 5.

The Greater Middle East simply provides various pages from the historical gazetteer of American client states that played the Soviet card, sometimes so cynically that surely no one in Washington could believe the hypocrisy (see especially ch. 8). Perhaps more surprising is Barrett's contribution to the extensive historiography re-evaluating Eisenhower: in the newish consensus Ike is the person calling the shots, not Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his successor Christian Herter.37 By contrast, it is Kennedy who rightly learns from the mistakes of his predecessor. But what hard work it is to cross the terrain that Barrett opens before his readers! Substantive endnotes, cumulatively a third of the length of the main text; lengthy and introspective squabbles with other scholars, rather than proper integration of any important debates in the body of the argument; numerous typographical errors; repetitious information; odd phrasing (Whitehall and the FCO)?and more general solecisms; leading politicians mis-spelled or wrongly identified (Attlee was the British prime minister; Senator Stuart Symington represented Missouri); disputes mentioned but not explained (the al-Buraymi controversy, the Shatt al-Arab, Helman river, the McMahon Line), a completely inadequate index . . .3 Of course, a historian must make a judgement about the knowledge and competence of the reader; but Barrett has been let down both by his editors and by his own failure to gauge what needs to be said and where. Conversely, a reviewer must guard against asking questions of a writer that are not germane to the text. We may, however, legitimately take three questions that do emerge from the many pages before us. First and most obvious: what is the exact nature of Barrett's complaints about Eisenhower and Kennedy, Marks I and II? After hundreds of pages Barrett appears to be saying that there was no alternative to the repressive policies pursued by Washington in the Greater Middle East. If so, then there is not much to be learned from the history he has set before us, though we may admire the industry that has produced this particular piece of historiography. Second, and related: what was the nature of the intellectual input within the decision-making in Washington? Barrett provides much raw evidence of the bureaucratic infighting in Washington and (somewhat less) of the disagree ments between Washington and staff in the field. All too often the conflicts seem to be resolved, if at all, through strength of personality rather than argument and discussion. Third, and also related: what was the role of non-executive policy makers, notably Congress and domestic interest groups? Barrett frequently refers to 'Jewish and pro-Zionist votes', the 'pro-Israeli lobby' (pp. 138, 351, ch. 9 and notes passim) and similar coalitions; he much more rarely discusses the part played 37 An aside on political correctness and reviewers: am I alone in thinking that two references to the Holy Grail might be inappropriate, one in a caption to a photograph of the Shah publicizing land reform (p. 238; see also pp. 37, 142)? For a representative anthology of 'post-revisionist' Eisenhower literature, with a foreword by one of Barrett's sources, see Gunter Bischof and Stephen E. Ambrose, eds, Eisenhower: a centenary assessment (Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1995), esp. pp. 1?15. 3 The Russian-language writer mentioned in the bibliography should be Gafurov, a leading Tajik oriental scholar and CP office-holder in his Soviet republic; and Barrett uses the term the United Arab Republic (of Egypt and Syria) as a synonym for Egypt after the UAR's dissolution. 1258 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

(Congress does not appear in the index either.) As we have seen, John Bolton has much to say?and reveal?about bureaucratic infighting; he also has little to say about Congress. On this latter topic and, above all, on domestic lobbies, Mearsheimer and Walt have said much?and have been repaid in kind. The emperor's old clothes Readers of International Affairs who do not know the work of John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have simply not been paying attention! This particular story began some two and a half years ago, when the two American academics published a lengthy essay in the London Review of Books sketching out the nature and influ ence of the 'Israel lobby' on US foreign policy in the Middle East. As the LRB's letters column was to show for three months afterwards, most respondents, both non-Americans and Americans, attacked the essay as at best a caricature, at worst an anti-Semitic and unscholarly diatribe. In a preface and general introduction to the book under review the authors recall these events, describe something of the scale and ferocity of readers' reactions, and set out their framework for elaborating and substantiating their case. They also tell us the background to the publication in the London Review of Books: the stateside Atlantic Monthly would not touch the material as presented. For those who have indeed managed to miss this 'battle of the book' and essay, a precis of the two texts may help. But here I put the larger cart before the horse in abstracting the far lengthier book and then adding some notes about the initial LRB publication.40 The structure of The Israel lobby could not be clearer. After the opening pages setting out the genesis of their book, the authors detail the economic, military and diplomatic aid that the US government has given the state of Israel, not since its establishment and formal recognition in 1948 but rather since the Six Day War and the subsequent unanimous UNSC Resolution 242 of November 1967 calling for a 'just and lasting peace ... in the area' (mentioned but not fully analysed in the text: pp. 37, 44).4I Such unmatched levels of official support to an individual country would seem to be explicable only by recourse to overwhelming 'strategic' and/or 'moral' arguments, and the authors are not convinced that either of these categories applies. What, then, does explain the actions of the United States, 'the Great Benefactor'? Answer: the ubiquitous power of the 'Israel lobby' (ch. 4), whose composition and methods are then discussed (chs 5 and 6). There follows a brief and second introduction to case-studies of the 'lobby in action'. Five separate 39 An argument for the relative newness of the 'Israel lobby' (see below) is made in Warren Bass, Support any friend: Kennedy's Middle East and the making of the US?Israel alliance (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 146?8. 40 John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, 'The Israel lobby', London Review of Books 28: 6, 23 March 2008, pp. 3, 5-12; LRB 'Letters' section from 6 April to 22 June; the authors' rebuttal can be found in the 11 May issue. See also Martin Walker's review of The Israel Lobby, International Affairs 84:1, January 2008, pp. 149?51. 41 In response to the Yom Kippur (October) 1973 war the Security Council passed unanimously UNSC Resolu tion 338 reaffirming the substance of UNSC Resolution 242. 1259 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

There are, of course, overlaps between these subjects: the role of Syria and Iran in Lebanon and the 'Occupied Territories' (to echo UNSC Resolution 242); the 'dream [that] transforming' (pp. 22off.) these three (and more) countries in the Middle East might follow the overthrow of Saddam Hussein (assuming the transformation to be conducive to overt American interests); the political and ideological relation ships between these states and Israel and the Palestinians?the interplay and varia tions are many. A concluding chapter asks and answers the question: 'What is to be done?' So much for the hundreds of pages of straight prose and detailed references in the book, whose argumentation will be discussed shortly. But it was the LRB essay that produced the initial and very hostile reaction; and its structure and expres sion, while essentially no different from the far longer book version, surely gave ammunition to those who wanted to avoid rather than refute the two key points in the Mearsheimer and Walt thesis. In the space available in the LRB points were compressed or lacked nuance; and the 'brutal ... executions, massacres and rapes by Jews' of Arabs in two decades of fighting before the Six Day War was language perhaps shocking to the readership (LRB, p. 5; cf. Israel Lobby, pp. 98?103), though the authors seem content to describe Palestinian actions and movements which act as self-proclaimed Palestinian champions (Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad) as 'terrorist' tout court.42 The two major claims by the authors are (1) that Israel has indeed been proportionately the major beneficiary of US economic, military and diplomatic support for some 40 years; and (2) that Israel's success in this regard has to be attributed in large measure to the success of advocates inside the United States. Diplomats sometimes say they envy academics for having time to reflect outside the day-to-day pressures of public office; sometimes they flatter academics by suggesting they have more influence than practitioners upon public opinion? at least on future opinion-formers. (These sorts of remarks are perhaps directed to non-American academics, since the revolving door connecting scholarship and public office is wider and turns more quickly in the United States than elsewhere.) Both the envy and the judgement may be justified. What cannot be doubted is that any academic who has been around since the Six Day War knows that Israel has been supported by the US government through the proverbial thick and thin of war and uncertain peace in the Middle East since the passage of the Eisenhower 42 On 'terrorism' and US foreign policy, see Michael Dunne, 'The United States, the United Nations and Iraq: "multilateralism of a kind"', International Affairs 79: 2, March 2003, pp. 257?77 at pp. 274-5. A Palestinian perspective on pro-Israel lobbying is Donald Neff, Fallen pillars: US policy towards Palestine and Israel since ig4$ (Washington DC: Institute for Palestine Studies, 1995). Often seen as a champion of the Palestinians, Noam Chomsky appeared unimpressed by the Mearsheimer?Walt analysis: see Chomsky quoted in the Observer, 2 April 2006. For his own analysis, see Noam Chomsky, The fateful triangle: the United States, Israel and the Palestin ians (Boston: South End Press, 1983), esp. ch. 2. 1260 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

Furthermore, and in a tradition equally as long as the canonical nature of American diplomatic practice, this support for Israel has been rooted in domestic politics, especially in the mix that includes ethnicity, ideology and congressional and presidential elections. As the authors say, such lobbying within the political system is as American as apple pie; and should the distinct if sometimes surprising groups which constitute the 'Israel lobby' doubt for a moment that they were not influencing official policy, they would redouble their efforts or admit defeat?though probably claiming, in the latter event, that the contest had been stacked unfairly against them. Where Mearsheimer and Walt made their mistake in the essay was in trying to say in relatively few words apropos Israeli actions towards the Palestinians that the support was not merited and was counterproductive to broader American interests in the region, indeed posed threats to the United States.44 Critics picked up on points of detail and found grounds for detecting anti-Semitism in the article; but in the eyes of this reviewer none came to grips with the essence of the piece, which was then elaborated exten sively in the book. Since no one has challenged the contention that Washington and successive Israeli governments have been virtual diplomatic twins over four decades, let us look at the composition of the Israel lobby and how and where it operates in Washington. The Israel lobby as depicted by Mearsheimer and Walt comprises three main heterogeneous groups, the individual elements of which converge in their common support of Israel, understood in this context as the actions and policies of succes sive Israeli governments. The largest of the trio is made up of those many organi zations representing various strands of American Jewry: the most famous in this subset is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), along with other well-established groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the Zionist Organiza tion of America.45 Second in size of membership, though not as effective as the first and third groups, are the ranks of the Christian evangelicals (whose vision of Israel in the Second Coming is literally apocalyptic and might well disturb Jewish as well as Muslim inhabitants of 'Greater Israel').46 The third group is the 43 Michael Dunne, 'Hemisphere and globe: the terms of American foreign relations', International Affairs 70: 4, Oct. 1994, pp. 701-20, esp. pp. 717-20. 44 Cf.

(Clearly there will be some overlap in personnel between the three groupings.) Their three-voiced message is that Israel must be defended against its enemies, who are ipso facto America's enemies. The nub of the authors' case is that Israel has created its own enemies, first in its various wars against the indigenous and neighbouring Arabs and, second, far more self-defeatingly, in its continuing to hold on to and settle the Occupied Territories and the consequent treatment of the Palestinians, both those who remained after 1967 and those who became refugees then and in the preceding 20 years.4 This may be called the analytical core of the book. What follows for American policy is that the United States should distance itself from official Israeli action (particularly on continuing settlement within the West Bank, the final boundaries and the eventual limits and role of Jerusalem in a possible two-state solution to the conflict, and the possession of the Golan Heights), since the current identification of Washington with the Israeli government threatens broader American objectives in the Middle East.49 Such is the essential composition of the Israel lobby and such, in the proverbial nutshell, is the authors' response to the policies they see the lobby pursuing. But how does the lobby effect or simply affect American policy? One preliminary point, very important substantially but also methodologically in any examination of lobbying: as other commentators have often noted, there is no comparable countervailing force to that of the Israel lobby. There are other actors and agencies at work, even other groups: among the former would be different bureaucratic analyses of the strategic considerations involved; among the latter would be competing pressure groups, representing for example the Arabs or Muslims in general or the Palestin ians in particular. But for Mearsheimer and Walt such forces exercise nothing like the combined influence of the Israel lobby.50 Phrased sometimes differently, this conclusion has been accepted by other scholars for some decades.51 How, then, does the Israel lobby achieve its aims? One method is well known, though the detail provided may surprise some readers. This is old-fashioned 47 Dunne, 'The "terms of the connection'", pp. 476?7. 48 Indigenous, that is, within the territory of Palestine mandated to the British empire by the League of Nations in 1922. 49 There are those who argue that the US?Israel relationship harms Israeli interests: see Abraham Ben-Zvi, The United States and Israel: the limits of the special relationship (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993). 50 Ali A.

Again, in a pattern well established since the 1960s, the lobby is more effective upon the Senate than the House and more effective with the Congress than the White House.52 This asymmetry emerges from the text: it is not argued explic itly. The inference to draw is that other pressures (diplomatic, the arguments from federal departments and agencies, even 'oil') can be applied to policy-framers (in the Department of State, at the National Security Council), who are responding to more than just the demands made upon Capitol Hill.53 Yet the detail of the pressure which the lobby puts on Congress may surprise and even disturb readers, not to mention citizens. Elected and aspirant office-holders seem to be evalu ated for campaign purposes mainly on their agreement with the lobby's criteria. Beyond the electoral process the lobby attempts to restrict debate, sometimes using the charge of anti-Semitism directed against gentiles, sometimes the charge of self hatred directed towards Jewish critics. (It is worth noting that Mearsheimer and Walt constantly insist that American?and Israeli?-Jews are not unanimous and that opposition to various successes of the lobby is to be found in both groups.) Getting to grips with these charges and counter-charges is impossible here; but it may lessen the heat to make the obvious point that the rebuttals have not settled the initial allegations and later responses. Historians and political scientists have been here before.54 Is there anything novel about Mearsheimer and Walt's work, except perhaps the detail given to the indictment of the Israel lobby?for such it is? (The 350 pages of argument generate 100 pages of closely printed references. Here, unlike Barrett but like Reynolds, the authors get the balance right.) Although the LRB article appeared before the 2006 Lebanon war, the Israeli conduct of that war, the declared casus belli, the loss of Lebanese life and the physical destruction to Lebanon itself may have caused some American observers to question their country's general complaisance towards the Israeli government. Perhaps this unease irritated a nerve already made raw by the war in Iraq, a war which the neo-cons and certain parts of the Jewish side of the lobby triangle had advocated before and after 9/11 and for which Congress's legislative endorsement during the Clinton administration of 'regime change' in Iraq had prepared the intellectual and moral ground. Moreover, this latest Iraq war, coming, of course, on top of the war in Afghanistan, was flagged as a contribution to Israeli safety. Now that these wars have so far failed to produce the beneficial 'transformation' envisaged for the Middle East, their propo nents are seeking to distance themselves from the consequences. What cannot be seriously questioned is the longevity and vigour of the Israel lobby. Historians sometimes take the story back to 1948 and the swift diplomatic 52 Robert H.

Feuerwerger, Congress and Israel: foreign aid decision-making in the House of Representatives, ig6g-ig76, Greenwood contributions in political science 28 (Westport, CT, and London: Greenwood, 1979). 53 Bolton and Barrett in their different ways give evidence of the bureaucratic struggles in Washington; both also write about various versions and manifestations of the Israel lobby. 54 Richard H.

More surprising was the American embrace of Israel so soon after its involvement in the Anglo-French attack on Egypt in 1956 generally known as 'Suez'.5 Presenting itself and being seen as the major American ally against the Soviet Union in the Middle East was Israel's 'great transformation', one decidedly more real than the 'dreams' of some members of today's Israel lobby. What is to be done? Famous words, of course; and the question is directly posed by Mearsheimer and Walt in respect of the lobby (pp. 335?55) and by Bolton in his insistent agenda for the new administration (pp. 429?56); and both Reynolds (pp. 393?403) and Barrett (esp. pp. 314?27) less abruptly and more tentatively offer suggestions for future official conduct. Where all five authors agree is in seeing the importance of the Middle East for the United States?and vice versa. For Mearsheimer and Walt the key to a better US policy lies in countering the pressure and the arguments of the Israel lobby. Bolton's emphasis is also on countering pressures, domestic as much as international?but in his case those pressures that squeeze and weaken the ability of the United States to act in its own 'sovereign' and 'independent' interest rather than in deference to the misguided and unpatriotic internationalism characteristic of the UN, where the United States should continue to defend Israel. Reynolds's programmatic conclusions can be derived from his discussion of the 1978 Camp David summit involving President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. In Carter's mind, a resolution of the conflict between Israel and Egypt might help towards general Middle East peace (ch. 6). Here, to quote directly from our final text, Reynolds draws 'lessons from the past' to guide political leaders in negotiating at the summit level.57 Reynolds has no doubt, despite what he generously calls the 'ambiguous legacy' (p. 316) of this particular Camp David summit, that there had been positive aspects of the process that could provide a (partial) model for future personal diplomacy. President Carter was fully engaged and well briefed; Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and the latter's assistant William Quandt formed an excellent team, knowledgeable and alive to wider 55 For the debate see John Snetsinger, Truman, thefewish vote and the creation of Israel (Stanford, CA: Hoover Insti tute Press, 1974), and Steven L.

Sadat wanted to remove Israeli forces from recognized Egyptian territory; Begin's policy was to detach Egypt from the ranks of hostile Arab neighbouring states but without compromising his and Likud's insistence upon retaining most of the Occupied Territories. (The Golan Heights remain a separate source of friction with Syria.) Ultimately these heterogeneous goals were achieved, making Egypt a pariah state among much of the Arab world. Carter is praised for having 'invested [more] energy, thought and political capital' than any other president in trying to achieve a Middle East settle ment (p. 316). That this desideratum has not yet been realized is not, Reynolds would argue, a failure of summitry per se but attributable rather to the conflict of interests between the two major antagonists. Thus one essential condition of any successful negotiation is knowing what is the 'bottom line' of all parties. The Middle East summit of 1978 was not the only one to be held at Camp David. In July 2000 President Bill Clinton hosted a second summit, this time involving Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat. Kurtzer and Lasensky place this trilateral summit within a helpful timeline (pp. 84?122) covering the period from the Six Day War to the multilateral conference of November 2007 in Annapolis, Maryland, and provide an anthology of diplo matic materials from the Madrid conference of 1991 up to the 2007 meeting.59 The Oslo Accords of 1993, the Clinton Parameters of December 2000, the Quartet's 'Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict' of 2003, the Annapolis 'Joint Understanding' between Israel and the Palestinian Authority: these and other important documents are published in an appendix of materials along with a series of maps. The language of the Joint Understanding (signed in November 2007 under the 'auspices' of Bush 43 and to be monitored by the US government) is uplifting, committing the parties to 'concluding] a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception .6o The self-imposed deadline to 'conclude an agreement' between the Israeli govern ment and the Palestinian Authority is the end of 2008: that is, after the election of the new US president but before he enters the White House. That would be some Middle East achievement to welcome in his inaugural address to the American people! We may confidently but sadly predict that there will be no such agree ment. But how much one academic hopes to be proved wrong. 58 Vance's and Brzezinski's accounts can be found in their memoirs: Zbigniew Brzezinski, Power and principle: memoirs of a national security advisor, ig7j?igSi, rev. edn (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1985), esp. ch. 7; Cyrus Vance, Hard choices: critical years in America's foreign policy (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1983), esp. chs 9?11 and appendix II; and see William B. Quandt's longer, authoritative account, Peace process: American diplomacy and the Arab?Israeli conflict since ig6j, 3rd edn (Washington DC: Brookings; Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005). 59 The joint US?Soviet invitation to Madrid was one of the last diplomatic acts of the USSR. 60 Emphasis added.

As for the agenda of the new administration, Robert Kagan offers a literate, brief but wide-ranging survey of the issues which 'policymakers, politicians, pundits and all who want a guide to the dangerous waters of 21 st-century geopolitics' should read. Not his words, not my words, but those of presidential candidate John McCain himself in dustjacket phrasing. There too we read Richard Holbrooke, one of John Bolton's predecessors as US ambassador to the UN (but as a Clintonite not favoured by Bolton), joining in the praise for a book which would and indeed should 'shape [the] next president's foreign policy'. Kagan, of course, figures among the neo-cons; and his advocacy during the 1990s of regime change in Iraq is traced by Mearsheimer and Walt. I But though his essay on 'the return of history and the end of dreams' describes three intellectual and political moments in the post-Cold War world, none is dated to 9/11 or the outbreak of the present Iraq war. The first of these partly sequential, partly contemporaneous stages is the appearance of the argument, associated above all with Francis Fukuyama, that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union specifically and socialism more generally registered the 'end' of History (with a capital H) and the passage of the world as a whole to a post-ideological condition.62 The second moment is the shift from this fanciful notion to the argument that previous political conflicts were being replaced by cultural conflicts, an analysis invariably associated with Samuel P. Huntington's 'clash of civilizations' thesis.63 The third and less precise moment is the rebirth of History in a new guise, one that combines the statecentric politics of the Westphalian system (so relished by Bolton) with the post-Westphalian 'liberal interventionism' (so deplored by Bolton), an inter mingling that has characterized the last two decades. It may be doubted whether such intellectual architecture will help in defining and solving particular problems which come to the Oval Office or Situation Room; but certain elements in Kagan's argumentation and larger world-view may help readers gain a better sense of the ideological and political components of American foreign policy. It is not paradoxical that conservatives are sympathetic to authoritarian states : Henry Kissinger, the 'geopolitical realist' (Kagan, p. 11), perhaps remains the best example in the United States. Kagan is in this tradition; and he begins his long essay with sketches of Russia and the People's Republic of China. Each wants American recognition of its Great Power status; both agree that the putative new world order succeeding the Cold War was a claim for American dominance; and, despite significant differences, both vast countries?along with India, Iran and Japan?are all driven in their foreign relations by a deep-seated nationalism. Kagan does not eschew anthropomorphism: he puts this unfashionable approach straight 61 For Kagan himself, see The Israel lobby, esp. pp. 238-50; for Kagan and the 'Project for a New American Century', see Dunne, 'The "terms of the connection'", pp. 476?7. 63 Francis Fukuyama, The end of history and the last man (New York: Free Press, 1992); reviewed in International Affairs 69: 2, April 1993, pp. 354-5. 63 Samuel P.

He writes: 'true realism about inter national affairs means understanding that a nation's foreign policy is heavily shaped by the nature of its government'; but he shows that 'government' means more than simply political structures and embraces culture, public life and society as a whole, each aspect influencing the others (p. 98; cf. pp. 80, 92?3). Area special ists will judge whether his analysis of Russian and other cultures is sustainable: certainly his portrayal of Iran, the (wider) 'Muslim world', including 'radical [and] fundamentalist' Islam, and Israel may well surprise readers who know Kagan only from the work of Mearsheimer and Walt (pp. 48?9). 4 But precisely because there is a symbiosis between foreign and domestic politics, there is a material difference between the external behaviour of democratic and authoritarian states?Kagan's key typology. Thus the historic fault-lines between Russia and (the rest of) Europe have reopened. The enlargement of the European Union into the old Soviet bloc already threatens to undermine a precarious post-Cold War stability; and adding Turkey to this 'voluntary empire' would be even more divisive, schismatic indeed (pp. 13?15, 19?23, 65). Why, then, is Turkey's half-century and more of NATO membership unproblematic? I suspect because Kagan shares the more general American view of NATO as a successful democratic bulwark against the former USSR. The programmatic elements in Kagan's text are set in general rather than specific terms; but it is clear that he does not want US foreign policy to be overdetermined by the democratic-authoritarian divide, with the United States always leading the 'Axis of Democracy' against the 'Association of Autocrats' (pp. 53?80, 97?102). The United States can and does work successfully with all types of government, though combining bilaterally or multilaterally on an ad hoc basis with fellow democrats, 'Enlightenment democrats' (p. 97), is the better, more secure option. In language reminiscent of Bolton, Kagan shows and welcomes the many different forms of international cooperation available to promote national goals, but insists that the United States must not be constrained by the limits of particular organiza tions. Act via NATO, act via the UN, act via the Gj?but above all, be prepared to act unilaterally, Kagan urges; and he reminds us of how often the United States has acted in just this fashion. Clearly the message is that the United States should not refrain from foreign interventions if they are deemed to be in American inter ests; equally he cautions against 'liberal interventionism', code for the disinterested employment of American resources to serve the purposes of others. This is allusive language which those returning to History can recognize. But, just to make the point more concretely, would the United States fight the PRC to preserve the regime in Taiwan? Would the United States, let alone the EU, fight to preserve the status quo in Georgia, in Ukraine? These, as some commentators say, are 'num' questions. (Dumb questions, Kagan might pun.) 4 Perhaps we should say lfirst portrayal', for a different image is offered at pp. 84-5, 95.1 assume the phrase 'Israeli cancer' used by Kagan (p. 49) is oratio obliqua.

Whoever steps forward, whether a great extempore orator or a less scintillating speaker, the terms of the speech can be predicted with some confi dence. It will offer a message of hope in difficult times; war abroad and economic troubles at home will provide Americans with yet another opportunity to prove their resilience and adaptability; the fundamental values of the United States remain secure; whatever the difficulties, the future will always be better than the present; the American people will rise to and then transcend these temporary challenges; one president passes into history, another takes his place ... and 'God [will] bless America'. This transition, the preceding campaigning and elections are part of the political process which many participants and foreign observers see as the essence of the American system. But historians are likely to hear a particular, double resonance in this latter term. The 1990s witnessed a flourish of historical writing and retrospective praise for Alexander Hamilton, part of a wider movement to promote an American foreign policy based upon the nationalism of Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt?and Ronald Reagan. Hamilton is not usually thought of as a great rhetorician; but in Federalist XI (printed immediately after James Madison's powerful and paradoxical arguments in Federalist X for territorial expansion across the continent) the chief of the propaganda collective called Publius coined one of the greatest sentences in the American political canon: 7 'Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!' We do not need to be neo-Hamiltonians to feel the force of these words. Nor do we need to cite only Hamilton for our purpose. A generation later in 1823 the ageing Thomas Jefferson (whose own first inaugural in 1801 summoned his 'Friends and Fellow-Citizens' to unite across the party-political divide) echoed the same sentiment and used the same phrasing to defend the Monroe Doctrine avant la lettre. Calling for abstention from European wars, and thereby contrib uting to the principle and practice of American unilateralism, Jefferson argued 65 Under legislation dating from the 1870s, which itself derives from provisions of the original federal constitu tion (article II, section i), the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November of a leap year is the date set for popular voting in the United States; but individual states have instituted earlier voting and some states permit postal (effectively early) ballots for all voters. 66 I developed this argument and the links to the neo-cons in a paper delivered to a symposium on 'The legacy of George Washington' at the Library of Congress in 1999, the essence of which was published as 'Farewell to the farewell address? or a "discourse of the permanent and transient in American polities'", Virginia Quarterly Review 77: 2, Spring 2001, pp. 211?29, esP- 224?5. 67 The third and most junior member of the trio who composed the 85 Federalist Papers was John Jay. 1268 International Affairs 84: 6, 2008 ? 2008 The Author(s).

This would be the American 'compass [by which they] would steer through the ocean of time'. As we know, the Monroe Doctrine did not stop the United States from seeking to extend the American system throughout the world; and with the characteristic aggregation which became the hallmark of American doctrinal foreign policy,69 the sanctity of that doctrine (with its premise of hemispheric separation) was preserved during the Cold War as the United States constructed formal alliances and staked geopolit ical claims to most of the land and sea areas?the Free World?outside the actual control of the USSR and the People's Republic of China: globalization itself? again, avant la lettre. The American system, as both Hamilton and Jefferson suggested, was not simply a foreign policy: rather (to pre-echo, in today's language, Robert Kagan) foreign policy was the external dimension of domestic policy. In this other sense the phrase 'American system' connotes the combination and harmonizing of sectional inter ests which was the political goal of Kentucky's most famous antebellum politi cian, Henry Clay. Clay's programme involved the promotion of manufacturing in the north-east, primary production of raw materials and foodstuffs in the slave holding South and expanding free-soil West, all united by improved communica tions, financially enriched by higher tariffs and bolstered by national banking: such was Clay's Great Compromise as slavery expanded until it finally split the Union. After the Civil War American energies (to speak in shorthand) concentrated upon developing these three geographical sections. But at the turn of the nineteenth century into the twentieth the big political question, in the so-called Great Debate, was whether this political economy could be maintained without carrying the American system overseas; and whether such a projection beyond the land-mass of North America would mean the adoption of European-style imperialism? and thus the end of republicanism. Though European-style colonialism was essen tially rejected, the idea that the United States had a right to extend its economic system, with its affiliated political system, to each and every part of the world was reinforced. This form of expansionism, this form of globalization, became the ideological norm of American domestic and foreign policy at the beginning of the twentieth century; and it still holds sway in the United States. This was the 'great mission', this the new 'manifest destiny', said Senator Henry Cabot Lodge during the Great Debate.70 The controversies over American membership of the League of Nations and the pursuit of what we call interwar isolationism were about the means and consequences of expansion, not about its desirability; the Cold War, usually presented in terms of a defensive posture by the United States, should more correctly be seen as another stage in the attempt to Americanize the Jefferson to Monroe, 24 Oct. 1823: see Ruhl J.
