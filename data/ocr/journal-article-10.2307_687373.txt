While neither the best nor the worst of the genre, it is a collection that offers a representative sample of traditional themes. As practicing scientists who view the implications of behavioural research from a somewhat different perspective we offer this critical review. i Intention and Introspection 2 Observation and Inference 3 Projective Introspection 4 Experimental Ethology 5 Experimental Primatology 6 Cognitive Ethology 7 Introspection and Folklore 8 Communication and Intelligence 9 Concluding Comment Scientific research into the intelligent behaviour of human and nonhuman animals has been accelerating for decades, and some of the most exciting discoveries can be found in laboratory and field studies that reveal the variety, the precision, the complexity, the subtlety, the versatility of social communication in nonhuman primates. Those hoping to learn about the substance of these new developments in a book entitled, The Meaning of Primate Signals, will be disappointed. In this volume (henceforth MOPS) edited by Rom HarrY, a philosopher, and Vernon Reynolds, an anthro- pologist, 'meaning' rarely, if ever, refers to the information that might be conveyed by primate signals. Their concern is not the meaning of what the primates say, but whether they mean to say it-whether nonhuman beings have intention. In the enterprise described in this book the authors are trying to provide a clear enough answer to the question of how similar (and how dissimilar) animal intentions are to those of humans ...

The attraction of philosophy is the promise of understanding. But, understanding is a subjective experience. What makes us say that we understand this or that idea? What makes us say that students understand- is it that they can repeat back what they have heard or read, that they can pass examinations, that they say they understand? By contrast, those who promise adventure, profit, power, must have something external and palpable to offer-mushroom-shaped clouds, moon rocks, chess-playing machines. Where philosophy can be lofty and noble, science must be crass and materialistic. I INTENTION AND INTROSPECTION The MOPS approach is militantly subjective. Where a scientific inquiry would begin with a description of tangible evidence for the existence of human intention, the editors and contributors to MOPS begin by assuming that human intention is so well-accepted that description is unnecessary. We feel relatively safe in assuming that humans intend to communicate certain information when they speak, and we generally assume that such intention is somehow unique to human language. (Seyfarth, p. 44) Introspection, our own experiences and detailed accounts by others of remembering, forgetting, making decisions, and so on, give us reasonably direct access to the kind of mental images that we may associate with intention, and what this evidence lacks in 'objectivity' seems more than made up for by vivid clarity of detail. (Quiatt, p. io) By these criteria the Old Testament could compete with the Origin of Species and Aesop's Fables with Tinbergen's Study of Instinct. Within the covers of MOPS, the only remaining attempt to describe a starting point for the inquiry can be found in the editorial introduction, Each of us has personal experience (and therefore knowledge) of the complex, cognitive thought processes that go on in his or her head. We know we think, and we know our thoughts to be long, convoluted and interminable. We also know that these thoughts underlie our actions. They do not perhaps entirely determine our actions but they do guide them. . . We have a unique entree into the human mind: our personal subjective experience. From this starting point which we must accept as a valid source of data (for if our own experience is not valid then what is?), we can attempt to generalize outward into the minds of others. If we could not do this, we could not explain the actions of other people. What they do makes sense only in terms of how it compares with what we would do in a comparable situation. That is the basis of common-sense, or 'folk' psychology. (p. i) This is a clear departure from the ordinary rules of scientific evidence. First, there is the claim that reports of subjective experience are as valid as any other source of data. This is based on the canard that, since all scientific observations must ultimately be experienced by human beings-even instrument dials and computer printouts must be read by human eyes-</page><page sequence="3">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 479 then all human experience is scientific observation. The other side of this coin is the claim that unbiased observation is a myth because all human observation is necessarily distorted by the biased expectations of prejudiced observers. Between the two there is much comfort for those who would avoid the fatigue of rigorous investigation. There is also no way to account for scientific progress except as a series of brilliant insights achieved by inspired genius (although there is a school in which scientific progress is itself a myth of biased observation). Practicing scientists learn, however, that what they are practicing is one of those arts of the possible in which there are many degrees of rigour. Fortunately, there is a difference between disciplined, publicly verifiable, observation and ordinary subjective ex- perience, and several hundred years of modern science have demonstrated that the difference is well worth the effort. 2 OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE The second departure from scientific rules of evidence is the MOPS confusion between observation and inference. The problem of separating observation from inference enters a scientific investigation at several levels. A reading of 25 on one instrument and I4:oz on another are possible observations, but the statement that a certain chamber reached a tempera- ture of 25 degrees Centigrade at 14:oz2 hours is an inference. Practicing scientists devote a great deal of space and effort in their research reports to the descriptive apparatus that separates observations from low-level in- ferences of this kind. The procedure is known as operational definition and it often makes original sources into tedious reading. Without this technical language, however, scientific reports become unintelligible, and research becomes unreplicable. Blurton-Jones [1967], for example, became one of the founders of human ethology when he introduced rigorous operational definitions into his reports of children playing in groups. Before his influential work, the available records defeated attempts at comparison because they presented subjective impressions rather than observations. The meticulous detail with which Blurton-Jones described each category of behaviour makes difficult reading for the dilettante, but it also made new discoveries possible and, more important, the verification and extension of these new discoveries by other investigators. When observations of rough-and-tumble play, for example, could be separated from the several categories usually lumped together as aggressive, they correlated not with aggression but with other forms of play. When six different smiles were carefully identified and tabulated separately, they also appeared in significantly different situations. The oblong smile, for example, appeared in fights between children and in non-social situations involving danger or risk of impact. In MOPS, Harr_ singles out Blurton-Jones' research as an example of 'misplaced positivism' (P. 93).</page><page sequence="4">480 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner At a higher inferential level, certain terms refer to explanations. Explanatory terms cannot refer to observable entities. In Drosophila the character of having red eyes is said to be carried by a gene. We can observe the red eyes of the parents and the red eyes of the offspring, but we cannot observe the gene for eye colour because it is only a term that stands for an explanation of the relationship between parents and offspring. Well after the modern development of genetic theory, electron microscopes were per- fected to the point where scientists could speak of having seen the gene for such characters as the red eye of Drosophila. But, this is only a figure of speech. No matter how great the magnification, what they see is neither red nor shaped like an eye, it is only another correlate of the relationship between the red eyes of parents and offspring and it is entirely identified by that correlation. Like the gene, free will and intention only exist as explanatory constructs, they cannot be observed. Harre and Reynolds claim that they can sense their own intentions. That they cannot name the sense organ is unimportant. What is important is that whatever sensation they may have can only be a correlate of their behaviour, just as the object in the photomicrograph is only a correlate of the eye colour of parents and offspring. To the extent that intention only stands for a correlation between an internal stimulus and an external response, it explains nothing. On the other hand, to the extent that human beings are explaining their behaviour when they speak of intentions-as when we say that we intended to see that movie or write that article, or that we intend to see this movie or write this article-their explanations can be as false as any other explanations. To that extent, like genes or photons or phlogiston, intentions are inferences about nature. Inferences about one's own behaviour are as fallible as inferences about any other sort of behaviour and they must be tested by the same rules of evidence. The 'facial vision' of the blind is a typical case. For hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years philosophers argued about whether blind human beings can locate objects at a distance. The dispute ended in I944 when Dallenbach and his associates placed a 4-ft wide by 7-ft high masonite screen at random places across the path of blind subjects. The path ran lengthwise through a 6o x 2o-ft corridor. The blind subjects were asked to signal by raising one arm when they first detected the obstacle, and to stop walking and raise the other arm when they were about to collide with the obstacle. There were also catch trials in which there was no obstacle. Blind subjects were quite good at detecting and locating the obstacle. Next, normal-sighted student volunteers attempted the same task while blind- folded. They failed at first, but within about 20 trials they, also, could detect and locate the obstacle and their performance approached the accuracy of the blind subjects with a few hours of practice (Supa, Cotzin &amp; Dallenbach [i9441). The experimenters asked both the blind and the sighted subjects to explain how they accomplished the task. About half of the blind and the</page><page sequence="5">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 48 I sighted subjects were convinced that they felt the object on the skin of their faces-their foreheads or their cheeks. This agreed with the consensus of blind people who had been interviewed over centuries of introspective inquiry into this phenomenon. In fact, the phenomenon had come to be known as 'facial vision' and that is the term used in the title of the 1944 article. If these experimenters had been satisfied with 'the unique entree into the human mind' posited by Harre and Reynolds, the investigation would have ended there as it did for so many of their predecessors. Fortunately, the experimental psychologists continued in their external investigation of the phenomenon and demonstrated in a series of precise and rigorous tests that the subjects located obstacles in their path by listening to the echoes of their own footsteps. They could do just as well when their heads were covered with hoods, so long as their ears were exposed. When their faces were bare, but their ears were stopped, they failed. Eventually, the experimenters devised an apparatus that emitted artificial tones and picked up echoes with a microphone. They suspended the apparatus from an overhead track so that it could be moved through the corridor by remote control. Under these conditions, subjects could control the movements of the apparatus and locate the obstacles from another room by listening with headphones to the sounds received by the microphone (Cotzin &amp; Dallenbach [I950]). Both the blind and the sighted university students in this experiment had learned to locate obstacles in the dark by listening to echoes. They, and most of the blind people who down through the ages solved the same problem for themselves, could accomplish this difficult task without being aware of which sense-organ they were using. They could do it even when their mental imagery of facial vision was quite vivid. One of the blind subjects, for example, described faint shadows on his face that became clear and sharp as he approached an obstacle. That so many agreed in their reports of facial images and that they were so firmly convinced of it is a very interesting phenomenon. And yet, neither the numbers of those who agreed nor the strength of their convictions are evidence for the validity or even the relevance of their subjective reports as explanations of their behaviour. 3 PROJECTIVE INTROSPECTION The introspective method has dominated Psychology throughout its history. The experimental method is a relatively recent development and only replaces introspection in certain fields of Psychology to this day. The advantage of the experimental method is that it results in discoveries. The results of introspection, however, never transcend 'common-sense or "folk" psychology' because that is all they really are. Yet, projective introspection ('to generalize outward into the minds of others') is the method recom- mended by the editors of MOPS for deciding whether animals other than man have intentions. Within the covers of MOPS it is also the only method</page><page sequence="6">482 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner used by both philosophers and primatologists to compare the intentions of human and nonhuman primates. It may well be that introspection is the only method that supports intentional explanations of behaviour. In their contributions, Harr6 and Asquith carry this projective technique a step farther. They give us their impressions of a selected sample of ethological writing in order to demonstrate that ethologists intend to attribute intention to nonhuman beings, particularly nonhuman primates. It follows that the ethologists must have the impression that nonhuman primates have intention, from which it follows that nonhuman primates must indeed have intention-at least to some degree. Asquith presents an elaborate linguistic argument to the effect that the use of ordinary language terms in ethological reports entails an intentional interpretation. According to Asquith, her arguments apply not only to terms for general categories such as 'threat', 'appeasement', and 'aggression', but also to more specific terms such as 'greet', 'groom', 'look up', and even 'jump over a fence'. And, this is true no matter how much operational definition the ethologist provides. Behaviour categories are not simply a shorthand for various movements or vocalizations grouped in one manner or another; they mean1 something more. That is, they imply more than can be ascertained from the movement patterns and vocalizations alone. . . behaviour category terms already have established semantic fields in ordinary human discourse in which we normally do wish to impute intentions and feelings to the performer. It is my purpose in the remainder of this chapter to suggest the process by which this anthropomorphic increment occurs. (p. 145) Asquith notes that most ethologists of the past two or three generations have explicitly and repeatedly denied that they mean to attribute human intentions to nonhuman animals by the terminology of their ethological descriptions, or by any other aspect of their ethological writing. She maintains, nevertheless, that all ethologists are hopelessly caught in a Whorfian web of predetermined meaning and useage. Moreover, Besides (and perhaps because of) the fact that many of us mean to ascribe intentions to animals in everyday life, we also use ordinary language terms in scientific discourse about animals because they are appropriate for such description. Their suitability stems from the fact that living creatures are being talked about of whose behaviour we feel some intuitive understanding in everyday experience (based, perhaps, on a common biological heritage). (p. 153) Harre, in his chapter, invokes the same principle in his detailed analysis of the ordinary language terms used in a report of baboon behaviour published by Bachmann and Kummer. Because he finds both intentional and nonintentional terms in the Bachmann and Kummer article, Harre con- cludes that it represents a transitional movement in ethology from noninten- tional to intentional explanations. Presumably because of its 1980 date (no Throughout this article, the italics in quotations are the italics of the original authors.</page><page sequence="7">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 483 other articles, current or past, are analysed), Harre concludes that all of ethology is in the same state of transition from an earlier period of 'misplaced positivism' (p. 93) and that, 'My argument so far has established a strong tendency amongst ethologists to use intentional language in describing the phenomena they observe'. (p. 99) Harre's linguistic analysis of Bachmann and Kummer's intention to attribute intention to nonhuman minds fails to establish anything general about ethologists because of its extremely narrow scope. On the other hand, Harre's resort to such an indirect external route to discover the intentions of a fellow human being clearly contradicts the Harre and Reynolds editorial stance. If, indeed, each human being has a clear inward view of his or her own intentions, and introspective reports must be accepted as scientific evidence, then the way to find out what Bachmann and Kummer meant in their recent article was to ask them. Asking Kummer would have been easy, since Kummer, himself, attended the MOPS conference. As a matter of fact, Kummer's introspective report of his meaning was voiced at the conference. In his printed comments (pp. Io6-107), Kummer politely rejects Harre's reading of Bachmann and Kummer and explicitly denies that Bachmann and Kummer meant to attribute intentions to their baboon subjects. He explains in detail how the terms were defined within their article by the methods of observation. That is to say, the terms were operationally defined as is the practice in ethology and other natural sciences-or at least, that was the intention of the authors. Within the covers of MOPS, Harre fails to acknowledge Kummer's introspective reports of Kummer's subjective experience in any way. Harre and Asquith offer their external linguistic analyses of ethological writings as evidence of the intentions of ethologists. Both are asserting that this external evidence is superior to the introspective reports of most of the ethologists in question. Anyone who rejects introspective reports in favour of external analysis, however, must also reject the thesis that each human being is the indisputable judge of his or her own intentions. But, within the covers of MOPS that editorial thesis is the only warrant we are offered for believing in the existence of human intentions in the first place. Meanwhile, if the ethologists routinely misread the intentions in their own written words, why should we trust them when they attribute intentions to the signals of other primates-particularly when these attributions are unintended? What Harre and Asquith are saying is that ethologists must mean what Harre and Asquith say they mean because of linguistic conventions that no practicing scientist can break. Oddly, the linguistic determinism that Harre and Asquith apply to ethological literature denies freedom and inten- tionality in the human use of language precisely where operationism would grant so much freedom. They play Whorfian Alice to operationism's Humpty Dumpty.</page><page sequence="8">484 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner 'I don't know what you mean by "glory",' Alice said. Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. 'Of course you don't-till I tell you. I meant "there's a nice knock-down argument for you!"' 'But "glory" doesn't mean "a nice knock-down argument",' Alice objected. 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less.' 'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you can make words mean so many different things.' 'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master-that's all.' 4 EXPERIMENTAL ETHOLOGY Operational definition may not be a perfect tool, but it is a sound one and empirical discoveries depend on it. Colour vision, for example, is plainly a phenomenon of subjective experience; Newton, himself, was quick to acknowledge that, 'the Rays to speak properly are not coloured'. The colour is somewhere in the beholder. Although some 2 in 25 European men have deficient colour vision, the phenomenon was unknown to the scientific world until John Dalton's report of his own anomalous experience. Moreover, that talented scientist was in his middle twenties before he realized that his visual world was severely abnormal. In describing his case, Dalton was forced to use the colour words that he had learned from the normal-sighted community. The result remained confusing and misleading on many points until the arrival of modern colorimetry and external definitions of colour vision. How about other animals, do they also have colour vision? According to Harre and Reynolds, Ethology has added a vast richness to this [psychology's] experimental paradigm. We do not need to isolate an animal or to control the input side; we can, by patient observation in natural conditions, discover that certain environmental features are attended to by an animal, and that certain predictable responses follow. In general, the relation between the stimulus and the response is adaptive: it is conducive either to the survival or to the reproductive success of the animal. So we can assume that in the head of the animal there are neural programmes that assess environmental features and selectively activate responses appropriate to them. (p. 5) This quaint description of ethologists as patient observers of nature is a picture of the naturalist that may have been offered to school children two or three generations ago. We hope that most modern readers are better informed. Tinbergen and Von Frisch and their students would be the first to be ruled out of ethology by the MOPS definition. These discoverers are known for their intense commitment to experimentation under natural conditions and for the elegance and rigour of their experiments. This is what set them apart from earlier field naturalists and why they are recognized as the founders of a new field. Early naturalists did, indeed, examine the habits and neurology of different species to see whether these were similar enough to the human case</page><page sequence="9">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 485 to suppose that this or that nonhuman being might see the world in colour, as humans see it. The habits of honey bees, for example, seem to indicate that they distinguish flowers on the basis of colour, but the anatomy and neurology of their eyes and brains are far from human. It was argued, on the one hand, that honey bees only seem to be distinguishing the colour of the flowers and that simpler explanations could account for their behaviour. Some argued that the apparent colour vision of the honey bee is only another case of anthropomorphism in the long history of animal behaviour. Others argued for the simplicity of colour vision itself, that it might not require organs as complex as the human eye and brain. There the matter stood, perennial fuel for debate, until the rigorous and precise experiments of Von Frisch early in this century. Von Frisch showed that bees not only discriminate colours, but that they sort them into groups of primary colours the way human beings do, although they may group them more crudely than humans. He was also able to show that the spectrum of colours visible to the honey bee is shifted away from the red and into the ultra violet; they confuse red with black and see ultra violet as a distinct colour. Plainly, the early natural philosophers could never have achieved these discoveries by the projective introspection prescribed by Harre and Reynolds. Von Frisch's work depended upon an externally verifiable way of observing colour vision-on operational definition. Totally colour blind human beings can still discriminate differences in wavelength. This is because the differential sensitivity of the retina makes lights of different wavelengths appear brighter and dimmer even when they are of equal intensity. Thus, a cat that has learned to push a red panel rather than a green panel to get food has not yet demonstrated that it has colour vision because human beings can do as well without colour vision. We must show that the cat, like human beings with normal colour vision, can continue to choose consistently in the face of extreme variations in the relative intensity of the two panels. Nonhuman subjects often fail the test at this point, but that does not mean that they lack colour vision. It only means that up to that point they were using relative brightness, and it worked. The experimenter must persist in the testing to see if the subjects can recover from this confusion. There are notable examples of nonhuman animals declared to be colour blind by experimenters who gave up too soon. Cats, for example, were declared to be colour blind by several different sets of experimenters. It was only in quite recent times that more ingenious experimenters, who saw that the standard rat reinforcement procedures were inappropriate for cats, were able to demonstrate that cats do indeed have colour vision. Von Frisch's success with the bees also depended on his informed and thoughtful adaptation of testing procedures to the animal under investigation. Seeing the world in colours is more than the ability to discriminate between wavelengths; it is the ability to identify and group objects according</page><page sequence="10">486 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner to colour. In the experiments that have satisfied this requirement, animals showed that they could remember the colours of things. Honey bees can remember more than the colour of flowers, they can also remember the shape of flowers (Gould [1985]). Thus, operational definitions derived from careful experiments permit us to speak with some confidence about the pictorial representation of flowers in a brain as alien to ours as the brain of a honey bee. Further experiments show us that when they return to the hive, these simple creatures with their tiny brains routinely communicate to other bees about distant sources of food. Scouts do not have to pinpoint targets for robotic followers, but rather indicate a promising area of forage. Followers are free to take advantage of other targets that may present themselves, as when a change of wind wafts across the path the scent of richer or closer forage. If there is an obstacle, such as a hill, the followers can reckon the detour into their flight path. When the bees swarm, they form a mass which clings to a convenient branch while scouts search out a favourable site for the new hive. Returning scouts dance on the surface of the mass to communicate their findings. Sometimes their reports disagree. 'Prime location, Ioo metres due South', dances one scout. 'Spectacular site 75 meters North by Northwest', dances another. Each rival recruits followers who reconnoitre the proposed sites for themselves and return to join the debate. The swarm remains until there is consensus, with disastrous results should the debate go on too long. 5 EXPERIMENTAL PRIMATOLOGY Rigorous experimentation under natural conditions is, of course, much easier to accomplish with stickleback fish or honey bees than with more exotic subjects such as vervet monkeys. For a very long time, nearly all scientific information about nonhuman primates was based on short-term, naturalistic observations in the wild and on intensive studies of caged subjects in the laboratory. Rigorous laboratory experiments led to extensive discoveries of the intelligence of monkeys and apes, particularly the line of experimentation on exploratory behaviour and learning sets introduced by Harry Harlow and his associates in the 1940's. Extensive as this literature has been, and as relevant as it is to so many of the discussions in MOPS, one gets the impression that it is virtually unknown to the contributors. The suggestions for future research that appear in the editorial epilogue assume that no such literature exists. During the early period there were also many reports of naturalistic observations of captive groups confined under impoverished and artificial caged conditions. There is a great contrast between this line of research, which included neither experimentation nor anything approaching natural conditions, and the mainstream of ethological research. It was clear to many ethologists and comparative psychologists that the conditions of confine-</page><page sequence="11">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 487 ment distorted the picture of behaviour that was emerging from these observations of captive monkeys. Particularly suspect was the frequency and intensity of agonistic behaviour and the severity of aggression. These suspicions were confirmed by the later, intensive, long-term studies in the wild. Doubts about the validity of studies of caged groups of monkeys were widely expressed from the start. Moreover, the modern field work that has been appearing since the early 6o's is by now extensive and widely-known (cf. any general work on animal behaviour, e.g. Barnett [1981], pp. 353-38 I). Nevertheless, the early approach is heavily represented in MOPS. For his contribution, Reynolds culled from his i962 Ph.D. dissertation on a captive colony of rhesus monkeys a fragment concerned with observations of pathological aggression obviously induced by caged conditions. The level of aggression was severe enough to lead to the death of one monkey and the physical wasting away of another. Reynolds presents his outdated and fragmentary observations as evidence that, ... we are left with a process at the heart of rhesus social life that is rather automatic. It is an evolutionary product, an innate neural response. . . . If Henry had been 'thinking' before his attacks on Anne, it is likely either that he would have 'decided' not to attack at all, or that he would have moderated his bites. (p. 219) Modern investigators spend many months, often years, in continuous observation of naturally occurring groups of monkeys and apes living in their natural habitats. While the functional significance of calls and gestures can be deduced from adventitious observations of correlations between signals, responses, and external events, modern standards of analysis require more conclusive evidence. There must be some experimental manipulation. A good procedure is to record different types of vocal signals and play them back experimentally in neutral situations. Thus, among the calls of the vervet monkey observed in its natural habitat in Africa, are three different alarm calls that have been correlated with the appearance of three different predators, leopards, martial eagles, and pythons. Three different sorts of defensive response are correlated with the different types of predator. The technical problems involved in playing back suitably faithful recordings of these calls under field conditions and at the same time obtaining suitably faithful records of response are enormous. Seyfarth and Cheney must be praised as pioneers who overcame so many technical problems to bring back experimental evidence of the referential value of different vervet calls. 6 COGNITIVE ETHOLOGY Seyfarth and Cheney present a somewhat truncated description of their research programme in MOPS. Rather more complete and informative descriptions appear elsewhere in the professional literature. They have used</page><page sequence="12">488 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner the space saved to air in MOPS some rather specious and overblown speculation about the internal mental life of the vervet monkey. We may further hypothesize that the monkey gives an alarm call because it wants others to believe that there is either (a) something interesting nearby, (b) a predator nearby, or (c) a specific kind of predator nearby. All of these would be second order intentionality. To date, field observations suggest that explanations (a) and (b) can be eliminated, leaving explanation (c) as that most strongly supported by existing data. Throughout such an exercise, the main purpose of Dennett's scheme is to answer the question 'How complex must our human terms be to describe a particular pattern of behavior? When we compare different sorts of communication, which require the most complex terms?' (Seyfarth, p. 41) Dennett's proposal, as presented by Seyfarth, represents an ancient alternative to parsimony. A modern biologist must ask what is added by introducing the term 'believe' into this account of vervet behaviour. The observation that vervet monkeys tend to take to the trees or stay in the trees when they hear call X and leave the trees or stay in ground cover when they hear call Y is hardly grounds for anyone, even the caller vervet, to infer that the hearer believes anything. To an outsider it is certainly thinkable that a vervet monkey could believe that there is an avian predator nearby and stay in the trees anyway, or contrariwise, stay on the ground while believing that a leopard is nearby. It is only if we, and vervet alarmists, conclude that any vervet who believes that there is a leopard nearby will take to the trees or stay there, that the term is warranted at all here. But, in that case, we can also say that the follower bees believe that food is in the location signalled by the scouts, that spiders build webs because they believe that the webs will catch flies, and that laboratory rats (when offered a variety of foods) eat a balanced diet because they believe it is better for their health. Suppose we retreat to the position that the alarmist vervet emits call X because it wants others to be in the trees-thus avoiding the need for any human, or vervet, assumption that vervets believe anything? The trouble now is that, to a nonvervet primate, it is certainly thinkable that a vervet could emit alarm call X, without caring in the slightest, what the others do- or even, while inwardly hoping that the leopard will eliminate some hated conspecifics. The alternative is to conclude that vervet monkeys must want the observed results of their calls. Why else would they call? But then we must also conclude that the scout bees (who also signal only when there is an audience) want the followers to find the food, that spiders want to catch flies, that rats want a balanced diet, and so forth. It is now time to ask what is gained by introducing the term 'want' in the first place. What is gained by saying that the alarmist vervet emits call X when it wants to emit call X, and call Y when it wants to emit call Y, and so on, if all we are saying is that when a vervet emits a call the reason must be that it wants to emit that particular call. By a similar line of reasoning the action of pumps was once explained by nature's hatred for vacuums. It could also be said that Boyle's Law works because nature wants it to work (or hates</page><page sequence="13">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 489 for it not to work). Modern scientists have come to understand that explanations of this type are always empty. Explanatory terms such as 'want' and 'believe' fail, not because they are anthropomorphic, but because they are post hoc. Because they can only furnish explanations after the fact, they can never lead to discovery. They are equally post hoc when applied to human behaviour. Seyfarth uses the term 'mental image' in a similar fashion. When one person uses a word in speaking to another, three important events take place. First, the speaker creates a sound with his vocal organs. For all those who share the speaker's language, this sound represents or 'stands for', a relatively specific set of information. Second, the speaker has some mental image of an object or concept as well as the intent to communicate this image to another. Third, the listener assimilates the information conveyed by the sound, and responds to it. (p. 43) Cheney and Seyfarth claim that their evidence for vocal communication among wild vervets entails the existence of vervet imagery. The pitfalls of this line of reasoning were brought home to us by a cognitive psychologist who visited us recently in our laboratory. Our visitor asked us if Washoe had mental images of our mental images of what she signed to us. The hospitality of the desert being what it is, we only responded with some suitably polite vagaries. Our visitor took our response for an affirmative answer to his question and then pointed out to us that that meant that we had an image of Washoe's image of our image. He further pointed out that, his ability to say what he had just said, meant that he had an image of our image of Washoe's image of our image, and our ability to understand what he was saying meant that we had an image of his image of our image of Washoe's image of our image. Moreover, our visitor had a mathematical theory of images in which each image of an image represented a new level of imagery. The theory could only cope with six levels of imagery, at least at the time of that visit. Approaches that confuse observation with inference and defy the rule of parsimony, lead to infinite regress rather than to discovery. A perennial argument for the role of imagery in human thought that is favoured in MOPS (cf., p. 12) concerns the reports of vivid imagery by famous scientists, such as Einstein. What do such reports, usually long after the fact and often second or third hand, tell us about the function of imagery? Is it that all human beings have these images, but only the Einsteins of the world have the genius to grasp their significance? In that case, the problem of scientific genius remains unchanged. At best, the image becomes a readout of perception and memory, tangentially and trivially related to scientific genius. Is it instead, that scientific geniuses have richer images than those granted to the ordinary run of humanity? If so, where do these superior images come from? Is it the gods, or the Einsteins, themselves, who summon up the images of genius? If it is genius, itself, that does the conjuring, why then it is in preimagery, in the part of the brain that creates images that we must look for the roots of genius. Introspective reports of imagery become distant, distorted echoes of some tangential process.</page><page sequence="14">490 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner Many of the contributions to MOPS depend upon variants of Griffin's model in which intention must be based on imagery. In this view, the individual (whether human or nonhuman) must compare images of the results of various courses of action in order to choose among them. After studying images, 1A, IB, ... N, the individual chooses and then embarks on course, CA, CB, . . . or CN, accordingly. The trouble here is the same as before. If all individuals have roughly the same images, then images are only a form of readout, and choice depends upon the weighting of alternatives in a later stage of processing. In that case, we must explain how this part of the brain chooses the weights without first forming images of the results of different sets of weights, and so on. If, instead, the individual can tamper with the images, themselves, say by adding a little more attractive colour to I,A or by refusing to summon up Ic and ID, why then the critical function is carried out at an earlier stage. Only now we have the problem of explaining how this part of the brain can choose to colour or censor images without first forming preimages of the various sets of tampered and untampered images, and so on. 7 INTROSPECTION AND FOLKLORE How do we distinguish introspective accounts of behaviour from folklore? In some societies there are individuals, called shamans, whose behaviour sets them apart. They may, for example, assume unusual postures, froth at the mouth, and talk in strange voices. Afterwards, the shaman typically reports that he was possessed by a spirit, names the spirit, and recognizes the difference between episodes of possession and ordinary experience. The possession gives the shaman powers to influence the health and well-being of others in the community who thus share in the possession. Modern anthropologists and psychologists cannot deal with this phenomenon if they are forced to accept introspective accounts as literally true. They must be free to doubt the shaman's claim that he was indeed possessed by spirits. They must even be free to doubt the claim that there is any such thing as a spirit in the first place. The same argument applies to the traditional mythologies of wants, beliefs, images, and so forth, that seem so firmly established in Western folklore. If there is any lesson to be learned from the history of science it is that discovery depends upon the ability of scientists to raise doubts about the traditional folklore and to demand external evidence. Structural linguists, such as Chomsky, insist that human beings under- stand and parse novel sentences because human beings claim to have these abilities. External evidence that human beings are inconsistent in their responses to novel sentences is rejected on grounds that such evidence represents performance rather than competence. Nonlinguistic factors such as perception and memory are said to intervene between competence and its outward expression in performance. Thus, we are asked to accept the claim that human beings can understand and parse for the simple reason that</page><page sequence="15">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 49 1 introspective reports contain this claim. All evidence is ruled out, even a vote to determine how many human beings subscribe to the claim. To practicing scientists, such a position is intolerable. All hope of discovering anything new about meaning and language must be abandoned in a discipline that cannot question the prevailing folklore. All claims must be scrutinized, including claims that understanding and grammar exist apart from the folklore. Imagine a physics or a chemistry, or even an economics or a history, in which folklore had to be accepted in favour of empirical evidence. In this connection, an anthropological study of structural linguistics would have been helpful. Consider de Civrieuz's recent account of the Makiritare who live deep in the forests of a mountainous region of Venezuela. They were called Makiritare by the Arawak-speaking guides who were with the Spanish when, in 1759, the first recorded contact was made with this remote people. The Makiritare call themselves, So'to. In their language 'So'to' means simultaneously the language and those who speak the language. Those who do not speak it are regarded as nonhuman- enemies who can be hunted as animals. But individuals from other tribes, usually women and children, who find themselves among the So'to can become So'to as soon as they learn the language. A similar story can be told about many human groups. And, if the story seems exotic to you, consider how little time has elapsed since the days when 'English' or 'Frangais' could have been substituted for 'So'to'. The identification of language with humanity has deep tribal roots. 8 COMMUNICATION AND INTELLIGENCE The notion of unbridgeable gaps between verbal behaviour and the rest of human behaviour and between human intelligence and the rest of animal intelligence becomes ever more difficult to defend. Advances in the study of human communication are rapidly filling in the traditional gaps. The more we learn the more difficult it becomes to specify a gap between prelinguistic communication and language proper, between holophrase and sentence, between gesture and word, between sign languages and spoken languages, or even between action and language. Meanwhile, sign language studies of cross-fostered chimpanzees have revealed further dimensions of continuity. Some discussion of recent discoveries in human communication would seem to be essential for most of the topics covered in MOPS, but the subject is virtually ignored by both editors and contributors. Sign language studies of chimpanzees are brought up throughout the book, perhaps more frequently than any other topic. Neither editors nor contributors, however, seem to be familiar with scientific (as opposed to journalistic) literature in this rapidly developing field. Lieber was chosen to comment on this topic from the point of view of structural linguistics, but his comments are made without reference to any of the scientific developments of the last I 5 years of KK</page><page sequence="16">492 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner a field that was less than zo years old when he was writing. He writes, for example, as if totally unaware that cross-fostered chimpanzees use the inflections of American Sign Language (ASL) very much the way deaf human children do. Nevertheless, published evidence of this has been in the literature since 1978. Project Washoe was replicated and extended with the chimpanzees Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar. The existence of the replications together with all of the more advanced developments in Project Washoe are totally ignored in MOPS. Terrace's contribution to MOPS covers only those aspects of Project Washoe that Terrace replicated with the chimpanzee Nim. Since Terrace failed to replicate most of Project Washoe either in concept, execution, or findings, his review of the field is severely truncated. Unmentioned are: the experimental evidence for communication of natural language concepts, the development of ASL inflections, the abundant records of conversation between chimpanzees including records made with remote video equipment and without any human presence, and the infant chimpanzee Loulis learning signs from his adopted mother Washoe, to cite just a few major findings.1 ASL is highly inflected and makes relatively little use of sign order, but this was the only grammatical device that Terrace studied because, 'sign order is one of the easiest, if not the easiest, grammatical devices [sic] of sign language to record' (p. 181). Several thousand of Nim's utterances were recorded by assistants over a period of about two years. Stripped of all context, verbal or nonverbal, without notes as to who was addressed, what was present, or when in Nim's development they were uttered, all items were fed into a computer and examined for statistical regularities. The statistics that emerged from this exercise proved to Terrace that the sequences were not random and could not have been memorized, but yielded no evidence that the sequences were used grammatically. How could such an analysis demonstrate any meaningful use of sign language? The only meaningful way to use sign order or word order would be to vary order with context. Two utterances such as Nim tickle and Tickle Nim might show meaningful use of order if they occurred in different contexts. In Terrace's analysis they could only cancel each other, and if one occurred significantly more often than the other, the most that we would know would be that the distribution was not random. Operational definition grants something less than complete freedom, after all. To be useful, a report that a particular chamber reached a temperature of 25 degrees Centigrade must include an operational definition of the procedure used to arrive at that number. The interpretation of the observation depends entirely upon the relation of that procedure to I For comprehensive reviews of discoveries in this field during the past x5 years see Fouts, Hirsch and Fouts [1982]; Gardner and Gardner [1978, I985]; and Van Cantfort and Rimpau [1982].</page><page sequence="17">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 493 generally used and generally useful ways of measuring temperature. To the extent that the relation is remote or nonexistent, the results of the experiment are irrelevant to other measurements of temperature. Terrace's statistical analysis of Nim's sign order is negligibly related to any other empirical or theoretical work on the use of sign order or word order as a grammatical or even a communicative device in humans or chimpanzees. Moreover, it is plain that, if the same procedure were applied to the use of sign order or word order by human children, or by human adults for that matter, the result would be equally negative. To the extent that Terrace does give us operational definitions, rather than subjective impressions, his procedures and results can be compared with other research and reinterpreted. Such reanalysis, including further discussion of operationally useful ways of comparing the signed and spoken utterances of chimpanzees and children, can be found in Van Cantfort and Rimpau [1982]. One of the chief inflectional devices of ASL is the combination of elements of two signs into one sign. Because sign languages are visual and spatial, the elements are combined simultaneously rather than sequentially as they are in spoken languages. Both human children and cross-fostered chimpanzees adopt this mode of inflection when they are quite young. Yet, in his analyses of Nim's signing, Terrace systematically eliminated all simultaneous combinations. The reason given is that, when he could not tell which sign came first, he could not tell whether a combination was grammatical. Again, in his readings of selected portions of the Washoe film, Terrace attributes his own inability to distinguish one sign from another and his own ignorance of the pragmatics of ASL conversation to imaginary errors of Washoe's. Terrace's comments on ASL typically illustrate how little he, himself, knew about the language he was supposed to be teaching to Nim (cf. Van Cantfort &amp; Rimpau [1982], pp. 40-47). The few thoughtful and thought-provoking remarks that we could find in MOPS were all contributed by Harris, as in the following comment on Terrace's preoccupation with word order as the test of grammar. ... such assessments are based on rather nebulous views about 'the essence of human language', appealing in particular to the slippery and far from perspicuous concept of a 'rule of grammar'. Anyone who thinks that linguists are in fundamental agreement about what a rule of grammar is ought to acquaint himself at first hand with the diversity of opinion which is evident on that subject in linguistics in recent years.... Even within particular schools of linguistics, quite conflicting views of what a rule of grammar is are to be found. So claims that apes have not shown any ability to operate with 'rules of grammar' are vacuous in the absence of any clear explication of what rules of grammar are. (pp. zo4-zo5) Perhaps the essence of language has been so elusive to so many for so long because it is, in fact, a will-of-the-wisp. There may be no substance after all to the traditional belief in an unbridgeable chasm between Language and the rest of the natural world. The unbridgeable chasm between organic and</page><page sequence="18">494 R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner inorganic also depended on a vital but intangible essence. The history of science has not dealt kindly with the great discontinuities. Eventually recognized as conceptual barriers rather than natural phenomena, most have been passed by and abandoned rather than broken through in the course of scientific progress. We would predict a similar future for the traditional discontinuity between syntax and semantics. To a Darwinist, if human verbal behaviour requires any significant expenditure of biological resources, then it must confer selective advantages on its possessors. In order to confer any selective advantage, however, a biological trait must operate on the world in some way; it must be instrumental in obtaining benefit or in avoiding harm. If clarifying one's ideas confers selective advantage it must be because in some way clarified ideas provide superior means for operating in the biological world. As for establishing social relations, a system of displays and cries is sufficient to maintain group cohesiveness in most animals. The selective advantage of one system of communication over another would seem to be the communi- cation of more information. But, unless verbal behaviour refers to objects and events in the external world, it cannot communicate information and it cannot have any selective advantage. Thus, reference is the Darwinian function of verbal behaviour, and the function of grammar or structure in verbal behaviour must be to enlarge the scope and increase the precision of reference. 9 CONCLUDING COMMENT Darwiri's triumph was a lawful system that could account for the marvellous variety of living forms without invoking the intervention of arbitrary supernatural forces. It is an approach to biology that leads to experimental questions. Experiment, in turn, leads to discovery, and Darwinism prevails throughout biology because it has been a springboard for so many discoveries. Nevertheless, where determinism of blood and bone was rapidly accepted, determinism of thought and feeling is resisted to this day. We see in MOPS and other works of its kind that A. R. Wallace's alternative is still well-entrenched. The Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its extreme logical conclusion, not only does not oppose, but lends a decided support to, a belief in the spiritual nature of man. It shows us how man's body may have been developed from that of a lower form under the law of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we possess intellectual and moral faculties which could not have been so developed, but must have had another origin; and for this origin we can only find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit. (Wallace, 1889, p. 478) Consistent with the emphasis on spirit over substance, we see in MOPS a striking lack of interest in what animals do. Repeatedly, large bodies of pertinent research literature are overlooked as if never consulted. This is particularly noticeable in the frequent editorial calls for starting research</page><page sequence="19">Discovering and Understanding the Meaning of Primate Signals 495 into already well-studied fields. We can only recommend MOPS to those who have an equal lack of curiosity about recent discoveries in animal communication and animal intelligence, and to those who long for a return to a prescientific psychology in which nature could be understood by gazing within and contemplating the soul.
