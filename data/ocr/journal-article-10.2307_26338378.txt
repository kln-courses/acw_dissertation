Juli 2017,  die revidierte Fassung am 12. Oktober 2017. Abstract This contribution compares different aspects of human/animal relationship: animal bones and  teeth as raw material in Palaeolithic art as well as animal representations and therianthropic crea- tures. It can be noticed that the chosen raw material for the production of animal representations  changes chronologically as well as regionally. This choice can be different from one site to the  other and seems to depend on the individual choice of a group of people and not only on the  availability of certain materials. Animals in Palaeolithic art are not just a sort of catalogue of  the hunted fauna. Studies demonstrate that the represented fauna is not identical with the eco- nomically most important fauna. Regional differences concerning the representation of selected  animal species are not necessarily mirroring regional differences in the composition of the game. Keywords: Palaeolithic, art, Europe, animal raw material, animal representations. Introduction Animals are a central subject in Palaeolithic art. In Palaeolithic art animals are raw mate- rial and sculptured object at the same time. This article tries to examine both aspects, the  sculptured and engraved animal raw material on the one hand and the represented ani- mal on the other. It will be discussed if the choice of raw material is only a consequence  of technical requirements and availability or if other motifs may have existed. The list  of painted, engraved and sculptured animals demonstrates that these are not the most  requested food source (ConArd et al. 2015). Apart from animals most important for  the supply of food, also carnivores, swans, owls, bugs and hedgehogs are represented.  Although all of them could have been either part of the Palaeolithic diet or used for their  furs, their remains play a minor role in archaeological inventories. Therefore, we can  suppose other aspects in the relation between humans and these species. HussAin and  Floss made an interesting approach and tried to investigate the role of humans as part of  the animal world. Under this aspect, they analysed the effect of other animals on human  1 Natural History Museum Vienna, Prehistoric Department, Burgring 7, 1010 Vienna, Austria; e-mail:   walpurga.antl@nhm-wien.ac.at </page> <page sequence="2"> 52 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 activities by the example of mammoth and cave lion (HussAin &amp; Floss 2015). Accord- ing to ethnological experience MCniven argues, that the relationship of humans to their  prey was founded on the ontological status of prey as kin. Consequently, hunting of big  mammals was usually accompanied by rituals and ceremonies. Hunters tried to establish  a dialogue with their prey because it is necessary to establish good relations to the ani- mal, which then allows willingly to be taken (ingold 1994; MCniven 2010). This eth- nologically based idea is an interesting contribution to our interpretation of Palaeolithic  art but we will never be able to prove if this was really a premise of Palaeolithic hunt. Based on selected evidence it will be investigated if patterns of use of animal raw mate- rial exist in Palaeolithic art and to what extent the choice of prey effects the choice of  animal representations. We have to be aware that our archaeological record is limited to  less perishable material often covered by meters of sediment and therefore incomplete in  many respects. Interpretations of human behaviour based on this record always remains  hypothetic. Animal parts as raw material Mammoth – bone and ivory The role of mammoth hunting has been heavily discussed. Evidence from Aurignacian  sites in the Swabian Alb for instance show that in contrast to reindeer and horse bones,  mammoth bones show very few traces of meat and marrow use (niven 2006; HussAin  &amp; Floss 2015). These authors suggest that mammoth bones and ivory were collected in  the landscape and that humans did not hunt mammoths in the Swabian Alb. As a matter  of fact, there are studies pro and contra mammoth hunting for the Aurignacian of this  region (gAudzinsky et al. 2005; niven 2006; Münzel et al. 2017). Although mammoth  probably was only a minor source of meat in the Aurignacian of this region, ivory was  with only one exception used for all animal figurines and adornments. The skills in ivory  manufacture were so highly developed, that even flutes were made of ivory. The ivory  objects from the Swabian Alb are the oldest ivory products of Early Homo sapiens so far  (ConArd et al. 2015). In the French Aurignacian, ivory was used for the production of ornaments as for instance  in the Abri Castanet, where hundreds of pearls were found. In Belgium, ivory was also  frequently used for ornaments and points (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006; tAborin  2000). Mammoth remains from the Austrian Aurignacian sites can contribute only little to the  discussion whether mammoth remains are the result of hunting or collecting, because  there exist only few mammoth remains from archaeological contexts of this period. Fur- ther, there are no ivory objects known so far from Aurignacian sites in Austria and South- ern Moravia except the ivory objects from the Late Aurignacian site Alberndorf (Lower  Austria) (steguWeit &amp; trnkA 2008), which is contemporary to the first Gravettian layer  </page> <page sequence="3"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 53 of Willendorf (Willendorf II/5). Therefore we don’t have sufficient archaeological infor- mation about the status of mammoths for Aurignacian hunter-gatherers in these regions,  although mammoths were part of this landscape. Mammoths obviously were neither in  great demand as a source of food, nor do we have evidence that they were part of the  symbolic language of the Aurignacian hunter/gatherers there. During the Gravettian there are changes concerning the use of ivory as raw material for  adornments, tools, weapons, human and animal figurines. The Gravettian layers of the  Swabian Alb for instance first of all comprise rather uniform drop shaped ivory beads as  adornments (ConArd 2003). Tools are preferably manufactured from antler or mammoth  bones, but there are no animal or human sculptures from these layers (Münzel et al.  2017). Unlike in the Aurignacian, mammoth was an important source of nutrition in the  caves of the Swabian Alb in the Gravettian. For sCHeer mammoth is clearly part of the  hunted fauna and probably the reason for the seasonal aggregation of different groups in  this region (sCHeer 2001). The Gravettian sites in Austria and Southern Moravia are also rich in mammoth bones.  In contrast to the Gravettian in the Swabian Alb, where the use of ivory is rather limited  in comparison to the Aurignacian, ivory objects are abundant in the Austrian and South- ern Moravian Gravettian. Ivory was used for weapons, tools, adornments and figurines.  According to svobodA, mammoths could supply meat and fat in quantities the small  animals could not offer, although, there are high numbers of hunted fox, wolf, hare and  reindeer. He therefore suggests, that the Gravettians hunted mammoths (svobodA et  al. 2000). At the Gravettian site Krems-Hundssteig (Lower Austria) FlAderer demon- strated, that breakage patterns and the frequency of skeletal elements are comparable to  that of reindeer and therefore a further argument for mammoth hunting. Mammoth was  essential for the subsistence of people using this place (FlAderer &amp; sAlCHer-JedrAsiAk  2008). According to FlAderer also at Krems Wachtberg (Lower Austria) the subsist- ence was based on mammoth and the landscape was ideal for hunting small groups of  mammoth as it was the case in the hills near Pavlov and the March valley near Stillfried  (FlAderer 2001). At the Gravettian site Grub/Kranawetberg (Lower Austria) mammoth  was very important. People using the campsite in AH4, the lowest layer, accumulated  mammoth bones in a distance of 20–30 m from the campsite. Traces of fire, stone tools,  remains of colour and a perforated mollusc as well as cut marks on bones are evidence  of the human contribution to this mammoth bone deposit (bosCH 2012). Two molars  of the same mammoth jaw – one from the bone accumulation and the other from the  campsite – could establish the contemporaneity of the bone accumulation and the camp- site (bosCH et al. 2012). Big mammoth bone accumulations are a typical feature in  several Gravettian sites from Poland to Lower Austria (svobodA et al. 2005). Among  the mammoth remains at the campsite of Grub Kranawetberg FlAderer noticed cortical  splinters, rib fragments with spiral fractures and transverse stepped breaks as well as  cortical flakes (Antl-Weiser &amp; FlAderer 2004). Apart from mammoth bones, ivory  is abundant in archaeological horizon 4 of this site. Ivory points, ivory buttons, round  ivory bars, a small animal sculpture and 260 beads and pendants of ivory underline the  </page> <page sequence="4"> 54 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 importance of this material (Antl-Weiser &amp; bosCH 2015). A chain of ivory beads was  given to the newborn babies from Krems/Wachtberg (einWögerer et al. 2006). There  exist also some painted ivory fragments from Krems-Wachtberg (Händel et al. 2009).  The Gravettian Layers of Willendorf contained two ivory pendants, several ivory round  bars, one of them with an incised pattern, a fragmented figurine (Venus II) and a possibly  unfinished figurine (Venus III) (FelgenHAuer 1956–1959). The rich ivory industry of  the Southern Moravian sites comprises numerous ivory beads and pendants, diadems,  decorated objects, animal and human figurines as well as silhouettes of animals made of  old ivory. Ivory adornments from Gravettian graves in Barma Grande (Italy) – nine more or less  drop shaped pendants and 4 buttons shaped like a double olive – show that ivory was  a requested material even in areas where mammoth was rare (MAlerbA &amp; giACobini  2014). Gravettian sites in Eastern Europe – e. g., Gagarino, Kostenki, Avdeevo (Russia) – con- tain a great variety of ivory objects: beads and pendants, animal and human figurines.  Almost all complete figurines were made of ivory. The findings from Kostenki 1 and  Avdeevo illustrate, that figurines made of ivory were differently used than those pro- duced of marl (gvozdover 1995). In Magdalenian contexts, ivory becomes clearly less frequent. Most objects are made of  antler, bone or stone but as far as female figurines are concerned ivory is still important.  At Gönnersdorf and Andernach (Germany) female figurines are normally carved from  ivory but there are also examples made from other materials (street et al. 2012). At the  Epigravettian site Kammern/Grubgraben (Lower Austria) two carved ivory plates have  been found – probably the youngest found in Austria so far (neugebAuer-MAresCH  et al. 2008). There are scattered ivory objects from Magdalenian sites all over Europe  like in Spain, where ivory was always rare (AlvArez-FernAndez 2009), or France.  Magedalenian sites in Poland also yielded some ivory objects (benet-tygel 2009).  A fragment of a statuette from Pekarna cave (Czech Republic) is made of ivory (olivA  2005). This might illustrate that ivory was not just another sort of raw material but occu- pied the human mind even in regions where mammoths did not dominate the landscape. In Late Upper Palaeolithic sites in the Ukraine and Russia ivory still predominates at  the production of art objects. In Mezine and Eliseevitchi it was used almost exclusively  (AbrAMovA 1995). The sites in the area of Kostenki differ clearly in the use of raw mate- rial. Apart from ivory, bone and marl is abundant there. Only a few art objects as for instance a relief of a mammoth from the Aurignacian layer  of Vogelherd in the Swabian Alb (ConArd et al. 2015) were sculptured from mammoth  bone. In the Gravettian layers of Willendorf (Lower Austria) a decorated mammoth rib  was found (FelgenHAuer 1956–1959). At the Gravettian site of Avdeevo (Russia) spatu- las with animal heads made of mammoth ribs are frequent. Late Upper Palaeolithic sites  in the Ukraine yielded painted Mammoth bones like a painted skull from Mejziritch and  painted mammoth bones from Mezine (AbrAMovA 1995). Sculptured mammoth ribs  </page> <page sequence="5"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 55 from Eliseevitchi, decorated bones and a female statuette from the Late Upper Palaeo- lithic site Kostenki 2 show that in the Russian plain mammoth bones still served as raw  material for art objects (AbrAMovA 1995). Antler Antler of reindeer was used for the production of tools throughout the Upper Palaeo- lithic. However, most of the mobiliary art and adornments made of antler were found in  Magdalenian context. Art objects or adornments made from antler are only single finds  in Early and Middle Upper Palaeolithic sites, like for instance an imitation of a red deer  canine from the Hungarian Aurignacian site Istallöskö (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006)  or a tool made from reindeer antler from the Gravettian layers of the Hohle Fels showing  an engraved animal (ConArd et al. 2015). In Magdalenian sites reindeer antler is frequently used for decorated objects like batons  or the endings of spear throwers. Most of the artefacts produced from antler are rein- deer antler; only a few pieces are from red deer. Apart from two examples on bone  the engravings from Kesslerloch (Switzerland) were found on pieces of reindeer ant- ler (bAndi 1977). A decorated baton from the Epigravettian site Kammern/Grubgraben  (Lower Austria) is also made from reindeer antler (neugebAuer-MAresCH et al. 2008).  The abundant use of antler is typical for the Magdalenian sites in Western and Central  Europe. In Eastern Europe art objects made of antler are very rare like for instance the  bird sculptures from Yudinovo (Russia), the round bars from Kosseoutzy and Klimao- utzy (Moldavia) (AbrAMovA 1995). In the Late Palaeolithic of the Ukraine reindeer and red deer antler were manufactured  besides of ivory. Molodova V yielded a harpoon made from red deer antler, a musical  object from reindeer antler and several other objects of reindeer antler together with  ivory artefacts (AbrAMovA 1995). Bone Throughout the Palaeolithic bones of different animals were used for the production of  symbolic objects but bone always seem to have played a minor role. Besides mamma- lian and bird bones also vertebrae of fish were used, e. g., as part of necklaces in French  Aurignacian sites like Roc de Combe and Gatzarria (vAnHAren &amp; d’erriCo 2006). In  Magdalenian sites vertebrae of fish are often used as pendants like at the Zigeunerfels  in Southern Germany, in the Magdalenian graves of La Madeleine (France) and Barma  Grande (Italy) as part of necklaces in combination with red deer canines. In the early Aurignacian layers of the caves in the Swabian Alb apart from ivory flutes, the  remains of four bone flutes – swan and griffon vulture – were unearthed. In Aurignacian  and also in Gravettian layers adornments from shortcut tubular bones are especially dis- tributed in the Swabian Alb, Belgium, France and Spain (vAnHAren &amp; d’erriCo 2006). </page> <page sequence="6"> 56 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 Perforated and/or incised bones are present in Aurignacian and Gravettian layers from  Southern Moravia and Austria. From Mladeč there are for instance metacarpals from  giant deer or elk perforated in the epiphyses (olivA 2006). Bone fragments with par- allel or crossed incisions are known from the Gravettian of Aggsbach as well as from  Willendorf (FelgenHAuer 1951; FelgenHAuer 1956–1959). Similar pieces are docu- mented in Russian Gravettian sites like Kothylevo II or Avdeevo (AbrAMovA 1995). For  these pieces, bones of birds, wolves and also bigger animals like reindeer or horse were  decorated. In Magdalenian contexts engraved animals on pieces of bone can be found from France  to Lower Austria. In Magdalenian sites bone is frequently used for engravings like at  La Vache in France (WeHrberger 1994), the Kesslerloch in Switzerland or the Pekarna  cave in the Czech Republic (Müller-beCk &amp; AlbreCHt 1998). The only example of a  Magdalenian engraved bone from Austria was found in the Gudenushöhle (Lower Aus- tria) – the head of a reindeer on the ulna of an eagle with a series of structured incisions  (Antl-Weiser 2011). At the Epigravettian site Kammern/Grubgraben (Lower Austria) a  flute made of the tibia of a reindeer was part of a rich inventory comprising bone, antler,  and a few decorated ivory artefacts (einWögerer &amp; käFer 1998). At the Late Upper Palaeolithic site Eliseevitchi (Russia) a series of bones of arctic fox  were decorated (AbrAMovA 1995). Animal teeth Fox teeth were perforated and worn as adornments throughout the Upper Palaeolithic of  Europe. Teeth of this animal species are most frequently used among all animal teeth.  In the Aurignacian perforated fox teeth were spread in Southern Germany, Belgium,  France, Spain, Italy and Russia, but they were especially wide spread in France (vAn- HAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006). Based on forty Aurignacian sites Taborin mentions that fox  canines – the most frequent animal teeth – constitute more than one third of all animal  teeth in the French Perigordian, followed by bovine and wolf (tAborin 2000). They are  also found in Gravettian layers of the Swabian Alb (ConArd 2003), Southern Moravia  (kliMA 1997) and Austria (FelgenHAuer 1956–1959; Händel et al. 2009). In Austria  fox teeth are also part of Magdalenian (oberMAier &amp; breuil 1908) and Epigravettian  inventories (neugebAuer-MAresCH et al. 2008). They are equally present in Eastern  Europe – Moldavia, Ukraine and Russia – from the Aurignacian to the Late Palaeolithic  (AbrAMovA 1995). Modified wolf teeth are considerably less frequent. They are especially spread in the  French Aurignacian but there are also pieces from Belgium and Germany (vAnHAren  &amp; d’erriCo 2006). A few pieces were documented in Gravettian sites from the Swabian  Alb (ConArd 2003; ConArd et al. 2015), Southern Moravia (kliMA 1997) and Austria  (Händel et al. 2008). Selected finds are reported from the Gravettian in Russia and the  Late Upper Palaeolithic in Russia and the Ukraine (AbrAMovA 1995). </page> <page sequence="7"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 57 As red deer is an abundant prey in the French and Spanish Aurignacian canines of red  deer are frequently used in this area. There are also examples from Belgium, Italy and  Croatia (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006; broglio &amp; gurioli 2004). In the Swabian  Alb canines of red deer were found in Aurignacian, Gravettian and Magdalenian layers  (ConArd 2003; ConArd et al. 2015). In Magdalenian sites in France (vAnHAeren &amp;  d’erriCo 2005), Italy, Austria and in Late Upper Palaeolithic sites in Eastern Europe  (AbrAMovA 1995) red deer canines are documented. vAnHAeren and d’erriCo sug- gest that red deer canines could have been a marker for eventual social ranking in the  Magdalenian of France because of the big number of red deer canines from the burial in  Saint Germain la Rivière (District Gironde) despite of a virtual absence of red deer in  contemporary sites of this area (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2005). There is only a small number of bear canines from Aurignacian contexts in Central  Europe, Belgium and France and even fewer examples from Central European Gravet- tian sites. In the Late Upper Palaeolithic there are some pieces from the Ukraine (AbrAM- ovA 1995). Teeth from large and medium sized bovids (mainly from bison and ibex)  have a certain importance on a rather regional scale and are mainly distributed in the  French Aurignacian with one exceptional find in the Wildscheuer in Germany (vAn- HAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006). Perforated horse teeth are known from Aurignacian layers in  Germany (the Swabian Alb and Hessen), Belgium, France and Southern Moravia. The  number however, is very low (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006). In the Swabian Alb horse  teeth are typical for the Late Aurignacian to the Gravettian (ConArd et al. 2015). In the  Gravettian the frequency is even smaller, there are only single examples from Southern  Moravia (kliMA 1997) and Austria (FelgenHAuer 1956–1959). Modified teeth of rein- deer are equally rare like at the Aurignacian site Rois in France (vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo  2006), in the Aurignacian and the Gravettian from Hohle Fels (ConArd et al. 2015), the  Magdalenian site Gönnersdorf, where complete rows of incisors had been cut in one  from the jaw (bosinski 1975), as well as Andernach and Petersfels (ConArd 2003).  Modified teeth of reindeer are also known from the Late Upper Palaeolithic of Moldavia  (AbrAMovA 1995). Teeth of some species like lion (French Aurignacian), boar (Aurignacian in Belgium),  ibex (Aurignacian of the Swabian Alb, France and Spain), hyena (Aurignacian of France  and the Swabian Alb, vAnHAeren &amp; d’erriCo 2006), elk (Aurignacian of Southern  Moravia), beaver (Aurignacian of Southern Moravia and the Ukraine), and bison (Late  Upper Palaeolithic in the Ukraine) are rarely represented. Apart from numerous sites  where animal teeth were used as adornments there are also some sites with numerous  adornments but without any modified animal tooth. From Aurignacian sites in Austria  there are no modified animal teeth so far, which might be due to the predominantly old  excavation record. The Gravettian sites in Austria yielded a series of perforated animal  teeth despite the old excavation record. At Grub Kranawetberg however, the situation is  quite exceptional as there is a huge assemblage of adornments (260 beads and pendants  of ivory and 170 pieces and fragments of mollusc shells collected in the outcrops of  marine sediments of the region) but not a single modified animal tooth. Nevertheless,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 58 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 there are unmodified teeth of fox, wolf, horse and reindeer at this site (Antl-Weiser &amp;  bosCH 2015). A similar situation can be found in the Gravettian in Russia (Kothylevo II)  and the Late Upper Palaeolithic in the Ukraine (Mezine) (AbrAMovA 1995). Regarding the distribution of modified teeth from different animals, it can be observed  that teeth from animal species which were important for food supply are underrepre- sented. Teeth of smaller carnivores are preferably used, whereas teeth of bear and lion  are rather exceptional. Canines of red deer seem to have been a sought after material  even in areas and environments where red deer was not part of the fauna. Some forms of  ivory beads are said to be imitations of red deer canines. Representations of Animals Mobiliary Art Aurignacian Representations of animals may provide evidence of the mental concept of early modern  humans and their relationship to animals. The Southwest of Germany is outstanding in  the production of animal sculptures as for instance from Geissenklösterle, Vogelherd,  Hohlenstein-Stadel and Hohle Fels several animal representations made of ivory were  discovered. Most frequently, mammoth is represented but also bison, bear, horse, lion  and bird. New archaeological research at the Vogelherd cave also detected representa- tions of fish and possibly hedgehog. The hunted fauna from this site is dominated by  reindeer and horse, but there are also bovids, red deer, chamois, wild boar and mammoth  (ConArd et al. 2015). Except horse and bovids the hunted fauna is not represented by  the animal sculptures. Bear, lion, bird, fish and hedgehog must have had a significance  apart from subsistence. Mammoth, which is represented most frequently, was not of vital  importance for the subsistence of the people at the Vogelherd. At the Geissenklösterle  figurines of mammoth, bison and bear were detected, whereas the most important fauna  for the subsistence was mammoth, wild horse, reindeer and roe deer. The situation at the  Hohle Fels is slightly different because the hunted fauna – mammoth, wild horse, rein- deer, birds, fish and cave bear – is partly represented in figurines – the head of a horse,  a water bird and a sculpture half man, half lion – with no other animals. The animal  sculptures from the Swabian Alb are the only animal figurines from Aurignacian sites,  although for instance adornments carved from ivory are widely spread in Aurignacian  sites in France and Belgium. The important role that mammoth obviously played in the worldviews of Aurignacian  hunter gatherers in the Swabian Alb is mirrored by the series of mammoth sculptures and  the importance of ivory for the production of figurines of different animals and various  adornments found in the caves of this region. A possible explanation for the discrep- ancy between the role of this animal for the human diet and its role in their worldviews  </page> <page sequence="9"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 59 is given by HussAin and Floss by the example of the Samburu, who consider that the  Samburu and the elephants belong to the same kind although they inhabit different bod- ies. Elephants are seen as persons and killing them would seriously endanger the rela- tionship between humans and elephants. They regard ivory ornaments as a protection  against curses of elephants, which formerly had been hunted. As the activities of mam- moths in the landscape have many positive effects for the human subsistence Hussain  and Floss suggest that the Aurignacian record of the Swabian Alb might reflect similar  attitudes (HussAin &amp; Floss 2015). This illustrates that there might exist different ties  between mammoths and humans where our archaeological record is only fragmentary  and gives often ambiguous answers. Nevertheless, there are also arguments for mam- moth as a hunted animal in the Aurignacian of the Swabian Alb (Münzel et al. 2017).  Wolf explains the exclusive use of ivory for the manufacture of animal figurines with  ivory being the only material suitable for the production of bigger sculptures (WolF  2015). Regarding the animal sculptures of the Swabian Alb their dimensions are in most  cases not too big for antler or mammoth bone. The flutes made of ivory show, that people  from the Swabian Alb not always chose the most suitable material. Therefore, it can be  supposed that ivory had a special meaning for Palaeolithic hunter/gatherers. In Austria  and Southern Moravia animal representations from that time are unknown so far. In Italy  possible representations of animals were found among the drawings on pieces of rock  from the Aurignacian layers of the Fumane cave (broglio &amp; gurioli 2004). The rather  stylized painting cannot be attributed to a certain species. It also cannot be excluded that  these pieces of rock originally were part of wall paintings. A stone block from the Abri  Cellier (France) also shows engraved animals from the Early Upper Palaeolithic (WHite  et al. 2017) Gravettian Gravettian layers of the Hohle Fels show that mammoth is more frequently hunted than  in the Aurignacian but reindeer and wild horse are still important. Ivory was still impor- tant for the production of adornments. An engraved animal on the antler of reindeer from  Hohle Fels (ConArd et al. 2015) is only an outline of an animal, but cannot be clearly  identified. This engraving is the only animal representation from the Gravettian at the  Swabian Alb. In contrast to the Swabian Alb the oldest representations of animals in the eastern part of  Central Europe are known from the Early Gravettian (Pavlovian). In Southern Moravia,  especially at Dolní Vĕstonice and Pavlov, animal sculptures of fired clay are abundant,  but there are also a few ivory figurines. Figurines of bears, lions and horses are most fre- quent, followed by owls and single representations of mammoth, woolly rhino, wolver- ine, fox, reindeer and marten. Ceramic figurines are present in Dolní Věstonice I, Pavlov  I and Předmost. In Pavlov I figurines of a mammoth and a lion are carved from ivory.  Another ivory mammoth was found at Předmost (verpoorte 2001). Among the four most  frequently represented animals (8 lions, 8 horses, 7 bears and 6 owls) only horses were  </page> <page sequence="10"> 60 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 important for the subsistence of these people. The number of taphonomically identified  animals is dominated by mammoth (35 individuals), reindeer (38), horse (33), hare (56),  polar fox (42), red fox (7), wolverine (4), birds (2), lion (1), bear (1), rhino (1) (Musil  1997). Three out of four animal species sculptured most frequently are either not among  the hunted fauna or only with one individual. Interestingly horse is the only animal, which  is as well part of the favoured game as frequently represented among the art objects. Horse, lion and bear were already represented in the art of the Swabian Aurignacian; the  role of mammoth however is – compared to the Aurignacian of the Swabian Alb – less  prominent in the Early Gravettian Art of Southern Moravia. Mammoth representations  are not as frequent and ivory as raw material for animal figurines is not so important. In four out of seven areas with animal representations lion is associated with horse and  in two cases enlarged with owls and bears. The biggest variety of animal figurines is doc- umented in Dolní Věstonice I, Northwest with 4 horses, 3 owls, 2 lions, a mammoth, a  bear, a wolverine, a woolly rhino and a marten. Near the famous Venus I from Dolní Věs- tonice a bear, an owl and the head of a reindeer was found. Almost all representations are  fragmented and were found near a hearth. According to verpoorte (verpoorte 2001)  they supposedly have not been produced to be kept by their producers over a period of  time. They had been sculptured and put at the hearth still wet and therefore they cracked  when heated, possibly as part of a ritual act. In Lower Austria a few ceramic objects were found near hearth 1 at Krems-Wachtberg.  An amorphous object shows papillary lines of human fingerprints and the impression  of a fingernail. The other one is a part of an animal body, either horse or cervid or  the head of a horned animal possibly a saiga (HAendel et al. 2009). Josef bAyer had  already excavated two other animal figurines but they have not been identified as ani- mal representations at first sight (einWögerer 2000). An unidentifiable representation  of an animal made of ivory was found at the Kranawetberg in Grub (Antl-Weiser &amp;  bosCH 2015). There are no animal representations from the younger Gravettian (Willen- dorf-Kostenkian) in Austria and Southern Moravia. In Eastern Europe Avdeevo, Gagarino, and Kostenki I, 4 and 11 are the most prominent  sites of the Willendorf-Kostenkian with a big number of animal figurines made of ivory,  marl and also of fired clay (AbrAMovA 1995), which is in contrast to the situation in Cen- tral Europe. The finding of a mammoth sculpture beneath the shoulder blade of a human  skeleton at Sungir (Russia) (kölbl 2003) illustrates the importance of mammoth and  its symbolic significance for Palaeolithic hunter/gatherers. Among thousands of ivory  beads and other ivory grave goods from the burials at Sungir also a horse pendant with  a series of points in line was found (Floss 2003). The inventory of Avdeevo (Russia)  contains an assemblage of ivory points with animal heads in different styles – triangular  with ears or more naturalistically formed animal heads. The artists from Avdeevo took  bone, probably from mammoth, and sandstone for the mammoth sculptures (gvozdo- ver 1995). The horse from Avdeevo was made of ivory. The raw material of the lion  head from Kostenki I is limestone (AbrAMovA 1995). </page> <page sequence="11"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 61 Comparing Aurignacian and Gravettian complexes it can be observed that Gravettian  sites without animal sculptures follow the Aurignacian sites of the Swabian Alb contain- ing a big variety of animal representations. In the eastern parts of Central Europe it is  most likely vice versa. Pavlovian sites with numerous fragments of animal figurines in  fired clay and ivory follow the Aurignacian sites without animal sculptures. From the Early Aurignacian in Western Central Europe to the late Gravettian in East- ern Europe the way of production, the choice of material and the style of animal rep- resentations changed remarkably. The example of the reconstruction of the lion man  from Hohlenstein-Stadel demonstrated that producing ivory sculptures is a rather hard  enduring work (Hein &amp; WeHrberger 2010). Ivory objects obviously seem to have been  produced to last for a longer period, which implies that the finished sculptures had some  sort of lasting function for their producers either as individuals or as a group of people.  In contrast to that most of the Pavlovian animal figurines were not produced to be kept  at all. Their function seems to have ended with their placing at the hearth. The Pavlovian  ivory figurines are often silhouettes of animals. In the Willendorf-Kostenkian sites of  Eastern Europe animals made of ivory represent mammoth, horse, birds and possibly  bison. Animals and animal heads of sandstone, marl or fired clay show mainly mam- moths or bears. The most prominent animals in Aurignacian as well as in Gravettian mobiliary art are  mammoth, horse, bear and birds, followed by lion and bison. We do not know if and  to what extent the symbolic content of these animals changed in the course of almost  20.000 years, or if the rituals connected with these figurines changed. Producing an ivory  figurine required special knowledge and big investment of time. The ivory figurines  could be used in rituals repeatedly, although we do not know if they really were. As far  as the ceramic figurines from Pavlovian sites are concerned, the production itself seems  to have been the ritual act. The still wet clay figurine was put to or into the fire and thus  transformed into a new, artificial material. The remaining animal fragments seem to have  been of no further importance after this transformation. Magdalenian Magdalenian animal representations differ from earlier portrayals in the choice of raw  material, the choice of technique as well as the choice of animal species. New materials  like slate, jet and amber are used apart from antler and bone. Ivory is rare, but female  figurines are often produced of this material. “Animal shaped endings” of spear throw- ers are usually sculptured of antler and sometimes also of ivory. Engravings are now a  widely used technique for representing animals. As far as the represented animal species  are concerned mammoth is no longer important for subsistence, but is still used for art  objects and is also portrayed even in areas, where mammoth was never or no longer eco- nomically important. The preferred game are reindeer and wild horse, but horse is prefer- ably depicted. Although reindeer was economically equally important as horse since the  beginning of Upper Palaeolithic, horses seem to have inspired people in a particular way. </page> <page sequence="12"> 62 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 Magdalenian animal pictures are frequently engraved on plates of slate like the rich  assemblage from Gönnersdorf in the Rhineland-Palatinate. From this site not only a  huge corpus of animal pictures is known but also a big variety of depicted species: four  horses, one of them in combination with two birds, two pieces with mammoths and  single representations of aurochs, saiga, rhino, seal, ptarmigan and raven (bosinski &amp;  FisCHer 1980; Müller-beCk &amp; AlbreCHt 1998). In German Magdalenian sites numer- ous horse engravings are recorded. Horses are engraved on slate, antler, stone, amber and  bone. A bot fly nymph and a beetle sculptured of jet from the German Magdalenian are  among the rarely depicted animals. Ibex is known from the Rislisberghöhle (in the swiss  canton Solothurn), fish from Petersfels and a birds head from Andernach, both Germany.  Most of the Czech animal representations are documented at the Pekarna cave like bison,  horse, ibex and bear. (Müller-beCk &amp; AlbreCHt 1998). In Austria the head of a reindeer was engraved on an ulna of a sea eagle (Antl-Weiser  2011). From the Late Palaeolithic in Austria we should mention the engraving on a piece  of antler from the Zigeunerhöhle near Graz (Styria) interpreted as a rapidly moving  snake (Antl-Weiser 1993). The engraved lion from Gönnersdorf is one of the rare lion representations of the Magda- lenian in Central Europe (bosinski &amp; FisCHer 1980). The French and Italian Magdale- nian yielded a series of lions engraved in bone or as a relief on limestone (WeHrberger  1994). A mammoth from Bruniquel on the ending of spear thrower was sculptured from  antler. The swimming reindeers from this place on the contrary were sculptured from  ivory. Regarding the spear thrower endings of a jumping horse from Bruniquel and the  fighting ibex from Les Trois Frères (leroi-gourHAn 1971) the Bruniquel mammoth  shows convergent legs like a dead animal. At the Duruthy rockshelter (France) sculp- tured horses of sandstone, marl limestone and ivory were found together with horse man- dibles (birouste et al. 2016). The authors suggest to interpret this find with animistic  practices. Ibex is mainly represented in a series of Magdalenian sites in the French and  Spanish Pyrenees as silhouette, on slabs of stone or as decorated bar (CAstelli 2010).  The animals from Kesslerloch (Switzerland) comprise engraved horses and grazing rein- deers on the antler of a reindeer. The head of a musk ox from this site was sculptured  from reindeer antler (bAndi 1977). An evidence that mammoth still occupied the human mind, even in areas where mam- moth was probably not part of the landscape anymore, is an engraving on a slab of  stone from the Magdalenian site Las Caldas in Asturia (bAHn 1999; AlvArez-Fernán- dez 2002). There are no animal representations from Late Upper Palaeolithic Eastern  Europe and Siberia (AbrAMovA 1995). Therianthropic figurines Creatures combining human and animal characteristics are a typical phenomenon for the  Early Upper Palaeolithic of Germany and Italy as well as for the Middle to Late Upper  Palaeolithic of France. These characteristics can be observed at the lion man from the  </page> <page sequence="13"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 63 Hohlenstein-Stadel, the small lion man from Hohle Fels and an anthropomorphic fig- urine from Vogelherd. Even the relief from Geissenklösterle may combine human and  animal characteristics. The combination of man and lion documented at the Hohlenstein-Stadel and Hohle Fels  (Swabian Alb) reflects not only the observation of animals by early modern humans but  also the identification with parts of their character. Deep thoughts about the character  of an animal are a precondition for this sort of representation, which is not the result  of an observation from outside but of an effort to imagine animal sense and character.  At the same time, it shows the ability of early modern humans to search after human  characteristics in animals comparing it with animal characteristics inside themselves.  HussAin and Floss argue, that lions may have been regarded by Palaeolithic people  rather as a fellow hunter than just as an animal and the special relationship being a  consequence of competition between humans and lions (HussAin &amp; Floss 2015). The  arms of the so called lion man from Hohlenstein-Stadel are parallel to the body with  an angle between upper arm and forearm, which produces the allusion of vigilance.  There are also a series of parallel incisions on the upper arm of the lion man from  Hohlenstein-Stadel similar to the signs on the upper arms of the figurine from Hohle  Fels (ConArd et al. 2015). A painting from the Aurignacian layer of the Fumane cave (Italy) represents a human  being with a horned head. The anthropomorphic figurine is painted in red ochre on a  fragment of dolomitized oolithic limestone. Below the neck of the figurine there are  stretched out hands, the right one holding something hanging down. The body widens  at the hips and the legs are bow shaped. The painting is interpreted as witch doctor or  shaman. broglio and gurioli compare it with felines from Vogelherd, engravings of  the Dordogne shelters and the Chauvet cave (broglio &amp; gurioli 2004). Apart from human-lion combinations there are also combinations of a female body with  the head of a horned animal. A bar from red deer antler from Magdalenian context in Las  Caldas near Oviedo in Asturia shows a female body with hooves and a horned animal  head (HAHn 1994). Another example of this combination is painted on the walls of the  Chauvet cave. A mammoth – known as the young mammoth – from the grand panel from  the Chauvet cave was also discussed to show anthropomorphic characteristics because  of the round endings of its legs. Bahn however interprets these endings as painted animal  tracks (bAHn 1999). The most famous examples of human-animal representations are known from Fran- co-Cantabrian cave art. The French cave of Les Trois Frères comprises two of these  representations. One of them – the well known sorcerer, also named “the horned god” –  is a combination of painting and engraving. The depicted being is painted dancing or  springing with stretched out hands. The second representation is a creature with the head  of a bison and also dancing with stretched out hands. A similar painting was found in Le  Gabillou. Hahn mentions another example from Le Fontanet showing a human-animal  being, which cannot be determined more closely (HAHn 1994). Leroi-Gourhan reports  </page> <page sequence="14"> 64 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 at least 15 sites with therianthropic beings. All of them of them are a combination of a  human lower part of the body whereas the upper part and the head resembles an ani- mal (leroi-gourHAn 1971). According to Hahn these creatures are interpreted as sha- mans or sorcerers being often placed in a marginal position of the area with paintings.  Although they are in general attributed to the Magdalenian their chronological classifi- cation is uncertain (HAHn 1994). Cave art Hands on cave walls, therianthropic creatures, animals from insects to mammoth and  mysterious signs are the most impressive representatives of Palaeolithic art. The central  theme of cave art are animals painted in different techniques, engraved or even sculp- tured from the loam of the cave. They give evidence of very accurate observations by  the Palaeolithic artists. In the flickering light of the lamps also the wall itself becomes an  important agent by its cavities and bumps in order to place the right animal to the most  adequate place. Did the artist look for the right place to portray the animal he imagined  or did he/she recognize a distinct animal through the play of light and shade given by the  wall of the cave? For the supposed symbolic character of the act of painting it makes a difference whether  the cave was entered to “find” an animal or just to look for the ideal position. It would  also make a difference if painting an animal etc. was only part of a symbolic act like  painting animals and signs seen in trance or as a part of rituals. The therianthropic beings  are often interpreted as a certain stage in trance (Clottes 1997). Another question con- cerns the choice of the represented animals. While early research explained the cave  paintings by hunting magic, the discrepancy between the hunted fauna and the rep- resentations contradicts this opinion (HAHn 1986; Clottes 2000). dJindJAn however  explains part of this discrepancy between the hunted and the presented fauna by a local  and a distant knowledge of animals. A mixture of animals from different climatic zones  may exist according to the seasonal mobility of people (dJindJiAn 2004). Nevertheless,  this does not explain the relatively big number of lions, bears and woolly rhinos, which  certainly did not belong to the most frequently hunted animals. On the other hand, these  species could well be among the most prestigious prey. A main problem in the interpretation of cave paintings is a chronological one. It would  be a very ambitious approach to date all representations on cave walls, on the other hand  without a chronological framework we will not even know, which representations are  contemporaneous. Consequently, we do not know which representations are parts of  the same symbolic context. As demonstrated by the new findings in the Grotte Chauvet  and some Cantabrian caves it seems clear that the stylistic system of leroi gourHAn  (leroi-gourHAn 1971) has to be revised by absolute data or revised by a new stylistic  approach based on these new data. On the other hand, the data from Grotte Chauvet,  respectively their relevance for the age of the paintings, is still being discussed (pettitt  &amp; bAHn 2014). </page> <page sequence="15"> Antl: Animals in palaeolithic art 65 As far as the represented animals are concerned horses and bovids are most frequent but  the mixture of species varies from one cave to the other. Lions for instance are not so  frequent compared to other species – but they are more common in Chauvet, Lascaux  and Trois Frères. A lion from Trois Frères looks as if it was just turning around with  attentive eyes (WeHrberger 1994). Mammoth is not prevalent as well, but in the cave of  Rouffignac mammoth dominates with158 images followed by 28 bisons, 16 horses, 12  ibex, 11 rhinos and a bear (plAssArd 1999). After a count of leroi-gourHAn mammoth  ranges at the third place after bison, but with only a third of the images attributed to horse  (leroi-gourHAn 1971). This count might have changed with the paintings from Grotte  Chauvet, which was detected in 1994. Mammoth is represented in numerous paintings  there. The most impressive among them is a mammoth in the middle of the grand panel  between lions and rhino with an almost anthropomorphic posture, an aspect, which was  already mentioned above (bAHn 1999). It also reminds us to the relation between humans  and elephants addressed by Hussain and Floss (HussAin &amp; Floss 2015). Looking for the images of cervides we find red deer dominating in comparison to rein- deer. Pictures of bear, lion and rhino range far behind. As previously mentioned these  animal pictures are not evenly spread. Mammoth is only at the third place because of the  concentration of Rouffignac. leroi-gourHAn demonstrates regional differences con- cerning the preference of certain animal species (leroi-gourHAn 1971). If we compare  the figures for horse and reindeer/red deer – all of them economically important – we  realise, that horse must have been preferred for other, probably symbolic reasons. This  dominance of horse is not only typical for the Franco-Cantabrian cave art, but also for  the Magdalenian mobiliary art in Central Europe. Viewing at the way of presentation, we can see rather immobile animals from the side,  but also animals approaching the spectator like the lion from Les Trois Frères. Some  animals look just killed like the bison from Lascaux. In the Chauvet cave there is another  stylistic effect: rhinos closely one after the other and many rhino horns in a rather nar- row sequence, which was interpreted as the image of a stampede – a sort of Palaeolithic  motion pictures. They observed the same principle at horse representations on a slab  from La Marche (France), where there is horse in the centre and the head as well as the  legs are multiplied (AzéMA &amp; rivère 2012). Conclusions Regarding the animal representations as a whole we notice that Upper Palaeolithic  hunter/gatherers portrayed animals in a very realistic way. They chose species, which  had beyond their economical value a deeper meaning for them. The choice of animal  species differs regionally as well as chronologically, although some animals like for  instance horse and mammoth had a supra regional importance throughout the Upper Pal- aeolithic. In some cases the used raw materials seem to have had an extra value. May be  that it was rare, prestigious or having a symbolic meaning. Antler, bone and stone were  replacing ivory, which was predominant in the Early and Middle Upper Palaeolithic,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 66 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 more and more during the Magdalenian but obviously without losing its fascination even  in areas, where mammoths were rare or absent. In Eastern Europe mammoth and ivory  remains dominant until the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. Observations concerning shamanistic or animistic practices are often mentioned together  with animal representations and therianthropic creatures, but it might be dangerous to  conclude that the same thoughts were behind similar appearances. We can be rather  sure that people reflected on the abilities and qualities of animals and compared some  of these qualities with their own. It could also be that myths and legends influenced the  preference of certain animals. As far as cave art is concerned, the main difficulty for an interpretation is the lack of a  secure chronological setting of many representations. This inhibits conclusions concern- ing the layout of the paintings in a cave, or the intentional arrangement of scenes. It also  makes it impossible to trace the development of different styles.
