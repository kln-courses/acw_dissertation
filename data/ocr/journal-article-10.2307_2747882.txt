<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION* BY ROBERT S. LEE A nationwide survey indicates that the American public views the electronic computer and its significance in terms of two independent belief-attitude dimensions. The first views the computer as an instrument of man's pur- poses-helpful in science, industry, space exploration, etc. The second portrays the machine as a relatively autonomous entity that can perform the functions of human thinking. People tend to react with awe and a sense of inferiority to this latter conception. Individual variations in the strength of these reactions to the computer are related to certain personality factors and life orientations that are highly pervasive in character. The author is a social psychologist at IBM, where, for the past few years, he has been doing research in the area of educational technology. Before this, he was in charge of communication research at IBM Corporate Head- quarters. T HE PURPOSE of this study is to examine popular beliefs and attitudes about one of the prime symbols of our rapidly changing technology-the electronic computer. First we will focus on what computers mean to people. We shall then try to account for certain major variations in these attitudes and beliefs. METHOD During the exploratory phase of this research, one hundred intensive interviews were conducted with a diverse general public sample. In addition, a psychological analysis was made of the humor in over two hundred computer cartoons that had appeared in various popular magazines. Out of this preliminary work, concepts and hypotheses were formulated to be tested in a large-scale survey of the general population. The exploratory phase also led to the construction of 2o questionnaire statements designed to tap major themes, beliefs, and ideas about computers that exist in the culture. * The author wishes to acknowledge his gratitude to Dr. Molly Harrower for the provocative insights which stimulated the general direction of this research, and to Dr. Jacob Cohen of New York University for his invaluable comments and criticisms during analysis. Early versions of this paper were delivered at the sgth Annual Conference of AAPOR held at Excelsior Springs in May, 1964 and at the annual convention of the American Sociological Association held in Montreal in September of that year.</page><page sequence="2">54 ROBERT S. LEE The final interview schedule covered a wide variety of topics such as familiarity with computers, the 2o belief-attitude statements, various potentially relevant psychosocial attitude scale items, and the usual demographic questions. Data were collected in May, 1963 on a modi- fied area probability sample of 3,000 persons 18 years of age and older. THE STRUCTURE OF POPULAR BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES To reveal the structure of attitudes and beliefs about computers as measured by reactions to the 2o statements, a correlation matrix was computed and factor analyzed using the Varimax rotation procedure. Two factors emerged. One of these, Factor J, is clearly favorable in character. As we can see from Table 1, this factor is identified by such items as "They make it possible to speed up scientific progress and achievements," "They are important to our man-in-space pro- gram," and "They are becoming necessary to the efficient operation of large business companies." The second factor picks up most of the negative items-"They are going too far with these machines," "There is something strange and frightening about them," "They help to create unemployment"-and others of this character. At first glance, it is tempting to label these factors as "positive" and "negative" and let it go at that. A closer examination, however, shows that this is a totally inadequate formulation and would not do justice to the data. A careful inspection of Factor I shows that it does not center on any one application or function of computers. Also, we find two items which are not clearly evaluative in character: "They work at lightning speed," and "They are extremely accurate and exact." In light of this, it appears that Factor I involves more than sheer affect. It is a positively toned set of beliefs infused with the notion that computers are beneficial instruments for man's purposes-helpful in science, industry, space exploration, and so forth. Similarly, we cannot sum up Factor II adequately by merely calling it "the negative factor." One reason for this is that two patently nega- tive items (Nos. 6 and 12) simply do not load strongly on the factor, and one item which reflects awe rather than negative attitude does load heavily on the factor: "They are so amazing that they stagger your imagination." Furthermore, if we consider factor loadings of .30 and above, there is an extremely wide range of discrimination-from .39 to .62. This sharp differentiation of items clarifies the meaning of the factor and shows that it reflects particular cognitive elements rather than sheer negative affect.</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND THE COMPUTER 55 TABLE 1 THE STRUCTURE OF BELIEFS ABOUT COMPUTERS Factor Loadings Items I II I.

This is reacted to as a downgrading of humans-factor</page><page sequence="4">56 ROBERT S. LEE loadings are particularly high for items expressing a sense of personal inferiority in relation to the abilities of computers (e.g. Nos. 4 and 8). It should be pointed out that this anthropomorphic conception of the computer is clearly not the dominant one in popular thinking- at least at the conscious level as expressed in a survey interview. Typi- cally, only a minority subscribes to the various statements which characterize Factor II, in contrast to the vast majorities who readily agree with the Factor I statements that portray the computer as a beneficial tool of man. Further analysis shows that the two factors are virtually independent of each other-the correlation of index scores based on these factors is -.02. Factor II therefore appears to be an independent counter- theme in popular thought. It co-exists in the culture along with the more conventional and accepted view that sees the computer as a progressive and welcome development. It is, however, a highly sym- bolic and disquieting undercurrent of great emotional significance centering on the notion that the machine is autonomous and that it "thinks" as humans do. It has been said that the scientific revolution has resulted in a number of assaults on man's egocentric conception of himself. Coper- nicus showed that our world is not the center of the universe, Darwin showed that man is part of the same evolutionary stream as animals, and Freud showed that man is not fully the master of his own mind. The findings of this study indicate that the emergence of electronic computers may be another such challenge to man's self-concept. ACCOUNTING FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION Given the prevailing pattern just described, how is it that some people strongly resonate to the computer as a beneficial tool? And why is it that certain individuals are more likely than others to view the computer as an awesome thinking machine? To explore this issue, in addition to the usual demographic questions we also included in the questionnaire six potentially relevant psychosocial attitude scales: familiarity with the world of business, interest in current affairs, receptivity to the new and different, intolerance of uncertainties and ambiguities, trustful optimism, and alienation.' Before examining the role of psychosocial attitudes, let us first look 1 For a more detailed description of the first four scales, see the author's chapter in The Corporation and Its Publics, edited by J. W. Riley, New York, Wiley, 1963. The last two indices are shortened versions of scales developed by E. L. Streuning and A. H. Richardson, who kindly gave pre-publication permission for their use in this study. These scales are described fully in their article "A Factor Analytic Exploration of the Alienation, Anomia, and Authoritarian Domain," American Sociological Review, Vol. 3o, 1965, pp. 768-776.</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND THE COMPUTER 57 at the demographic data to determine which segments of the popula- tion are highest on Index II, our measure of the science-fiction view of the computer as an awesome thinking machine. As we might expect, this perspective of computers is strongest in those segments of the population characterized by low income, low occupational level, and poor education.2 Table 2 shows that the proportion classified as "high" TABLE 2 AWESOME THINKING MACHINE PERSPECTIVE BY EDUCATION Per cent Higha Education on Index II College (971)0 24%b High school completed (985)e 36 b High school not completed (974)0 44 b a Individuals in the upper third of the total sample distribution are classified as "high" in this and the following tables. b Based on the 71% of the sample that had heard of electronic computers prior to the interview. All subsequent tables also are based on this subsample. c For this, as well as for all other tables, the figures in parentheses refer to the base number of IBM cards rather than to the number of individuals interviewed. The number of cards exceeds the number of cases in the sample as a result of a mechanical weighting procedure used to correct for disproportionate sampling in different geographic areas. To estimate the number of actual interviews represented by a given number of cards, multiply the figure in parentheses by .776. on this perspective is nearly twice as great among people who have not completed high school in contrast to those who have attended college.3 This is a typical social science finding-our most potent indepen- dent variables in any study are generally social class indicators, parti- cularly education. By itself, however, the finding has only limited and descriptive significance; as yet we do not know why it is that people vary on this factor. We need to know more specifically what there is about education or its many important correlates that dynamically accounts for the relationship. Is there less anxiety about computers because of greater knowledge, income, personal security, intelligence, or what? Multiple regression analysis helps to throw light on this question. As shown in Table 3, two psychosocial variables-alienation and intolerance of ambiguity-show the highest zero-order correlations with Index II. Using these two variables as well as education and 2 Other demographic variables such as sex, age, and race also have statistically significant but quite unsubstantial correlations with Index II. 3 The relationship shown in Table 2 corresponds to a correlation of -.25 be- tween Index II and education.</page><page sequence="6">58 ROBERT S. LEE four other promising predictors, we obtain a multiple-r of .5o-this means that 25 per cent of the variance of Index II is accounted for by the predictor set. If we now drop out all predictor variables except alienation and intolerance of uncertainties and ambiguities-and this includes the dropping out of both sex and education-our multiple- r becomes .48, which accounts for 23 per cent of the variance. In other words, we get virtually the equivalent of our maximal prediction on the basis of these two psychosocial variables alone.

The corresponding coefficient for the 1% level is .08. The partial r's in this table show the correlation of each indicator with Index II, holding constant all the remaining indicators. This finding suggests that one of the functions of higher education is to increase ability of the individual to deal comfortably with ambi- guities and uncertainties. Partial regression analysis reveals this from another point of view. As seen in Table 3, the correlation of education and Index II is -.25. If we hold all other variables constant, the cor- relation with education drops to -.05. In effect, we have wiped out the predictive contribution of education-we have fully accounted for its relationship to Index II, and in more dynamically meaningful terms.4 CONCEPTUAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS Quite apart from what we have learned about how the public looks at computers, some of the findings of this study have conceptual 4A parallel analysis that will not be documented here was conducted for the beneficial tool of man perspective represented by Index I. The results indicate that this view of computers is fostered by (1) an over-all cognitive receptivity and curio- sity about the new and different, (2) an attitude of generalized trust and optimism about people and social institutions, (3) a curiosity about mechanical things, and (4) familiarity with the world of business. Partial correlation analysis shows that each of these findings is independent of the others and of the various demographic variables investigated.</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND THE COMPUTER 59 and theoretical implications of a more general nature about the process of opinion formation on public issues. In the case of the computer, we have seen that popular reaction to this development is organized around two basic ideas-that the com- puter is a beneficial tool of man, and that it may be a superhuman thinking machine that downgrades man's previously unique signif- icance in the order of things. The lack of correlation between these two views of the computer implies that we would have been seriously misled if we had used a simple pro-con attitude scale of the kind usually employed in public opinion polls. This suggests that while pro-con attitude measurement might be appropriate for the limited task of assessing how the public might vote for a particular candidate or a particular course of action, it is methodologically inadequate if we want to understand the structure of beliefs and values involved in popular perceptions of a salient social issue or development. The study also indicates that the conceptual distinction between affect and cognition does not mean that these are distinct empirically. In this case, we have found that what people think is true about com- puters, what they think this means for the future, and how they feel about these things are all dynamically and intimately organized around two major belief-attitude-value systems. This suggests that future public opinion research studies might profitably search for similar belief-attitude-value systems in other areas of interest such as race relations, foreign affairs, welfare policy, the role of government, etc. The findings of this study suggest that the computer as an object of social perception functions to a certain degree as a Rorschach blot or TAT card. It is a complex and ambiguous stimulus-how individuals perceive it and give meaning to it depends very much on their funda- mental values, on their personality dynamics, and on their basic orientations toward life. It is unlikely that the computer is unique in this respect; the same psychological phenomenon may be quite wide- spread in the response of people to many other developments and issues in the world of public affairs.5 5 For evidence on the importance of personality and psychodynamic factors as determinants of opinion on a social issue, see M.
