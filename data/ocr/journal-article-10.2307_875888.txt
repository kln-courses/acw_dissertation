By Ronald Alley. 2opp. +7 ills. in text. 48th Charlton Lecture. (University of Newcastle upon Tyne.) The Sculpture of Picasso contains excellent illustrations of all the works seen in the exhibitions at London and New York in I967 and will thus be valuable as a work of reference. Sir Roland Penrose's intro- ductory essay to the Tate Gallery cata- logue is here reproduced in an enlarged form, and succeeds both in concentrating the reader's attention on the successive important phases of Picasso's career as a sculptor, and in adumbrating the particu- lar artistic problems raised by each of these. The most controversial works are undoubtedly those relating to the cubist period in painting, and those of the late 1920s and early 1930s, beginning with the 'Metamorphosis' of 1928. Sir Roland is right to stress the importance of 'Paradox and Dialectical Opposition' in the con- text of the latter work. Perhaps it is these very qualities which should be seen as fundamental also to the sculptures of the earlier phase, not only the Woman's Head of 1909, but also to the 'Constructions' of 1912-1916. For the creation of a cubist sculpture can be considered not so much a tautology as a contradiction of the achievements of that style in painting. It is because a painting is, in Denis's words, 'Une surface plane recouverte de couleurs en un certain ordre assembldes' that space and volume can be treated as they are in cubist painting. Picasso's attempts to develop this style in three dimensions smack of a deliberate, anarchic iconoclasm, and the paradox lies in the fact that the icons are themselves of his own making. If cubist painting is 'conceptual' it is because it deals of three dimensions in terms of two. Picasso's de- light in paradox leads to the making of three-dimensional works sharing the stylis- tic peculiarities proper to works in two dimensions. In a sense, cubist sculpture lacks a raison d'itre. Hence the fact that the 'Constructions' lack the imaginative appeal of the synthetic cubist paintings which underlie them. 'Le Tableau-Objet' is 161</page><page sequence="2">THE LITERATURE OF ART a meaningful expression. 'L'Objet-Objet' might be coined as its corollary to em- brace the 'constructions', and its deliberate absurdity is a valid reflection of Picasso's creative method. Whether all of Picasso's later sculpture will continue in its present high esteem it is not part of Sir Roland's task to deter- mine. But while he convinces us of the great value of many works including the Man with Sheep of I944, the Death's Head of the same year and the Flowers in a Vase of I953, the ceramics and sheet-iron sculptures still await their Evangelist. Until then we may at least share Sir Roland's delight in their ingenuity and charm. The acquisition of Picasso's The Three Dancers of 1925 for the Tate Gallery was also largely due to the good offices of Sir Roland Penrose. The painting is an im- portant milestone in Picasso's career, and a virtue of Ronald Alley's Charlton lecture is the demonstration that in synthesizing aspects of late synthetic cubism and the 'neo-Classicism' of the previous years Picasso created a prophetic masterpiece which was instantly seized on by the Surrealists who claimed to recognize therein an affinity with their own inten- tions. On the whole this affinity was more imagined than real; this discussion implies as much in its generally convincing analysis of the painting in terms of visual and emotional precedents. For this is not only a prophetic, but also a retrospective work in which, according to Mr Alley, we can detect a chain of associations reaching backwards in time from the death of Picasso's friend Ramon Pichot in 1925, to the death of another friend, Carlos Casagemas, in I1901. Mr Alley is justified in adopting this approach by Picasso's own statement to the effect that the grey profile behind the right-hand dancer is 'the presence of Pichot'. This remark is among those re- corded by Sir Roland Penrose in the Tate Gallery Annual Report for 1964-1965. In the same conversation Picasso compared The Three Dancers with Guernica, speaking of the former as 'More a real painting - a painting in itself without any outside considerations'. While one might see here a caveat against the type of exegesis which Mr Alley here attempts, it is more prob- ably correct, in the context, to assume that a contrast between the more ex- plicitly propagandist nature of Guernica and the purely personal significance of The Three Dancers was intended by Picasso. Mr Alley's argument, which amplifies Lawrence Gowing's discussion of the painting in the Tate Gallery Report thus assumes considerable importance in that it helps us to see The Three Dancers as a less isolated work than it has previously appeared. Not only can it be related stylistically to the works of the immediately preceding years, but it can now also be seen as comparable, in terms of content, with such works as The Burial of Casagemas of 190I or La Vie of I903. Possibly the increasing tension visible in the paintings of the later I92os, of which The Three Dancers is the chief precursor, may also be open to reappraisal. The Three Dancers is not likely yet to have yielded up all its secrets. In the present context two additional facts may be worth mentioning: the suggestion that the paint- ing hints at a Crucifixion, while of the greatest interest, does not find confirma- tion in the apparent paraphrase of the figure-group in the patterning of the wall- paper. That this paraphrase is intentional seems to be confirmed, however, by the existence of a group of anthropomorphic pen-drawings of the preceding year (Zervos V. 342-7) which clearly fore- shadow this pattern. If the crucifixion analogy can be said to exist, then there is additional support for Mr Alley's thesis that 'The Three Dancers was begun as a straightforward representation of the dance ... and that after Pichot's death, it took on various deeper meanings'. Secondly, the profile 'presence of Pichot' recurs in another work of the same year, La Statuaire (Z.V.45I). The comparison seems to illustrate how Picasso, as creator of his own iconography, enjoys the freedom to vary its significance. Not only his forms, but also his ideas, in fact, are 'metamor- phic'.
