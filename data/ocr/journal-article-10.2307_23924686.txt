Cambridge; Cambridge University Press, 1990. xvi+ 456 pp. £35-00/$54.50. Michael Wheeler, who is Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University, has, in this study of the major eschatological themes in Victorian literature and theology, provided us with an illuminating, perceptive and sensitive work of scholarship, a model of the interplay between theological and literary study. His publishers have complemented his scholarship with book production of the highest quality. The theological literature of the nineteenth century concerned with the traditional 'four last things'—death, judgement, heaven and hell—is vast in proportion and varied in character. Tracts, sermons, hymns, the litera re of theological disputation about eternal punishment, evolutionary theory and the immortality of the soul, cremation, cemeteries and churchyards; funeral monuments, mourning accoutre ments and biblical commentaries, not to mention devotional works for the consola tion of the bereaved and edifying accounts of death-beds. No one can hope to encompass the whole range of this literature and Michael Wheeler has wisely opted, after a preliminary chapter concerned with the question of biblical authority and the question of analogy and the limits of language, to devote the first half of his book to a structured explication of the way in which the great eschatological themes were handled in theological controversy, hymnody, and particularly in the great eschatological epics, Robert Pollok's Course of Time (1857) and Edward Bickersteth's Yesterday, To-Day and For Ever (1866). The second half of the book explores four major literary texts in the light of this more general discussion— Tennyson's In Memoriam, Dickens' Our Mutual Friend; Newman's Dream of Gerontius (a discussion which includes an analysis of significant aspects of Elgar's oratorio enabling the different theological resonances of the text as set to music and New man's longer original poem to be drawn out); and Hopkins' Wreck of the Deutschland. Eighteen carefully chosen illustrations allow for some contribution from the nine teenth-century visual arts, which would alone provide material for another major study on the same theme. The two immense canvases by John Martin, The Last fudgement, portraying the train with carriages marked Paris, Kansas and Rome falling into the abyss, surveyed by the saved, and The Plains of Heaven, once described to the present reviewer by its previous owner as 'a Turner with figures', are the artistic equivalent of the eschatological epics. Wheeler deftly analyses the tension in both Victorian theology and literature between heaven as the place of reunion, and heaven as the beatific vision or as participation in God. 'On the resurrection morning soul and body meet again', Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">390 BOOK REVIEWS and on that day, 'what knitting of severed friendships up.' Charles Kingsley's erotic sketch of himself and Fanny ascending to heaven would have been a further instance to illustrate the theme of the Romantic heaven of erotic reunion. The imaginative evocation of heaven, hell and the Last Day, draws on the symbolic universe of scripture, and Wheeler is alert to the complexities of that universe, its unresolved time sequences, and the tensile character of eschatology— the 'already' overlapping with the 'not yet'. He reminds us, particularly in his discussion of the Wreck of the Deutschland of the shaping of Hopkins' imagination through the disciplines of Ignatian spirituality, which in one respect are but an instance of the more general Christian incorporation of the world into biblical narrative. What Wheeler calls 'the locutionary present' is a characteristic of much hymnody in which the future reality of heaven becomes present for the worshipper in what Eliade would call the illud tempus of liturgical time, the Divine kairos of crucifixion and resurrection intersecting with and transfiguring the chronos in which the worshipper exists and which moves towards death and judgement. In one of the stanzas of Gerontius which Elgar did not include in his oratorio the soul of Gerontius perplexed by his disembodied yet still anthropomorphic existence is told by the angel that he is 'wrapp'd and swath'd around in dreams / Dreams that are true, yet enigmaf al; / For the belongings of thy present state, / Save through such symbols, come ot home to thee.' These true, yet enigmatical dreams, with their power to evoke the sense of an Ending, an ultimate hope and a final judgement, giving meaning and purpose to lives that end in death and dissolution, are the substantive symbolism of Christian theology, itself a re-casting of a story of exodus, exile and redemption, in the narrow focus of a single life in which those themes are decisively re-enacted and universalised. In Newman and Hopkins, and in a different mode in Tennyson, the Christian hope is embodied and expressed. Pusey, Newman's fellow Tractarian, the doctor mysticus of the Oxford Movement, could likewise write eloquently of the hope of heaven, of the Glory filling the Elect 'above the brightness of the sun,' making them 'transparent with light, all bright, all pure; and that with the imparted light of God. And what should I more say? God is Love.' If this reviewer has a regret it is that Pusey's sermons on heaven did not find a place in Professor Wheeler's work. But that is a minor cavil in respect of so searching and sensitive a study. GEOFFREY ROWELL Keble College, Oxford</page></plain_text>
