<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE YEAR OF THE BUTTERFLY, by George Ordish. 1975. Charles Scrib- ner's Sons (597 Fifth Ave., New York 10017). 148 p. $8.95 hardback. The saga of two monarch butter- flies-from egg to caterpillar to mating adults and over a 6,000-mile migration, including the attempted return journey home-is related in scholarly detail in this book. Ordish, an economic ento- mologist, launches Pliable and Timor- ous (female and male characters from Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress) on their lepidopteron adventure by describing their activities on emerging from their minute (20/1,000 inch diameter) eggs laid in a milkweed patch beside a fill- ing station in Glens Falls, N.Y. From that point on the story unfolds in abundant biological detail, instar by instar, stage by stage. The drama is told occasionally from the perspective of the filling station operator's son and his entomologist companion, but mostly from the imagined viewpoint of Pliable and Timorous. There are adventures galore: the task, as recently emerged caterpillars, of remaining in contact with their specific food plant while en- during storms, resisting attack by pred- ators, avoiding or fighting off parasitic flies, and ultimately the arduous mi- gration to Mexico and back. There is, for the general reader, a healthy and digestible dose of sound bi- ology throughout this book. Ordish fre- quently interjects informative tidbits that exemplify and amplify basic beha- vioral adaptations operative at the va- rious stages of the monarch's life cycle and several physiological and environ- mental factors that release the behavior. Ordish is at his best when he tempo- rarily strays from his story-line butter- fly personalities and attends to the bio- logical business at hand; for instance, the passage dealing with the mon- arch's abilities to navigate vast dis- tances over water and varied terrain is excellent. But some readers will want more information on the significance and techniques of tagging butterflies. The fact that they can be tagged at all will surprise many. Any beginning student of butterfly behavior will benefit by reading this at- tractive little book. Unfortunately, how- ever, the more serious student is likely to object to the numerous cases of an- thropomorphism and teleology, both of which are difficult to avoid in a narra- tive of this sort. Sample instances: At the outset we are told that the "... ani- mals are the enemies of plants. They eat them. Plants fight back." "Enemy" is used all too frequently and inter- changably with "predator." We are told that Exorista (a parasitic fly whose grub bores into caterpillars and feeds on them) ".... would feed extremely care- fully, to avoid killing its host prematurely." Ordish himself warns of the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in nature writing and even includes a brief essay about it in the appendix, al- though he fails to come to grips with the subject critically. The effect of an- thropomorphism is, of course, to m-ake the reader identify with the nonhuman animal cast in a "hero" role. More sound science might have gotten across had the reader been made to identify with the two young researchers who so methodically traced the four-month ac- tivities of Pliable and Timorous. After all, it is the human perspective from which we must inevitably view the world. Until we achieve the skill-i.e., scientific observation and objective de- scription-required to observe that world dispassionately we surely are to be misled, and to mislead, if we at- tempt to describe the world from the perspective of a nonhuman animal to which we attribute human passions. As appendix items, the book includes reference notes, a chronology of the life history of both butterflies under study, a brief glossary, bibliography, and in- dex. Typographically attractive, the book would have been improved signif- icantly by including informative photo- graphs, and diagrams by a skilled entomological illustrator. The nine ma- jor drawings are poorly done and tend to be more decorative than informative; in three cases they are at odds with the text. More attention to illustrations, which would have justified the high price of this book, and diligent editing to avoid anthropomorphisms would have gone a long way to make this good book emerge into an excellent one.
