C. xxiv + 320 pp. $6.50.-Praise be to the Wild- life Society for printing the price of the book on the copyright page, thus protect- ing from inflation (maybe). This is the Society that publishes the Journal of Wildlife Management, and the book is a "how to win friends" text. Included are instructions on using mass communications, advertising, propaganda, dealing with governmental officials, group motivation, how to present slide shows, and so on. The end of the volume gives some interesting case histories in public re- lations, including the famous 1967 elk controversy in Yellowstone National Park. Although the situation is anything but simple, part of it involved whether the abundant elk would be driven out of the Park to be taken by hunters or cropped inside the Park by the Park Service. The author's bias shows clearly in his com- ments, such as "Very little controversy exists over whether or not a reduction is necessary. As for letting nature take its course, it has been pointed out by the Leopold Report that management is necessary. . ." (p. 234). I'm not sure every- one would agree, since the apparent overpopulation of the elk that would destroy the habitat has been in part due to the shortage of original predators, such as wolves and pumas, and in turning the grizzly bears to dumps for their food. Fortunately, a new Park Service policy seems to be shaping now (as opposed to the 1967 controversy related here) in which biologists are questioning whether a reduction in elk is necessary. For too long, it seems to me, National Parks have failed to meet their goal of preserving intact ecosystems because of undue influence of wildlife management attitudes. The propogation of wildlife for hunting is a different matter, carrying different attitudes and orientations than those associated with preserving natural communities. Although some management is bound to be required in order to get our National Parks back into balance before they can be allowed to "run free" ecologically, there is only one animal that really needs to be managed closely on a perpetual basis: Homo sapiens. This book might prove surprisingly valuable for the true conservation buff, since cowboy-ecology industry and govern- mental bureaucracy are not the only enemies of the natural environment.-Jack P. Hailman. 80. Aftercare of Oil-covered Birds. J. L. Naviaux. 1971. National Wildlife Health Foundation. San Francisco, Calif. Mimeographed, with plastic back and paper covers. 33 pp. Available by gift &amp; exchange.-This is published preliminary to a future book: Oiled Seabirds: Contingency Program for After- care and Treatment, T. T. Crowell Co., New York. The conservation crisis-con- servationists must meet the challenge: this was approximately the title of the talk of one of the perennial leaders of wildlife foundations at the last "Wildlife Con- ference" in Washington. This work represents the efforts of a group which would meet head-on the problem of high mortality of oil-stricken seabirds, the mortality of which is unbelievably and disastrously high. The crucial point research-wise is that "Little is known about the pathological effects of most petroleum oils. The heavier crude oils appear to be less toxic than the lighter volatile oils which con- tain many aromatics." Light oil spills (e.g., of kerosenes) bring the highest death rates, and that in less than 36 hours. Of the commonest mortal symptoms, respira- tory distress and diarrhea, subsequent autopsies show very little evidence of either. Although birds are extraordinarily able to dispose of internal food poisons, e.g., arsenic and atropine, poisons externally applied are a much more lethal problem; thus more knowledge and research is needed on avian dermal physiology. In terse telegraphic style, experience-gained practical information is given on numerous topics including the following: general contamination effects; cleaning and recovery measures; medical treatment, which must include dealing with incidental wounds and fractures; release procedures, record-keeping of pro- cedures; equipment and readiness of personnel (especially imperative for large disasters). "It must be recognized that these birds are medical cases and must be treated individually as such."-Leon Kelso. 81. Vertebrate Animals and their Urbanization in Poltava City and Vcnt.

(In Russian.)-As more and more of the humanly habitable world becomes urbanized the capacity of birds to adapt thereto</page><page sequence="2">78]j Recent Literature Bird-Banding January, 1972 becomes more consequential, at least to the birds. In the about 70 pages devoted to the 154 species discussed here, it is evident that as in other areas, some species have retreated from urban life whereas others have adapted to and even flourished in it. Here, based on 60 years of observations, the breeding species, including two falcons and two owls, number 41: migrants, 118; winter residents, 49; permanent residents, 12; and irregular visitors, 10.-Leon Kelso. 82. Mimicry in Plants and Animals. Wolfgang Wickler. 1968. World University Library, London. 255 pp. $2.45, paperback. (Translated from the German by R. D. Martin.)-Mimicry can be loosely defined as the evolution of a morphological or behavioral pattern that resembles the pattern of another organ- ism or thing. It is often brought about by realizing gain through confusing some third organism. The classical case, of course, is that of certain tasty (to birds) butterflies that have come to resemble certain distasteful butterflies, and are thus avoided by the avian predator. However, Wickler leads us through a world of all kinds of other mimicry in all kinds of animals, some examples being so fantastic that they are difficult to believe. This is an exciting book of scientific exploration into natural history, delivered in an excellent translation and sprinkled with fas- cinating pictures, many of which are in color. At this bargain price the book should be in the collection of anyone who has even a passing interest in wild things. -Jack P. Hailman. 83. Numerical Taxonomy. A. J. Cole, editor. 1969.

The Bases of Automatic Classifcation. (Les bases de la classifica- tion automatique.) I. C. Lerman. 1970. Gauthier-Villars, Paris. viii + 117 pp. (In French).-The details and philosophies of the three systems noted above, as well as those long being developed in this country (embodied mostly in the books and articles of Sneath and Sokal) involve bird systematics, there being so much available data oIn them, and provide abundant details for those who can or care to read them. They are indicative of the invasion of biology by the prac- titioners of mathematical science. Chemists and physicists are likewise exploiting it as evidenced by many articles of bird interest appearing in their journals.- Leon Kelso. 86. Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story. Richard Bach. 1970. Macmillian, N. Y. 93 pp. $4.95.-There are two kinds of anthropomorphism, I've decided: one kind uses us, as we think we are, to explain animals that we don't understand; the other uses animals to understand ourselves better. Jonathan wanted to fly well: "Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgrace and it is dishonor." To compare Richard Bach with Poe is unduly strained, but there are touches of prose that do border on poetry. The story, such as it is, I must leave for you, with only the note that Russell Munson's fine photographic studies in black-and-white in no way detract from this surprisingly delightful little book.-Jack P. Hailman. SPECIAL REVIEW ON "PETERSON" FIELD GUIDES 87. A Field Guide to the Insects of America North of Mexico. Donald J. Borror and Richard E. White. 1970. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. x + 404 pp. $5.95.-The ornithologist's reaction might well be "it's high time someone wrote a field guide to bird food." Field Guide no. 19 of the "Peterson"} series is destined to wind up in the library of most of us interested in avian ecology as well as the pockets of those who merely love creepy-crawly things. And yes, this is the same Borror whose fine work on bird song is well known. Whereas the ultimate proof of a field guide is in the using, this one has all the earmarks of being a truly fine one. Used properly, it should allow the rankest of amateurs to identify any American insect to family. What? Not to species? Well, consider the magnitude of the problem: for every bird species there are more than</page></plain_text>
