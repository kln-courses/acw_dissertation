<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sex Differentiation and Infant Care: A Rejoinder to Sharlotte Neely Williams PIERRE L. VAN DEN BERGHE University of Washington Williams' recent note (1971) is invalid on four counts. First, she generalizes from a single highly atypical great ape species to primates in general. Second, she claims that infant care is a better predictor of adult primate behavior than sex. Third, she mis- takenly believes that she is arguing against physiological determination of primate behavior. Fourth, she attributes to Brown (1970) a position which Brown never adopted. Williams' statement that she cited "merely ... three of many examples from 770</page><page sequence="2">DISCUSSION AND DEBATE 771 primatology" is untenable. She reported the concurring findings of three observers of three different groups of chimpanzees. Until such time as we can establish that we can meaningfully talk of each chimpanzee group having its own "culture," we must treat the species as the unit of behavioral analysis, not the group. To treat three chimpanzee groups as three cases from a simian counterpart of the Ethnographic Atlas is a blatant piece of anthropomorphism. The great apes have, of course, the rudiments of "culture," but the intra-specific similarities of behavior are far more striking than the differences. It does indeed seem that chimpanzees have clearly differentiated "nursery groups" of adult females and their infants, and "sexual groups" composed of adults and juveniles of both sexes. Kortlandt (1962) rightly reports this as a striking and unique finding: "To my knowledge there is no other primate-indeed no other mammal among which the chief social distinction is between children and child-rearing adults rather than between males and females." Williams dis- misses that conclusion, but is unable to produce examples from other species, merely claiming that there are many such. The chimpanzee (along with the gibbon, or at least with the best known species thereof, Hylobates lar) is one of the least dominance-ordered, and sexually dimorphic of the higher primates. Chimpanzees, it seems, successfully achieve what Homo sapiens radicals only dream of: peaceful, non-competitive, non-coercive, non-possessive, egalitarian, jealousy-free, promiscuous, non-tyrannical communes. Gibbons, by contrast, live in very "straight," monogamous, exogamous, nuclear families (if I may now be permitted the anthro- pomorphism), but they also have virtually no male dominance or sexual dimorphism. Gibbons and chimpanzees, however, are exceptions. Most higher primates, and particularly the terrestrial ones, such as macaques and baboons, are highly dimorphic and sex-role differentiated, and a good many are organized in ferocious male tyrannies. Kummer's (1968) superb monograph on Papio hamadryas, the prolific work of De Vore and Washburn on other baboons, and that done at the Japanese Monkey Center on Macaca fuscata are all cases in point. In a given species, a female may be treated quite differently by, say, adult males, depending on whether she is adult or sub-adult, in oestrus or anoestrus, nursing an infant or not. But to suggest that the infant-free adult female and the adult male behave in similar ways and that infant care is a better predictor of role differentiation than sex, flies in the face of nearly all we know about primates, human or sub-human. Even if Williams' thesis were correct, however, it is not at all clear in what way it would argue against physiological determina- tion of female roles as she suggests. Indeed, what is the most irreducibly physiological basis of being a mammalian female than gestating and lactating the young, a problem compounded in higher primates by pro- longed infant dependency? Williams' note is also interesting in that it attributes to Brown (1970) a position which Brown never took. Brown merely says: since women are everywhere expected to do most of the infant raising, the importance of women in the system of production is a function of the extent to which productive activities are compatible with infant care. Brown is not arguing against physiological determination of sex roles. She merely suggests that the specific activities of women vary enormously from one society to an- other except that women nearly always get stuck with the children, and thus cannot very well wage war, go hunting, herd live- stock, or engage in an agricultural tech- nology involving the use of draft animals. The argument simply boils down to saying: the physiological basis for the sexual division of labor is obvious, but it is grossly insuf- ficient to explain its specific modalities in concrete cases. For that purpose, we need to introduce technology and other factors as important causal variables. Equally interesting is the article by Ember and Ember (1971) which is, in a sense, the mirror image of Brown's. The</page><page sequence="3">772 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [74, 1972 Embers start from the opposite tack of accounting for the role of men in the productive process and conclude that since war (in the broad sense of institutionalized lethal violence) is a male prerogative, men will work productively wherever war does not chronically interfere with productive activities. The two arguments thus dovetail: men do the killing and women the child bearing and rearing, a division of labor rooted in physiology. Either sex only does such productive labor as does not interfere with the activity at which the other sex is inept. Instead of this sensible formulation, Williams suggests that whether an adult of either sex is encumbered by children or not is a better predictor of what it will do than its sex. This is plainly untrue for practically all primates, with the partial exception of the chimpanzee. Among humans, there are a number of societies where, to be sure, females below and beyond child-bearing age are subjected to less sex-differentiated roles than the fecund ones. Indeed, fecundity is often the most fundamental social attribute of full womanhood; but its absence, far from identifying women to the status of men in their respective societies, is typically stig- matized. In a few societies, young childless women take an auxiliary role in warfare (Dahomeyan amazons, Viet Cong guerillas, Israeli army), but the social role of adult women is overwhelmingly more determined by sex than by infant-dependency status. Of course, the role of women is potently determined by age as well as sex, but this is equally true of men, and has nothing to do with child care. Many further conditions, some physiological (menstruation, preg- nancy, lactation), others social (class, marital status), make up the social definition of an individual woman's role, and these include whether she has dependent children. How- ever, the overwhelming salience and univer- sality of both age and sex differentiation among human and sub-human primates is glaring. In humans, both forms of differ- entiation have been the object of much social elaboration, but to dismiss either their importance or their partially physiological basis is an ideological, not an empirical, statement. Hopefully, we can correct the male bias of so much anthropology without creating a new brand of nonsense. References Cited Brown, Judith K. 1970 A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex.
