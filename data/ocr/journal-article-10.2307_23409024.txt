<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yengo Country: Some Ancient Sandstone Art in South-Eastern Australia Paul Gordon, Peter Crousen and Garry Jones Co-leaders of the Binghai (Brother) Aboriginal Sites Team Department of Fine Art, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales1 when aboriginal art is mentioned today most people probably bring to mind images of those elab orate and finely patterned bark paintings from the Northern Territory or those equally engaging rich dot paintings from the Central Desert regions. So influential have been such images in recent years that they now tend to dominate the world-wide view of what constitutes "Aboriginality." The spiritual dimensions underlying this well-known art now also seem to be applied broadly to the tribal cultures throughout Australia. But the ancient beliefs and image-making of the South-Eastern tribes, includ ing those living in the sandstone country of Central-Eastern New South Wales, remain signifi cantly different. By and large, they have also been neglected ing nourished throughout and that reciprocal visits between tribes were commonplace. Just how the trading network operated is not easy to determine precisely, but its basic features can be deduced through considering the likely positioning of the tribal lands involved. A qualification needs to be added here; namely, for these people the notion of a tribal "boundary" usually had a quite different meaning from that we might normally apply to it. For, as with tribes throughout Australia—and prob ably elsewhere as well—the peoples of the sandstone country were constantly moving throughout their respective lands, the boundaries of which were thus continually expanding and contracting. The causes of such "pulsations" are well-acknowledged: season ally-based cycles in the weather, food and water sup plies, foliage growth, and combustibility, etc. Gooris (Aboriginal people) have lived in and around the sandstone country for at least 20,000 years.2 Tribal lore says that they have done so since time began, since Byamee (read "God Almighty" in Western terms) oversaw the land's creation and the Dreamtime coming of all things living, including humankind. Thinking oï the tribal areas in such a "fluid fash ion helps confirm something we already know of the approximate walking routes forming the old trade and communications network. For such routes roughly follow the zones where tribal boundaries would have overlapped, zones which, when con nected, provide long meandering lines of passage across the sandstone country and, no doubt, far beyond as well. We know that the sandstone country was home to a large tribal population in 1788, when the first European settlement was established at Sydney Cove. It was—and still is for the people living here—a very resource-rich country, from the seashores and inlets to the broad rivers and estuarie, to the extensive creek systems dissecting the dense ly-timbered and rugged ridges of the eroded sand stone plateau. Foodstuffs were therefore varied and plentiful. At regular points we find what could be called "tri-lingual" places where three neighboring tribes met. Such places were the likely vital transmission points for inter-tribal communications and the probable centers for large tribal gatherings. The indi viduals living in and around these places for most of their lives would undoubtedly have spoken the three languages (and there are cases on record of Gooris who were fluent in twice as many!) and their famil ial, clan-based and totemic ties would have gone beyond their actual tribal affiliations. Such a mesh ing of bloodlines, languages, and traditions in these places would thus have helped stabilize inter-tribal relations over many generations. Previous published accounts, dating back to the last century, tell us that a number of distinct tribes lived here: the Darginung, the Dharug, the Awabagal, the Guringai, the Wonarua, the Eora, the Gundungurra, the north-eastern clans of the Wiradjuri and the south-eastern clans or the Gamilaroi. Such accounts also report that tribal trad January 1993 43</page><page sequence="2">A case in point is the present—day township of Wollombi. Wollombi in fact means "meeting place" and, as it turns out, the depictions and stylistic fea tures of the art of the surrounding district confirm the presence there of at least three different cultural influences. Early European records (1820 onwards) tell us much the same thing. But a visitor to the sandstone country today needs to realize that the land itself has changed markedly over the past 200 years. Rivers and streams are now severely silted—up, roadways and settlement have obliterated most of the ancient walking paths and what was once a high tree-canopy has been dec imated through prolonged logging. Indeed, when reading the accounts of early white settlers and trav ellers one finds the country as described almost impossible to reconcile with what one sees today. For those accounts describe a landscape and a human abode that contradict the now widespread view that the country in question had always been frightfully inhospitable, monotonously bleak and virtually impassable. Instead, those earlier observations speak of an extensive network of well—beaten walking paths,3 of the Hawkesbury River plain having the most fertile soil in the world and able to produce two bumper-crops in a single year,4 and of the ridge and valleys to the north resembling an English garden under a towering canopy of trees.5 But impassable the country undoubtedly was for the first few decades of European colonization. It is increasingly understood today that Goori resistance to the spreading white settlers was intense and sus tained along the Hawkesbury, and probably to the north as well. The fact that it took 50 years before a small party of whites could successfully make their way from Windsor to the Hunter—a distance of only 150 km—speaks for itself. Apart from the obvious necessity to check the expansion of the European presence it is also quite GAMILAROI WIRADJURI OARGINUNG GUNDUNGURRA 50 Km. UONARUA Wollombi fU Hunter R.

After all, these people had many of their most important spiritual and teaching places preserved there: paintings, drawings, and engravings, as well as carved trees and stone arrangements. These factors are important in introducing what the authors call "Yengo Country," that north-east ern part of the sandstone country in which they have concentrated their fieldwork over the past seventeen years. While some of these important places are deep in the heart of particular tribal areas it does appear that many were visited and used by people of different tribes on a fairly regular basis. Given the shared spir itual life of the different tribes, such "incursions" are quite understandable for they would have been required by Byamees laws. The so—called "Walkabout is still today widely misunderstood by non-Aboriginal people. The term itself suggest aimless wandering around in the landscape, but nothing could be further from the truth. It actually refers to practicing a "Dream—cycle" pilgrimage in which all members of the tribe participated, and, which in the case of many people, continued for substantial portions of their lives. Because Byamee gave His people special places for the maintenance of strict religious and moral precepts it was required that these places be visited endlessly in carefully laid-down cycles to keep alive the Dreamtime (pre-Creation and Creation) and its sacred teachings. For every man, woman and child the sacred dimensions of kinship and conduct, of one's totemic relationships with the rest of Creation, of marriage and parenthood, of growing old—and wise—and death itself were all nourished and unravelled over the course of one's lifetime in the "Dream-cycle." It is this that is the very well-spring of Aboriginality, linking people and land under His gaze in a bind ing and lasting fashion. The spiritual obligations of the peoples of the sandstone country thus required them to be always moving along (and sometimes across) tribal bound aries as well as within their particular tribal lands. And, at important times, the peoples of different tribes would have had to come together for shared ceremonies. This is not to suggest that inter-tribal relations would have always been peaceful and ordered. But it does underline the precedence that spiritual obligations took over more secular con cerns, such as the protection of exclusive hunting domains, etc. For Yengo is the place in the sandstone country where Byamee stepped back into the sky after His "angels" and "archangels" had completed their Creation tasks and after He had given His laws to His people. This uniquely symmetrical and flat-topped mountain is, understandably, the key to learning the basics about the sandstone country and the ancient cultures north of the Hawkesbury River. But having said this, it must also be pointed out that Yengo is not the only place of its kind in South-Eastern Australia. We have, as other exam ples, Oombi Oombi (Mount Oxley, re-named after himselr by a white explorer last century) and Coronga (Peak) near Byrock in Western New South Wales. On the south coast we have the mountain of Mumbulla. In fact there are many high landmarks across the South—East where Byamee was present Figure 2.

Darginung engraving of a small female figure in profile with arm and hand indicating the direction of womens' country (a unique formal aspect of this figure being the clear overlapping of thigh upon trunk upon breast, a feature which contradicts the widespread view that "depth perception" is unknown in ancient tribal art). and then ascended back into the sky on His sacred journeying from tribe to tribe. It may come as a surprise to some readers to learn of such an ancient (and yet familiar) spiritual focus for the tribes of the South—East of Australia. But Byamee was well known to those who spoke direct ly to the people of these tribes during the 19th Century, and by Elkin and others this century. In more recent times scholars of the calibre of Mircea Eliade have collated and re—examined their accounts of this: ...supreme divinity among the tribes of South—East Australia...[who] dwells in the sky, beside a great stream of water (the Milky Way), and receives the souls of the inno cent...Thunder is his voice; he causes the rain to fall, making the whole earth green and fer tile...For Baiame is self-created and has creat ed everything from nothing...Baiame sees and hears everything.^ In more matter-of-fact terms, Yengo is an erod ing basalt cap, rising 300 meters above the sur rounding sandstone hills and ridges, and is visible over vast distances in all directions: from the Barrington Range north of the Hunter River, the Watagan Mountains to the east near Newcastle, the hills along the Hawkesbury to the south, the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney and from many high points along the Great Dividing Range, which arcs beyond the horizon to the west and north—west. Yengo has an unmistakable shape: a flat crown, steep slopes giving way to rounded shoulders and these, in turn, to sloping curves connecting the base to its radiating ridges. Like some mysterious and pri mordial stepped-pyramid, Yengo completely domi nates the surrounding countryside. It is little won der then that so many important Goori sites occupy this land—sacred sites and teaching sites and fami ly shelters all along the ancient pathways of pil grimage—these with panoramic views of His Figure 4. Darginung engraving of a large kangaroo with joey. 46 January 1993</page><page sequence="5">mountain: Yengo, His "stepping-up" place. The ancient weathering of the old basalt cover ing and the prolonged eroding by wind and rain of the broad sandstone plateau itself has produced a very diverse landscape. Creek and river flats remain fertile and, depending on the aspect, the ridges and spurs vary greatly: the northern and western slopes being sandy and dry with somewhat sparse vegeta tion while the southern and eastern slopes are gen erally moist and luxurious. And it is in this chang ing environment that caves and wind-swept shelter, cliffs and terraces and broad sandstone platforms abound, many of which house the art sites that have occupied us since 1976. As might be expected, the art sites of Yengo coun try are quite fragile. The sandstone deposits in which they occur are porous and soft, have a tendency to powder and crumble—especially when the lichen—covered outer layer is disturbed—and are often subject to cracking and flake-weathering. Since the majority of the sites are open to the ele ments we therefore find that rain, wind, fire, cold winters, falling trees, encroaching surface vegetation and even insect infestations all contribute to their ongoing deterioration. The present-day condition of many sites in the sandstone country, and the fact that they are hard to find, indeed some being almost inaccessible, partly explains why they seem to have been overlooked. And since so much of the imagery is faint and there fore difficult to discern many of the recording meth ods used in the past have not been able to portray adequately its richness, its beauty, or its authentic cultural power. Past surveys and reports have often been relatively thorough, but because the people doing them have usually lacked any formal art background or little first-hand experience of tribal knowledge, they have tended to focus on the more conventional archaeo logical aspects of techniques, subject tallies, stylistic classifications, etc. Since it has precisely been the artistic and cultural aspects of these sites that have engagea our interest over the year, rrom the outset, we committed ourselves to recording them as accu rately and sensitively as possible. By far the most common things we find in Yengo country are hand-stencils in the caves and shelters, bird tracks engraved on rock platforms and axe or spear grooves ground into rocky outcrops in the Figure 5. Elegant Wonarua engraving of a brush-turkey (larger than life-size), the foot forming a directional track pointing to the land of this totem's clan. creek beds. Occasionally a large cave or rock plat form will be adorned with images of people (e.g. Figs. 2- and 3), animals (e.g. Fig. 4), birds (e.g. Figs. 5 and 6), fish, reptiles, mythological creatures, anthropomorphic or totemic figures (e.g. Fig. 7), spirit-beings or "clever men" (shamanic person ages), Byamees footprints, images of Byamee Himself, His winged Creation-helpers, maps and warnings, implements and weapons, secret tribal markings, etc. Indeed, the list continues to grow with each new site located. As in other parts of Australia, Yengo country has both men's and women's sites, apart from the more public teaching sites and the numerous "family" cave sites in the headwaters of most creeks. While our fieldwork "project" has in many sens es been a salvage operation to faithfully record what we can, recent years have enabled our work to be Figure 6. Uniquely decorated engraving of a life-sized brush-turkey (Wonarua tribe). January 1993 47</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. A truly remarkable engraving of an "emu/woman" pointing in the direction of the relevant sites for women of this totem, the line behind showing the general shape of the ridge-line she has just walked (Darginung tribe?). closely integrated into the growing cultural rejuve nation of the Goori community. As a result, we are now frequently involved in taking tribal custodians and elders to the mens sites, in the training of cus todians in fieldwork and recording techniques to use in their own tribal areas and in introducing young women to the tribal indicators ("sign-posts") rele vant to their sites. In fact, such activities are begin ning to assume greater importance for us as time goes by. In terms of the art itself, the most compelling sites for us have been the engravings. They are usually the more significant teaching places—some being "public" and others reserved solely for men—and they exude great presence. Accordingly, we have concentrated on illustrat ing engravings in this paper. But, since many of the sites are sacred, the images used have had to be care fully chosen to observe tribal law while still, hope fully, being able to convey a strong sense of the artis tic merits of what exists in Yetigo country. The illustrations derive from our tracings of the images. For the sake of "naturalism we have superimposed them onto lichen-covered sandstone backgrounds and delineated the weathered edges as well as the punctured and grooved lines. This vibrating edge effect helps to simulate the character of the engraved marks when cast into relief using oblique lamplight, which is how we encounter them in the course of our night recordings. It is our view that the feats of draftsmanship evi dent in these images are truly remarkable and would astound many of the most celebrated artists of mod ern times (Picasso, Matisse, Brancusi, and Pollock come to mind). The ability to convey so much form with so little line on such a scale is impressive to say the least. Some or the images are huge (six meters plus) and exist on undulating expanses of rock where, at times, it is virtually impossible to see them in their entirety. Indeed, it is doubtful that any artist living today could emulate the achievements of the sandstone engravers. None of our canvases are large enough nor do we retain as deeply-apprehended a spiritual relationship with our materials and surroundings. Nor do we have the creative motivation. This may seem a harsh view of contemporary Western art—and an overly-romanticized view of the sand stone art—but todays artist-reader would probably support it. Spiritual or totemic kinship with ones subject-matter and the concomitant custodial responsibility in depicting it simply do not apply in our non-tribal societies. Or, to put it another way, empathy is no substitute for what we might call "symbiotic identification:" I AM this kangaroo I am carving. These seemingly simple outline engravings and the (mainly) dry ochre paintings of Yengo country are, as can be seen, very different from much of the art found elsewhere on the continent. I hey have a stark, almost raw visual power about them and they look very old. None have yet been dated to our knowledge but many were undoubtedly refreshed from generation to generation—and were likely to have been embellished on ceremonial occasions in the locally-occurring brown, red, orange, yellow, and white pigments, plus charcoal—and some may very well have been first made 20,000 years ago, and possibly earlier still. The life of every person of the sandstone tribes was imbued with age-old sacred learning. Without even delving into tnose aspects or cultural aeptn attending the life of the individual upon his/her ini tiation into ceremonial being, this aspect can be guessed at through using basic common-sense, ror example, in our time when knowledge of the plan et's geography, its geological past, and its galactic 48 January 1993</page><page sequence="7">context are taken to be commonplace knowledge, it is still not impossible to identify with the notion of ones existence being framed by the edges of ones all-encompassing horizon. And that truly was the—world—as—given for the people of Yengo country for upwards of 1,000 generations! So to attempt to divide sites into sacred versus non-sacred" is rather tenuous in the broader con text. A prime example is the hand-stencil; for in South-Eastern Australia the simple act of blowing wet pigment from one's mouth onto one's hand placed on a cave wall is not merely to attest to one's presence there but is, in fact, an act of devotion, of thanks, of celebration. The same could also be said af the act of sharpening one's axe in a smooth groove aeside a creek, that groove having been shaped by ane's forebears hundreds, perhaps even thousands, sf years earlier. Whereas the resource-laden surrounds of the Hawkesbury system to the south are known to yield up to 30 sites per square kilometer, the best we've been able to achieve in the dry ridge country around Yengo is about 14. But since the terrain itself is so rugged and because the scrubby vegetation makes surveying for sites so difficult (the forest, inciden tally, is only now beginning to re-establish itself, with diverse birdlife reappearing only over the past decade), were convinced that site-concentrations ire generally greater than our efforts have been able to show so far. And, given that we have only adequately sur veyed an area of about 50 square kilometers in all, out of a possible 2,500, the magnitude of the task ahead is absolutely awesome! Years of work thus iwait the generations of custodians to come. Notes 1.
