<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Unger: Friedrich Hölderlin. (Twayne's World Authors Series.) Boston: Twayne, 1984. 155 pages. One is not surprised to find Professor Unger's book prefaced by reflections on the vanity of his task. In a captatio benevolentiae, to which one readily responds, he points to the impossibility of offering an even marginally adequate account of Hölderlin's work in a book of this size and format. In place of «complete interpreta tions» we are to be offered for the most part «paraphrastic summaries of Hölderlin's works», together with «indications» of what Professor Unger thinks they might mean. «This procedure is intended only to provide assistance to readers encountering the poet for the first time. » Those seeking understanding of the text beyond the most elementary level are referred elsewhere. If the author's claims, or rather, disclaimers, were entirely valid, one might well be inclined to question the usefulness even of this modest undertaking. Hölderlin is not for the timid, and the first-time reader with the commitment necessary to get anything at all out of this most demanding of poets might be better advised to jump straightaway to the author's own admirable earlier book which, though it deals «only» with the major poetry, does in fact achieve the remarkable feat of introducing a great unknown and making a serious contribution to scholarship. But of course the present book justifies itself by being more than it pretends, and has much to offer all of us, not least to seasoned readers. This is not because of any disingenuousness on Professor Unger's part - it is simply that obliging one of the most knowledgeable of Hölderlin critics to work under this particular set of constraints (for the purposes of the Twayne Series) produces some interesting results. To be true, initial apprehension seems to be borne out by the opening biographical chapter which attempts to put &lt;Hölderlin in Contexts The need for compression manifests itself in the virtual reduction to a paratactic listing of bare facts, or bare suppositions for which no evidence can be accommodated (thus we are told that critics have noted that «certain» Pietistic writings had «some» influence on the ideas expressed in «some» of the later hymns). One senses and shares the author's exasperation. The unfortunate effect of such a skeletal narrative is to make Hölderlin sound more of an eccentric than he really was (though, admittedly, the chronicle of his battle against Fritz von Kalb's masturbatory habits does make amusing reading).</page><page sequence="2">78 Besprechungen/Reviews Professor Unger obviously feels more at home when he moves on to the actual works, but here too the laconic summarizing produces a jarring, and occasionally even comic contrast between the dry, sober diction it necessitates and the often extraordinary content of the work so treated. At times, indeed, it can seem as if the author, aware of this and determined to make the best of it, exploits his narrowly circumscribed role to play Zeitblom to Hölderlin's Leverkiihn, affecting a certain arch bewilderment: «Greek civilization is viewed as a time of joyous day and of divine presence, which to Hölderlin apparently meant that the gods were literally present and perceptible through the senses ... It is not wholly clear in &lt;Brot und Wein&gt; whether the other &lt;gods&gt; are elemental, anthropomorphic, or both; perhaps the ambiguity here is intentional.» (p. 73) In this book nothing in fact can be «wholly clear», everything is only «perhaps» the case; many different readings are «possible», even if the author occasionally has the temerity to suggest that a particular one might be «preferred» - perhaps? But this assumption of almost extreme detachment and distance from the subject-matter, together with a degree of self-effacement which must be unique in Hölderlin studies, is probably the most honest approach to the task in hand. And it is not as if we were never granted the occasional glimpse behind the mask of agnostic ism. Into his chapter on Hyperion, for instance, Professor Unger manages to smuggle some of the most sensible and perceptive comments on the novel that have yet been made (whilst successfully leaving the uninformed reader under the impression that he has culled it all elsewhere). Nor, thankfully, are his «paraphrastic summaries» of the major poems as innocent as he would have us believe. Whilst the adopted procedure could be tedious in the extreme when applied to more or less conventional prose works, in the case of poetry, and particularly poetry of such «syntactical and intellectual complexity», there is something to be said for it. Professor Unger can hardly offer us a synopsis of the plot of &lt;Friedensfeier&gt;. Inevitably, what we get is commentary and interpretation, and no amount of futile hedging can prevent this. In taking us through the poems the author is obliged to make choices at every turn. He can try to let the work speak for itself, but then he must choose what to quote, and for that he is punished by having to supply literal prose translations which again reveal his hand (and occasionally astonish this reviewer by turning up unconsidered readings of even apparently unproblematic passages). At the same time his brief does not allow him to stake his own ground and choose his own emphasis in the way that most of us would do as a matter of course. He is obliged to be reasonably (and unreasonably) catholic, attempting to make sense of some works he would probably rather leave at arm's length, all the while being both comprehensive and comprehensible. It is a fascinating struggle. Overall a high standard of accuracy is achieved, though the book is not without error. Page 71 has a badly garbled quotation from the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics; on page 87 brother Tello is consistently, if not providentially, metamorphosed into Tellos; page 129 has «because» for «became»; and Schubart's initials are normally C. F. D., rather than D. C. as on p. 15 (nor would anyone who had read him be quite so casually dismissive of his poetry); it is not self-evident why</page><page sequence="3">Besprechungen/Reviews 79 an index which includes Ehrenstein and Goebbels should exclude Klopstock and Schubart, amongst others. It would be unfair to be harsh on the translations; but some are idiosyncratic, if not downright erroneous - for instance, the rendering of «schicksalskundig» as if it were «schicksalskündend». Professor Unger has apossibly unrivalled knowledge of the secondary literature on Hölderlin, and his select bibliography is both substantial and helpful. Nevertheless, it ought to have included, together with the book-length studies, the essays and articles to which he makes reference in the notes ; nor, in a list of works «most likely to be of use to the beginning student of Hölderlin», should this reviewer's dissertation (extant in 3 copies) have been included at the expense of E. C. Mason's Hölderlin and Goethe. These are, however, very minor quibbles, compared with what has been accomplished. The sections on Hyperion, &lt;Der Rhein&gt;, and &lt;Patmos&gt; are particularly fine, but Professor Unger gives good value on virtually all the significant work (though for some this would include «Stuttgarts and there must surely be more than one critic who likes &lt;Emilie&gt;).
