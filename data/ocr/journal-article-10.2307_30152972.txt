SUMNER AND ANCEL B. KEYS Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California I. INTRODUCTION T HE senior author, in 1911, published the results of a rather extended series of observations upon the pigmentary changes which occurred in various species of flounders in response to changes in the optical properties of their background.' In the course of these studies various problems of considerable theoretical interest were encountered, one of which was discussed at some length, al- though the experimental evidence on the subject was not at that time decisive. The nature of this problem may best be indicated by quotations from the earlier article. In discussing the experiments upon Rhomboidichthys, I pointed out that the degree of illumination of the background had little or no effect upon the reaction which the fish underwent. As a special illustration of this principle, it was shown that a fish became paler upon a white bottom, even though this was heavily shaded, than upon a gray bottom exposed to a considerable measure of light. The latter surface, in my experiments with Rhomboidichthys, was shown photo- graphically to be very much lighter than the former. Identical results were ob- tained with Lophopsetta 2 It is plain that, in order that the change of shade on the part of the fish should be adaptive, the latter would have to behave exactly as described. When, however, we begin to inquire as to the visual stimuli responsible for the changes just recorded, the case becomes decidedly puzzling. For anyone with any knowl- edge of optics knows that gray-at least a perfectly neutral gray-is not a color It differs from white only in this, that it reflects a smaller fraction of the total quantity of light which falls upon its surface. Gray is thus relatively darker than white, but not always absolutely darker. When we ourselves judge I F. B. Sumner, Jour. Exp.

KEYS of an object as being gray or white we make an allowance for the degree of il- lumination to which it is subjected, and this last is inferred from the totality of the visual field., But how about the fish? It is not in the position of an outside observer, with abundant standards of comparison at hand. This tank, with its painted sur- faces, would seem to constitute for the time being its entire environment. How, then, if the walls of the shaded white box reflect absolutely less light to the ani- mal's eyes than do those of the brightly lighted gray box, does the creature take on a lighter shade in the former than in the latter? So far as I can see, we are limited to two alternative explanations: either (i) the fish takes into account the degree of illumination, just as we do, and makes due allowance for this in judging of the paleness or darkness of the background; or (2) it makes a direct visual comparison between its own surface and that of the background and endeavors to bring the former into harmony with the latter. [Any possible "anthropomorphic' construction of these words was disclaimed in a footnote]. In this second case, since the body of the fish itself is lighted or shaded to an equal extent with the background, it would have to become fully white in order to conform even to a dimly lighted white background [op. cit., pp. 460-631]. The first of these alternative interpretations of the phenomena in question was later stated as follows: From the fish's point of view, the only other element of the visual field, be- sides the bottom and walls of its tank, is the illuminated area overhead, repre- senting the source of light-commonly sunlight reflected from objects outside the tank. May not, then, the ratio between the light reflected from the nearby surfaces within the tank and the light which enters the latter from above be that factor of the total stimulus which renders possible these accurate adjustments of the shade of the fish's body to that of its background?2 I think that this is the true solution of the problem, and I hope, with apparatus already constructed, to put the question to experimental test, as soon as material is available [p. 477]. The experimental test here referred to was attempted, somewhat later, though unsuccessfully. The chief disturbing element was the presence of vegetable detritus and other opaque substances sus- pended in the water-supply of the laboratory. These settled upon the clear glass plates upon which the fishes rested, and soon rendered I That even the human observer may be utterly deceived in this matter was well illustrated in the course of the experiments to be described here. Under certain condi- tions, a gray plate appeared to us and to several other persons as plainly white, and the illusion was corrected only by inserting an actual white plate alongside of it.-S.

But the plan to put this problem to an experimental test was never entirely abandoned, and it was finally brought to a successful issue during the last year. The experiments here to be described relate to the first of the alternative hypotheses stated above. Before proceeding to discuss these experiments we must dispose of the other hypothesis men- tioned, namely, that the fish makes a direct visual comparison be- tween its own surface and the background. In the earlier article (Sumner, 1911) certain tests of this visual comparison idea were discussed. These consisted of (i) covering the entire fish, or a part thereof, with black or white cloth, attached to the body by stitches; (2) staining those areas of the skin which fell within the fish's field of vision; (3) incidental observations on fishes which were completely buried in sand, except for the eyes. The results of the first two sets of tests were not wholly consistent among themselves, and they were partially invalidated by the abnor- mal conditions which were introduced. On the whole, they did not support the visual comparison hypothesis. But observations upon the behavior of one fish which persistently covered itself with sand furnished strong evidence against this hypothesis. The fish in ques- tion was transferred from a white background, upon which it had become extremely pale, to very dark sand. In spite of its burying it- self completely, barring the stalked eyes, and of remaining com- pletely buried (except possibly at night) the fish assumed the cus- tomary dark shade, probably with normal rapidity. A repetition of the experiment gave identical results. Mast,' who does not regard these last observations as decisive, owing to the possibility that small areas of the fish's head may have remained exposed to view, made similar tests under more rigid condi- tions. He removed one eye from his specimens and kept the entire head, except the remaining eye, carefully covered with sand. He ob- tained the same result, however, namely, that the fish underwent the usual adaptive change, regardless of its being unable to observe its own skin surface. Before discussing our own recent experiments, we shall consider 'Bulletin United States Bureau of Fisheries (published 1916), XXXIV, 173-238, Plates XIX-XXXVII. VOL. II, No. 4, OCTOBER, 1929]</page><page sequence="4">498 FRANCIS V. SUMNER AND ANCEL B. KEYS briefly Mast's tests of the alternative hypothesis, that of reaction to a ratio between the source of light and the light reflected from the substratum. Mast employed two types of apparatus, one in which the brightness of the background (substratum) could be increased, while the light from above (apparent source of illumination) could be diminished or cut off altogether; and another, in which the light falling upon the fish's eyes from above could be greatly increased, without the background being affected by this source of illumination. In experiments with the former apparatus, the fish was placed in a circular glass dish surrounded by a tall cylinder of opaque material, which could be covered above by a dark cloth. Sheets of translucent white or gray paper were inserted beneath the glass dish, and light was reflected from below by a mirror. A number of interesting re- sults were obtained in the course of these experiments, of which the following are of chief interest at present: (I) fishes assumed the maximum degree of pallor under these conditions of illumination, even upon gray paper; (2) when the underlying sheet was spotted heavily with india ink, the spots were "ignored" and the fish became uniformly pale, although this same sheet called forth a spotted pat- tern upon the fish under normal conditions of illumination. The former of these results is quite in harmony with those which we have obtained with a somewhat different type of apparatus, and supports directly the "ratio" theory discussed above. The second is likewise of interest in showing the influence of the overhead illumina- tion, even in responses to patterns. In Mast's second type of apparatus, a similar glass dish and opaque cylinder were employed, but light was not admitted from be- low. The white background was but feebly illuminated, owing to the opaque cylinder surrounding it, which was covered at the top by cloth. Under these conditions, taken by themselves, the fish would be expected to assume the maximum degree of pallor, as indeed it did. Mast now poised a vertical tube over the fish, in sfich a way that light, reflected through this from above by a miiror, reached the animal's eyes.without appreciably illuminating the white back- ground. One's first belief would naturally be that the "ratio" theory called for a darkening of the fish under these conditions. But such did not occur. The animal, if already of maximum pallor, remained [PHYSIOLOGICAL ZO6LOGY</page><page sequence="5">EFFECTS OF ILLUMINATION ON SHADE IN FLATFISH 499 so. In fact, "in all of these tests the fish retained the shade it had at the beginning of the increase in illumination from above, no matter whether it was dark or light or mottled." This Mast explains on the ground that "the excessive illumination of the eyes from above entirely prevented stimulation by light reflected from the white background" (op. cit., p. 213). To this defect in technique, fully recognized by Mast, we may add a second one, namely that the overhead light was too narrowly localized. The apparent source of illumination, which constitutes the first term of the ratio direct: reflected light,' certainly comprises a much larger part of the field of vision than was affected by Mast's 3-centimeter (in one case 3-millimeter) tube. It is likely from other experiments (see following) that the entire visual field of the fish, above a certain rather low level, may figure as the "source" of light, in the sense in which the word is here employed. Despite the admitted inconclusiveness of his second series of ex- periments (which were repeated with some modifications), Mast be- lieves that "they do throw considerable doubt on the validity of this [the ratio] hypothesis." While recognizing that "the effect of the light received from the background must be modified, in some way, by light received from some other source," he concludes that "this modification is, however, in all probability, not so simple as is de- manded by the hypothesis in question" (p. 214). II. ACCOUNT OF PRESENT SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS For these experiments, a small species of flounder, Hypsopsetta guttulata (Girard), belonging to the turbot group, was employed. This happens to be the most available local species. The specimens used were seined in False (Mission) Bay, San Diego. These were young individuals, mostly o0 centimeters or less in length. The capac- ity of this species for chromatic adjustments proved, however, to be rather limited in comparison with the forms previously used either by the senior author or by Mast. This limitation was found to be especially marked in its reactions to a white background. While such a surface commonly called forth I This is the ratio, in the form given by Keeble and Gamble. In that given by Sumner (1911), the terms are in reverse order (see above). VOL. II, No. 4, OCTOBER, I9291</page><page sequence="6">500 FRANCIS B. SUMNER AND ANCEL B. KEYS ultimately a considerable paling of the fish, following transfer from a darker surface, the immediate effect was frequently an actual dark- ening. Moreover, the shade eventually attained by the animal was invariably far from white, being at best a buff or pale brown. On black or on gray of medium shade, however, the adjustment was frequently rather striking. Upon bottoms of nearly neutral gray, in particular, the animal itself commonly assumed a neutral gray tone, losing almost every trace of brown or yellow. Since it seemed possible that a pure white surface led to an over- stimulation of the animal, inhibiting its normal tendency toward adaptive response, such surfaces were not employed in any except the preliminary tests. Instead of white, a very pale, nearly neutral gray was used, and this was commonly more nearly approximated by the fish. One fact, which was evident in the earlier studies, must be reck- oned with in any experiments upon color changes in flounders. This is the great individual variability in the capacity for adaptive re- sponses to backgrounds. Some individuals, even those which are ap- parently otherwise normal, are extremely refractory, and may show but slight change after transfer to a strikingly different background. Such fishes obviously must be rejected as material for experiments of the sort here considered. Any results obtained from them would not be contradictory of positive results obtained from other individuals with a proved capacity for adjustment. They would merely be ir- relevant. As in the case of Mast's experiments, cited above, two different types of apparatus were used, designed to produce opposite condi- tions of stimulation. In the first of these, the substratum was bright- ly illuminated by light which entered the tank below the level of the fish, while the apparent source of illumination (above the fish) was feeble. In the second case, the light entered the tank above the level of the fish, while the substratum was inclined away from this at such an angle as to be shaded. Figures I and 2 represent in cross-section the apparatus employed in the two cases. The aquarium tanks here used were rectangular, 40 by 25.5 centimeters in horizontal dimensions, and 25.5 centi- meters high (interior measurements). The fish, in each case, rested [PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">EFFECTS OF ILLUMINATION ON SHADE IN FLATFISH 501 upon a transparent glass plate, raised about 9 centimeters from the bottom of the tank.

KEYS walls of the aquarium tanks, with the exception of the clear areas to be mentioned here, were rendered opaque by gray paint, of the darker of the two shades used upon the "background" plates. The two pieces of apparatus differed from one another in the fol- lowing respects: in the first case (Fig. I), the transparent area in the wall of the outer tank was below the level of the fish, while the "back- ground" plate, here of the darker shade of gray, was tilted toward the light. Light was excluded, wholly or partly, from overhead by a mov- able wooden cover. In the second case (Fig. 2), the transparent area was above the level of the fish, the "background" plate was coated with the pale gray paint, and was tilted away from the light. Likewise the diffused light of the room was allowed to enter freely from above. The chief source of illumination, in each case, was light from a nearby window, partly covered by a roller shade, so that the rays entered at a plane approximately horizontal. The lighter and darker gray paints employed for the back- grounds, were very close to the "dawn gray" and "slate gray," re- spectively, of Ridgway's Color Standards and Nomenclature.' Control aquariums, of the same size as the foregoing, were provi- ded with painted plates of these two shades of gray. In the controls, however, the plates were horizontally placed, and rested directly upon the bottoms of the tanks. Likewise the fish were commonly in immediate contact with these painted backgrounds, and both animal and background received light from the same sources, i.e., from above and also (usually) through the side walls of the tank. In our experiments a fish was transferred from one or another of these "control" tanks, with the bottom of which its color had come into harmony, to one or another of the "experimental" tanks. The occurrence and the extent of any resulting change of shade were de- termined in one of two ways. (i) The fish, after a sufficiently long sojourn in the "experimental" tank (from one to several days), was quickly removed to the "control" background, from which it had I These comparisons have been made with the paints when seen through the glass plates (as was done by the fish) and when dry. After soaking in sea water they became somewhat paler in appearance, and the rust in the water-supply of the station gave rise to a slight brownish deposit which had to be removed from time to time. [PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">EFFECTS OF ILLUMINATION ON SHADE IN FLATFISH 503 been taken, and compared with the latter and with "control" fishes which had become well adjusted to this background. (2) A fish from the proper "control" tank was transferred to the "experimental" one, and compared with the fish in question, before the "control" fish had time to change. According to the hypothesis which we are testing, the following results would be expected from the four possible types of experiment: i. From darker gray control background to experimental tank No. I: fish should become paler. 2. From pale gray control background to experimental tank No. i: fish should remain pale. 3. From darker gray control background to experimental tank No. 2: fish should remain (relatively) dark. 4. From pale gray control background to experimental tank No. 2: fish should become (relatively) dark. All four of these tests were carried out, as follows: (i) fourteen trials, (2) two trials, (3) one trial, (4) four trials. Only four of the trials gave negative results, all of these being in Test i. Ten fishes were actually employed in these experiments, a num- ber of others being rejected, owing to their limited capacity for color change. Of the ten experimental fishes, eight gave only results of the "expected" type, while two gave only negative results. The latter were both poor "performers," which remained distinctly darker than their associates upon the control backgrounds. Their behavior can- not be regarded as seriously weakening the positive evidence. It was necessary, of course, to eliminate the possibility that the results obtained in the experimental tanks were affected in any im- portant way by the elevation of fishes above these backgrounds. To test this matter a plate of clear glass was raised above the gray bot- tom in one of the control tanks. The distance (about 3.5 centimeters) was approximately the mean distance between the transparent glass plate and the background in the experimental tanks. Two of the fishes used in the main series of experiments were tested for this pur- pose. The results gave satisfactory evidence that elevating above the background did not affect the shade of gray assumed. Likewise, another fish was placed in experimental tank No. i, with the lower window covered, so that illumination was entirely VOL. II, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 19291</page><page sequence="10">504 FRANCIS B. SUMNER AND ANCEL B. KEYS from above. The reaction was that ordinarily called forth by the darker gray, until light was admitted from below, whereupon the fish rapidly paled. Attention should be called to the relative position of the fish and of the source of illumination in Figure 2, which has been drawn ap- proximately to scale. It is evident that most of the light rays reach- ing the flounder fell within an angle of less than 45 degrees with the glass plate on which the latter rested. Thus the "source" of illumi- nation (the "direct" light of the ratio) may here have comprised all the light that reached the fish outside of a rather small angle with the horizontal., To sum up the results of these experiments, it may be stated that, barring the behavior of a few refractory individuals, whose ad- justments were poor under any circumstances, the responses were such as would be called for by the "ratio" hypothesis discussed in the foregoing. A background of moderately dark gray, brightly lighted from below, in conjunction with a feeble apparent source of illumi- nation, evoked the maximum degree of pallor; while a much paler background, inclined so as to receive but little of the light which fell upon the fish from above the level of its eyes, called forth a distinctly darker condition. It should be explained, however, that this "ratio" principle is not here construed in any strictly quantitative sense. It is merely main- tained that, speaking generally, the shade assumed by the fish de- pends directly upon the intensity of the light reflected from the sub- stratum ("background") and inversely upon the intensity of the light received from above (outside of a certain angle with the hori- zontal). I That portions of the fish's field of vision above the level of its body may be com- prised in the effective "background," and influence the animal's reaction in a positive sense, has been shown by earlier experiments (Sumner, 1911, pp. 451-55).
