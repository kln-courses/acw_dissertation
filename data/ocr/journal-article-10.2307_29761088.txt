<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR* by Glendon Schubertf A major influence upon modern political science has been the impact of the behavioral sciences, particularly that of sociology and social psychology. The resulting mode of political inquiry has become known as the political behavior approach. 1 The behavioral movement has recast into a more scientific posture the work in all fields of political science, but the timing and the rate of change have been different for the various subfields of the discipline.! Those to cling longest to the work ways of the past were the subfields of political philosophy and public law, and their intransigence is reflected in the judgment of their colleagues who rated philosophy and law as the- subfields of least importance to the contemporary study of political science.3 But the yeast of behavioralism already had begun to ferment within the oak staves of traditional doctrine encapsulating?from each other, as well as from the rest of political science?both political philosophy and public law; and, at least within public law, the reformulation of research orientations4 to bring them into line with the rest of the discipline already was well advanced at the time of the survey upon which the ratings were based.5 It is possible to denote seeds of potential change that had been sown at an * A paper presented in oral form at a meeting of the American Bar Association's Special Committee on Electronic Data Retrieval, on August 6,1967, in Honolulu, Hawaii* t William R.

Robinson,9 and Felix Cohen.10) It was not until after World War II and the appearance of C. Herman Pritchett's book onThe Roosevelt Courts to be followed after a gap of more than half a dozen years by Jack W. Peltason's monograph on the federal judiciary,12 that public lawyers, at least among political scientists, began to pay serious attention to theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of courts and judges (alternative to the traditional approaches of history, law, and philosophy) such as those provided by small group and interest group analyses?the former proposed by Pritchett, the latter by Peltason. Even then, sustained and continuous activity by several persons, working largely independently but simultaneously, did not begin until about the time that Joseph Tanenhaus ventured a preliminary report to the profession on his exploratory quantitative studies under a grant from the Social Science Research Council.13 Although to some extent parallel modifications have been on-going in the orientations of some law professors to the study of law,14 the impression gained by an outside observer is that behavioral jurisprudence has thus far secured a much more tenuous beachhead in the law schools than in political science faculties.15 Readers of this journal are quite familiar with the uses of computer technology for such purposes as document retrieval and the logical analysis of norm concepts in the content analysis of such documents; here I wish to direct attention, instead, to the quite different function that computers have been assigned by political scientists working in the field of behavioral jurisprudence. The difference is symbolized, indeed, by the disparate degrees of sympathy and antipathy that lawyers and political scientists have shown toward describing their respective activities by invoking the rubric which distinguishes this journal: "jurimetrics." Jurimetrics is a lawyers' concept, and the reasons which explain why it has come into vogue in the legal, but not in the political science, 6. CG.

Put most simply and perhaps crudely, lawyers are (at least some of them) interested in the measurement of law; political scientists are not. Public law scholars in political science do not want to measure anything; they are practitioners of an ancient and long-respected art. Judicial process proponents want to describe court systems, within the context of larger political, social, and economic systems. As long, at least, as quantification remains relatively unsophisticated and does not begin to dominate the structure of the design of empirical research projects (to say nothing of the design of research theory and hypotheses), advocates of the process approach are amenable to the use of measurement in the study of politics. But for these political scientists law is policy, and they are much more interested in trying to measure its sources and consequences in the form of social action than in measuring policy as substantive content. This leaves the political behavioralsists, and, although they are the most supportive (among these three subgroups of political scientists) to the systematic measurement of data, they reject the implication that the study of law is the object of their inquiry. They want to understand human behavior in the context of sociopolitical situations that involve the professional roles of lawyers, and they are much more interested in understanding such political behavior at the level of systematic theory than they are in the empirical description?even the quantified description?of the same class of events. For students of behavioral jurisprudence, "jurimetrics" gives too much emphasis to law (instead of to behavior) and to measurement (instead of theory). In political science of the modern, computerized era?that is to say, in the political science of the last half dozen years or so?computer technology has been important primarily as an instrument to facilitate the processing and statistical analysis of data for purposes of research. The primary function of computers has been to generate new information, rather than to try to keep track of (or even to gain access to) information that previously has been or currently is being produced. I do not wish to seem to demean the latter task or its intrinsic importance, particularly in relation to the very different professional needs and practices of law from those of political science; rather, I seek to make the point that the the use of computers in political science to facilitate research is a quite different emphasis than appears to have been given to the use of computers thus far in legal work. The difference in the instrumental application of computers in behavioral jurisprudence reflects the characteristics of the behavioral approach as a scientific mode of inquiry: (I) The behavioral approach seeks to develop systematic theoretical knowledge, relying upon the use of controlled methods of observation, operationalized concepts, and the testing of hypotheses that are formulated before data are collected. Such an approach stands in contradis? tinction to one, frequently found in legal research, in which data are collected and analyzed and then post hoc "explanations" offered as possible interpre? tations of the relationships denoted.I6 (2) The behavioral approach is interdisciplinary and crosscultural in the scope of its affiliations and interests; it seeks to focus upon and to understand what is common in human action, transactions, and interaction across both space and time. Adjudicative behavior is of interest precisely to the extent that the understanding of judicial-like 16. E.g., S. S. Nagel, Testing Empirical Generalizations in Legal Research, 15 J. LEGAL ED. 365-81 (1963). 5 8 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="4">decision-making can contribute to more general decision-making theory. But this stands in sharp contrast to the typically intradisciplinary, subcultural (viz., parochial) focus of legal method. As Loevinger has pointed out, "the dialectic method of law stands as a formal, flexible, clinical approach to data gathering which is suitable to the investigation of individual cases but not to group or mass phenomena."17 (3) The behavioral approach is empirical in its orientation toward data; the reality in which it is interested consists of the consensual perceptions of equivalently trained observers. Its "facts," that is to say, are functions of interpersonal agreement. Legal study, to the contrary, seems much less concerned with what people do than with statements about what some persons think others ought to do, and the "facts" with which it is concerned are determined (also contrariwise) as functions of interpersonal disagreement. But it is nonetheless in its emphasis upon empiricism (as distinguished from ideational sources of data) that the behavioral approach finds its closest link with legal method, in the research activities of American legal realists. (4) The behavioral approach seeks to quantify its data: The goal is theoretical statements in mathematical form, and empirical statements in statistical form. (There is no need to belabor the point that the legal approach shares neither of these aspirations.) The reason for quantification has been well expressed by an English historian of physical science: I shall distinguish first between quantified procedures and quantified concepts, and I shall take a quantified procedure in science to be one that aims at measurement, that is, any procedure that assigns numbers in a scale. To be complete such a procedure must comprise both mathematical techniques for operating the scale theoretically and measuring techniques for using it to explore the world. Technology need contain little more than procedures of these kinds, which provide for the measurements and calculations with which it is concerned. But most sciences aim beyond these at providing explanations by means of a system of theory. So a quantified science, as distinct from quantified technology, comprises not only quantified procedures but also quantified explanatory concepts, each applicable to the other within a theoretical system. The development of a science then takes place through a dialogue between its theories and its procedures, the former offering an exploration of the expected world through predictions and explanations made by means of the technical procedures, and the latter confronting these theoretical expectations with the test of quantified data. A dialogue of this kind requires that both sides should speak the same language. We are so familiar with the close and precise adaptation of conceptual and procedural language to each other in modern physics that it may come as a surprise to find authentic scientific systems in which this is not the case. Yet we do not have to look very far to find examples. In the contemporary social sciences and in psychology, they are notorious. We do not have to go many decades back in the history of modern genetics to find a very incomplete and interrupted dialogue between theories and procedures. Somewhat earlier, in the eighteenth century, we find the same situation in chemistry. The main interest of medieval physics in this context seems to me to be that it provides the earliest example in the development of modern science in which we can study the state of affairs when the dialogue between concepts and procedures was incomplete or absent. Then we can study the difference it made when clear and exact communication was opened, as it was in the seventeenth century.18 The implication of the last sentence?that the birth of Albert Einstein remained two full centuries away, as a possible (but certainly improbable) event of a 17.

As Felix Cohen remarked, apropos of earlier attempts to infuse the behavioral approach into legal pedagogy, "The first steps taken are clumsy and evoke smiles of sympathy or roars of laughter from critics of diverse temperaments. The will to walk persists."19 The computer is a useful instrument in research in behavioral jurisprudence because (i) it facilitates inquiry by reducing time costs, thus freeing the investigator for less routine operations. (Anyone who has ever calculated a forty variable correlation matrix, which contains 380 different coefficients, by means of pencil-and-paper, or with a mechanically-operated desk machine?to say nothing of factor analyzing such a matrix using the same procedures?will readily appreciate the difference that computers make in this regard.); (2) it makes feasible many types of inquiry that could not have been undertaken heretofore. (See, e.g., a recent study of judicial sentencing behavior, in which a set of samples of about 150,000 cases was drawn from a universe of about 2,000,000 cases.20); and (3) it provides, increasingly, better data (in the sense of empirical observations that have been transformed by the researcher into quantified units suitable for measurement manipulations21) by making feasible a greatly expanded repertoire of alternative modes of analysis. (Ante-computer factor analysis, for example, was largely confined to such relatively gross and approximate procedures as those of the complete centroid method, with relatively few iterations and?usually?graphical procedures for rotation; princi? pal axes factor analysis is now routine, coupled with extensive iterations, a choice among various orthogonal and oblique rotational solutions, and with a plotting subroutine for whatever output one may choose to specify.) But the computer, notwithstanding these manifest advantages, is not without its limitations: Among others, the computer (i) asks no questions; (2) provides no answers; and (3) solves no problems?and it is a disservice to scientific inquiry to tout the contrary, as some enthusiasts appear to have done. In order to explore the implications of these dogmatically phrased assertions, I should like to discuss an example gleaned from an article by Harold Lasswell published a dozen years ago at the very threshhold of the technological revolution that the computer was to bring to behavioral (along with other branches of) science. Lasswell might seem to be an appropriate choice as a spokesman, for present purposes, because he is one of the world's most renowned behavioral scientists, he is one of the few political scientists who is a member of a faculty of law, and in this article he explicitly is concerned with the development of creativity in a society whose decision-making processes will become increasingly computerized.22 Lasswell explicitly raises the question, in this article, that the time might soon be at hand when engineers could construct a "bench of judicial robots"?as Professor Lasswell, characteristically, chose to 19.

Q. 381-99 (1955). 60 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="6">express it, juxtaposing a novel idea with rather old-fashioned words. The Supreme Court, he suggested, might be an appropriate object for simulation.23 But after a suitable period of experimentation, during which the engineering problems would be resolved and techniques perfected, the community would be given an opportunity "to develop a rational consensus on whether to use [the judicial] robots or not?viz., on the substitution of a computer for the Supreme Court. From the standpoint of 1967 the proposal seems to be at least as antiquarian as it is audacious. Note that the metaphor "bench of judicial robots" is, like its second substantive (robots), explicitly anthropomorphic. But robots had had it, even by 1955, except for purposes of entertainment (as in Bob Cummings's "living doll") rather than for those of science. Man-like machines were displaced by less romantic, but more functional, models. As one of the few persons who, at least thus far, has been disanthropomorphized and depersonal? ized into the image of a computer (by an evidently unhappy and doubtless misanthropic lawyer),24 I feel that it is important to make a clear distinction between people and computers. I have argued elsewhere, incidentally, my opinions that both humans and computers have their strong and weak points and that, in a more rational world, efforts would be made so to structure decision-making processes?including research investigations?as to maximize the strengths and to minimize the weaknesses of both computers and their human masters.25 It may well be that, as one student of Professor Lasswell's work has suggested to me, in this particular passage of the article the author was merely indulging some free association, and with tongue in cheek at that. Doubtless this is the correct interpretation to make, particularly in view of the evident thrust of the rest of the article in favor of creativity rather than of automation. Even so, there are plenty of others around who would not blink at the proposal, once the technology can be demonstrated to be adequate to the task. I intend, therefore, to take the proposition at face value and to consider the question of feasibility from a more extensive and behavioral point of view that goes beyond its merely engineering and technological aspects. It certainly seems correct that already, within a dozen years from Lasswell's writing, a fairly good start could be made in the programming of judicial values.26 (Note that I do not speak of "feeding" these values to the computer, as appears to be the mode of discourse among many contemporary commentators who write about interactions between humans and machines. For one thing, my sensitive nature is appalled by the thought of pushing too far the explicit analogizing of computers to the alimentary canal; for another, my reading several years ago of a particularly seminal article by Martin Landau27 has made me sceptical of the degree of intellectual clarity that is to be gained by the maladroit mixing of biological with mechanical metaphors. Certainly there are available on today's market several different computers 23. Id. at p. 398. Cf G. Schubert, Simulation of the Supreme Court (forthcoming, 1968). 24. Book review, 81 POL. SCI.

Merely documentary judicial inputs such as briefs and records of lower court proceedings evidently could be filed, with the Computer Court, as tapes. Oral argument should present not much greater challenge than does the programming of teaching machines. And a number of advantages can readily be visualized. "Delay in the court," a problem which lawyers have found troublesome (at a somewhat earlier time, in the Supreme Court itself; and in most metropolitan civil courts today), could be cut to the few hours that might be required for "turn around time" in making as many runs as might be necessary?and usually only one would suffice?to produce a decision in a case. Actual decision time would be a few seconds, or a few minutes at the most, and quite possibly microseconds would suffice for the more routine decisions as the technology improves. And the Computer Court could tremendously expand the number of decisions made on the merits each year; perhaps there would need to be only a single decision day per year instead of the 20-25 now required, and the costs of administration for the Court could be greatly reduced. The Computer Court could, for example, be completely installed in a small room, approximately of the same dimensions as the one in the basement of the old Capitol building in which the Supreme Court used to meet under John Marshall, thus obviating the need for maintaining the opulent Marble Palace which houses the present Court and its (superfluous) accouterments. Contrary to the present state of uncertainty which is associated with at least a portion of the work of the Court, predictability of the decisions of the Computer Court would be perfect?for those privy to the programming and data inputs, of course. Not least, the decision-making procedure that was established for the Computer Court could readily be generalized, with only slight technical modifications, to include at the very least all of the United States Courts of Appeals as well as the Supreme Court, with consequent bigger savings in the federal budgetary allocations for both judicial personnel and housekeeping (since the same machine could probably be required to perform this somewhat expanded task, and without moving it from whatever basement room had been established for its domicile). Regrettably, there would be a few undesirable side effects, most of which can be traced directly to the Computer Court's inhuman characteristics. Indeed, a mere listing of some of the most obvious of these side effects impels one to the conclusion that, however successful the Computer Court might be from a legal point of view, the results of its establishment would be politically disastrous. To start with some that seem relatively innocuous, we might note that however unphotogenic one might deem the annual opening-of-the-term portraits of the Supreme Court that are published in The New York Times, ones of the Computer Court are not likely to be perceived by most readers to be more attractive. After all, the Computer Court cannot be constructed as a mobile, and there may be a psychological problem for readers who discover that, as they grow older, the Court will be?and will seem to be?newer in its aspect (as technological innovation proceeds) with each year that passes. The Computer Court's decision-making process will not enjoy the prestige of the present Court; it seems improbable that thousands of high school seniors from throughout the land will pass?even in single file?through the basement door to observe the quiet efficiency of the console in operation. The Computer Court, even if constructed in literal accord with Lasswell's metaphor, would lack something in the way of human interest for the masses: it could, of course, produce articles 62 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="8">on the side for popular magazines, and be listed on the letterheads of various organizations, but on the other hand it would never climb mountains, or fall off horses, or take brides. It will be easy to provide for minority interest representation in the Computer Court, but difficult to symbolize that this has been done, as some think may be the effect of the visible presence of justices such as Thurgood Marshall, Abe Fortas, and William Brennan. The Computer Court would have limited value as a scapegoat target in political billboard advertising, although its impeachment and removal from office would remain open as a technical possibility. The odds are, however, that most Computer Courts would be replaced on grounds of technological, rather than of political, obsolescence. We could not expect the Computer Court to be creative, in its political leadership role, in quite the same way in which we sometimes observe creativity in the decision-making of the present justices?in the redefining of situations, that is to say, by the posing of novel alternative possibilities for the solution of conflicts?, but the programming of random components in the decision-making process (which would be easy to do) might to some degree function as a substitute for human creativity.28 At the same time, such a modification would entail the disadvantage of precluding perfect prediction of the Court's decisional outcomes. It might well be argued, however, that the achievement of perfect predictability would be not an unmitigated virtue, but rather the Computer Court's greatest flaw, and that the greatest defect of a tested and perfected bench of judicial robots, whether in anthropomorphic or in the more conventional console form, would be its lack of uncertainty. Indeed, our examination of the implications of the Computer Court suggests the hypothesis that the ideal of certainty in law is tolerable only in the context of an empirical world in which forces inducing change are so manifold that the attainment of the goal is never possible. Lasswell concluded his article with the suggestion that the development of an expanded computer technology posed no threat to, but rather increased the need for, human creativity. The events of the past dozen years in political science research in behavioral jurisprudence certainly confirm his expectations. 28. See V.
