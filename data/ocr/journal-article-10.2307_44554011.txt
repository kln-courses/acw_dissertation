Piziali Failure Analysis Associates Jennifer Whitestone AAMRL/HEG, WPAFB Ints Kaleps and Chris Taylor AAMRL/BBM, WPAFB ABSTRACT This paper presents results of an ongoing research program to develop and validate data sets for com- puter models which accurately predict the head-neck kinematics and dynamics of existing dummies in crash environments. The mathematical model utilized for this research is the Armstrong Aerospace Medical Re- search Laboratory (AAMRL) Articulated Total Body (ATB) Model. The goal of this investigation was to review, validate, and compare ATB data sets of the Hybrid III manikin head-neck system. The data sets were based upon experimental data from the AAMRL, Prasad, and Deng, and model parameters and data sets proposed by the AAMRL, Deng, Seemann, and Wismans. Simulations of the Amended Part 572 Head- Neck Pendulum Compliance Test, of the Code of Federal Regulations, were performed to validate these data sets. The predicted model responses were com- pared to compliance test specifications and published experimental data from the Transportation Research Center of Ohio. The information generated by this study should help in the understanding of the head- neck biomechanics of existing manikins and in future manikin development. INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been an increasing aware- ness of the serious consequences that can occur with head and neck injuries and the effectiveness of biomechanical studies to reduce the likelihood of these injuries. Two sources of information about head and neck injury and prevention are: (1) accident simula- tions using mathematical models; and (2) experiments with human surrogates. Mathematical modeling is an accepted technique of scientific research. Once validated by comparison with experimental results, mathematical models are useful, economical, and versatile engineering tools. They can, in lieu of direct experimentation with the actual physical systems, evaluate the effects of varying parameters on the responses of systems to a wide variety of input conditions. With these validated data sets, computer simulations of actual accident environ- ments or tests, where the head and neck are in jeopardy, can be performed and analyzed. A variety of mathematical models have been developed to predict human biodynamic responses and injury potential in impact environments. In previous studies[1,2], data sets of the Hybrid II and Hybrid III manikin head-neck structures were developed for the Armstrong Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (AAMRL) Head-Spine Model. In 1988, Paver and Fish- burne[3] proposed an Articulated Total Body (ATB) Model data set which predicts the mechanical behavior oftheHybridll manikin head-neck structure. TheCode of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 572 and Amended Part 572 Head-Neck Pendulum Compliance Tests[4] were simulated to validate these data sets. Parametric studies were conducted to assess the effects of varia- tions in neck joint characteristics upon the predicted head-neck responses. The intent of this study was to review, validate, and compare data sets of the Hybrid III manikin head-neck system. The data sets were based upon experimental data from the AAMRL[5], Prasad[6], and Deng[7] and model parameters and data sets proposed by the AAMRL[8], Deng[7], Seemann[9], and Wismans[10j. Simulations of the Amended Part 572 Head-Neck Pen- dulum Compliance Test were performed to validate these data sets. The predicted model responses were compared to compliance test specifications and pub- lished experimental data from the Transportation Re- search Center (TRC) of Ohio[13j. 669</page><page sequence="2">The information generated by this study should serve as one step toward improving the head and neck injury prediction potential of the ATB model. In particular, the proposed Hybrid III data set will be useful to re- searchers modeling experiments with this dummy. Ideally, these experiments and computer simulations will help us understand the responses of humans in similar crash environments. The ATB data set develop- ment and parametric studies will also serve as a prelimi- nary effort toward the development and validation of human data sets with accurate neck descriptions. BACKGROUND Model. The mathematical model selected for this study was a whole-body gross-motion simulator model. The ATB Model, which is a modified version of the Calspan Crash Victim Simulator (CVS) Model [14-1 6], is used for several Air Force applications including aircraft ejec- tions, survivable aircraft crash assessments, and the consideration of the effects on neck loading due to various head encumbrance configurations. The equa- tions of motion and constraint are formulated from Euler's rigid body equations of motion with Lagrange- type constraints. These equations are solved using a Vector Exponential Integrator and quaternions. In most applications, the crash victim is represented by fifteen segments and fourteen joints; the neck joints are typi- cally ball-and-socket types. The Hybrid III Head-Neck Structure. The Hybrid III manikin is a state-of-the-art biofidelic anthropomorphic dummy. The head is a hollow two-piece casting of 356-T6 aluminum with a vinyl skin cover. The molded neck is constructed of alternate layers of aluminum and rubber elastomer. The rubber layers are asymmetric to give different mechanical responses in flexion and ex- tension. A steel cable runs through the center of the neck to provide axial strength. Aluminum plates are molded into each end of the neck to facilitate head- neck and neck-thorax attachments. A load cell is mounted in the head and attaches to the neck at the occipital condyle joint, a pin joint with rubber nodding blocks. An adjustable bracket connects the neck and pendulum. The Head-Neck Pendulum Test. All Hybrid III calibra- tion test procedures and performance standards are described in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Part 572 Amended. The head-neck test consists of a pendulum drop (Figure 1). At the bottom of the pendulum's swing, the arm impacts a block of honeycomb; this produces a near square wave pen- dulum deceleration pulse. The head-neck system, which is mounted to the end of the pendulum, under- goes no impact. The environmental conditions, test apparatus (geometric and inertial properties), in- strumentation requirements, and test procedures are specified. Hybrid III dummy head-neck calibration tests differ from those used for the Hybrid II dummy: 1. The Hybrid II dummy requires only a flexion test. Both flexion and extension tests are required for the Hybrid III dummy. The specifications for the head-neck mounting position and the strike plate deceleration pulse and impact velocity differ for flexion and extension. 2. Part 572 and Part 572 Amended specify different performance parameters for the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies. There are three ways that the Hybrid II head-neck response is specified: a. Head rotation vs. time b. Chordal displacement of the head eg vs. time c. Peak head acceleration and average head acceleration above 20 g's. There are two ways that the Hybrid III head- neck response is specified: a. D-plane rotation vs. time (defined in Figure 1) b. Moment about the occipital condyles vs. time. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA SETS Four ATB data sets of the Hybrid III head-neck system were studied. The ATB data sets consisted of three segments (the pendulum, head, and neck segments) and three joints (the head-neck or HN, neck-pendulum or NP, and pendulum-vehicle or PV joints). Ball-and- socket joints were defined between the head and neck and between the neck and pendulum. A pin joint was defined between the pendulum and the vehicle/ground (i.e., a rigid support). The geometric and inertial proper- ties of the segments and pendulum-vehicle joint char- acteristics were abstracted from operational data sets at the AAMRL, derived from Part 572 amended, or measured at the manikin lab at the AAMRL. The neck joint characteristics were derived from several sources. Experimental data were obtained from the AAMRL[5J, Prasad[6], and Deng[7j. This data is plotted in Figure 2 relative to the Mertz[11,12] cor- ridors. AAMRL measured both static and dynamic responses of the head-neck system; Prasad and Deng measured only the static response.

Flexion is shown in these plots in the upper left quadrant; extension is shown in the lower right quad- rant. Only the AAMRL and Seemann specify different mechanical properties for flexion and extension load- ing and different mechanical properties for the upper and lower neck joint. The AAMRL data set utilizes a relatively new feature of the ATB program code in order to model the asymmetric bending properties of the neck in the A-P plane. Different tabular stiffnesses are input for positive and negative bending at the HN and NP joints. One drawback of this feature is that it does not permit use of the energy dissipation algorithm. The AAMRL is planning to incorporate this feature into a later version of the code. The honeycomb was defined as a contact plane. The specified pendulum strike plate acceleration-time his- tory was achieved by defining a plane-ellipsoid contact between the pendulum and honeycomb and force- deflection characteristics for that contact. Details of the pendulum-honeycomb contact definition have been described in an earlier paper[3j. Figures 4-5 show typical pendulum strike plate ac- celeration pulses for the flexion and extension tests, respectively.

The standard specifies the maximum deceleration level and the deceleration level ranges at 10, 20, and 30 msec. Note that the specified peak deceleration level (and initial velocity) are less for the extension test than for the flexion test. T o achieve the desired acceleration pulses, different impact velocities and honeycomb force-deflection properties were used for the flexion and extension tests. This difference is based on our actual pendulum testing experience. Typically, in addi- tion to utilizing a different drop height, the required number of honeycomb cells impacted by the pen- dulum and honeycomb precrush varies for different sample lots and for the different directions of loading. Simulations were performed of the impact phase, where time zero was the time just prior to pendulum- honeycomb contact. The initial conditions were the positions and velocities of the segments, which were calculated from the specified pendulum strike plate impact velocity. The vehicle was stationary thoroughout all of the simulations. SIMULATION RESULTS Four data sets were developed based upon model parameters published by the AAMRL, Deng, Seemann, and Wismans. Simulations of the Amended Part 572 flexion and extension compliance tests were per- formed with these data sets. Plots of model responses are compared to compliance test specifications and experimental data. The boxes and solid horizontal lines in these plots illustrate the compliance test specifica- tions. The curves labeled TRC were digitized from published experimental compliance test data from TRC of Ohio[13]. The remaining curves are the model predictions. Flexion Test Results. The flexion test was simulated. Figure 6 is a plot of the D-plane (HP) rotation vs. time. Figure 7 is a plot of the moment at the occipital con- dyles vs. time. Differences were observed between the various model predictions and the compliance test requirements and experimental results. Extension Test Results. The extension test was simu- lated. Figure 8 is a plot of the D-plane rotation vs. time. Figure 9 is a plot of the moment at the occipital con- dyles vs. time. The various model predictions for the HN moment differ little from one another; the mag- nitudes comply with specifications but the zero cross- ings are early. The D-plane response predictions differ more significantly from the specifications and from one another. 673</page><page sequence="6">100 I 1 1 1 100 I ļ- I 1 i I 80 - fT X^Wismans _ | 80 " TRC nTPv yDen9 &amp; /'//¿r^' v^^^wismans i 60 - /ź^x'/yTRC nTPv i 60 - //V~x'''''^AAMRL - § / f~"' ' /ySeemann c X/ V, '*ií ^Seemann « 40 // ''&lt;yA/AAMRL I . // 'XC/Den0 - I « - 40 ■ / // ''&lt;yA/AAMRL m ' ■!••-/ I . // 'XC/Den0 W - ■ * 0 ' ' '-' ~ ? 0 ' - - û ' ' ' ' û '' ' -20 1 1 ^ 1 A ^ -20 ' 1 1 ^ - 1 - ^ 0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Time (msec) Time (msec) Figure 6: D-Plane Rotation (Flexion) Figure 8: D-Plane Rotation (Extension) 1200 I 1 1 1000 Xl' ^ rn' ^.Seemann ^ t 800 - ,¡PbfiCXAfÍÍRL * ¿ eoo 600 - - £ eoo 600 - l¡¡¡ VVX^T-trc I 400 - l m mr I 1 »&gt; - / /7 Kv * 1 / / * -200 1 J ^ 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) 200 - 1 1 x7 i pk ® W / 'j/ ą W AC - "20° ~ W '' /7XTRC Deng ® ''V' //C^ Deng E -400 - '''' //T^-Wismans ^ X'T RV^AAMRL I -600 V%c7 /''^^"Seemann 7.P -800 ' 1 1 1 - 0 50 100 150 200 Time (msec) Figure 7: Head-Neck Moment (Flexion) Figure 9: Head-Neck Moment (Extension) 674</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARY ATB data sets of the Hybrid III manikin head-neck system were studied. The Amended Part 572 Head- Neck Pendulum Compliance Test, of the Code of Federal Regulations, was simulated to validate these data sets. Differences were observed between the various model predictions and the compliance test requirements and experimental results. RECOMMENDATIONS The following are recommendations for future work: 1 . Conduct parameterizations to assess the effects of changes In neck joint characteristics upon the model responses. 2. Modify the program source code to incorporate energy dissipation for the tabular stiffness input option. 3. Tune the Hybrid III data sets based on the results of these studies and parameterization results. Validate that proposed data set using lower velocity pendulum tests. 4. Continue tuning the proposed Hybrid III data set by additional validation studies. The Amended Part 572 pendulum test assesses the validity of the flexion-extension bending parameters of the Hybrid III head-neck structure. Next, the axial, lateral, and torsional properties of the system should be studied. Vertical acceleration or sled tests could be used to determine the neck axial stiffness and damping. Other test modes could be utilized to derive values for the torsional stiffness and damping of the neck. 5. Compare dummy responses with human volunteer and cadaver data to assess the blofidelity of these systems in test modes other than flexion and ex- tension. 6. Develop and validate data sets of human and other mechanical head-neck systems.
