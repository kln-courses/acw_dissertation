<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA By PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT HOW far can we divest ourselves of paleface preconcep tions and enter imaginatively into the primeval world view from which, by successive refinements, disavowals^ and reorientations, the later phenomena of human thought have lumberingly evolved? The divestment will be partial and dub ious at best; for when once the virus of civilization has thor oughly infected us?for better and for worse?our tribal habits of conceptualization stubbornly assert themselves as of universal validity. The result is an ingrained partisanship, which renders myopic the backward look, and encourages a sort of snobbery toward earlier peoples in proportion as their ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving differ radically from our own. The bare fact that undergraduate courses in "primitive cultures" have come to occupy a strategic place in modern college curricula is no guarantee that our understanding of the primitive condition has been correspondingly deepened. What is meant by "primitive"? Do we prejudge important issues by playing fast and loose with the word? Is it simply a verbal stopgap of ignorance, an omnibus-symbol for societal types on which it pleases our pride to look with condescension? Admittedly there are real obstacles to an objective study of cul tural primitivity. If we collect data from among proto-civilized peoples of today, there is first the difficulty of finding tribal specimens any longer uncontaminated by civilizing influences; second, the difficulty of overcoming radical language barriers and sly native reticence to achieve real communication regarding perennial matters; and third, the unanswerable doubt whether these contemporary so-called primitives?even where we can</page><page sequence="2">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 575 find them and understand them?are truly primitive in the sense of preserving custom and belief intact since before the beginning of recorded history. If, on the other hand, our data are taken from the earliest literary remains of ancient peoples, there are (besides interpretative difficulties of another kind) haunting in dications of long prior ages, of which even the most venerable writings are late after-products and therefore imperfect records. Such obstacles, faced candidly, would be formidable if the ob ject of search were the primitive in a strictly chronological sense. There is no real knowledge of how men thought, felt, and acted ten thousand or fifty thousand years ago. Fortunately, how ever, there does not need to be. Any such time-spans are arbi trary. Mankind's primitive condition had no assignable begin ning and end. Besides, an interest in what the earliest men were like, even if it could be satisfied, is more antiquarian than philo sophical. Primitivity in its most relevant sense is a character to be recognized not by its when but by its what. Out of both of the two great systems of evidence conjoined?those furnished by "uncivilized" peoples of today, or rather of two or three gen erations ago before their molestation had proceeded to such destructive lengths, and those furnished by ancient documents and supplemented by archeological exhumations?there emerges a picture of the human condition which, regardless of how far back into pre-history it may or may not refer, is firmly signifi cant both because, with abundant deviations, it is so well-nigh universal, and because it stirs even in our minds today some dim response of recognition. The primitive world-view has so many facets?magic and legend, totem and taboo, initiation ceremonies and death chants, worship of gods and ghosts, and many others?that anything like full treatment here is out of the question. A simplification is required, and it must be one that without distorting the main data and main emphases which anthropological science discloses as typically primitive, will be sufficiently relevant to our present 3</page><page sequence="3">576 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA semantic inquiry to throw light upon the nature of the expressive symbol. Such a simplification is found in the fundamental pair of cultural phenomena: ritual and myth. Ritual connotes a way of doing, and myth a way of envisaging; but the doing and the envisaging are of a special, not of an everyday sort, and im ply in their turn a belief in a penumbral reality, something extending beyond yet interpenetrating with the affairs of mortal men. Now doing and envisaging bring into play the two most basic types of imagery contributing to human experience?namely, the kinaesthetic and the visual. By these the substance of our world is largely given. Discovery and interpretation play back and forth through them both, in varying combination, as the case of an infant exploratively exercising its muscular reflexes to reach toward an object which it sees will conform. Kinaesthesis and vision?the Nietzschean Dionysus and Apollo?are the two most indispensable and typical ingredients of the human situation at whatever level of advancement. If Hindu seer or Christian saint can sometimes virtually subdue his motor-impulses to emancipate the beatific vision in its purity, that is a brilliant ex ception which does not invalidate the rule. Again, if an occas ional creative musical genius can experience pure tone as the main area of reference in his world (analogously, perhaps, to a dog's reliance upon odors), still for most persons musical sounds are adjectival appendages of "the real world" rather than its very substance. The eye and the muscle normally come first. And when they function on the human as distinguished from the merely animal level they tend to assume (as Susanne K. Langer has persuasively argued) a symbolic role in addition to their practical one. In man qua animal, sight and behavior are little more than phases of a predictable reflex-circuit: they sim ply are. But in man qua man, vision and action become en joyed, furthered, and controlled for their own sake; developed</page><page sequence="4">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 577 into visual imaginings, story-telling, legend and myth on the one hand, and into gesture and ritual on the other. The mythopoeic vision involves a certain idea of nature; for a myth, whatever its undertones of psychic extrapolation, tells a story whose locale is the world "out there." What is the primi tive world-out-there? The answer must reckon on ambivalence. In part the primitive man's world is an extension of his com munity-sense, which is to say it is continuous with his own tribal existence and therefore something familiar, with which he is in congenital attunement; in part it is starkly and awefully differ ent from himself, and potentially hostile. The distinction marks roughly a difference between two kinds of ritual: celebrative or sacramental, and magical?ritual expressing joy in the attune ment, and ritual seeking to exploit the otherness or defend against the hostility. But no sooner is the distinction made than qualifications suggest themselves. In many instances of ritual the elements of sacrament and of magic are so closely joined as to be hardly distinguishable; and both elements lose their proper character as ritual lapses into rote. Moreover, while magic is primarily a technique of controlling?i.e., either exploiting or exorcising?the otherness of nature, the operation involves (as Frazer and others have shown) a strong sense of affinity, an ef fective identity of life-power, between the operator and the portion of nature to be magically controlled. For nature, mythopoeically envisaged, is subject to what L?vy-Bruhl has called "the law of participation." Admitting the difficulty of formulating the law adequately, he suggests that "in the collective representations of primitive mentality, ob jects and phenomena can be, though in a manner incomprehen sible to us, at once themselves and not themselves." Thus when the Bororo tribe of northern Brazil declare that they are red parakeets, they are not merely taking a name or claiming a re lationship; they are asserting positive identity with the species of red parakeet. On the basis of our accustomed logic?the</page><page sequence="5">578 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA logic of Literal Discourse?it is paradoxical to regard them as human beings and as birds of scarlet plumage at the same time, but "to the mentality that is governed by the law of participa tion there is no difficulty in the matter." L?vy-Bruhl character izes such mentality as "pre-logical" : not implying that it is necessarily antecedent in time to the birth of logical thought, but merely "that it does not bind itself down, as [logical] thought does, to avoiding contradiction." In practical situations, he observes, a primitive man reasons much as we would do: seeking shelter in a storm and a way of escape on encountering a wild beast?where he has to think and act as an individual. Typically primitive "pre-logical" ideas do not depend on the individual but on the group: "they present themselves in aspects which cannot be accounted for by considering individuals merely as such; they cannot be deduced from the laws of a psychology based upon the analysis of the individual subject." L?vy-Bruhl calls them "collective representations." Now the law of participation operates not only in combining concepts, but?when they are collective representations?in the very manner of their formation. Our familiar concepts?man, animal, organism, and the like?involve judgmental operations of which we are scarcely aware: in particular, the operations of remembering similar instances, of judging what similarities are relevant, and of grouping the instances into classes on the basis of those similarities. Collective representations, too, involve mental selection and synthesis, but along different lines from such concepts as we call logical. The collective representations "contain, as integral parts, affective and motor elements, and above all they imply, in the place of our conceptual inclusions or exclusions, participations which are more or less clearly de fined, but as a general rule, very vividly sensed." Thus a por trait to the primitive mind is different from what it is to ours. The Sioux chieftains would not let Catlin take their portrait, fearing that whatever happened to their likenesses, delivered</page><page sequence="6">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 579 over into strange hands, would equally happen to themselves. But how interpret this well-known sort of native shyness? Fra zer's learned but comparatively superficial analysis assumes that a primitive man sees a portrait just as we do but holds different beliefs about its magical efficacy, and therefore has different feelings about it. L?vy-Bruhl's analysis is more adequate. He understands that feelings and beliefs, when they go deep, affect the nature of the seeing; and that to the primitive consciousness a portrait is not a distinct thing related to its original by simi larity, but actually participates in its nature, properties, and life. The unwillingness to have the chieftains' picture taken was shared equally by all the tribe; for by virtue of the same law of participation the tribe's welfare and very existence depend upon the condition of its chieftains, living or dead. The chief tains merge ontologically with their portrait on the one hand and with their human subjects on the other: in mythopoeic per spective there are no clear-cut atoms of existence. Things flow, in varying degrees and according to the emotional character of each occasion, into other things. Participation implies a partial but thoroughly real identity, a transcendence of either-or, an ontological tangency by which things empirically distinct blend into oneness. Sociologists have usefully popularized the Melanesian word mana to denote the mysterious and potent vital force which primitive man accepts as present to different degrees in all things. But the sociological interpretation makes mana some thing purely fictional?"mythical" rather than "mythic"?repre senting a mistaken belief about the nature of things, which pro duces the pseudo-utilitarian form of behavior which is magic. But if with a patient effort of empathetic imagination we are willing to think ourselves into the primitive milieu, we must re nounce, at least temporarily, our all too smug assurance of know ing where fact leaves off and fiction begins. The effort must be one of intellectual hospitality, a willingness to explore the hy</page><page sequence="7">580 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA pothesis that mana may be not just a fanciful (i.e., "mythical") superstition of ignorant primitives, but something absolutely primal, which (paraphrasing J. S. Mill) I may define function ally as the permanent possibility of genuinely mythic experience. It is as open today as ever before; but only to those with the knack of "becoming as little children"; and the childlike per spective suffers doubly from dispersion by the engines of tech nological living and from ridicule by the snobbery of sophisti cated thinking. Mana is a borderland idea, whose mode of ex istence lies between the personal and impersonal, between the natural and supernatural, and between the subjective and ob jective. That is not to say, of course, that primitive man first thinks these antitheses and then compromises between them, but simply that he does not make the distinctions which appear logi cally and experientially axiomatic to us moderns. By virtue of the last of the three borderland characteristics that I have men tioned, i.e., its undifferentiated hovering between subjective and objective actuality (if such philosophical language is not indeed grossly inappropriate to so primitive a situation), mana is at once the agency and the expression (I do not see how the paradox can be avoided) of man's participation in living nature. Vital force communicates itself?that is to say, the law of par ticipation, or of natural sympathy, is at work?in three principal ways. Frazer discusses two of them, similarity and previous contact, but he overlooks, or at least does not explicitly classify, a third: the power of complementaries. Daily experience testi fies that we are not only stirred by similars, we can be chal lenged by contraries. Mozart wrote some of his gayest melo dies when suffering from penury, illness, and depression; and it is said that Wagner was in a more cheerful mood when he wrote Tristan than when he composed his one comedy, Die Meistersinger. The human tendency to be moved by opposition is not merely behavioral; it enters deeply into the human epis</page><page sequence="8">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 581 temic, which is to say, it is constitutive of man's basic ways of envisaging reality. Now this tendency toward association by complementaries, or opposites, throws light upon a pervasive element in man's primal relationship with nature. The element of participation and sympathy, of kinship between society and nature, is not the whole story. It is complemented by a lurking sense of nature's otherness, strangeness, and lurking hostility. The typically primitive attitude toward nature is largely a tension between familiarity and watchfulness. The former gives stability and confidence, a feeling of membership, of at-homeness, of being comfortably rooted in Mother Earth. The security of the cave, of the family, and subconsciously perhaps of the womb, sup plies the primordial ground-plan of human living. Familiar localities, persons, objects, and events confirm the basic sense of belonging; as do the patterned festivities of seasonal and tribal occurrence. But the familiar is not all of life, and to bask in it exclusively is to approach the condition of vegetable. Man encounters also, and develops a readiness to encounter, the strange; and this readiness in turn has a double aspect. For the strange can alarm and it can fascinate: it is likely to do both at once, and the two emotions in combination?terror subdued by wonder?produces awe. Where the effect is more intriguing than frightening, men see fetishes in pebbles, spirits in rocks and rivers, totem-brothers in beasts, and gods in the sun and mountain-tops. Where the note of alarm predominates, and where it is not definite enough to arouse the self-preservative instincts by suggesting particular measures of defense?the un guessable menace of hurricane and earthquake, of black night and bottomless pool, of the snake's beady stare and the tiger's sinewy power?in such cases man's imaginative awareness falls into a primal terror of the strange as such, i.e., of the Wholly Other. The primordial awe and sometimes dread of nature in its</page><page sequence="9">582 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA guise of the Wholly Other, which a highly intellectualized ver sion of the world allows a majority of contemporary men to escape or ignore, is at the very heart of the primitive world view. The tension which it creates in the primitive psyche, and less consciously but still effectively in the psyche of everyone, demands release. There are uncontrolled forms of release, such as hysteria, trances, and running amok: disturbances which it is the business of the medicine man, the shaman, to cure?perhaps by some transference of mana, perhaps by exorcism of the evil spirit causing the disturbance. But far more significant is the substitution of tribally shared rhythms for individual anarchic ones. Effective defense against alien reality is communal; only where there is vigorous imaginative independence combined with tough moral courage can it be individual. Submersion in tribal ways of thinking, feeling, speaking and doing have always been man's handiest remedy for cosmic loneliness and terror of the dark unknown. Even today communal response tends to involve an element of "thobbing together"?whether to the same journalistic clich?s or to the same juke-box syncopations. In primitive so ciety the collective thobbing is more deliberately stylized, and man's instinctive defense against the Wholly Other finds em bodiment in ceremonial. Because the thobbing together of primitive ceremonial represents not only an experiential togeth erness of man with man but also of man taken collectively with his world, and because Praxis and Theoria, the way of doing and the way of envisaging, are inextricable at bottom and mu tually interacting, the primitive world has for its primitive ob server a more strongly rhythmic time-character than our world has for us. Time, in modern perspective, splits into subjective and objective?into the freely flowing dur?e of private reverie and the postulated uniform time by which we set our watches and mark our calendars. Utilitarian necessities dichotomize it. Moreover, our public and measurable time, as Bergson has</page><page sequence="10">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 583 demonstrated, is inescapably space-oriented?the more so in pro portion as it is conceived with scientific rigor. Whatever sur realist realignments and combinations of the space and time cate gories may be found in post-Einsteinian physics, the unassailable evidence of the Instrument proves that space and not time is the ultimate fulcrum of physico-scientific reference. For even the time-hypotheses of physics are tested by "readings" on some kind of chronometer, and the readings are visual?which is to say, what they immediately report are discriminations of space, which can be seen, and not of time, which cannot. The primi tive, by contrast, assigns equal ontologie reality to time as ex perienced?in the succession of day and night and the cycle of the seasons, in the progress from childhood to maturity and from maturity to old age and death, and in the tribal calendar of ceremonies appropriate to planting, reaping, feasting, war, the hunt, adolescent initiation, marriage, sacrifice, and the like. Na ture, in mythopoeic perspective, is cyclical; it exhibits vitally periodic, as opposed to mechanically regulated, becoming. Mythopoeic periodicity is more richly qualitative than the periodicities recognized by the scientizing mind of today. It takes many forms, of which anthropologists have sometimes singled out one or another for special attention. In my review in the Spring issue of this journal I outlined Theodor Gaster's theory of the four phases of seasonal ritual, and of the import ance of seasonal ritual as the matrix of drama. His analysis is highly pertinent, and neither anthropologists nor dramatologists can afford to ignore it. Nevertheless there is, I judge, a more general character of primitive ritual, of which the drama of the death and rebirth of the vegetation god is a particular though very basic exemplification. That character, in the theory of the anthropologist Arnold van Gennep, is the total experience, in which man and nature harmoniously join, of transition. (Van Gennep uses the French word passage.) Every change of hu man condition?birth, puberty, initiation, betrothal, marriage,</page><page sequence="11">584 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA pregnancy, paternity, specialization of occupation, death?is my thopoeically regarded as a passage from a state of self that is dying to a state of self newly born. Such events do not merely happen to an individual on the outside, they change the very thing he is. Again and again primitive literature draws an analogy between an individual's passage from state to state and a worm's metamorphosis into a moth. In the world of physical nature, too, there are demarcations and periods of passage?steps forward and relatively static periods of suspension. Moreover, such alternations of movement and rest as there may be are ac centuated and dramatized by ritual so that mythopoeically they stand out as fundamental characteristics of the primitive world ?as happens particularly in the ceremonies of the full moon celebrating the passage from month to month, in those of the solstices and equinoxes celebrating the passage from season to season, as well as in vegetation ceremonies, which are frequently timed according to astronomical phenomena. Primitive cere monies of human transition have a tendency to blend with those pertaining to cosmic transition: another working of the "law of participation." Consequently it is often impossible to say, with out falsifying the situation, whether a given ceremonial pertains to a change in human state or to a recurrent change in nature, just as it is often impossible to say how far it is magical and how far celebrative. Here again the logical "either-or" cannot be pressed too far. Instead of Gaster's four, Van Gennep distinguishes three stages in the typical "ceremonies of transition" (rites de pass age): the rites of separation, those of "the margin" when the celebrant finds himself in the darkness and anonymity of "be tween two worlds," and those of attainment. Here, for in stance, is the probable sequence of rites of initiation at ancient Eleusis, which van Gennep bases largely upon the Eleusinian researches of Foucart: 1. The candidates and the hierophant are separated by a taboo</page><page sequence="12">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 585 from those who have impure hands and who talk in an unin telligible manner?i.e., unintelligible by the standards of the new light of wisdom that is to be won. 2. The neophytes are introduced into the Eleusinion, but be fore penetrating the enclosure (P* enceinte) they must purify themselves with a vase of holy water placed next to the door. 3. The neophytes are led to the shore of the sea, wherein, accompanied by Demeter's sacred animal the pig, they take a ritual bath, to be washed clean of their earlier "profane" and impure life. 4. They return to Eleusis in a holy procession, carrying the Bacchus figure and other sacred objects to various places of agrarian worship en route. 5. Re-entering into the enclosure of the Eleusinion they un dergo the ceremony of initiation, which, although not known to us in full detail, appears to have included at least the following steps: traveling across a hall divided into dark compartments representing the regions of Hades; climbing a stair; entry into the great hall where the sacra (among which the sacred ear of corn had prominence) were exhibited; a representation of the abduction of Kore (both in her general aspect of untarnished maidenhood and in her particular aspect as Persephone, whose mother the grain goddess Demeter was the patron deity of Eleusis). 6. Finally there were dances, processions, and other cere monial forms of rejoicing. Although I have slightly simplified van Gennep's account, I have kept the order of events as he gives it, and his interpreta tion of the testimony of ancient writers appears to be sound. Evidently the first three stages represent rites of separation, probably the fourth and certainly the fifth are rites of the mar gin, and the sixth comprises rites of attainment. But a different light is thrown upon the relationship when Gaster's categories are substituted: Stage 1 then represents Mortification, Stages 2</page><page sequence="13">586 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA and 3 Purification, Stages 4 and 5 presumably Reinvigoration, and Stage 6 Jubilation. Some of the ceremonies at Eleusis?the washing, wandering in the dark, climbing the stair, and processional rejoicing?are found in different religions all over the world. The ritual dis play of a sacred animal and a sacred fruit of the earth are uni versal in general character and intent, although local conditions and traditions dictate what specific objects shall be used. But why the rape of Persephone? It is not enough to reply that Persephone was the daughter of Demeter and that Demeter was the goddess chiefly worshipped in the Eleusinian mysteries. Such an explanation makes the dubious assumption that the myth preceded the ritual, and does not explain how the myth itself arose. The real answer must be sought in the meaning of the archetype of the Kore (Divine Maiden) and of the myth of Persephone's rape. Let it be recalled that in the well-known myth the rape was followed by a famine, caused by Demeter's maternal grief which, by magical "participation," discouraged all crops from growing; but that by virtue of Demeter's descent into Hades an arrangement was effected with Dis, lord of the underworld, whereby Persephone could sojourn on the upper earth during certain months of the year, in which months there after growth could be restored. Of course the etiological aspect of the myth is clear and has often been remarked: as explaining allegorically why the earth is fruitful during some months and barren during others. That aspect is too unmistakable to be denied, but it is hardly the entire story. If it comprised the total meaning, any other incident provoking Demeter's grief or petulance might have served equally well. But why specifically a rape? Evidently because rape symbolizes one of the most im portant and emotionally arresting "passages" in human experi ence?the passage from the pure state of virginity through the shock of violation and attaining to the happy issue of periodic motherhood. Demeter's descent into Hades connects symboli</page><page sequence="14">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 587 cally the rape archetype with the even more universal archetype of death and life in alternation. The interrelation of ritual and symbolism shows up differently but most suggestively in the Night Chant ceremonies of the Navaho Indians. The focal object of the Night Chant is res toration of health to a patient or patients, although this central purpose is surrounded with prayers for abundant rains, good crops, long life, and happiness for all the people. "In this and other healing ceremonies," according to Washington Matthews ("The Night Chant," Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, 1902), "since the object is to guard against death and prolong life, it is important that a life element, or what appears to the Indian mind to be such, should be preserved as much as possible in all articles used." The life principle is preserved symbolically: feathers must be obtained from birds captured alive, and to secure them the Indian has to learn to steal upon the nest noiselessly by night. Pollen, which is to be sprinkled on the patient, must have its vital principle preserved by injecting live birds and other animals into it. The sacred buckskin, which is used for making thongs and in other ways during the healing ceremonies, must preserve the deer's life force: for which reason the animal must be slain without a wound, and its nostrils closed with pollen, so that a certain vital element remains even though the animal dies: one of its souls may depart, but not all. One of the chief purificatory agencies is the sacred sweat bath. As the patient proceeds into the sweat-house, to which white plumes have been affixed, the Song of the Rock is chanted: In the House of the Red Rock There I enter; Half way in I am come. The corn-plants shake.</page><page sequence="15">588 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA In the House of Blue Water, There I enter; Half way in I am come. The squash-vines shake. On a floor marked with symbolic designs in sacred pollen dust the patient sits on spruce twigs. When he has sweated in silence for some thirty minutes two medicine men approach with careful ceremony from the east, enacting the roles of two gods, and apply sacred wands with strong pressure to the essen tial parts of the patient's body. A further chant follows: At the Red Rock House it grows, There the giant corn-plant grows, With ears on either side it grows, With its ruddy silk it grows, Ripening in one day it grows, Greatly multiplying it grows. At the Blue Water House it grows, There the giant squash-vine grows, With fruit on either side it grows, With its yellow blossom it grows, Ripening in one night it grows, Greatly multiplying it grows. The pollen dust pictures are then ceremonially obliterated by being scraped from one end to the other?from head to foot when the figure is a stylized anthropomorph?and the dust from which they were constructed is gathered into a blanket and thrown away a certain number of paces north of the sweat house. During the sacred sweat-bath, while the evil is oozing out through the patient's pores, the strictest silence is enjoined upon him. To break silence is to lose all. There is a Navaho story of two boys, one a cripple, the other blind, who sought to be</page><page sequence="16">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 589 cured. As they entered the sweat-house, which was covered with curtains of blue cloud and mist and adorned on top with pictures of rainbow and lightning, they were strictly charged by the yei who conducted them that they must on no account talk. The lodge soon grew very hot and the boys began to perspire; presently the blind one became conscious of a faint light stream ing under the curtains and the cripple felt a stirring in his legs. Their joy was so great that they forgot the solemn warning. "Oh! younger brother," cried the one, "I see." "Oh! elder brother," cried the other, "I move my legs." In an instant the rainbow, the lightning, the curtain of cloud and mist, and the sweat-house itself vanished, and the boys were left sitting on the open ground with nothing but four stones beside them and the spruce-twigs under them, the one as blind, the other as lame as ever. The power of the story goes deeper than pathos, for what I may call the Archetype of the Vanishing Garden draws sus tenance from the unplumbed depths of our individual and col lective unconscious. Behaviorists have experimentally ascertained that loss of support, even in the plain physical sense, produces fright-reflexes independently of any association-conditionings. Dr. Suttee, using the methods of depth psychology, has traced the origins of many psychotic ailments to premature or over-vio lent "psychic weaning." The individual's tragic loss of the womb's security, re?nacted psychically at successive stages of childhood, has its mythic counterpart in the Garden of Eden story as well as in the broader Christian theme of mankind's continued self ejection or self-debarment from Paradise. Even the symbolism of silence, I would suggest, is adumbrated in the Eden myth. The tree of which our first parents ate, in defiance of Jehovah's command, was of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The Crea ture, not content with the bounty of the Tree of Life which is freely allowed him, dares to take good and evil into his own hands and to speak in his own way of primal matters, instead of</page><page sequence="17">590 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA bringing his mind and heart into the stillness of listening and thus into the harmony of universal rhythms. And there is yet a further parallel between the Navaho and Christian versions of paradise lost. The careless boys were upbraided by all the people for having by their untimely chatter broken the efficacy of the cure, not only for themselves but for all Navahos, who thenceforth would have to supplement the healing ritual with gifts. The primal sin, in both religions, infects the entire race; the sinner plays a representative role. The co-presence of the Vanishing Garden archetype and the red rock and handful of pollen dust imagery in one mythic pattern is of some interest to readers of The Waste Land and Four Quartets. The Waste Land tie-up is strengthened by the fact that the Navaho purificatory rites are at the same time likely to involve prayers for rain. The combination of self healing and weather-magic is most strikingly brought forth in the prayer to the Owl God, chanted to the accompaniment of ceremonial cigarette making. The cigarettes are rolled, placed, and collected according to strict ritualistic tradition, while the medicine-man by a symbolic gesture extracts pollen from the sun, then applies actual pollen to his own tongue and head and to the essential parts of the patient. The cigarette smoke is dedicated to the Owl God, while priest and patient chant a prayer for healing, which concludes as follows: Today my interior shall become cool. With my interior cool I will go forth. No longer sore I will go forth. Feeling light within I will go forth. Happily may I walk. Happily abundant dark clouds I desire. Happily abundant showers I desire. Happily abundant vegetation I desire. Happily abundant pollen I desire. May it be happy before me.</page><page sequence="18">PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT 591 May it be happy behind me. May it be happy below me. May it be happy above me. With it happy all around me may I walk. It is finished in beauty. It is finished in beauty. According to Gladys A. Reichard, the Navahos associate black tobacco, white corn, blue bean, and yellow squash with the four cardinal directions and sometimes represent them sty listically by a Maltese cross. Tobacco is so honored because to bacco smoke is classed as a food and considered equally as refreshing as corn, bean, and squash. Doubtless this judgment refers partly to the experience of refreshment which a few puffs of tobacco can bring, but partly also the smoke is iconically as sociated with clouds, hence with rain, hence with fruitfulness and bounty. Earth Woman and Sky Man originally created the world by puffing tobacco smoke. Again, tobacco is used in the composition of prayer-sticks, for it serves to keep them alight. The light of the prayer-stick and the light of the sun are evi dently taken as having an underlying connection, for there are ceremonies of ritual transference of the sun's light to the prayer stick by means of a crystal. And finally, tobacco is smoked in conclave both as a symbol of peace and as a means of insuring success in war. I have intended in these notes to bring together scattered data which might assist in an understanding of the mythopoeic outlook. The study of the mythos can contribute to the pro blems of literature?I mean its Urprobleme?in two ways. The interrelation of mythos with ritual (as Nietzsche and Gaster have shown) points to the development of dramatic structure, and can furnish a useful commentary on such basic dramaturgi cal analyses as Aristotle's Poetics and Francis Fergusson's The 4</page><page sequence="19">592 NOTES ON MYTHOPOEIA Idea of a Theatre. The other way, the study of how images and image-clusters function within a mythic context?the pluri semantic character of the tobacco smoke would be an instance? leads to a study of metaphor and hence to the very heart of poetic meaning. But both the one and the other of those in vestigations reach far beyond the appointed limits of this pro paedeutic essay.</page></plain_text>
