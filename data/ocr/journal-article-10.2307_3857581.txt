<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD AND THREE CONCEPTIONS OF THE CORPORATION Michael J. Phillips A6stract: Despite some exceptions, the business ethics literature on the moral responsibility of corporations does not emphasize a subject critical to that inquiry: the general nature of corporations. This article attempts to lessen the imbalance by describing three conceptions of the corporation that have been prominent in twentieth century legal theorizing, and by sketching their implications for the moral responsi- bility of corporations. These three conceptions, at least two of which have counterparts in the philosophical and organizational theory liter- ature, are the concession, aggreyate, and real entity theories. The article concludes that the real entity theory is the most plausible of the lot. At least under prevailing tests of moral responsibility, it then con- tends, corporations-as-real-entities are morally responsible for most of their members' actions. "Discussions of corporate responsibility," Virginia Held has observed, "often begin with analyses of what it means to say that a person is respon- sible, and then consider whether corporations can or cannot meet the criteria set forth for personal responsibility.''l In such discussions, corporations satisfying person-centered criteria qualify as "moral persons": entities that are subject to moral duties (and perhaps are bearers of moral rights as well). Tc determine whether corporations are moral persons, one would think, it is necessary to have some conception of their nature. Yet despite such conspic- uous exceptions as Peter French, Larry May, and Patricia Werhane,2 such inquiries hardly have dominated the business ethics literature on corporate moral personhood.3 Although some participants in the debate characterize corporations in various ways, only infrequently are those characterizations accompanied by supporting arguments and the consideration of alternative conceptions. The main theme of this article, then, is that it is difficult to decide whether corporations have moral responsibilities without first determining what cor- porations are. In developing this theme, I sketch three conceptions of the corporation that have dominated twentieth century American legal commen- tary, along with their implications for the debate about corporate moral responsibility. Legal writers mainly have used these conceptions as weapons in legal controversies. But with one possible exception, they are not legal concepts in themselves. In fact, they have counterparts in philosophy4 and (C)1992. Business Ethics Quarterly, Volume 2, Issue 4. ISSN 1052-1SOX. 0435-0459.</page><page sequence="2">436 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY organizational theory,S and no doubt appear elsewhere as well. After devel- oping these three conceptions and their implications, I attempt to determine which is superior. This last discussion, although ultimately somewhat incon- clusive, nonetheless points strongly in a certain direction. Background and Assumptions As the preceding remarks suggest, the presence or absence of corporate moral personhood determines whether corporations are subject to moral obligations and to blame for their failure to meet those obligations.6 Con- tributors to the debate on this question invariably seem to assume its signif- icance. But to those with consequentialist tendencies, this assumption is not clearly justified at first glance. If business ethics instruction and research exist mainly to affect business conduct and thus to advance some conception of the social good, it apparently does not matter whether corporations are moral persons and have moral obligations. Because natural persons obvi- ously have such obligations, getting business people to respect them would do the job and would render specifically corporate moral responsibility unnecessary. In some cases, however, the harm produced by corporate activ- ity may not be attributable to the fault of any specific person or persons.7 This phenomenon, which should be familiar to lawyers, is not merely the commonplace that organizational complexities make it difficult to deter- mine who is responsible for a particular corporate misdeed. Rather, in some cases no one may be at fault in any strict sense. For example, harm might result from the cumulation of many individual actions, each of them rela- tively blameless in itself. Or, as Michael B. Metzger has observed, "the source of the wrong [could be] internal bureaucratic failures rather than the deliberate act of any particular corporate employee or employees."8 If the law does not forbid such actions and if no specifically corporate moral obligations forbid them either, they might remain subject to no sanction. Because it would further complicate an already lengthy article, I will not consider whether or when corporate moral responsibility implies personal moral responsibility for the corporation's members. Some other questions that are central to the debate over corporate moral personhood get short shrift here as well. I do not consider whether, if corporations are moral persons, they have rights as well as duties. I also am somewhat arbitrary in my choice of standards for determining whether an entity is a moral person. Frequently those standards are intentionality and the ability to act.9 But as Larry May has observed, "[n]egligent fault is the fault condition most ap- propriate to the majority of cases with which a theory of corporate respon- sibility must deal.''lÂ° Much irresponsible corporate behavior, that is, involves the careless failure to avoid reasonably foreseeable risks of harm rather than a conscious purpose to cause such harm. In addition, some corporate misbehavior involves recklessness: conscious indifference to known likely harms. In this article, therefore, I require that, to be morally responsible for an</page><page sequence="3">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 437 action, an actor must have performed the action with: (1) a conscious pur- pose to realize it or its consequences, (2) actual knowledge of its nature or its consequences, or (3) reason to know its nature or its consequences.ll For present purposes, an "act" or "action" is a deed that takes place in the physical world and that may have physical consequences. Moral persons, then, are entities having the capacity to perform acts with any of the three accompaniments just listed. I adopt such natural person-centered standards even though I am uncertain whether they are appropriate for corporations. As Held has observed, "'[r]esponsibility' may be something which is quite different for corporations than it is for individual persons, and applying a notion of responsibility worked out for individual persons to corporate en- tities, whatever they are, may be the wrong way to approach the questions we want to ask.''l2 She may well be right. Here, however, my main concern is to explore the nature of corporations as this bears on their moral person- hood. Even to attempt that exploration within a relatively short space, I must hold one variable constant, so to speak. Three Conceptions of the Corporation and their Implications The Concession Theory According to the standard legal definition, a corporation is an artificial person created by state law. As Chief Justice John Marshall elaborated the matter in 1819: "A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it ...."13 This legal definition expresses the concession theory: the view that a corporation depends upon state law for its existence and is solely a creation of that law. 14 Because the state and only the state breathes life into a corporation, it has no "real" existence apart from state law and is appro- priately regarded as an artificial entity. Throughout its up-and-down history in American law, the concession theory has frequently been used by those desiring greater government regulation of corporations. These people have argued that because corporations are creatures of state law, the states can control their activities as they wish; and that because states give corpora- tions privileges such as limited shareholder liability, corporations owe states duties in return.l5 But while the concession theory may be useful in rationalizing legal reg- ulation of corporate misbehavior, it cannot justify imposing moral obliga- tions on corporations. Milton Friedman recognized this in his famous 1970 New York Times Magazine piece. 'SWhat does it mean," he argued, 'sto say that 'business' has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities. A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial responsibilities, but 'business' as a whole cannot be said to have responsi- bilities, even in this vague sense.''l6 If the concession theory properly describes corporations, Friedman almost</page><page sequence="4">438 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY certainly was right. Under that theory, corporations are artificial, state-cre- ated entities, and nothing else. For that reason, they have 4'no pants to kick or soul to damn,s'l7 and fail to meet the tests of moral responsibility dis- cussed earlier. Because corporations as conceived by the concession theory have no physical existence, it is difficult to see how they can act in the required sense. Although the law allows corporations to "act" through their agents, this is true only for legal purposes such as the impositton of liability. As Manuel Velasquez has neatly summarized the matter, "[p]eople who hold corporations morally responsible for their acts have in mind real agents that exert physical causality upon the world independently of the law.ss18 More importantly because an artificial person presumably lacks con- sciousness, how can it form intentions, or know or have reason to know about actions and their consequencesv To be sure, the law routinely imputes mental states to corporations and holds them liable for failing to avoid reasonably foreseeable harms, but this again is for legal purposes only. Such imputations, in other words, cannot- and are not intended to create the conditions of moral responsibility. The Aggregate Theory Although the Goncession theory has long since been abandoned by lawyers who theorize about corporations,l9 it may have approximated social and legal reality during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This was the era of special charters, when corporate existence depended on a specific grant from the legislature, such grants were consldered one-by-one, corporations were created mainly for public purposes and were relatively few} and corporations also were strictly limited to the purposes stated in their charters.20 In this environment, it may have been plausible to view corporations as creatures of the state and little else. However, with the emergence of general incorporation statutes throughout the nineteenth cen- tury5 the concession theory began to lose touch with reality.2l To be sure, corporate existence still required a charter (now almost universally called a certificate of lncorporation). But incorporation gradually became a fairly mechanical process in which state discretion was minimized and creating corporations was fairly easy*22 In addition, the ultra vires doctrine and other corporation law-based restrictions on corporate powers began their long slide into insignificance.23 These developments meant that what corporations did was determined less by state direction than by private initiative. Thus, it probably is unsur- prising that some late-nineteenth century theorists began to view corpora- tions as the product of free private agreement.24 Eventually such theorizing developed into the aggregate theory of the corporationv Although the con- stituents that are aggregated vary what unites all versions of this theory is the view that groups such as corporations are nothing more than collections of smaller basic units. Robert Hessens for example, has maintained that "[ejvery organization, regardless of its legal form or features5 consists only</page><page sequence="5">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 439 of individuals.... The term corporation actually means a group of individ- uals who engage in a particular type of contractual relationship with each other."25 Also, corporations so conceived lack any properties not possessed by the units themselves. In other words, group behavior is in principle explainable from the characteristics of the group's constituents.26 Indeed, on this view there is no separate corporate entity as such, and references to such entities are merely metaphorical. To Hessen, for example, "[a] group or association is only a concept, a mental construct, used to classify different types of relationships among individuals."27 As the quotations from Hessen suggest, according to the aggregate theory the most important constituents of corporations are human beings. Although some accounts focus on shareholders,28 there is no reason to ignore the directors, officers, employees, and other people who form the firm. Also, because the collectivities we call corporations seem to have nonhuman as well as human elements, aggregate theorists sometimes include additional components besides human beings. These include the contracts that form the corporation, other relationships within it, the various intracorporate posi- tions its members fill, and the corporationbs internal rules.29 Such accounts also may incorporate the concession theory by making the corporation's status as a legal fiction one element in the aggregate.30 In addition, sometimes the component human beings described by aggre- gate theorists are not flesh-and-blood people, but the utility-maximizing rational actors of economic theory. This is true of the 'Snexus-of-contracts'' theory of corporations recently advanced by economists and law-and-eco- nomics scholars.3l As one observer has described this theory, it "conceives of the firm as nothing more or less than the product of individual actors freely contracting according to their own utility calculations"32 And an- other portrays those individuals as "rational economic actors denuded of significant human characteristics."33 The new nexus-of-contracts approach also Sidenies the existence of a meaningful corporate entity."34 For this reason it and aggregate theory in general cannot support the imposition of moral responsibility on corpora- tions. If there is no separate corporate entity, there is nothing to serve as the bearer of distinctively corporate moral obligations.35 A nonexistent entity cannot act; neither can it form intentions or have knowledge or reason to know anything. It might be asserted in reply that the corporate entity at least has a metaphorical existence, but how can moral responsibility be imposed on a metaphor? According to the aggregate theory, therefore, only individual officers, employees, or other agents can be morally responsible for 'Scorpo- rate" misdeeds, and that responsibility should be determined under the nor- mal standards applicable to natural persons. The Real Entity Theory About the time legal scholars started propagating the aggregate theory, structural changes in the American economy began to render that theory less</page><page sequence="6">440 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY plausible than it had been earlier. Those changes, of course, concern the emergence of truly large corporations late in the nineteenth century. In an environment dominated by such groups, individuals can come to seem in- significant as individuals, and the groups themselves can come to appear as self-subsisting realities. Thus it is unsurprising that beginning around 1890, some legal scholars began to argue that corporations are real entities and not mere aggregations of their human components.36 The emergence of this real entity theory triggered a debate over the nature of the corporation that lasted through the 1920s but died out after that.37 However, with the recent arrival of the nexus-of-contracts approach, the debate may be beginning anew. The real entity theory asserts that corporations are actual, existing entities, and not just artificial creations of state law. Also, such entities are regarded as having properties separate from or exceeding those possessed by their summed human parts.38 Within the law, Morton Horwitz has argued, the real entity theory has generally tended "to legitimate large-scale enterprise and to destroy any special basis for state regulation of the corporation that derived from its creation by the state."39 It also is broadly consistent with the managerialism and the corresponding diminution of shareholder powers that constitute the well-known separation of ownership from control.40 Be- cause the theory tended to free management from shareholders' pecuniary demands by treating managers as agents of a distinct corporate entity, it also afforded them a theoretical opportunity to engage in socially responsible behavior.4l Our present concern, however, is with the real entity theory's implications for corporate moral personhood. Earlier we saw that specifically corporate moral responsibilities are impossible under the aggregate theory because there is no corporate entity to bear those responsibilities. But if corporations are real entities, at least this objection to their moral personhood is over- come. Determining whether corporations have moral duties, however, also requires that they can act and that they can be culpable in any of the three senses described previously. This, in turn, forces us to consider what kind of entity the real entity theory describes. Unfortunately, the answers to this question have varied tremendously. Some observers apparently regard a corporation as a real entity, but not the sort of entity that can qualify as a moral person. In 1911, for example, the legal writer Arthur Machen argued that corporations are real entities because words referring to collectivities do not mean the same thing as words denoting the sum of the collectivity's constituents, but also argued that corporations so conceived are not persons because they are not rational beings.42 In a well-known 1970 essay, John Ladd seemed to treat corpora- tions and other organizations as real entities by describing them as imper- sonal decision-making structures that resemble machines, but denied that they have moral responsibilities because the language-game of their deci- sions contains no such terms.43 Recently Michael Keeley has propounded a social-contract theory of organizations that, despite its title, appears to deny the aggregate theory and to affirm that organizations have some kind of</page><page sequence="7">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 441 independent identity.44 But this identity is insufficiently rich to give groups intentions, interests, rights, and duties of their own.45 In recent years, however, several philosophers have asserted that corpora- tions indeed are moral persons.46 The most frequently discussed of these, Peter French, probably regards corporations as real entities,47 and bases corporate agency and intentionality on the presence of an internal decision- making structure (or CID structure) whose operations are describable in terms of actions and intentions.48 In this space, I cannot even begin to detail French's theory and the many attacks it has received.49 Perhaps the most telling of those attacks is the claim that moral responsibility requires an agent with a genuine consciousness, not one whose activity merely is de- scribable in intentional terms.50 Whatever the overall merits of French's theory, then, his case for corpo- rate moral responsibility remains controversial. What versions of the real entity theory, if true, might clearly justify such responsibility? Horwitz provides a hint when he observes that after 1900 American adherents to the theory had access to a portion of a history of German legal associations written by Otto Gierke and translated by the British legal historian Frederic William Maitland. The parts of Gierke's book that appear in Maitland's translation, while expressing some corporativist sentiments, do not strike me as especially useful for present purposes. Maitland's introduction, how- ever, is another matter. At one point he describes Gierke's "German Fellow- ship" as: [N]o fiction, no symbol, no piece of the State's machinery, no collective name for individuals, but a living organism and a real person, with body and members and a will of its own. Itself can will, itself can act; it wills and acts by the men who are its organs as a man wills and acts by brain, mouth and hand. It is not a fictitious person; it is a GesaJIlsltperson, and its will is a Gesazlllzltwille; it is a group-person, and its will is a group-will.Sl Here corporations are real entities that pretty clearly qualify as moral per- sons under the tests described previously. Maitland/Gierke's fellowship is a "real person" capable of real acts. Because it is a person with a "group-will" of its own, it presumably is capable of forming intentions, and of knowing or having reason to know about those acts and their consequences. In any event, "the men who are its organs" and who act for it should have these capacities. Evaluating the Three Conceptions Commenting on the turn-of-the-century legal debate about the nature of the corporation, Horwitz remarks that "[t]he argument between entity and contractual theorists . . . was, at bottom, a conflict over whether the individ- ual or the group was the appropriate unit of economic, political, and legal analysis.''S2 As should be evident, the argument also is central to the debate over corporate moral personhood. The following discussion of that question is only tentative and exploratory. Nonetheless, I like to think that it goes</page><page sequence="8">442 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY some way toward undermining the aggregate theory and establishing a ver- sion of the real entity theory sufficiently full-bodied to support corporate moral responsibility in many instances. Before considering those subjects, however, I must briefly return to a subject deservedly ignored by Horwitz's comment. The Concession Theory Earlier we saw that if the concession theory adequately characterizes corporations, they cannot be moral persons. The key term here, however, is "adequately." That is, if the theory is to be useful to foes of corporate moral responsibility, it must express virtually the only truth about corporations. In other words, it must exclude any factors that might be conditions of corpo- rate moral personhood. To me, any such exclusion is utterly arbitrary. By declaring corporations state-created artificial legal persons and nothing else, that is, the concession theory abstracts violently from the range of phenomena we normally asso- ciate with the term 'corporation.' As Jeffrey Nesteruk has noted, *'[t]he difficulty with viewing the corporation simply as a creation of the state is that the state no longer functions as the dominant force in the development of a corporation's form and character."53 It is for this reason, I think, that the theory ceased to reflect social reality over a century ago, and that few legal scholars who theorize about corporations take it seriously today. The concession theory retains one of the modern corporation's least significant features, while casting off aspects of corporate life that are much more important. It elevates the formalism of incorporation over matters such as corporation's various members, products or services, formal and informal structure, overall ethos, offices, plant, and much more. In describing what a corporation is, it asserts, the sovereign's concession is all that matters, and these other phenomena simply do not count. To illustrate the strange conclu- sions this misemphasis forces upon us, suppose that the XYZ general partner- ship somehow qualifies as a moral person under the criteria stated earlier. If the concession theory provides a complete description of the corporation, XYZ will cease to be morally responsible for its actions the minute it incorporates. The Aggregate Theory The problem with the concession theory, then, is that it rejects most of what is important and relevant about corporations. The aggregate theory seems not to have this failing. It also seems to avoid the real entity theory's apparent wooly-headedness. Rather than positing intangible collectives, some with mysterious group personalities, the aggregate theory starts with the apparently solid fact of the discrete individual and builds from there. To this theory, a corporation is merely a collection of individuals- plus, per- haps, their relations, their positions, the firm's organizational structure, and its other features. Thus, a corporation's attributes are simply those of its constituents summed, and it has no attributes over and above their attributes.</page><page sequence="9">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 443 In principle, finally, corporate behavior can be explained from the interac- tions of the elements (mainly the people) that form it. Three interrelated aspects of the previous account, however, contain am- biguities, and those ambiguities highlight problems with the aggregate the- ory. First, to what extent are the relations that prevail within corporations external or internal? Second, which individuals are aggregated? In particu- lar, are they the corporation members as they once existed outside the orga- nization, or as they now exist inside it? Finally, are we aggregating the whole person, so to speak, or just the person in his or her "corporate" dimensions? Internal Relations and the Aggregate Theory. In this article, internal rela- tions are those that affect the nature of their terms, while external relations leave their terms unaffected. As Richard De George has argued, many social relations plainly are internal because they go some way toward constituting their human terms.54 Membership in a particular family or nation is an example. The same almost certainly is true, albeit to a lesser degree, for many relations people enter when they affiliate with organizations such as corporations.55 To a greater or lesser extent, that is, people are what they are because of their social relations, including the corporate relations in which they participate. To illustrate the difference between external and internal relations in a corporate setting, consider an argument sometimes used by foes of the ag- gregate theory: that decisions made by a small group such as a board of directors sometimes cannot be predicted from the traits group members brought to the decision making process. In some of these situations, the parties simply compromised on a position none held before the meeting because no decision would have been reached otherwise.56 Here, none of the participants really are changed by the decision making process. But now consider a different possibility. Whenever men act in common they invariably tend to develop a spirit which is different from themselves taken singly or in sum. No one who has had any experience as a member of a governing body, for example, can be ignorant of the fact that the decisions of such a body, even when they are unanimous, are often inexplicable if regarded from the point of view of the several characters of the individual members considered as so many units. . . . Under the inspiration of esprit de corps, the humane will give a ctuel decision, the ctuel a humane.S7 Here, the decision cannot be predicted from the original characters of the participants because those characters changed to some degree during the process. Although I do not think that some "group spirit" is necessary for this to occur, it seems obvious that a significant subset of the intracorporate relations in which corporation members engage are internal in the sense that they change those persons to some extent. Perhaps the most common exam- ples are the processes of socialization by which individuals come to internal- ize group goals, adopt group styles of behavior, and develop new abilities.</page><page sequence="10">444 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY These palpable facts of human existence create problems for the aggregate theory. Because people can have internal relations, the theory's basic units are not stable. Indeed, those units undergo change precisely as they enter the collectives whose features they are supposed to explain. Absent some method for determining how people will change as they interact, therefore, it is difficult to describe corporations from the traits its constituent individ- uals possess before they enter the firm. At this point, however, the second question posed earlier which people are to be aggregated-becomes rele- vant. To avoid the problem just posed, why not describe a corporation sim- ply by aggregating its members as they appear within the organization rather than as they exist outside it? Although some people have advocated exactly this approach,58 it strikes me as a desperate attempt to save a vulnerable theory. In saying this, I temporarily assume for purposes of argument that in principle any corporate action at a particular time can be explained from the corporation's human components and its other elements at that time. Given the malleability of those components, however, why bother? Before too long, these people probably will change as conditions within the organiza- tion change. Can such inconstant entities serve as genuine building blocks? In any event, my temporary assumption may be inaccurate too. As no less an anticollectivist than Keeley has conceded: [O]rganizations can have numerous properties that are not simply aggre- gates of (or reducible to) individual properties. For instance, an organiza- tion may produce consequences, like profits, that are true propetties of the organization; they come about because of the way people behave together, not just as aggregate effects of their separate behaviors.S9 Here, it is unclear whether Keeley's "individual properties" and "separate behaviors" are those people possess before affiliating with corporations, or those they possess at the time profits are made. Regardless, his example seems accurate in the latter case. If so, corporations have properties not contained in the people who generated those properties at the time they were generated. Who is Aggregated ? But even if Keeley is wrong or if I have misread him, the aggregate theory faces a final problem. All along, I have been arguing that aggregation underendows corporations because intracorporate interac- tion generates properties absent from corporation members as individuals. But it may overendow corporations too. Suppose everyone agrees that at some point in time all the XYZ Corporation's attributes can be found by aggregating its members as they exist at that time. Even so, if the elements aggregated are flesh-and-blood XYZ shareholders, directots, officers, and employees as they exist at some point, the aggregation inevitably will con- tain much superfluous data of a more or less personal nature. Jim is a Boy Scout leader; Mary is active in her church; Tom is an ACLU member; Lisa has a black belt in karate; Steve writes poetry; Cindy likes Bach; in March of 1991 Mike traded in his Mercury Cougar XR-7 and bought a Nissan Maxima SE. Except in the rarest cases, no one would regard the attributes and attitudes relevant to these activities as part of XYZ, because no one</page><page sequence="11">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 445 would regard them as "corporate." Any aggregation that includes them sim- ply drags in too much extraneous material. Thus, it seems that the units to be aggregated cannot be concrete human beings, but instead must comprise only those aspects including actions and conscious mental states of individual corporation members that are relevant to the corporation's affairs. (Because every business ethics article needs an acronym or two, I will call these segments persons-in-their-corpo- rate-aspect or PCAs.) But how are we to determine the slice of the individualss total being that constitutes his or her PCA? Perhaps this could be done by examining Jim, Mary, Tom, Lisa, Steve, Cindy, and Mike in minute detail and filtering out all the mental states (and associated actions, if any) that refer to "XYZ" or "the corporation." Possibly such an exercise presupposes a preexisting corporate entity, but I do not know. In any event, this "PCA question" is a problem for aggregationists. If they overcome the malleability of their basic units by aggregating flesh-and-blood people as they exist at a particular time within the firm, they give it too many attri- butes, but if they avoid this problem by constructing PCAs and aggregating them, they employ units that do not occur naturally and that cannot avoid some arbitrariness in their determination. The Nexus-of-Contracts Option. From what has transpired thus far, it seems that the aggregate theory's main problems concern its most important building blocks the individual human beings who constitute corporations. First, I argued that because these people are internally related to each other within the corporation, they are too changeable to serve as bricks for the corporate mansion. Then I argued that even if this difficulty can be sur- mounted by aggregating people as they exist within the firm, the aggregate theory encounters further problems because the elements aggregated cannot be flesh-and-blood human beings in their totality. Again, therefore, the theoryss basic units lack the needed solidity. For these reasons, I concluded, the aggregate theory has great difficulty describing corporations and ex- plaining their behavior. This, in turn, undermines the theory's claim to dispense with the need for a distinct corporate entity, thus raising the possi- bility that corporations may be moral persons after all. One way of combatting these problems, salvaging the aggregate theory, and denying corporate moral personhood might be to create abstract basic units with great stability and to explain the corporation's nature and doings with reference to these. This basically is the approach taken by the economists' new nexus-of-contracts theory, whose "actors are rational, eco- nomic actors driven by their divergent self-interests, and seeking to maxi- mize values for themselves."60 "To find the firm's essence, the theory looks solely to the behavior of [such] individual actors.''6l Because those actors obviously are not concrete human beings, some readers might reject the nexus- of-contracts theory outright. But as Judge Richard Posner has observed: [I]t is true that the assumptions of economic theory are one-dimensional and pallid when viewed as descriptions of human behavior.... However, ab- straction reductionism, if you like-is of the essence of scientific inquiry.</page><page sequence="12">446 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY A scientific theory must select from the welter of experience that it is trying to explain, and it is therefore necessarily unrealistic when compared di- rectly to actual conditions. Newton's law of falling bodies, for example, is unrealistic in its basic assumption that bodies fall in a vacuum, but it is still a useful theory because it predicts with reasonable accuracy the behavior of a wide variety of falling bodies in the real wotld. Similarly, an economic theory of law will not capture the full complexity, richness, and confusion of the phenomena . . . that it seeks to illuminate. But its lack of realism, far from invalidating the theory, is the essential precondition of theory. A the- ory that sought faithfully to reproduce the complexity of the empitical world in its assumptions would not be a thec)ry an explanation but a description.62 The nexus-of-contracts approach, then, might salvage the aggregate theory if it achieves enough predictive successes. Although I am not equipped to pursue the point, I wonder whether the nexus-of-contracts theory should command our allegiance even if it success- fully predicts everything about corporations and their members. Were this the case, two realms would present themselves for our consideration: (1) the realm of concrete everyday experience (in which the aggregate theory has problems), and (2) the hidden realm of economic man (which explains ev- erything in the first realm on aggregationist premises). Which realm pro- vides the true account of corporations, their members, and relations between the two? Which is most appropriate for determining whether corporations are moral persons? As I said, answering such questions is beyond my com- petence, but the same generally is true of economists. In any event, one can legitimately wonder how many genuine predictive successes the nexus-of-contracts approach will ever achieve. In a recent book, for example, even Posner has voiced reservations about the explana- tory power of economic theory.63 Perhaps most importantly, he now ques- tions whether economic explanations are falsifiable in any significant way. In part, this is because "economic theory has become so rich, so complex, that almost any hypothesis . . . could be made to conform to theory.'64 Another reason is the infeasibility of controlled experiments in most areas r Or economlc lnqulry. More importantly, at least some of the corporate phenomena of present concern certain changes people undergo after they affiliate with groups- cannot be explained on the basis of economic theory because they directly conflict with its assumption of self-interested rationality. The changes to which I refer involve the individual's subordination to collective purposes and her consequent assumption of duties that are subjectively perceived as morally binding.65 Such altruism really exists, even today. Perhaps it is most noticeable in organizations such as the military, police departments, and fire departments, but I think that it is present to some degree in virtually all organized groups. How is the nexus-of-contracts theory to explain these decidedly unself-interested attitudes and behaviors? One option is to argue that despite superficial appearances, they really are self-interested when</page><page sequence="13">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 447 properly examined. But the failures of psychological egoism66 make this approach implausible. Another option is to argue that people are socialized to self-subordination so that the collective self-interest might be advanced. For instance, we all benefit from the organizational ethos that motivates police officers and firefighters to risk their lives in the furtherance of their duties, and corporate performance generally is enhanced if enough employ- ees can be conditioned to put the firm's interests ahead of their own. But how can self-abnegating attitudes and behavior follow from the assumption of universal rational self-interestedness underlying economic theory? The assumption explains everyone's interest in generating such attitudes and behavior in others, but not any particular person's adoption of those atti- tudes. To be sure, a rationally self-interested individual might act altruisti- cally; our aspiring public servants, for example, may join the military or the Peace Corps with their political futures in mind. But why should such a person ever acquire altruistic values? How could she ever be conditioned to accept such values without abandoning the postulates on which the nexus- of-contracts theory rests? The Last Line of Defense. The "intrinsic liberalism" of the nexus-of-con- tracts approach, William Bratton observes, makes it S'attractive to the con- temporary legal academic audience, the members of which tend to share the liberal ideal."67 The liberalism to which Bratton refers is not the liberalism of ordinary political discourse, but "a liberal vision in which individual choice shapes social life."68 Where, as seems to be true of the contemporary United States, such a vision is widespread, it could weaken the individual's identification with the corporation and hence its tendency to transform him. If so, the internal relations and the tendency toward altruism described above might still be present, but could be so weak as not to matter practi- cally. As A.C. Ewing once observed: [W]hatever the relation between diffetent things, it must vary greatly in degree of eloseness. If all the relations of a thing are relevant to it, they eertainly eannot all be equally relevant. We certainly eould not get on at all in practieal life or in seienee if in making foreeasts and in deseribing the nature of a thing we eould not ignore most of them.... Whatever may be the ultimate truth philosophically, praetically we must be pluralists.69 Ewing was talking about the idealist belief that all relations are internal and that the universe therefore forms an interconnected whole, but his remarks also have some application here. If the internal relations in which people participate are fairly weak, corporations might usefully be regarded as ag- gregates, even though in some ultimate sense they are not. Today there is some evidence that, unlike the organization men of the l950s, modern managers keep a certain critical distance from the corpora- tions for which they work. When discussing the ethic of team play that pervades American corporations, for example, Robert Jackall's Moral Mazes observes that: Some observers have intetpreted such conformity, team playing, continual</page><page sequence="14">448 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY affability, and emphasis on social finesse as evidence of the decline of the individualism of the old Protestant ethic.... [But] these writers miss the main point. Managets up and down the corporate ladder adopt their public faces quite consciously; they are, in fact, the masks behind which the real struggles and moral issues of the corporation can be found.70 Rather than internalizing some communitarian value system, in other words, Jackallss managers adopt its externals to advance egoistic ends. Taken as a whole, his book provides much ammunition for those who would argue that, whatever the real truth of the matter, today's corporations are de facto aggregates. Because corporations and other groupings naturally will vary in the extent to which they socialize their members, this argument may counsel case-by- case determinations of a corporation's "aggregate" status. Por example, Jackall's corporations, firms with a few dominant individuals, and many closed corporations might be classified as aggregates, while those with a strong collective ethos and those still populated with stereotypical organi- zation men might be treated as real entities. Some of this messiness, how- ever, might be avoided by a version of the real entity theory that does not require tight internal relations. The Real Entity Theory All things considered, I suspect that the aggregate theory would fare better if its proponents rejected any attempt to explain corporations and simply refused to take them seriously. In other words, the theory might be more persuasive if it simply affirmed that the individual is primary, talked about collectivities as little as possible, and treated them as mere metaphors when forced to consider them. Due to the instability of the aggregate theory's human building blocks, however, even this approach might not succeed. More importantly, it begs a key question: whether corporations actually are real entities in themselves. What, then, can be said for the real entity theory? Standard Arguments for the Real Entity Theory. Some arguments for the real existence of corporate entities are little more than appeals to self-evi- dence supported by stirring rhetoric. In Harold Laski's 1916 Harvard Law Review article entitled "The Personality of Associations," for instance, vir- tually the only argument for that personality was the following statement: Clearly, there is compulsion in our personalising. We do it because we must. We do it because we feel in these things the red blood of a living personality. Here are no mere abstractions of an over-exuberant imagination. The need is so apparent as to make plain the reality beneath.7l Sometimes the corporate entity's existence apparently was so self-evident as not to require even rhetorical support. In a 1905 article, W. Jethro Brown considered whether corporations are distinct from the persons who consti- tute them, and pronounced this assertion '*too obvious to need proof" be- cause "[t]he whole is more than its parts."72 However, Brown did not try to refute the aggregationist assertion that the whole is the sum of its parts and nothing more.</page><page sequence="15">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 449 Other arguments for the real entity theory depend on the way we treat collec- tives in thought and language. In his 1911 Harvard Law Review piece, Machen's main reason for concluding that collectives are real entities and not aggregates was that people so regard them in ordinary thinking and discourse. For example: "Was there ever a schoolboy who had any difficulty in understanding that his school is something distinct from the boys that constitute it?"73 Another example is the common tendency to describe cor- porations as beings that can act (e.g., S'Exxon ships, refines, and sells petroleum products"). Still another is our tendency to regard a group as the same entity even as its membership changes over time.74 In my ordinary unreflective thought and conversation, at least, today's Exxon is the same as the Exxon of last week, even though its human composition surely has changed during the interim. A final relevant tendency is our willingness to describe groups in terms that we do not apply to their constituent individuals, taken individu- ally. To use Anthony Quinton's example, "[t]he German people is numerous but no individual German can be significantly said to be so."75 As arguments for the existence of distinct corporate entities, however, the more or less lin- guistic points just described seem persuasive at best. To me, at least, they would pack more weight were they accompanied by a theory demonstrating some connection between our everyday thought and language and the reality it purports to describe. Otherwise, these arguments appear open to the familiar charge that the collective "real entities" of our thought and language are only metaphors. BetterArgumentsfor the Real Entity Theory? Although neither is without its problems, two different (and overlapping) arguments for the real entity theory strike me as superior to those just made. The first builds on my previous observation that some intracorporate relations are internal because they help constitute their human terms. Idealist philosophers were prone to believe that if two terms are internally related, they form an entity contain- ing those terms.76 Thus, if this belief is true, a collection of people who are internally related to each other form an entity that contains each of them. For example, as no less a foe of idealist political philosophy than L.T. Hobhouse once conceded: "Family life . . . necessarily exercises a profound influence upon its members. The family is a whole which co-operates for certain purposes and in which the various members lead lives quite other than that they would do if the family were scattered."77 Corporations, of course, also are "wholes" in this sense. As Hobhouse continued: In an organized body, a profession, for example, a Trade Union, a business, a factory, there is again a whole numbering so many scores, hundreds, thousands of individuals as its members. In every case the members are in greater or lesser degree modified by the association into which they enter. Of the Trade Union, of the profession or business, certain things will hold true, which would not hold true of the individuals who belong to any of those associations if they did not belong to them.... A college may have for hundreds of years a certain peculiar character and stamp of its own. The number of individuals passing through it and affected by it is quite indefi- nite. It is not constituted solely by the number present within its walls at</page><page sequence="16">450 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY any given time; not can we enumerate those who may have come within its influence during the whole period of its establishment.78 Technically, I suppose, Hobhouse's "individuals" really are PCAs; hope- fully, however, his sketch makes my point. But is it true that internally related terms form an entity distinct from, if nonetheless embracing, those terms? Alternatively, are Hobhouse's "wholes" real entities? My only justification for this general proposition is a negative one that essentially is a rerun of my basic argument against the aggregate theory. Suppose that all the XYZ Corporationss human constitu- ents are what they are only because they are members of XYZ. If, as I argued earlier, it makes little sense to say that XYZ is the sum of such variable elements, what description is left? The only evident possibility is to regard the collection of internally related constituents as itself an entity of some kind. My second argument for the existence of real corporate entities arises from any serious attempt to describe them as aggregates. The argument presupposes a view that I will neither attempt to justify nor dignify with a name: that at least some of our thinking tries to make the flux of experience easier to handle by lumping together related qualities or objects and giving the collection a general name, and that wholes thus established have some claim to reality as distinct entities. As the previous discussion has sug- gested, to really characterize a corporation as an aggregate, one has to list and describe all the phenomena it contains. Such an effort would at least have to include the corporation's human personnel, its organizational struc- ture, its decision making processes, the products or services it generates, and the internal and external relations that exist among all of these. Because the internally related parts of this collection would have different qualities outside the collection, we must be careful to describe them as they exist within it And we also must be careful to exclude from the description all noncorporate actions and mental states i.e, to describe the human parts as PCAs. Assuming it to be possible, such a description could resemble a snapshot or drawing of all the corporation's many elements at a particular point in time, one capable of revealing features (such as relations) that are not themselves perceptible to our senses. Due to the corporation's formal and informal organization, these elements almost certainly would be ar- ranged in some more or less definite pattern. But what is this "aggregate" I am depicting? To me, it is more plausibly characterized as a system79 in which all the elements are included and organ- ized. Specifically, a corporation is an assemblage of people and other things unified into a consistent whole by their regular interrelationship.80 As pic- tured above, it looks like a system; indeed, it resembles a fleshed-out organ- izational chart. Also, the two problems that plagued the aggregate theory-the malleability of the corporation's human units and the need to reduce them to PCAs-seem less troublesome if corporations are regarded as systems. If you attribute independent reality to the system as a whole, its elements' variable and fragmented nature is less bothersome than if you</page><page sequence="17">CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD 451 must build the system from such elements. Indeed, if the whole is real, one might even expect its elements to appear unstable and incomplete. More- over, because this system, while hardly an eternal Form, is a more or less integrated, self-contained, and distinguishable unit with a degree of stability over time, it also can be regarded as a distinct entity.81 For all the reasons discussed earlier, this entity has attributes that differ from the sum of its elements' attributes as they existed outside the collectivity. However, it is not clear that this makes the whole either greater than the sum of its parts or morally superior to its parts. Later in this article, for example, I find myself unable to identify any corporate will separate from the wills of its members. Possible Objections. As I noted earlier, part of the aggregate theory's initial appeal to some people is its apparently common-sense, hard-headed, even scientific, approach to the subject of describing corporatior.s. Real entity theories, on the other hand, tend to postulate intangible, unperceiv- able collective attributes that naturally provoke suspicion. My previous discussion of the aggregate theory, I hope, went some way toward dispelling the first impression, but uneasiness about the real entity theory probably remains. For instance, my version of the theory has features that cannot be directly observed e.g., the various interpersonal relations that exist within corporations. But the same charge could be levelled against many of the fundamental particles postulated by physics.82 I suppose someone could argue that at least the fundamental particles are material entities, but if immaterial things are unreal, I imagine that human consciousness, scientific theories, and mathematical proofs would have to bite the dust. Another common objection to characterizing groups as real entities con- cerns the anti-individualistic implications of the characterization. My ear- lier quotation from Maitland, with its depiction of corporations as living organisms and group-persons with a group-will, suggests why. If people are nothing more than cells in such an organism, their actions must and prob- ably should-reflect the overarching imperatives of the group. Thus, we see charges that the real entity theory is hostile to human freedom and that its proponents are witting or unwitting agents of totalitarianism.83 Fully addressing such charges probably would require another article. Still, a few remarks on the subject seem useful. First, it is not obvious that the real entity theory's authoritarian or totalitarian implications bear on its truth or falsity. As De George has suggested, if such a theory is true, it is true, and its unpalatable consequences do not invalidate it.84 Except to the most extreme methodological individualists or libertarians, however, the consequences may not be so unpalatable. The reason is that not all versions of the real entity theory imply that groups swallow up the individuals form- ing them. After noting the "exaggerated individualism" of those who would deny independent reality to groups, for example, Hobhouse criticizes those who "regard society as an entity distinct from the individuals, not merely in the sense that it is an aggregate of individuals viewed in some special relation, but in the sense that it is a whole which in some way stands outside them, or in which they are merged to the prejudice of their individual iden-</page><page sequence="18">452 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY tity."85 This notwithstanding, Hobhouse obviously regarded groups as real entities. In addition to the remarks quoted earlier, for instance, he main- tained that "[e]very association of men is legitimately regarded as an entity possessing certain characteristics of its own, characteristics which do not belong to the individuals apart from their membership of [sic] that associa- tion."86 Actually, those who criticize the anti-individualism of the real entity the- ory or of the claim that corporations are moral persons seem more concerned with the uses to which such ideas might be pllt than with their truth or falsity. Specifically, the apparent fear is that such ideas can help legitimize im- proper exercises of control by dominant group members, those who claim special insight into the corporate organism's True Goals, or other assorted gurus and Knowers.87 But while this fear may be well-based, it hardly seems sufficient to suppress inquiry into the nature of corporations. Although I am inclined to doubt it, for example, conceivably they really are full-fledged moral organisms to whose Higher Purposes their members should submit. In any event, the version of the real entity theory propounded here is relatively resistant to the objections stated in the preceding two paragraphs. Although I have depicted individuals as something less than autonomous, self-determining basic units in terms of which groups can be explained, those groups are not especially solid either. Individuals form them, individ- uals leave them, and individuals terminate them. As I suggested earlier, moreover, by now some people's employment-based internal relations may be so weak that their corporate employers, while perhaps real entities in some ultimate sense, are better classed as aggregates for practical purposes. Although this should not prevent most corporations from qualifying as real entities, it hardly suggests that they are full-blooded moral organisms. Only infrequently, moreover, do such employertcorporations fully preempt their employees' lives. One reason is that most people are members of more than one group. Another is that, strictly speaking, only their members' PCAs are elements of corporations. Although if human personality is a unit, one's corporate affiliations presumably influence the noncorporate aspects of one's life, those affiliations hardly seem completely determinative. The whole PCA notion, however, probably strikes some readers as weird. Sometimes it strikes me the same way. But on balance it seems less objec- tionable than the alternatives. First, methodological individualists who ob- ject to my slicing apart the lives of flesh-and-blood human beings to form PCAs should recall that I originally did so to save the aggregate theory from overendowing corporations. My point was that whatever difficulties such surgery creates, they are fewer than those posed by viewing organizations as composed of people in their totality. For the reasons stated earlier, more- over, the PCA notion appears less troublesome for the real entity theory than for the aggregate theory. Fragmented constituents like PCAs probably pose fewer difficulties if we attribute independent reality to groups than if we regard them as aggregates of such elements. The PCA notion also may be helpful in describing situations where people</page><page sequence="19">453 CORPORATE MORAL PERSONHOOD have multiple group memberships. Suppose that Jim Goodfellow is an offi- cer of the ABC Corporation, a big family man, a devoted member of his church, and an officer of his town's city council. Regardless of whether these groups are aggregates or real entities, they are misdescribed if they contain Jim in his entirety and better characterized if they include only those aspects of Jim that pertain to the group's affairs. Of course, the same Jim whose various features are thus parcelled out to various groups also exists in his own right as a complete human being. Thus, my conception may result in some double-counting of Jim's various actions and mental states. But this would be true to an even greater extent in standard accounts of multiple group membership that somehow envision the same complete person's pres- ence in several groups. Are These Real Entities Morally Responsible? Assuming for the sake of argument that corporations are real entities of the general sort described, do they have the necessary attributes for moral personhood? First, it seems evident that such a whole or collective can act through its human members. Because those members are part of the corporate entity, their actions are actions of the corporation as well.88 "To talk about what England did or does is to talk about what Englishmen did or do, but not just to speak of the doings of a number of separate persons."89 Similarly, to talk about the XYZ Corporation's actions is to talk about the actions of its various members. But does this mean that XYZ is responsible for all the actions its human mem- bers perform? For example, does XYZ act when its vice-president runs over a small child after a hard bout of drinking at a vacation resort? Because XYZ's members are PCAs and because those human fragments only contain corporate-related actions, XYZ is not responsible for such acts. For much the same reasons, corporations-as-systems also can act inten- tionally, recklessly, and negligently. The mental states associated with such actions are those of its human constituents. Because those constituents are PCAs, and because PCAs were defined as including the mental states ac- companying a person's corporate-related acts, a corporation only is responsi- ble for its members' intentional, reckless, or negligent corporate-related acts. But what about the acts that make a theory of specifically corporate moral responsibility necessary: those for which no natural person (or PCA) is responsible? No such actor, I will assume, can be said either to have caused the harmful action, or to have intended it or have been reckless or-negligent regarding it. Here, I suppose that Maitland's group will could provide a basis for corporate moral responsibility. But I cannot see any basis for such a collective mind from the description of corporations I have advanced. The Collective Will, in other words, may really be a metaphor. If so, the only apparent remaining possibility is to attempt to sum the actions and mental states of the corporation's PCAs, argue that added together they caused the relevant event and formed the necessary mental state, and assert that the corporate system should be responsible for everything that happens within it. Still, I am unsure whether such an argument is plausible without a group mind to order the action and observe all the summed mental states.</page><page sequence="20">454 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY Conclusion In this article I have argued, with varying degrees of confidence, for three main contentions: (1) that the concession theory of the corporation has little descriptive value and that any conclusions about corporate moral person- hood based on that theory should be rejected; (2) that the aggregate theory's many difficulties render it a barely plausible account of corporations, and also undermine its claim to dispense with the need for a distinct corporate entity; and (3) that corporations probably, although not certainly, should be described as systems which are real entities in themselves, and that such a conception of the corporation renders corporations morally responsible for many, but not all, of their acts. All things considered, I suspect, my attacks on the aggregate theory are stronger than my arguments for the real entity theory. Even if those latter arguments are persuasive, though, they seem to break down where they are most needed because they fail to justify specif- ically corporate moral responsibility in those cases where no corporation member is herself responsible. But perhaps the difficulty lies with the tests of moral responsibility adopted at the beginning of this article rather than its conclusions about corporations. If so, Held may be right when she sug- gests that instead of using person-centered notions of moral responsibility, ethicists should develop criteria tailored to corporations. Anyone attempting to develop such criteria, however, hardly can avoid considering what corpo- rations are.

James G. March &amp; Herbert A. Simon, Organizations 4 (1958), quoted for purposes of discussion in Keeley, supra note 5, at 21-22 (emphasis in original). 82See Quinton, supra note 75, at 4, 5. 83"My view is that philosophers who subscribe to the theory that the corporation is a moral agerlt that is morally responsible for its wrongful acts are unwittingly allying themselves with . . . [a] new fonn of totalitarianism [based on the goal of organizational 'Shealth''].' Velasquez, sllpra note 6, at 16. See also D.E. Lewis, Collective Responsibility, 23 Philosophy 3, 16-17 (1948) (linking notion of collective responsibility to idealist theories of the state and to a related idea of community well-being "whose natural terminus is the ruthless oppression and totalitarianism against which our face is so resolutely set in democratic countries"). 84De George, sapra note 54, at lO. In this connection, Keeley recently has called for a more overtly value-centered approach to organization theory, one that stresses individual rights and attacks the anti-individualistic models that dominate the area. See, e.g., Keeleys supra note 5, at chapter 1; Stewart Herman, Furthering the Conversation Between Philoso- phy and Organization Theory, 1 Bus. Ethics Q. 121, 123-24 (1991) (reviewing Keeley's book). However, while Keeley emphasizes how normative conclusions shape descriptive paradigms, I do not read him as arguing that one can proceed directly from particular ethical conclusions to a specific conception of what organizations are. 85Hobhouse, supra note 77, at 29. 861d. at 27. 875ee, e.g., Keeley, sllpra note 5, at 51-52; cf.
