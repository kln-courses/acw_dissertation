<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Pottery in Northern Africa - An Overview Friederike Jesse Abstract The emergence of pottery is a compelling issue for archaeologists. In Africa , pottery appeared in what is now the southern part of the Sahara and the Sahel at different localities and in different contexts in the 10th millennium bp. This paper aims to give an overview of the available data concerning early pottery in Northern Africa. The radiocarbon evidence is considered as well as technological features of the pottery ; the decoration and the site context. The areas of the earliest appearance of pottery in Northern Africa were uninhabited during the hyperarid phase at the end of the Pleistocene. Intriguing questions are therefore the origin of the Early Holocene occupants and of their knowledge of potting and of course the role of early pottery in the prehistoric groups. Résumé L'émergence de la céramique reste un sujet des plus fascinant pour les archéologues. En Afrique, la céramique apparaît au cours du 10e millénaire bp dans une vaste région qui correspond maintenant à la lisière sud du Sahara et au Sahel, dans des endroits divers et des contextes différents. Cette contribution vise à dresser un bilan de nos connaissances sur les plus anciennes céramiques de la partie septentrionale de l'Afrique. Les datations y sont abordées, autant que les aspects technologiques, les décors et le contexte des sites de découverte. Les régions considérées ici n'étant pas occupées pendant la phase de l 'aridité extrême de la fin du Pléistocéne, l'origine des premiers habitants et du « savoir céramique », ainsi que le rôle de ces premières céramiques pour les populations préhistoriques, constituent des questions importantes.

Jesse Regarding early pottery in Africa, the situation has not much changed since the overview given by Angela Close (1995): the status of early ceramics still is "few and far between". Some intriguing new finds such as the early evidence for pottery in Ounjougou in Mali (Huysecom et al. 2004a, 2004b, 2009) added, however, to the picture and make it highly interesting to take a closer look again on early pottery in Africa. The age of early pottery is of course important (cf. Jesse 2003a) but the evidence shall also be considered against the background of the environmental and socioeconomic setting. The area under investigation is the northern part of Africa (Fig. 1) and the period of the 10th and 9th millennia bp. Afterwards, from the 8th millennium bp onwards, pottery is a common phenomenon in this part of the continent. The sites relevant for a discussion of the appearance of pottery in northern Africa have been excavated and studied during the last seven decades under various and sometimes very difficult conditions. Methods of research and analysis have developed and improved over time. However, the amount and quality of the available information on the sites is very inho- mogenous, which makes the use and the interpretation of some data complicated. Especially the quality of the radiocarbon dates and their connection with the archaeological material is sometimes difficult to esti- mate. Additionally, important sites still lack detailed publication. Early pottery - some introductory remarks The emergence of pottery is one of the most compel- ling issues in archaeology given the complexity of the subject and the consequences of its introduction and use. Pottery was developed independently by dif- ferent societies in different economic and ecological surroundings (cf. Barnett &amp; Hoopes eds. 1995). The manufacture of pottery involves a bunch of knowledge and "each stage of mixing, shaping, drying and firing has its pitfalls to the uninitiated that can easily spoil the work" (Brown 1989: 203). The knowledge of earthy material, the mastering of manufacturing techniques and especially of fire allow for the complete transfor- mation of the basic material: "Pot-making is perhaps the earliest conscious utilization by man [sic] of a chemical change. (...) To early man [sic] this change in the quality of the material must have seemed a sort of magic transubstantiation - the conversion of mud or dust into stone. It may have prompted some philo- sophical questions as to the meaning of substance and sameness." (Childe 1937: 101-102). The oldest known evidence for fired ceramics are figurines. The Upper Palaeolithic site of Dolni Vestonice (Czech Republic), a seasonal campsite for mammoth hunters dated to about 26,000 bp, yielded thousands of fragments of fired ceramics. Zoo- and anthropomorphic figures, among them the famous "Venus of Dolni Vestonice", had been formed of local wetted loess. The intent of the makers was, however, not to create permanent features as the earthen objects were fired when still wet. The resultant and obviously volitional destruction by the thermal shock was per- haps related to some sort of ritual (Vandiver et al. 1989; Rice 1999: 4). Manipulation of clay in Palaeo- lithic times is also attested at other sites (cf. Vandiver et al. 1989: 1002). At the cave sites of Afalou Bou Rhummel and Tamar Hat in the Bejaia Bay (Algeria) pieces of ceramic were found in the Iberomaurusian levels. While at Tamar Hat just one piece is present (Saxon et al. 1974: 49) the evidence at Afalou Bou Rhummel numbers 55 pieces (Hachi et al. 2002: 68). In Tamar Hat, a horn-shaped fragment with a grit- tempered matrix was discovered in Layer 60 in a soil lens between two ash deposits in a re-used hearth. Probably a barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia ) was represented. A sample taken from the centre of the fragment gave a thermoluminescence date of older than 10,000 bp. Radiocarbon dates on wood charcoal are available for Layer 84/85 (MC-822: 20,600 ± 500 bp) and Layer 50 (MC-820: 19,800 ± 500 bp), thus an age of about 20,000 bp for this ceramic piece is sup- posed (Saxon et al. 1974: 50, 67; Saxon 1976: 327). The altogether 55 pieces of cooked clay attested at Afalou Bou Rhummel represent anthropomorph and zoomorph figurines and burnt pieces of clay. They were found in levels dated by radiocarbon evidence between 11,500 and 15,000 bp (Hachi et al. 2002: 67 and 66, fig. 4). Archaeometric analysis indicates temperatures of firing between 500° and 900° C for most of the objects. The clay used for the manufacture of the pieces was procured close to the site (Hachi et al. 2002: 91-93). The site is a necropolis and was frequented over a long period indicating the special meaning of the location. The clay objects seem to represent a special activity with a complex symbolic preoccupation (Hachi 2006: 437-438). But the manipulation of clay in Palaeolithic times did not lead to vessel production. The need for an utili- tarian use of ceramics arose later, at the transition of the Pleistocene to the Holocene (Hoopes &amp; Barnett 1995:2; Rice 1999). The earliest evidence for pottery vessels is from Asia. In Japan, Jomon pottery dates back to around 220 Journal of African Archaeology Vol . 8 (2), 2010</page><page sequence="3">Early Pottery in Northern Africa Fig. 1.

More or less simultaneously pottery ap- peared in southern China ( ca 13,700 - 13,300 bp) and the Russian Far East (ca 13,300 bp) (Kuzmin 2006: 368-369; Rice 1999: 14-15). In Africa pottery was invented in the 10th millennium bp (Close 1995; Jesse 2003a). The invention "took place within the zone that is now the southern Sahara and the Sahel", and pot- tery was certainly developed more than once, under various conditions and in different areas (Close 1995: 23, here also the quotation). In western Asia, pottery appeared around 8000 bp and then spread rapidly to Europe. In the New World, the oldest evidence comes from sites in the Amazonian region going back to the 8th millennium bp (Rice 1999: 16-21). Dealing with early pottery is not only a question of its old age. As Prudence Rice put it: "Most funda- mentally, we may ask, Why pots?" (Rice 1999: 2). The site of Dolni Věstonice with two kilns and a multitude of ceramic fragments indicates a solid knowledge of the properties of fired clay but given the gap of several millennia before the next appearance of objects made of fired clay this seems to have been a technological dead end (Lambert 2005: 4). The concept of fired clay was that of prestige, the practical aspect was not con- sidered necessary. The notion of the utility of products of fired clay - as containers for holding solids and liquids for storing and cooking - shortly, the notion of ceramic pots as tools changed the situation. There is a broad range of ideas about the origins of pottery (for an overview cf. Rice 1999) but the main point seems to be that pottery finally was invented to fulfill specific purposes. These can be manifold and range from prac- tical purposes such as storage, transport or cooking to more sophisticated ones such as display of group identity, wealth and social status. Certain ecological and socioeconomic factors are important for the emergence of early pottery: Sédentarisation and the beginning of food-production or at least an intensified exploitation of resources are closely linked with pottery though no indispensable prerequisits (cf. Rice 1999: 25, 28). Pottery broadens the spectrum of utilisable plants as it allows for boiling small food such as grains or seeds, and may be useful in detoxifying food or just make Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010 221</page><page sequence="4">F. Jesse it more digestible1. Ceramic vessels can be left unat- tended on the fire and they allow for a broader range of food preparation techniques. The fact that ceramic vessels add a desirable taste to food and liquids should not be forgotten (Arnold 1985: 128-144, tab. 6.1 for an overview on toxic constituents in plant foodstuffs that can be reduced or destroyed by processes involving pot- tery; for the taste of food prepared in ceramic containers also Barley 1994: 76). Pottery plays an important role in feasting and the work with earth is strongly associated with mythology: "Pots, then, slide over into views about the world and each pot is intimately connected with the social and cultural milieu that creates it" (Barley 1994: 72). Potting has its special place in religious thought: the creation of something new by transforming earthy mate- rial through fire {cf. Barley 1994: 47). Ceramic vessels are closely linked with the human body, this is reflected in descriptive terms such as body, neck, shoulder and lip used in ceramic analysis (Haaland 2009: 228). The idea of a metamophorical link between pots and the hu- man body also becomes apparent regarding decoration as similar patterns can be found on the human body and vessels {cf. Barley 1994: 136). Pottery incorporates both, practical and prestige items. The intriguing ques- tion is their discernability in the archaeological record. Early pottery in Northern Africa - the evidence The radiocarbon dates The oldest radiocarbon dates which can be linked to utilitarian pottery in Northern Africa point to the 10th millennium bp {Tab. 1). Mapping the respective sites at least two main centres for the first use of pottery appear: one is located in the central and one in the eastern part of the Sahara (Fig. 1). For the Central Sahara the sites of Tagalagal and Adrar Bous 10 clearly testify to the existence of pottery from about 9400 bp onwards. The age of the pottery at both sites has been confirmed by thermoluminescence dates from four sherds, resulting in an age of between 10,180 ± 780 and 9820 ±780 before 1 993 at Tagalagal and between 10,500 ± 750 and 9530 ± 730 before 1993 at Adrar Bous (Roset 1996: 177, 2000: 268). At Temet {Fig. i), from where the oldest radiocarbon date (9550 ±100 bp, Paris) generally linked to the emergence of pottery in Africa is known, no pottery was found during the excavation; how- ever, a toothed object made of fibrolite found in situ was interpreted as a potter's comb and therefore linked with the knowledge of ceramic technology (Roset 1 987 : 222f. Also a date in the 10th millennium bp at Tamaya Mellet is prob- lematic regarding its connection with pottery: At Tamaya Mellet {Fig. 7), several zones of occupation have been identified. A faunai sample collected on site TMY 3 gave a radiocarbon date of 9350 ± 170 bp (Gif- 1728) (Paris et al. 1993: 380, 385) but the place has been favourable for human settlement throughout time as is indicated by buri- als dated to around 5000 bp (Paris et al. 1993: 385, 1999: 133). Pottery of an early type is present and two sherds with a very characteristic plant temper were dated to the 8th millennium bp (7550H50 bp, Pa-1571, and 7415±150 bp, Pa- 1574; Paris et al. 1999: 133). An earlier pottery collection from the site was studied by Anthony Arkell who recognised a similarity between parts of the pottery of Tamaya Mellet and Early Khartoum pottery (Arkell 1 949: 117). This fits well with the date of the 8th millennium bp for the sherds, but does not exclude the possibility of the existence of pottery already in the 10th millennium bp as seen by the radiocarbon dates for Early Khartoum type pottery in the Nile Valley {cf. Jesse 2003b: tab. 60). In the eastern part of the Sahara ceramics were also in use in the 10th millennium bp. The oldest and most numerous evidence comes from site E-79-8 in the Bir Kiseiba region (Connor 1984: 239-240; Close 1995). The site of Sorourab 2 has given two charcoal dates of about 9300 bp. These dates, however, have not been universally accepted (Marks &amp; Mohammed-Ali eds. 1991: 239) as the site was previously dated to the 7th and 6th millennia bp (Mohammed-Ali 1982: 173). At Wadi el Akhdar 83/33 in the Gilf Kebir undecorated, organic tempered pottery (Schön 1996: pl. 107.7) has given a radiocarbon age of 9 1 00 bp. The direct dating of a second, decorated sherd {ibid.: pl. 107.9) of the same ware provided an age in the 7th millennium bp (Gehlen et al. 2002: 111, tab. 1). One problem encountered when directly dating potsherds is that the clay could contain old organic remains falsifying the result {cf. Paris et al. 1999: 52). The question of the age of the pottery in the Gilf Kebir therefore still remains open. Recent investigations in the area of Ounjougou {Fig. 1 ) turned out to be of high interest for the question 1 The enormous nutritional potential provided by cereal proteins and vitamins is only accessible for the human body when transforming cereals such as wheat or barley by brewing, cooking or baking (Katz &amp; Voigt 1986: 30-31). Legumes assume an important role as source of protein but contain toxic factors such as trypsin inhibi- tors, which can be eliminated by the proper application of heat. This effect also enhances the nutritive value of the proteins of the legumes (Liener 1962: tab. 1). Therefore, the "evolution of cuisine made certain plants accessible to humans but only to humans" as humans are able to overcome plant defenses in the proverbial 'cooking poť (Katz &amp; Voigt 1986: 25, here also the quotation). 2 For a critical view on the evidence at Temet see Huysecom et al. (2009: 913). 222 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010</page><page sequence="5">Early Pottery in Northern Africa of early ceramics in Northern Africa as it is the west- ern- and southernmost evidence for early pottery so far known. At the site of Ravin de la Mouche two small fragments of pottery have been found in unit H A3 -A and dated by radiocarbon evidence between 9610 and 9515 bp (Huysecom et al. 2009: 907, fig. 1). Three sherds, found in the deepest deposit HAI, are prob- ably even older than 9700 bp; no radiocarbon dates are available for the HAI formation but two dates from the archaeologically sterile HA2 formation above, 9785 ± 70 bp and 95 10 ± 70 bp, provide a terminus ante quern (Huysecom et al. 2009: 907, fig. 1 and 909-910). In the 9th millennium bp the number of sites with pottery increases {Tab. 1). The sites still cluster in the central and the eastern part of the Sahara (Fig. 1). Again, Tamaya Mellet poses some problems: a radiocarbon age of 8320 ± 300 bp (Pa-236, Paris et al. 1993: 385) was determined on a charcoal sample from a hearth at the site Tamaya Mellet 1 (TMY 1). Pottery is present but scarce and the decorative patterns are of a later Neolithic appearance. Use of the site in the 4th millennium bp is attested by further radiocarbon dates. The site was occupied in the 9th millennium bp as is indicated by the charcoal date and a lithic industry with numerous Ounan-points. Stone vessels were also attributed to this early Holocene occupation (Parish al. 1999: 129-130). From the available published information it is, however, not possible to definitely link pottery to the radiocarbon date of the 9th millennium bp. At Ounjougou, pottery was found at the site of Ravin du Hibou, unit HA4, dated by radiocarbon evi- dence between 8700 and 8100 bp (Huysecom et al. 2004b: 584; Huysecom et al. 2009: 907). But now, Oun- jougou is no longer the southernmost place with pottery as there is some evidence for old pottery in Kenya. At site Zu-4 in Lothagam decorated pottery appeared in a context datable to about 8400 bp (Robbins 1972: 366). At Lowasera a Dotted Wavy Line (DWL) sherd was found in a locality attributable to an age of about 8000 bp (Phillipson 1977: 48). However, the evidence for early ceramics in this region is scarce and about 1000 years younger than the earliest occurrence of pottery in the Saharan region. Even if the number of available radiocarbon dates is still rather small given the large geographical area, two things can be pointed out. Firstly, an independ- ent invention of pottery in different regions has to be considered - in the Central Sahara, the Eastern Sa- hara including the Nile Valley and probably the region around Ounjougou. Secondly, all dates for the earliest pottery cluster in the southern part of the Sahara. In the northern part of the Sahara, the area of the "Capsian- Neolithic" or the Mediterranean facies of the Neolithic, pottery does not appear before the beginning of the 8th millennium bp (cf. Camps 1974). With the exception of Ounjougou, the regions south of the Sahara do not provide any proof of ceramics as old (or older) as the first vessels in the Central and Eastern Sahara. The pottery Pottery seems to appear suddenly in the 10th millennium bp. Interestingly, clay was obviously used for the manu- facture of pots only; no figurines are reported from an early Holocene context. There is one exception: at site Bir Kiseiba E-79-4 a small fragment of a clay bead or a spindle whorl was found in the Lower Cultural Layer (Kobusiewicz 1984: 154). Regarding the pottery, there are no indications for crumbled, dowdy sherds. The pottery always is described as well made indicating a solid mastering of the necessary technologies (cf. Close 1995: 26). The number of sherds (no complete vessels are known) range between three (Bir Kiseiba E-79-8, Connor 1984: 239) and more than 4000 (Sorourab 2, Khabir 1995: 54) (Tab. 1). For the 9th millennium bp the range re- mains similar: one sherd in an in situ context at the site of Nabta Playa E-77-7 (Close &amp; Wendorf 2001: 68), about 1800 sherds at Jebel Umm Marrahi (Elamin &amp; Mohammed-Ali 2004: 103). The amount of pottery found is closely related to conditions of preservation at the site, the extension of the site, the duration of the occupation and, of course, the size of the excavated areas. Nevertheless, the number of sherds gives some indication of the role of pottery for the inhabitants of the site: a large number of sherds points to vessel use in daily life whereas only a few sherds may be seen either as indicators of a more prestigious role of the pottery or as intrusive elements3 or as the result of post- depositional processes. The recorded amounts average around 200 sherds. Small amounts of pottery (less than 50 sherds) are found in contexts of the 10th and 9th millen- nia bp on sites in the Bir Kiseiba / Nabta Playa region, at Ti-n-Torha Two Caves and Ounjougou, Wadi el Akhdar and Abka. Large amounts of sherds (more than 1000) are only recorded from Sorourab 2, Ti-n-Hanakaten and Jebel Umm Marrahi (Tab. 1). 3 The few sherds found at Ti-n-Torha Two Caves are considered an intrusive element within a non-ceramic site (Barich 1987a: 22). The site seems to have been used more as a workshop area and the presence of pottery might be explained with a connection to the site of Ti-n-Torha East (ibid.: 60-61).

Jesse In general, the early pottery is described as well made. The surfaces are smoothed; sometimes a special treatment has been applied as it is described for se- quence 8 in Ti-n-Hanakaten, where a graphite coating is often present on the pottery (Aumassip &amp; Délibrias 1982-1983: 209). For the manufacture of the pots, the use of material either locally available or coming from sources rather close to the site can be supposed. Inves- tigations on the pottery from the Bir Kiseiba / Nabta Playa area or at Sorourab 2 confirm this (Zedeño 2002: 57; Hakem &amp; Khabir 1989: 385). Archaeometrical analysis of sherds of Tagalagal indicates that the pots were not made at the site but within a radius of 75 km at maximum around the site and mostly within a radius of about 25 km. At Adrar Bous 10, most vessels were made at the spot or in the vicinity (Echallier &amp; Roset 1986). At Uan Tabu, clay was procured at different sources, which may be as far away as 70 km (Living- stone Smith 2001: 138). Mineral or organic material or a combination of both was added as tempering agent ( Tab. I)4. Quartz is the most common mineral material, in some cases mica has been added in larger quantities producing a shiny effect on the surfaces (e.g., Uan Afiida, Di Lernia 1999b: 88 or the sites in the Atbara region, Haaland 1995: 93). There is no regional preference for one kind of tempering agent. However, organic material as the only or predominant tempering agent is scarce and recorded at Wadi el Akhdar 83/33 (Schön 1996: 694), Gabrong (pottery in level d, Gabriel 1978: 191) and Ti- n-Hanakaten (Aumassip 2003: 76). For the procurement of raw material such as clay and tempering material a deliberate choice of the technological components was made by the potters. This indicates the mastering of the art and a solid knowledge of the surroundings. Vessels were made using the coiling technique (e.g., Uan Tabu, Livingstone Smith 2001: 151; Atbara region, Haaland 1995: 93). At Amekni and Ti-n-Hana- katen the lower parts of the vessels seem to have been formed by moulding or hammering while the coiling technique was applied for the upper part (Camps 1978: 184; Aumassip 2003: 76). The resulting forms are sim- ple, mostly derived from the spherical, and of varying size. At Tagalagal few vessels show short necks (Roset 2000: 270). The spectrum of different vessel forms is, however, always limited: at Ti-n-Torha East four 4 Mineral and organic tempering agents have different properties. Plant material results in high porosity, which has positive effects regarding thermal shocks when the pots are used for example as cooking vessels (e.g., Rice 1999: 30). For the cooling of liquids, high porosity is also necessary (cf. Arnold 1985: 139). different shapes could be reconstructed for the lower levels (Barich 1974: 82, 84-85, 88, 95-96), at Tagala- gal only two forms (Roset 2000: 270). Reconstructa- ble rim diameters range from 10 to more than 60 cm. Thus there was a broad spectrum of vessels of different sizes whose functional aspects ranged from cooking and storing (usually attributed to larger vessels) to the serving of food or liquids (e.g., Rice 1999: 37). Rim forms are simple and rounded. Wall thickness varies between 4 and 30 mm, but is mostly from 5 to 10 mm. It is related to vessel shape as larger vessels generally have thicker walls, the quality of the raw material, the function of the pot, and, of course, the ability of the potter. In the Atbara region small pots have been found with surprisingly thick walls (unfortunately no detailed measurements are given; Haaland 1995: 93) and in the lower levels (Rinf and Rsup) at Ti-n-Torha East sherds with a wall thickness of not more than 5 mm dominate (Barich 1974: 82, 84-85, 88, 95-96). Decoration is important and usually covers the en- tire surface. Plain sherds are present, but seem to belong to the basal parts of the vessels (e.g., Atbara region, where the very bottom of the vessel is undecorated, Haaland 1995: 84; Ti-n-Torha East, where decoration seems to be limited to the upper part of the vessel, Barich 1987b: 105; or Amekni, Camps 1969: 128). Impression is the most common technique of decoration, incision only seldom occurs. Various combs, spatulas or single- pronged implements were used as tools for decoration. Such tools have been found at different places, the most prominent one is certainly the potter's comb with 14 teeth made of a slim plate of fibrolite from Temet (Roset 1983: 133, 1987: 228, fig. 11.11). Mollusc shells with cut or serrated edges are reported from sites in the Atbara region (Haaland 1995: 84). At Amekni, combs made of wood or bone and a clay object of prismatic shape with serrated edges are interpreted as potter's tools (Camps 1978: 184-185) and abone spatula of about 12 cm length with serrated edges found at Ti-n-Torha Two Caves might have been used for the same purpose (Barich 1987a: 46). Rocker technique was applied, sometimes in its special form of alternately pivoting stamp. Dotted zigzag, mostly serrated, horizontal lines of dots and Dot- ted Wavy Line are the common patterns (Tad. 1). Incised patterns seldom occur and include Wavy Line patterns. Decorative patterns are the most common means to the archaeologist for classification: the dotted zigzag patterns as well as the horizontal lines of impressed dots or dashes are ubiquitous and their ample similarity is not suitable for further differentiation. This is, however, not the case for the Wavy Line patterns. Since Anthony Arkell's first description of Wavy Line (WL) pottery with its two basic varieties, Incised Wavy Line (IWL) 230 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010</page><page sequence="13">Early Pottery in Northern Africa Fig. 2. Wavy Line pottery - a classification (adapted from Jesse 2004: 101, fig. 2). and Dotted Wavy Line (DWL) (Fig. 2 ), on the sites in the Khartoum area (Arkell 1949, 1953), archaeologists have been fascinated by this type of decoration and especially by the wide distribution of the DWL pottery (cf. Sutton 1977; Garcea 1993, 1998; Jesse 2003a, 2003b; Mohammed- Ali &amp; Khabir 2003)5. DWL is known from sites throughout the Sahara, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. IWL is more limited in its distribution and confined to the area be- tween northern Chad and the Red Sea (Fig. 3). In the Central Sahara this pattern is absent6. The number of sites with IWL east of the Nile Valley is rather small, whereas it is much greater in the area between Khartoum and the Atbara. The oldest evidence for IWL in the re- gion between northern Chad and the Nile Valley dates back to the 10th millennium bp (e.g., Sorourab 2, Khabir 1987: 378) and these patterns are present up to the 6th millennium bp (Jesse 2003b: 232-233, fig. 43). 5 Unfortunately, Arkell did not give a precise definition of the term "wavy line" and therefore there has been much confusion using this term. A clear distinction is, however, absolutely necessary to make use of this pattern as a cultural marker (Jesse 2003b: 33-36). 6 In Tagalagal one single sherd has been found, which shows a decoration described as "incision ondulée" (Roset 2000: 285, Planche 2.2). The incised waved lines are, however, very shallow and it is therefore difficult to establish if this is really thought to represent a wavy line pattern. DWL patterns show an even distribution throughout the Sahara (Garcea 1998: 99, fig. 2; Jesse 2003b: 234- 235, fig. 44) and provide a similar time span: the sherds from the Central Sahara date from the 10th millennium bp onwards (e.g., Tagalagal, Roset 1996: 175-176). In the Nile Valley DWL was probably known as well in the 10th millennium bp (Sorourab 2, Khabir 1987: 378) and definitely since the 9th millennium bp (e.g., Abu Darbein and Aneibis, Haaland &amp; Magid 1992: 23, tab. 1; Jebel Umm Marrahi, Elamin &amp; Mohammed- Ali 2004). By close examination of DWL, different kinds of patterns can be distinguished (Fig. 2). Especially the distinction of different types of curves is of particular interest. A characteristic difference is the length of the curves: DWL with long waves (on average 20 to 40 mm) is more common in the Nile Valley, whereas DWL with small waves (7 to 8 mm) is regarded as a typical feature of the Saharan material (cf. Caneva &amp; Marks 1990: 18). In the Central Sahara, the DWL type with small waves is present from the 10th millennium bp onwards (e.g., Tagalagal, Roset 1987: 222, fig. 114). In other areas (e.g., Délébo, northern Chad, Bailloud 1969) this type of DWL does not appear until much later (cf. Jesse 2003b: 284 fig. 52). There is a clear distinction in the distribution of these two different kinds of curves (long waves and small waves): small waves are found in an area including the Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010 231</page><page sequence="14">F. Jesse Fig. 3. The distribution of Incised Wavy Line (IWL) and the different forms of Dotted Wavy Line (DWL) in Northern Africa, 10th to 6th millennium bp (adapted from Jesse 2003a: 39, fig. 4). Central Sahara and northern Chad, long waves are more common in the eastern part of the Sahara and the Nile Valley {cf. Jesse 2003a: 39, fig. 4). There is very little evidence for DWL with small waves in the Khartoum area. In a nutshell, in the Central Sahara, DWL ceram- ics are thus characterised by small waves, whereas in the Nile Valley longer waves are typical. The number of all types of WL sherds is generally not very high compared to the total amount of sherds present at the different sites and WL patterns never con- stitute the majority of the decoration {cf. Jesse 2003b: 241, tab. 68). The presence of WL patterns has thus more likely to be regarded as a cultural marker allowing either for the distinction of different areas of design styles or indicating a special function of pots decorated with WL patterns. Regional differentiation based on the decorative patterns is possible with other decorative elements too. For most sites with early pottery a special focus on the rim zone is noted, often with particular decorative pat- terns being applied here. A small band of plain zigzag is found as decoration in the rim zone on several sherds in the Tadrart Acacus (Fozziagiaren, Di Lernia &amp; Manzi 1999: 237, fig. 19.1; Uan Afuda, Di Lernia 1999a: 142, fig. 15.7; Uan Tabu, Garcea 2001: 106, fig. 7.6.2-3, Livingstone Smith 2001: 133, fig. 8.4, n.144; Ti-n-Torha East, level Rsup, Barich 1974: 83, fig. 39.2). This pattern seems to be confined to the central part of the Sahara, as one further example is known from the site of Adrar Bous 10 (Roset 2000: 285, planche 2.3) and has not been recorded in the Nile Valley. There, "U-shaped notches" occur as a particular rim decoration {e.g., Bir Kiseiba E-79-4, Kobusiewicz 1984: 160, fig. 8.12.c; Aneibis, Haaland 1995: 91, fig. 7; see also Jesse 2003b: 281, fig. 51). An in-depth analysis of the distribution of specific decorative patterns in the early ceramic horizon is still hampered by the lack of detailed publication of the pottery found at several sites. The users of early pottery were pragmatic with re- spect to broken pots. Sherds were reused: at Fozzigiaren, one sherd was found with smoothed edges (Di Lernia &amp; Manzi 1999: 235 and 237, fig. 19.3). At sites in the Atbara region, sherds often show smoothed or deeply grooved edges and may have been used as abraders. Circular pieces with a central hole have been interpreted as fish net-sinkers (Haaland 1995: 94). At Ounjoungou (site Ravin du Hibou) grog is reported as tempering material in one sherd (Huysecom et al. 2004b: 584). The incorporation of old pounded ceramic material in new pots may reflect a special concept of potting. At Uan Afuda, potsherds were sometimes used to delimit fire areas (Di Lernia 1999b: 83). 232 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010</page><page sequence="15">Early Pottery in Northern Africa The context Throughout the Sahara, from about 1 1 ,000 bp onwards, a palaeoenvironment with significant water bodies and a vegetation and fauna of savannah type can be suggested (Petit-Maire &amp; Kröpelin 1991: 209, fig. 54). Early pottery-bearing sites are located in mountainous regions or in areas close to rivers such as the Nile, shortly, in hydrologically favoured areas {Tab. 1 , Fig. 1). Most of them show repeated or long-term occupation which is reflected in the thickness of the cultural layer, the avail- able archaeological material and the radiocarbon dates. Features such as hearths have been preserved on many of the sites. In the Nabta Playa / Bir Kiseiba region pits, sometimes used for storage, are common. Dwellings are indicated by fragments of wattle and daub (e.g. , at site E-80-1, Close 1984: 292 and El Damer, Haaland &amp; Magid 1995: 28-29). Shelters of organic material are also supposed for the site of Amekni (Camps 1969). At the site Nabta Playa E-75-6 remains of huts were excavated and reflect a certain organisational structure of the residents (Krolik &amp; Schild 2001 : 146). Remains of a wooden hut were recovered at Uan Tabu (Mori 1965: 240; Garcea ed. 2001). Stone structures, which have been possibly arranged for habitation, have been found at Ti-n-Hanakaten (Aumassip 2003: 74) and are also known from Uan Afiida and Ti-n-Torha Two Caves (Di Lernia ed. 1999; Barich 1987a: 22). Burials connected with early pottery-bearing oc- cupation have been excavated at Amekni (Camps 1969), Ti-n-Hanakaten (Aumassip 1980-1981: 125-126; Au- massip &amp; Heim 1989), Jebel Umm Marrahi (Elamin &amp; Mohammed- Ali 2004: 99), El Barga (Honegger 2004: 27) and Aneibis and El Damer (Haaland &amp; Magid eds. 1995). At Amekni the burial of a child (hi) excavated in the lowermost deposits in the western sector in a sort of niche was associated with some sherds of pottery, one sherd was placed near the skull (Camps 1969: 40-41, 159). Eleven sherds were found near burial h3 lying in a depth of 1 15 cm directly on the granitic ground in the excavation east of granite bloc A. One sherd was placed near the lower mandible of the adult woman and probably represents some sort of grave offering (ibid.: 159-160, 163). The burials belong to the earliest occupation horizon at Amekni and point to the use of pottery beyond the utilitarian sphere7. A rather sedentary way of life is supposed: the pre- historic people based their subsistence on hunting, fish- ing and gathering. Only for the Nabta Playa / Bir Kiseiba region is the knowledge of domestication and therefore a mixed economy of hunting of hare and gazelle com- bined with cattle pastoralism considered (Gautier 2001 : 631-632). In the Tadrart Acacus, barbary sheep was of great importance for subsistence and a controlled bear- ing might be supposed (Di Lernia 1999a: 147). Wild grasses were collected. Abundant plant remains were found at Nabta Playa E-75-6, among them various kinds of Gramineae such as Echinochloa colona , Panicům tur- gidum and wild sorghum and, most frequently, the seeds of Schouwia purpurea (Krolik &amp; Schild 2001 : 142; Wa- sylikowa 2001). At Uan Afuda, remains of baskets with wild seeds (Brachiaria/Urochloa) have been excavated (Di Lernia 1999b: 125) and plant impressions on three pot sherds found in Layer 2 allowed for the identification of grains of Setaria sp. and Panicům sp. (Magid 1999: 1 85). Plant impressions on sherds of a 9th millennium bp context at Abu Darbein and contexts of around 8000 bp at Aneibis and El Damer could be identified as seeds of wild sorghum (Magid 1995: 158-160). Grinding equip- ment is reported from almost all sites and was certainly also used for the processing of the collected plants. Evidence for other items used as containers are present at several sites: at Ti-n-Hanakaten and Uan Afu- da remains of basketry have been found (Tab. 1). Ostrich eggs were used as containers as well as this was the case at Bir Kiseiba E-79-8 where decorated ostrich eggshell pieces with patterns recalling the Wavy Line pattern on the pottery have been recorded (Connor 1984: 243-246) or at Nabta Playa E-77-7 (Close &amp; Wendorf 2001: 69). Stone vessels are scarce and have been recorded at Tamaya Mellet and Temet8, both sites presenting an Early Holocene occupation with debatable evidence for early pottery use. Concluding remarks All available evidence points to an invention of pottery vessels during the 1 0th millennium bp in Northern Africa. One has to take into account at least two areas of ceramic development: the Central Sahara and the Eastern Sahara (including the Nile Valley). This is not only indicated by 7 The use of earthy material in connection with inhumations is also attested at Ti-n-Hanakaten. The human remains of two adult men (burials HI and H2) very probably were buried in baskets covered with kaolin. Fragments of kaolin were found near the body of H2 (Aumassip &amp; Délibrias 1982-1983: 210). At the site of Khartoum Hospital a large rim sherd with an IWL pattern was used as a pillow in the early burial M2 1(2) (Arkell 1 949: 34; for the sherd see also Plate 59 I and IA). 8 At Tamaya Mellet (site TMY 1 ) stone vessels are associated with the Early Holocene occupation of the 9th millennium bp (Paris et al. 1999 eds.: 130) and at Temet a nearly complete vessel of fibrolite and fragments of at least three further ones were exca- vated. The nearly complete vessel has a rim diameter of about 14 cm and shows traces indicating that it has been used for heating (Roset 2000: 275-276). Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010 233</page><page sequence="16">F. Jesse the radiocarbon evidence but also by different types of decoration such as the different Wavy Line patterns. The new evidence from Ounjougou confirms the assumption of an independent development of pottery in different regions9 and is a first hint at the origin of pottery in the Saharan region. The question of how the Sahara was re-populated at the onset of a more favorable climate at the beginning of the Holocene still awaits a detailed answer. It is supposed that the people came from the periphery of the Sahara still inhabited during the arid phase (Muzzolini 1989: 152). Only in the Nile Valley there is evidence for an unbroken occupation as far south as the second cataract. For other regions, immigration from the south is presumed when the people followed the northward shift of the monsoon belt (Close 1995: 25-26). However, the data base confirming these ideas is very small, and no proof of ceramics older than those mentioned is available from the regions south or north of the Sahara. The only exception is Ounjougou, where sherds were found in a context dated to the early 1 0th mil- lennium bp. However, the ceramic evidence is too small to make detailed correlations based on the pottery design style with more northern sites. Radiocarbon dates of the 10th millennium bp from Ti-n-Hanakaten (Alg-27: 9420 ± 200 bp, Aumassip &amp; Heim 1989: 190) and Site Launey (UW-97: 9210 ± 1 15 bp, Camps et al. 1973: 86) indicate a human presence at the respective place but without pottery. The base layer at Ti-n-Torha East dated to 9080 ± 70 bp (R-1036 alpha) also lacks ceramics, which were introduced there during the 9th millennium bp (Barich 1987b: 102). Thus, pottery often appears after a site was already occupied for some time. With few exceptions all sites with early pottery are situated in mountainous regions or in the Nile Valley, both considered as refuges during periods of extreme aridity (Aumassip 1984: 200). The question whether the re-population of the Sahara is to be explained by immigration after the onset of the Holocene wet phase or whether one has to account for the survival of some human groups in such refuge zones still remains open. In the Adrar Bous and the Tibesti, wet events already occurred from around 13,000 bp onwards (Roset 1996: 178, 2000: 274), thus indicating an earlier start of the lacustrine phase. The favourable situation of mountain- ous areas, which always allowed for human occupa- tion, is well known {cf. Petit-Maire 2002: 86)10. The importance of the high plateaus and the mountainous regions of the Central Sahara for the understanding of the prehistoric development in the Sahara was pointed out early: the so-called "Saharan Fertile Crescent" situated between Darfur and the Gilf Kebir in the east and the Hoggar Mountains in the west "has functioned through time as a zone characterized by migration of plants, animals, and man during times of climatic fluctuation". The higher mountain ranges would have served as refuges for savanna biota during drier periods (Hester 1968: 498, here also the quotation)11. Finally, back to the question: "Why pots?" The benefits of ceramic vessels for cooking and storage have been stressed as being of considerable importance {cf., e.g., Welsby 1997: 27; Haaland 2009). Given the various dimensions of the early pottery recorded in Northern Africa, its use as storage or cooking vessels can certainly be supposed, especially for sites with a larger amount of pottery, for example, sites in the Atbara region {cf Haaland 1995: 116), Ti-n-Hana- katen or Ti-n-Torha East. Unfortunately nothing on the vessels at these sites points to their use on fire; no archaeometrical analysis has been made concerning the contents of the pots. Shallow hemispherical pits surrounding the hearths at site Nabta Playa E-75-6 may have served to hold containers some of which might have been for cooking (Krolik &amp; Schild 2001: 118). But considering the small amount of sherds found at the site, these containers might not have been pottery vessels (Close 1995: 26). As mentioned above, pottery vessels are not the only containers found: baskets, os- trich eggshells and stone vessels have also been used. It is difficult to imagine that on early Holocene sites where no pottery has been found no cooking was done and no storage took place. Thus, pottery played an important role in the culinarian domain but this should not be overemphasised. Pot sherds were found in burial contexts at the site of Amekni. Still today in Africa death often in- volves the breaking of pots (Barley 1994: 92). The low number of pottery sherds present on several sites of the 10th and 9th millennia bp also indicates that pot- tery had its role beyond the pure utilitarian one. At Ti- n-Torha Two Caves pottery certainly had no utilitarian 9 An independent but concurrent invention of pottery in separate regions is also proposed for East Asia: southern China, the Japa- nese Islands and the Russian Far East (Kuzmin 2006: 369). 10 Even in the period of about 1 8,000 bp, the maximum of glaciation, the mountainous regions of the Central Sahara remained „green islands" in a sea of sand (Petit-Maire 2002: map on pp. 22-23). 11 For Ti-n-Hanakaten Ginette Aumassip supposes: "Quant à l'ori- gine des premiers occupants de ces régions, il est probable qu'une partie provienne de l'expansion d'un peuplement que l'aridité a confiné dans des niches écologiques réduites durant des millénai- res. La découverte récente de la phase rupestre « Kel Essuf », la reconnaissance de planchers à auges comme systèmes ingénieux de récupération de l'eau, en sont de solides témoignages. Sont-ils les ultimes avatars des populations atériennes? On ne sait encore répondre." (Aumassip 2003: 78). 234 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 8 (2), 2010</page><page sequence="17">Early Pottery in Northern Africa function, the same might be supposed for some sites in the Nabta Playa / Bir Kiseiba region (Close 1995: 26). Ceramics are also a means to express social sta- tus, wealth, the knowledge of a new technology; in a nutshell, pottery vessels can be prestige objects. The supposed way of subsistence of the different prehis- toric groups certainly influenced the role of pottery. The first settlers of the Tadrart Acacus had a rather nomadic way of life with seasonal habitation sites to coordinate hunting and gathering activities. The sites were seasonally occupied during the winter months (Barich 1987b: 110-111). Also in the Nabta Playa / Bir Kiseiba area the first pottery was used by groups of highly mobile hunter-gatherers, which had some cattle. Here, pottery was certainly more important in the social or ritual context. In contrast, the large sites of the Atbara region indicate a more sedentary way of life, even if seasonality has to be supposed. The amount of pottery is much higher and therefore a predominance of an economic role of the pots (as containers for storage or cooking) can be expected (Haaland 2009). The available evidence points to different centres of pottery invention but common thoughts throughout Northern Africa seemed to have been present given the wide spread of the Wavy Line pattern. Reasons for that are probably best explained ideologically: Wavy Line patterns have often been associated with water (cf. Jesse 2003b: 287). To answer the question of the origin of early pot- tery further evidence is necessary in the areas south of the Sahara - we have to look for more "Ounjougous" - and in the mountainous regions to elucidate their role as possible refuges even during hyperarid times.
