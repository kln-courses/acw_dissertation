<plain_text><page sequence="1">3. SECTION OF LAW AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES. Meetings of the Section were held on October 30, 1944 and November 15, 1944, under the presidency of Professor Rafael Taubenschlag who intro duced the speakers. At the first meeting Professor Ernst Riess, formerly of Hunter College, spoke on "What is Greek Folk Religion" and Professor Jacob Hammer, Hunter College, on "Remarks on Unedited Commentaries on the Prophetia Merlini," at the second meeting Professor C. H. Wolff, 32 The Rape of the Lock, III, 43-50. 33 Moral Essays, I, 71-76. 34 To Augustus, 11-14. 354</page><page sequence="2">University of Michigan, lectured on "Papyrology: Its History and Achieve ments." The three lectures are published below, with a change in Professor Hammer's topic. WHAT IS GREEK FOLK RELIGION? By Professor Ernst Riess Hunter College The term Greek Folk Religion requires a definition. In the usual meaning it refers to the beliefs of the common people, what one might call the lower strata of Greek society. Thus it would chiefly be concerned with the ordinary superstitions of the Greeks, enlarged in scope, perhaps, by the religious rites clustering around the ac tivities of every day life. Such treatment might reasonably be ex pected of me, since I have given practically a life time to the collec tion and interpretation of such usages. Yet I propose to go far beyond this narrow field. In looking over the books which during the last few decades have dealt ex professo with Greek religion we easily see that they fall into several groups. The one making the greatest claim is represented by the names C. F. Moore, The Religious Thought of the Greeks, 1925; U. v. Wilamowitz, Der Glaube der Hellenen, 1931-32; O. Kern, Die Religion der Griechen, 1926-38; Th. Zielinski, La religion de la Grece antique, 1926. All these have in common that their authors are interested in pointing out the ethical height to which Greek religion in its greatest utterances attained. They all emphasize what F. Pfister has called the "Religion der Hoehe" and advert in passing only to the undercurrents which in reality represent the faith of the common people. The acme of this tendency is found in Wilamowitz and Zielinski. The former intentionally neglects the question of sectarianism as expressed in the teachings of the Mysteries and of the Orphics, the latter peremp torily denies the right of the objective investigator to study the history of Greek faith. To him the study of Greek religion is a task which can be carried out only by some one who is himself imbued by religious feeling. To understand and rightly essay Greek religion is a matter of living experience. So he frankly rejects the attitude which looks upon religion as a product of historic develop ment and limits himself to a picture of the Greek beliefs and the Greek cultus as it was at what he considers the culmination of the 355</page><page sequence="3">Greek spirit, roughly the time between 450 and 250 B. C. Even here, though, he allows his preferences to warp his judgment. For while he includes Greek philosophy at Athens to the death of Epicurus, he ignores the revolution in Greek feeling which the radical changes from Hellenic to Hellenistic civilization brought about. Furthermore, he deliberately excludes from his presentation the non-Attic phenomena; so that, while Zielinski's book makes fascinating reading, we must deny that it contributes to the historic understanding which tries to understand how Greek religion de veloped and decayed. A second group of books on Greek religion is distinguished by the common note that they all substitute feeling and intuition for the scientific interpretation of data. Here belong specifically two scholars, W. F. Otto, Die Goetter Griechenlands, 1929, and Dionysos, 1938; and K. Kerenty with his Apollon, 1937, and Das goettliche Kind, 1940; the latter in collaboration with the Swiss psychanalyst, C. G. Jung. The books form part of the Pantheon publications, not all of which luckily are of the same type. Otto's larger book is founded on Homer and his pantheon, a basic mistake, because the Homeric religion is largely,—not entirely as Pfister claims—, some thing never really existing in actual practice, but because of its overwhelming artistry of the greatest influence on the post-Homeric generations. A few quotations must suffice as illustration: While Otto necessarily concedes that Athene may have been a Minoan goddess, her nature nevertheless is not to be understood as a product of historical development; we must follow our internal sense to understand her as a whole. Most significant is the—savage—myth of her birth: it fits and reveals the manly nature of the goddess. To sum her up: Athene is valiant immediacy, saving presence of mind, swift deed; she is the ever-near-one. Similar is the treatment of Apollon and Artemis, who in spite of all we know about the lateness of their kinship are treated together because they resemble each other as only brother and sister can do. He is the revelation of spiritual height; and because he is male, he represents or symbolizes spiritual freedom and distance, which are male perfections. Artemis on the other hand represents female liberty, reflected in nature, but not, in spite of all we know to the contrary, the great holy mother, but the virgin, free nature, innocently pure and, like a real virgin, coy, severe, even cruel. But enough of this and of the whole school, one may say, whose enouncements are uttered with Sibylline cer 356</page><page sequence="4">tainty, but also with Sibylline oracularness. I am happy to know myself one in the absolute rejection of their work with the best English authority on the question, H. J. Rose of St. Andrews. As far as I know there has been only one attempt to study Greek Popular Religion by and for itself, although many single points have been investigated. It is worth mentioning in this connection that precisely here the influence of H. Usener is still a dynamic factor, since almost all the research here referred to is the work of his disciples. Today the most active is M. P. Nilsson, of whose Geschichte der griechischen Religion, meant to take the place of that inexhaustible treasure trove of materials, O. Gruppe's Gr'te chische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte, the first volume has been published. On account of the war conditions I know it only from rather brief reviews. But the position of its author is such that we can expect only sober, well documented statements founded on the widest knowledge of the material and governed by strict criticism. For that reason we welcome his lectures on Greek Popular Religion, published by the American Council of Learned Societies at the end of 1940. Its very brevity is its only defect: for otherwise it covers fairly completely the field of investigation. That it goes beyond these boundaries and covers what to my thinking belongs to official religion (panegyrics, legalism, philosophical attitude to ward religion) must be ascribed to the governing principles of Nilsson's attitude, as he has expressed them again and again, e. g. in his History of Greek Religion, 1925. Attention must also be called to the work of A. B. Cook, whose three volumes of T^eus, 1914-40, go far beyond the indications of the title and contain invaluable, though frequently highly speculative digressions dealing with pop ular beliefs. Finally, I must not forget to mention the trio of German leaders: Radermacher, one of the very few surviving pupils of Usener, Pfister and Weinreich, both of the second generation as disciples of A. Dieterich, Usener's son-in-law and collaborator. We are now in the position to ask, what is folk religion and how can we study it ? In my view folk religion is not identical with folk lore, though this is embraced in its field of materials. Nor is it that religion which emanates from the great poets and thinkers of the Greek people. These have influenced the beliefs of the masses, it is true, to the extent to which at all times and in all na tions the thoughts of their geniuses tend to permeate the national consciousness. Only we must not forget that in this process of dif 357</page><page sequence="5">fusion there takes also place a certain amount of dilution. In anti quity this dilution and transfusion must have been the greater, the longer was the time required for it in an age which lacked the facilities of the printer's press. Nor ought we to overlook the fact that, at least as far as the poets are concerned, they were anxious to achieve success and even to please their customers. We are agreed today that the social and religious picture presented by the Homeric poems is only a travesty of the actual conditions of the heroic age. The poems are addressed to the lords of a feudal society and completely ignore the mass of the population. Were it not for the accidental fact that the genius of Hesiodus sympathized with the lower stratum, from which the poet himself seems to have sprung, we should not know anything of the belief in powerful daemons or of a Zeus of the Earth who blesses the work of the farmer. It is the eternal glory of E. Rohde to have emphasized the fact that by penetrating analysis we can unearth "survivals" of the beliefs held by the great mass of the Greeks between 1200 and 800 B. C. and this glory is but enhanced by the circumstance that the work of the spade, which Rohde excluded from his research, has brought full confirmation to his conclusions. The same principles ought to guide us when we deal with the poets of the fifth century, Pindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Here,—and this holds true particularly of the dramatic writers—another factor also enters. The diverse plays were destined to be performed at a religious contest, financed by the Athenian state and appealed to the entire popula tion. It is surprising enough that the writers were permitted to ex press what are purely personal views regarding the gods. One of the most famous passages from Aeschylus's Oresteia, the one in the Agamemnon where the poet says: "Whoever Zeus is, if this name is dear to him by which he wants to be invoked, thus I'll address him," contradicts the popular conception. We know that the Athenian citizen, together with all other Greeks, clung with superstitious v tenacity to the belief that a god was the more glorious the larger the number of names by which he might be invoked. For Athens alone, the list of epithets used in cultus, as given by Fehrle (LM 6. (671-2) contains 47 certain names and six doubtful ones; for Sparta (1.1. 673) twenty-eight plus two of doubtful certainty. Yet, in spite of these many-sided aspects of the highest god, in spite of the almost monotheistic elevation of Zeus by Aeschylus, as well as by Sophocles ("and none of this, but is Zeus's doing," Trach. end), 358</page><page sequence="6">both of whom are elaborating the conception of Hesiodus that Zeus is the embodiment of justice, the Father of gods and men, the all overpowering king of the heavenly gods, as he is pictured by Homer, Zeus was not the god to whom the Athenians turned in their need. It is significant that we know of only minor sanctuaries of Zeus in Athens, while even Aephaistos had a magnificent temple. We have indeed the huge building begun by Pisistratus in honor of the Olympian, but it is also true that this building lay unfinished for six hundred years, until the time of Hadrian, and that excavation has revealed there not even the trace of an altar. Which sides of Zeus appealed to the common man is shown by the epithets which are given to him in domestic worship: they are Herkeios, the god of the fence surrounding the home, Ktesios, the god of sustenance, and Meilichios, the god who forgives and expiates sins. It is almost superrogatory to talk about these aspects after Sjoevall's exhaustive treatment (Zeus im Hauskult), but it is necessary for the point which I wish to make. Zeus Herkeios had his altar in the open air, in front of the house. Now if this altar were meant for the protector of the family life, equivalent to the Ephestios or Epistios, him of the hearth, the only possible explanation would be that we have here a survival from pre-Hellenic time. It is true (RE, Sup. VI s. v. Hausbau) we can no longer maintain that the fixed hearth within the main room is evidence of northern origin, since such hearths have been found both on the main land and on the islands even from neolithic and chalkolithic times. But the opposite still seems to hold good, that the outdoor fireplace is of mediterranean origin, an assumption which climatic considerations make inherently prob able. At any rate, the whole idea of a fenced-in dwelling place seems to belong to a time not of urban settlements, where house adjoins house, but to a time of isolated farms or at the most, village life. Perhaps it is not too bold to conjecture that the god of the fence was originally the protector of the farmstead in the same way in which among the Romans the Lar, according to Wissowa, was originally the being which protected the boundary of the Roman Farm settlement. I have no doubt that the Herkeios is by nature a "departmental" god. It is significant that even much later eligibility to office depended on the candidate's ability to prove that he owned an altar of the Herkeios, that is, to show that he was a freeholder, or, as we find in some phases of Germanic law, that he owned a "Feuerstelle." It follows that the worship of the Herkeios must 359</page><page sequence="7">have been universal and that the official recognition by the state was but a later sign of legitimation. We hear from Athenaeus that the store rooms of Attic houses were under the protection of Zeus Ktesios and that he was honored by "symbols" (semeia) in the shape of jars, which were kept filled with oil, water and fruits of all kinds. Aeschylus also speaks of an altar of this god and inscriptions prove that his worship was spread all over Greece. Sjoevall, who has also discussed this god extensively, distinguishes three stages in his conception: The first, he thinks, is orendistic; a filled jar is kept in the store room and its magic dynamic force guarantees the maintenance of the store of provisions. Water and oil are added later—in that case I think they are to be explained rationalistically; their addition would keep the contents of the jar fresh—; later the mixture was interpreted as the food of the god, a departmental deity, and the god was imagined to reveal himself in the shape of a snake. For as such we see him on a relief (conveniently accessible in Nilsson's Pop. Rel. fig. 26). In a process discussed by Usener in his Goetternamen the departmental god was subdued as one of the forms of Zeus. Sjoevall's explanation is ingenious but does not carry conviction in every detail. We know of the offering of a pankarpia or panspermia chiefly from agricultural and fertility rites. In the former it was a magical guarantee of the next year's harvest, similar to the well known Eiresione, the branch laden with all sorts of fruit, and to the many north European farm customs discussed in Mannhardt's W aid und Feldkulte. But there is one, to me important, difference: the pankarpia was not kept from one year to the next and then replaced by a fresh offering. In the fertility rites, on the other hand, it was consumed at once and in the cultus of the Ktesios it seems to have been constantly main tained by periodic fresh additions. The snake may have intruded quite naturally, since this animal, as Nilsson has pointed out in his Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, was kept domesticated in the homes and came to be looked on gradually as representing the generative power of the family, which by its appearances promised the continuing existence of the house community. The interesting question is of course why the departmental god was absorbed by Zeus. At first glance he seems far removed from the snake, which even as a house spirit is chthonic in its significance and is apparently an inheritance from beliefs and customs of the pre-Hellenic stratum of the population. It is true that a Chthonic Zeus is mentioned in 360</page><page sequence="8">Hesoid's Works and Days as the god to be invoked at the sowing of the grain. But he is there coupled with Chthonic Demeter, the goddess of the grain or the earth-mother—I am not sure she is not both—and I hazard the opinion that here he has taken the place of the old husband, or lord, of the goddess, Poseidon, as in fact Wilamowitz thinks he has done many times. But all this seems ill adapted to explain the identification of Ktesios with Zeus. Nor are we helped by the fact that Dorians on Kos worshipped a Zeus Pasios, from a root meaning "to gain or acquire," who is therefore commonly identified with the Ktesios. For on the inscription he is connected with the Moirai and the sacrifice offered to them is for male offspring. No testimony, as far as I know, makes the Ktesios responsible for that function, although the Cretan hymn of the Curetes also makes Zeus, the young man, son of Kronos, function for fertility both of crops and cattle and of humans. That, however, is in all probability, a specifically Cretan survival from Minoan times. More definitely chthonic is the Xeus Meilichios, whom we find represented both in human shape, holding a "horn of plenty," and as a snake (for references see the books of Cook and Nilsson). His name characterizes him as the mild or kind one, but that scarcely accounts for all his features. I must here take issue with Pfister, who (RE s. v. Meilichioi Theoi) denies the chthonic character of the god. Yet the nocturnal celebration of these gods, the juxtaposition of Zeus Meilichios with the Enodia, a hypostase of Hecate (Rohde, Psyche I 272, 1) and the holocaust character of the sacrifice at the Diasia festival of the god seem to me to place the chthonic character beyond all doubt. Why these departmental gods were believed to be aspects of Zeus, the heavenly, must remain an unanswered ques tion, unless we assume that Zeus the weather god, whose lightning bolt enters the earth (enelysion), as Kern conjectures, thereby be came localized in the earth as well. However, this is a digression. The point I wanted to make is that, no matter how widely and how deeply the thought of the great poets affected the views of those capable of understanding it—and this gradual sinking down of new thoughts is of course a well known phenomenon—there remained always among the great masses of the Greeks the inherited beliefs and practices. Nor is this due merely to the natural conservatism of the cultus and the jealously maintained tradition of the local sanctuaries. To a con 361</page><page sequence="9">siderable extent we must put the blame on what Naegelein (Welt geschichte des Aberglaubens) calls the thought-laziness of the human species. To this, I think, we must ascribe the fact that the worship of stones and trees or poles could maintain itself alongside the anthropomorphic conception of the deity. It influenced even the great poets themselves. On the altar of refuge, in the Suppliants of Aschylus, we find, side by side with Zeus and Apollon, ap parently (202) a "bird of Zeus," explained by the scholiast as the cock which wakes man at sunrise, but invoked by the Danaids as "the saving beams of the sun": it is evidently a statue of a real bird, a truly theriomorphic presentation. Lines 207 foil, confirm my taking the line literally: the maidens ask "whom of these gods (daimones) shall we further invoke?" And Danaos replies: "I see this trident, the symbol of the god." If the implement can thus be placed on the altar together with iconic representations, we must recognize here a decided survival. It is evident that the same poet in whose thought Zeus occupied an overpowering, almost mono theistic, position was in no way offended by the crudeness of animal and tool. Perhaps nowhere else can we detect so distinctly the deep under current of folk belief running below the elevated thought of a great genius as we can in Thebes, the home of Pindar. There can be no doubt of Pindar's deep and sincere religiosity and of the power of his religious conceptions. Himself of the oldest Theban nobility and steeped in its traditions, he saw in the accidental circumstance that he was born on the day of the Pythian festival a pre-ordained tie to the god of Delphi, whose praises, equalled only by those of Zeus, he never tires of sounding. He refuses to tell evil of the gods, by which he means his refusal to repeat stories of immoralities ascribed to them in myth. He has deep convictions about the ethical side of religion; here he betrays the influence of Orphism, whose acquaintance he seems to have made during his stay in Sicily. Rohde has interpreted these teachings of Pindar in unforgettable words. At the end, though, he himself voices a doubt whether the Pindaric views about the fate of the soul did penetrate into the consciousness of the broad masses. In this I fully agree with him, though I venture to dissent when he sees in the Pindaric verses the sincere conviction of the man himself, a conviction which he had attained by deep reflection. It seems to me that carried away by the pathos and elan of the poet we are apt to overlook that after all he worked on order 362</page><page sequence="10">and that he had to strive for the approval of the victor who had demanded of him a song of praise. We are on different ground in some other utterances of Pindar which show him deeply rooted in folk belief, as e.g. in his proces sional (hyporchema-ballad) on the occasion of a solar eclipse, pre sumably that of April 30, 463, a composition apparently made by command of Theban officials. Here appears the age old belief that the disappearance of the sun is due to theft by some evil power and that prayer (and presumably both sacrifice and magic cere monies) can avert whatever evil is portended. There are also nu merous allusions to popular beliefs throughout the whole body of the poems, of which I have spoken extensively elsewhere (AJP 24.423-40). Now let us compare the picture gained from the study of the poems with what we know of the cultus practices of Thebes. These have been studied in detail and very convincingly by L. Ziehen in RE s.v. Thebai (Boiotien). We may well be surprised to find in the poems very little of what are assuredly the oldest and most prominent cults of the city. To quote briefly from Ziehen's conclusions (1551 foil.): "ancient religious conditions, even sur vivals of a primitive belief, are very marked. There are remnants of fetishism and theriolatry and there are numerous older gods who, in myth, have retreated before the Olympians and have become heroes there, but have remained gods in the cultus. Sometimes they have been more or less completely harmonized with the worship of the younger gods." Since at the beginning of this discussion I spoke of agricultural rites, such as the Eiresione, I may here single out the ceremony called Kopo or the carrying of the laurel. Of this we have a rather detailed description and, as it happens, an Egyptian papyrus find (Oxyrhynchos 659) has preserved for us a maidens' song written for the festival by Pindar, unfortunately in a very fragmentary con dition. The Kopo was a somewhat massive pole of olive wood, too heavy for the boy priest to carry, so that his next of kin, that is his father, for both parents had to be living, took the boy's place. Besides flowers, brass bells, red woollen threads and saffron colored fillets, laurel twigs were wreathed around the pole, from which the ceremony took its name of daphnephoria. The laurel is sacred to Apollon. That originally the god himself was believed to be present in the laurel, as is the corn demon in the sheaf and the vegetation demon in the May tree, becomes clear from the fact that the boy 363</page><page sequence="11">had to keep touching the twigs, by which gesture, well known from primitive ritual as well as from the Jewish synagogue service, the power or orenda of the numerous bough is transferred to the human being. And so Pindar says in the song, according to what seems a certain restitution: "Loxias has come, graciously to bestow undying benefit on Thebes." As a matter of fact we hear that Pindar's own son, Daiphantos, once functioned as the boy priest and we can safely assume that the poet himself assisted then at the ceremony. The ceremonial thus shows an incomplete merging of two originally independent cult acts, a merging favored by the circumstance that both the May tree and the laurel twig were believed to guarantee, the one fertility, the other the purity prerequisite to a successful agricultural undertaking. I hope that these somewhat discursive statements have made clear why I believe that so far no fully satisfying exposition of Greek Folk Religion has been made. Perhaps it will contribute to this desirable achievement if I briefly sketch what I conceive should be the guiding principles of such investigation and the method to be pursued. In the first place we must keep in mind that the "basic forms of religious thought," as Usener and Dieterich have called them, are universal. It is here that the value of anthropological and ethnolo gical data should be recognized by the student. I am far from deny ing that this involves great danger, to which chiefly the English rep resentatives of this form of research have exposed themselves. For while the analogies offered by the "primitives" often illuminate the thought process, they just as often obscure it. It seems to me that we should make allowance for the different conditions in which each of the peoples considered carried on its existence. For if it is true, as I am convinced it is, that religion has its origins in the needs and desires of man, then we must recognize that the "milieu" is the most formative element in the wished-for satisfaction of these needs. I cannot concede that Frazer's fascinating theory of the growth of religion out of the experience that the original magic view has as many failures, if not more, than it has successes, is justified. For carried to its ultimate consequences, the frequent inefficiency of prayer and sacrifice can only lead to the complete negation of any power higher than that of man himself, in other words, it must end either in atheism or the confidence in the power of humans to control events in nature, that is in a return to the principles of 364</page><page sequence="12">magic. On the other hand, actual experience shows that the individual meets, in some way or other, moments when his own strength is insufficient for his needs or when his desires conflict with the cir cumstances surrounding him. He may then find a way out of his dilemma, which appears to him to have been revealed to him mi raculously, i. e. beyond his understanding of cause and effect, or he may find himself completely frustrated, in which case his previous experiences make him blame a stronger power, invisible to him, for his failure. Thus there arises the certainty of powers beyond man, both beneficent and malevolent. It is this experience with its conse quences to which R. Otto has given the high sounding names of "numinosum, fascinosum, mysterium tremendum." Otto, who is interested in the religious feeling to the almost total exclusion of the manifestation of that feeling, does not discuss the question how the spiritual experience is translated into the religious act nor how it can lead to the assumption of beings of higher power, that is gods. Here, I think, is also the weak point in the thinking of those who, with Fowler in the field of Roman religion and with Pfister in the Greek, assume that the orenda-stage forms the ground from which the belief in gods has grown. I am far from denying that the "religious experience" lies first in the meeting with an unknown power. But I think that the advocates of this theory ascribe too much abstract thought to primitive man, who, so far as I can gather from anthropological reports, thinks at all times in purely concrete instances and who therefore sees in this stone or piece of wood, that beast, the helper or hinderer. Perhaps an experience told by Wilamowitz will help to make my meaning clearer. It has puzzled scholars why Pan the Arcadian god of the herds, should have been imagined to have goatish features, instead of the human ones of the herder. Wilamowitz tells how he was riding on a lonely mountain path in Arcadia, when suddenly at a turn in the road an old he-goat thrust his face through the bushes above him. "There," he says, "I verily saw the god." The second difficulty besetting our research is that of historical development. It goes without saying that the study of religion is a part of the study of history, so that evidently we can describe at a given moment only the religion of that moment. The aim of perfec tion naturally would be to unite these mosaic fragments so that they form a complete moving picture, in which the progress or retrogres sion made during each period is shown and, if possible, the causes 365</page><page sequence="13">made clear for such changes. So much is conceded by all students of religious history; but the method to achieve it is controversial. Some hold with Otfried Mueller that we ought to study the religion of each Greek or Italic locality. A beginning has been made by Im merwahr in his Arcadian Cults and by Wide in his Cults of Laconia. Ziehen, too, in his deep digging studies of the cults of Sparta and Thebes in the RE seems to belong to this school, as do in general the careful cult enumerations for each separate place in that monu mental work. So, too, the American Academy in Rome seems to favor this method, if one may judge by Peterson's Cults of Campania and Taylor's Cults of Etruria. It cannot be denied that excellent collections of material have resulted from these studies. But so far a synthesis is lacking. On the other hand, scholars have been interested in pursuing the worship of a god through the whole of the Greek speaking world to draw from it conclusions as to spread and univer sality. The pitfall to which such studies are open is this: the spread of the cult may be due to causes which are revealed neither in literature nor by inscriptions, causes based on individual experience; I instance the establishment of Sarapis worship on Delos on the basis of a dream vision. For us, who wish to know whom the masses worship, there is also the objection that most of our source material deals with official religion and reveals nothing about the strength or weakness of its hold on the great body of the people. Lastly, I think too many of our scholars enter upon their investigations with a thorough bias in favor of admiring the Hellenes. Quite naturally so, for who could help loving and admiring the Greeks, who has been deeply influenced by their poets and philosophers or has had his emotions roused by the remains of their art. In this bias I see the fundamental weakness of both Wilamowitz and Kern. For the former, only he who has come to believe with the Greeks is able to understand Greek religion, a view point dangerously close to that of Zielinski discussed by me earlier. As for Kern, his repeated emphasis on the saying of Philip of Opous that everything foreign which the Greeks have touched they have made more perfect and more beautiful disqualifies him in my opinion as a proper judge of Greek religion. I am touching here on a radical difference between these great scholars and myself. In his Religion der Griechen Pfister stresses that the object of the study of Greek religion is not to evaluate it in comparison either with one's own beliefs or with other pagan religions. It is merely to give the facts and to try to understand 366</page><page sequence="14">why these facts satisfied the religious needs of the Greeks. In full agreement with this, I draw the further consequence that it is not our duty to emphasize those aspects of Greek religion which cor respond to our own esthetic cravings, but to stress equally those which repel the modern man. Perhaps my attention to Greek super stition has biased me also. But where others speak with joyous ap preciation of the Hellenic ability to vivify nature with Nymphs, Silens, Satyrs, I see a Greek haunted by the dread of spirits, afraid of the noon quiet lest Pan avenge himself, afraid of the night in which spectres roam that sicken him by their touch, afraid in his home of the child-snatching Striges, afraid on the road of Hecate's rout, afraid at stream and in glade lest a nymph snatch him away or cause him to go insane, not to mention that the croaking of a raven, or the weasel crossing his path, may mar the success of what ever he has set out to do. I have intentionally somewhat exaggerated these haunting fears. But it cannot be denied that they existed and the fact that enlightered Greeks themselves scoffed at them only proves how firmly rooted they were in the souls of the mass of the people. I shall attempt to sum up briefly what I think should be done to paint a true picture. First, we ought to collect from literature all we can learn about popular beliefs. Much has already been done here, but the task far surpasses the strength of any individual. What I said in 1895 (TAPA) that a group of scholars ought to combine and do the work in the way in which Indices are nowadays made, still holds good at this date. This material ought then to be arranged chronolog ically, so we may see what is peculiar to certain periods and what is of general import. In the meantime, others ought to perform the same task for inscriptional and monumental evidence, specifically numismatic. This would enable us to control the chronological ar rangement and at the same time permit a geographical distribution, to throw light on the peculiarities of the diverse tribes. Next the material must be sifted regarding to what is native Greek, what belongs to foreigners and their creeds, and how such borrowings may have been remodelled or have in their turn helped to alter native conceptions. All this evidence must then be sifted again, this time for possible changes brought about by political and even more by economic developments and upheavals. Three periods appear to me as particularly important: first the prehistoric one, so to be called at least until we have deciphered Minoan. For the northern im 367</page><page sequence="15">migrants found in the Balkan peninsula a people of high civilization, whom they conquered or drove back, but to whose culture they suc cumbed in large measure. Here the work done by Nilsson is in valuable, but it is merely a beginning. More than elsewhere we must here be on our guard lest we approach the material with preconceived notions. Nor ought we to forget that even to a greater degree than usual it is largely the belongings of princes and nobles which have come down to us and that we must therefore be extremely cautious in drawing conclusions for the mass of the people. Since most of our evidence comes from graves, attention will be centered on the after life. For this we lack as yet a "Graeberkunde" such as Duhn and Messerschmidt have furnished for Italy. Furthermore, the Balkan peninsula and the Aegaean islands have so far failed to show any traces of paleaolithic times. Yet the Minoan people must surely once have gone through that stage of civilization. Did they then—and this appears very probable—go through it in a different locality ? And where was it ? This casts us at once into the vortex of the controversy between the advocates of an East to West move ment, as it is perhaps indicated by the finds of the Near East, and between the advocates of the opposite direction, of whom Schuch hardt is the foremost. It is not for the classicist to make the decision; he must rely on the prehistorian. The second period of important changes is, I think, that between 700 and 600 B. C. Hesiodus, and even the Odyssey, allow us a glimpse into the rising opposition of the peasantry against the feudalism of the Iliad. Hand in hand with this economic struggle there goes the growth of individualism, which culminates in the sudden and dazzling rise of lyric poetry. Did this assertion of self and the baring of one's soul parallel a corresponding growth in the depth of religious ex perience? The coming of Dionysiac enthusiasm, quite evidently fought bitterly by the ruling class, and the rise of Orphism seem to point in this direction. Perhaps the growth of the Eleusinian mysteries, from a very limited circle stemming from Mycenaean times to a religion promising a better life to an ever widening group of devotees, may also be ascribed to actual, individual experiences. The third important change seems to me conditioned to a much greater extent by economic revolution. The terrible thirty years' struggle of the Peloponnesian War destroyed to a large extent the naive faith in the gods as protectors of the state and its citizens. Thucydides has summed up in masterly fashion the great break 368</page><page sequence="16">caused by the plague at the beginning. The Frogs and the Ploutos of Aristophanes show its effect at its end and a few years later Critias's judgment that religion is a human invention for the control of the masses shows how much the belief in the official gods had weakened. It is generally conceded that the expenditures by states and private individuals for rebuilding or new erection of temples only mask this important change. Worse was still to come when Alexander's conquest of the Orient thoroughly upset the economic balance.of the Eastern Mediterranean. Rostovzeff's work on the economic history of this period ought to be mastered by any one who wishes to understand what this change meant for religion. We have seen in our own days the growth of mysticism and superstition brougth about by the upheaval of the First World War and we may predict a much stronger growth after the end of the present one. The published histories of Greek religion pay far too much attention to the philosophies of the time and far too little to the impact which the new orientation must have made on existing beliefs. Even books of such deep insight as Reitzenstein's Mysterienreligionen and Nock's Conversion neglect this aspect of the development completely.</page></plain_text>
