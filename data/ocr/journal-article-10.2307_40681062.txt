O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings, That I may awake Albion from his long 8c cold repose; For Bacon 8c Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang Like iron scourges over Albion: Reasonings like vast Serpents Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations. William Blake, Jerusalem Plate 15 I The steadily increasing recognition that Shaw is a serious religious artist acts as a much-needed corrective to erroneous representations of him as a rationalist, or a comic writer, or a dramatist who merely plays with ideas and has no consistent point of view. Similarly, the critical recognition in the twentieth century that William Blake's art shows him to be a systematic and intelligent recreator of archetypes destroys the superstitious opinion of him, especially in the role of the author of the "Prophetic" books, as a mad mystic who rejected all things pertaining to materialism, form and order. As both writers have been increasingly recognized for the well-balanced artist-philosophers they are, critical opinion has correspondingly opened its eyes to the kinship between them that is emphasized by Shaw's own direct references to Blake in his writings and, more to the point as regards this essay, by a comparative study of their works.2 My purpose here is to show that the religious implications oí Back to Methuselah are understood well when the play is analyzed in terms of Blake's Jerusalem, and when we see that a major concern of Shaw's play, like that of Blake's poem, is to recreate biblical stories so as to make them "live again"3 for audiences of their time. Back to Methuselah is Shaw's magnum opus, and essential for understanding his religious</page><page sequence="2">142 VALLI RAO vision, as has been recognized by some critics.4 In the main, however, it is still Shaw's least liked and least understood major play. Even critics who defend Shaw's art and philosophy in his other plays find Back to Methuselah acceptable only as his worst play.D A reading of Back to Methuselah in terms of Blake's magnum opus, Jerusalem, will, I hope, contribute towards a better understanding of the play that Shaw in 1944 chose as his "world classic." II . . . the votary of Creative Evolution goes back to the old and very pregnant lesson that in the beginning was the Thought; and the Thought was with God; and the Thought was God, the Thought being what the Greeks meant by "the Word". He believes in the thought made flesh as the first step in the main process of Creative Evolution. He believes in a New Jerusalem, and resolves, like Blake, that he will not cease from mental fight nor shall his sword sleep in his hand till he has built that paradise in England's green and pleasant land. [Postscript to Back to Methuselah] Back to Methuselah (written between 1918 and 1920) and Jerusalem (writ- ten between 1804 and 1820) are protests against the deterministic and mechanistic religionlessness that led to the wars immediately preceding the writing of both works. Shaw and Blake fit that lack of religion into their visions of the world's history seen in terms of the biblical myth of man's fall from Eden and, most importantly, they show their warring contemporaries where to look for a vital religion that will redeem the world. The biblical story of man's fall and redemption is interpreted in an identical spirit by Shaw and Blake, and the "system" that Blake creates out of his reading of the story may be used profitably to analyze Shaw's understanding of it too. The Blakean interpretation of biblical archetypes involves so rich and strange a transformation of the ortho- dox understanding of them that a sketch of its main outline must be given before we go on to study Back to Methuselah in terms oí Jerusalem. The starting point in Blake's myth is that Albion (who represents all mankind) has his spiritual existence in the Word of God. In his unfal- len spiritual wholeness he lives in Eden, where there are two regions, one the City of God (which is Jerusalem) and the other the "garden of God."6 The two are analyzed by Northrop Frye: "a sunlit city and a moonlit garden, a golden summer of energy and a silver winter of repose."7 The city of Eden symbolizes action and creation. Here the imagination of man revels in the mental Hunting and War which are "the two sources of Life in Eternity" (J 38:31; cf. Milton 35:2). The moonlit garden symbolizes contemplation, and admiration for what has</page><page sequence="3">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 143 been created, and repose during which energy is gathered for further creation. This garden is the Garden of Eden described in Genesis, and called Beulah in Blake. It is, as we shall see, the place where the physi- cal body of man, along with the world of nature, is created. Both the active and the passive phases of Eden are essential for the imagination which creates. But in Beulah, creation is viewed as separate from creator, and there is the danger that if Albion reposes too long in this state, the passivity of his creative imagination will lead to spiritual sleep. The fall of man is Albion's fall from Edenic creativity to passive contemplation when he stays too long in Beulah. One important conse- quence of the fall is the illusory appearance of a non-human power outside Albion's mind, and Albion's worship of that power. He begins to worship an external God, forgetting that the kingdom of God is within him. With his fall, "the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion" (J 27). Albion's senses "behold what is within now seen without" (The Four Zoas 11:54-55). In Eternity, Albion's emanation (his feminine counterpart) is part of him: "In Eternity Woman is the Ema- nation of Man; she has No Will of her own. There is no such thing in Eternity as a Female Will" (A Vision of the Last Judgment, p. 85; Keynes, p. 613). With the Fall, his emanation appears as an external Nature instead of as his creation. In this context, Frye writes: There are several accounts of the Fall in Blake . . . the invariable charac- teristic of them is Albion's relapse from active creative energy to passiv- ity. This passivity takes the form of wonder or awe at the world he has created, which in eternity he sees as a woman. . . . Once he takes the fatal step of thinking the object-world independent of him, Albion sinks into a sleep symbolizing the passivity of his mind, and his creation sepa- rates and becomes the "female will" or Mother Nature, the remote and inaccessible universe of tantalizing mystery we now see. [Fearful Symme- try, p. 126] In Eternity, Albion exists in a fourfold wholeness represented by the harmonious existence of the four Zoas in him. They are, in Blake's myth, "the Four Eternal Senses of Man" (J 36, 98) and "the Four Rivers of the Water of Life" (J 98). In The Four Zoas, Albion's fall is seen in terms of his dismemberment through the fall of his Zoas into disunity and war. Thomas R. Frosch explains how [Albion's] fall takes the form of a compartmentalization of his body into the fundamental energies, or Zoas, that together, like a chariot, once bore his existence "from Eternity to Eternity." Now, in their fragmenta- tion, these energies - Orc-Luvah (the emotional faculty and the sense of smell), Los-Urthona (the imagination and the sense of hearing), Urizen (thé analytical intellect and the sense of sight), and Tharmas (the sense</page><page sequence="4">144 VALLI RAO of touch and the body as a functioning unit) - go their separate ways as the clashing dimensions, categories, and ideologies of fallen history, as well as its emotional conflicts and its wars. When the Giant Forms re- nounce their participation in Albion's unity, the capability of each is reduced to his own selfhood, or spectre, and the cosmic man is left powerless, asleep on his rock, the geographical England, in the middle of the ocean. . . . Blake associates each Zoa with a female form, or ema- nation, who embodies the achievement of his energy: Vala, the relation- ship of Luvah; Enitharmon, the creation of Los; Ahania, the compre- hension of Urizen; and Enion, the act of Tharmas. In their Unfällen integration, these four are the members of Jerusalem, the emanation of Albion's risen body, or his total liberty and fulfillment. But when the Zoas separate from Albion and from each other as spectres, the emana- tions fall away from Jerusalem to become what Blake calls shadows . . . once the emanation is separated from the Zoa, she assumes a life and initiative of her own, gaining primacy over the spectre, who is suddenly confronted with an otherness completely independent of himself: the shadow of Jerusalem, or man's creative liberty, is Rahab-Babylon, or man's enslavement to nature.8 A fallen Zoa in his spectral state represents qualities which are di- rectly opposed to those he represents in his Unfällen state. Urizen, as Nights III and IV of The Four Zoas detail, falls from a state of intellect or reason to its opposite, false reason or ratiocination. Luvah, who represents man's "capacity for love and joy" (Fearful Symmetry, p. 274) initiates the fall when he externalizes and loves passively his emanation Vala, the goddess Nature whose name Blake used as the original title of The Four Zoas. Tharmas in Eden is man's power to create life. At his fall in Beulah, his emanation Enion separates from him and he becomes the Spectre of Tharmas who draws man toward total material chaos, the waters of death and annihilation. The fourth Zoa, Urthona, ap- pears in the fallen world as Los. The development of Blake's concept of Los, and Los's relationship with his emanation Enitharmon (who repre- sents the Female Will) and his Spectre (the Spectre of Urthona, as he is generally called), is a good illustration to demonstrate how Blake's vi- sion, like Shaw's, is never static: they work and rework their archetypes continually, according to their developing visions. The early Blake and Shaw view the Female Will as the power that keeps man imprisoned in the natural world and prevents his return to spiritual life in Eden.9 Gradually, as their artistic visions mature, Blake and Shaw work their way to the view that the natural world represents not merely the destructive Female Will who prevents man's ascent to the Unfällen world; they see her as also being the redemptive power who, by keeping man in the fallen, natural world of time and space, prevents him from falling beyond the natural world into chaos or Non-</page><page sequence="5">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 145 Entity, and allows for evolution towards the Unfällen world. These two aspects of the Female Will are first clearly discerned by Blake and Shaw by the time they have written The Four Zoas (ca. 1796-1807) and Man and Superman (1901-1903) respectively. In The Four Zoas, Blake comes to see Los as the regenerative power in the world of time and space, where he works to rebuild the body of Albion from the fallen natural life he now is, back to eternal life. The world of space is represented by Enitharmon, that of time by the Spectre of Urthona, and The Four Zoas sees that both are constructive only insofar as they work in subservience to Los; conversely, Los is constructive only when he works in control of Enitharmon and the Spectre, making them co-operate with his will and do his bidding. When not subservient to Los, Enitharmon works with the Spectre of Urthona. Then she represents the independent Female Will who, in the form of the material world that stretches endlessly in space and surrounds man, strives to maintain endlessly recurring cycles of natural life bound to the "vegetable world" as Blake calls it in his Descriptive Catalogue (Keynes, p. 570). Violet in Man and Superman is the Shavian counterpart of the independent Female Will in The Four Zoas. Her attitude to her lover and husband Hector is the attitude of the Female Will who wants man to be a child in her hands for ever: she wants Hector as a domestic pet rather than as a working man ("Do you mean to work? Do you want to spoil our marriage?" she asks, in Act II), spending his energy in passive worship of her as the goddess Vala rather than in the active pursuit of man's aspirations towards spiritual life. In contrast to the independent Female Will who wants to keep man in nature for ever, is Enitharmon in The Four Zoas when she works with Los to provide protective spaces for the fallen Albion: in this circum- stance, natural life becomes an act of mercy which protects man from further fall (towards chaos) and which allows for the redemption of man back to eternal life. This is the situation in which Los, in Chapter I of Jerusalem, builds the redeeming world of Generation to limit man's fall into the unmeasurable and indefinite chaos where Albion's mem- bers murder one another; and we will see that it is also the spirit in which Part I of Back to Methuselah, "In the Beginning" (set in the Garden of Eden), deals with the establishment of the redemptive mira- cle of natural sex, birth and death in the midst of unbounded time and space and war. According to the Blakean myth, when natural life is a redemptive factor in the fallen world then the spirit of Jesus, working through Los, establishes the Limit of Opacity and the Limit of Contraction, which are the lowest limits to which man can fall in death and life respectively</page><page sequence="6">146 VALLI RAO (see The Four Zoas IV: 271-73; Milton 29; J 35, 42). Los "binds" Urizen and gives him the form of Satan or death, the lowest form to which life can sink before being renewed again. The Limit of Contraction is Adam, or life on the natural plane, the lowest limit to which Albion can descend in his fallen life. Fallen man, living and dying as the physical body, is Ore or Luvah, and natural life is maintained in successive Orc-Urizen cycles of life and death in the world of Generation. One of the crucial ways in which natural life, maintained by the Female Will under Los's guidance, provides the point of redemption from flesh to spirit, is that it allows for the evolution of Jesus "in the Robes of Luvah" (that is, as fallen man), who comes to the fallen world to redeem the sleeping Albion (see The Four Zoas VIII: 182-97; 260-65). Ann White- field and Ana in Man and Superman are representative of the benevo- lent Female Will working with Los (that is, for the Shavian Life Force), and the breeding of the superman is the counterpart of the birth of Jesus in our world of Generation. Every one of Los's imaginative creations, achieved with the help of his emanation and spectre, contributes to the building of Golgonooza. Golgonooza is Los's City of "Art &amp; Manufacture" (Milton 24) and "it contains, or consists of, the physical bodies of man and woman."10 Los is the artistic and evolutionary urge in mankind, and to say that he must work with his spectre and emanation, in time and space, means that in the fallen world these forces must work with material and natural forces, the spiritual must find expression through the mate- rial, and eternity must work through time and space for there is no other outlet for it as long as the world is a fallen one. We have so far discussed chiefly Los's building of Golgonooza with the help of his emanation. Blake conceives of the notion of the Spectre of Urthona for the first time as he writes The Four Zoas (Shaw's "New Man" Enry Straker is the parallel in Man and Superman), and in the process of writing the poem he deepens his understanding of this concept, see- ing the vital importance of the fact that Los must work in space (with Enitharmon) as well as in time (with the Spectre of Urthona). Golgo- nooza is always built with the help of both spectre and emanation, but the emphasis shifts from Los's relationship with his emanation to Los's relationship with his spectre, between the writing of The Four Zoas and Jerusalem. We will note later how a similar shift is involved in Shaw's use of the superman myth in Man and Superman, and the longevity myth in Back to Methuselah. For the sake of understanding the significance of the myth of longev- ity in Back to Methuselah, it is valuable to understand clearly the role of the Spectre of Urthona in Los's schemes for the redemption of the fallen Albion. Frye in Fearful Symmetry (pp. 292-99) provides a basic</page><page sequence="7">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 147 account of the Spectre of Urthona as clocktime and as the will, an account which is useful for understanding the parallel between Los's working with his spectre in Jerusalem and Franklyn's working with Con- rad in Back to Methuselah. Frye explains how Los represents an imagina- tive concept of time and his spectre represents an abstract concept of time, clocktime: the Spectre of Urthona "is that aspect of existence in time which is linear rather than organic or imaginative. If one had to pin the conception down to a single word, one might call Blake's Spectre of Urthona the will" (Fearful Symmetry, p. 292). The Spectre, Frye goes on to explain, is an instrument which, when not controlled by Los as man's Imagination, is automatically attached to Luvah as man's Selfhood (the state of Satan or death, as Milton 29 and Jerusalem 33 and 48 inform us): . . . there is a perpetual conflict between the imagination [Los] and the will [The Spectre of Urthona] to prevent the latter from deserting to the Selfhood, and there can be no free will ... as the will must be attached to one or the other . . . The Spectre of Urthona, properly controlled, is the obedient demon who brings his master Los the fire and metals and other physical needs of culture, and brings the artist his technical skill. Whenever Los has a higher status for man in view the Spectre produces the appropriate tools, an alphabet, a printing press, a wheel or a com- pass. But once separated from creative and imaginative ends, the instru- mental becomes an end in itself. . . . Energy becomes linear and form- less, directed along the clock time of fallen life, and as that time is pitifully short, the Spectre crowds Los out, takes charge of civilization and drives it along in a steadily accelerating stampede of hysterical fear. [Fearful Symmetry, p. 294] We have noted that the creation of Straker in Man and Superman represents the Shavian recognition of the concept of the Spectre of Urthona. He is a symbol of the Spectre of Urthona not under the control of the Imagination, and as such attached to the natural man. Straker driving furiously over unending stretches of miles with his terrified employer in the back seat is a perfect symbol of the Spectre of Urthona racing through clocktime. Straker is the Spectre who is not guided by Los to use his ability; a good craftsman left without guid- ance, the height of his destiny is breaking motoring records, a symbol of the suicidal waste of energy with which the Spectre, to complete the quotation from Frye above, "drives [civilization] along in a steadily accelerating stampede of hysterical fear ... [a fear which] is fundamen- tally the panic inspired by clock time, the Chronos who devours his children" {Fearful Symmetry, p. 294). We have not space here to discuss how Blake's changing attitude to Urizen and the Spectre of Urthona in The Four Zoas is also part of Shaw's developing vision in Man and Super-</page><page sequence="8">148 VALLI RAO man, as Ramsden and Straker, opponents of Tanner-Ore, are trans- formed into the Statue who is subservient to Juan-Los in the Hell Scene. It is appropriate to note here, however, that the idea of the Spectre of Urthona as an instrument that works for both Los and the Selfhood, an idea that is one of the central themes in Jerusalem and Back to Methuselah, has its germ in The Four Zoas and Man and Superman. The state of Selfhood or Satan is represented in Back to Methuselah by Neo-Darwinism and in Jerusalem by Newtonian materialism, and the attempt in both works is to make the Spectre of Urthona serve man's imaginative and evolutionary appetite rather than the Newtonian or Darwinian Selfhood. Shaw champions the religion of Creative Evolu- tion against the Neo-Darwinian religion of Circumstantial Selection (as Shaw prefers to call what is usually called Natural Selection) prevalent in his day, just as Blake in Jerusalem puts the case for his vision of Christianity against the Newtonian and Lockian Deism that prevailed in his day. Essentially, Shaw's and Blake's attitudes to Newton and Darwin as the Selfhood are identical.11 Neither rejects his antagonist outright. Both accept the observations of their antagonists, Blake that there ex- ists in the fallen world a vast spatial Nature around man, and Shaw that natural life and habits evolve in time. But both point to the absence of an intelligent agency in their antagonists' philosophies regarding Na- ture, and both try to show how they could be modified so as to provide men with a sense of religious purpose and faith which alone can, in Shaw's and Blake's views, lead to a better world. In the Preface to Back to Methuselah, Shaw calls Darwinian Natural Selection "nothing less than the bottomless pit, now [with Neo- Darwinism] become a very real terror."12 The angel of the bottomless pit, called Apollyon in Revelation (9.11), is one of the dark disasters that appear before the dawn of apocalypse. Bunyan's account in The Pilgrims Progress of how Apollyon nearly overcomes Christian in the Valley of Humiliation, before Christian at the last minute wounds Apollyon with his own sword, no doubt influenced both Shaw and Blake, with their Apollyon being, in Shaw's case Neo-Darwinism and in Blake's case Newtonian Deism. Los sees . . . the finger of God go forth Upon my Furnaces from within the Wheels of Albion's Sons, Fixing their Systems permanent, by mathematic power Giving a body to Falsehood that it may be cast off for ever, With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his own bow. 1/12] Apollyon's bow is a symbol of the Spectre of Urthona who belongs naturally to the Selfhood (Apollyon) but may be used with equal skill by</page><page sequence="9">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 149 Los (Bunyan's Christian). In the context of Back to Methuselah, the biolo- gist August Weismann (that is, his theory of Death as a result of Cir- cumstantial Selection) is by nature Neo-Darwinian but used skilfully by Shaw against Neo-Darwinism, as we shall see in the course of this essay.13 Los's working with the Spectre of Urthona and the Selfhood to give "a body to Falsehood that it may be cast off for ever" involves the triumph of materialism up to the point where it defeats itself by reveal- ing itself as error and its opposite as truth. This is one of the ways through which Jesus redeems Albion, in Blake's myth. We have seen that in the fallen world, eternity must work in time and space, and Jesus' coming to the world as natural man is symbolic precisely of this. Jesus is killed as an Ore figure and then the body crucified on the "Tree of Mystery" (The Four Zoas VIII: 326) is worshipped as God, although it represents the material body of death which is in reality the Selfhood and Antichrist (J 89). Blake sees the dead body on the cross as worshipped first by the orthodox religionist in the name of Mystery, then by the Deist in the name of natural religion and natural morality, and lastly worshipped unashamedly and openly in the name of An- tichrist and complete materialism. When it is clearly seen as Antichrist, then Albion clearly recognizes its opposite, Christ. Such a recognition is based on the principle which Frye calls an "analogy" (based on Blake's use of the term "Divine Analogy" m Jerusalem 49:58, 85:7) to explain how the Selfhood sets up a parody of the imagination. The physical fight of the hero parodies the mental fight of the artist; the jealous wife and teasing mistress parody the emanation; money and morality parody the community of minds; the ghost or nightmare parodies the vision. This pattern of superficial resemblance combined with profound contrast, the illustration of the doctrine that truth clarifies error into the negation of itself, reaches its culmination in the parody of Christ [the living Word of God] by Antichrist [the dead body on the cross]. [Fearful Symmetry, p. 78] Much of Chapter 1 1 of Fearful Symmetry (see pp. 382-403) is devoted to explaining clearly the significance of the "analogy" as "a parody or inverted form of the imaginative world" and a "mirror-image, 'Vege- table Glass' as Blake calls it [A Vision of the Last Judgment, pp. 69-70], of the world of mental reality." The more clearly this Vegetable Glass reflects an error, the more clearly it reveals the opposite truth, and when it clearly reflects Antichrist, it clearly reveals the Christ of whom Antichrist is an "analogy" or demonic parody. Then the dead body of Jesus is seen as representing the Selfhood of man, whose ultimate form Blake identifies as the biblical Covering Cherub (J 89, 96). In Jerusalem,</page><page sequence="10">150 VALLI RAO the Covering Cherub's form discloses that behind its militant front is contained Rahab, the independent Female Will who is the natural world at the heart of Antichrist, and who is an "analogy" of Jerusalem, the bride of Christ. At the end of Jerusalem, Albion is redeemed from worship of the dead Satanic body which he had mistaken for the true Jesus. He sees that the true God is not the historical Jesus who was crucified as Ore and whose physical resurrection is believed in by the orthodox religion- ist; he is, rather, the Holy Word whose agent in the fallen world is Los, the creative spirit of man which recreates the spirit of the prophet Jesus in the life of man. A clear vision of Antichrist leads to a clear vision of Christ and to apocalypse which, in Blake, involves the trans- formation of the natural world into the spiritual world. A relevant point is that in Europe (written in 1 794) Blake makes Newton blow the trumpet which heralds the Last Judgment and the end of the natural world (Europe, Plate 13). This is representative of the fact that complete materialism must, at its extreme, will its own destruction and herald its opposite. We will see towards the end of this paper how the bodies of the longliving Ancients in Part V of Back to Methuselah form the "anal- ogy" of the immortal spiritual body and how longevity, when carried to its extreme, reveals to the Ancients that the time has come for getting rid of the limitations of the natural body. In Blakean terms, the secret of Shaw's use of the longevity myth lies in this, that longevity as the Spectre of Urthona is necessary for Los's evolutionary work in time: it must be used by Los for the redemption of mankind although it be- longs naturally to the Longlivers. The Longlivers themselves represent the apparent triumph of the Darwinian Selfhood, although in reality they constitute an "analogy" of the "eternal life" (p. 243) towards which mankind strives in Back to Methuselah. Ill In The Quintessence of Ibsenism Shaw had distinguished between the will as "Original sin" when doing mischief and as "Divine grace" when doing good (Major Critical Essays, p. 20). This distinction explains roughly the difference between Circumstantial Selection and Creative Evolution, a difference which is brought out in Back to Methuselah, and reinforced by Shaw's explanations in the Preface to the play. Explain- ing the Darwinian Evolutionist's theory that giraffes have long necks because at a critical point the short-necked ones grew weaker and died as they could not reach foliage, and the long-necked ones survived as they had food (and therefore their progeny had the strength to grow even longer necks, to reach more food), Shaw writes:</page><page sequence="11">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 151 This process, by which the species gains, say, an inch in reach, will repeat itself until the giraffe's neck is so long that he can always find food enough within his reach, at which point, of course, the selective process stops and the length of the giraffe's neck stops with it. Other- wise, he would grow until he could browse off the trees in the moon. And this, mark you, without the intervention of any stock-breeder, hu- man or divine, and without will, purpose, design or even consciousness beyond the blind will to satisfy hunger. It is true that this blind will, being in effect a will to live, gives away the whole case; but still, as compared to the open-eyed intelligent wanting and trying of Lamarck, the Darwinian process may be described as a chapter of accidents. [Pre- face, pp.xxxix- xl] The will, in Circumstantial Selection, is thus seen as attached to the natural appetites of a physical body, or as Blake would term it, the Selfhood. This attitude to the will restricts it to being the tool of man as a creature preoccupied solely and greedily, and blindly, with day-to-day survival in a world of accidents. Mental effort is reduced to uncon- scious reactions, man to a "mere automaton," and a case may be made for even "the evolution of an automatic Jesus or Shakespear" (p. xlvii). The Creative Evolutionist's belief is that "the will to do anything can and does, at a certain pitch of intensity set up by conviction of its necessity, create and organize new tissue to do it with" (p. xvi). "The old saying, 'Where there is a will, there is a way,' condenses Lamarck's theory of functional adaptation [now called Creative Evolution] into a proverb" (p. lvii). This will is the will in the control of the Blakean Divine Imagination as opposed to the Selfhood. Shaw explains the working of this in himself as a creative writer: ... I do not regard my part in the production of my books and plays as much greater than that of an amanuensis or an organ-blower. An author is an instrument in the grip of Creative Evolution [the Will of God], and may find himself starting a movement to which in his own little person [the Selfhood], he is intensely opposed, [p. 257] 14 Similarly, Blake sees his Saviour "dictating the words" of Jerusalem, and asks him to annihilate the Selfhood in him (J 5). Both Shaw and Blake consider themselves in the line of prophets inspired to reveal the Word of God. Self-control is control of the will that automatically and naturally attaches itself to Luvah as the Selfhood. The Creative Evolutionist stresses self-control as the greatest of all qualities for survival: Uncontrolled qualities may be selected for survival and development for certain periods and under certain circumstances. For instance, since it is the ungovernable gluttons who strive the hardest to get food and drink,</page><page sequence="12">152 VALLI RAO their efforts would develop their strength and cunning in 'a period of such scarcity that the utmost they could do would not enable them to overeat themselves. But a change of circumstances involving a plentiful supply of food would destroy them. . . . But the self-controlled man survives all such changes of circumstance, because he adapts himself to them, and eats neither as much as he can hold nor as little as he can scrape along on, but as much as is good for him. . . . [Self-control is] a highly developed vital sense, dominating and regulating the mere appe- tites. To overlook the very existence of this supreme sense; to miss the obvious inference that it is the quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive; to omit, in short, the highest moral claim of Evolutionary Selec- tion: all this, which the Neo-Darwinians did in the name of Natural Selection,15 shewed the most pitiable want of mastery of their own sub- ject. . . . [Preface, pp. li-liii] This concept of the will as an instrument working for the Imagina- tion and thus providing for Creative or Christian Evolution takes us to the heart of the parallel between Chapter II of Jerusalem and Part II of Back to Methuselah, "The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas," the first part of the play to be written. The identification of the Spectre of Urthona as a symbol of linear time or clocktime, and the identity of that with the will (which, in the abstract, exists in linear time but not in space) is evident in Back to Methuselah as in Jerusalem. England during the Napoleonic wars and England during World War I are both, figuratively, in the terminology of Jersualem, Albion "sick to death" (J 40). Los calls for help for the diseased Albion. Re- sponse comes from the four chief Cathedral Cities, who represent the Church of England (as Foster Damon explains in A Blake Dictionary, p. 71). They are the English version of the four Zoas (see/ 59) and contain within them the rest of the twenty-four Cathedral Cities, who correspond to the twenty-four elders around God's throne in Revela- tion. In their eternal form they are one in Jesus (/ 40), but in their earthly form they come trembling and unwilling to suffer for Albion's sake. Their counterpart in Back to Methuselah is Bill Haslam, a good- natured but totally helpless clergyman in "The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas," who has watched the 1914-18 war with the same helpless attitude in which he sits through the long conversation during which the Barnabas brothers attempt to convert the politicians to a responsi- ble religion. When the Cathedral Cities fail to help, Los, who of course has him- self been part of the four chief Cathedral Cities or Zoas, rages against them. Similarly, Franklyn Barnabas, the ex-clergyman, is critical of the Church after having been a clergyman himself. The Cathedral Cities, urged by Los's words, try forcibly to bring back Albion from Ulro (the</page><page sequence="13">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 153 Blakean hell) to Eden, against his will. They do not succeed, as "the Will must not be bended but in the day of Divine Power,"16 that day being the day when "Jesus shall appear" (J 44:18-19, 30) at his Second Coming. Meanwhile Albion's life must continue in the world of Gen- eration for Such is the nature of the Ulro, that whatever enters Becomes Sexual &amp; is Created and Vegetated and Born. [/ 44:21-22] And Los as the "Spirit of Prophecy" is appointed to watch over all in the state of Generation. Los's attempt at persuading the Cathedral Cities to force Albion against his will into Eden is a mistaken and premature move: he cannot jump clocktime (that is, ignore the Spectre of Urthona) and establish the City of God. What he must do is control the will of man imaginatively in the fallen world. The Spectre of Ur- thona, as will and clocktime, thus plays a crucial part in the scheme of redemption. Los cannot do anything constructive without him (as we have seen in Section II above); he must continually work to draw him away from the Selfhood, and insofar as Los and not the Selfhood controls the Spectre of Urthona, the latter allows for evolution in time - Creative Evolution, as Shaw calls it when he speaks of control of the will. This is what Los is shown doing in the remainder of Chapter II of Jerusalem, and it is what Shaw's prophet Franklyn Barnabas does when he preaches the necessity of willing to live longer. Franklyn and his biologist brother Conrad, in Part II of Back to Methuselah, make "their famous attempt to persuade our political leaders in the first years after the war to discard their obsolete party programs and raise the slogan of Back to Methuselah" (as Shaw summarizes it in "A Glimpse of the Domesticity of Franklyn Barnabas").17 Franklyn is an "impressive- looking gentleman of 50" with an "air of personal distinction" and of clerical dignity, Conrad has "much less style in his bearing and car- riage" (p. 37). Franklyn and Conrad attempt to make "this withered thing religion, and this dry thing science" come alive in their religion of Creative Evolution, and in this process they bear the same artist-crafts- man relationship to each other that Los and his Spectre bear when they work together at Los's forge to awaken Albion. The Spectre is Los's "own brother and other self"18 and Los's "craftsmanship,"19 and the "Reasoning Power" (/ 10) who must be subservient to the creative and imaginative power of Los if he is to work for the benefit of mankind, as he does when he helps Los to construct Golgonooza and the "Spaces of Erin" (the whole world of Generation) in Jerusalem (see J 6-12) and as Conrad works in Part II of Back to Methuselah with Franklyn-Los.</page><page sequence="14">154 VALLI RAO The Los-Spectre relationship is also echoed by Franklyn-Conrad in "A Glimpse of the Domesticity of Franklyn Barnabas" and again in the Shaw-Weismann relationship in the Preface. In the opening sentence of his introduction to "A Glimpse of the Domesticity of Franklyn Bar- nabas," Shaw clearly speaks of Franklyn as the chief exponent of the longevity theory, with his "gruff brother Conrad, the biologist" as helper. And Mrs Etteen, the husband-stealer who is interested in Franklyn's religion, tells Immenso Champernoon (G. K. Chesterton): Conrad never saw the scope of his idea [of longevity] any more than Weismann, from whom he got it. He saw how it affected science: he knew that he had to die when he was just beginning to discover what science really is, and had just found out that the experience of people who die at seventy is only a string of the mistakes of immaturity. He had the skeleton of the great faith; but it was Franklyn who put the flesh on it. [p. 258] In the Preface Shaw explains how his theory of Voluntary Longevity was based on a suggestive observation by Weismann (pp. xvi-xvii), and also how the same Weismann was capable of blind cruelty when his philosophy was dissociated from imagination (see pp. xlix- 1). How this is parallel to the unimaginative malevolence of Barnabas in Part III, and the malevolence of the Spectre when separate from Los's imagina- tive control, we will discuss later. Shaw could not have chosen a better legend than that of longevity through subconscious willing to emphasize, in the first place, the Blak- ean notion that any scheme for redemption must involve Los with the Spectre of Urthona; and, in the second place, that Creative Evolution occurs only insofar as the Spectre of Urthona is attached to Los rather than to the natural man. Lengthening life to three hundred years is symbolic of a first step in emancipation from the natural cycle of life- and-death, of growing from an infancy dependent on Mother Nature to an adulthood where Nature is man's emanation and totally con- trolled by him (this is the aim of Creative Evolution, Shaw says in the Postscript; see p. 263). Shaw does not say that because man lives longer he grows wiser. He says that the longer life must be wrested from Nature because man's mind has more potential for wisdom and he needs a longer existence in physical time and space to realize his poten- tial. Adam, with his mental capacity, was bored with the length of his life, as he had not enough intellect to occupy his time, which meant that the longer life only symbolized the power of the Spectre of Ur- thona over him, so that death was a blessing. As man's mind becomes more capable of thought, he finds that death comes too soon, and that he must extend his natural life-span. In Blakean terms, this means that</page><page sequence="15">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 155 as the power of Los grows, Enitharmon (space) and the Spectre Clock- time must be increasingly subject to him. We have seen briefly in Sec- tion II that the same Blakean notion underlies the superman myth in Man and Superman, and now we are in a position to see that the legend of longevity is an alternate form of the Creative Evolutionist's belief in the breeding of the Superman: both involve the building of Golgo- nooza by Los working with his spectre and emanation. It is also worth noting here that in Back to Methuselah Shaw does not ignore the super- man myth that a higher breed of man must be born of Woman. In the context of the entire play, Lilith is the Mother who strives to bring forth Adam, and then watches over the Adamic man's transformation, through various stages, into a Thought vortex. The woman plays her constructive part in the scheme of Longevity, as we see, for example, if we extend our quotation from "The Domesticity of Franklyn Barna- bas," where Mrs Etteen says Conrad "had the skeleton of the great faith; but it was Franklyn who put the flesh on it. And it was I, the woman, who made that flesh for him out of my own. That is my relation to Franklyn."20 Once we have grasped the importance of the role of the Spectre of Urthona in Los's scheme for redemption, the theme of longevity in Back to Methuselah does not puzzle us as it has puzzled many critics. J.L. Wisenthal is apologetic on behalf of Shaw: The principal function of the idea of longevity in the cycle, it seems to me, is not so much to say that we can and should extend our lives as to provide a basis for the related satirical point that we behave like chil- dren. [The Marriage of Contraries, pp. 196-97] Margery Morgan seems to defend the play on the ground that Shaw did not really mean the Longevity theory to be taken seriously, and that the play is a Swiftian satire against it (see The Shavian Playground, pp. 221-24). St. John Ervine is more sharply critical of matter having anything to do with spirit: Is not G.B.S., in demanding an extension of the duration of life on the ground that we do not live long enough to learn how to live sensibly, falling into the mechanistic heresy which he denounced in the neo- Darwinians? The Swiss mystic, Amiel, remarks in his Intimate Journal that "numbers make law, but goodness has nothing to do with figures." He might have said the same about length of years. [Bernard Shaw, p. 484] The reply to such criticism may be found in Blake: "Eternity is in love with the productions of time" (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Plate 7). As Fry e writes:</page><page sequence="16">156 VALLI RAO [The] merging of imagination and time is the axis on which all Blake's thought turns. . . . Blake is to be sharply distinguished, if not from all mystics, at least from that quality in mysticism which may and often does make the mystical merely the subtlest of all attempts to get along without a redeeming power in time. [Fearful Symmetry, p. 299] This quality is what Shaw in The Quintessence of Ibsenism calls the spirit- ual rationalism which reasons about "nothing" (see Major Critical Essays, p. 22). Kenneth Lawrence is kinder than Ervine, but the same feeling of the incompatibility of spirit and matter leaves him uneasy with the longev- ity theme. He tries to explain away the idea of longevity by saying Shaw (at first) began to see that there was simply not enough stretch to the fabric to make it [human material] fit. For Creative Evolution to be really creative it would need to use larger units of human life. . . . This was Shaw's preliminary notion; later, the idea of quantitative change would ultimately give way to the notion of qualitative change. Shaw's developing concept of the Life Force at first lights upon Longevity as a possible answer to its unsatisfied demands for higher forms. . . . That [the term of 300 years] is arrived at fortuitously and happens to people quite unlikely to fulfill the Life Force and its plans (Haslam and the Maid) is an index of the arbitrariness of this power, its nature as Nature. . . . Ultimately . . . Longevity fails . . . for it is deposited in a frail vessel, the human body, which remains matter for as long as it lives, be it seventy or seven hundred years. The conflict between spirit and matter is prior to the proposed solution of longevity.21 Robert Hamilton gets close to the Blakean interpretation but rejects it in a fit of rational literalism: . . . Shaw's position amounts to this - that he has sought to persuade us at great length and with great eloquence throughout the Cycle of five long plays that we need greater longevity in order to build a better world, the ultimate end of which is that the inhabitants will want to die. . . . They want to get rid of the body, that is, to die, so that they may enter into eternal Life. But this is precisely the aim of the Christian - except that he expects to die after three-score years or so instead of thousands. Shaw himself seems to recognize this in a speech he puts into the mouth of the Elderly Gentleman. . . . However, in defence of his general position, Shaw would probably answer that on the premise of Creative Evolution the Life Force can only evolve in time, and that the Ancients, through their longevity, have at last reached the stage in time in which ultimate Mind is possible. But this does not help us much. You are not going to persuade people to live longer in order that thousands or millions of years hence the Force that created them may get a Mind -</page><page sequence="17">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 157 even if you can get over the absurdity that in order to create them it must have a purpose that already presupposes a Mind.22 As should be obvious to us by now, no conscious preoccupation on the part of the Selfhood with longevity can enable a man to live longer. Shaw writes in his blurb for the Penguin edition of Back to Methuselah: ... he [Shaw] pointed out . . . that if men become convinced in their subconsciousness that a longer life time is necessary to the survival of the race they will live longer. Thereupon people - again those who had not read this book - -jumped to the conclusion that by willing greedily enough to live for ever they could perhaps do so. They would probably be the first to perish. In Shaw's illustrative cycle of plays no one of the persons who find themselves, very embarassingly, in the prime of life at ninety has had the least conscious foreknowledge of what was happening to them.23 Shaw is making sure that he has locked the gate on his legend of longevity, so that Don Quixote cannot take a literal stroll in it and harm himself. The play makes the point emphatically. Bürge and Lubin want to know the "secret" elixir of longevity - sour milk, lemons, powder, bottle, tabloid? (pp. 72, 81). Savvy secretly wishes it would happen to her and is jealous when Conrad says it might happen to the parlormaid (pp. 82, 86). But it happens to none of the hopefuls. (In Act III, we learn that Lubin, in fact, is shot because he forms the conviction that he is going to live 300 years and "began to tell people the truth.") Frank- lyn and Conrad themselves can neither wish themselves into being one of the Elect nor prophesy to whom it might happen (p. 82). Their out-of-proportion dismay at the unexpected intrusion of Haslam (and the parlormaid) at the crucial juncture when they are discussing that the length of human life should be 300 years is, retrospectively viewed, comment on their shock at the unexpected choice of the Life Force. The Life Force can use the most commonplace people for its purpose and transfigure them into nobility. Shaw's idea in "The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas" is, as he ex- plained, "to exhibit the Church, marriage, the family, and parliament under shorthand conditions before reproducing them [in the later acts] under long-lived conditions."24 The institutions, and their products, are shown to be ignorantly evil and inefficient, and Franklyn Barnabas explains that this is because "Life is too short for men to take it seri- ously" and organize themselves in a more responsible manner. The result, again in Franklyn's words, is "A world without conscience: that is the horror of our condition." He explores this world of 1920 espe- cially in his conversation with the politicians, and the parallel is there</page><page sequence="18">158 VALLI RAO with Los-Blake's exploration of war-ridden England a century before. Los searches the interiors of Albion's bosom, entering the caves of despair and death to find the oppressors of Albion, the tempters and the Accusers, and to persuade them against vengeance and towards a fair peace with France (J 31). He watches the "collapse of man's hope in the nightmare of history," as Harold Bloom comments (The Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. Erdman; p. 854). War breaks out "in rivers of blood over Europe" and Los hears the mingling cries of the Victim and his Punisher, "enslaved and tormented to him whom he has murder'd, bound in vengeance &amp; enmity." The poet's hand records the tragedy: Shudder not, but Write, &amp; the hand of God will assist you! Therefore I write Albion's last words: "Hope is banish'd from me." L/47] The merciful Saviour receives Albion in his arms of tender mercy and reposes him on the Rock of Ages (J 48). The Divine Lord builds a Couch of repose, with sixteen pillars, the inspired books of the Bible, and as Wicksteed observes, "though the Scripture story of Man's long history be little better than a 'Tomb' unless 'Spiritually discerned,' it is a Tomb that preserves the bones that the living mind can restore to life."23 Los also tells the sick Albion of the Limits of Opacity (Satan) and Contraction (Adam), and that there is no Limit of Translucence (J 42). Franklyn says that the war went England's way, but the peace went its own way; the statesmen of Europe proved incapable of governing, and they will all helplessly watch another war soon. Present civilization is failing, says Conrad, and Franklyn adds that they are relapsing into barbarism (pp. 70-71). Hope lies in the Bible, the "most scientific document we possess at present" (p. 73), understood not in a funda- mentalist sense as Bürge interprets it (p. 77) but as "inspired human language." Franklyn explains the war in terms of man's fall as he "came crashing down all the steps of this Jacob's ladder that reached from paradise to a hell on earth" (pp. 75-76). He tells Lubin and Bürge of the Life Force's limitless potential for achievement: "As there is no limit to power and knowledge there can be no end" (p. 74; see also Preface, p. liv, for Shaw's similar view of the powers of the Life Force). This is the Blakean notion that "there is no Limit of Expansion; there is no Limit of Translucence" (J 42). Franklyn explains the Limits of Opacity and Contraction: Adam and Eve were hung up between two frightful possibilities. One was the extinction of mankind by their accidental death [Albion's fall into the abyss of Non-Entity or total material chaos]. The other was the prospect of living for ever [in unending or indefinite time, that is, in the power of the Spectre of Urthona]. They could bear neither. They de-</page><page sequence="19">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 159 cided that they would just take a short turn of a thousand years, and meanwhile hand on their work to a new pair. Consequently, they had to invent natural birth and natural death [the Blakean Limits of Contrac- tion and Opacity], which are, after all, only modes of perpetuating life without putting on any single creature the terrible burden of immortal- ity ... the moment [Adam] invented death . . . the [Garden of Eden] was no longer worth the trouble. It was then that he let the thistles grow. Life was so short that it was no longer worth his while to do anything thoroughly well. [pp. 73-75] IV Part I of Back to Methuselah elaborates on Shaw-Franklyn's version of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Act I of Part I shows that, unlike the Miltonic version, and like the Blakean one, man has lost the divine vision before the first chapter of Genesis.26 Shaw's garden of Eden is Blake's fallen Beulah, where indefinite time and endless space (the "analogy" of Edenic eternity and infinity) torment a poor Adam shut in the "narrow doleful form" of the physical body (J 49:32). In such a state, The Visions of Eternity, by reason of narrowed perceptions, Are become weak Visions of Time &amp; Space, fix'd into furrows of death. 'J 49:21-22] Shaw's Adam and Eve discover accidental death in a fawn, and are instinctively repelled by the body of Death. They know that, logically, they will cease to be, sooner or later. They also know that this must not happen: a voice inside them puts that thought into their heads. Adam despairs at the thought of Death leading to Non-Entity, but at the same time he broods over the horror of personal immortality as the individ- ual Adam he is at present. He wants to be born again and better. Eve, the female principle in the human psyche, does not think about herself ("what is the use? I am what I am: nothing can alter that") but about the material well-being of Adam. And before the end of the first scene she discovers the secret of genital sexuality and reproduction which will enable man to survive as a race even if he dies as an individual. The Serpent in "In the Beginning," who shows Eve the way to the sexual world of Generation from Beulah, is representative of Nature herself.27 Her "glowing" new colors and "magnificent amethystine hood" (p. 6) are a symbol of material life and wealth. The coils of her body, twining "in apparently endless rings through the branches of a tree" (p. 3) symbolize the continual Ore cycles of natural life bound to vegetation, like Blake's serpent temple which is an "image of infinite shut up in finite revolutions" (Europe, Plate 10). The tree itself is that of</page><page sequence="20">160 VALLI RAO the Knowledge of Good and Evil, a symbol of the vegetable world and, as Frye explains, of the tree of Mystery on which Jesus as Ore is crucified.28 Shaw's Serpent is, like Blake's, the form of mysterious nature (note Shaw's description of her voice as "a strange seductively musical whisper"). She is the Female Will who can be Tirzah (when restricting the senses of man) as well as Enitharmon (when working with Los), her ambivalent role being perhaps defined by her "double tongue" (p. 6). She seems a version of Lilith, the archetypal Female Will in Back to Methuselah about whom she tells Eve many things: Lilith existed before Adam and Eve, and was alone, there was no man with her; she saw accidental death and was impelled to renew herself; she strove and willed unbearably to produce Eve and Adam, because the burden of creating, she discovered, was too much for one; still, she made sure that Adam should be in Eve's power through his desire; Lilith renewed life through the power of her desire, imagination, will, and creativity: in a word, her power of conception; she took care to keep the power of creation from Adam, because "if he could do that [create his own kind] he could do without Eve." She may be viewed as Vala who causes Albion's original fall into passivity and who subsequently, Pandora-like, brings both hope and disaster to the fallen Albion.29 On the whole, Shaw shows the Serpent, like Lilith in her single per- sonal appearance at the end of Back to Methuselah, as benevolent Nature.30 As the earth mother, Lilith is closer to Blake's benevolent, protective emanations such as Los's Enitharmon, Enion, Eno and Erin, than to Tirzah and Rahab.31 Shaw shows that his Lilith and Serpent are not restrictive and jealous Tirzah-figures who try to keep man under their dominion for ever. They point the way to man to a higher life which they themselves cannot achieve, and long for man's achieving it. Lilith has looked after and protected men for many ages because she wants them to reach out towards "the whirlpool in pure intelligence . . . though I know well that when they attain it they shall become one with me and supercede me, and Lilith will be only a legend and a lay that has lost its meaning" (pp. 253-54). The wise and intelligent serpent who has discovered the method of reproduction which enables snakes to survive as a species, wants the relatively childish and unintelligent Eve to learn it too, because she wants man, as a higher species than snake, to survive: "I must have something to worship. Something quite different to myself, like you. There must be something greater than the snake." Insofar as the Serpent works to build Generation as a constructive thing she is Los's helpmate Enitharmon as he builds Erin's Spaces and Golgonooza in Chapter I oí Jerusalem. Los of course cannot build them</page><page sequence="21">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 161 without his emanation's help anymore than he can without his spectre's: he must work in space as well as in time to achieve practical efficiency, as we have seen. Los sees that . . . the Religion of Generation, which was meant for the destruction Of Jerusalem, [must] become her covering till the time of the End. O holy Generation, Image of regeneration! O point of mutual forgiveness between Enemies! Birthplace of the Lamb of God incomprehensible! t/7] So he creates the "Spaces of Erin" (Lilith's world, in terms of Back to Methuselah) in his Furnaces, and "the Spaces of Erin reach'd from the starry heighth to the starry depth."32 He gives Vala, the vege- table shadow of Jerusalem, a Body, even though she is essentially evil: God will work through Generation (J 12). He builds the city of Golgonooza in the midst of the fallen world (J 12, 13) and he gives his Sons and Daughters a vegetable existence (J 14). The Serpent's invention of the art of Words in Back to Methuselah is also under the direction of Los: Los built the stubborn structure of the [English] Language, acting against Albion's melancholy, who must else have been a Dumb despair. 'J 40] In both Shaw and Blake, the entry into Generation, on the one hand a redemptive scheme of mercy, is on the other hand a step in the Fall. Shaw's Adam drops further into passivity and procrastination, and de- cides to clear the garden of thistles "tomorrow." Life is more compli- cated than in Beulah: he and Eve experience the passions of jealousy, murder, fear, kinship, love, anger. Adam broods on the uncertain fu- ture, breeding the new misery of fear. The remedy, says the Serpent, is Hope. But while Eve is willing to be a "builder in hope" as the builder in Golgonooza is (J 12:43), Adam must have certainty, for fear is stronger in him than hope: "Hope is wicked. Happiness is wicked. Certainty is blessed. . . . Whatever I fear to do is wicked." He binds the future with his resolve to have certainty, by deciding that he will live a thousand years, and that he and Eve will be married to each other all that time. He then leaves, because he is afraid to listen to the secret, which the Serpent whispers to Eve (the secret being how to make Adam "give his desire and his will" to Eve). Shaw describes her reaction: "Eve's face lights up with intense interest, which increases until an expression of overwhelming repugnance takes its place. She buries her face in her hands." For, in the words of Jerusalem, the "places of joy &amp; love [are] excrementitious" (J 88).</page><page sequence="22">162 VALLI RAO V Albion's Spectre from his Loins Tore forth in all the pomp of War: Satan his name: in flames of fire He stretch'd his Druid Pillars [of human sacrifice] far. Jerusalem 27:37-40 The second act of Part I of Back to Methuselah, set in Mesopotamia a few centuries after Adam's decision to enter Generation, introduces us to his eldest son, Cain, the first murderer. Cain corresponds to the eldest son of Albion, Hand, in Jerusalem. Hand is the Spectre of Albion (J 36:23) who is "the Great Selfhood, Satan, Worship'd as God by the Mighty Ones of the Earth" (J 33; see also/ 90:40-43 for Hand and the other Spectral Sons as the Selfhood and Satan).33 He organizes war, the crucifying impulse (as Los shows his Spectre in J 8, 9). He is pictured on Plate 26 as a "marching crucifix" (Erdman's description in The Illu- minated Blake) in flames; and on Plate 50 as the Selfhood, the three- headed monster described in Plate 70 as the "Three Forms named Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke," and containing within him Rahab who "Sat, deep within him hid, his Feminine Power unreveal'd." As we noted in Section II, the ultimate form of the Selfhood is the Covering Cherub or Antichrist, a "Warlike Mighty-one" with the harlot Rahab inside him (J 89). Cain revolts against the clay and the natural life which content his father. He wants to be something better than a mere digger: for him, there is no joy like fighting, and "he who has never fought has never lived." But he cannot be on a higher plane of evolution than Adam because he, like Hand, knows how to fight only with the physical sword and not with Los's "spiritual sword" (J 9) which builds Golgonooza and Jerusalem. Hand (and Cain) as the warrior who fights the physical fight, and the prophet inspired by the Holy Word (and the Shavian Life Force) who fights the "Mental Fight," together with the Blakean (and Shavian) Adam who stands between the other two, represent the "Three Classes" of men Blake adapts from the Miltonic concept of the Elect, the Reprobate and the Redeemed. It is worth defining these terms in some detail here, as they help to understand Cain's relation- ship with Adam as well as, later on, the character of the Elderly Gentle- man in Part IV of Back to Methuselah. In Blake, the Elect is "the Reasoning Negative" (Milton 5:14), a nega- tion of moral virtue, but with no positive qualities of its own (Frye explains this point in Fearful Symmetry, pp. 197-98). Representatives of the Elect class, among whom are Satan in Milton and Hand in Jerusalem</page><page sequence="23">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 163 (and Cain in Back to Methuselah), have no existence in Eternity, they are Negations who disappear at the apocalypse. They "cannot Believe in Eternal Life/Except by Miracle &amp; a New Birth" (Milton 25). The Repro- bate, represented by Rintrah in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and in Milton, "never cease to Believe [in Eternal Life]." Theirs is the pro- phetic spirit which is called reprobate by orthodox religionists. The Redeemed class of men, to whom Adam belongs, "live in doubts &amp; fears perpetually tormented by the Elect" (Milton 25). They are re- deemed from that situation by the Reprobate, who is the true Contrary of the Redeemed while the Elect is only his Negation. As Frye explains, the Adamic man has the elements of the prophetic spirit in him, but it is mixed with fear which leads him to use those elements in passively conforming to social and religious ills (Fearful Symmetry, pp. 189, 198). The job of the Reprobate prophet is to separate the elements of the prophetic spirit and the elements of cowardly subservience in the Re- deemed - then the Adamic man is redeemed as part of the Reprobate, and his errors are seen for what they are (part of the Negation) and cast out. The Negation, as Los says, can be organized only "as a distorted &amp; reversed Reflexion [of the truth in Eden] in the Darkness/And in the Non Entity" (J 17) and, when revealed as the Covering Cherub, his "Brain incloses a reflexion/Of Eden all perverted" (J 89). Cain's idea of war is a hellish parody of the Edenic war of Ideas. He wants his mother Eve to create more children so that he can fulfil the "glorious poem" he has imagined: I will divide them into two great hosts [he means not heavenly but earthly armies]. One of them I will lead; and the other will be led by the man I fear most and desire to fight and kill most. And each host shall try to kill the other host. Think of that! all those multitudes of men fighting, fighting, killing, killing! The four rivers running with blood! [The four are the four Zoas (J 98) but reflected perversely in the Covering Cherub (J 89).] The shouts of triumph! the howls of rage! the curses of despair! the shrieks of torment! That will be life indeed: life lived to the very marrow: burning, overwhelming life. [p. 21] Cain proudly boasts that while Adam is a mere convenience for Eve, digging and sweating for her like any beast of burden, he is a mighty warrior who is the "master of Woman, not her baby and her drudge." Eve angrily counters him, pointing out that in reality he is much more the slave of his wife Lua than Adam is hers. The detailed description of Lua's enslaving of Cain that Eve launches on (pp. 22-23) establishes Lua as Rahab hidden behind the Covering Cherub's warlike exterior.34 The State Rahab is the "System of Moral Virtue" (J 39:10) and Cain is steeped in that system. He justifies his brand as God's sign of appro-</page><page sequence="24">164 VALLI RAO val and protection; speaks of his Voice as the Voice of God, and Lilith's and Adam's Voice as that of the Devil; quotes Tennyson in saying that "[his] strength [in fighting] is as the strength of ten because [his] heart is pure," turned "upward to the sun, to the clear clean heavens." Cain is a Darwinian believer in the survival of the fittest, and "the Selfish Center" (J 71:7) which mocks the Christian belief that we are members of one another. As he tells Adam: ... I am not a child to be afraid of a Voice. The Voice thought I was nothing but my brother's keeper. It found that I was myself, and that it was for Abel to be himself also, and look to himself. He was not my keeper any more than I was his: why did he not kill me? There was no more to prevent him than there was to prevent me: it was man to man; and I won. I was the first conqueror, [p. 25] The connection between Darwinism and war that Shaw emphasizes in the Preface is made clear here too, and perhaps explains why the warrior Napoleon's full name (in Part IV) is Cain Adamson Charles Napoleon. Eve sees that through Cain and his like, "death is gaining on life." The diggers and the fighters both fall short of her dream of another, divine, life. Her hope rests in the Reprobate prophetic spirit of Los, in those children who have the potential to be creative artists: poets, sculptors, musicians, mathematicians, astronomers, and prophets, who are likeable despite their many faults. In them is Eve's hope that one day man will evolve beyond material to spiritual wholeness, and live long enough to eat manna, food drawn from heaven: Man need not always live by bread alone. There is something else. We do not yet know what it is; but some day we shall find out; and then we will live on that alone; and there shall be no more digging nor spinning, nor fighting nor killing, [p. 33] VI [The Deist] is in the State named Rahab. . . .

One must die at the usual time." Haslam has, during the 283 years he has lived so far, served his country under the names and in the capacities of Archbishop Haslam, Archbishop Stickit,33 President Dickenson, General Bullyboy, and is Archbishop of York when the discovery of his longevity is made. The Parlormaid has risen to become the Domestic Minister of the Islands, and is called Mrs Lutestring. Both are in the prime of life; he has "complete authority and self-possession," she is "grave, swift, decisive, awful, unanswerable" and has "the walk of a goddess"; and President Burge-Lubin as well as Confucius are a little afraid of their presence. In Blakean terms, they represent the initial strength and purity of a newly arisen Orc-Urizen cycle, before it starts degenerating.30 In the context of "The Thing Happens," the Blakean concept of Deism is represented by Barnabas, who is "rather like Conrad Barnabas" ("a descendant of the great Conrad Barnabas," Burge-Lubin informs us, on p. 125) but curt, harsh, querulous and malevolent. He is like Con- rad without Franklyn, Weismann as a Neo-Darwinian, Los's Spectre out of Los's control. Barnabas has estimated that the average duration of human life is seventy-eight, and is horrified at any suggestion that his Act may have to be amended. He considers the Archbishop's and Mrs Lutestring's living so long an "unnatural horror" and, raving with a hatred towards them akin to de Stogumber's against Joan,37 he says he is "going to raise the country against this horror" (p. 125). He wants them put to death or at least sterilized so as to make ineffectual their proposed marriage: "They will do it in cold blood because their chil- dren will live three hundred years. It mustnt be allowed" (p. 123). He wants them killed because it is his instinct to kill them: "What reason can you give for killing a snake? Nature tells you to do it" (p. 125). The difference of course is that whereas the snake is a lower species than man, the Longlivers belong to a higher order of man than those men who die naturally at seventy-eight or so: their living longer symbolizes their power over nature and their ability to overcome her natural laws. This power enables Mrs Lutestring, when Barnabas tries to bar her way out of the room, to walk "straight at the Accountant General, who instinctively shrinks out of the way as she leaves the room" (p. 124). He is left raging, but helpless, unlike the murderers of Jesus and Joan who have the power to kill their victims. The Archbishop and Mrs Lutestring may be viewed as versions of the Christ figure, superior to their fellowmen who consider them unnat- ural law-breakers, and yet powerful enough to resist any official death sentence or torture. A contrasting Christ figure is the Elderly Gentle- man in Part IV who, to be more precise, is a Christ-as-Job figure,</page><page sequence="26">166 VALLI RAO where both Jesus and Job depict in their lives the story of Israel-Jacob's existence as Luvah or the natural, Adamic, man. The death of the Elderly Gentleman is an example of the death of Luvah, a victim of natural circumstances as Job and the historical Jesus were.38 In Baghdad, the capital of the British Commonwealth in A.D. 3000, the Elderly Gentleman has lived as perfectly upright and respectably prosperous a life as Job in the Land of Uz.39 He has come to visit the land of the Longlivers, along with other Shortlivers such as the Prime Minister of the British Middle East, Mr Badger Bluebin (referred to as 'The Envoy' throughout Part IV), who intends to consult the Oracle in that land as his predecessor did fifteen years before. The Longlivers bear the relation of gods to the Shortlivers (as Wisenthal points out in The Marriage of Contraries, p. 212) and the Elderly Gentleman's experi- ence in their land is akin to Job's experience once his god has entered the scene (Illustration II onwards in Blake's Job). The Elderly Gentleman, as Adamic man, belongs to the Blakean Redeemed class, the redeemed or saved part of whom joins the Repro- bate, and the unredeemed part of whom is revealed, with the Elect, as error or Negation. This is clearly shown in the Elderly Gentleman: at his best he is superior to anything else in Part IV, the isolated Repro- bate figure crying in the wilderness of lost souls;40 at his worst his identity is one with the Envoy, who glosses facts to deceive himself and others.41 It is appropriate that both the Elderly Gentleman and the Envoy are descended from Burge-Lubin (the Redeemed Adam of Part III, and himself descended from Bürge and Lubin of Part II) since they are a splitting of the Adamic state into redeemed and unre- deemed. The Envoy, at the end of the Part, returns to his country to continue the unredeemed Adamic life; the Elderly Gentleman gives meaning to his life, even in death, as Bernard F. Dukore points out.42 In examining the experience that the Elderly Gentleman goes through, it is important to bear in mind that he, like Job, is an individ- ual as well as the whole body of humanity; and what Frye writes of Job is equally true of the Elderly Gentleman: [The] ambiguity between Job as individual and Job as social being or patriarch is of a kind central to all mythical structures of this descent- and-return shape [of the community of man]. . . . The general critical principle involved here is that in a descent-and-return mythical structure the individual descends; the community returns. Temptation, alienation, despair, decisive choice, death itself, are ordeals that only the individuals can carry to their limit. But only a re-created society, like the one that crystallizes in the final scene of a comedy around a hero's marriage, can fully experience the sense of a brave new world. . . . Job's renewed state is not a subjective one. This ambiguity of "human body," which may be</page><page sequence="27">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 167 an individual or a society, is involved in the contrast between the natural body which dies and the spiritual body which rises again. ["Blake's Read- ing of the Book of Job," pp. 230-31] In the "Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman" the tragedy is of the individ- ual who faces up to the ordeals of alienation from the other Shortlivers as well as from the Longlivers, despair at the realization of the enor- mous gap between Shortlivers and Longlivers, and the decisive choice to stay among the Longlivers, even at the cost of death, rather than return to the Shortlivers' world of unreality and lies. But the destiny of the Elderly Gentleman as a representative of the Adamic race is not tragic. His noblest qualities are the ones that will be resurrected in the spiritual existence the Ancients reach out for. The positive inspiration for man's evolution from the physical to the spiritual is the Elderly Gentleman's faith in the divine spark and the Holy Ghost, not the rational and agnostic attitude which the Longlivers have cultivated by A.D. 3000. We must constantly remember that the Longlivers are far from being the last word in evolution. The connecting role they play between the Elderly Gentleman and the Ancients is similar to the role of the Over- lords in Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End, as they play gods to the earth's inhabitants until the time is mature for the latter to evolve into the Overmind. The Longlivers are no more and no less powerful than the Overlords and both, like Undershaft in Major Barbara, represent the Blakean Satan who stands for the ultimate in material civilization and who, when given complete form, is the "analogy" of Christ, and mirrors man's way to spiritual regeneration. The world of Childhood's End in its "Golden Age" ruled by the Overlords is free from "igno- rance, disease, poverty and fear"43 in the same way as are the land of the Longlivers in Back to Methuselah and the town of Perivale St. An- drews in Major Barbara. All three represent material utopias, essential up to a certain stage of evolution, at which point their inhabitants have to look beyond them for salvation. The Overlords are caught in a "biological dead-end," as Daniel J. Leary describes it, beyond which men must aspire.44 In Back to Methuselah, longevity itself can lead only to a metabiological dead-end, as the Ancients find. And in Major Bar- bara, Undershaft's town of well-nourished bodies can be saved only with the help of Barbara's spiritual strength. Neither Shaw in Back to Methuselah (and Major Barbara) nor Clarke in Childhood's End views the figure of Satan with any of the fear with which it is traditionally viewed. Clarke's Overlords are, however, di- vested of all evil, whereas Shaw presents the admirable as well as the sinister side of his Longlivers. They are models of the ideal in many</page><page sequence="28">168 VALLI RAO ways, as Dukore notes in Bernard Shaw, Playwright (pp. 253-54). They do not waste time in sentimental trivia, they are practical in their ap- proach to problems, they are growing out of the habit of substituting metaphor and image for reality, they are frank and face truth bravely, they have no conception of money or private property, they have no possessive mother-figure in their society, they are orderly and know how to conduct affairs of government efficiently, and warriors such as Napoleon are no heroes to them. They are also models of the false anthropomorphic gods that men worship, and their attitude to the Shortlivers can be one of intolerant bullying and deliberate mystifica- tion. Zozim, for instance, reduces the Elderly Gentleman to a state of discouragement and humiliation where he cries out in echo of the humble psalmist praying to his God (see Psalms 39.4,5): "Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long; and mine age is as nothing in respect of thee" (p. 186). Again, the Longlivers pretend that they have outgrown the use of images and metaphors in speech. Yet Shaw betrays them by showing them using much figurative language, including images they pretend not to understand when the Shortlivers use them. The 170-year-old Woman, Fusima, implies clearly that she does not understand non- literal images used by the Elderly Gentleman. Yet in her conversation with him she herself uses figurative expressions, as when she says she is "in the dark" (p. 136) about his usage of language. She reduces him to tears by taking literally his expression "the remedy is in your own hands" (p. 137); and yet the metaphor must still exist among the Long- livers, as we see when Zozim tells Zoo, "Bless you for taking [the El- derly Gentleman] off my hands!" (p. 144). Both Fusima and Zozim pretend not to understand the word "decent" (pp. 137, 143); but Zozim himself uses the word "delicate" (on p. 143) to mean exactly what the Elderly Gentleman's usage of "decent" conveys. The word "decent" in fact survives into A.D. 31,920 (see p. 209). Zoo mocks the Elderly Gentleman's sensible, even if full-of-metaphor, speech on civilization, by "laughing heartily at him" (p. 157). She mis- construes all he says by interpreting it literally, abuses him as "you little ephemeral thing," interrupts him offhandedly again, reduces him to exhaustion and defeat, and then brutally insists on beginning yet another argument, though he would rather be silent. She, in fact, uses her superior power to behave as Job's god behaves in Shaw's The Black Girl, when he calls the Black Girl "you ridiculous little insect" and wants to compel her to stay and "argue" with him for the sake of his enter- tainment {The Black Girl, pp. 25-26). The Longlivers use their "Vril" or power of Awe to keep the Shortlivers- Yahoos in subjection, as Shaw explains in Everybody's Politi-</page><page sequence="29">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 169 cal What's What? (pp. 285-87). The "artificial awe" created by the Oracle scene, and by the imposing Druidic robe Zozim wears as well as the robe of purple Zoo wears, are all part of the Longlivers' at- tempts to impress the Shortlivers and keep them in subjection even while they themselves are intensely aware of and contemptuous of the "mummery" and farce involved in the whole ritual. That "You must rule ignoramuses according to their ignorance" (to borrow Shaw's phrase in What I Really Wrote about the War, p. 104) does not make the Longlivers any less responsible for their mummery, which is as openly irreligious as Undershaft's provision for Shinto and Jain temples, Sal- vation barracks, and a Labor Church in Piety Square in his Antichris- tian town (see Major Barbara, film version, pp. 136-41). The Oracle herself is dressed to look mysterious and awesome. She is draped and hooded in voluminous folds of a single piece of grey-white stuff. Something supernatural about her terrifies the beholders, who throw themselves on their faces. Her outline flows and waves: she is almost distinct at moments, and again vague and shadowy: above all, she is larger than life-size, not enough to be measured by the flustered congregation, but enough to affect them with a dreadful sense of her supernaturalness. [p. 188] She is, in this perspective, no other than Blake's mysterious Rahab, the Shadowy Female who dominates Adamic man. We note that she is also called the pythoness (p. 187), and as such is the natural Female Will, and the malevolent counterpart of the Serpent, in Part I, who is be- nevolent Nature. Her killing of the Elderly Gentleman is the equivalent of the killing of Jesus-Luvah by Natural Morality and the Female Will, detailed in Chapter III of Jerusalem (Plates 63-67).

Let every Christian, as much as in him lies, engage</page><page sequence="30">170 VALLI RAO himself openly 8c publicly before all the World in some Mental pursuit for the Building up of Jerusalem. [Jerusalem 77] Shaw's Ancients in Part V of Back to Methuselah, seeking the improve- ment of things spiritual, intellectual and mental, and the power to annihilate the natural body, are the Blakean Christians of "As Far as Thought can Reach." Men by A.D. 31,920 have conquered Nature in many ways, as we learn during the course of this part of the play, and are reaching out towards the final conquest which will enable the trans- figuration of the naturally limited body into the spiritually expanded body. We have already seen how the Newly Born is from birth much more independent of the Mother. She will quickly grow into the rhythm of art and sport and sexual and dancing pleasures that the youngsters, such as those we see at the beginning of the act, enjoy. Their childhood of four years (corresponding to the years twenty to seventy as we know them today) is spent in this Beulah of beauty and harmony. As they grow out of childhood, they grow closer to Blake's Eden, rather than to Generation, our adult world of Experience. In the growing-up of Chloe, the four-year-old maiden, we see how the young- sters outgrow the passions that Adam in Part I had latent in him and that intensified when he accepted the world of Generation as the stage next to Beulah. Their sign of maturity is that they grow tired of their childish life of the senses, especially with regard to sexual love, as we see in Chloe's responses to her erstwhile lover Strephon. They begin to understand what Jerusalem tells Vala: . . . Humanity is far above Sexual organization &amp; the Visions of the Night of Beulah Where Sexes wander in dreams of bliss among the Emanations, Where the Masculine 8c Feminine are nurs'd into Youth 8c Maiden By the tears 8c smiles of Beulah's Daughters till the time of Sleep is past. L/ 79] The youngsters outgrow sleep ("Sleep is a shameful thing: I have not slept at all for weeks past," says Chloe) as they outgrow their pretty Grecian dresses and passions such as jealousy and possessiveness in love. They wander all night, fulfilling their awakening passion for thought: "thinking, thinking, thinking; grasping the world; taking it to pieces; building it up again; devising methods; planning experi- ments to test the methods; and having a glorious time" (p. 204). They also outgrow, Chloe explains, their passions for dance, music, archi- tectural beauty, words and poetry, which have so far satisfied their artistic sense but which fail to satisfy their adult passion for a more sophisticated and direct "rhythm of life" as the He-Ancient calls it (p. 200).</page><page sequence="31">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 171 This growing out of art as man matures out of Nature is the theme of the remainder of Part V. It may be understood in terms of Blake's account in Jerusalem Chapter IV, of Golgonooza and Los giving way before the City of God and the spiritually awakened Albion. Let us examine in some detail this climactic point in the Blakean and Shavian vision of Christian Evolution, starting with the entrance in Part V of the sculptors Martellus and Arjillax, together with Ecrasia, a nymph with an "authoritative bearing" and "beauty and imposing tone." Ecra- sia, who figures prominently through Part V as the champion of Fine Art, and beauty in Nature, is the Shavian parallel in this part of the independent Female Will in Jerusalem Chapter IV, who tries to keep man in the power of Nature as mankind's goal of redemption from flesh to spirit comes nearer: sometimes seen as the independent Eni- tharmon (J 87, 88, 91, 93), sometimes as the Daughters of Albion seen individually (such as Gwendolen and Cambei in/ 80), and sometimes as the Daughters united as One in Rahab (/ 84, 85). Arjillax has till now held Ecrasia in high esteem, and regarded favorably her view that the business of the artist is to create beauty. He has even, as she reminds him, "modelled me as the genius of art presiding over the infancy of your master here, Martellus" (p. 215). But now he is bored with sculp- ting "ideally beautiful nymphs and youths" (as Ecrasia calls them; Arjil- lax calls them "smirking nymphs and posturing youths") and has taken to making "horribly realistic studies" of Ancients, as Ecrasia accusingly tells the other youths and maidens. Arjillax is growing up, and growing out of worship of her, and she is angry and critical. He will not be brought to her feet again, however, in spite of scornful or persuasive arguments. He tells the story of the supernatural being called the Arch- angel Michael, a mighty sculptor and painter who graduated from painting on the ceiling of a temple the newly born in all their childish beauty, to painting a company of ancients, in those days called proph- ets and sybils. This tale, he says, is not to be believed literally but as a legend. He slaps his chest and points to the Temple of Love (where he is going to exhibit his sculptures) and says he is the man and that temple is the place. Martellus, who is older than Arjillax, has grown one stage further. He, too, made busts of Ancients, but destroyed them because he could not "give them life." He then collaborated with another youth, a scien- tist named Pygmalion, to create a pair of artificial human beings. Martellus modelled the living dolls, in whom Pygmalion succeeded in fixing "high-potential Life Force," the highest he could achieve in the laboratory. The result is a male automaton, Ozymandias, and a female automaton, Cleopatra. Martellus remarks, before they are exhibited onstage, that these "two most wonderful works of art in the world"</page><page sequence="32">172 VALLI RAO will "inspire a loathing that will cure you of the lunacy of art for ever" (p. 220). The automata are vain, susceptible to flattery, and, since they are composed of reflexes, they can do nothing original. In true Darwinian spirit they proclaim the predetermined, inevitable, unalterable, logical nature of the Universe and of their own nature and actions. The youths and maidens are indeed, as Martellus had foretold, filled with shame and loathing as they watch the automata behave with no self- control: they go through the reflexes of telling lies, boasting, cringing in fear, and selfishly wanting each other killed, before the Ancients instill some fellow-feeling into them. Ultimately they die, discouraged of life. The She-Ancient gives instructions that the two "abominations" are to be burnt, and then she and the He- Ancient take the opportunity to lecture to the youngsters on the limitations of "dolls," as they call works of art and images, among which they include the physical body. The exhibition of Martellus' "prehistoric" creatures as automata be- comes significant when their automatic nature is taken by the Ancients as an example of the automatic nature of all bodies, including their own in A.D. 31,920. We have seen in our earlier discussion of Los and his Spectre that one of Los's tasks in Golgonooza is "Giving a body to Falsehood that it may be cast off for ever,/With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his own bow" (J 12). Martellus as artist is the Los figure (like Franklyn Barnabas) who, working with Pygmalion as the Spectre of Urthona (Pygmalion is of course the Part V version of the scientist Conrad Barnabas) has done precisely this. And in the larger context of the play, Shaw as artist has worked with Weismann's theory of longev- ity up to the point where men are capable of seeing the natural body as "mere machinery" and of discarding its limiting dominion for the larger life of the soul. In terms oí Jerusalem, this is the point where Albion awakes and is capable of annihilating the Covering Cherub and living eternally in the Body of Jesus. Along with the annihilation of the natural body and the natural world, Los and Golgonooza also must vanish: for they are the redeeming power of creativity and art within nature and when their task of redeeming man from nature is achieved, they are, simultaneous with the nature of which they are a part, annihi- lated as separate entities outside Man. This crucial point about Los and Golgonooza has been explained clearly by Thomas R. Frosch and Jer- ome J. McGann. McGann explains how Los himself goes to Eternal Death along with all his invented worlds, in order to advance the redemption of Albion. When the risen Albion says to Jesus, the Divine Vision: "I see thee in the likeness &amp; similitude</page><page sequence="33">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 173 of Los my Friend" (J 96:22), we understand that art itself has finally been redeemed to the Divine Vision. This entails the annihilation of "art" for "Vision". . . . Golgonooza, Los's city, is not Jerusalem but the means toward it, and the function of his city of art is to reveal the whorish aspects of all creation. Golgonooza too must go to Eternal Death, for it stands not only as the promise of Jerusalem, but also as the last great temptation to retreat from vision. Golgonooza is the house whose windows of the morning open out to the worlds of eter- nity, where Jesus dwells. We were never meant to live in it, or with it, but through it.45 Frosch explains how Golgonooza is "fallen art, built in nature . . . [and] is potentially the point of entry to a new world" but does not in itself contain Jerusalem (he quotes/ 12:43-44 in support), nor is it identical with Eden (J 12:52). In Blake, the goal of art is the moment at which it becomes unnecessary, because the whole of life has taken on the character of art. ... It is the job of the fallen artist to reorganize the natural body, to awaken it to its self-induced limitations and its real potentialities, until it regains the capacity to arise and enter Eden by itself. In this transformation, what we now recognize as art disappears: when Albion enters the furnaces, Los drops out of the poem, consumed with all else in his Sublime Uni- verse. [The Awakening of Albion, p. 159] The Ancients, coming close to Eden, find that art, like nature, does not satisfy them any longer: neither can create Unfällen life, which is what the Ancients are striving towards. The He-Ancient, as a child, "sought perfection in friends, in lovers, in nature, in things outside myself. Alas! I could not create it: I could only imagine it." This realiza- tion leads him "to the truth that you can create nothing but yourself." In Blakean terms, the creative power of Tharmas is separated from the creative imagination of Los in a fallen world where Albion's members are outside himself, in an externalized nature; true creativity can take place only in oneself, and Eden can be created when Albion rises and absorbs the natural world and all the Zoas into himself. The She- Ancient as a child was an artist and strove "to create perfection in things outside myself. I made statues: I painted pictures: I tried to worship them." But she found there "was no life in them" and turned from art. Now she is able to tell the youngsters: ... art is the magic mirror you make to reflect your invisible dreams in visible pictures. You use a glass mirror to see your face: you use works of art to see your soul. But we who are older use neither glass mirrors nor works of art. We have a direct sense of life. When you gain that you will put aside your mirrors and statues, your toys and your dolls, [p. 242]46</page><page sequence="34">174 VALLI RAO The "last doll to be discarded" is the body which images the soul, for now the Ancients are strong enough to want to live directly the life of the soul. As the He- Ancient declares: This is my body, my blood, my brain; but it is not me. I am the eternal life, the perpetual resurrection; but [striking his body] this structure, this organism, this makeshift, can be made by a boy in a laboratory, and is held back from dissolution only by my use of it. Worse still, it can be broken by a slip of the foot, drowned by a cramp in the stomach, de- stroyed by a flash from the clouds. Sooner or later, its destruction is certain, [p. 243] The Ancients want a body not subject to Circumstantial Selection. They explain how they contemplated the creative power in themselves and concentrated their will for fifty years, so as to gain power over their bodies. They gained the power of shaping their bodies into any form they desired. They experimented by transforming themselves into vari- ous fantastic monsters, before, as the She-Ancient tells, "suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me, and that it was only an automaton I had enslaved." In Blakean terms, they saw the Covering Cherub revealed, "magestic image/Of Selfhood, Body put off, the An- tichrist accursed" (J 89). Now they no longer waste their creative power in making superfluous bodily organs. Their preoccupation is one con- cerned with deliverance from the body. "Whilst we are tied to this tyrannous body we are subject to its death, and our destiny is not achieved." Their destiny is "To be immortal. . . . The day will come when there will be no people, only thought. . . . And that will be life eternal." Their striving is to be a vortex - "the whirlpool in pure intelli- gence" as Lilith puts it - the power over natural things, as the He- Ancient explains (p. 248). A great many questions arise from critics as to the desirability or purpose of the Ancients' embracing a life of Thought (which is what the Greeks meant by the "Word" of God, Shaw explains in the Post- script to Back to Methuselah, p. 267) as distinct from the life of Flesh as we know it. We will here look at only a few, and see whether a Blakean interpretation might help clear some confusion. Margery Morgan thinks Shaw is pushing to logical extremes "the pull away from nature, the desire to escape human limitations," with the result that the An- cients are "grotesque images of misshapen creatures, lapsed into non- communicating isolation, absorbed in a contemplation that seems no better than self-absorption" (The Shavian Playground, p. 237). According to a Blakean reading, self-absorption is the "Selfish Center" (J 71), the attribute of Satan (J 33), the Selfhood's parody of the Eternal Man's</page><page sequence="35">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 175 expanded center, and the very quality that man gets rid of when he gets rid of his natural body and acquires the enlarged vision of spiritual existence. As Jerusalem 57 describes, "Wonder seiz'd all in Eternity, to behold the Divine Vision open/The Center into an Expanse, &amp; the Center rolled out into an Expanse." Blake's critics have distinguished the reality from the parody in a way that might be useful in distinguish- ing the Ancients' "isolation" from the Selfhood's isolation in the natural body. As one critic writes: To have one's center in oneself is not the same as being selfish. The selfish center is formed without, Blake reminds us. When one is self-centered or selfish, he is contracted into a tiny involved mass outside of himself and consequently outside of others. When he has his center within himself, its circumference expands into eternity to include others.47 It is important to realize that Shaw, in postulating a life of the Spirit as distinct from natural life, may not be labelled a "dualist" who ranges mind against matter or spirit against flesh, or soul against body.48 As Shaw writes to Ervine, his position is rather that "the passion of the body will finally become [my emphasis] a passion of the mind" (Bernard Shaw, p. 384). In the words of Blake's Milton, Generation is to be "swallow'd up in Regeneration" (M 41). Frosch's book The Awakening of Albion aims to show that the Blakean Eden is one where the five natural senses are not discarded so much as expanded to compose the risen spiritual body of Albion, where sexuality is not confined to genitality but expanded to include all the body. As Blake says m Jerusalem: For the Sanctuary of Eden is in the Camp, in the Outline, In the Circumference, &amp; every Minute Particular is Holy: Embraces are Cominglings from the Head even to the Feet, And not a pompous High Priest entering by a Secret Place. U 69] In Eden, Frosch remarks, "imagination and sexual love reassume their identity, just as soul and body or perception and creation" (p. 176). C.E.M. Joad and A.M. Gibbs are unsatisfied with Shaw's giving no hint of what the Ancients contemplate.49 I suppose the only answer one can give to the question all of us must ask Shaw - "What does one do as an intellectual vortex; is the exercise of becoming one pointless?" - is that the sleeping man cannot imagine what he will do when he awakes; and yet creative activity (which is a state of wakefulness as opposed to the passivity of eternal sleep, where fitful dreams are the only, and sometimes distorted, hints of conscious reality) is pleasurable and god- like. Shaw does imagine one of the activities of the awakened man in Farfetched Fables (1948-49). He brings on stage a disembodied vortex</page><page sequence="36">176 VALLI RAO who has incarnated himself as a body and appears, to a sixth form class, as a youth clothed in feathers. In response to clamorous question- ing from the students and teacher, he tells them: I am an embodied thought. I am what you call the word made flesh. . . . Evolution can go backwards as well as forwards. If the body can become a vortex, the vortex can also become a body. ... I am curious to know what it is like to be a body. Curiosity never dies. . . . [pp. 129-30] In Jerusalem, Plate 98, Blake writes of the risen Albion, and one of his activities consists in this, that "Time, place, age and death are 'created' for momentary interest, as a story is, and then put away":50 And they conversed together in Visionary forms dramatic which bright Redounded from their Tongues in thunderous majesty, in Visions In new Expanses, creating exemplars of Memory and of Intellect Creating Space, Creating Time according to the wonders Divine Of Human Imagination throughout all the Three Regions immense Of Childhood, Manhood &amp; Old Age; &amp; the all tremendous unfathomable Non Ens Of Death was seen in regenerations terrific or complacent, varying According to the subject of discourse &amp; every Word &amp; Every Character Was Human according to the Expansion or Contraction, the Translucence or Opakeness of Nervous fibres: such was the variation of Time and Space Which vary according as the Organs of Perception vary &amp; they walked To 8c fro in Eternity as One Man reflecting each in each 8c clearly seen And seeing: according to fitness &amp; order. One thing is certain. Life in Eden is not a static paradise in either Shaw or Blake. What Frosch writes of Blake's paradise is equally true of the goal for which the Ancients reach out (and which Raphael, the disembodied thought, has achieved in Farfetched Fables): . . . there is no finality in this accomplishment [of replacing the natural world by Jerusalem, a world of emanation, the bride and creation of Albion], for Blake's paradise is not the end-point of a linear develop- ment, but a state of perpetual creative activity. Eden itself moves, going from Eternity to Eternity, creation to creation. [The Awakening of Albion, pp. 151-52] Albion moves "forward irresistible from Eternity to Eternity," as Jerusa- lem 98 informs us. This is the gist of the final lines of Lilith's speech, that Mankind should dread stagnation of all things, that when the Ancients attain redemption from flesh they will supersede her, that of Life only there is no end. "The power and the glory, world without end," as Franklyn Barnabas had quoted in Act II, means that there is no Limit of Translucence.</page><page sequence="37">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 177 Notes 1.

It is well to clarify here that the purpose of this essay is not to demonstrate that Shaw consciously borrowed concepts from the Blakean myth, nor that Shaw had read Blake. My purpose is to show that Shaw's plays (especially Back to Methuselah) lend themselves to illuminating analysis and interpretation in the light of the Blakean myth. Of course, Shaw had read Blake; and that he regarded Blake with consistent admiration, and studied him throughout his writing career, is evident from Shaw's own writings. Readers who are interested in Shaw's direct references to Blake may consult the Appendix to my thesis, "Bernard Shaw's Religious Vision: A Blakean Interpretation of his Plays" (Doctoral the- sis, Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide, 1978), pp. 266-83; and my article "Vivie Warren in the Blakean World of Experience," Shaw Review, 22 (1979), 123-24. 3.

This aspect ot the Female Will is represented by such Blakean figures as Vala, Rahab (who is "Vala drawn down into a Vegetated body" and whom Blake indentifies</page><page sequence="38">178 VALU RAO with the biblical Whore of Babylon), and Rahab's daughter Tirzah, the Prude who con- trols man by denying him his sexual desires and who thereby directs man's energies into war: "I must rush again to War, for the Virgin has frown'd 8c refus'd" (/ 68:63).

For a compact discussion of Shaw's manipulation of Weismann's views on the nature of death, see Louis Crompton, Shaw the Dramatist (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1969), pp. 172-73. 14. Criticism such as St. John Ervine's in Bernard Shaw: His Life, Work and Friends (New York: William Morrow, 1956), which opines that Shaw in such passages is allying himself with those who banish mind from the world, arises from a lack of distinction between the Will attached to the Selfhood and the Will attached to the Imagination. 15. Compare/ 54, where the Spectre of Albion, boasting that he is "Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke," mocks Jesus for preaching "an unknown Eternal Life" without empirical foundation in a world which he sees as constituting only "craving lust &amp; devouring appetite." 16. The Shavian counterpart to this adage is that "the human animal, as he exists at present" is not capable of "solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation, or, as he calls it, his civilization" (Preface to Back to Methuselah, p. x). 17. "A Glimpse of the Domesticity of Franklyn Barnabas" is a continuation of Part II of Back to Methuselah which was discarded from the play and published separately in The Black Girl in Search of God and Some Lesser Tales (pp. 213-59). 18.

It is interesting to note that as man evolves further, the Mother figure gets correspondingly less possessive in her hold over him. Eve in Act I controls her husband and sons with a maternal possessiveness which is Mother Nature's clutching, constrictive hold of her children. In Act II, Savvy (short for Savage; her real name is Cynthia, no doubt an allusion to the moon Goddess of Chastity) is a Tirzah-figure like Vivie Warren in Mrs Warren's Profession: both Vivie and Savvy have had a University education, have intellectual pretensions, smoke, and play tennis; and though Savvy, unlike Vivie, gets married, she has no children (as we learn in Act III, p. 115), which is consonant with her image as a 1920 Eve who has, Tirzah-like, urged men to war (p. 85) and who represents an acme of barrenness. With the acceptance on man's part of a life-span of 300 years, things begin to improve. Mrs Lutestring in Act III, though still "Dianesque" (p. 1 10), is much more liberal than Eve or Savvy-Cynthia, and she wants no strangling hold over the children that she and the Archbishop will have for the sake of the race: "I never was very</page><page sequence="39">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 179 fond of children, except that one girl who woke up the mother passion in me" (p. 1 18). Her attitude to children leads to Zoo's in Act IV, matter-of-fact and business-like: "I specialize in babies. My first was such a success that they made me go on" (p. 147). She is amazed that the Elderly Gentleman's mother bothered about him after he was ten years old. He protests that it was natural, as she was his mother, and asks Zoo "What would you have had her do?" Zoo replies: "Go on to the next, of course. After eight or nine children become quite uninteresting, except to themselves. I shouldnt know my two eldest if I met them" (p. 148). The She-Ancient in Act V is a Mother figure who delivers the Newly Born from her egg, gives her a quick medical examination to make sure she is healthy, gives her also a brief talk on childhood and adulthood, and then leaves her to discover the world for herself. 21.

Blake's Milton, Plate 13, tells us that "The sin was begun in Eternity. In A Vision of the Last Judgment, Blake writes: "Many suppose that before the Creation [of natural life, described in Genesis] All was Solitude &amp; Chaos. This is the most pernicious Idea that can enter the Mind, as it takes away all sublimity from the Bible 8c Limits All Existence to Creation &amp; Chaos, To the Time &amp; Space fixed by the Corporeal Vegetative Eye . . ."

Natural man is sometimes described in Blake as serpentine, as George Mills Harper points out, quot- ing Tiriel, "men bound beneath the heavens in a reptile form," Keynes p. 110; The Book of Urizen, Keynes p. 236; and The Song of Los, Keynes p. 246 (The Neoplatonism of William Blake [Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1961], p. 236). See also Fearful Symme- try, pp. 136-37. For the serpent as a sexual symbol see Damon's interpretation in A Blake Dictionary, p. 366, and Fearful Symmetry, pp. 445-46. 28. See Fearful Symmetry, p. 136. Fisher points out that the serpent is "a form which Blake associates with eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil" (The Valley of Vision, p. 146). In Back to Methuselah, the Serpent says she "chose wisdom and the knowledge of good and evil" (p. 252). She tempts Eve to "bite the apple you dread" (p. 9). 29. Harry M. Geduld, "The Lineage of Lilith," Shaw Review, 7 (1964), 58-61, traces the legends associated with Lilith as a demonic female as well as the " female incarnation of the Evolutionary Appetite." See p. 60 for the link between the evolutionary breeding of the Superman in Man and Superman, and the legend of Lilith in Back to Methuselah, and particularly, the link between Ann Whitefield and Lilith. 30. J. B. Kaye shows how Shaw's Lilith as the evolutionary appetite interprets the meaning of the "Good and JVWj [Lilith]" serpent in Blake's The Laocoön (Bernard Shaw and the Nineteenth Century Tradition [Norman: Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1958], pp. 126-27). 31. Eno in The Four Zoas is, as Frye puts it, "a daughter of Beulah or inspiration [through whose eyes] Blake sees the whole of existence projected in the form of a single</page><page sequence="40">180 VALLI RAO drama of fall, redemption and apocalypse" (Fearful Symmetry, p. 270). Lilith's speech at the end of Back to Methuselah puts the play in the same perspective to her. Lilith's strong iden- tity with Erin is clear when her speech is compared withy 1 1, pp. 48-50, 74, 86, and 94. 32. As Stevenson explains, Blake "visualizes the island of England as the giant Al- bion, stretched out in sleep, so he sees the neighbouring island Ireland as a beautiful woman, Erin, who sits by him, watches over him, and shields him from the full force of the destructive Atlantic waves" (The Poems of William Blake, ed. W.H. Stevenson, text David V. Erdman [London: Longman, 1971], p. 646). The parallel with Lilith, guarding mankind, is obvious. 33. The Spectre of Albion is to be distinguished from Los's Spectre (who is the Spectre of Urthona), in the same spirit as Darwin is to be distinguished from Weismann. The Spectre of Albion is identified with Luvah in/ 47:3. Luvah in turn "is named Satan because he has enter'd that State: a World where Man is by Nature the enemy of Man" (J 49). 34. Arthur H. Nethercot remarks that "Lua was a Roman goddess, associated with Saturn, to whom captured arms were devoted" (Men and Supermen: The Shavian Portrait Gallery [1954; rpt. New York: Blom, 1966], p. 300). 35. We remember that the bird in Haslam's garden had, in Act II, advised him to "stick it or chuck it" as a clergyman (p. 40). 36. For details of the stages through which the Ore cycle proceeds, see Fearful Sym- metry, p. 211. 37. Wisenthal points out the similarity between Barnabas and de Stogumber (The Marriage of Contraries, p. 212). ao. rrye explains how Job and Jesus in their death represent the death ot the natural man: "One thing that Blake clearly saw in the story of Job was a microcosm of the whole biblical story. . . . Job occupies the place of Adam or Israel or Blake's own Albion, the symbolic figure of humanity. ..." ("Blake's Reading of the Book of Job," William Blake: Essays for S. Foster Damon, ed. A. H. Rosenfeld [Providence: Brown Univ. Press, 1969], pp. 221-34). In Fearful Symmetry, Frye explains how "the career of Jesus is visualized in the Gospels as a recreation or epitome of the story of Israel" (p. 370) and how the point of the crucifixion scene in Chapter III oí Jerusalem is "to show that Jesus also [like other human beings sacrificed in religion and war] was killed as a Luvah in the role of the dying Albion" (p. 398). 39. I his is the state ot Innocence shown in Illustration I ot Blake s Illustrations of the Book of Job (first copy made about 1820). Job's innocence is well interpreted by S. Foster Damon in Blake's Job: With an Introduction and Commentary by S. Foster Damon (Providence: Brown Univ. Press, 1966), p. 12. 40. We see an example of the Elderly Gentleman at his best in the noble speech on his body as the temple of the Holy Ghost (pp. 151-52), which is as full of faith as Job's affirmation "For I know that my redeemer liveth . . . And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God" (Job 19.25,26). We also note that Job's unheeded plea to his friends - "But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?" (Job 19.28) - is responded to by Zoo as she remarks, at the end of the Elderly Gentleman's speech, "Bravo, Daddy! You have the root of the matter in you. You will not die of discouragement after all" (p. 152). For further examples of the Elderly Gentleman at his best, see pp. 153-54, 157, 182, 184-85, 186, 188, 193. 41. We see the Elderly Gentleman at his worst in such moments as when he indulges in nostalgic idealization of the past (p. 148); and when, deplorably, he forms an audience to the Envoy (pp. 190-91); and in his notion of a civilized country as one where he can travel comfortably and there are good hotels (p. 142); and when he speaks condescend- ingly of the "agricultural laborer" and the "lower classes" (p. 138).</page><page sequence="41">Methuselah: a blakean interpretation 181 42.

There is also an implicit reference to 1 Corinthians 13.1 1: "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." Eugene Tanzy, in an article which on the whole does not, in my opinion, do justice to Shaw's views on evolution, comments very appropriately on the role of art in Part V: "In the end, Shaw's artists turn their backs on art itself. This is not a Shavian repudiation of the means by which he worked. Art lasts, for Shaw, as long as man lasts. Art remains until the consummation of the world, but no longer - as long, that is, as we are compelled, as St. Paul put it, to see through a glass darkly. Art is needed to lead man to the perfect vision; it ceases to have any function once the ultimate stage is reached . . ."

Gibbs, Shaw (Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1969), p. 78; L. Crompton, Shaw the Dramatist, p. 187. 49. C.E.M. Joad, wondering what the Ancients think about, writes: "It is, perhaps, the absence of any answer to the question in Shaw which has seemed to some people to leave his whole philosophy hanging, as it were, in the air, a philosophy of Life arising from a nothingness and developing in a vacuum in pursuit of a purpose which is left undefined" (Shaw and Society: An Anthology and a Symposium, ed. C.E.M. Joad [1951; rpt. Folcroft Library Editions, 1970], p. 243. A.M. Gibbs writes: "In the final analysis there is a teasing circularity about the superman philosophy. . . . Shaw can only postpone the answer to C.E.M. Joad's question as to what the contemplative supermen are supposed to contemplate, until the superman arrives to tell us" (Shaw, pp. 36-37). 50. So W.H. Stevenson paraphrases in his edition of The Poems of William Blake, p. 839.</page></plain_text>
