W. Catling Introduction This CHAPTER CONSIDERS ALL THE pottery which on grounds of taxonomy (fabric, form and finish) precedes Protogeometric, albeit individual pieces were found with PG material. The section, therefore, starts with the question 'What is Subminoan?'. The answer given here will certainly not satisfy everyone; it may not satisfy anyone. It is a justification for not classifying the material as LM III, on the one hand, PG on the other. The opening of the N Cemetery is a significant landmark in the history of Knossos. It seems appropriate to recognize that landmark by adopting it as a milestone in the evolution of Minoan decorated pottery so that, by definition, it is recognized that all the pottery still preserving Minoan characteristics should be categorized as Subminoan (SM). Though in strict terms of Minoan ceramic development, this will raise some eyebrows, it nevertheless acknowledges the break at Knossos symbolized by the beginning of this long-lived burial ground, which will surely come to be seen as an important factor for understanding the Cretan Dark Ages. No great violence is done to existing classification, for much of the material studied here anyway conforms to accepted ideas of the character of SM pottery. A limited number of vases (particularly the group in T. 200) should perhaps also be seen as LM III C, on the understanding that their context is, a fortiori, SM. By recognizing that possibility for the earliest material from the site, we can better defend the classification as SM of vases found with some of the earliest PG material. Examination of the 74 vases studied here as SM has emphasized the imprecision of the term 'Subminoan', an imprecision felt most strongly at the outer limits of the classification. How do we recognize the end of LM III C on the one hand, and the beginning of (Cretan) PG on the other? The Minoan tradition was as persistent as the Mycenaean; and the difference between Late Minoan III B (thirteenth century) and Subminoan (roughly the first half of the eleventh century) was just as great as between LH III B and Submycenaean'. So wrote Desborough in 1972. l Much earlier2 he had said The arrival of Protogeometric influence (sc. in Crete) may show itself in several ways: in the actual technique of the potter, first, in an improvement in the fabric, in a more expert use of the wheel . . . resulting in the existing shapes being made more firmly and with clearer lines; then, in the introduction of new shapes, and lastly, in the introduction of new schemes of decoration, and decorative motives, both as applied to the new shapes, or as adapted to the existing shapes. These are guide-lines, indeed, but not always enough for the individual case. 1 ODA 57. 2/^^237.</page><page sequence="13">296 H. W. CATLING Part of the difficulty comes from the different experience on the mainland (particularly in Athens) and what happened in Crete. There is an understandable reluctance to use terminology that concedes the survival of distinctive SM traits side-by-side with the ceramic phenomena that distinguish the PG. To some degree this is conditioned by the direction from which the individual ceramic scholar approaches the problem. In recent years it has been quite substantially seen in PG terms, so that it has become natural to regard a complex as wholly PG if it comprises any PG material. This is unfortunate, for it blurs the fact that easily recognizable SM traits survived for some considerable time after the evolution of material in Crete, omnium consensu, PG in form, ornament and finish. By extension, this can be seen as an illustration of the ambivalence of some of our language used in archaeological characterisation, language often responsible for circularity in argument. The problem centres, indeed, on such terms as Trotogeometric' and 'Subminoan'. These began, surely, as terms to describe categories of pottery, for which, incidentally, both relative and absolute chronologies could be established. But they have also, insensibly, taken on a much wider connotation, so that Protogeometric has come also to be understood as a particular period, with a beginning and an end, one that is quite distinct from what went before and what came after. This leads to a type of archaeological false syllogism of the kind 'All pottery decorated with concentric circles is Protogeometric; these vases have been found with concentric circle-decorated vases, therefore they must be Protogeometric too'. The point has only to be made in that extreme form for its weakness to be seen. To recapitulate, it seems, in the case of the EIA pottery of Crete, to be more accurate to recognize the survival of specifically SM vase shapes and types of ornament at a time when much other pottery in circulation was modelled not on the past but on the new developments in Athens and Attica which we term Trotogeometric', than to lump all this material together and describe it as Trotogeometric' without distinction. I accept that this may merely be to isolate the difference between a conservative potter/painter and an innovator, both craftsmen perhaps sitting in the same shop. I have therefore included a number of vases from groups containing PG pottery. I may not have done so consistently, and there are surely other vases SM in tradition found with truly PG fellows that I have overlooked. There is no similar problem at the upper end of my SM spectrum, with the reservation that the series starts with material which, on its own, might well be classed as LM III C. This survey considers 74 vases found in eighteen separate tombs (Ts. 200-202 are considered as a single tomb for this purpose). Though 21 tombs are identified as SM, three (149, 153, and 282) contained no finds, and are not considered here. There are eighteen forms, nine of which occur once only. The stirrup jar is the most common (26 examples), followed by the neck-handled amphora (sixteen examples). The series chiefly comprises closed shapes; the open shapes - bowl, cup, deep cup - each occur only once. The three necked pithoi were found in PG company (T. 48). Though the series contains vases of a considerable size range, small vases form a majority of the shapes and at least half the examples. The relative proportions and distributions of the shapes among the eighteen tombs is of interest. First, four of the eighteen shapes between them account for 73% of all SM vases, viz. stirrup jars, 35.1%; neck-handled amphorae, 23%; neck-handled amphoriskoi, 8.1%; flasks, 6.7%. Stirrup jars were found in 83.3% of tombs, neck-handled amphorae in 55.5%, flasks in 11.1%, neck-handled amphoriskoi in 5.5%. No tomb had more than seven of the eighteen shapes (T. 40, with 44%). Ts. 121 and 207 had five (31%), Ts. 2, 48, and 98 each had three (19%).</page><page sequence="14">THE SUBMINOAN POTTERY 2g7 Numbers of SM vases in each tomb varied from one (six tombs - 16, 56, 160, 186, 208, F/67:i4) to fourteen (207, 20.5% of all SM vases). Only one other tomb (40) had ten or more vases. Two tombs (48, 121) contained seven and eight vases respectively, six tombs (2, 18, 45, 98, 112, and 200) from three to five. In two cases (Ts. 160, 186) where only one vase was found, it is certain only one burial/cremation was involved. On the other hand, in 121, where there were three burials, seven vases had been deposited. Variation in fabric, technique, and finish is more apparent than real; the series, indeed, is sufficiently homogeneous to suppose a single manufacturing source, presumably Knossian. The fabric of the small-medium vases is fairly fine, sometimes granular in texture, with some vesicles, and a range of colour that is normally brown or light brown, occasionally varying to cream, or tones of red. Inclusions are few and small. Firing is even, no more than medium- hard; some examples are softer. The surface finish is usually smooth, a lighter colour than the biscuit through the self-slipping process. Paint is nearly always matt, often fugitive; the colour ranges from red (uncommon) via reddish-brown to dark brown, occasionally almost black. Drawing is never slovenly, even where patterns are very simple; the more complex designs (e.g. 200.3) are executed with great care, both in the filling of space, and the control of line. The fabric of the larger vases (neck-handled amphorae, belly-handled amphorae, kraters) is coarser, sometimes much coarser, usually with many inclusions (grit; sometimes, fine black sand). The colour is predominantly tones of brown, with a few examples reddish-brown to red. A minority is pinkish-buff, or pinkish-cream, and finer textured. The firing varies considerably from hard to soft, and may be uneven, with grey cores of varying thickness. The surfaces are usually self-slipped, occasionally rather rough, in varying tones of cream through dark cream to light brown. The colour range of paint is the same as the small-medium vases. Ornament, other than banding, is confined to the shoulder-zone of closed vases (always excepting 200.3) and varies from extreme simplicity (the 'S' pattern on amphorae and flasks) to great linear complexity (200.1, 2, and 3). Closed Shapes stirrup jars The 26 vases are fairly heterogeneous in size and form, though certain groups suggest themselves. Within a range of heights from 10 cm to 25.2, thirteen examples are between 10 and 15 cm high, nine examples between 15 and 20 cm, four between 20 and 25.2. Within a range of diameters between 8.0 and 19.3, fourteen examples are between 8 and 12, six between 12 and 16, six between 16 and 19.3. The relationship between height and diameter is a useful indicator of relationships. There are two main groupings, one often (160. 1; 121.3; 18.20; 112.3; I2I.2; 40.15; 98.20; 40.21; 40.12 and F/67:i4.i) where, within a range of heights of 12.6 to 14.8 cm, the diameters fluctuate between a minimum of 75% of the height to a maximum of 84%. The second grouping (of larger jars), within a height range from 17.3 to 23.8, comprises 18.19; 24-25 98-10; 112. 2; 186. 1; 200.1-3; the diameters fluctuate between a minimum of 80% to a maximum of 88.5% of the height. A third grouping, of three, (45*5; 48.1 and 207.19), in a height range of 11.8 to 20.1, has diameters that fluctuate from 63% to 67% of the height. None of the remaining vases can be linked; the proportions vary considerably - 64% (45-7); 72% (48.4); 80% (40.20); 94% (16.3); 98 % (2.2). The first two groupings have examples in the same tomb (e.g. 112.3 in the first, 112.2 in the second), and little chronological significance attaches to them. The third grouping consists of jars found with PG material.</page><page sequence="15">298 H. W. CATLING There is variety in the relationship of the accessories - spout, false neck, handles, disc, nipple. In the majority, the spout lip is level with the disc, often all but touching it, or slightly above or slightly below. A few - 45*7; 48.1 and 98.20 - have spouts considerably lower than the disc, angled away from the false neck. Every jar has a nipple on the disc, but there is much variety, from the almost imperceptible excrescence of 16.3, via the prominent cone-nipples of 40.12, 160. 1 and F/67:i4.i and others, to the unusual carefully modelled 'teat' attached to the disc of 112. 2. With the exception of 16.3, every jar has an air-hole, usually close to the false neck, on the side opposite the spout. Though the handles of most jars are no higher than the disc to which they are attached, they are higher on 2.2; 40.20; 45.7; 48.1; 48.4; 200.1 and 207.19. It is difficult to detect any chronological significance in this feature; 200.1 should be one of the earliest jars, while T. 48 contains PG material. Shape has somewhat arbitrarily been chosen as the chief criterion for identifying groups within this material; the main element relied upon is body profile. This method has isolated seventeen jars attributable to five groups, of which two account for only two jars each. Six jars are treated as singletons, one (200.3) as exceptional. This last begins the arrangement, for its body is almost completely spherical, apart from the inevitable divergence to the ring foot. The groups are arranged in the order in which they depart from this optimum spherical shape. The two large jars of Group 1 (98.10 and 200.1) have a slight upward shift in their centre of gravity but are still nearly spherical; they have significantly higher ring feet than 200.3. In Group 2 (112.2 and 200.2) the upward shift of the centre of gravity is more noticeable, though the ring feet are little higher than 200.3. Group 3 (18.19 and i86.i, with 98.20 'near' them) has a profile sensibly depressed, with a centre of gravity roughly in mid-body. The two jars in the group have ring feet as Group 2, but 98.20 has a low cone-foot. Group 4, all smaller jars (18.20; 40.12, 15, 21; I2I.2 and F/67:i4*i, with i6o.i 'near' the group) is the clearest instance: all the jars have a depressed globular profile and incipient cone-feet. The three examples from T. 40 stand slightly apart from the others in having a rather higher centre of gravity. Their similarity is close enough to suppose a common origin. i6o.i, 'near' Group 4, is dumpier, and has minor points of decorative difference. The five jars of Group 5 (45.5, 7; 48.1, 4 and 207.19), though of varied size, are alike in their relatively slim, oval profile. All but 45.7 have a centre of gravity at mid-body; 45.7 is a little higher. 48.4 has an incipient cone-foot; 45.7 and 207.19 have quite high cone-feet, but 45.5 and 48.1 have splaying feet of a kind otherwise missing in the series. Of the singletons, 16.3, 40.20 and 121.3 are alike in their pronounced depressed globular profiles, but otherwise stand apart from each other. 2.2, largest of the medium sized jars, has a depressed, almost biconical profile, and incipient cone- foot. 24.2, a large jar, superficially as Group 1, is distinct in its accessories, especially its cone- foot. The small jar 112.3 recalls Group 3, but is slimmer and neater, with different accessories. The painted decoration of the jars is, superficially, closely homogeneous. The accessories (handles, false neck, disc, spout) usually receive some perfunctory attention, while the body of the jar is divided into zones by groups of encircling bands of differing composition, on or just below the shoulders, and on the lower body. There is normally, but not invariably, a band of paint on the foot, sometimes covering it completely, sometimes leaving the 'lip' of the foot reserved. The space between the shoulder bands and the lower body bands is, with the exception of 200.3, left reserved. The small cross drawn on 121.3 must, so far as concerns the design of the vase, have been unintentional. Distinctive ornament is concentrated upon the shoulder zone, arranged to respect the spout, false neck and handles. Such ornament varies form the extremely complex (200.3) to the very simple (48.1). For the disc, the most frequent ornament is the spiral, sometimes with a large solid dot at the</page><page sequence="16">THE SUBMINOAN POTTERY 299 centre (40.15; 121.2). Exceptions are the concentric circles of 45.7; 112.2, 3; i6o.i, the encircled cross of 40.20, the hatching of 16.3 and the solid paint of 2.2; 45.5; 48.1; 98.20 and 207.19. The false neck itself is consistently reserved; only 40.20 and 121. 3 have a succession of strokes, though 16.3; 18.20; 48.4 and 200.1 have a band of paint encircling the neck-root. There is some variety in the treatment of the spout. Though there is solid paint inside the spout-mouth of nearly every jar, 98.10 has a reserved band just inside the lip, then solid paint, while the inside of 121. 3's mouth is reserved except for paint on the lip. The spout outside may have paint on the lip (three-fifths of the jars do), paint surrounding the root (16.3; 112.2, 3 and 160. 1) and, in the great majority of cases, a vertical panel of horizontal paint strokes from lip to root. Exceptions are 48.4 (where vertical lines convert the strokes into ladder pattern), 45.7 (vertical zigzag), 16.3; 112.2, 3 and 160. 1 (reserved, apart from the paint surrounding the root - see above). There is some variety in handle decoration. The most frequent scheme is, again, a vertical panel of horizontal paint strokes; other forms include the conversion of the strokes into ladder pattern by outlining the handles in paint (16.3; 45.5; 200.2), simply outlining otherwise reserved handles (40.20), partly covering in solid paint. 207.19 has solid paint at the handle tops, strokes below. Three jars of Group 5 - 45.7; 48.1, 4 - have strokes arranged in groups. On 200.1 there are groups of oblique strokes. 200.3 has horizontal zigzags, neatly drawn; the handle-roots are outlined. The decoration of the shoulder-zones is the most conspicuous feature of nearly all the jars. The most frequent scheme uses the available space as four quadrants, two of which, between the spout and the handles, actually exist while two more are artificially created on the opposite side of the jar, often having the air-hole at their apices. In each quadrant is drawn a triangle, frequently double-, occasionally treble-outlined. To accommodate these triangles to the intrusion of the spout, they are drawn with concave sides adjacent to the spout; for the sake of symmetry, no doubt, two matching sides are concave, with a straight base-line resting on the uppermost encircling band. These are balanced by similar concave-sided triangles on the opposite side, producing, in the absence this side of a spout, what looks at first sight like an elongated vertical ellipse as the centrepiece of the ornamental scheme. The vase-painter sometimes shows awareness of the effect he has - surely inadvertently - created by picking out this ellipse with a vertical panel of small chevrons (200.3), or short superimposed strokes (112. 2). Very rarely (121. 3), all three sides of the triangles are concave, leaving a semi- elliptical space between each triangle and the ground-line. The spaces in this one case are hatched. In some cases, triangles on the side opposite the spout are straight-sided, so that they are not divided by an ellipse but by a parallelogram or by lines converging from the air-hole downwards (18.20; 24.2; 112.3; I«i.3 and i6o.i). It has been suggested by some scholars3 that there is chronological significance in the change from curvilinear designs (i.e. those, in our case, resulting in the ellipse) to straight line designs (i.e. parallelogram or converging lines); this would suggest, if so, that 18.20 etc. are later than, for instance, 40.12, 15 and 21. Though this may be so, the N Cemetery evidence neither confirms nor denies it. It may be noted, though, that 112.2 has the ellipse, 112.3 a parallelogram. 22 out of 26 stirrup jars are decorated with triangles; they are distinguished by the way in which the triangles are filled. In the more elaborate examples, individual triangles on the same vase are not necessarily treated similarly; in some cases, indeed, each triangle has a different filling (48.4; 200.2); in others there are three schemes - an identical pair and two different 3 E.g. GDA 58.</page><page sequence="17">300 H. W. CATLING again, and from each other (2.2). 112.3 has two types, in pairs. On 160. 1 are three alike, the fourth quite different; 186. 1 also has three alike and a fourth different, but the difference is much less apparent. Several have all four triangles identical (40.21; 24.2). 121.2 is very unusual for having the normal pair of triangles on the spout side of the shoulder, but only one on the opposite side, set in the centre. The normal decorative scheme enriches the individual triangles by fillings of concentric arcs (rare) or hatching (common). Uniform cross-hatching is also rare (2.2; 112.3; 160.1). Two jars (45.7; 48.4), both Group 5, do not follow these schemes. 45.7 has a pair of triangles on the spout side, one of which is equally divided between vertical and oblique hatching; the other triangle has one half vertically hatched, and the other half partly horizontally hatched, partly taken up with neatly drawn zigzag. On the opposite side the triangles have dissolved into antithetic hatched areas either side of a central panel of dot-filled lozenges. 48.4, with the four different triangles already noted, has two largely filled with various arrangements of concentric arcs, while the other two have cross-hatched base-angles and fringed lozenge- shaped motifs pendent from the apex, one partly solid-filled the other angle-hatched. The fringing recalls the earlier, elaborately decorated vases of the Fringed Style.4 Concentric arcs are of two types - in groups of three with dot-centre, as a scale-pattern (200.3), and angle- filling, in groups (200.1). This scheme leaves an empty space at the centre of the triangle which, on 200.1, contains groups of fringed parallel lines. The most characteristic filling pattern for the triangles is angle-hatching, seen in its simplest form on, e.g. 40.21; F/67:i4.i, where two angles are hatched, one left reserved. On other examples (e.g. 18.19; 11 2.2) all three angles are hatched, leaving a roughly triangular area reserved at the triangle's centre. This area may in its turn be treated as a triangle to be angle- hatched (seen once on 200.2, twice on 200.3, three times (all that is preserved) on the carelessly drawn 98.10, and at least twice on the badly damaged 16.3). Several times, as though to relieve the tedium of his work, the painter introduced a minor variation, as on 186. 1 where the filling of one angle on one triangle treats the angle as though it were itself a triangle; the kind of feature that may have passed unnoticed. But the variations seen on, say, 2OO.2, where some angles are treated with antithetic hatching, or 2.2, where one triangle has a different treatment in each angle, another a unique design where three concentric triangles are erected on the main triangle's base-line, and much of the interspace picked out by hatching, must have been meant for the customer's eye. Very occasionally the painter wearies of the basic scheme and produces (18.20) what looks at a quick glance like angle-hatched triangles on one side but is actually a slovenly arrangement of alternating hatching across the surface of the triangles. Three Group 5 jars are quite differently treated; 45.5 and 207.19 have rather perfunctory lines of paint strokes in the shoulder spaces, while 48.1 has similarly arranged groups of very spindly scribble. 40.20 has distinctly different ornament from the rest of the series. The quadrants separating the spout from the handles each contain boldly drawn chevrons, arranged to look like a palm frond. At the centre of the opposite side is an outlined cross-hatched triangle flanked on either side by smaller sets of chevrons. The arrangement of body ornament is, in broad terms, homogeneous, always involving a 4 BSA 55 (i960), 17 and n. 38; 30-37. LMTS 173.

The three Group 4 jars from 40 (12, 15, 21) and F/67:i4.i are all reserved between the shoulder band and the foot; at their shoulders is a broad band between pairs of fine bands. The significance of the considerable minor variations in these shoulder band arrangements is not apparent, though the T. 40 evidence suggests that a given painter repeated his banding patterns. 200.3 is exceptional in the rich decoration of the body below the shoulder bands, where there is a neatly drawn net-pattern, or chequer-board of lozenges, alternately cross- hatched and reserved, the reserved lozenges each picked out by a circle-and-dot. The abnormal ornament continues in the solid paint that covers the lower body and foot, recalling a very common feature in the design of Cypriot Proto-White Painted stirrup jars.5 FLASKS The five flasks (40.13, 14, 17; 121. 1, 5) are very similar in form and decoration; the differences are of trivial importance. The trio from T. 40 vary only from 15.7- 15.3 in height, and 12.4-12.1 in diameter, the pair from T 121 from 12.6-11.8 and 10.1-9.8 respectively. The diameter-height relationship is narrowly defined, from a maximum of 83% (121. 1) to a minimum of 78% (40.13). The heaviest of the T. 40 flasks (17 - 311g) is only 2.9% heavier than the others, which both scale at 302g. The profiles are depressed globular, with a slightly varying centre of gravity, relatively high on 40.13, 14 and 121.5, lower on 40.17 and 121. 1. The accessories are nearly identical - slim cylindrical necks, trumpet mouths, a pair of opposite vertical handles attached immediately below the lip (121. 1, 5), or further below, leaving the lips clear. All have a high, virtually cone-foot. Ornament is standard - a band of paint on the lip in and out, horizontal strokes of paint from top to bottom of the handles, an elongated horizontal 'S' on the shoulder either side, the neck-root outlined with paint (not on 12 1.5), a group of encircling bands below the shoulder (one broad band between pairs of fine bands), a single band below the centre of gravity (missing on 121.5) and, on the T. 40 trio, a band on the foot, leaving the foot 'lip' reserved. SMALL OINOCHOAI Two examples (40.18; 121. 4) differ somewhat in the form of their rising handles, but should be taken together. They are close in size (heights 10.6 and 11.3, diameters 7.0 and 6.4 respectively). 40.18 weighs ioig, one third of the mass of the flasks in the same tomb. Their depressed globular profiles are dissimilar; 40.18 has a high centre of gravity, 121.4 is much lower. The accessories include a simple trefoil mouth, incipient cone-foot and rising handle. The diameter of 40.18 is 66% of its total height, 76% of the height to the lip. The corresponding figures for 121.4 are 56.5% and 76%. Both have rising handles, but 121.4 is higher, with a sinuous outline, of rather clumsy appearance. Both are partly coated (including the handles) with dark paint; the inside of the mouth is reserved, strongly suggesting that the coating was brushed on, not dipped. 5 Pieridou, PGRK, pl. 14.9.</page><page sequence="19">302 H- w- CATLING THELASTRON ('FEEDER VASE') The one example, 121.7, is 10.5 high, diameter 7.4; the diameter is 70% of the total height, 88% of the height to the lip. The profile is depressed globular. The accessories include a basket handle over a widely flaring mouth, prominent spout set at an acute angle, and incipient cone-foot. The back attachment of the handle projects beyond the lip as a kind of 'spur'. The handle, mouth in and out, spout and upper body are partly coated in dark paint whose outline on the body is consistent with dipping. NECK-HANDLED AMPHORAE Seventeen complete and fragmentary examples were identified, distributed among nine tombs. T. 207 contained four, T. 48 three, Ts. 24 and 98 two. There was one in each of Ts. 18, 40, 45, 56, 200 and 208. The shape has previously been identified as PG;6 There are, certainly, examples with PG material. The shape is probably more common in PG contexts. But there is no doubt that it is a SM shape; its presence in T. 200 is unambiguous, supported by the instance in T. 40. One - 207.30 - stands apart from the others through the substitution of smooth handles for the twisted handles which otherwise characterise the series. The amphorae all have an ovoid body, concave neck and flaring mouth. The handles are attached under the rim and on mid-shoulder. Bases are flat, though the underfoot may be slightly concave (98.11) or have an incipient foot-ring (40.16). The vases arrange themselves in three groups on grounds of size, so that Group 1 (eight examples) has a height range of 51-44 cm, Group 2 (four examples) 38-32 cm and Group 3, 27-23 cm. There is a fairly narrow range in height/diameter proportions, from a maximum of 81% (40.16, Group 2) to a minimum of 65% (48.9). The mean is 71.5%. Though the majority is well fashioned, 18.18, for example, was badly thrown, so that the neck and handle appear much off-centre. Ornament is standard through the series, with minor variations that seem of little significance. There is always a band of paint on the rim, which may extend inside; with the exception of 40.16 and 98.11, which are reserved, all have a band of paint within the mouth. 24.3 has two bands in this position. With the possible exception of 98.11, there is a broad band at the neck/shoulder junction. 207.51 is alone in having a horizontal band of scribble on the neck. The shoulder is set off from the rest of the body by a group of encircling bands well below the lower handle attachment. The lower body is similarly set off by two bands, and a final band is placed either on or immediately above the foot. The handles are the most distinctive accessories. They are heavy, more frequently round than oval in section, tooled before firing to appear twisted, by gouging channels out of the clay down and round the handle, from right to left. These channels were then picked out in paint. The lower handle attachments are usually boldly outlined in paint, sometimes (40.16) with a swag pendent from the neck-root band. On 200.4 this continues over the shoulder bands onto the body as a swirl There is a standard ornament in each shoulder of horizontal elongated '£* pattern (cf. ornament of flasks). Exceptions are 40.16, which has a centrally placed triple-outlined triangle, its lower angles hatched, its apex cross-hatched. It is flanked either side by a stemmed spiral. Also untypical is the fragmentary 45.6, which, in place of the elongated 'S' pattern has three small enclosed spirals in each shoulder zone, arranged horizontally.

SHOULDER-HANDLED AMPHORAE Two examples, 40.11 and 207.25, were found, heights 26.8 and 31.5, diameters 22.0 and 22.5 respectively, with height-diameter proportion of 82% and 71% respectively. From the ovoid body a prominent neck rises, mouth more flaring on 40.11. Bases are flat. The vertical handles are mounted horizontally on the shoulder. The decorative scheme is essentially the same in both cases - solid paint on the neck (on the inside of 40.11 as well, reserved on 207.25). The body is divided up by a group of bands below the handles, band(s) on the lower body and paint on, or immediately over the foot. Handles are painted and their attachments exaggeratedly emphasized with paint. In the shoulder zone are horizontal elongated 'S' patterns, close to those used to decorate flasks and neck-handled amphorae. SHOULDER-HANDLED AMPHORISKOS Represented by 40.2, height 8.2, diameter 7.2, proportion of diameter/height, 85%. It has a depressed globular profile, high ring foot, vertical handles mounted horizontally at the greatest diameter. The simple decorative scheme places solid paint on the rim and neck, repeated inside save a fine reserved band. Below the handle zone, in which is a design of hastily drawn parallel strokes, are three encircling bands. There is paint on the foot, leaving the foot 'lip' reserved. The handles are painted, but not completely. BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORISKOS The fragments 2.3 have been restored as this shape. If correct, the profile is ovoid, the neck flaring. There was solid paint on the rim outside, an elongated horizontal 'S' on the shoulder, while much of the body is taken up with a succession of broad and narrow bands. Handles and foot are lost. BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORAE The two examples, 112. 1 and F/67:5.i, are close in size (41 and 43 high, 33 and c. 34 diameter respectively) with a diameter/height proportion of c. 80%. Necks are high, concave and relatively slim. Bodies are broad ovoid, 11 2.1 with a lower centre of gravity than F/67:5.i. The upturned horizontal loop handles are attached just above the greatest diameter. Inside the mouths are deep zones of solid paint. The flat of 11 2.1 's rim is reserved apart from well spaced strokes of paint. F/67:5.i's neck is monochrome; 112. 1 has two fine reserved bands. The treatment of the upper body is unlike the decorative schemes of any other large SM vases discussed here, for shoulders are almost entirely covered by an arrangement of broad and fine bands; 11 2.1 has a fine wavy band in one of the reserved spaces. In the handle zone F/67:5.i has two broad horizontal wavy bands above an encircling band; 112. 1 has a single broad wavy band. Both have banded lower bodies. Bases are reserved - 11 2.1 is flat, F/67:5.i is a disc. NECK-HANDLED AMPHORISKOI A group of six fragmentary vases from T. 207 (io5 26, 28, 29, 46, 64) decorated with hand- drawn concentric semicircles suggests a phase very close to the end of SM when new ideas of shape and decoration were gaining currency in the traditional workshops. The largest (28) is 26.1 high, 16.4 in diameter, a diameter/height proportion of 62%. The smallest for which</page><page sequence="21">304 H- w- CATLING there are complete dimensions is 46 - 17.5, 12.0 and 68% respectively. The body outline is ovoid, with a relatively low, broad neck, vertical handle from rim to shoulder and a ring base. The decoration divides the vessel into so many zones with the use of bands, or groups of bands, though 28, 29, 46 and 64 have paint-coated lower bodies and feet. Where preserved, there is a band of paint inside the mouth. Handles are either reserved, striped or have a vertical wavy line. The most distinctive feature is the appearance of hand-drawn concentric semicircles in the shoulder-zone, often resting on the uppermost shoulder-band. 10 has four sets, 28 and 29 three. The number is uncertain on the fragmentary 26. On 46 there are four groups resting on two fine bands, with, below, the additional ornament of double zigzag lines, interspace cross-hatched. 64 is also elaborate, where the upper shoulder ornament is, again, cross-hatched zigzag lines, above a broad band from which depend three groups of concentric semicircles. HYDRIA There is one fragmentary example, F/67:5«2, its dimensions not recoverable, though its DR of 15 points to full size. The body was globular; the strap handle was attached below the lip. There are bands on rim, base of neck, shoulder and lower body. The horizontal wavy band in the handle zone recalls the decorative scheme of the belly-handled amphorae (supra), to which, of course, this shape is closely related. NECKED PITHOS This unusual SM shape, which was to have a long and distinguished later history, particularly as an ash container, is represented by 48.3, 5 and 6. They are very close to the SM-EPG threshold, with a close counterpart in F. tomb Theta.7 They vary in height from 39.0 to 33.3 cm, in diameter from 35.4 to 34. 3 and 5 have a girth slightly greater than their height (106% and 101% respectively). 6, at 87.5%, is a much slimmer version. The profiles, all a little different, are ovoid, 5 with a higher centre of gravity than 3, 6 different through its slimness. All have thickened, rounded lips, low necks, flat bases, with vertical loop handles mounted horizontally on the shoulders (6's handles are, relatively, much lower than the others). The ornamental schemes are similar, with reserved interiors, the rim-tops of 3 and 5 also reserved apart from groups of strokes of paint, with a broad band below. The whole of 6's rim is painted. The bottom of the handle zone is defined by a group of broad and fine bands; the lower bodies have either one broad (3 and 6) or several fine bands (5). 3 and 5 have a broad band of paint on the foot, 5 has fine bands above the painted foot. The handles are painted. The deep handle zone of 3 and 5 have panel designs based on a central triglyph edged by joining semicircles, or chevrons, flanked by cross-hatched lozenges (5), or rosette with wheel (3) or horizontal chevron groups (3). The even deeper handle zone of 6 merely has a horizontal scribbled wavy line, COARSE PITHOS Fragments (2.1) reconstructed to give a full section of a pithos are dated SM in the light of the two decorated vases from the tomb. It is 33.5 high, diameter 27.0 at the rim. The broad ovoid body is set off by a ridge from the flaring neck and rim. The base is flat. There is a vertical handle from rim to shoulder. 7 F. 16, no. 117, pl. 18.</page><page sequence="22">THE SUBMINOAN POTTERY 305 HANDMADE JUGLET The fragmentary state of 12 1.6 is regrettable, as it is the only example of its kind recognized on the site. The rather coarse fabric is not distinctive, apart from being reduced in firing. The panels of incised vertical lines and vertical strokes provide a specific character to the vase. Open Shapes TWO-HANDLED BOWL 98.9, on the SM-EPG threshold, is a hemispherical bowl, on a slightly raised base with concave underfoot, and two cocked-up handles of ultimately metallic form. The decoration is heavy, monochrome inside, the upper and middle body coated with a reserved band at the level of the handle attachment, picked out by a slim wavy band. There are fine bands below, and fine bands at the foot. CUP 1 Illustrated only by 40.19, which is 6.3X6.2, with deep bowl, and slightly flaring lip, standing on a relatively prominent cpne-foot, with vertical handle attached at the rim and lower body. There is an internal lip-band of paint and a second, lower interior band. The rim outside is reserved, and so is the foot. There is a band on the lower body, and a fairly tight zigzag scribble in the handle zone. cup 2 There are two fragmentary examples, 207.20, 21, of a form close to the SM/EPG division. Both are 7.2 cm high, but differ in diameter (c. 7.4 and c. 5.4). The bowl is globular, with everted rim, flat base with slightly concave underfoot, and vertical handle. The contour of the paint which partly covers the outside shows it was applied by dipping twice. Conclusions This is not the place for a general re-examination of Subminoan pottery. In the preceding pages I have described the characterizing features of seventeen decorated shapes which, by definition, I consider SM, although they include items found with PG vases. I have explained that, either because of their form or their decoration, they are of the SM, not the PG class. At the upper end of the scale, I have chosen to regard the establishment of the cemetery as the beginning of SM, accepting that the earliest vases on the site might, on intrinsic grounds, be classed as LM III C. While it is easy to argue that the T. 200 complex is probably the earliest on the site, and that T. 207 probably contains the latest SM vases, the evidence for arranging the rest of the material in relative sequence is not compelling. Examination of the horizontal stratigraphy of the cemetery is suggestive of certain groupings, but not sufficiently convincing to be a strong indicator on its own of the relative sequence of graves. On the other hand, F/67:i4«i, a stirrup jar of Group 4, is a considerable distance from this cluster. On the positive side, Ts. 45, 48 and 207, which are all largish chamber tombs more or less in a line in the N and SW quadrant of the cemetery, seem to form a group where the SM vases are both found with PG material, and themselves exhibit more developed characteristics than the obviously early SM vases. Between them, they account for all the stirrup jars of Group 5. If we are right about the primacy of T. 200, we might expect the pottery in the SM tombs in its immediate</page><page sequence="23">3o6 H. W. CATLING neighbourhood to show cognate qualities. Such a relationship is difficult to sustain in detail, though there is a link with its NE neighbour, T. 98, provided by the Group 1 stirrup jars in both tombs. Further afield, NE of 98, Ts. 40, 121, and 160, though disparate as tombs, are close-knit in their contents, having nearly all the Group 4 stirrup jars; they are within ten metres of each other. On the other hand, F/67H4.1, a stirrup jar of Group 4, is a considerable distance from this cluster. Equally, there is a separation of over 40 meters between Ts. 18 and 186, which should be linked through sharing stirrup jars of Group 2. A different kind of emphasis might be laid on the whereabouts of tombs without neck- handled amphorae. Four of the eight, 16, 112, 121, and 160 (perhaps all inhumations) form a fairly close group. Of the remainder, 2 and 186 are close to each other, as are F/67:5 and 14. Both pairs are separate from the larger group. Almost certainly, this distinction has nothing to do with chronology, for neck-handled amphorae occur throughout the SM use of the cemetery, starting with T. 200 and continuing to T. 207, perhaps the latest of the SM series. If T. 200 is the earliest tomb, with vases whose decoration (200.1, 3) perhaps looks back to LM III c, the group nevertheless cannot be very far removed in time from T. 112, for 200.2 and II2.2 are not only Group 2 stirrup jars, but have similar shoulder decoration. This in turn, takes us close to i86.i, (from a tomb whose rite is closest to T. 200). But, as we have seen, 186 takes 18 with it (presence of Group 3 stirrup jars). We may therefore tentatively attribute these tombs and their contents to Phase One in the cemetery's use, viz: T. 200-202 (Three stirrup jars, neck-handled amphora) T. 112 (Two stirrup jars, belly-handled amphora) T. 186 (Stirrup jar) T. 18 (Two stirrup jars, neck-handled amphora) Probably very close to this grouping, because of its Group 1 stirrup jar link with T. 200 is: T. 98 (Stirrup jar, two neck-handled amphorae, a two-handled bowl) Perhaps also here, because of the belly-handled amphora link with T. 112, might be placed: T. F/67:5 (Belly-handled amphora, hydria) Phase Two is represented by group 4 stirrup jars (distinguished from Phase One jars by smaller size and simpler ornament), flasks and a wider selection of small vases. Neck-handled amphorae continue. The phase comprises: T. 40 (Four stirrup jars, three flasks, a small oinochoe, a shoulder-handled amphora, a shoulder-handled amphoriskos, a cup) T. 121 (Two stirrup jars, two flasks, a small oinochoe, a thelastron, a handmade vase) T. 160 (A stirrup jar) T. F/67:i4 (A stirrup jar) and perhaps: T. 24 (Stirrup jar, two neck-handled amphorae)</page><page sequence="24">THE SUBMINOAN POTTERY 307 Phases Three comprises the graves that overlap with PG, namely: T. 45 (Two stirrup jars, neck-handled amphora) T. 48 (Two stirrup jars, three neck-handled amphorae, three necked pithoi) T. 207 (Stirrup jar, four neck-handled amphorae, six neck-handled amphoriskoi, two cups) Four tombs - 2, 16, 56 and 208 - cannot be accommodated in these phases. Ts. 56 and 208 each contain merely a neck-handled amphora and could, theoretically, belong to any of the three phases. Ts. 2 and 16 contain stirrup jars which stand apart from the rest of the material. They are unlikely to be much later than Phase One. To speak of a continuous development in SM pottery as illustrated by the N Cemetery tombs is to be over-optimistic. There is clearly a gap between Phases One and Two during which new shapes appeared, the size of stirrup jars diminished, their shape altered (see analysis by groups, supra) and shoulder ornament was simplified. In Phase Three, there is another obvious jump forward, without much clue to the processes whereby it took place. New shapes appeared (some of them part of the development which brought PG to Crete), old shapes were changed, seen in the slimmer stirrup jars which comprise Group 5, with their minimal decoration. There seems little doubt that the neck-handled amphora persisted, very largely unchanged, throughout the three phases. It was the only shape to do so. Unsurprisingly, our material is perfectly at home in its Knossian milieu. Desborough8 has usefully collected references to what was previously known and published, notably the SM groups from the Gypsades cemetery, the Fortetsa and Ayios Ioannis tombs, and the Spring Chamber group at the Caravanserai. To these may be added J. N. Coldstream's 'Knossos 1951-61: PG and G pottery from the Town',9 where a small amount of SM and SM-EPG material is described. More recent contributions include M. R. Popham's account of the SM settlement material from the Unexplored Mansion, and P. M. Warren's preliminary description of SM material from occupation deposits in the Stratigraphie Museum Extension site.10 Of particular interest are the Gypsades groups Via and VII. Tomb VII11 contained at least three burials, one in a larnax, and may have been in use for some time, so its contents are not necessarily closely contemporary. It contained six stirrup jars, two belly-handled amphorae, a small oinochoe, a spouted cup, and a small pyxis. There is some variety in the shoulder decoration of the stirrup jars, from the curvilinear Fringed Style of VII.8, to the straight-sided angle-hatched triangles of VII.7. The majority of the stirrup jars are small. It is tempting to see this group as partly spanning the gap between Phases One and Two, illustrating the development that must have taken place between those two phases. The four fragmentary vases from Via (a largely destroyed tomb) included two stirrup jars, a flask, and a neck- handled amphora with curvilinear ornament on the shoulder. The size of the stirrup jars and the form of the triangles with which their shoulders are decorated relates this group closely to Phase Two. Notable is a tomb at Ayios Ioannis12 excavated in 1959, probably opened and used in LM II, 8 GDA 373. 9 BSA 67 (1972), 63-98. 10 UM II, 59-66 (Fopham); AR 29 (1983), 76-87 (Warren). 11 BSA 53-54 (Ï958-59)» 205-8, 247-9, figs. 27-9, pls. 55-7. ■* BSA 63 (1968), 205-18.</page><page sequence="25">3o8 H. W. CATLING thereafter thoroughly robbed before its reuse for a double inhumation burial accompanied by two stirrup jars (one - B.2 - height 24.5, the other - B.3 - height 16.0) and a belly-handled amphora decorated with wavy bands recalling our 112. 1 and 24.4, both in size and decoration. Particular interest attached to the bronze pins found in situ on the shoulders of one of the skeletons. Though there are differences, this group best fits into Phase One, though not with its earliest elements. The graves at Ayios Ioannis dug in part by R. W. Hutchinson and in part by T. J. Dunbabin, subsequently published by J. Boardman as Trotogeometric Graves at Ayios Ioannis at Knossos'13 illustrate the ambivalence of our Phase Three, with which some of the Ayios Ioannis material must be contemporary. Tomb IV, indeed, (stirrup jar, neck-handled amphora, two thelastra, a skyphos, a shoulder-handled amphoriskos) should be earlier than our Phase Three (albeit Boardman tentatively suggests a MPG date), perhaps transitional between Phases Two and Three. The tomb itself seems probably to have been a pit-cave, but used rather differently to the fashion in which our Ts. 186 and 200 were employed. Ayios Ioannis T. VIII is a good match for our Phase Three (four stirrup jars, two neck-handled amphorae, a belly-handled amphora, a hydria, a skyphos, a thelastron, a tray, and four cups. Two other neck-handled amphorae were associated, but in rather uncertain fashion). Individual pieces were dated by Boardman 'SM-EPG' ( a stirrup jar), 'EPG' (two stirrup jars, belly-handled amphora, tray, a cup), 'E-MPG' (a stirrup jar, thelastron). The rest are 'MPG' or C?MPG' The complex is supposed to consist of swept-up burials/cremations placed in a side-chamber in readiness for the reuse of a main chamber destroyed before the excavation took place. The group must represent an extended period of use, starting not long after Phase Two and continuing beyond Phase Three. Considered from the SM perspective, a chamber tomb near Isopata,14 excavated in 1958, could be allocated to Phase Three - there is a neck-handled amphora and a stirrup jar. But the ambivalence of this material is well illustrated by Coldstream's original date of MPG for the group. From his perspective, the shape of the stirrup jar, its sparse decoration and straight triangles stamped it as MPG. The EPG tomb at Teke,15 published at the same time, contained a stirrup jar (no. 5) akin to our Group 5, suggesting that the tomb partly overlapped Phase Three, though doubtless outlasting it. Of the Fortetsa tombs excavated by Payne and Blakeway, and published by Brock,16 Tomb Pi was classed by Brock as SM. He suggested that it had been looted of its larger vases, supposing them to have contained cremations and to have occupied a vacant space in the tomb floor. But this need not have happened; the tomb may have contained inhumations, all trace of which had gone (as we suppose was the case with the SM use of our T. 40). The contents of T. Pi suggest that it was used more than once, with an interval between use; it has a stirrup jar (no. 9) which by size and decoration17 belongs with Phase One, two others (nos. 13 and 15) which would be at home in Phase Two, together with two cups (nos. 10 and 16) which go very closely with the cup in T. 40. There are several shapes (kalathoi, ajar with false spout, and a slim jar) unrepresented in the N Cemetery. Tomb Pi has no certain Phase Three element. Fortetsa T.

A rather tenuous link with Phase Two is the shoulder ornament of F. no. 137, a stirrup jar, paralleled on the shoulder of the neck-handled amphora of Phase Two T. 40.16. More convincing is the link between F. no. 40, a stirrup jar, and our 45.7, a stirrup jar whose shoulder ornaments of dot- filled lozenges set off by a background of quite finely drawn hatching are so close in design and execution even to suggest the same workshop, if not the same hand. That would be a convincing Phase Three synchronism. The material from the Knossos Spring Chamber18 has obvious links with Phase Two, notably for the shoulder-handled amphoriskoi decorated with parallel vertical strokes, and a cup with similar ornament, both of which point to our T. 40. The Spring Chamber stirrup jar would be quite at home in Phase Two. The material at the Stratigraphie Museum Extension site identified as SM by P. M. Warren offers support to this assessment of what may legitimately be classed as SM. For instance, our T. 40 is linked by its cup to Warren's SM pit.19 Elsewhere, Warren has found a shoulder- handled amphoriskos close to 40.2.20 From another SM pit came a fragmentary bell skyphos21 whose panel ornament of central triglyph and flanking wheel-design is very close to the ornament of our necked pithos 48.3. A kalathos fragment from an adjacent pit was also decorated with a central triglyph edged by joining semicircles, characteristic of two of three T. 48 necked pithoi.

CATLING period, of which considerable note has already been taken, particularly by Desborough.22 This concerns the exceptional stirrup jar 200.3, which stands apart from all other stirrup jars we have considered, not only from the N Cemetery, but from the whole Knossos area. It is conspicuous for the net of cross-hatched lozenges alternating with reserved lozenges enclosing dot-and-circle, and for the use of solid paint to cover the lower part of the body. Both features are known in Cyprus, where one or two horizontal bands of linked cross-hatched lozenges occur on several large PWP stirrup jars of Late Cypriot III B, conventionally dated to the first half of the eleventh century BC. These include ajar from Kaloriziki,23 two from Gastria-J/ß&amp;y, together with another three in private collections which very probably came from Alaas^ and another from an unpublished tomb at Kouklia-SA^ky.25 The same use of cross-hatched lozenges is found on several other PWP shapes, including pyxides, an amphoriskos, a tripod and a zoomorphic vase.26 Equally, there are several instances of the use of solid paint on the lower bodies of PWP stirrup jars, including six examples from Gastria-i4/ß&amp;y, or very probably from that site.27 It is probable there is a connection between 200.3 and Cyprus; it may not be accident that it is associated with the tomb containing the fragmentary four-sided bronze stand, whose Cypriot origin seems very probable.28 22 GDA 1 18-19. 23 Pieridou, PGRK, pl. 17.2. 2* Alaos, pl. 55, T. 15.10; pl. 63, T. 19.13; pl. 69, B5, B8 and Bio; pl. 70, B9 (all Hadjiprodromou Collection).

N. COLDSTREAM THE PITHOS In discussing the pottery from a cemetery largely of cremations, it is natural to begin with the pithoi, which served as urns. Those with painted decoration display the Knossian G style on the largest scale, and form the basis of our internal relative chronology. Within the standard ovoid series, the G neckless type with two or four handles takes over gradually from a PG predecessor with low neck, and two handles either vertical or horizontal. Spanning the transition is a third, straight-sided, form current only in PGB and EG. All three types have closely related counterparts in coarse or plain wares, best considered under this general heading. Corresponding to the G ovoid type are a few experiments in incised bucchero, all MG. Coarse versions of the straight-sided pithos are in red micaceous fabric. For the PG ovoid variety with neck, the coarse counterparts are in gritty orange clay, usually coated in a light slip. Coarse necked pithoi with vertical handles contained some of the earliest cremations at Knossos; with these we shall begin. The Necked Pithos a. with vertical handles (i) Coarse PG. Broad low neck; strap handles to rim or just below; globular or plump ovoid body, with groups of incised lines. E-MPG: J 2 fr., O 6, 285.3 and 59 firs., 285.58. LPG-PGB: 28.5, 287.9, 175.23, 0,57. A fragmentary SM prototype, 2.1, has a depressed globular body with no sign of incised decoration, resting on a flat and relatively broad base. J 2, no less squat, introduces what appear to be two innovations of PG: a heavy disc foot (for the larger vessels), and a group of incised lines on the shoulder. On subsequent members of the E-MPG group the lines may be repeated on the belly and lower body, while the shape progresses towards plump ovoid. F no. 242, from a MPG context, belongs here. In the later PG group the potters make a more consistent effort to reinforce the rim, tentatively at first (28.5), but eventually achieving a crisp, squared profile in 175.23 and Q, 57. The latter vessel, and its companion F. no. 1002, look forward to the next class; the height is already more than 50 cm, and the handles have begun to retreat below the rim. A universal feature of this PG type is the slight ridge where the neck joins the body.</page><page sequence="29">3i2 J. N. COLDSTREAM (ii) Coarse LPG-LG. Broad neck, growing taller; ovoid body, becoming slimmer. Handle to neck; squared lip. LPG-PGB: 285.61 PGB-EG: 18.8; Q,3, 58, 59, frs. EG: 280.1; 104. 1 frs. LG: 78.1. As the size grows, proportions change. The necks of 285.61 and 18.8 are already high enough for the handles to be comfortably attached below the lip. These are the latest coarse pithoi to serve as cremation urns. Thereafter 280.1 (78.5 cm) and 78.1 (more than 85 cm) were used for infant inhumations. Their slimmer ovoid bodies and taller necks begin to recall the painted neck-handled amphorae, except that their necks are much broader, and their handles diminutive in relation to their vast size. Similar pithoi have been found in the settlement of Phaistos;29 in our cemetery, the same type continues into EO (98.2). (iii) PG-EG, painted. Strap handles on shoulder. LPG: 28.9. PGB: 13.16, L 9 fr. EG: M 19, 285.71, Q 85 fr. These differ from the coarse PG pithoi in that both handle attachments spring from the shoulder, and the neck is narrower; but the painted versions do not settle down to any consistent development of shape. The earliest, F. no. 244, is perhaps MPG; concentric circles have already become the canonical decoration - and virtually the only decoration found on this class in the F. series. Our first two pithoi, however, also have rectilinear motifs in the centre. The elaborate composition on 28.9, where the innermost circle-sets are hitched to the centre by wavy tangents (cf. the bell-krater F. no. 712) recall the antithetic spirals of LM III C. On 13.16, an unusually well-proportioned piece, the circles are loosely bound together by an hourglass, a favourite motif of PGB. M 19 is conservative, lacking the usual ring foot and decorated with circles only; L 9 is very similar. The latest feature of this pair is the handle design with diagonal crosses between bars, which takes over from the earlier S motif (e.g. 28.9) from PGB onwards; and in tomb M no other vessel is obviously earlier than EG. Our most advanced pieces, 285.71 and Q, 85, combine EG cables with a dark ground. After EG this type is seen no more, apart from a single LG example, F. no. 593. B.

Earliest, perhaps, are the clumsily-made and extremely plump pair Mastamba nos. 69 and 77. Thereafter the body shape changes from stout (13.19) to slender. Our latest examples are close to F. no. 391, from a wholly EG tomb group. The shape continues elsewhere into LG, assuming a more elegant ovoid form; see Mastamba nos. 46, 55 and 58, and Atsalenio A 21. (ii) PG-EG, painted; single-arc handles. Short concave neck, flat base; light ground. SM/EPG: 48.6, 48.5, 48.3. E-MPG: J 63. EG: M 16 fr., 286.3, 129.5 &amp;•&gt; G I2? 229.18, O 4. The three pithoi from tomb 48 are the earliest known examples of this class, going back to a transitional SM/EPG stage preceding the introduction of concentric circles on this shape. Their decoration consists of a wavy line in the SM tradition (48.6), and fringed central lines flanked on 48.5 by concave cross-hatched lozenges, and on 48.3 by quite different motifs on each side - perhaps the earliest vessel to present an intentional contrast between the decoration of its two faces. On one side, groups of sigmas are connected and intersected by a continuous line, as though to render a horizontal version of the schematic 'tree5 seen on some contemporary bell-kraters (e.g. 285.60). On the other, a single fringed circle encloses a solid Maltese cross, no doubt borrowed from Attic PG imports like 207.7. The same motif recurs, fringeless, on J 63, whose unusually narrow base with ring foot relates it closely to contemporary bell-kraters. Somewhere within this early group, perhaps between the T. 48 trio and J 63, lies F. no. 117 from a wholly EPG tomb, where the decoration combines fringed central lines with the earliest appearance on this shape of concentric circles. Once established, the concentric circles for a time exclude all other ornament. There follows a carefully made pair with slightly higher and narrower neck, everted rim, medium ovoid body and a pronounced disc foot, F. nos. 206 and 282, dated by context respectively to MPG and LPG. After an interval, our series ends with several less careful pieces with sagging bodies and, once again, flat bases. 286.3 and G 12 share a straight oblique neck, similar in general proportions to F. nos. 387 and 392 from an EG tomb group; the standing semicircles on the belly of G 12 look especially maladroit. Thereafter, circular decoration is superseded by two wavy lines on 229.18 (cf. F. no. 347) or, on O 4, Atticizing rectilinear decoration which must be contemporary with the earliest neckless pithoi. Virtually forgotten during the remainder of the G sequence, this class was to enjoy a vigorous revival in EO. 292.41, with two horizontal and two vertical handles, is a harbinger of this revival, decorated like neckless pithoi late in LG (type C(i)). (iii) PG-EG painted, with bucranium handles. Disc foot, everted lip. LPG: O 37, 147.1 fr. EG: 306.26, 306.25. For slightly larger pithoi, 40 cm or more high, double handles were prudently supplied. Earliest is F. no. 222 from the MPG tomb V, very squat, resembling a large pyxis with sharply everted lip and disc foot. O 37 is a taller and more ovoid version, its body profile intermediate</page><page sequence="31">3i4 J- N. COLDSTREAM between the elegant pair F. nos. 208 and 282 of class B (ii). Next come two PGB pithoi, similar in shape but very differently decorated: F. no. 1029 where traditional circles flank a crowded central rectilinear panel; and Gypsades no. 1 with a bold and early Atticizing scheme based on a large central meander. Below, on both, the PG light ground has given place to continuous thick bands - and eventually, on the EG pair from T. 306, to Atticizing dark-ground bands and lines. These last two pithoi share the sagging body profile of their B (ii) contemporaries, and their decoration is in a state of ferment typical of the time: crowded circles on 306.26, flanking central columns which include cables; on 306.25, horizontal strips of clumsily hatched zigzags and intersecting wavy lines. Apart from F. no. 1424, an unusual MG pithos on a tall ribbed pedestal, this class has no future; but, as we shall see, it must have played some part in the genesis of the neckless ovoid G pithos. The Straight-sided Pithos Low vertical lip, straight shoulder with pronounced carination, two rising horizontal handles on the shoulder, flat base. Decoration and contexts in the N Cemetery confirm Brock's conclusion that this shape is 'practically confined to the PGB and EG periods' at Knossos.30 No feature of the earlier PG pithoi prepares us for its sudden introduction. To be sure, it has a small relative in the straight- sided pyxis, made in Crete from LM III B into PG. Nevertheless it will be argued in our Epilogue that the arrival in PGB of the straight-sided pithos as a cremation urn is but one of several symptoms at this time of a revival of interest in ancestral Minoan customs and art- forms. Here the re-used MM I pithos 132.9, with differently disposed handles but a very similar body shape, provides food for thought. A more important consideration, however, is that some exceptionally large 'pyxides' of LM III C had already served as urns for some of the earliest cremations in Crete.31 (i) Coarse PGB: 283.52, 285.7. PGB-EG: G 49 (double, miniature). The fabric is deep red, gritty, and very micaceous; 285.7 is exceptionally heavy, and its surface well smoothed. Each of the full-size pithoi has a lid preserved, made in the same fabric and specially designed to fit over the low lip. Traces of white decoration survive on all three vessels; for the circles of 283.52 and the spaced banding of 285.7 compare respectively F. nos. 343 and 345, both from the PGB tomb OD. G 49 has a counterpart in Fortetsa tomb A;32 they suggest the revival of a Minoan idea, since double vases are alien to PG and G tradition. 30 F. 147. The coarse pithos 285.7, among its smashed fragments, contained part of an Attic LPG skyphos (285.152) which might suggest an EPG date; but it was clearly not in situ, and the neighbouring small vessels were LPG and PGB. 31 E.g.

EG: 107.178, N 9, 175.37, 75.110, G 6, 134.74 fr., 175.63 fr. These pithoi inaugurate a long period when the painted pithos-urn was the leading shape in the Knossian repertoire, equipped with a matching lid in the same style. They display on the largest scale the proto-orientalizing aspects of the PGB phase and its EG sequel. At no time were they the only available painted urns; but their unusually rich decoration argues high status, and indeed the tombs which produced them also yielded metal offerings appropriate to families high up in the social hierarchy. To determine their relative order within the PGB-EG sequence is an important but difficult task. Often they are among the oldest urns in tombs used by many subsequent generations; thus, even in unplundered tombs like T. 75, upheavals caused by later burials have shattered them and dispersed whatever offerings they may have housed. Contexts, then, are of little help - apart from vague clues afforded by the chronological brackets of the entire corpus of pottery within each tomb. There remains the internal evidence of style, especially the correlation between gradual changes in shape and ornament; in general, the usual progression from stout to slender shape is paralleled by a growth in size, and by a change from a PG free field on a light ground to G horizontal zoning with ever-increasing areas of dark ground. We begin with D 12, relatively small (H. 28.5 cm), very plump, and nearest in shape to the LM III C pyxis-urns. The proportions are like F. no. 350, but the inset lip (which the lid D 21 will fit) anticipates the G ovoid type; the idea could have been taken from imported Attic MG I pyxides like 283.46. In the decoration, new motifs are injected into the old PG scheme of circles flanking a rectilinear panel: the circles, reduced to two per set, enclose large rosettes recalling oriental jewellery;33 the central panel is now occupied by a rectilinear cable34 on one side, and on the other by a hatched meander of Attic origin. Atticizing G motifs rarely occur on this class, and never play more than a subordinate part in their decoration; but we must be prepared for their occasional appearance in the wake of a steady flow of Attic MG I imports. Then follow three remarkable pithoi with pictorial decoration, united by the common theme of the spirati tree, and probably painted all three by the same hand. 283.11 follows the plump proportions of D 12 on a much larger scale, large enough to need massive double-reeded handles for security. Its strange applied ribbing, a unique experiment perhaps based on the small quasi-bucchero vessels made under Cypriot influence (Oinochoe, type E), dictates a vertical axis to the decoration in harmony with this Tree Painter's favourite theme, and also with the much taller shape of his two subsequent pithoi. In our search for possible lids, we note how the minimal necks of 283.11 and 292.144 eventually give place to the inset lip of 107.114. The only suitable lids have a plain conical profile with ornamental knobs, their rims overlapping some way on to the shoulder. The huge rosette on 283.31 echoes the vertical emphasis of the body decoration, while the horizontal zoning of 292.61 provides a lively contrast. For 107.114 the most likely candidate is 107.126, showing traces of an attachment in the form of a bird. The iconography of the Tree Painter's three pithoi, culminating in the two pictures of a 33 Cf. K. R.

COLDSTREAM nature goddess with trees and birds on 107.114, has been examined in a previous article.35 There it was argued that the two sides of 107.114 portray a deliberate contrast of seasons, showing the goddess arriving in spring and departing at the onset of winter - an appropriate theme for a cremation urn, recalling the alternation between birth, death, and rebirth. LM III pictorial larnakes, visible when older chamber tombs were reopened and re-used, were suggested as a possible source for this painter's imagery; indeed, the goddess, the bird and the spiral tree all figure on the larnax 107.214 (FIGS. 1 14-16). That the goddess's wheeled platform represents a chariot is confirmed by a LM III B larnax from Kavrochori on which36 a latticed box is attached to a very similar 'skateboard'. Here we are more concerned with the Tree Painter's style and his place in Knossian vase- painting. The spiral tree and its simplified derivatives recur as abstract motifs in contemporary work (oinochoe G 21, lids 13.17, 218.135), perhaps within his own workshop. Of his two kinds of bird, neither is new. The curious triangular creatures on the trees of 107.114 have a clumsy predecessor on the stirrup-jar 207.3, but no future. The gracefully rounded birds of 283.11 and 292.144 betray a LM III C ancestry,37 recalling also the figured LPG krater E 3; the more elaborate version, with various body fillings and long sinuous neck hatched in double outline, is reduced to single outline in the hands of the goddess, with dotted eye floating in the field. Provincial adaptations of this painter's work can be seen on pithoi of the same shape at Prinias,38 where birds and trees sprawl chaotically over the surface, but without the goddess; another Prinias fragment, showing a commanding male figure under the handle of a similar pithos,39 might well be a Knossian import in our painter's tradition. The goddess of 107.114, occupying almost the full height of a tall panel, is by far the largest human figure in Geometric vase-painting. Closely related are the ladies under the handles of F. no. 1440, perhaps a slightly earlier experiment by the same hand; common to both portrayals are the long hatched neck, the outline face with a dotted circle for the eye, the eyebrow, the open mouth, and the absence of a nose. But whereas the figures of F. no. 1440 look back to the Minoan snake deity, our goddess displays some Near Eastern features: the wings belong more to Syrian tradition than to Minoan or Mycenaean,40 and perhaps also the tall polos; and the rendering of the hair shows some knowledge of the oriental 'layer wig', long before its adoption by vase painters at the outset of the conventional Orientalizing movement. Her garments, however, have a homespun look. The long rectangular dress, with the suggestion of a shawl over the shoulders, sets the fashion for all draped women in Cretan art down to the seventh century. The dress patterns make her a walking illustration of the PGB abstract repertoire: mill-sail, ladder pattern, and check pattern of gridded squares. Although the Tree Painter's manner is echoed in the trees of 107.178 and the birds of 134.74, EG pithoi of this class show much less invention in their decoration. The general tendency now is towards horizontal zoning, first seen on F. no. 1440; and on the lower body there is an increasing encroachment of dark-ground bands and lines in the Attic MG manner (e.g. N 9). Single motifs are sometimes allowed to fill vast areas of the surface, as on G 6, 175.37, and also F. no. 197 and Hartley no. 10; or, as on 75.110 and F. no. 706, the same 35 Coldstream, BICS 31 (1984) 93 ff., on 283.11 and 107. 114; for 292.144 see id., Reflexions 26, fig. 2.1; Urns with Lids 112, fig. 5. 36 A.

In the shape, apart from the attenuation of the base, a significant innovation is the conversion of the low neck into an inset lip rising only slightly above the shoulder (75.110, 107.178, 175.37), under the influence of the new ovoid neckless type which was now becoming established as the most usual form of urn. Straight-sided pithoi continue through G in other parts of Crete;41 at Knossos, apart from a rare revival in EO (O pithos type E), they vanish from the repertoire after EG. The Ovoid Neckless Pithos a. early experiments PGB-EG, closely Atticizing: G 10, G no, 13.12. EG, early local adaptations: G 8, G 11, 107.125, 292.150 fr., 100.43 fr- EG, with slight collar: G 13, G 84 fr., 104. 119 fr., 283.14, 283.23, O 15, 218.50. The debut of the ovoid pithos coincides with a general movement towards Atticizing shapes and rectilinear G ornament, under the influence of Attic MG imports. The Attic version,42 though never the preferred form of urn in Attica, is nevertheless represented at Knossos by F. no. 454. The earliest Knossian examples include three very close imitations of this prototype, made when the exuberant PGB-EG style was still in full vigour; this we infer from the general contexts of tombs G, 13 and 100. Every detail of the Attic model is here reproduced: in the shape, the flat inset lip, the taut ovoid body, the well-articulated ring foot, and the doubled loop handles rising almost vertically; in the decoration, the severe dark-ground scheme with a reserved rectilinear panel at handle level, sometimes a narrow zone under the handles (13.12), and sets of three reserved lines to break up the large area of solid paint below. It is likely that the workshop of these pithoi also produced equally close copies of other Attic shapes such as were current at this time.43 The conversion to the ovoid pithos was not, however, a tidy process. For a time it coexisted with both earlier types and, as we have seen, influenced both in different ways: witness the Atticizing rectilinear decoration of some EG necked pithoi (O 4, Gypsades no. 1) and, on the latest straight-sided pithoi, the transformation of the low neck into a rising inset lip. Conversely the older types had some effect in shaping the early development of the ovoid pithoi. Among the very earliest, still PGB, are F. no. 691 and Gypsades no. 86, which combine an inset lip with the circular PG ornament traditional to the necked pithoi; the new shape, so it seems, arrived before the new decoration. Next, in EG, come the huge G 8 (H. 62 cm) and the small G 11, both of which combine old and new elements in their decoration and, like the contemporary belly-handled amphorae, vary the designs on the two sides of the vase. G 11, like the amphora G 5, is 'bilingual' between PG circles and a G meander scheme. On G 8, meander and zigzags are absorbed into vast and florid compositions with motifs borrowed from the PGB repertoire of straight-sided pithoi; other large vessels from this tomb, such as the oinochoe G 15 and the krater G 80, were made in the same workshop. When the decoration is wholly Atticizing, meanders are drawn with a thick brush and a heavy hand, as 41 GGP255 f., pl. 56a, c-d; 259, pl. 56e. 42 GGP23 n.5, 'globular pyxis'. 43 E.g. oinochoai 283.30, 292.63; skyphoi G 40, 125.</page><page sequence="35">3i8 J. N. COLDSTREAM on E nos. 770 and 779. The ancillary chain of dotted lozenges on 100.43, a motif not seen in Attic before MG II,44 confirms that Knossian EG spans the transition between the two phases of Attic MG.45 Another group looks back to the necked pithos in retaining a slight collar, usually in addition to the inset lip, sometimes in lieu of a lip (G 13), and on 283.14 awkwardly combined with a minimal inner flange to take the lid; as often in EG, the decoration of this last vessel mixes the meander with local curvilinear motifs. No less experimental are the handles. As alternatives to the rising loops of the Attic prototypes we find horizontal straps (G 13), bucrania (107.125) as on the larger necked pithoi and, with the addition of two vertical straps on O 15, one of the first appearances of the four-handled form which was to become normal in the next phase. B. THE MG OVOID PITHOS Having displaced both older types of urn, the ovoid pithos now settles down to a standard form with thick walls, a slightly rising concave lip, a plump body with a lower centre of gravity than the Attic model, a massive ring foot, and a height of around 40 cm. To lift these heavy vessels four handles are usually provided: two bucrania (sometimes with stirrups to the rim) and two vertical straps. The decoration, applied in thick and often quite lustrous paint, is dark-ground and predominantly Atticizing, though often covering more of the surface than on contemporary large vessels in Attic. Handles are normally barred, sometimes with small motifs barred off in panels; spaces under the bucrania are often fully painted. Standardization makes it possible to discern two distinct workshops, which will be described before the general run of MG pithoi. (i) The MG Horse workshop «5-3» «3«-3» O *4 fr., 0, 7« fr-&gt; «8-395 129.1, 60.7, 75.223 fr., 292.45, 292.149, 283.12, 132.4, 218.23, 75.38, 125.7. The output of this prolific workshop includes the six MG pithoi of Brock's 'first group',46 Teke tholos no. 11, Atsalenio B 6, Gypsades nos. 58-9, and what seems like a Knossian export to Arkades.47 The workshop is named after the horses on 125.3 and the Atsalenio pithos, the only two MG vessels bearing representations of animals. These pithoi are heavy and robust, developing in shape from globular-conical to plump ovoid. There are always four handles - pairs of bucrania and vertical straps. Decoration covers the upper half. Panels between the handles are subdivided into two or more horizontal strips, the motifs often being varied from side to side. A long panel, or a continuous zone, is placed below the handles; very rarely, where space permits (218.39; F. no. 452), there may be a narrow strip above. As usual in large Atticizing schemes, the hatched meander dominates, supported by zigzags, cross-hatched lozenges and dotted lozenges as the most common ancillaries. Local invention, however, is not wholly stifled. Leaves (125.7) and simplified tongues (O 14, Q, 72, 218.23) survive from the PGB curvilinear repertoire, and the rectilinear improvisations of this workshop include hatched diagonal crosses (132.2), the " GGP 2±n. 3. «GGP 241. 46 F. 148, nos. 426, 837, 596, 608, 530, 452. 47 Arkades 433 fig. 580.</page><page sequence="36">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 3Ig 'tartan' pattern of Gypsades no. 59, and the elaborated meanders of 283.12. The bucranium handles are always barred, with solid paint below; on the vertical straps, bars may alternate with chevrons (218.23), or enclose small panels containing stars (132.4, 283.12) or tongues (21839) The two figured pithoi, certainly by the same hand, show horses in rapid movement, painted in a rough but lively style quite unlike any Attic counterparts. On both vases there is a suggestion of pars pro toto; a chariot is implied by the doubling of the horses in two of the four panels of Atsalenio B 6, and more explicitly by the reins leading out of the picture in the only figured panel of 125.3. There the horse is accompanied by a hound in pursuit of a large bird, a theme which might well have been inspired by a larnax scene.48 The lid for this pithos, 125.4, carries a frieze of silhouette birds with long legs, and long neck meeting the head at a sharp angle. These birds recur in vertical columns, each perched on its neighbour's back, on the strap handles of 60.7, 75.223, 292.45 and 292.149, and on the handles of the amphora 292.160 which must also have been painted in this workshop. These creatures bear some resemblance to the 'kangaroo' birds of PGB,49 and provide our first view of any standardized type current in Knossian MG. (ii) The MG Stirrup workshop Four-handled: 175*39, 75*1659 218.9 fr., 292.114, 75.109. Two-handled: 75*42, 107.110, 292.64, 218.43. These pithoi correspond to Brock's second and third MG groups, and help to bridge the very minor differences between them.50 Common to all is the flattened stirrup linking each bucranium handle to the rim, sometimes flanked by slight bosses on the rim suggestive of metal (e.g. 74.42). The idea for such handles was probably supplied by Atticizing pedestalled kraters like 75.117 which, to judge from its decoration (cf. 107.110) may also come from this workshop. When a pair of vertical strap handles is added, they are always decorated with diagonal crosses and bars; the stirrups are treated in the same way, with bars on the bucrania below. Earliest are the four-handled pithoi 175.39 and 75.165 whose interior spatter harks back to local PG tradition, while the thick brushwork of 175.39 recalls EG. This pair introduces the workshop's normal syntax for four-handled pithoi: horizontal strips of equal depth above and below the handle panels, and slight variations from side to side. Meanders and bulky cross- hatched lozenges are the leading motifs; also favoured are arcaded tongues (292.114, F. nos. 423, 444), billets (75.42, 75.165) and lozenges dotted and quartered (F. nos. 423, 440, 1391); the last two recur on the amphora 292.57, perhaps another product of this workshop. The two-handled pithoi are more restrained in their decoration, allowing no ornament below the handles; this restraint, and the thinner meander of 75.42, imply a later stage of MG. (iii) Other MG painted pithoi MG, early: four-handled, 1.11 fr.; two-handled, 104.26 fr., 24.5 fr., 175.40, 306.14, N 23 fr. 48 Cf. AAA (1971) 217 fig. 4.

MG, late: four-handled, 107.118 fr., 75.121, 75.62, 218.128, 218.37, 132.5, 107.64, 283.16 fr.; three-handled, 175.41, 292.145; two-handled, 106.25 fr-&gt; 285.39; handles uncertain, 294.35 fr. 104.26 and 24.5 stand unusually close to the Attic prototype; the dogtooth of the former is an Attic ancillary motif not often found in Cretan MG. Poor relations of the Stirrup workshop, or perhaps early experiments, may be seen in 175.40 and 306.14. F 6 is by the painter of F. no. 693, who preserves the PGB cable and favours extreme variety between handle panels, some of which are vertically divided.51 Later MG pithoi foreshadow one or more features characteristic of LG. First, the thinning- out of the meander, a process well illustrated by 107.118, 75.121, 75.62 and 218.128, a quartet forming a close group. Secondly, the return to single horizontal and fully painted handles in preference to barred bucrania - as on the two three-handled pithoi (a still-born experiment) and on 218.37, but there the decoration of the straps - including a meander passing straight across their roots - tells us that we are still in MG (whereas the lines down the straps of 132.5 anticipate a later LG practice). Third, the avoidance of any ornament below the handle zone, even on four-handled pithoi like 218.128 and 107.64 which also illustrates a fourth and most predictable development: the attenuation of the shape to a slim ovoid. The barrel shape of 285.39, coupled with its flattened and vertically rising handles, looks extremely old-fashioned, reviving the memory of the straight-sided pithos; but its decoration, as we shall see, places it in an advanced stage of MG. A fifth late MG feature is the occasional intrusion of square metopal panels, filled with quatrefoil (218.37) or swastika (285.39). These two motifs appear only rarely in Knossian LG, but are fully at home in the metopal compositions of Attic LG I. They indicate some renewed contact - if only transient - with the Attic style, from which we learn that Knossian MG, though largely contemporary with Attic MG II, overlaps slightly into the period of Attic LG 1.52 (iv) MG bucchero pithoi 75.81, 283.22. This pair, with F. no. 415, represent a rare and short-lived alternative to the painted pithos in MG times. These bucchero pithoi may well have been made in the Horse workshop, with which they correspond exactly in shape. Contemporary with them are a few broad-based Atticizing oinochoai in the same technique (Oinochoe C(ii)); but they have no LG successors. C. THE LG OVOID PITHOS At the risk of over-simplification, LG painted pithoi will be presented under two broad categories. First, the more conventional pithoi defined and listed as LG by Brock, usually somewhat slimmer than in MG. Their decoration, 'more formally geometric than before',53 is 51 Also from the same workshop: BSA 67 (1972) pl. 25, G 24; later, Payne no. 30, early LG. 52GG/&gt;244. 53 F. 148 f.</page><page sequence="38">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 32I derived mainly from the MG stock, and almost always arranged in narrow horizontal strips. In contrast to the somewhat monotonous ornament of these pithoi are those with schemes based on the square metopal panel, made within or under the influence of the LG Bird workshop.54 These pithoi, decorated with a repertoire of motifs that is largely new, forestall the Orientalizing polychromes in introducing tripod looped feet. Although there is some overlap between these two types, our second category will include all pithoi influenced in any way by the innovations of the Bird workshop. (i) LG, conventional LG, early: 219.38, 229.27 fr., 132.10, 292.153 fr., 75.163 (all four-handled); 218.33 (two-handled). LG: 107.109 fr., 107.111, 283.20, 306.24, 306.9, 19.12, O 30, 306.7, 283.56, 107.117, H 10, O 31, 283.49 (all four-handled); H 7, 292.161 fr., M 4, Q,73 fr., Q,74 fr. (two-handled). LG, late: 132*6, 75.171, 75.164 fr., H 8, 26.16 fr., 75.68 (four-handled); 229.1, «94-37 fr., 292*243 fr&gt; 98-"5 fr-&gt; I3«-75 218.25, 218.57, 218.64 fr., O 33, 75.72 (two-handled). LG/EO: 218.132 fr., 107.30, 218.24, 292.152 fr., 292.41 (necked), 229.6 (fenestrated foot) (all four-handled); 75.122, O 32 (two-handled). An early LG group,55 of which 219.38 is typical, preserves two MG characteristics: a plump ovoid form, with panels in which the meander still plays a dominant role. Among its ancillaries, however, the cross-hatched lozenge chain already has an attenuated and cramped look, and the decoration no longer extends below the handle roots. Horizontal handles, following the usual MG practice, are single and fully painted; vertical straps are barred, in contrast to the vertical stripes applied there on the latest LG pithoi. During the central stage of LG, as the decorated area decreases, so the old hierarchy of motifs breaks down. Meanders give place to battlements, more adaptable to a reduced scale. The two motifs coincide on 283.20 and 306.24, in different panels; thereafter the battlement is much favoured, sometimes no broader than the lighter motifs which accompany it (e.g. 292.161). Often the decoration is limited to a mass of lighter motifs only, drawn in a fussy and miniaturist manner (H 7, M 4, O 31, 283.49). Two unusual schemes call for special comment. First 306.9, on which the vertical cables contribute to the lively variation between the four panels, continues the tradition of distinctive MG pithoi F 9 and F. no. 693 noted above. Secondly, the leaf-and-chevron motif of H 10 allows attribution to the painter of four other pithoi,56 all with very similar decoration; but the considerable divergences in their shape, from the almost globular F. no. 781 to the attenuated ovoid form of Gypsades no. 64, makes it unlikely that they were all thrown by the same potter. We therefore rely here on decoration, rather than shape,57 as the chief criterion for placing LG pithoi in chronological sequence. In spite of a general movement towards attenuation, plump LG pithoi are not always early. 54 F. 149 IV B, 'Bird group' listed as EO; cf. GGP 246 ff.

Perhaps their earliest appearance is on the fragmentary 107.109, bearing a florid meander-based scheme still in the MG tradition: here the white circles are tentatively confined to the spaces by the handles. Later they spread to one (283.49) or two (H 7) dark zones below the main decoration, sometimes continued in vertical columns each side of the handles of two-handled pithoi so as to frame the reserved panel on three sides (H 7, H io9 M 4). Sometimes the lower groups of reserved lines may also be bordered in white (283.49, H 10). Later in LG the white circles occur more frequently, often accompanied by white enhancement of reserved lines. Here we have a phase when pithoi seem more often to have two handles than four. Indeed, the straps of the latter are so small and flimsy in relation to the size of the vessel that they appear to be more ornamental than functional. Their normal decoration is now a vertical line, as seen on the handles of the other closed shapes at this time. Characteristic of these late LG pithoi are the narrower and higher feet (229.1, 218.57, O 33, 75.68) and the narrower mouth, the lip now often being partly reserved; the lower body profile is often straight, and may even be concave (H 8). As for the decoration, a typical piece is the two-handled 229.1, with its elongated battlement and its cramped lozenge chain; to the more popular battlement, multiple zigzags (218.25, 57, 64) provide an alternative. Among the smaller motifs, the 'blind' undotted lozenges of 218.64 and 75.72 do not occur before this stage. On 75.72 the intrusion of small lateral metopes on the main composition creates a scheme found at this time on many other shapes.58 Finally, a few pithoi are decorated in a manner suggesting a brief transitional stage between LG and EO.59 To be sure, the PGB-EG stock of 'orientalizing' curvilinear ornament had never wholly vanished from the G repertoire: witness the cables of 306.9 and the frequent use of tongues, arcaded (107. 1 11) or otherwise, as an ancillary. Now, however, new and larger motifs of eastern character begin to appear tentatively in an otherwise G context. Thus, alternating with the elaborate lozenges on 218.24, we see a crude 'Phoenician' palmette and the guilloche; the latter, seen also on 292. 152,60 is destined to become a leading motif of EO. The extremely narrow panels of 107.30 and 218.132 have a Subgeometric look, as does the chaotic design of 75.122 revealing a total collapse of LG discipline. O 32 still retains a LG lozenge chain, but the three-metope composition below and the wide spacing of the white circles look forward to EO. The necked pithos 292.41 leads to a whole-hearted EO revival of this shape; 229.6, with its fenestrated pedestal, also seems the earliest of its class,61 which must surely overlap in time with EO polychrome pithoi of similar shape.62 (ii) LG, with metopal decoration (a) From the Bird workshop LG, early: 85.2, 26.13 fr.

(all four-handled). Within this most innovative circle of Knossian LG vase-painting63 several additions can now be made to the repertoire, and the internal development can be better understood. An early LG stage, still recalling the plump and floridly decorated pithoi of MG, is suggested by 85.2 and 26.13. Characteristic of the workshop are the plump shape and the broad zone below the handles; also the elongated meanders with heavy outlines, and the columns of intersecting vertical zigzag which were to become the chief 'triglyph' motif separating metopal panels; but neither the birds not the metopal systems have yet arrived. These are first seen on 163.3. There the birds have all the usual idiosyncrasies - long sinuous neck, raised wing with hatching, predatory claws, and drooping fan tail; here a contrast with an imported metopal piece, the Attic LG I bird skyphos 75.162, will help to bring out the individual flavour of this workshop. Other pithoi of this stage are sadly fragmentary, but two- headed birds can be made out on 40.45, 219. 87,64 283.76, Q78 and (¿79; one bird on Q, 79 evidently had three heads. Also in character are the various fillings of the birds' bodies and wings, as alternatives to simple hatching: chevrons (219.87, 283.76), diagonal crosses in panels (Q, 79) and, especially on the later pieces, cross-hatching. Zonal motifs not previously known from this workshop include the now old-fashioned cable (163.3), combined on 294.33 with the hatched zigzag which also appears in white on the dark shoulder zone of 40.45. This motif, and the later white decoration, were to become more frequent on the later LG pithoi of this workshop. The shapes, so far, have been mainly two-handled, without any trace of the tripod looped feet introduced into the workshop from F. no. 988 onwards. The birds on that pithos, however, are close enough to those of 163.3 to indicate that looped feet were already being added at this central LG stage - especially on bulkier pithoi more than 45 cm high, for which they might be needed as extra handles.65 The late LG pithoi are all large (H. 44-52 cm), loop-footed and four-handled. In contrast to the bucrania of the earlier two-handled LG pithoi, the horizontal handles are now single. Strap handles of generous proportions allow for four spacious metopal panels, in which birds alternate with linear motifs; sometimes all the motifs are linear (104.3). I*1 the flanking 'triglyphs' the usual intersecting vertical zigzag may sometimes degenerate into mere cross- hatching (292.236). Metopal designs include the checkerboard (40.31, 104.4, O 19), the net of detached double lozenges (104.3, O 19, O 27), and complex variations on the themes of quatrefoil (40.31, O 19, 104.4) and lozenge cross (292.236, 219.31). In general, the flamboyance of the decoration, covering at least half the surface, is in sharp contrast to the austerity and restraint of 'conventional5 pithoi at this time. On 1.14 even the spaces between the loop feet are decorated, in anticipation of many EO polychrome pithoi. The birds of this large group - large, sprawling and tightly encased within the square frame - are by a hand unknown among the F. finds. Often the wing is omitted; the body is usually cross-hatched, apart from a suggestion of plumage on the strange three-headed creature of O 19. There the painter has allowed his imagination to run riot.

COLDSTREAM heads portrays a typical pose of the water-bird; one pecks at the ground, or water; a second looks to the front, poised for flight; a third, about to rest its long neck and beak upon its back, is composing itself for sleep. The space below leaves room for a diminutive offspring with at least two heads, and perhaps a third obliterated by a crack in the surface. The origin of this fantasy may be sought in the most permanent of Minoan art-forms, for a class of LM I lentoid sealstones66 shows groups of swans in just these poses. Another feature of this late group is the invasion of subsidiary white-on-dark decoration, with a repertoire going far beyond the simple circle rows of the 'conventional' pithoi. White ornament appears mainly in the zones above and below the main metopes, sometimes added to the dark-on-light zones of meander and the like (O 19), but more often replacing them. As on F. nos. 1441 and 1501, these dark zones are usually divided into small metopal compartments, enclosing simplified versions of the repertoire in the handle zone. On O 19, among the wide variety of white metopal motifs, the oriental guilloche keeps company with the neo-Minoan octopus, the latter establishing a link with Domed Lids B (iv). This type of decoration continues on the EO Praisos lekythoi, among which 75.209 looks very close to the Bird workshop. (b) Influenced by the Bird workshop LG: 60.13, 107.113, 287.1. LG, late: 126. 1, 292.151, 292.147, 306.8, 292.31 fr., 292.148, 75.56. LG/EO: 218.29 fr., 292.40, 79.4, 292.159 fr., 292.235 fr. (75.56 two-handled; otherwise all four-handled) Of this miscellaneous lot the first three are slim, like most 'conventional' pithoi. Thereafter, almost all have the plump proportions customary in the Bird workshop and, from late LG onwards, the tripod looped feet. In the decoration, the workshop's influence appears in various ways, whether in the metopal syntax, or in the drawing of the birds, or in other metopal motifs (e.g. the massed double lozenges of 60.13), or in the filling of the triglyphs, or merely in the zones of elongated meander. Especially close are the birds of 126.1 and 292.151, both by the hand of Atsalenio A 4; but in the subsidiary white decoration no painter of the Bird workshop would have been content only with rows of circles. The eccentric and somewhat chaotic painter of 75.56, with its old-fashioned bucrania, had no similar inhibitions; the decoration is wholly in white, as also on its unique metopal lid made to match. The ornament of 292.40 displays a restless eclecticism of motif and syntax, a heady mixture of old and new, which is symptomatic of the transitional LG/EO stage. The experimental Tree of Life relates this fine piece to E no. 1047, but the hand is different. In the metopal designs of 79.4, 292.159 and 292.235, three works by the same painter, improvisations on the LG lozenge and quatrefoil produce a variety of geometricized flower, including a very schematic lotus consisting of a lozenge intersected by vertical arcs. The contrast of shape between 79.4 and 292.159 implies, once again, that the same painter might work for more than one potter. 66 Evans, PM IV, 492 figs. 426-7; Boardman, Greek Gems &amp; Finger Rings (London, 1970) 101, pls. 94-5: cf.

In shape, lids fall into two main categories: conical, with central knob; and domed, without knob. Small lids, less than 15 cm in diameter, are considered below in connection with pyxides. The Conical Lid Unlike most domed varieties, these lids were made to fit their pithoi, often echoing their decoration. Except for the coarse type A, rims are not articulated. Apart from a few early lids with interior bands recalling the kalathos-lid (e.g. D 20, O 5), the inside is left unpainted. A. FOR COARSE STRAIGHT-SIDED PITHOI Vertical inverted lip.

These lids, often at least 30 cm in diameter, share the deep red, coarse, gritty and very micaceous clay of the pithoi for which they were intended. Wall profiles are straight or slightly convex; knobs may be broad, flat and rough (219.60; cf. F. no. 486) or smaller and more carefully shaped, with a short concave stem and a slight spike on top (287.17). Decoration, where any survives, is confined to bands in added white, matching the corresponding pithoi.

LG: 292.65. 306.27, which fits the PGB necked pithos 306.26, still has something of the kalathos in its shape and semicircle ornament. Then follows a series of huge and floridly decorated lids made to cover the wide mouths of PGB and EG straight-sided pithoi, whose near-vertical body profile is answered by the steep slope of the lids. So vast is the scale that the stems, when solid, need firing holes (G 7, 283.31, 292.61); on 107.106, the largest of all (D. 38 cm), the stem is hollow. Later the shape settles down to a gentler slope in harmony with the shoulder curve of the neckless ovoid pithos. 107.154, an unusual EG experiment, has four handles answering to those of the new pithos shape. From then onwards the decoration conforms to the dark ground and predominantly Atticizing G repertoire of the pithoi. 67 F. 162, class B.</page><page sequence="43">326 J- N. COLDSTREAM Attic, too, is the original inspiration behind both types of ornamental knob. On a much smaller scale, imports like the Attic MG I pointed pyxis, 283.9 + 46, introduce the idea of the conical finial, and also of the ribbed stem of type C below; and on some Attic MG I flat pyxis lids68 the finial is combined with a miniature flat pyxis. When enlarged to the vast scale of the PGB and EG lids, the finials invite decoration in their own right. In MG, as the size and gradient of the lids decrease, so too the finial may become flattened into a rounded knob. The miniature vases, unknown on the F. lids before the LG Bird Workshop,69 are here represented in a full sequence from PGB onwards. Even though the idea is Attic, the repertoire remains wholly Knossian. Thus in PGB-EG we see minuscule versions of the globular pyxis (D 20, 107.154), the lekythos (G 7) and even of the tall straight-sided pithos, with (107.138) or without handles (107.106). Unattributed fragments of small and baseless vases, like the hydria fr. 285.35, may well have been broken off such lids. From MG onwards the miniatures rest on the solid inverted conical knobs of type D: there are traces of a miniature on 75*84 from the MG Stirrup Workshop, and the lid of Payne no. 31 (early LG) bears a neck-handled amphora. The miniature oinochoe of 292.65 recalls the lid of F. no. 1366 from the Bird Workshop, which also favours neck-handled amphorae on its lids (F. nos. 988, 1047). The tradition of miniatures survives in the pyxis on the EO white-painted lid 292.38, and also in the ring-handled cauldrons crowning some polychrome lids (O lids type III C). C.

LG, early: 107.132, 283.60, 134.6, 294.30, 75.123. LG: 218.49, 229.2. This and the next type70 were made only for neckless ovoid pithoi. The earliest, 100.53, richly decorated in the Atticizing manner of 100.43, attempts clumsily to combine a multi-ridged stem with a conical finial, as on Attic MG pyxis lids (cf. 283.9); on F. no. 531 the attempt is more successful. On 132.14 the finial is reduced to a mere spike rising from a broad flange, but thereafter disappears. The other MG decorated examples belong to a homogeneous group associated especially with the pithoi of the Horse Workshop like 218.23.71 The knob now has a broad top, flat or slightly concave, its edge overhanging two or three ribs on the stem. The dark ground ornament echoes the Atticizing style of the pithoi, in a single broad zone of meander or lozenge chain, latticed or in solid paint. To this group belong 125.4 with birds and - in shape - the lids of the two bucchero pithoi. Spanning the MG-LG transition is a group with more vertical ribbing, the upper edge now aligned with the ribs; the cross on the knob may be simplified in various ways, or omitted. After the change to LG the wall decoration is no longer Atticizing (107.132, 283.60). Thereafter the ribs are reduced to one only; the type begins to lose its consistency and 68 E.g.

LG/EO: 218.77, 75.150, 75.179, 292.173. The first two, with their tentative button-like knobs, belong respectively to the small straight- sided pithos D 12 and the huge ovoid pithos G 8. No less experimental are O 5 and 175.49» whose handles and interior banding still recall the kalathos-lid. In MG, when this type first becomes common,73 the knob assumes its usual inverted-conical form, e.g. 175.44. Less typical is the almost cylindrical stem of 75.138 and 140, which anticipates the EO shape. The knob's regular decoration, a reserved cross, is another legacy from the kalathos-lid. So far, the lids have carried at least one zone of ornament. This they lose in LG in favour of bands and lines, or lines only (292.167, Q, 87). On the knob, the reserved cross is retained for a time, and then displaced by a set of concentric circles. Towards the end of LG white-on-dark circle zones appear. Their elaborated form on 292.173 is exactly matched on the pithos 292.148, for which this lid was surely intended. Broader and shorter knobs are a usual feature of the latest LG and transitional LG/EO lids. The Domed Lid Domed lids are usually without knobs, and most were not originally designed to cover cremation pithoi. That they have a life of their own is indicated by their frequent occurrence outside the cemeteries, and by their presence in some tombs (e.g. T. 132 and the Teke tholos) in large and homogeneous sets. Provided at first with a single horizontal handle at the rim, and later with a pair of adjacent string-holes near the rim, their outer surface could be displayed, hung up on a wall. Brock, remarking on their general resemblance to the bronze votive shields from the Idaean cave, suspected 'some religious purpose'.74 Indeed this and no other type of G and EO lid appears among the offerings in the Knossian sanctuary of Demeter.75 They are also common, however, in domestic contexts;76 doubtless, a shield-like lid was thought to be no less protective of household goods than of human ashes. 72 This lid can hardly have been intended for the MG pithos 218.50 upon which it was found. 73 Cf. F nos. 423, 596, 642, 841, 1391. Several of our fragmentary MG lids probably also belong to this type: 1.3, 147.2 and 3, 292.125. 74 F. 164 f, class E. Cf. R. W. Hutchinson.

COLDSTREAM Abundant finds from the N Cemetery allow a clearer and fuller view of their stylistic sequence. Unexpected novelties include a small group of MG domed lids with knobs, and the regular appearance of white-on-dark decoration somewhat earlier than on the pithoi; possibly the new technique was first adopted as a general rule by the makers of these lids, aiming to simulate the appearance of bronze shields. In the ornament of the later clay-ground lids, Brock noted an 'archaistic trend' for which religious conservatism, he thought, was a possible reason. Another is their almost complete independence of the pithoi, which often makes them hard to date. Their decoration is closely related to pithoi only in the curvilinear style of EG and, to a lesser extent, in the white-on-dark of late LG. In between they virtually ignore the rectilinear austerity of the prevailing dark-ground Atticizing MG style: a light ground remains the rule, the whole surface being covered with many narrow concentric zones in which several motifs survive from the local PGB-EG repertoire. The new finds help to define a largely non- Atticizing MG phase in the development of these lids. Domed lids are here classified in the first place according to the two alternative schemes of decoration, the wholesale conversion to white-on-dark occurring during the course of LG; and then by a consistent development of profile, in which the breadth of the central dome steadily increases at the expense of the offset rim, while the height gradually decreases in relation to the diameter. A. CLAY GROUND (i) Omphaloid lids: high dome, broad and steeply sloping rim. One horizontal handle. EG: N 7, N 8, 218.90, F 11 fr., 218.135 fr.: 13.17, 292.123, 292.165 fr. MG: 6o.io, 292.139, M 11 fr. Two groups can be distinguished. In the first, a high umbilical boss, often with a shallow central depression (N 7, 8), rises from a very broad and steeply sloping rim which occupies at least a third of the whole profile. The interior is unpainted. Outside, decoration is applied in the EG manner, either in broad masses (N 7, 8; cf. F. no. 401) or in closely packed narrow zones repeating the same motif (218.90, F 11; cf. F. no. 488). The pattern on 218.135 is drawn from the repertoire of the Tree painter. Omphaloid lids of the second group have a broader dome, still sharply offset from the sloping rim, and with a deep re-entrant below the carination. The top is flattened, sometimes crowned with a raised disc as on 292.123 (cf. F. nos. 402, 719). In the decoration, massive curvilinear motifs of EG (13.17, 292.123 and 165; cf. Teke tholos nos. 42, 44) are succeeded by a syntax of narrow concentric zones, some left empty (M 11; cf. F. no. 389). The motifs, rectilinear but in no way Atticizing, include the widely spaced billets typical of MG (60.10); these, together with the solid-spoked wheel of 292.139, create a strong impression of radiation from the centre, also characteristic of the next MG type. The interior is usually banded or fully painted. (ii) Lids with lower dome and shorter rim; one horizontal handle. MG: 132*159 16 fe, 17-20, 23, 39 fr.; 125.11, N 28. The fabric, shared by some of the later omphaloid lids, is remarkable for its thick cream slip, always carefully polished. Except for the slight nipple of N 28, the top of the dome is gently</page><page sequence="46">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 329 rounded; the rim is now less sharply offset. The homogeneous group of nine from T. 132, all banded inside, display a narrow range of motifs drawn in a miniaturist manner, sometimes in as many as ten (132.17) zones: grid pattern, billets, single zigzag, intersecting wavy lines, lozenge chain and horizontal S's. Sometimes alternate zones are left empty (132.15, 20, 23); a radiating effect is achieved through spaced billets (132.23, N 28), double-lozenge columns (125. 11) and especially the elegant medallion on 132.18 composed of four 'trees' and a slender rosette.77 Evidence for placing this light-ground type in MG comes from T. 125, in which all the four urns are in the normal Atticizing dark-ground style ofthat phase. In addition to 125. 11, with them also is an early Praisos-type lekythos 125.2, by the same hand as 132.18. Four of the lids from the Teke tholos also belong to this type: nos. 39, 41, 43 and 54, the last very similar to 1 25.11. (iii) Handleless lids, with string-holes MG: 175-475 107.91, 107.158, 175.45 fn, 40.34, O 11; also 107.90, 218.142, with knobs. LG, early: 218.69, 218.123, 218.125, 218.30, 26.14 fr. Apart from the replacement of the handle by a pair of suspension holes,78 these lids show no consistent difference in shape from the preceding type. The MG knobbed group, to which the large and fragmentary 175.45 may also belong, betrays some influence from conical lids of type D, and could have been made especially for pithoi; but they, too, have suspension holes. The decoration is now more eclectic. Heavy Atticizing motifs, such as the meander, the battlement and the multiple zigzag, may be added to the previous repertoire, often bringing the lids into closer rapport with contemporary pithoi; the fabric, too, is more like that of the pithoi, the polished cream slip being less in evidence. The almost flat centre of the dome allows for a spacious central medallion which may contain a heavy and old-fashioned rosette (218.123), or a reserved cross borrowed from the knobs of conical lids (40.34), or a circle of slender hatched leaves (218.69, 130) as on early LG pithoi; or even a quartet of typically Cretan birds, with wings raised (107.158). Other birds, in superimposed pairs, alternate with hatched leaves on the fr. 26.14, which fits and seems to belong to an early pithos from the Bird Workshop, 26.13; but the style of the birds also suggests a link with the MG Horse Workshop (cf. 292.45, 149). For a brief revival in EO of the clay-ground domed lid, with rather mannered decoration, see O domed lids B(i). B. WITH WHITE-ON-DARK DECORATION No handle; suspension holes; no paint inside. (i) Various early examples LG, early: 132.335 283-57* 283.68 fr., 283.69-70, 292.169-71, 190; 60.26 fr., 40.33 fr. 77 The lid shown with the pithos Wide fig. 17 (LG) bears a later and less coherent version of this design. 78 Handle and hole(s?) coincide on the EG fr. F. no. 401, but not apparently on any lid from the North Cemetery.</page><page sequence="47">330 J- N- COLDSTREAM Experiments in white-on-dark begin on domed lids long before the general acceptance of the new technique in LG on other shapes. Five lids from F. tomb TFT echo the shape and decoration of MG clay-ground lids in various ways: there are low omphaloi on four (nos. 664, 676, 667, 679), of which the first two also have a handle; and the billet-and-zigzag zones of no. 674 are reminiscent of clay-ground lids like our 60.10 and 132.20. These features might plausibly be attributed to later archaism, were it not for the occurrence of five white-on-dark lids in a pure MG context above the Unexplored Mansion, of which the only one with a complete profile has a low omphalos and a hatched zigzag on the broad rim.79 This hatched zigzag is also popular as an outer motif on the lids listed here (e.g. 292.169-71); but now it no longer adorns the rim, which in its LG form has shrunk to an exiguous lip rising slightly above the resting surface. The central reserved cross of 283.70 recalls the knobs of early LG conical lids; other motifs, like the small hatched leaves of 132.22, are also at home on early LG pithoi. In general the decoration is more varied and more complex than on later LG lids. (ii) Standard LG white-on-dark lids LG, later, and LG/EO: 292.172, 292.240, 19.27, 60.19, 306.30, 104.127, 218.61, 2I8.IO9, 2I8.I2I, 134.46, 163.2, 75.125, 219.76, 79.3, 306.31, F/67: 4.9, I34.57- Firm associations with pithoi are few; but 19.27 and 218.61, found with the late LG pithoi 19.12 and 218.57, illustrate the white-on-dark domed lid in its most standardised LG form. The diameter is usually between 18 and 21 cm. The very short rim, less sharply offset than before, is sometimes flat, and sometimes turned upwards; it may carry dots, bars or billets, but is often left plain. The outermost of at least three zones is almost always occupied by double circles; perhaps their use as an ancillary ornament on the pithoi may imply a wish to bring the urns into harmony with their lids. Other common motifs are the cable, opposed double semicircles (75.125), horizontal S's, and outline tongues which often become the petals of a central rosette. Other patterns in the central medallion include the reserved cross (218.109), the whirligig (163.2), and segmented chevron leaves (292.172). The overall grid of 134*47 is an unusual departure from the normal zoning. This orthodox type of white-on-dark lid continues into EO without much change. (iii) With massed circles LG, late and LG/EO: 134*56, 134*58, 134*70, 126.2, 126.9. Circles, with or without narrow intervening zones of bars or dots, here form the only major motif of decoration. The shape is as type B (ii) but the circles are larger and normally triple. Their presence in T. 134, as well as the pithoi associated with 126.2 (126. 1) and F. no. 584, confirm their appearance considerably before the end of LG; but their production may last well into O. 79 UM II, 71-2, deposit GD nos. 26-30; the complete profile is no. 26, pl. 54.</page><page sequence="48">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 33I (iv) The Octopus group LG/EO: 292.168, 75.45, 75.180, H 12, 306.29, 292.189, 19.6. The shape and outer zones are as B (ii), but the central medallion encloses a revival of the Minoan octopus in simple outline. The uppermost two tentacles are divorced from the other six, but attached to the head. It is hardly surprising that a painter of this time should reduce the octopus to a near-symmetrical format; even so, the placing of the head and body above the full complement of tentacles suggests direct influence from rediscovered specimens of the true LM I B Marine style, rather than that of subsequent LM phases when the creature is inverted and docked of some of its limbs. These seven lids, together with Teke tholos no. 52 and four more published by Alexiou,80 are homogeneous enough to be the output of a single painter, related through the O 19 octopods to the Bird workshop.81 OTHER LIDS A coarse and heavy flat lid, 100.27, could have covered one of the three coarse pithoi from this largely ninth-century tomb. It is stamped eight times with the design of a strange sphinx with birdlike talons, raising one forepaw. The conical cap and straight wing recall the oriental- inspired creatures on the bronze quiver, F. no. 1469; but the body is equine rather than feline, as much later on an Attic LG II shallow skyphos.82 The mastoid lid 218.47, covered with radiating rows of double circles on a cream slip, was found with the late MG pithos 218.43. Perhaps it brings with it the four lids of similar shape from E tomb P, assigned by Brock to LG.83 The Neck-handled Amphora The SM type with rope handles survives into EPG, eventually to be superseded by the Atticizing PG amphora. There is an appreciable overlap between the two types, indicated not only by contexts but also by signs of mutual influences. A. SM TYPE (CONTINUED) Diagonally slashed handles to rim or just below, light ground, usually a horizontal S on shoulder. SM/EPG or early EPG: i8.i8, 56.38, 207.51, 207.50, 24.3, 24.4, 48.9, 207.30. EPG: J 20. Our series began with the SM piece 200.4, distinguished by a deeply concave neck and a plump globular-conical body preserving the doubly curved profile of Minoan tradition. The development of this SM shape into EPG is towards a straighter, taller neck and a taut ovoid body, probably influenced by the Atticizing PG type, though never so slim. The double curve, already minimal in 207.50 and 207.30, never quite disappears. The base is flat or slightly 80 KCh 4 (1950) 294 ff. 81 Coldstream, Reflexions 27-9, figs. 2.3, 2.4. 82 Athens 784, Schweitzer GKG pl. 65. 83 F. 163, class D.</page><page sequence="49">332 J- N- COLDSTREAM concave. Handles, as in SM, are flattened and then slashed diagonally, to resemble rope (with the exception of the plain straps of 207.30; cf. E no. 213). The neck, usually plain, may sometimes carry a wavy line (207.51, 48.9), repeated on the shoulder of J 20. As another rare deviation from the usual S on the shoulder, concentric circles are once (48.9) borrowed from the Atticizing PG amphora. Among the F. tombs this type was tentatively assigned to MPG because of the context of no. 213 in tomb IV. This dating, no less tentatively followed in the publication of the Ay. Ioannis cemetery,84 received some further support from an association in a single-burial tomb at Isopata.85 But now it seems that these later examples - if correctly so dated - mark the end of a long series extending through SM and EPG. B. ATTICIZING PG TYPE Taller neck, slimmer ovoid body, strap handles to well below neck, flat base. Light ground body, usually with concentric circles on the shoulder. EPG, early or conservative: 175-36 fr., 45.6 fr. EPG: 48.10, 48.8; smaller, 80.2. MPG: 287.13,1 5; smaller, J 38. LPG: E i, 28.12, D 15. PGB: 175.61 fr., A 1 fr. At once the Attic model was adapted to local taste. It may well account for the slimmer proportions, and the retreat of the handles below the rim; but the traditional double curve - recalling the SM type - is still evident even in MPG (287.13). The Attic ring foot is a refinement which does not reach the local series before MPG.86 Likewise, in the decoration, the Attic PG sequence progresses from light to dark ground, and very soon from concentric circles on the shoulder to the more suitable semicircles;87 all through the local EPG and MPG, however, Knossian potters prefer a dark neck with bars on the rim and a light body with full circles on the shoulder. This does not mean that the Cretan versions were in the first instance modelled on very early Attic PG amphorae bearing full concentric circles.88 On the contrary, associations with Attic imports in F. tombs VI and XI,89 and also Teke J, preclude a dating earlier than Attic LPG. Even if Cretans might sometimes apply semicircles to smaller EPG shapes,90 on amphorae and other large forms their preference was for sets of full circles. The only extant Attic import of this form (285.129) is a dark-ground piece at the very end of Attic PG, when circular ornament had passed out of fashion; but it finds no reflection in the Cretan series, which had already parted company with Attic prototypes. Our examples complement a series already well documented from the F. tombs. From 175.36, with is fringed verticals and floating zigzags, we learn that the Atticizing shape was more readily assimilated than the circle ornament. Likewise the detached spirals look like the work of a vase-painter who had seen concentric circles on Attic imports, but had yet to master the use of compass with multiple brush. The unusual motif on 48.8, latticed lozenge within a chevron, could have been borrowed from Cyprus.91 On smaller pieces, latticed lozenges (80.2) 84 BSA 55 (i960) 129 f., Li; 145. ss BSA 58 (1963) 38, III. 1. 86 BSA 55 (i960) 142, Vase B. v PGP6ÏÏ. 88 E.g.

Otherwise full circles remain the rule throughout EPG and MPG, as in the F. tombs. Handles usually bear elongated S's. During LPG circles pass out of currency, leaving nothing but spaced bands on a wholly light-ground vase; on the handles, S's are replaced by two or more diagonal crosses. E 1 illustrates the process of change, combining the new handle motif and a light neck with circles still on the shoulder, though now enclosing Maltese crosses. The developed LPG amphorae with bands only, 28.12 and D 15 (cf. E no. 285, Ay. Ioannis I. 3-4) are among the tallest and slimmest in the PG series. Light-ground examples are rare thereafter. The sadly fragmentary 175.61 offers a glimpse of a typically PGB fantasy: birds facing in opposite directions, supported by close zones of the zigzag and solid triangle motifs with which the creatures' bodies are filled. On A 1 circles return in an elaborated PGB-EG form enclosing a zone of bars (cf. M io, 283.54). Before considering the dark-ground G successors to this series, we should take note of a smaller light-ground relative of the two PG types. C. PG AMPHORISKOI (LIGHT-GROUND) EPG: 56*39; 207.22, 26, 28, 29, 46, 64, 77 fr. MPG: J35. LPG: Q5. 56*39 stands by itself, a miniature of the Atticizing PG type at an early stage and decorated with a fringed composition like that of 175.36. The other five EPG pieces, all from the same tomb, are of a type unknown among the F. corpus, matched only by a later PG example from Kourtes92 which has long lacked companions. The neck is broad and vertical, the handles come to the rim; a well-shaped ovoid-conical body rests on a high conical foot, not unlike the body of a stirrup-jar93 but much slimmer. Decoration consists usually of concentric semicircles, standing on the shoulder, pendent on the neck, and drawn freehand until 207.77. A very thin hatched zigzag is a less frequent motif on the neck (207.46, 64). Vertical wavy lines run down the handles; the lower body and foot bear solid paint. The dating of the group from T. 207, as with so many other vessels from that tomb, is somewhat conjectural. Freehand semicircles, though common in Attic Submycenean, are foreign to Subminoan tradition. The neat ovoid-conical shape and the dark-ground lower body argue a foreign PG prototype on which the semicircles are at home. One possible source of inspiration is the Euboean LPG amphoriskos, represented at Knossos by 285.124 and by another from an Ay. Ioannis tomb,94 both with standing semicircles on the shoulder. Even though both have handles attached at the neck, the same LPG potter at Lefkandi might indiscriminately attach handles to neck or rim.95 Granted that Euboeans did not apply pendent semicircles to this shape, that motif might have been taken from Euboean-influenced skyphoi like 207.12. Although semicircles were not widely used in Crete before LPG, a Euboean derivation would imply an EPG date for the T. 207 group; for that is when the imports must have arrived and, given the alacrity with which most local potters mastered the time-saving 92 AJA 5 (1901) pl. 9.15; L.

At all events, the shape is rare thereafter. In contrast to the elegant contours of the earlier pieces, the body of J 35 (MPG) has begun to sag - a deterioration which progresses further in Q 5 from an undisturbed LPG floor deposit. On this last vessel the shape has been assimilated to that of the normal neck-handled amphora with handles to the neck and with ring foot, while the pendent semicircles on the shoulder have been replaced by a wavy line. The Kourtes piece, which looks like an export from the Knossos area, now finds its place between these two later examples. A strange hybrid vessel, 207.3, related to this type but with an animal protome-spout placed on its shoulder, is here considered among the stirrup-jars. D. ATTICIZING G TYPE Dark ground, decorated on neck and shoulder. EG: G 1. MG: 134.15, 292.160, 292.57; smaller, 292.224 fr., Q51; miniature, 134.42. Influence from Attica, dormant since the tenth century, returns in the late ninth century through imports of Attic MG.96 Hence the conversion to a dark-ground body with groups of reserved lines, a further attenuation of the shape, and the provision of a well-formed ring foot. The exception, G 1, is also the earliest of this type, and the only one to draw its ornament from the local PGB-EG rectilinear stock. All others are Atticizing in decoration as well as in shape. The range of motifs is consistent with Attic MG II; two of them, the dotted lozenge chain (134.15) and the hatched meander hook (292.224) do not occur in Attica before that phase. The main motif, usually a hatched meander between ancillary strips , is placed in the reserved neck panel. On Attic originals one or more zones may run under the handle roots97 or - very rarely - a second panel may occupy a small part of the shoulder.98 But Knossian MG potters, who loved ebullient improvisations on Attic themes, may sometimes cover both shoulder areas with decoration, while enlarging the shape to a gigantic size. The best example is 134.15 (73 cm) which far surpasses any Attic original in the exuberance of its ornament. The outlined tongues in the lowest zone show that the curvilinear PGB-EG repertoire could still play an ancillary role in large Atticizing MG schemes. The rope handles, however, are at this time a wholly Attic notion,99 requiring two coils of wet clay to be twisted together, and owing nothing to the SM-EPG precedent of slashed handles. It is only in MG that the decoration of neck-handled amphorae ever attracted the most ambitious vase-painters of the day. One from Fortetsa, with rope handles like 134.15, has shoulder panels containing tethered horses,100 at a time when any figured representation was very rare. Some of the largest amphorae appear to come from the best MG workshops of cremation pithoi. Thus the panelled birds on the handles of 292.160 are exactly as on the straps of 60.7, 292.45 and 292.149, three pithoi from the Horse workshop. Similarly on 96 The only recorded Attic import of this shape, BSA 55 (i960) 168 no. 79, is MG II or later (cf. 219.93 fr.), but a Cycladic piece, 283.91, is a very close copy of an Attic MG I original (see below). 97 E.g.

The circles, however, seem to have been borrowed from the belly- handled amphora, on which they lie more comfortably. Provincial Cretan versions of these large and grandiose amphorae have occurred at Arkades101 and Vrokastro.102 Towards the end of MG the size is reduced and the shape attenuated yet further. Already the shape is losing any direct contact with the Attic series. The tall and narrow neck of Q, 51 points the way towards the next and final G type. E. LATER G TYPE Smaller; very slim body, tall narrow neck. Dark ground. MG: G 99-100 frs., 175.55 frs., 107.193 fr., 134.14. LG: 104.11, 27, 58; 218.27. These small and slender amphorae were also common in domestic use.103 The context of tomb G and the uncouth meanders on the necks of G 99-100 imply that the type was already current in EG or early in MG. 175.553 with its unusual figure-of-eight motif, shares with G 99 a poorly articulated neck, also characteristic of our earliest complete example 134.14. This piece illustrates how the Attic syntax of the larger MG amphorae had been scaled down and simplified. In the neck panel, the MG meander is succeeded in LG usually by thin vertical columns of ornament underlined by a horizontal strip; note especially the intersecting vertical zigzag on the T. 104 amphora, a regular ancillary motif of the Bird workshop. Alternatively the neck may be filled by several horizontal strips as on F. nos. 652 and 681. The only other decoration is in a zone at or below the handle roots, containing opposed groups of oblique bars (134.14, 104.58), or diagonal crosses between bars (107.193), or single obliques between bars (104.27); all but the first are local simplifications of the usual double-axe-and-bars motif seen in this position on Attic MG originals. F no. 673 may mark a later stage of LG when continuous bands take over the body from the previous dark ground with groups of reserved lines. The type continues into EO (F no. 1335) in a light-ground form with very simple ornament, rather like a poor relation of the Praisos-type lekythos. The Belly-handled Amphora The full-sized amphorae are best treated in a single series. They respond in various ways, slowly at first and never with any great consistency, to the influence of Attic and Atticizing Cycladic imports. It is fortunate that we now possess a steady sequence of these imports from the tenth century until the early eighth, a sequence more continuous than for any other imported shape. The local series reaches an impressive floruit in PGB and EG, drawing on several sources of inspiration for their exceptionally florid ornament. Thereafter, when the imports cease, the shape virtually drops out of the local repertoire. 101 Arkades fig. 396. 102 Vrokastro pl. 28. 103 BSA 67 (1972) 78 f.

EG: G 2, 4, 5, 82; 283.59 fr., O 36 fr.; 104.12, 23, 16 fr. A well-established SM type (e.g. H2.i, F/67: 5.1) has a globular body with flat base, single handles at the belly, and narrow concave neck. The neck is dark, sometimes with one or more reserved lines. On the light-ground body the wavy line is the most usual motif, interspersed with bands between lines. The belly zone is always decorated, and sometimes the shoulder too. This SM type survives into the SM/EPG context of F. VI (nos. 70, 84), slightly less plump, and with more variety in the decoration; comparable, though more ornate, are Ay. Ioannis VIII. 15 and V.l. To this group belongs our 207.43, where the wavy line has been transformed into a thin zigzag clinging to the upper edge of the belly zone. None of these pieces bears any close resemblance to Attic PG. On the contrary, a native tradition persists into the local LPG in the tall light-ground amphorae F. nos. 140 and 243 decorated only with spaced bands, and evidently influenced by neck-handled amphorae ofthat phase like D 15. A local characteristic of all these amphorae, throughout the main PG series, is the straight profile of the lower body. After 207.43, however, our own series presents a very different picture. L 7 and J 4, a closely similar pair with broader neck, plump and rounded ovoid body and ring foot, are thoroughly Atticizing in shape. As for the decoration, they follow a normal Attic LPG scheme of closely-packed concentric circles on the shoulder of a light-ground body.104 In addition the shoulder of L 7 bears central rectilinear motifs, a latticed panel on one side, and a latticed lozenge on the other (cf. respectively the Attic LPG skyphoi J 15 and J 22); the semicircles of J 4 enclose small solid inverted triangles; and the dark paint of the neck is interrupted by reserved lines on L 7, and by a narrow zigzag zone on J 4. This pair will then be the only known large vessels of Knossian EPG - if local they be - to carry semicircles rather than full circles, which would indeed look unhappy on the sharply curving shoulders. Brock, however, diagnosed a very similar piece, F. no. 154, as an import - Atticizing Cycladic rather than Attic; and this now finds a good parallel from Naxos,105 even to the small enclosed triangles which it shares with J 4. The clay of our pieces, darker than what is normal for local PG, seems to match Brock's description of F. no. 154 quite well. None of the three amphorae in question, however, contains the mica which is usual, though not omnipresent,106 in Naxian clay. My own impression is that the fabric of L 7 and J 4, though far from typical, does not lie outside what is possible in Knossian PG. I see these two vessels as exceptionally close copies of Atticizing PG, differing from their prototype - and also from F. no. 154 - in the reservation of their necks which, as we have seen, has local antecedents. Once begun, the Atticizing character persisted into the ninth century. At a time when the import of other shapes had become very rare, Attic and Cycladic belly-handled amphorae continued to reach Knossos during the period of Attic EG. They introduced to the local repertoire a modified shape with new proportions, predominantly dark-ground. At once the 104 Cf. Kerameikos IV pl. 10.1073, pl. 11. 1098. 105 Cf.

The medium ovoid body now carries the main decoration on the belly, still based on concentric circles, sometimes with a central rectilinear panel (207.52, Attic EG I). A little later, two more imports, Q, 63 and 64 (Cycladic EG I), combine belly and shoulder decoration - mainly circular - with rectilinear Atticizing motifs in a reserved zone on the neck. Later still (100.39, Attic EG II; F. no. 269, Cycladic EG II), the lip of the larger amphorae is reinforced by a ridge below, and the single handles have been replaced by double-arc bucrania. All these modifications appear in the local versions, MPG in Cretan terms; the reinforcing ridge was adopted at about the same time as on the bell-krater. As for the intervening rectilinear motifs, there is a local preference for patterns based on the latticed lozenge J 1, Q, 62, 100.74), while Maltese crosses are often enclosed by the circles (Q, 66, 100.74, F 5). By the time of F 5 local improvisation had reduced the Attic dogtooth motif (e.g. 207.52) to a miniature scale characteristic of much LPG work. To this phase also belongs the smaller amphora ioo.i, with single handles, but barred in the manner of the next group of imports to which we shall now turn. A fresh batch of imported Attic MG I amphorae (G 3, G 83, N 6) seems fairly homogeneous in shape and decoration. The body assumes a slimmer ovoid form, surmounted by a much taller neck with a well-defined reinforcing ridge. Decoration is now confined to broad reserved zones on belly and neck. The hatched meander becomes predominant on the neck zone, between ancillary motifs. On the belly, placed vertically, it alternates with the traditional circles which are themselves hedged in by ancillary units on all four sides. The bucranium handles are barred between curved stripes. Cretan adaptations of this form are eclectic, displaying much more imagination than in previous phases. Some minor divergences can be put down to local conservatism: the avoidance of a broad neck zone with meander, the survival of some light-ground areas on the shoulder or lower body (G 2, 4, 5, 82; O 36), and the preference on the handles for curved stripes only, without bars (exceptions: D 14, F. no. 339). On some examples, especially those of EG, the local habit of straightening out the lower body profile reasserts itself. But at once there are adventurous new experiments, unknown on the Attic prototypes. On the PGB amphora F. no. 339, where the belly composition simplifies an older version of the Attic scheme (cf. 287.11), a shoulder zone presents eight strange arm-raising goddesses or mourners. In the same spirit are the janiform birds in the neck panels of D 14. The belly zone of this vase contains an Attic meander, taken out of its usual context and fancifully filled with check pattern; it appears latticed on the belly of a contemporary amphora from Forte tsa.107 Ever since EPG (e.g. F. no. 60) Cretan painters of large vessels had often varied the designs on the two sides of the vase. At least two EG painters of belly-handled amphorae carry this notion to extreme lengths, ringing the changes on three distinct repertoires of ornament: (i) the old PG circles, with check pattern and other PG ancillaries, e.g. G 2; (ii) the new PGB-EG motifs, mainly curvilinear and of oriental origin; and (iii) the Attic MG compositions with meander and rectilinear ancillaries. Sometimes the painter aims at the greatest possible contrast between the two belly designs. Thus on G 5 we find (A) Attic hatched meander between conservative PG check pattern; and (B) PG circles interspersed with PGB-EG billets, wrapped within a proto-orientalizing cable, the field stuffed with a net •07 BSA 56 (1961) pl. 9, A 3.</page><page sequence="55">3g8 J- N- COLDSTREAM of quartered lozenges. On other pieces by the same hand, G 4 and 82, similar elaborated circles are accompanied by three of the most striking PGB-EG motifs - cable, mill-sail, and hatched net pattern.108 On 104. 23109 a slightly later hand combines (A) a simplified rendering of the Attic MG circle-and-meander formula with (B) hatched running spiral between cables. By the same painter is 283.59, with freehand curvilinear motifs on both sides. The 'bilingual' pieces G 5 and 104.23 are of the greatest importance for relative chronology, confirming as they do the contemporaneity of Knossian EG with a central stage of Attic MG. After EG there is very little trace of the belly-handled form among the tomb offerings; in MG the best hands, so its seems, turned their attention to the neck-handled amphora. Domestic contexts, however, have produced neck fragments of this shape in MG and LG.110 The LG fragments 98.11 and 107.148 probably belong to this shape, which certainly survives into EO in a modified form (45.4 fr.). B. AMPHORISKOI EPG: Ji7&gt;a85-«4&gt;J3&gt;J6- EG: 283.41. This heading conceals two quite distinct shapes, separated from one another by at least a century. The EPG group, far from bearing any resemblance to the full-sized belly-handled amphora, have their nearest relations in the bell-krater and -skyphos family; it is only the slightly narrower mouth and the absence of any interior paint below the neck which places them among closed rather than open shapes.111 They evolve from SM antecedents (e.g. 2.2, 40.2) without any sign of outside influence. Decoration is limited to wavy lines, floating zigzags, languettes, and schematic trees (285.114). The globular shape of J 17, like Ay. Ioannis IV2, is indistinguishable from SM (cf. 40.2) except that the low conical foot is more clearly defined. Thence the development is towards a taller ovoid body (285.114), comparable to F. nos. 41, 49 and 60 from tomb VI. Later still, but also within EPG, the lower body straightens out J 3). The latest, J 6, is unusual in possessing a lid, J 10; for its thin hatched zigzag cf. the neck- handled amphoriskos 207.64. After a long interval, 283.41 is a true miniature of the belly-handled amphora. The careful concentric squares, framed by chequer-board and billets, relates it to the fine EG amphorae G 2, 4, 5 and 82.

The PG development of this hardy survivor from the Late Minoan repertoire was traced by Brock.112 Basing his analysis chiefly on comparisons between F. tombs Pi (SM) and VI and XI (in his view E-MPG)113 he noted what seemed to be some obvious changes from the SM prototype: in shape, from the depressed globular of SM to the plump ovoid customary for closed PG shapes, with higher conical foot; in the shoulder decoration, from concave-outlined triangles and compositions covering the whole field (SM) to rectilinear triangles with spaces between (PG). On our stirrup-jars, however, these changes do not coincide with any great consistency; hence a considerable overlap in this shape's development. Indeed, the movement towards straight outlines for triangles already begins in SM (18.19, 40.20, 98.20, 121.2, i6o.i), especially in the narrow spaces between the two necks (40.15; even F. no. 13). Three vessels, in particular, combine Brock's 'early' and 'late' features: 48.4 still has concave triangles elaborated in a SM manner, although the body is already ovoid; 24.2, by contrast, combines a SM depressed globular body (also 55.2) with a pronounced conical foot and wholly rectilinear triangles on the shoulder. After these transitional pieces the shape settles down to the usual plump ovoid of PG, although concave triangles may still occur in EPG (80.1). Check fillings arrive in MPG (L 16, Q, 89 fr., 285.156; cf. F. no. 158, Payne no. 1), when the triangles draw apart further and are reduced in size. The process of diminution and corresponding simplification continues in 285.110 and J 7. Rarer motifs at this late stage include multiple zigzags (175.30) and standing concentric semicircles (O 28 fr.), both with solid fillings; also the comb motif on J 16 and 207.70 fr., of Cypriot origin.114 On the last piece, the extraordinary freehand pendent semicircles on the belly look forward to the LPG open-necked type. As in F. the disappearance of the spike, leaving a flat or concave disc (207.70 fr., 242.1, 219.9, 285.110) is a late feature, here confined to the MPG phase. In LPG the normal type is represented by F. no. 287 and Payne no. 2, both of which echo the decoration of the open-necked vessels; but none of our pieces seems as late as these. B. WITH OPEN NECK Taut ovoid body, high conical foot, no air-hole. M-LPG: 207.3. LPG: D 11, 175.29; probably also the frs. O 13, O 90, 100.62, 219.17. The experimental fantasy 207.3 is hard to classify, but is best included with this final form of Knossian stirrup-jar. The animal protome-mouth, again of Cypriot derivation,115 is cautiously attached to the rim by a third strutted handle. The improbable birds on the shoulder, one with legs bent backward, are the earliest in post-Minoan vase painting. 112 F. 152 f. 113 Cf., however, Catling, pp. 308-09 in the previous chapter. 114 On Cypriot stirrup-jars, however, the occurrence of this motif is over a century earlier, on Proto White Painted Ware; and by Cretan MPG the shape was already defunct in Cyprus.

The central lozenges on the shoulder may be replaced by gridded zigzags, horizontal (100.62) or vertical (175.29; cf. F. no. 287). As on some later MPG stirrup-jars of the normal type, the hatched triangles are no longer composite. Shape and decoration in this group are very homogeneous, suggesting the output of a single workshop;116 the ornament is always drawn with a neat and sure hand, and can be matched on several other LPG shapes.117 Rather than the hydria as suggested by Brock,118 the stirrup-jar's most likely successor is the lekythos. If so, the open-necked stirrup-jar may be seen as a halfway stage between the normal type and the earliest lekythoi (here Type A). The Hydria Large plain banded hydriai, with minimal bracket decoration, were in the domestic repertoire from the end of the Bronze Age and persist through to the seventh century.119 The shape could also be rendered in coarse ware (G 137). As tomb offerings, more ornate versions begin in LPG, reach a climax of exuberance in PGB and EG, and thereafter occur only sporadically. A.

Full-sized domestic hydriai were occasionally offered with PG burials,120 but the function of these smellier hydriai seems to have been symbolic. A clue to the symbolism is offered by F. no. 514, a plain PGB miniature hydria with a cup mouth, which suggests that the one-handled cup was the hydria's complement in a libation set. As is apparent from hydriai from domestic contexts, the bracket ornament remains unchanged throughout the centuries of the Early Iron Age; but the lowering of the upper handle attachment from rim (G 36) to mid-neck (78.2) is consistent with the ornate sequence.

MG, late: 104.78, 104.90. LG: 104.91, 75.73. LG/EO: 292.83. Except for the four small hydriai from tomb 104, the body follows a predictable development from globular (LPG) to slim ovoid (LG). Sometimes, and especially in PGB, the shape is allowed to sag, the horizontal handles being placed well below the belly. The moulded lip, already present in LPG (287.8), often assumes a sharp metallic form thereafter. There is no consistency in the shaping of the base, but in general the more carefully decorated hydriai have ring feet. The full decoration, however, provides the best clues to dating. After the neat semicircles and hatched triangles of LPG come the florid combinations of PGB motifs, followed by the massing of spiraliform ornament characteristic of EG. The closely related group G 31-33, G 103 and 13.14 are the output of a fine EG workshop, in the style of the pithoi G 6 and G 8. In the belly zone, vestigial reminiscences of the traditional bracket ornament of the domestic hydria may be seen in the hatched motifs of G 33 and 107.185, as also of F. no. 493 and Atsalenio B 2. A popular alternative in this position is the widely spaced group of chevron columns, which link our N 3, Q50 and G 101 with an example from Kourtes;121 this motif goes back to the earlier PG hydria Ay. Ioannis VIII. 8 and even recurs in EO (14") After EG, a considerable gap in the full-size series is partly filled by the four small hydriai from tomb 104. In the shape, the plain flaring mouths and the dumpy globular bodies set them apart from the larger vessels. The careless sub-PGB decoration of 104.10 may be much later than it seems. The stars, zigzags and metopal birds of the other three, together with their shape, can be matched on miniature vessels of Attic MG II,122 but the intersecting zigzag on the neck of 104.91 takes us into an early stage of LG. The revival of the full-size hydria, with moulded lip, begins with 75.73, bearing shoulder decoration in the manner of the more conventional pithoi.123 Finally 292.83, with its highly individual silhouette birds, continues the miniaturist manner of the domed lids A (ii). The ornate hydria survives sporadically, into O times. C. COARSE Gritty red micaceous clay, incised decoration. PGB-EG: G 137.

Within this definition falls a large family of shapes in widely differing sizes, no doubt serving several purposes other than the pouring of wine; vessels with narrow necks would be more suitable for oil or liquid unguents. In the interests of consistency, all trefoil-lipped pouring vessels with handle to rim are here described as oinochoai, including types designated by Brock as 'small jugs and aryballoi'.126 A. PG TYPES, FULL SIZE H. over 15 cm. (i) Globular, light ground. After EPG, flat base. S on handle. EPG: O 2, 285.123. MPG: 285.96, 229.23, J 26, 175.31, Q,6; J 19, 100.11 fr., Q,9i. LPG: 287.14, G 92 fr. (or jug). Unlike the smaller PG type B, these globular vessels have no obvious precursors in the SM repertoire. After the loss of the EPG low conical foot, the base becomes increasingly broad through MPG and LPG. Decoration, between spaced bands, is at first confined to groups of pendent languettes on the shoulder, and sometimes a wavy line on the neck. During MPG, from J 19 onwards, concentric semicircles take over on the shoulder, with cross-hatched triangles (287.14) as a LPG alternative. Oinochoai of this PG type are well documented in the F. tombs.127 Nevertheless, it is likely that they were designed originally for household use, since in decoration and body shape they exactly match the corresponding PG domestic jugs (type A). The fr. D 31, with hatched leaves on the shoulder, may perhaps represent a PGB phase of this type.128 Thereafter it is not seen again until a revival in EO, with full circles on the shoulder (O oinochoe type A). (ii) Globular to ovoid, dark ground. Narrow ring or low conical foot. Handle barred. LPG: 287.25, Q,7, 28.8, 100.33. PGB: 285.141, 175.17, D 29, 219.7. These oinochoai, made and decorated with much greater care than A (i), already show some mainland influence, e.g. from very late Attic PG imports like J 8 and F. no. 1446. The shape progresses from globular through plump ovoid (LPG) to the slimmer and more graceful ovoid of PGB,129 always with a narrow foot.

In an unusually deep orange fabric, 100.33 *s an exceptionally fine piece, decorated with a profusion of rectilinear LPG ornament; the character and precision of the drawing recalls the contemporary stirrup-jars with open neck. The battlement zone on its belly, with its unusual gridded filling ornaments (squares and fish-tailed lozenge), has a curiously North Greek130 look at a time when Knossos may have been receiving imports from that direction, like the amphora 30.4. B. PG TYPES, SMALL H. less than 15 cm. Bars on handle. (i) Sides dipped EPG, early: 55.1. M-LPG: Q, 9 (fully-coated), 207.4 fr., 207.5 fr., F/67: i3-i(?). For 55* * 5 associated with a SM/EPG stirrup-jar, F. no. 69 from tomb VI provides a close parallel. A SM prototype (40.18, 121.4) is of similar biconical shape, but has its handle rising high above the rim, and was dipped from the foot - as also were the otherwise closely comparable SM/EPG trio Ay. Ioannis V. 7, 9 and 10. The flat-based Q, 9 is from a later PG context, and takes with it the pair from tomb 207. F/67: 13. 1 may perhaps belong here, although its broad neck might suggest a later date. (ii) Miniatures of type A, various MPG: 285.97, ioi, IO2. LPG: flat base, 285.74, 287.32; 207.60 (miniature); conical foot, 285.75, 76. PGB: flat base, G 23; conical foot, 287.31, 287.31a. PGB-EG: 134.29, conical foot; 75*198 fr.; 104.42, flat base. The first three, found inside the MPG bell-krater 285.82, are miniatures of the light-ground globular type A (i) in its MPG phase; likewise 285.74 and 287.32, with their triangles, echo its LPG stage (cf. 287.14). In LPG another series begins, following the more elegant dark-ground type A (ii) with conical foot, thick bands sometimes taking the place of the dark ground on the lower body. From PGB onwards, decoration may appear on the neck as well as on the shoulder. (iii) Squat body, flat base. Light ground, wavy line on neck. Bars on handle.

Cross-hatched triangles form the usual shoulder decoration, usually outlined. Inverted dogtooth (285.146, D 30), gridded chevron (285.120) and hatched leaves (283.38) are rare alternatives. In F. this type persists into MG contexts132 with various shoulder motifs and a more globular body. Our fr. 31.26 may perhaps belong to this later stage. (iv) Carinated and composite PGB: 218.82, 100.14 fr.; 104.84, 292.75, 104.43, 3°6*3 fr., 107.207 fr. EG: 286.5 (miniature). A variant of B (iii), also with lekythoi closely related in body shape and decoration (type B (ii)). A carination on the shoulder, with groove below, gives the impression of a composite vessel. This takes the form either of two superimposed oinochoai (218.82, 100.14; cf. F. no. 432) or of a squat oinochoe resting upon a pyxis, as the other PGB examples (cf. F, no 1464). The distinction depends largely on the placing of the widest diameter, but is also manifest in the choice of decoration: shoulder triangles for the oinochoe components, single zigzag or spiral for the pyxis bases. A debased miniature, 286.5, is from an EG context. In the shaping of the foot there is no consistency. C. ATTICIZING G TYPES Broad base, ring foot; dark ground. (i) Imitations of large Attic MG I-IL H. at least 20 cm. Reserved panel on neck. Handle barred. EG-MG: 283.30, 292.63, 292.59, 292*74» 104.100, 75.57 fr., 75.65, 283.10, 292.225 fr., 292.226 fr., 175.64 fr. LG: 292.23, 292.90 fr., 285.11, 283.1; 79.7 (light ground). In spite of their virtual absence from F.,m it now appears that the Atticizing broad-based oinochoe was the commonest form of large pouring vessel at Knossos throughout the eighth century. The Attic MG I imports like G 18 and 19 provide the earliest model, with a relatively tall rounded body and a graceful concave neck; close imitations like 283.30 and 292.63 thus fall into the local EG phase. Later, in MG, the more taut and compact body of the Attic MG II shape (107.141, 285.67) is also followed quite faithfully, with occasional lapses towards a sagging profile (75.65). Of the two usual Attic panel motifs the multiple zigzag is preferred to the meander, which on the frs. 292.225-6 has an uncouth EG look. Occasional concessions to local taste are seen in the billets of 75.65 and the spiral zone which on 175.64 invades the usual dark ground of the body. In LG the base becomes slightly narrower but the shape is not radically changed. Although Attic imports are now scarce, 292.23 (and 292.90 fr.) still has an Atticizing look, and follows contemporary Attic oinochoai134 in substituting massed lines on the body for the 132 F. nos. 1393, 1401, 1434, all with MG pithoi. 166 Apart trom the import no. 441 there is only the tr. no. 591. 134 Cf. especially Hesperia 30 (1961) pl. 15, O 7.</page><page sequence="62">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 3^ previous MG dark ground. By the time of 283.1, however, decoration has spread to the shoulder and become assimilated to the local stock. Finally 79.7, with circles on the shoulder and a light-ground body punctuated with groups of lines between bands, prepares the way for the revival in EO of the old PG globular type with shorter neck (see O oinochoai type A). (ii) Bucchero technique. Undecorated. MG: i3-l85 I3*«35 *3-35 fr«; 292.56 fr., 107.177 fr.; 125.1, 292.103 fr. The type of 13.18 closely follows the profile of the Atticizing MG oinochoe and, like the corresponding pithoi (type B (iv)), is symptomatic of a temporary vogue for the bucchero technique in this phase. The frs. 292.56 and 107.177 seem to be from smaller, squat and narrow-necked vessels, also MG. A different, more ovoid shape is represented by 125.1, but its context is exclusively MG. (iii) Imitation of large Attic MG lekythos-oinochoe EG: 283.2 fr. F. no. 1506, with a tall slow-pouring neck, represents the Attic prototype. Our fr., more floridly decorated, has some close parallels in Attic MG I.135 (iv) Small and squat PGB: 0,23. EG-MG: 292.100, 285.48, 107.81, 104.29. MG-LG: 104.94, no, 112. Q, 23 is from a closed PGB context. In spite of its light ground, the body shape and broad ring foot are Atticizing136 and belong here. The extraordinary procession of monsters is too sketchily rendered for us to fathom the painter's thoughts or intentions. Nevertheless there seems to be a wish to differentiate between the three creatures. The leader of the procession, a quadruped, combines a gaping beak and high ear with a feline tail; perhaps a griffin is intended. In the other two monsters, indices of horse, bird and insect are mixed together; one wonders whether the contemporary horse-bird askoi, like Q, 115 from the same deposit, may have been in the painter's mind. The four dark-ground vessels require little comment. As on many of the Attic counterparts,137 the main (and often the only) decoration consists of cross-hatched triangles on the shoulder.

Another remarkable novelty of PGB, without local antecedents. Eastern affinities were rightly detected by Brock, who saw the only F. example, no. 500, as the precursor of the Creto-Cypriot class.138 The model, however, is not in the native Cypriot repertoire but rather in a closely similar shape of Phoenician Red Slip, perhaps represented at Knossos by Payne no. 84. 139 Whereas the later Creto-Cypriot oinochoai at first copy Cypriot decoration, these vessels are at once covered with a profusion of ornament in the current Knossian style. Their large scale and exuberant decoration link them with many straight-sided pithoi, belly-handled amphorae and ornate hydriai, all painted in a style reserved for the upper reaches of Knossian society. In fact, personal preference or family connections, as well as high status, may account for their distribution which (as seen above) is confined to only four tombs; other rich tombs (219, 283, 285, 292) do not have them. As with other shapes in this style, the very largest140 comes from tomb G. Within the PGB-EG series some development can be seen from globular to ovoid, and from the greater variety of PGB zonal ornament to the more massive and repetitive EG schemes. Three variants occur. G 21, from the workshop of the PGB Tree Painter (cf. the pithos 107.114), has a body resembling a pomegranate,141 achieved by vertical grooving. The swelling on the neck of the carinated 107.142 recalls another oriental model;142 to judge from the lack of a base and the flaring of the lower profile, it is just possible that this was the ornamental knob of a gigantic conical lid even larger than 107.106. The third variant, G 15, is a hybrid form embodying some features of the broad-based Attic MG lekythos-oinochoe (type C (iii)), including the meanders and the chevrons on the handle. Our main series ends with G 93 and 107.129,143 whose sober rectilinear decoration takes us a little way into MG. A more mature MG stage is represented by Teke tholos no. 29, with an Atticizing broad base and dark ground. After a considerable gap 218.83, a much smaller version with slim ovoid body, heralds a revival in EO (O oinochoai type E). E.

This apparent archaism, hardly a time-saving device, may perhaps have some reference to the opium poppy capsule and thereby hint at the original contents of these vessels. (ii) Plain. Incised lines on neck, body undecorated. PGB-EG: Q, io, D 8, 287.30, 292.115; O io, G 138-9 frs.

CRETO-CYPRIOT Globular; large circles on flanks. LG: 60.22 fr. LG-EO: 79.11 fr., 106.16 fr., H 3. The Cypriot model, on which horizontal bands and lines intersect the flanking vertical circles with small circles filling the field, is represented by late eighth century imports of BoR II (e.g. 292.94) and White Painted IV (229.11). Contexts in F.150 indicate that the Knossian development of this shape belongs mainly to the O period (O oinochoai, D (i)). Here, however, our series begins with an exact copy, 60.22, which cannot be appreciably later than the Cypriot originals. Thereafter the Cypriot decoration begins to be modified in various ways: by suppression of the small circles (79.11), by the substitution of 'wheels' (H 3), and by the intrusion of local LG neck ornament on 106.16. The Jug This term embraces all round-mouthed and necked closed pouring vessels with a handle attached at the rim.151 Their functions are even more diverse than those of vessels described as 145 Coldstream in Cyprus and Crete, 257 f. 146 SCE I pl. 137; IV.2, 77 ff. fig. 10.

The first five jugs belong to the globular type used in domestic life as water-pots, as an alternative to the hydria; several have been found at the bottom of a well.152 Decoration and body shape develop along the same lines as the contemporary oinochoai (type A(i)), languettes on the shoulder giving place to semicircles in the course of PG. Likewise 207.57 corresponds to the dark-ground ovoid oinochoe (type A (ii)), and bears careful rectilinear decoration in the manner of the LPG open-necked stirrup jars. B.

Others, like 63.6 and 294.19, are modelled on the broader Attic MG II mug.157 The more normal dotted form with narrower neck, however, is already present in tomb G and in the equally early context of the Archanes house model.158 It remains virtually unchanged in later MG (tombs 125, 106) and LG (218.34, 59) contexts, with remarkably few departures (e.g. 134*7» 294#I1) from the usual three rows of dots.

The earliest, 18.24, carries gridded chevrons from the local PGB-EG stock. PG tradition also survives in the languettes and light ground of 292.98. Otherwise, the decoration is dark-ground with Atticizing reserved panels. For 292.98, and for 104.36 with its unusual strutted handle, there are good parallels in the PGB-EG group from Archanes with the shrine model.161 104.115 bears dotted ornament in the manner of the main body of juglets.

For the former arrangements there are Phoenician precedents;168 but Phoenician feeders, unlike our Q, 49, have strainer holes pierced through the shoulder by an open spout. This version came to Cyprus where we also find counterparts to our feeders with handle opposite the spout, and it appears that from the beginning of Cypro-Geometric III open strainer spouts were superseded by a narrower tubular form169 as found on all our pieces. We need not, then, look beyond Cyprus for the immediate source of this category, and the transmission from the east is unlikely to have occurred before the beginning of Cypro-Geometric III or, in Cretan terms, PGB. The shape of Q, 49, from a PGB deposit, takes with it 134.41 and 242.2; the busy rectilinear ornament of the unusually large 218.54 recalls the PGB 'drinking jar' B 2. The anthropomorphic 106.20 has counterparts from Arkades170 and from an early find at Knossos.171 The Arkades feeder is ovoid and includes a bird in its decoration, but the human elements are similar to ours - including the 'arms' flanking the tubular spout. The Knossian vessel, though lacking the 'arms', is closer to ours in its cylindrical shape, and in its multiple zigzag panel on the shoulder. It was found with an equally extraordinary four-handled pithos on which the ornament includes Hathoric human faces in an otherwise orthodox rectilinear scheme, probably early in LG.172 F. COOKING JUG Coarse, gritty and micaceous orange-red clay; decoration confined to groups of incised lines. These are small versions of cooking shapes found in domestic contexts, albeit mainly in fragmentary form. Most are too small to be anything other than symbolic offerings in the tombs; but two of the larger jugs, 100.8 and G 68, show traces of burning on the rim, and must have been either personal chattels or vessels used at the funerary ceremony. 164 Kanta, 281: 'thelastron'. 165 Ay.

The shape shows a general development from narrow (PG) to broader (LG) bases, continued yet further in EO (292.4, 19). There is also a progressive improvement in the fabric, the content of impurities - especially the mica - becoming much less in the later group. Similar contrasts may be noted between comparable jugs in the use deposit (PG) and the upper fill (LG-EO) in a Knossian well.173 (ii) Tripod feet. H., with feet, 10-15 cm. PG-EG: J 46, 100.9 (plain).

An assumption that their purpose in the tombs was symbolic is supported by the curious composite miniature, Teke tholos no. 109. Our earlier group fills a gap in the domestic sequence, in which no examples have hitherto been recorded between the Minoan prototype174 and LG.175 In the course of our series the fabric is improved in the same ways as for the flat-based jugs; the shape, too, is similar, but consistently broader to accommodate the tripod feet. Broadest of all is 306.18 with horizontal handles: a cauldron (like the Minoan prototype) rather than a jug, but included here for convenience. The Lekythos Here we group all unguent vessels with a round mouth and a tall narrow neck, and a vertical handle attached halfway up the neck.

The idea for such vessels may have come from imports either of Attic LPG (e.g. F. no. 76) or from Phoenician Bichrome vessels like 107.80. The former is the more likely source, since the characteristic neck ridge of the oriental model is not yet imitated, as it was to be in the later typed Long accustomed to capacious unguent vessels, the Knossians made their first lekythoi on the same generous scale as their latest stirrup-jars, with the same ovoid body shape; in this they resemble contemporary oinochoai too (type A (ii)), as also in the semicircle decoration on the shoulder. Other large experimental shapes were tried out in PGB-EG but proved to be still-born: the cylindrical lekythos 104. 17, 177 perhaps based on an earlier Cypriot flask as Brock suggested;178 and a sharply biconical vessel from Anopolis.179 Unique, too, is 75*69, a large globular lekythos combining Atticizing MG decoration with a flaring and ridged lip of oriental appearance. This cannot be much earlier than the emergence of the slim ovoid Praisos type D, and may indicate a continuity - if somewhat tenuous - in the production of large lekythoi at a time when smaller versions predominated. Especially hard to place is 107.130; the shape anticipates the Praisos type, but the spiral motifs seem to be in the PGB spirit180 and the white-on-dark has an experimental look. B.

D 11). In the main PGB group (cf. E nos. 355-6 from tomb OD) the handle is lowered down the neck, but the globular shape remains normal, with low conical foot; sometimes, as in the set from tomb Q,, the body is allowed to sag. The usual decoration corresponds to that of contemporary small oinochoai (type B): wavy line on the neck, and on the shoulder a triangular motif which may be cross-hatched, stacked, or treated as a hatched or gridded chevron. An abnormally large trio from tomb 104, and also 107.160, have instead a careful zigzag on the neck, as does the variant 104.37 w^h a sharp angle near the base (cf. F. no. 371). The other two carinated variants also have equivalents in shape among the oinochoai (e.g. 292.75); 104.24 is a rhyton sprinkler with a pierced disc across the mouth and holes through its foot, and the fr. 175.48 may be from a similar vessel.

These various imitations of oriental shapes and fabrics have been examined elsewhere,183 but in a Cypriot context. Here some attempt will be made to relate them chronologically to the Knossian sequence. This is no easy task, since their decoration, too, follows the eastern models; some dating clues, however, are offered by the contexts. Although the more evolved type (iv) is already well documented in F., our new finds have thrown much interesting light on its more experimental antecedents. (i) Trefoil-lipped. H. 9-1 1 cm.

A curious hybrid, and perhaps the work of a single potter.184 Although the clay is local, the shiny orange surface and the matt grey-black paint argue the influence of Cypriot BoR. All but the last bear circles on the flanks, filled either with Maltese cross or ribbed quatrefoil; these, too, are of Cypriot derivation, but the circles are drawn freehand. The disturbed state of tomb 292 offers little help towards their dating, but their clumsy and experimental look seems to place them with the tomb's early burials. (ii) Close copies of Cypriot types. H. 9-12 cm. Globular body, flat base; round handle, coated. Polished surface. MG: 125.16 fr., 218.41, 219.56. MG-LG: 283.24, 292.202 fr. (Bichrome); 107.201 fr., 175.60 fr. LG: 61. 1, 306.19, 283.83.

Our 283.24 is a close copy of Cypriot Bichrome III.185 On 292.202 the disposition of the circles suggests a two-handled vessel,186 and the thickening of the outer circles is hardly to be expected before period IV in Cyprus, or LG in Cretan terms. For all the other pieces, the frequently imported BoR lekythos (cf. 285.45) supplies the model. Divergences are only minor: flat base instead of the Cypriot ring foot, and the lowering of the thick band from the belly to the base. Slip is rarely added as in Cyprus, and the tone of the surface is usually lighter; but 60.1 and 175.60 even reproduce the deep orange of the originals, and the Cypriot habit of polishing the surface, not usual in Cretan G, is 182 F. i58f. class E. 183 RDAC 1984, 122 ff. 184 Hartley no. 29 (Episkopi) looks similar, but the neck is taller and the circles differently disposed. 185 Cf.

These imitations are close enough to suggest vessels made to order, for the marketing of the same unguent as was bottled in the Cypriot imports. Two alternative types of decoration appear on the Cypriot originals. Our 306.19 follows the rarer scheme, where the belly lines are intersected by large circles on the flanks;187 we shall see more of this scheme on the taller and looser imitations of type (iii). Otherwise the simpler alternative is followed: small sets of circles spaced on the shoulder, and lines round the belly. The earliest contexts, as for the Cypriot imports, are MG.188 Contexts enable us to follow a development in shape: in MG (218.41) the shoulder is well rounded, but becomes flatter in LG (308.19), preparing the way for the biconical and somewhat lumpy profiles of the EO group in tomb 218. (iii) Freer adaptations. Taller, H. up to 17 cm. Ovoid body, round handle. MG: 134.3, 28; 75.43, 294.44. MG-LG: 107.191 fr., 283.84 fr., 229.22, 218.4. EO: 218.15, 16, 88, I2O. The first two unusually combine a Cypriot shape with local MG decoration, cross-hatched triangles and dots on a dark ground. The others are all light-ground and, like type (ii), have their orange surface polished. The G examples follow the Cypriot intersecting scheme,189 but the flanking circles are drawn freehand. As filling ornaments down the front, stacked chevrons (218.4) or small circles may be added, the latter sometimes intruding on the flanks and even on the neck (e.g. 229.22). The large circles on the flanks are abandoned in the EO group, leaving only spaced groups of lines with minimal or no ornament on the shoulder. Like its close counterpart F. no. 453, 75.43 is from a MG context; the body as a plump and rounded ovoid, with flat base. Thereafter the shape becomes attenuated with a straighter lower body, acquiring a ring or disc foot from 218.4 onwards. (iv) Evolved type.190 H. 9-1 1 cm. Globular body, low conical foot; round handle, barred. Solid paint on neck; large circle sets on flanks, various filling ornaments down front and back. Very fine and thin fabric.

In the fully painted neck, the conical foot and the lack of any concern with polishing the surface, these crisply made lekythoi depart from types (i) - (iii) as from the Cypriot models; they follow Cyprus at several removes.191 On the few examples from pre-LG contexts,192 the 187 Cf.

Stacked chevrons were then the favoured filling ornament, as in F.; the cables of 19.20 represent a rare departure. At the transition to EO small circles become more usual than chevrons; occasionally (107.33), as later in EO,193 the handle may rise to the rim, and the neck ridge may be omitted. This type was to become even more popular in EO, the shape developing from globular towards ovoid-conical (O lekythoi type A). D. THE PRAISOS TYPE.194 Tall: H. at least 20 cm. Slim ovoid body, round handle. These elegant vessels are the successors to the large experiments of type A. The first two varieties, with normal dark- and light-ground decoration, run concurrently through MG and LG. A third class, including the eponymous lekythos from Praisos,195 is wholly of EO, bearing rich white-on-dark ornament in the tradition of the Bird workshop (O lekythoi type D). (i) Normal dark-ground technique. Ridge on neck, ring foot. MG, late: 292.116, 231 fr. LG: 19*2, 29 fr. The fr. 292.231 preserves a ridged lip like that of the large globular MG lekythos 75.67, last of the experimental type A. In style - and apparently in profile - it conforms to the more complete 292.116, preserved from base to neck ridge. The Atticizing decoration of this pair, based on a meander with perpendicular hatching, relates them to late MG pithoi like 218.27; the shape matches that of small and slim neck-handled amphorae of this period, type E. A LG example, 19.2, with characteristically restrained decoration confined to the neck, prepares the way for the even more attenuated EO class with white-on-dark ornament and flat base. (ii) Light ground, creamy surface. Minimal or no ridge, round handle with bars, disc or false ring foot. MG: 125.2. LG: 292.89, 106, 192 fr., 193; 218.93; 107.104, 181 fr. LG/EO: 1.9 fr. Made in a wholly non- Atticizing tradition, these lekythoi share the fabric and style of the domed lids, type A (ii). The surface is coated in a thick creamy slip, carefully polished; decoration is arranged in widely spaced thin zones in which a single pointed zigzag plays a leading part. Earliest, from an exclusively MG tomb, is 125.2, bearing on its shoulder a reminiscence of the spiral trees on the figured pithoi of PGB. In LG the decoration becomes even more rarefied, the main shoulder ornament being reduced to a light circular motif (e.g. 292.193), or a floral motif (292.89), or spiral wisps (292.192), or airy stacks of chevron (107.104, 292.106). On 1.9 the strict spacing of the subsidiary zones is breaking up. This type has no O successors. 193 Cf.

Like the lekythos, it was locally evolved in PG before succumbing to foreign influences; but whereas the lekythos came to adopt various Cypriot features, Corinth was the source of any external influences on the aryballos. A. THE JUG-ARYBALLOS197 Local experiments begin well back in PG, with a neck somewhat taller than that of a true aryballos.

MG-LG: 63.4, 229.12 (coated). The first two of these aryballoid vessels are unlikely to have been for unguents, coming as they do from the libation set packed inside the MPG bell-krater 285.82; they are in fact miniatures of PG jugs like O 29. Likewise the dipped pieces, together with F. no. 1038, have larger relations among LPG jugs (e.g. 218.31) and oinochoai, type B (i). The later unpainted and coated vessels are longer-necked variants of true aryballoi which by then had become fully established. (ii) With triangular shoulder motifs. Barred handle. PGB: Q, 11-13, 15-16, 195 25, 28, 30, 32-3, 39, 40, 42; G 108 fr.; 283.79-80 frs.; 65.1 (conical foot). EG: 13-21, G 109 fr., N i fr., 285.4 fr., 283.13 fr., 175.7 fr., M 8. LG: 19.26. Apart from the one LG throwback, these constitute the earliest standardised form of Knossian aryballos. All share a depressed or biconical globular body, and those of PGB combine shoulder triangles with a wavy line on the neck. In these respects they resemble contemporary lekythoi (type B) and small oinochoai (type B (ii)), which also bear a similar variety of triangular motifs on the shoulder. Indeed, the three small closed shapes may not differ much in function at this stage.198 In EG the neck is left plain, and the body below is covered with regular thick bands; fragmentary vessels with such banding have been placed here through analogy with 13.21. In a fully dark-ground form this type survives into a MG context (F. no. 666). 196 Only classes II A-D in F. 157 ff. 197 F. classes II A (i) and (iv), II B (i). i98 218.71 and 116, here placed with lekythoi, are hybrids between lekythoi and aryballoi, the handle being attached to the rim or just below.</page><page sequence="74">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 357 (iii) Miniature.

For 218.103, with its heavier zigzag, a PGB group from near the Villa Ariadne199 offers a close parallel.

Earliest of ail is the curious double-necked vessel F. no. 1017, found with the LPG pithos no. 1016. Then follow Q, 20, 13.8 (handmade in coarse gritty clay) and the two from the EG tomb 286. Another handmade aryballos, 283.8, which occurs in a EG-MG context, has been assigned through laboratory analysis to Corinth, which may also prove to be the origin of the other handmade pieces.201 Indeed, since the Corinthian prototype goes back at least to the early ninth century and resembles F. no. 1017 in breadth of neck and sudden outward flare of lip, it could be that even the beginning of our series may have been influenced by earlier Corinthian imports. Local preference, however, was always for wheel-made versions.202 From EG onwards the development in the body shape is not at all consistent; although there is a general change from depressed globular towards a more truly globular shape with tapering lower body, both shapes occur side by side in tomb 286, while depressed globular profiles persist even into LG-EO contexts (75.127, 129). Perhaps the shaping of mouth and neck offers a surer guide to dating; until MG the mouth flares, but from LG the neck becomes straighter and is crowned by a disc mouth with sharply everted lip, resembling the Corinthian globular aryballos of EPC.

The foreign model for this standard dark-ground type is represented by the Corinthian MG II import F. no. 668. In the local repertoire it persists from MG into O, long after it had been superseded in Corinth, and without much change; what little development there is mirrors that of the unpainted aryballoi, type B. Like the Corinthian prototype,204 the most usual body profile is depressed globular, persevering even into the EO context of F. no. 882; but from LG onwards a fully globular shape may occur. More consistent, once again, is the change from a flaring mouth (MG into LG) to a disc mouth upon a straighter neck, from LG onwards. Many of these pieces are in a deep orange-brown clay, darker than what is normal for Knossian fine painted ware; but, unlike F. no. 668, there is no good reason to suspect that they may be imports. D. WITH OTHER MOTIFS EG(?): 175.3 fr. MG: 218.7. LG-EO: 292.73, F/67: 4.11. Within G, alternatives to cross-hatched triangles are rare. The vertical cables of 175.3 suggest EG, and the string-mark under the base has the look of an early experiment. 218.7, with a filled zigzag, seems to be with a MG pithos, 218.9. Exceptional care went into the decoration of 292.73, with its delightfully varied birds; the flying creatures cannot be far in time from the similar bird on the large LG-EO cup 134.47. Thus far, the dark-ground scheme has prevailed. At some time late in LG, however, a wholly light-ground aryballos was coming into fashion, borrowing its shoulder motifs from various stages of the Creto-Cypriot lekythos. One of the rarer motifs is the irregular swastika of F/67: 4. 11; compare the lekythos 218.15. Commonest of all are the small double circles derived from close imitations of Cypriot BoR imports (lekythoi type C (ii)).205 Although several of these circle aryballoi have occurred in other cemeteries with LG pithoi,206 none among our finds is clearly associated with any context before EO; they are therefore all listed under O aryballoi type C (ii), even though some pieces without clear associations may go back to LG. The same is true of light-ground aryballoi with grouped lines only,207 also occurring elsewhere in some LG contexts,208 but here the earliest association is with the very late LG pithos 104.3. E.

Some are locally evolved, others influenced by Attic and perhaps Cypriot imports. The prevailing form is globular, but we begin with an early straight-sided type with a Minoan ancestry. A. STRAIGHT-SIDED2»' Low vertical neck or collar, two horizontal handles attached to carination, flat base. E-MPG: J 9, J 13, 285.125, 100.23 fr&gt; 207.61. LPG-PGB: 287.12; 294*43 fr., (coarse). The shape develops steadily from LM III B and C,212 through a profusely decorated SM piece,213 towards the four EPG examples from E tombs VI and XI,214 the body becoming progressively taller and slimmer. Thus far, the wall below the carination has been vertical or nearly so; but our earliest group indicates a slightly later development when the lower body begins to taper, as on another EPG example from Teke.215 The decoration is always light and simple, virtually confined to single floating zigzags or wavy lines. Later members of this series are F. nos. 227 (MPG) and 286, 290 (LPG), where the carination is softened and the shape moves towards the necked globular form, type B (v). From this sequence 287.12 stands apart, with rich decoration varied from side to side. Its broad shape, with rising loop handles reaching halfway down the profile, returns to the LM III B prototype.216 Alone of this type it possesses a lid, for which the lip is carefully inset. The pyxis is, in fact, a miniature of the straight-sided pithos in its earliest and broadest form, as seen in D 12. The nearest contemporary equivalent to the shape is Payne no. 165 bis (LPG), with pendent semicircles on the body but a more vertical lip. B. GLOBULAR The earliest type, with everted lip and no handles, was made under the influence of mainland LPG. Handles might be added later in PG, and the original ring foot might be replaced by a flat base. The usual G form, always with handles, abandons the everted lip for a low vertical neck or collar, recalling type A. In a final category we consider various experiments with a lip inset for a lid, never a popular alternative in Crete. Apart from this last category, only those without handles are normally equipped with lids (here the lids are treated in a subsequent section). Sometimes there are also holes for suspension, pierced though both lip and lid, for tying on the lid as well as for suspension; or through the lip only, for suspending the body only. For handled pyxides, which could easily be suspended by a cord looped through the handles, such holes would not have been needed.217 210 For her valuable advice on this shape I thank Dr. Barbara Bohen. 211 F. 161 f., 'straight-sided jar' class A. 212 Kama, 281 ff pls. q6.q (LM III b), ^4.4-c (LM III c). 213 UM II pl. 49.a-b, from under the Stratigraphical Museum. 214 F. nos. 42, ^2, 77, 163. 215 BSA 58 (1963) 37 no. 4 fig. 8. 216 Kanta, pl. 96, 9. 217 1 owe this observation to Dr. B.

These pyxides are based on the mainland LPG handleless prototype, represented at Knossos by both Attic218 and Corinthian (285.134, 138) imports. At the head of the local versions stands Payne no. 166 which, like the Attic original,219 bears a broad zone of reserved decoration round the belly. Then follow L 1-2 and F. no. 1470, with groups of reserved lines only.220 On our two latest pieces a conical foot is added, a short-lived experiment; more important is the raising of the decorated zone to the shoulder, where it usually remains henceforth. (ii) Without handles: flat base. Everted lip, as for (i). Dark ground. PGB: 100.34, 287.26, 285.2. EG: G 52, N 4, 175.66. This type does not occur in the F. tombs. Our examples are preceded by three earlier pyxides, all of which still have the full globular shape of type (i). One, from Archanes,221 is decorated with PGB mill-sail. The other two, with bands and lines only, are Ay. Ioannis I. 57 (LPG?) and Teke tholos no. 57, a receptacle for jewellery belonging to the first (PGB) burial.222 Thereafter, in our pieces, the shape becomes shallower and the centre of gravity lower. 285.2, with its single zigzag zone, is a smaller edition of a pyxis from Arkades;223 175.66, with reserved lines only, exactly parallels a pyxis in Groningen, confirming Desborough's attribution of that vessel to Crete.224 (iii) With handles and ring foot. Everted lip. Mainly dark ground. LPG: 285.69, 285.122, 287.19, 219.28, D 25. PGB: Nu, 0,9«- PGB-EG: G 53. Another way of modifying the Attic PG prototype to local taste was to add two horizontal handles rising from the shoulder. The shape, however, remains fully globular until the depressed globular pyxis G 53 at the end of this series.225 For the smaller pieces (e.g. 287.19, 219.28) the foot may be low conical rather than ring. Neat triangular decoration, as on F no. 529, prevails on the LPG examples. The large PGB pyxis Q, 98 closely matches F. no. 1436 in its body shape and its gridded zigzag; but the F. piece, unusually, has lug handles, and also a flat lid unlikely to have been made for it.

The Atticizing everted lip first becomes established in F. no. 246 from the M-LPG tomb III. Thereafter the shape is standardised in LPG and PGB, with a very short everted lip and predominantly semicircular decoration;226 in PGB the semicircles are sometimes allowed to intersect, as on D 26-8. As usual, the profile moves from truly globular to depressed globular. The dotted triangles of N 37 recall F no. 361 from tomb OD. (v) With handles, flat base and low neck. Dark ground. EG: 13*31» i3*33j i75*24; 218.20 (coarse, incised). MG: 292.77, 2i8.8. 218.104, 218.114 (miniatures). LG: 18.28, 75.148 fr., 175.35, 75-45b* LG/EO: 107.69, 19.22; 218.38 (miniature). As we have seen, the later and smaller pyxides of the PG straight-sided type A (e.g. F. no. 286) prepare the way for the introduction of this normal G form, which may also owe something to Cypriot BoR imports like F. no. 1451. The EG pair from tomb 13 are clumsy and unusually large experiments; the fabric and disc foot of the coarse pyxis 218.20 relate it to the small ribbed oinochoai of Cypriot derivation, type E. In MG the shape settles down to a modest size (height 7-10 cm) with compact globular body, broad neck and flat base; decoration is restricted to a single zigzag in the reserved panel between handles.227 The LG pieces are less homogeneous, but the general tendency is towards a taller and/or narrower neck, sometimes taking lines instead of, as before, solid paint (75.148, 107.69). This version lasts into EO (61.2) and may be affected by the revival of the necked pithos. Altogether different is the miniature 218.39, combining white-on-dark bands and lines (cf. F. no. 733) with a dumpy shape, vestigial neck, and lug handles of prehistoric appearance. (vi) With lip inset for lid. Various.

Like most Attic G types, the three earliest pieces are handleless, and their inset lips may well have been derived from imported Attic MG I flat and pointed pyxides (e.g. 292.42, 283.46) with which they coincide in time.

The idea is not likely to have come from the EG-MG types of the Argolid,229 a region only rarely in touch with Knossos at this time. Perhaps a more plausible source would have been the chance rediscovery of Early Minoan lugged pyxides,230 which also have the depressed globular shape prevailing among our pieces. The LO bucchero pyxis 107.78 may owe a similar debt to the remote past. Some pyxides of MG and LG, like F. no. 749, obviously follow the shape of the neckless ovoid pithos-urns. Among them is 306.13, a fine piece from the Bird Workshop, large enough to have been used as an urn. C. flat With lid. PGB: 0,44. PGB-EG(?): 283.51, 283.58, (coarse with incised decoration). Apart from the meander of Q, 44, these experimental rarities have nothing in common with the imported Attic flat pyxis. Once again, inspiration from the remote past may be suspected: 285.51, with its lid 75, recalls the Early Minoan lugged cylindrical pyxis.231 The high vertical flange of Q, 44 is without parallel; the copious decoration of this pyxis, with its strange combination of meander and rosette, is very much in the PGB spirit. The Small Lid Like the larger lids associated with pithoi, these divide into two basic types, conical and domed. The former are almost always designed to fit globular pyxides; the latter, rarely so. Lids found on pyxides, or obviously fitting a pyxis in the same tomb, are marked with an asterisk. A. CONICAL (i) With plain knobs, inverted conical D. usually 9-1 1 cm. M-LPG: K 2*, L ia*.

Sometimes (207.16, 283.71-3) the knob may be cylindrical rather than conical. Later lids are shallower, with solid knobs. Decoration rarely extends beyond reserved lines on a dark ground; 285.135 and 287.12a carry PG triangular motifs, while 1.4 (leaves) and 292.180 (white-on-dark circles) borrow normal motifs of pithos lids. (ii) With ornamental knobs PGB: 219.72, 285.1*, 28.14*, G 89*, 100.19. MG: 75-83&gt; 75-"9&gt; IO7-93&gt; 63-3a*- The PGB warrior's head on 219.72 is unique, but the helmet233 crowning the lid of an Attic MG II pyxis-pithos234 may express a similar thought. Our lid is too large to have fitted the only PGB pyxis found in the tomb (219.28) which in any case is of the handled variety usually without a lid; but the pair of holes on one side of the rim only would allow suspension on a wall. The warrior's face, enlivened by dots and dabs of paint on the features, displays the same delight in miniature modelling as the small rider on the contemporary askos Q, 115. Of actual Cretan helmets at this time we know nothing, and it would be foolish to deduce their precise shape from this very simplified rendering; but a ridged crest seems to be intended, of a kind which is matched on other objects that have been plausibly dated to this period - for example, the gold band from the Teke tholos tomb,235 and the warrior between two women on the belt F. no. 1568. This form of crest, running directly over the crown of a fairly simple helmet without cheek-pieces, is also well attested in Near Eastern art.236 The triangular ornament might suggest openwork bronze attached to a leather cap, as on the upper helmet attachment in an eleventh-century grave at Tiryns.237 On another PGB lid, 285.1, a freely modelled bird is poised for flight. The head is missing, but the stylisation of fan tail and outstretched wings is exactly as on two terracotta figurines of Cypro-Geometric II;238 and similar bird figurines, though with dark-ground decoration, are known from MG Naxos and Attica.239 On 63.3a, again, part of the knob is broken off, but the irregular portion which survives resembles a bird's tail. The other pieces are small versions of the conical pithos lids of type B, with knobs in the form of conical finials240 (G 87, 107.93) or of miniature vessels with flat tops; the miniatures, appropriately, are of pyxides. On 75.83 the stem below is ribbed, like MG pithos lids of type C. To judge from 28.14 and G 89, these lids were for globular pyxides with inset rims, type B (vi); but only 28.14 has the full complement of two pairs of holes for tying on the lid. 232 Attic: 219.69.

The others are smaller (D. 9-10 cm), and have in common the non-Attic MG billet motif round the narrow everted lip. M 2 belongs to the lugged pyxis M 13, with tying holes to match; 48.12 is very similar, in decoration as in its flat top. The homogeneous set of nine from tomb 134,241 apparently wholly without pyxides, are miniatures of the low-domed shield lid, for wall suspension through holes only on one side. Unparalleled in E, they carry a rich and predominantly non-Atticizing repertoire of motifs towards the end of MG: billets, dots, triangles, solid leaves with outline, and large central rosettes.

Latest of all, perhaps, is 1.7, with continuous lines but a slightly everted lip, from a tomb containing nothing earlier than MG. These lids have sometimes been published as bowls,243 but the lack of interior paint and the holes near the rim make this diagnosis unlikely. None, however, is associated with a pyxis, and most have only a single hole for suspension. The Ring Kernos LPG: 285.68. This libation vessel could be filled through any of its miniature vase attachments, but the only egress is through the central bird's mouth. The gridded zigzag, combined with the light- ground neck-handled amphorae and kalathos, argues a LPG date. This particular form of kernos, where miniature vessels and protomes or figurines are attached to a ring body, is otherwise known in Crete only from a badly worn piece from Kourtes,244 carrying three human figurines and six belly-handled amphorae of SM-PG appearance. In Cyprus, however, the type goes back to the beginning of the Iron Age and has a prehistoric past.245 An important feature of the Cypriot model is the basket handle passing across the ring. The nearest Cypriot equivalent to our piece is an approximately contemporary BoR I kernos in the Piérides collection,246 where two amphorae and two bird askoi are perched on the ring. There the birds' wings are modelled, whereas on ours the plumage is suggested by a gridded zigzag. As on our birds, however, the one surviving head has short animal ears in relief, and a rounded animal muzzle for the spout - a more effective aid to smooth pouring than any realistically modelled mouth in the form of a bird's beak. The Lentoid Flask LPG: 285.30, 219.16 (modelled bird). LPG-PGB: 75.71, 100.21. PGB-EG: 75.200. Another shape of oriental origin, sporadically imitated in the Aegean at different periods of the Early Iron Age.247 In Cyprus, flattened lentoid 'bottles'248 have two handles attached to the neck; single-handled Cypriot flasks249 tend more towards the globular, like most PG imitations from Lefkandi.250 Our earliest flasks, then, represent a Knossian adaptation of a Levantine form, arising at about the same time as the first large lekythoi, type A; F. no. 312, from the LPG tomb L, is contemporary with them. The awkwardly placed bird on 219.16, with its circled eye, animal ears and animal mouth, is even closer than the birds of our kernos (285.68) to the creature on the BoR kernos in the Piérides collection, mentioned in the 243 Mariani, AJA 5 (1901) 313, no. 17, pl. 9; Payne, BSA 29 (1927-28) 260, on his nos. 141-2. 244 Xanthoudides, BSA 12 (1905-06) 16 fig. 3; Arkades fig. 6^1; Ann. 66-67 (iq88-8q) 254, fier. 223. 245 A.

On 100.21 the handle is carried up to a trefoil lip as on Attic LPG versions,251 but a direct connection is chronologically unlikely. Our latest piece, 75.200, has a flat disc on each flank, slightly raised.252 The decoration, previously dominated by massed concentric circles, here admits a profusion of freehand PGB-EG motifs - double arcs and running spirals on one side, small spirals on the other. The Bird Askos LPG: 219.12 (double), 285.136, 219.1 fr. PGB: Q 115 (with rider), Q, 114 fr., 13.10 fr., 104.22 fr. EG: G ni fr. Dark Age vessels with bird-like bodies were classified by Desborough253 into two types. His Type II, where the position of the bird head is occupied by a round spout, is represented in Crete by several SM examples. Latest of all is F. no. 50 (E-MPG), ca poor object both in modelling and decoration, and it may be the last survivor of a shape that had gone out of fashion'.254 Cretan potters then made a fresh start with Desborough's Type la, distinguished by a bird head at the front end and a spout behind, resting on three legs. First evolved in twelfth- century Cyprus, this model had been made in Achaea and Naxos in LH III C, and in Athens and Lefkandi during SM. Then, long after it had been forgotten elsewhere in the Aegean world, it enters the Knossian repertoire in LPG. One can only conclude, with Desborough,255 that its arrival in Crete must 'surely represent a clear influence from Cyprus from the ninth century onwards', since only Cyprus offers a continuous series of these askoi throughout the Early Iron Age.256 At once the Cypriot model was transformed and enlivened by local imagination. The painted decoration is always drawn from the current Knossian stock, and provides useful clues for dating. One of the earliest, 219.12, is a double askos with a dual purpose: one mouth is open for pouring, the other is pierced for sprinkling. In sympathy with the round open mouth - as on the ring kernos 285.68 and the lentoid flask 219.16 - the protomes are more animal than bird. Painted details include eyelashes, caps, wavy locks of hair, and a suggestion of harness. Between the two backs, the broken attachment may have been for a small rider, as for Q, 115. Unlike the Cypriot prototype, the filling spout is kept well clear of the basket handle and placed on the tail. On a contemporary piece, F. no. 277 from tomb L, the spout takes the form of a miniature vessel, a hydria - perhaps, as Brock suggested,257 after the example of the ring kernos. The sadly fragmentary 219.1, decorated with neat rectilinear LPG ornament, preserves traces of a miniature cup perhaps attached to the tail, and also of a fledgling upon the parent's back.258 The body of 285.136 is bird-like only when viewed from above; otherwise it is a quadruped with animal tail and sharply modelled equine mane, 251 Kerameikos IV pl. 25 no. 2034; Hesperia 30 (1961) 163 pl. 28 no. 35. 252 Cf.

Here we have a reminiscence of another theriomorphic type of LH III C, a beast of burden loaded with pottery vessels.259 This curious horse-bird hybrid prepares us for the masterpiece Q, 115, a real tour-de-force of PGB exuberance. The spout on the tail takes the form of a finely modelled miniature oinochoe covered with various motifs, among which the combs and the 'eye' below the rim both look towards Cyprus. Down the front of the neck is an oriental Tree of Life, one of the earliest in Greek vase painting.260 Upon the shoulder, on each side, a clump of small trees grow out of a hatched square, perhaps representing a sacred grove or enclosure. Scattered over the body, among various rectilinear patterns, are a serpent, two fish and numerous quartered sun-discs, evidently more than mere decoration;261 also a solid square, mysteriously surrounded by single zigzags. One suspects some connection with the imagery of the PGB Tree painter, especially with the scenes on his Goddess pithos 107. 114« On the bird body, sickle-shaped wings are modelled in relief, exactly as on a LM III a bird askos from Nirou Khani.262 Otherwise the creature is wholly animal. The three legs are carefully jointed, an equine mane is added to the tall vertical neck, and the painted detail includes a more explicit rendering of harness than on 219.12. The horse protome prompts the addition of a diminutive rider, precariously perched in front of the basket handle. Although less than two centimetres high, his hair and dress are painted in meticulous detail; but his face registers extreme bewilderment at this strange form of transport. This sort of creature would become known to later Greeks as a xouthos hippalektryon,263 but we have to wait until sixth-century Attic Black Figure vase-painting for any more renderings in art.264 Too little survives of the other PGB pieces to require much comment. The charming fr. 13.10, with mill-sail down its body, preserves a sinuous duck-like neck, and a long spout suggestive of a stork's beak; a slight inclination of the head adds to its vivacious expression. The other two frs. are horse-like hybrids like Q, 115. The body plumage of Q, 114 is rendered by columns of oblique bars, and the tail bears traces of a miniature vessel; an askos from Kourtes265 matches both these features, and also the modelling of the horse-bird spout. On 104.22, in creamy fabric, a tall strainer filling spout is placed on the back, still in the Cypriot manner. The body fr. G in, decorated with a rough meander below the oblique plumage, attests the survival of this type at least into EG; but no later G examples are known266 before an O revival, often in a much more naturalistic and purely birdlike form. From the fragments it is clear that the bodies of these askoi were made on the wheel, and then squashed into bird shape; Q, 114 shows that the original rim need not always be joined at the bird's back. The other parts were shaped by hand and then attached to the body. 259 E.g. Ann. 13-14 (1930-31) 293 f. fig. 39 pl. 22. Euboean SubPG: AR 31 (1985), 16 fig. 22.

The largest fr. has a sharp carination, separating the upper wall from the sloping roof of a round house model. The neat triangles and pendent semicircles are in the manner of the LPG open-necked stirrup-jars. From a mid-ninth century deposit above the Unexplored Mansion came a better preserved portion of another such model,267 with very similar decoration, and preserving part of the doorway as well as a central aperture in the roof. The two pieces will thus be a generation older than the much-discussed PGB model from Archanes.268 The Fenestrated Stand PGB-EG(?): 283.98, This cylindrical stand, made of coarse and gritty red-brown clay, has a concave ring top reminiscent of Cypriot bronze stands, and two rectangular windows carried up to the rim. Teke tholos nos. 105-07 are smaller and slimmer versions of this type, but with triangular windows some way down the wall. It has been suggested269 that those stands go with other vessels of eastern character, offered with the initial burial there of a resident oriental goldsmith. The Krater Tall bell kraters are the most usual form throughout PG. They sometimes contain burials,270 but more often serve funerary libations. When found undisturbed, they may contain sets of drinking and pouring vessels for the funeral party.271 Imitations of bronze cauldrons begin to appear late in PG, in coarse ware at first, and then (PGB-EG) in looser painted adaptations. Meanwhile, Attic types had been sporadically attempted from MPG onwards, first with PG conical feet, then with EG-MG ribbed pedestal, and later with low base. All three types occur also in domestic contexts. A. PG BELL KRATERS272 Light ground decoration, spatter inside.

H. 25 cm); but the height is at least equal to the rim diameter. The interior is usually275 coated but for reservation just below the rim and on the floor. The change to EPG is announced by three kraters from the same hand: F. nos. 166 and 168 from tomb XI, and our 285.60. The shape has suddenly grown larger and taller, and from now on the earlier interior coating is replaced by spatter below a rim band. Smaller pieces like 56.6 (still coated inside) and 175.25 develop a high conical foot, already adumbrated by the Kollyva Metochi krater. For larger vessels a sturdy ring foot is normal. The decoration is slow to abandon SM habits. The horizontal S's of 56.6 recall the large SM bell skyphos F. no. 11. On the group of 285.60 antithetic spirals are inherited from Late Minoan III C, here flanking a primitive double-chevron 'tree'; this we see again on the amphoriskos 285.114, possibly from the same libation set. Various kinds of fringe survive from the older repertoire, either as oblique bars or as single zigzags (both on 175.25, side B) or as wavy lines.276 Eventually compass-drawn circles arrive, usually flanking a central rectilinear column (K 1) as on the frequently imported Attic LPG skyphoi (e.g. J 50). Knowledge of this scheme is apparent on side A of 175.25, even though the circles are single and freehand. With the Attic-inspired circles come various solid central fillings, only hourglasses at first,277 then Maltese crosses a little later.278 (ii) Flat rim, ridge below. Broad band on lip, bars on rim.

From MPG onwards, as on the belly-handled amphorae, a strengthening ridge is added below the rim, an essential precaution especially for the largest vessels which attain a height of 50 cm.279 From this ridge the concave lip splays outwards more and more towards the end of the series. On the whole, the shape becomes a little broader than in the previous group. The now orthodox sets of concentric circles nearly always enclose some central filling motif - an hourglass, or a St. George cross (F 1, 28.11), or a Maltese cross, or a six-spoked wheel (283.54). The central rectilinear panel280 may contain elaborate accumulations of small motifs, often with minor variations from side to side. Fringes still survive here and there from the older repertoire, either as oblique bars (48.7) or as zigzags (175.26) or as chevron columns J 65). Some LPG kraters - D 19, 100.36 and Ay.

COLDSTREAM two sets of circles are linked by narrow horizontal strips of rectilinear ornament. The neatly latticed triangles of 100.36 are in the manner of the open-necked stirrup-jars. The decoration of the latest kraters shows signs of restlessness, with the intrusion of new motifs in PGB: the mill-sail (285.54; 28.11 within a gridded lozenge), cable (F. no. 712) and hatched meander (M 10). The filling of the circles on the last piece consists of outline rosettes derived from oriental jewellery.281 On the very largest scale of 100.44 and 283.54, narrow motifs may be inserted within the sets of circles - as on contemporary or slightly later belly- handled amphorae like G 5. In contrast to all these novelties, three kraters offer a remarkable example of PGB antiquarianism: on 100.44, ^ *7 and Payne no. 4 the antithetic spirals of Late Minoan III C are recreated in geometricized form by harnessing the circles to the upper frame by curved tangents, themselves bound to the central panel by various forms of hatching. Amazing departures from the usual circle compositions are seen in the figured work on E 3 and F i. For E 3, Sacke tt282 has reasonably suggested a LPG date, based on a stratigraphical inference that all ten vases recovered from this largely destroyed tomb form a single burial group; the lekythos E 2 can hardly be any earlier, the circle amphora E 1 is unlikely to be later, and both the broad bell-skyphoi (E 4-5, 7-9) and the dipped cups (E 6, 10) are at home in LPG. Very similar bell-skyphoi, F 3-4, were found with F 1 in a much disturbed and plundered tomb together with the remains of a coarse pithos, F 2, of a type normally used for PG cremations. If the association is sound, then F 1 will have served as a libation krater and, to judge from the accompanying bell-skyphoi, the burials associated with both figured kraters will have taken place within the same phase. Two other considerations, however, suggest a slightly earlier date for the manufacture of F i. First, its shape is very close to that of 285.82, containing an undisturbed libation set of MPG appearance: deeper bell-skyphoi283 and pouring vessels still in a wholly light-ground manner.284 In the decoration of that krater the latest feature is the gridded zigzag,285 which adumbrates the rectilinear repertoire of LPG. On F 1, however, the elaborately varied central panels are compounded wholly of rectilinear motifs derived from the older Attic PG repertoire - panels of checkerboard and latticing, latticed lozenge column, and solid hourglasses (which serve as circle fillings on 285.82). The most likely date, then, for F 1 is late in MPG,286 when it may have been put to use in daily life for some years before its eventual deposition with drinking vessels of the subsequent phase. The agrimi goat, which had already appeared in isolation on two earlier Knossian PG vessels,287 here becomes the prey of hunters in the first of all extended scenes288 in Greek Iron Age vase-painting. The figures float in the field above the conventional circles, but were not added as an afterthought; the placing of the circles on both sides is deliberately asymmetrical, to leave deep enough spaces for the two human hunters above the left-hand sets. On the reverse side a solitary hunter with his square net faces out of the picture, but completes the scene on the front side. The whole composition, then, consists of two hunters, spears poised, 281 Cf. K. R.

To the left, a wild goat has been hit by a spear and totters to the ground; on the right, a large hound pursues a bird and a young deer. In the strictly triangular rendering of the thorax, these hunters forestall the work of the Athenian Dipylon Master by over a century. It is easy to envisage how the figures may have been developed from the solid hourglasses in the rectilinear panel,289 but the dress also recalls the triangular fringed tunics of LH III C pictorial vase-painting,290 and the zigzag reservation above may indicate some kind of non-metallic body armour. The idea for such a scene could have been inspired by the rediscovery of a Minoan pictorial larnax in a reused chamber tomb; a LM III B larnax from Armenoi291 presents a similar scene, though in a much freer composition. The spare and sketchy silhouette animals of F i follow on naturally after the EPG goats of E no. 45, but in no way prepare us for the much more massive and rounded LPG creatures of E 3, Free use is made there of latticing and outline drawing, and some parallels have been noted with pictorial work of LH III C;292 and yet Aegean Bronze Age tradition offers no precedents for the iconography of the two scenes. On one side the winged heraldic sphinxes wear conical caps of Near Eastern character, as on the later bronze quiver F. no. 1569, and in contrast to the flat polos of the Aegean Bronze Age;293 and we now know that a Near Eastern embossed bronze bowl showing sphinxes of similar build had already reached another part of the Aegean world by 900 BC.294 On the front side of E 3 an armed warrior struggles desperately against two lions. In the Greek world this theme is not seen again until the second quarter of the eighth century,295 and thereafter occur several times in LG art.296 The question arises: whence could a Knossian LPG vase-painter, a century earlier than any of these representations, have derived his own inspiration for such a scene? Not, surely, from Aegean Bronze Age precedent; a Mycenaean hero is never outnumbered by lions, and never shown at such an obvious disadvantage. In the light of recent discoveries at Lefkandi, the date is not impossibly early for a view of contemporary figured work imported to the Aegean from the Near East.297 Nevertheless, known representations of a man struggling against two lions are rare, confined in earlier art to a cylinder seal298 and a four-sided openwork bronze stand,299 both of the Late Cypriot Bronze Age; and it so happens that both types of Cypriot artefact have indeed been found in Crete, sometimes in contexts of the Dark Age or even later,300 no doubt after having been treasured as heirlooms. In addition to the Minoan pictorial larnakes, then, it seems that by LPG an alternative, eastern, source of ideas may also have been attracting the attention of vase- painters bold enough to experiment with figured scenes. 289 Cf. the goddesses on the PGB amphora F. no. 339, and the crude figures on an amphoriskos from Adhromyloi, BSA 12 (1905-06) 47 fig. 24. 280 Karageorghis and Vermeule, Mycenaean Pictorial Vase Painting 130 ff, esp.

CAULDRONS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES (i) Coarse: small imitations of bronze tripod cauldrons. Micaceous red clay. LPG(?): 100.3. PGB-EG: 65.4 fr., 65.5 fr., G 141. A shallow bronze tripod cauldron with solid legs has been reported from a tomb excavated at Teke,303 but for published comparanda we must rely on the full sequence from Olympia. Our almost complete specimen, 100.3, ls based on the earliest class represented at Olympia. This is distinguished by the massive sections of the ring handles and especially the legs, long before the enlargement of the tripod cauldron led to a saving of bronze by flattening the handles and hollowing out the legs. Earlier PG imitations of this class in clay are known, two from Athens and one from Acarnania,304 with equally massive legs, and also struts joining the legs to the base of the bowl. In two respects 100.3 ls even more faithful to the bronze original. Whereas on the other three vessels the legs are attached to the lower body, on our piece they join the rim305 - the result is a perilously fragile vase, because of the extreme contrast between the heavy legs and the surprisingly thin upper profile. Again, as in no other clay imitations elsewhere, there is even some effort to copy the exterior vertical grooving of the early massive bronze legs, as seen at a stage well before any obvious concern for saving metal.306 This cauldron was found on the dromos floor with the LPG amphora ioo.i, both vessels perhaps having been moved from their original position; but whether or not the association is sound, the overall ninth-century context of T. 100 is consistent with the dating of the massive class implied in the most recent study of the Olympian corpus.307 Other features of the massive class at Olympia are echoed in the frs. 65.4 and 5.

In other respects, however, the bronze prototypes are modified under ceramic influence. Foreign to the bronze cauldrons is the flat base of 65.4, and on both pieces the incised lines below the rim are more in keeping with coarse pithos ware than with metal. Finally, G 141 omits the ring handles, and the accompanying straps are replaced by vertical lugs. The legs are flattened, and the body profile becomes a hybrid between a cauldron and a domestic basin.310 (ii) Coarse: large cauldrons with vertical handles. Spreading upper attachments. Gritty orange-brown clay. LPG-PGB: 287.15, 175.22, 285.79. T. 175 was found in a thoroughly disturbed state, but the first and last vessels were found to contain adult male cremations, like some of their later bronze counterparts.311 Nearest to bronze is 287.15; the profile is that of the handleless and sharply carinated cauldron 285^26, but with the base flattened. But the closest counterpart in bronze is a vessel of uncertain date from the Tiryns treasure,312 with a triple-reeded handle passing from below the carination to a long plate attached outside the rim; here the plate is detached from the lip and projects level with the rim. On 175.22, deeper and more rounded, the carination has been eliminated; the rim attachments are now metal-like spools, which also appear on 285.79. On this heavy and unwieldy vessel the upper attachments retreat down to the shoulder, and the ubiquitous zones of oblique bars are the improvisation of the local potter, long accustomed to incised patterns on his coarse pithoi; and yet the striations down the handles are still in the manner of the cauldron from the Tiryns Treasure. No comparable vessel occurs in E, but no. 67 there (EPG) may be an early painted counterpart to this type of vessel, and a precursor of the next type.

Both types are given a flat base, and diverge even further from their bronze models in adopting the level horizontal handles customary for domestic bowls (cf. G 141). The handles are usually round, but may be flattened at the end of the series.313 They often assume a reflex form, their ends rebounding from the wall. The grooved base (G 39, 42, 45, 117) is an interesting variant, found also under some contemporary oinochoai of Attic MG I.314 Apart from some of the carinated examples (e.g. G 114) these vessels are usually shallower than the Atticizing flat-based kraters (type C (iii)) which succeed them. The rounded versions, with their offset concave lips, may sometimes approach quite near (e.g. G 118) to the Attic shape. The decoration, however, draws exclusively on non-Attic motifs, arranged in one or more narrow zones. Commonest are small sets of standing or pendent semicircles, pendent arcs and running spiral; other alternatives are solid triangles (L 15, G 42), gridded ladders (G 114), outline battlement (G 45), broad single zigzag (G 117) and oblique bars (G 46, 75.207, 219.81). A concentration of these kraters in the rich tomb G implies that they were not necessarily regarded as the poor man's substitute for a bronze cauldron. They do, however, regularly occur in domestic contexts315 as well as in tombs. C. MAINLAND TYPES (i) With high conical foot Overhanging rim, concave lip, ridge below. Bucranium handles. MPG: 175.28, 175.27, 100.41 fr. PGB: 100.45 fr-&gt; IOO-55 fr&gt; D 13, N 2 fr. The usual Attic PG scheme of decoration, circles flanking a rectilinear panel, had already appeared on some EPG bell-kraters. Within MPG, and before the passing of Attic PG, a similar composition is seen on the two kraters from T. 175, Atticizing not only in decoration but also in their hemispherical body shape upon a high conical foot. Their closest counterparts come not from Athens itself, but from an Atticizing sequence near another limit of the Greek world, at Marmariani316 in Northern Thessaly. From MPG onwards, throughout the ninth century, this Atticizing high-footed type continues as an alternative to the more popular bell-krater. The fully coated F. no. 1481 is from a LPG context. Brock, supposing a local Atticizing krater 'unthinkable'317 at such an early date, presumed it to be an import; but the grounds for his supposition are now removed by I75-27-8- In PGB the frs. 100.45 and 55 (the former with the vast rim diameter of c. 50 cm) continue the earlier PG scheme of decoration, the circles being interlaced with bars or billets in the manner of the contemporary bell-kraters 283.54 and 100.44. Ay. Ioannis offers an imaginative variant of this scheme, in which the circles are horizontally bisected and displaced to become concentric 'waves' as a setting for long-tailed water-birds in silhouette.

Our last two pieces, also with a dark ground below, abandon circles altogether for the new rectilinear ornament; the shape is now a simplified version of the Attic type I, already used in Athens for impressive grave monuments.318 D 13, covered with a profusion of solid triangles in narrow zones, cautiously admits the Attic hatched meander on one side only.319 N 2, similar in body shape (the foot is missing) but much coarser in fabric and style, marshals together in a single broad zone an ill-assorted collection of laddered battlements, lozenge columns with various fillings, and large rectangles with checked frame, of local rather than Attic character; alone of this group, its interior is not coated like Attic prototypes, but spattered like the bell-kraters.

This shape is based on the Attic type II,320 well represented among imports to Knossos.321 The local versions at once adopt the stirrup handles and the splaying pedestal with ribs on the stem; but our two EG examples still keep the overhanging rim and ridge of type I, before the short offset lip of type II is eventually accepted from 75.117 onwards. In the handles, the horizontal members take the bucranium form only on the very largest kraters (G 80, 75.117) and, somewhat incongruously, on the finely made miniature 125.6 where they appear disproportionately large. After the Attic type II models, the reserved decoration is usually grouped round a dominant central meander.322 A flamboyant exception is G 80 which combines Atticizing with local PGB-EG decoration on what is by far the largest (H. 69 cm) G krater from Crete. Here the meander, though elaborated to a double key form on one side, merely forms the outer frame for a vast central conglomeration of local motifs - mill-sail, hatched spiral hooks in diagonal cross formation, and diagonal check in the background. The more orthodox Atticizing MG design of 75.117 is related by style - and handles - to the Stirrup workshop of MG ovoid pithoi, type B (ii). The meander of the elegant miniature 125.6 is reduced to single outline in a thin zone, between numerous strips of single zigzag; these, together with the creamy surface, related this piece to the non-Atticizing MG workshop which also produced domed lids of type A (ii) and the early lekythos of Praisos type in the same tomb, 125.2. On 134.25, at the turn to LG, the centripetal Atticizing design is breaking up; the centre here, occupied by meander hooks, is encroached upon by the flanking bird metopes, and hardly stands out from the surrounding linear motifs. Well into LG is Teke tholos no. 19, 323 decorated with thin meander, massed multiple zigzag and cramped latticed lozenges, like the 318 GGP 17 ff; e.g. Kerameikos V 1 pls. 17, 22. 319 Coldstream in Stele Kontoleontos 410 f. pl. 195. ™ GGP iS, 23; pl. 5f. 321 F. no. 671; Fortetsa tomb A 7, BSA 56 (1961) 72 fig. 5; foot frs., BSA 67 (1972) 97 nos. 1 17-18 pl. 29; here frs. 283.102, 285.153. 322 Cf. also Teke tomb 3.24, BSA 62 (1967) pl. 14 (E-MG); Vrokastro 173 fig. 106 (MG). 323 '|y view has changed since GGP 243 n. 2, where I referred to this krater as MG.</page><page sequence="93">376 J- N.

Our MG frs. are matched by several from an exclusively MG domestic deposit,326 similar in their short oblique lips and simple Atticizing reserved panels. The perpendicular hatching of meanders on 292.164 and 75.195 relates them to other late MG vessels like the pithos 218.37 and the lekythos 292.116. In LG the lip becomes higher and more vertical.327 The kantharoid krater 75.182 is unique in Crete, but the shape and the vertical wiggles on the lip are at home in the Argolid.328 Argive LG imports are not unknown at Knossos (e.g. 229.28); but clay analysis has shown this vessel to be local, though not of the usual Knossian G fabric. In spite of its short lip, the paired sets of white circles on 229.3 must place it near the LG/EO transition. Alone of all G types, this form of krater persists into EO, with a much higher vertical lip.329 The Kalathos We deal first with two rare forms of Minoan origin before passing on to the usual PG type with two horizontal handles set well below the rim.

Late in their development, these kalathoi might sometimes be used as lids for cremation pithoi. Conversion to use as lids, however, did not preclude their continuing usefulness as bowls. The ckalathos-lid', therefore is included here, and does not need a separate heading. SM prototypes336 in some ways set the fashion for the PG kalathoi: bars on the rim, solid paint inside, and a rough and unpainted base. Our EPG examples are large (more than 30 cm in diameter) and at least deep enough to take the current concentric circles. Very deep kalathoi like E no. 162, regarded as 'experimental',337 are probably influenced by the shape of imported Attic handleless kalathoi like 207.41 and 42. On the rim, the bars are now in groups. T. 100 contains nothing before MPG, and the deep shape and wavy line of 100.16 and 24 are unlikely to be any earlier. With them go 285.155 and the large set from T. 207. Except for the concentric circle sets of 207.59, smaller than in EPG, the body decoration is limited to a single wavy line floating in a broad handle zone. A new feature is the widely splaying rim with its broad and flat upper surface, which may take a combination of grouped motifs: bars, solid triangles, and cross-hatched triangles (e.g. 207.71, 74). The shape is on the whole deeper than in EPG, and the diameter usually between 25 and 30 cm. From LPG onwards the prevailing shape becomes much shallower and considerably smaller, with an average diameter of c. 20 cm; very large and deep kalathoi like 104.60 and 107.144 are exceptional. Typical of LPG are the pendent semicircles of G 56 and 13.25 as also of F. nos. 358 and 1018, the last associated with a LPG necked pithos. In PGB, as one might expect, the decoration is freer and more varied, often arranged in two or more narrow 334 Cf.

N. COLDSTREAM zones; spirals, cables, hatched arcs, gridded zigzag, cross-hatched lozenges and massed double circles are all in evidence. For EG, 75.161 shares the doubled wavy lines of the contemporary shallow skyphoi, type B. A large set from T. 75, with 218.17 and D 24, are placed in EG because of the apparent association of 75.80 with an EG pithos (see below); their decoration is uniform, consisting of solid triangles and wavy lines in four or more narrow zones. G 54, with its reserved zone of multiple zigzag, marks the beginning of a conversion towards Atticizing Geometric ornament; but before this movement had gained any momentum, the kalathos has vanished from the repertoire. Two of the very latest kalathoi, 129.6 and 283.90, have ring feet. When was the kalathos first put to use as a lid? Perhaps already in LPG, with the changes towards a smaller size and a shallower shape. Then, too, occur two other modifications, both consistent with use as lids. The practice of decorating the base338 is first seen in the Maltese cross of F. no. 418 (LPG) and is common thereafter; alternative base motifs are the reserved cross and the hourglass (e.g. Q, 24). Secondly, the substitution of bands for solid paint inside, is rare before LPG339 but frequent from then onwards. Neither of these innovations, however, is consistently applied, and from the tombs themselves positive evidence for the kalathos-lid is meagre. In the N Cemetery very few of the later PG and EG urns were found undisturbed; the earliest clear evidence remains that from tomb TFT, where three PGB cremation pithoi - F. nos. 690, 696 and 710 - were crowned by kalathoi. In T. 75 the kalathos 75.80 was found immediately above a large chunk of the much-disturbed EG straight-sided pithos 75.110, which it fits remarkably well. This kalathos, however, is one of a set of nine, almost identically decorated; in the absence of any other urns from the tomb as early as EG, the other kalathoi must have kept their original function as bowls. The Skyphos Skyphoi are best considered under the same three main categories as the kraters, of which they are miniatures: first the PG bell-skyphoi, then the shallow skyphoi descended from cauldron shapes, and finally the various mainland types with high foot or low base. In most regions of the Greek world the skyphos is the preferred drinking vessel. To Brock it seemed that 'the skyphos was never popular in Crete, its place being taken by the cup'.340 His dictum holds true for the G period, but it must be remembered that he classified as 'miniature bell-kraters'341 the ever-popular bell-skyphoi of PG, and subsequently published settlement deposits have been prolific of all three categories.342 One function of skyphoi in tombs is illustrated by their occurrence in large homogeneous sets in the relatively undisturbed contexts. Sets of PG bell-skyphoi are sometimes found with the kraters to which they are related in shape, like 285.82; as Brock observed, 'they were probably for funeral libations', for the party of relatives and friends bidding farewell to the deceased. Similar concentrations of cups begin to be more frequent from PGB onwards, but a large set of low-based skyphoi may still occur even at the end of MG (T 104). 338 Anticipated, of course, by the Attic LPG kalathoi 207.41 and 42, which must be contemporary with Knossian E-MPG. 339 Earlier: 222.1 (SM?), 285.155 (MPG). 3*° F. 166. 341 F. 161, small kraters, Type B (ii). 342 BSA 67 (1972) 67 (PG), 80 (G).</page><page sequence="96">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY 37g A.

The low conical foot, narrow and poorly formed in SM, becomes broader, more substantial and better articulated in the course of PG. By LPG a broader body shape has been re-established. For the development through PG, evidence is supplied by the series 45.3 (with the SM/EPG stirrup-jar 45.5) the three from T. 285 (found in the MPG bell-krater 285.82) and F. no. 303 from the LPG tomb L: and also by comparison of H/DR proportions with smaller bell-skyphoi in datable contexts.

Simpler motifs prevail thereafter, with thin lines covering the lower body.349 These vessels are commonest in EG and are then the most usual type of skyphos after the passing of the bell-skyphos and before the low-based mainland types had become securely established.350 Miniature versions occur then, as 280.9 from an EG pithos burial. Usual motifs in this phase are one or two wavy lines,351 or a single row of pendent arcs (134.51).

In the decoration, the circles with Maltese crosses on the first pair follow an Attic formula, but without the usual rectilinear panel in the centre.352 Then, as an alternative circle filling, Q, 104a introduces a wholly non- Attic gridded chevron - a motif used more extensively on a larger vessel of very similar shape from Prinias,353 and on one side of the big MPG bell-krater 285.82. The pendent semicircles of Q 104b appear also in a slightly later piece, Payne no. 63, which shares the more articulated shape of O 44 with complete circles; on both vessels the offset lip, with solid paint, combines with the pendent semicircles to suggest influence from Euboea or the Cyclades354 rather than from Attica. Earliest among the smaller pieces, the unusually deep group of 207.17 approaches the proportions of the bell-krater, and the fringed lattice panel cannot be far in time from the later EPG bell-krater 48.7; but on such a small scale there is no room for lateral sets of circles. Later in PG the shape becomes shallower and develops an articulated lip (E 5, D 6) like the later versions; the decoration shows an experimental use of multiple brush for piles of floating zigzags (group of 207.17), or of white paint for dots and lines (D 6). Subsequent G examples are very rare, and perhaps intended as miniatures of high-footed kraters for children. The latest, 106.3, combines stirrup handles with a tall pedestal. The decoration mirrors that of contemporary low-based skyphoi. (ii) Low base (a) Various early types. Ring foot or slightly raised base. Mainly dark ground. SM/EPG: 98.9. E-MPG: 207.44 (light ground). MPG: J 11. PGB-EG: G 41, G 47, G 128. Imports from Cyprus are not known as early as the beginning of this series; even so, the hemispherical shape of the first two resemble a common Cypro-Geometric I form,355 as do the loop handles of 98.9, rising close to the rim. The EPG skyphos F. no. 62, also with a dark-ground wavy line, is a deeper and slightly later local adaptation of this type. The weaker wavy line of 207.44 recurs on contemporary kalathoi (e.g. 207.40); but the conical EPG skyphos-kalathos hybrid known from other cemeteries356 is not represented here. Affinities with the mainland begin with J 11, the first to have a distinct everted lip. The deep and rounded low-based form is at home in the Argolid357 rather than in Attica; the fine buff fabric with semi-lustrous paint was at first thought to indicate an Argive import, but chemical analysis has shown the clay to be local.

Imports of the familiar Euboean SubPG model (e.g. G 123) are not known before the late ninth century, later than the general context of T. 207; but the tall coated lip might perhaps suggest acquaintance with an earlier Euboean version.358 All, however, depart from the Euboean originals in various ways. Four, or even six (207.12) sets of pendent semicircles fill the panels, in contrast to the usual two in Euboea - a distinction consistent with the wider and shallower shape of the Cretan version, perhaps under the influence of the cauldron-skyphoi of type B. On 207.27 and 73 large reserved areas are left inside the lower body. As for the shape, only 207.27, with its low conical foot, is at all close to any Euboean prototype; the others have flat bases. The strap handles of 207.33 are taken from type B, which in exchange receives the pendent semicircles (e.g. J 18) in its earlier stages. (c) Coated EG: G 48 (miniature); 104.28, 49; 218.98, ioo. LG: 106.32. LG/EO: 76.2, 104.117. We come now to three Atticizing G types. The EG coated group is based on Attic MG I imports like G 40 and 126, with short oblique and offset lip, disc foot and the usual reservations inside. The careless miniature G 48 is fully coated and lacks the lip articulation; the other four follow the Attic model closely, with a rim diameter consistently of 14-15 cm. MG skyphoi are always decorated, but coated examples begin again after a long interval, on a more modest scale and with a high vertical lip. The body shape of 106.32, fully coated, resembles the contemporary black cup. On the last two the tall lips accumulate lines like decorated skyphoi of the same stage. This type persists into O, with the lip lines reinforced in white (107.55). (d) With multiple zigzags EG: G 125, 13.28. MG: 107.92, 75*99; 292.140 (with strainer top). Known imports bearing this motif are not Attic, but Atticizing Cycladic. The earliest local piece, G 125, is closely related to Cycladic MG I skyphoi like 219.25 and 41 with ring foot, short offset lip, and groups of freehand bars inside the lip. Likewise the double zigzag of 358 Cf.

The MG pieces, now with flat base, adopt the more vertical lip and rather deeper shape of Attic and Cycladic MG II. Once again, only the Cycladic counterparts have been found at Knossos.361 Zigzags on the local skyphoi are now drawn more loosely and spaciously than on the imported prototypes. The fragmentary 107.92 is a typically Cretan unicum: zigzags on one side, meander on the other, a white-on-dark star and a mysterious hole beside the meander, and no paint inside. The invalid cup, 292.140 is more practically designed than a slightly later Attic counterpart; 362 the strainer top, fixed to the Attic piece and rising awkwardly above its rim, is here detachable and concave. This type continues elsewhere into LG and even EO, usually with a smaller double zigzag, sometimes flanked by small metopes of diagonal crosses.363 (e) With vertical chevron. DR 10-13 cm. MG: 104.105, M 5, 219.29, 219.99 fr., 75.184. LG: 163.5, 107.169, 79.8, 76.3; 14.19, Q,52 (miniatures). The chevron skyphos, a creation of Attic MG II, was copiously imitated in almost every G regional school. Crete, in spite of the rarity of these skyphoi among previous finds,364 now proves to be no exception. Either Attic or Cycladic imports365 could have supplied the model for Knossos. The earliest local piece is F. no. 396, from the predominantly EG tomb LST. Like the imports and F. no. 396, our earliest examples have a short near-vertical lip with groups of bars inside, now drawn with multiple brush. Later in MG the original disc foot is replaced by a flat base, and the lip grows much taller and is less carefully articulated;366 inside, the groups of bars are now usually omitted.

LG: 14*^4; 19*23 (late)- Low-based G skyphoi made in the Attic tradition usually bear motifs of Attic origin; here we list the exceptions. For EG we have opposed groups of diagonals (107.77) and small sets of concentric circles on 13. 11; circles are otherwise unknown on skyphoi before late LG,368 but the shape and the context combine to support an earlier date. Horizontal S's appear in MG on G 127 and 75.97, and in LG on 14. 24. 369 Otherwise the motifs are simple and rectilinear. On 104.66 the oblique bars are a further simplification of the vertical chevron scheme.370 The herring bone (107. 99)371 and the thick-and-thin bars (104. 77)372 are more at home on cups, types E (i) and (ii). It remains here to summarise the development of the low-based G shape. At first, Attic and Atticizing imports were closely imitated. Cretan EG skyphoi are based on the Attic MG I profile with low oblique lip, a relatively shallow body, and a ring or disc foot. For MG the model is Attic MG II, where the lip is more vertical, and the foot may now be omitted. Thereafter, as imports become much less frequent, the local shape goes its own way in LG; the lip becomes taller and less precisely articulated, and the base is nearly always flat. The skyphos now begins to be supplanted by its lipless relative the kotyle, to which we now turn. The Kotyle LG: 229.19, 104.9, IO7*89, 106.28. LG-EO: 78*9 (miniature). The kotyle was first evolved in Corinth at the turn to LG from the local version of the chevron skyphos, -with the gradual elimination of the lip.373 A fr. from the area of the Minoan palace374 is from an import of the Aetos 666 kotyle,375 the earliest Corinthian type with chevron decoration and a hemispherical body. All five of our pieces follow this model in a slightly shallower form and, after 229.19, on a smaller scale; but all except 106.28 also preserve a slight nick on the rim, in memory of some of the very earliest Corinthian specimens.376 Since the miniature 78.9 cannot be earlier than an advanced stage of LG, it is as if subsequent imported types of Corinthian kotyle - like 292.42 - for a time made no impression at all on the Knossian potter. On the contrary, still within LG, shallow Cretan kotylai may be decorated in accordance with local taste, with double circles,377 or fully coated.378 Adaptations of the deeper Corinthian form belong wholly to the local O development.379 368 E no. 874, with late LG pithos no. 870. 369 Cf.

An unusually deep piece, with lip slightly offset, occurs in a EPG domestic context.384 The pair from T. 207, similar but even deeper, perhaps mark the transition from the equally deep but light-ground type A. J 14, much shallower but still with an offset lip, is from a context not later than MPG; with it go Q, 17 and Ay. Ioannis I. 45. But these are rare and isolated experiments, outnumbered by imported Attic PG cups which predominate in the large libation set from tomb J. The dipped cup became fully established in LPG, when it assumes a broad bell shape with average H/DR ratio of 0.7. The profile is now a triple curve. A gently everted lip, no longer offset, overhangs a convex belly; a slightly concave lower body sometimes gives the impression of a disc foot (D 39, G 66). This type may now occur in large sets, as in F. tomb L.385 After LPG the shape loses its characteristic bell-like profile with overhanging rim, and is gradually assimilated to the small Atticizing bellied type D (i).

The other cups copy only the shallow and bellied Attic shape, all surfaces being fully coated.

The coated cup now attains a size considerably larger than most skyphoi, but the most remarkable innovation is the vast improvement in fabric. Gone are the uneven rims and rough bases of the preceding type; the clay is now so carefully prepared that the wall may often be less than 0.2 cm thick. Brock reasonably suspected the influence of a metallic prototype, even though the only known bronze version is somewhat later.393 In plundered tombs these cups are found broken into myriads of small fragments; lists of this standard LG type, and of its O successors, will thus give little idea of its great frequency. The earliest context of the thin-walled cup is in T. 218, where nos. 45-6 were found with the late MG pithos no. 39. 394 Thenceforth the shape became progressively deeper,395 a process continuing through the O period when these cups become even more numerous (O 389 F. nos. 284, 332-3. 390 cf# F. nos. a.&lt;'a and 1031-2. in PGB contexts. 391 Brock, F. 50, no. 491; 166. 392 F. 166 f. class B (iii). 393 F. 167; no. 1560, a stemmed bronze cup, has a body like our type D (iii), but the tall lip places it well down in the O period. 394 Also UM II pls. 54 and 63, GD 22, in a MG domestic context. 395 Associations with F. pithoi illustrate the development of shape through LG (nos. 1452, 1131, 1465) into EO (no. 1025).</page><page sequence="105">388 J- N- COLDSTREAM cups, type A).

Here we include all decorated G cups where the ornament is enclosed on three sides by solid paint, with lines running round the lip. The first two are early experiments of local character, with straight vertical wall, low centre of gravity, and little or no lip. The huge and lipless 175.38, more a tankard than a cup, is 20 cm high, and deeper than its rim diameter. Comparable EG pieces, though with a slight lip, are E no. 656 and a sporadic find from the Roman Villa Dionysus.397 The MG group, with short offset lip and bellied profile, is the decorated counterpart of types D (i) and (ii). First made in Attic EG II, bellied cups with reserved panels hardly survive into MG in their original home;398 but the type persists into Argive399 and Cycladic MG,400 and may well have been introduced to Knossos through Cycladic imports like 283.96. A striking feature of the Attic version, and of its close imitations elsewhere, is the pair of bosses flanking the panel; these seem to have been adopted at Knossos even before the usual Atticizing panel motifs occurring already on the deep and experimental cup F. no. 656, and also on F. no. 921 which combines the Attic bellied shape with a local curvilinear design of PGB-EG origin, a row of arcs with hatched background. Closest to the Attic and Atticizing models are our first four MG cups, where bosses flank panels of multiple zigzags, and on the first two there are groups of bars in the interior reserved band.401 Other MG panel motifs reflect local taste in various ways. The meanders of 292.82 and 134.67, as on other local shapes of this time, are filled with perpendicular hatching. The tongues of 292. 91402 survive from the earlier curvilinear repertoire; on the other cups from T. 292, on which the bosses are omitted, the herring bone is another local variant. These MG cups are of medium depth (H/DR ratio 0.65-0.75). The earliest, 65.3, has a ring foot; the others, a disc foot or flat base.

Cups with this decoration occur in Attica406 and the Argolid,407 quite late in LG. The only previously known Cretan example is F. no. 420. The shape conforms to the LG stage of type E (i). In the decoration there may be some chronological development from 104.96408 to 134.40, in the retreat of solid paint from the area by the handle. Later still are the careless thick bars of 78.10; eventually they are replaced by blobs between single bars on 294.52, which nevertheless preserves the bosses of type E (i). On the handles, a tall diagonal cross is an alternative to the usual barring. (iii) White-on-dark: several narrow zones with pointed zigzag and groups of three bars. H. 4-5 cm.

N. COLDSTREAM All six may be added to the finely decorated cups attributable to the LG Bird Workshop.409 Its early LG stage is represented by 40.43, contemporary with the pithos 85.2. This cup already introduces a typical metopal motif of the workshop, seen also on 132.26 and 24: the lozenge quartered by a diagonal cross, with small lozenges in each quarter. Apart from the claw preserved on the fr. 132.26, the characteristic bird is represented only on 75.202; its sinuous neck, curved wing and fish tail is matched on the cup F. no. 672, and even more closely on the pithoi Payne no. 27 and Atsalenio A 4. At the LG/EO stage, orientalizing blooms are admitted into the metopal repertoire; linked lotus (132.24) and quatrefoil rosette (132.25). In the intervening 'triglyphs', the earlier intersecting vertical zigzag (75.202) is now simplified into mere cross-hatching. The curious fauna of 134*47$ real and imaginary, have been discussed elsewhere,410 and attention has been drawn to their affinities with creatures on the Idaean shields and other proto-orientalizing bronze- work;411 the flying bird, however, owes something to the earliest Orientalizing vase- painting of Corinth.412 The Plate PG: 285.118. M-LG: 104.104. This rare shape is unknown in F., and is best considered as a narrow-based variant of the local tray. The handles, in contrast to the reflex form of the Attic G plate, instead follow successive types of tray: A, with rising handles (285.118), B, with lugs vertically pierced (104.104). The Tray Under this heading we consider shallow vessels with low wall and broad flat base, with a H/DR ratio between 0.1 and 0.3. In F.413 Brock noted five pairs, of which only three fall within PG and G. The new finds help to fill out a continuous sequence from EPG to LG, divisible into three types according to the number and formation of the handles as well as variations in profile. Of Brock's pairs, only the first, in tomb VI, conform to a single type; but our finds do lend some weight to a supposition that this relatively uncommon shape was often doubled as a tomb offering, since pairs within the same type also occur in tombs 13 and M. T. 100, however, boasts a homogeneous set of six PG trays and also three double trays, a miniature embedded inside the main vessel; one envisages a well- appointed funerary feast, the composite trays possibly serving for mezedhakia. Much later, a quite different function is recorded in the Mastamba tomb, where three M-LG trays were used as lids for cremation pithoi.414 In domestic contexts, only type C is known to be frequent. 409 GGP 24.6 f. nos. 10-15; cf. ovoid pithoi type C (ii). 410 RA 45 (1982) 25 ff. 411 For the sphinx cf. the Kavousi relief, AJA 5 (1901) 148 fig. 10; for the frontal lions, E.

The decoration of the main E-MPG group is simple: solid paint inside with reserved bands, in which concentric circles are added on the rotating wheel; dots on the rim, bands and lines outside, the underside left rough and unpainted.415 The same scheme is applied to the miniatures inside the composite trays. The reserved freehand semicircles on the floor of J 25 suggest continuity from an earlier tradition, and indeed fragmentary SM prototypes - though in domestic contexts only - have been recorded at Knossos416 and at Karphi.417 The compass-drawn semicircle zone under L 11 is the earliest ornament applied to the underside, which henceforth carries the main decoration-as though it were now customary to hang these vessels on the wall. The same motif occurs under the centre of Gypsades no. 51, but the accompanying zigzags and wavy lines indicate PGB-EG. With these later pieces the wall is becoming more convex, turning gently into the base. Two of the last examples mark the transition to type C, with two level handles: only two handles rise from the rim of 285.66, while F. no. 370 (also PGB) has three level handles, and the concave lip of type C.

EG: 13*22, 13.32, 13.49 &amp; MG: 125*15 (plain). Derivation from a coarse PG prototype is suggested by F. no. 91 (E-MPG) followed by G 50, the latter having handles level with the rim; but they lack the short concave lip of the painted trays, on which the lug handles are set well below the rim. These begin with a rough PGB piece, F no. 353, with a hatched cross above and below the base. The pair 13.22 and 13.32 are finely and copiously decorated with freehand curvilinear motifs in the manner of major EG works like the pithoi with lids G 6-9. A little later (MG?) comes the vast tray F no. 422 (D. 43 cm) where birds in various poses figure in an elaborate cruciform composition under the base. The painted series ends with the three trays from the Mastamba tomb,418 more simply decorated with reserved cross, eight-spoke wheel and massed triple circles which must be well into LG. The plain undecorated 125.15, from a MG context, reverts to the lipless coarse prototype with lugs level with the rim; but the polished orange fabric, far from coarse, recalls the unpainted aryballoi (type B) and also a class of plain LG-EO cups found only in domestic contexts.419 This type is revived in O as a plain lekanis, e.g. H 14 and 31. 415 Cf.

The florid ornament under the bases of the EG group, in two or more concentric zones, resembles that of the omphaloid domed lids, type A (i). As with the lids, it is possible that the freehand curvilinear repertoire survives well into MG, to judge from two frs. in a domestic context of late MG to LG;420 but the MG phase is also represented by the usual Atticizing decoration, including the hatched leaves found under Attic MG flat pyxides.421 The fr. 26.15 combined an old-fashioned cable with a bold and elongated meander, recalling the early LG stage of the Bird Workshop.422 Apart from the silhouette birds on the fr. 24.8, later LG pieces are more summarily decorated, with many zones of light ornament (18.36) or with bands only (104.85). The simple banded scheme, with dots on the rim, persists into EO on trays with very low walls.423 The Larnax (i) With painted decoration LMIIIai: 107.214. LM III A2: Q, 116; 292.239, 294.63 frs.

It may be no coincidence, then, that the two figured works, over five centuries apart from one another, were found in the same tomb. The other pictorial larnakes are of lesser intrinsic interest, and only two preserve enough of a composition to permit any useful comparisons. The spiral plants of Q, 116, with arcs linking the spirals, resemble those on a long side of the larnax from Upper Gypsades tomb XIII, on which a papyrus plant on a short side is of LM III A2 type.426 The solid and outlined quatrefoils of 85.1 appear as a framing ornament on the LM III A2 griffin larnax from Palaikastro,427 but the promotion of this motif to be the main decoration is more characteristic of LM III B, as also on contemporary pottery.428 Of the more fragmentary pieces, 294.63 and 292.239 each preserve part of a stylised cuttlefish429 in the LM III A2 manner, not yet standardised into its regular LM III B form. The corner of a hatched meander preserved on a long side of 104. 118430 reveals a unique imitation of a Minoan chest larnax in a much later age. This meander could have been drawn at any time between the late ninth century and the late eighth, but the wild accumulation of supporting ornament suggests PGB-EG rather than later. The scale is small, but not miniature; with a foot 6 cm wide, the larnax could have been at least long enough to have accommodated the inhumation of a small child.431 The fish swimming vertically up the foot recall those under the handles of the Tree Painter's Goddess pithos, 107.114. Another such fish appears in the field of the scene partly preserved on a short side, where we see the lower half of a robed female figure bending over a triangular gridded object - possibly an altar or sacred tree - but it is fruitless to suggest any reconstruction of the composition. What matters here is the relevance of this find to any inquiry into possible sources of ideas for our ninth- century figured scenes. If the shape of the Minoan larnakes could provoke later imitation, why not their decoration too? IMPORTS 1. Attic Attica is by far the most prolific source of imported pottery. The imports fall mainly into the Attic LPG and MG phases, which are also well represented among Attic pottery exported to other regions.432 In this cemetery, however, the range of the Attic vessels is unusually wide. It includes shapes hardly ever exported elsewhere, such as the PG kalathoi and the MG pointed and flat pyxides. Abnormal, too, is the abundance of finely decorated belly-handled amphorae, which 425 Lyvia Morgan, BSA 82 (1987) 171 ff. 426 S.

Furthermore the drinking vessels, like their local equivalents, sometimes occur in large sets, like the twenty-two PG cups from tomb J and the eight MG I cups from tomb G. There is also a distinguished set of three large MG II vases from tomb 219, all by the same hand: a flat pyxis, a lidded krater and a vast belly-handled amphora. Elsewhere it has been suggested that these choice vessels came to Knossos though gift exchange between noble families433 rather than through casual commercial traffic. In general the sheer quantity and the unusual features of the imports raise the possibility of some special relation between Knossos and Athens between the tenth and early eighth centuries (see Epilogue, Section III). NECK-HANDLED AMPHORAE LPG: 285.129. MG II/LG I: 219.93 fr. LG II: 30.6 fr. The scheme of 285.129, wholly dark-ground but for a narrow belly zone, is typical of the latest Attic PG closed shapes. The zonal motif of oblique bars alternating with solid triangles appears on a group of amphorae like ours, from the Agora excavations,434 all but one coming from well-deposits. These are placed by Desborough at or near the change to EG, and indeed an EG grave at Corinth contains another similar but local amphora with coated neck.435 Ours, however, is assuredly Attic and precedes the slightly slimmer Attic EG I versions on which a reserved panel is always added to the neck.436 The vertical hatching of the neck meander on 219.93 is not to be expected much before the end of MG II, and dark-ground amphorae with similar meander panels continue to figure in LG I grave groups.437 Another imported amphora of this class is represented in a rim fr. from a Knossian well-deposit.438 The neck fr. 30.6, with the wheel motif, is from an early version of the well-known SOS class.439 BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORAE LPG-EG I: 13.48 fr., 219.89, 90 frs.

In our cemetery we cannot tell whether any of these vessels served as urns. All are fragmentary, apart from G 3 which did not contain ashes, and 207.52 from a disturbed PG tomb whence the bones recovered suggest inhumation rather than cremation. If the abundance of these amphorae is surprising in their Cretan context, they nevertheless add something to our knowledge of the Attic sequence. 433 Coldstream, Gift Exchange 204 f. figs. 1-5. 434 Desborough, PGP 10, class B 3; 13 f. 435 S.

Our earliest piece, 13.48, is of a normal PG type441 also copied in the close imitations J 4 and L 7, decorated with semicircles on the shoulder and a largely light-ground body. Then follows the dark-ground amphora 207.52 where the design of the belly zone - four sets of circles filled with reserved cross, and intervening panels of rectilinear ornament - is an elaboration of LPG;442 but the neck, which had been undecorated throughout PG, now receives a thin zone of ornament in the EG I manner.443 Five other frs. are consistent with this scheme: dogtooth or multiple-outline battlement on the neck (e.g. 106.26, Q, 70), and the four-circle arrangement on the belly with various rectilinear ancillaries in vertical strips (285.14, 100.42, 219.91). This apparently homogeneous group now has a close counterpart in Athens, in grave 5 of the Odos Kriezi cemetery.444 Together with this Athenian example, our EG I amphorae help to fill the gap in the Kerameikos series, and also provide the Attic prototype for close Cycladic imitations like 0,63-4. Into the later part of this Kerameikos gap falls 100.39. Greater weight is now given to the rectilinear components which here include hatched meanders, dotted zigzag with filled apices, and chevron columns; the circles, too, are filled with chevrons in each quarter. Very similar is the composition on the monumental krater Kerameikos no. 935 which marked the grave of a warrior early in EG II.445 Other elements of this fragmentary amphora look forward to a later EG II example, Kerameikos no. 2146:446 the strips of dogtooth above and below the belly zone, the reserved zone on the lower body, and the barred bucranium handles.447 The next three amphorae, another homogeneous group, are slightly later than Kerameikos no. 2146 and fall into MG I.448 They introduce several new features: the expansion of the neck zone, to include a broad meander between ancillary motives (G 3, G 83); in the belly zone, the reduction of the circle panels to two on each side, the vertical meanders now dominating the intervening rectilinear columns; and the insertion of small filling ornaments like dot rosettes into the corners of the circle panels (G 3, N 6). On the shoulder and lower body, the large areas of dark paint are interrupted only by a single group of horizontal lines. The ovoid body shape is considerably more attenuated than that of 207.52; barred bucranium handles are now normal, and a reinforcing ridge is regularly added below the rim.449 Our series culminates in 219.33, 104 cm high. In Athens this superb amphora would not easily have fitted into a grave as a cremation urn, and is large enough for a grave marker; at Knossos, where it was found in fragments all over a tomb floor, its function is not clear. In its complex wealth of ornament it surpasses the only two MG vessels from Attica of comparable size: Kerameikos no. 1256,450 a sporadic find which could have been an MG I grave wPGP&lt;xo'GGPu. 441 E.g.

The continuous spread of decoration over almost the entire surface demands a date near the end of MG II, not long before the prime of the Dipylon Master as seen in Athens 804. Two other imports from the same tomb, the krater 219.42 (with lid 32) and the pyxis 219.23 (with lid 59) were probably painted by the same hand. On all three vessels the brushwork and choice of motifs are very similar, and all three share the same unorthodox details: sixteen-point stars as filling ornaments (see the pyxis lid), diagonal hatching of meanders without the usual changes of direction, and four-line divisions instead of the usual three lines on the pyxis lid and in the vertical panels of the two larger vessels. In addition, the lozenge chains on the amphora and krater are of an unusually square shape. The circle fill - an eight-spoked wheel or double Maltese cross - is without parallel. SHOULDER-HANDLED AMPHORA LPG: J 23. This is the smallest and probably one of the earliest specimens of a shape which arose late in LPG, and became in its day an alternative to the belly-handled amphora for female cremations in Attica.452 Larger counterparts, with the same motif of alternating diagonals, are all EG: but some are with considerably taller necks,453 while on another the neck receives a thin zone of decoration in the EG manner.454 J 23, combining a globular body with a short and undecorated neck, is likely to be older than these, and still within LPG. OINOCHOAI LPG: J 8. MG I: G i85 19, 95; 75.2Oi(?). Smaller: G 22, 96; 283.32. MG II: 107.141, 285.67. J 8 belongs to a standard dark-ground class of LPG with decoration on the shoulder, matched in shape and modest size by the large set from Kerameikos PG grave 48.455 The unusual addition of latticed triangles to the normal semicircles is seen on a LPG round-mouthed jug from Eleusis,456 and on some contemporary oinochoe sherds from the Kerameikos.457 The broad-based Attic oinochoe, dark-ground with a reserved panel on the neck, develops slowly from EG II throughout MG, and not with any great consistency. None of our pieces is likely to be as early as EG II, when the base is always extremely broad.458 A relatively tall version first emerged in MG I, but tall and plump varieties coexisted all through both MG phases;459 there is, however, a tendency to raise the centre of gravity and tighten the body contours in the course of the MG series. By this criterion the three large and tall oinochoai from tomb G should be MG I, comparable to Kerameikos no. 1253;460 the bars on the lip of the fr. 75.201 are also a MG I trait.461 Our two MG II pieces, with more compact body and a «' AD 21 (1966) B 97 ff. pl. 95 b, H. 86 cm. «2K?/&gt;o7ff. 453 Kerameikos Vi pl. 42 no. 601; J.

One example with similar decoration, however, is known from a context as late as EG II.467 MUG MG II: 294.12. The tall lip and the meander hooks are unlikely to be earlier than MG II.468 The shape has a good parallel of this period at Eleusis, in the Isis grave.469 POINTED PYXIDES MG I: 283.46 with lid 283.9; 107.210 fr.; 219.69, lid. Apart from a fr. from the settlement of Lefkandi,470 no exports of this shape have previously been recorded. The pointed pyxis, always richly decorated, flourished chiefly in EG II and MG I. Schemes dominated by emphatic meanders are typical of MG I,471 and 283.46 has a close counterpart with the same decoration among a MG I grave group now in Toronto.472 ^ GGP pi 5b. 463 Kerameikos Vi pl. 72, grave 41. 464 Smithson, Hesperia 43 (1974) 353. 465 Cf.

Invented at the EG/MG transition, the earliest flat pyxis is still relatively deep, in memory of the EG globular type from which it was evolved.473 Our first two pieces, with multiple zigzag as the main or only motif, belong to a mature stage of MG I as represented by graves on the Areopagus.474 Much later is 107.72, on which the lax vertical chevrons argue a date well down in MG II. The magnificent pyxis 219.23 was probably painted by the same hand as the giant amphora 219.33. Like Kerameikos no. 257, 475 which it resembles in shape, its lid was crowned by a single horse figurine, of which part of the tail survives. Continuous meanders are characteristic of the larger MG II pyxides; this is an exceptionally large pyxis (D. 35 cm), and its two broad meander zones are without parallel. KRATERS LPG: 207.7. MG: 283.102 frs., 292.163 fr. MG II: 219.42 with lid 219.32; 285.153 fr. The small skyphoid krater 207.7 is an enlargement of the high-footed LPG skyphos, but a flaring foot476 is substituted for the strictly conical form of the smaller vessels. The decoration - circles filled with reserved crosses, and an asymmetrical rectilinear panel of latticing and solid lozenges - is exactly as on Würzburg 76 from Melos, whose high foot has been cut off.477 The Attic fabric of 207.7 supports the view that the Würzburg krater, too, is an Attic import.478 The four MG pieces belong to a class with simple offset lip and (apart from 219.42) a tall splaying pedestal;479 the decoration is organised round a central meander panel. No complete Attic krater of this type is known before MG II, and too little of our first two pieces survives to justify assignment to either MG phase. The two feet, and the rim fr. of 283.102 are close in shape and decoration to the early MG II krater from Amathus;480 but the lower foot profile, with the dogtooth zone, is also matched by the fr. Kerameikos no. 871 from the MG I grave 37.48. Low-based kraters are rare in Attic MG, and 219.42 has no close counterpart;482 the bucranium handles are more in keeping with a different class, that which culminates in the Dipylon grave markers.483 The miniature oinochoe on the lid recalls the pyxis-krater Paris A 514;484 an ornament relevant to the vessel's original function at an aristocratic symposium.

Among this painter's departures from MG II orthodoxy is his tendency to repeat the main meander motif in two equal units. The fr. 285.153 probably had a tall pedestal. With its stirrup handles and its strong central meander, it provides the model for the local krater 75.117; but the horses which flank the main geometric design are the only living creatures yet known on Attic G exports to Crete. They invite comparison with three other kraters with similar compositions: Kerameikos no. 2Q2,485 the fr. Agora P Ô422,486 and the pyxis-krater Paris A 514 already mentioned. The horses on these three vessels display various primitive features no longer present on 285.153. On our piece they stand on the ground line (as later in LG), but well above it on the other three kraters. On the Paris and Agora vases, as also in the earliest G representations,487 a solid mass of paint runs parallel to the horse's upper outline; on 285.153, the horses are in framed rectangular metopes, as also on the Kerameikos krater. The Kerameikos animals, however, have a strained and laboured look, with all the leg joints over-emphasized; on our piece the rendering is more fluent. The articulation of the upper thighs, not visible on a live horse, recall the animals on the Paris vase; but the hooves are omitted, and the extreme elongation of the cannon bones looks forward to the style of the Hirschfeld painter in the next generation.488 One should also remark on the abundance of filling ornament in the horse panels, in contrast to the light chevrons on the Kerameikos and Paris kraters. These details, taken together, imply that 285.153 is the latest of the four horse kraters; but the centripetal meander design places it still within MG II. KALATHOI LPG: 207.41, 42. In spite of precedents in the Late Bronze Age, kalathoi do not seem to have entered the Attic repertoire ¡before LPG.489 Two varieties then occur, with490 and without handles. Handleless kalathoi from Athenian LPG graves491 are concave in profile and bear one or two rectilinear zones on the dark ground; the base, too, is decorated. This type persists into the ninth century, but usually with the addition of later motifs.492 Our two pieces, with almost identical decoration, are larger (Ds. 26.8 and 34 cm) than any previously known Attic examples, and differ from them in other respects too. Their shape is deeper and straighter; 207.42 even has a slightly convex profile, and a disc foot in contrast to the normal flat base. Also unusual is the decoration in as many as three or four zones, perhaps a consequence of the larger scale; but a handled kantharos from Nea Ionia493 is equally ornate, and bears exactly the same range of motifs - checkerboard, single zigzag and dogtooth. 485 GGP pl. 5d, f; Kerameikos Vi pls. 20, 21. 486 J.

This shape, too, makes its debut not before Attic LPG,494 when it was never more than a rare alternative to the skyphos and the one-handled cup; it resembles the former in size, the latter in the overall body coating. Our two LPG pieces are close in shape to the only published Attic LPG examples with a high conical foot, Kerameikos no. 2026.495 At the end of PG and in EG I a low conical foot is preferred.496 An unusual variant is represented by D 34, with a high ribbed pedestal. The nearest counterpart is Kerameikos no. 930 from the EG II warrior grave 2;497 but a similar meander panel, filling almost the whole handle zone, also occurs on a low-based kantharos with ring foot, from an early MG I grave group recovered from Thorikos.498 SKYPHOI LPG: J 15, 22, 50; 207.6, 219.85 fr., 285.152 fr.

For the short panels without lateral framing lines, comparable chevron skyphoi come not from Athens, but rather from Eleusis510 and from exports elsewhere.511 The skyphoi with sigmas are much deeper, and perhaps therefore later, than examples with this motif from Athens and Eleusis.512 For a less common shallow form, with level strap handles, 107.134, the shape and thin striping are well matched in a MG II context in the Kerameikos;513 and the neat dotted lozenge chain is another characterstic motif of this phase. With its two antithetic birds flanking a chevron column, 75.162 finds a companion by the same painter in the Fogg Museum,514 identical in shape and decoration except that a quatrefoil metope has been inserted on the Fogg skyphos as the central motif. Both pieces belong to the very beginning of LG I, at the head of a long series of LG skyphoi with birds in metopes;515 the fan tail has been noted as an early feature of Attic G birds.516 Our last two pieces fall into LG II, a period when Attic pottery was rarely exported.517 31.16 closely resembles Agora P 20083518 from a LG II A child grave. The shape, new in this phase, is now deep and unarticulated, the flaring rim overhanging the body; the decoration, floating freely on a light ground, consists of light motifs which would be filling ornaments on larger shapes. For 106.19, a rare variant on which one of the handles is vertical, Eleusis 585519 - also from a child grave - supplies a parallel to the shape at the very end of Attic LG. CUPS, HIGH CONICAL FOOT LPG: J 27, 34, 36, 40, 42, 44-5, 51, 54. On this homogeneous set of cups, the lip is very short and offset. They are fully coated but for the usual reservations inside the rim, on the floor and round the foot; a line runs round the lip outside. Examples from the Kerameikos, mainly from LPG graves,520 are similar in body shape but differ consistently in having a lip high enough to take the usual zigzag or scribble. An Agora well, however, seems to provide a good parallel, although the foot is broken off.521 CUPS, FLAT BASE LPG: J 28-30, 32-3, 39, 41, 43, 47-9. MG I: G 69-76, N 18-19, 283.34. This shape enters the Attic repertoire late in PG,522 overlapping the high-footed variety. Both types, indeed, occur together plentifully in tomb J. The usual form, represented by J 48, has a flat base, a coated body, a barred handle, and a short but distinct lip with the normal reservation inside and out.

The flat-based cup continues without any consistent change or development into LG.526 2. Corinthian LPG: pyxis 285.134 with lid 285.138; pyxis lid 285.158 fr. MG: handmade aryballoi O 3, 283.8. The globular pyxis is a faithful copy of the Attic LPG prototype.527 A grave group in Corinth has produced a close counterpart528 with the same motif of alternating diagonals, and a similar lid. Chemical analysis (p. 000) has demonstrated a Corinthian composition for the clay of the handmade and unpainted aryballos 283.8, and with it should go O 3. Unpainted aryballoi in Corinthian graves are always handmade,529 and persist continuously from LPG into LG. There is some development in the growth of the neck. For O 3 the closest parallels are in MG I contexts;530 283.8, with its taller neck, can be matched in a MG II grave group.531 This meagre sequence of Corinthian imports is filled out by part of a high-footed MG krater,532 the MG II painted aryballos E no. 668, and frs. of early LG chevron kotylai.533 EPC is represented here by numerous deep kotylai (O kotylai, imported) but not, surprisingly, by the widely exported globular aryballos. 3. Argive LG II: krater fr. 229.28. Rows of schematic soldier-birds and leaf-lozenges are painted in an unmistakably Argive manner534 with a quadruple brush. The lax style, in which the painter indiscriminately mixes one-legged and two-legged birds, and lozenges with and without dots, indicates a date well into Argive LG II. The warm tone of clay suggests Asine,535 always the most outward-looking centre in the Argolid,536 and source of several comparable kraters.537 A similar import occurs in an outlying tomb west of Ay.

At Lefkandi the sequence of vertical-handled amphoriskoi extends from SM to SubPG I without any consistent development in shape;542 but 285.124, with shoulder semicircles and a 'good ovoid body', has close counterparts in shape and decoration in two grave groups of LPG.543 An almost identical amphoriskos comes from a recently excavated tomb at Ay. Ioannis.544 Although its shape is not certain, the body fr. 28.18 displays a SubPG feature in its sharply angled shoulder. A neck-handled amphora from Lefkandi545 provides a good parallel to what we have, but the shape could also be restored as a large oinochoe.546 Of the three pendent-semicircle skyphoi, G 123-4 are of a type current during Attic EG and MG I according to a recent study;547 characteristic of this type are the deep rounded body and the offset lip of medium height. A date towards the end of the ninth century is likely for these two pieces, 548 since their lips are shorter than those of the latest examples from the cemeteries of Lefkandi which are associated with early MG I imports from Attica;549 in general the later development is towards a shorter lip.550 Near the end of the pendent- semicircle series comes 134.48, conforming to a smaller and shallower type datable to well down into the eighth century.551 The low lip is now more vertical, and the earlier ring foot is replaced by a flat base or (as here) a disc foot.

COLDSTREAM however, for the main lines of the composition to be clear. As on the Attic MG II horse kraters considered in relation to 285.153, a large central meander is flanked by single horses in rectangular panels; but the design here is more intricate, with at least two columns of linear ornament intervening between the horses and the meander, swastika panels under the horses, and several zones - including another small meander - below the main composition. For this arrangement the nearest Attic equivalent is Kerameikos no. 1255 from a LG I grave;552 but our krater is not Attic. The main central meander seems to be of the stepped form favoured in Argive LG I.553 The outlined cross is a filling ornament often used in the Argolid,554 but it also occurs in a horse panel on a krater from Eretria,555 in a style close to the Cesnola Workshop. More links with that workshop are established through the tangential triple circles on the lip, and the rendering of the horses themselves.556 Our krater could be about contemporary with the Cesnola krater, but has firmer roots in the MG past, as seen in the zones of continuous meander and dogtooth, and in the long panels of triple zigzag. Under each arch of the bucranium stirrup handles there are traces of a boat, too fragmentary to add much to our understanding of Geometric shipping; an unusual feature is the zigzag pattern on the rigging, seen also on the ship incised on a coated skyphos from Eretria.557 The skyphos 60.2 carries the bulky gridded lozenge typical of Euboean LG metopal decoration.558 The shallow shape, with overhanging lip, conforms to the LG II class with slip- filled designs, the latest known type from Lefkandi.559 6.

Q, 63-4 are close imitations of the Attic model represented here by 207.52, with only minor differences in style; the painting is a little less precise, and the shoulder semicircles560 are a conservative survival from Attic LPG tradition. This pair thus fills a gap in the imports of Cycladic amphorae between the LPG F. no. 154 ('perhaps Cycladic'),561 and F. no. 269, based on an Attic EG II prototype but with three circle panels562 instead of the usual two on the Attic versions. The fr. O 42 is from a large vessel with a short concave neck and a plump body. The opposed diagonals with empty interstices are characteristics of SubPG in Euboea and the Cyclades; the slightly micaceous fabric suggests a Cycladic origin, and the neck is most easily 552 Kerameikos Vi, pl. 23, grave 26. 553 Cf.

Two distinct fabrics were evident to the eye among the Cycladic MG imports. The amphora and the skyphoi from Ts. 107 and 292 of a highly micaceous orange-brown or orange-red clay; all but 107.98 were tested by laboratory analysis and found to be Naxian. The skyphoi from Ts. 100 and 219 are of a lighter orange clay with only a little mica; they, too, may be Naxian, but Paros is also a possible source. All these vessels follow Attic MG prototypes. The amphora is based on developed MG I pieces like Eleusis 816,566 of which Naxian imitations now prove to be plentiful.567 As for the skyphoi, the meander (100.35) l* not often seen on Cycladic versions, but nevertheless occurs on Thera - perhaps on imports from some other island.568 The other skyphoi all bear the more usual panel design of multiple zigzag. Large skyphoi like 107.98 (DR. 19 cm) are at home in Cycladic MG,569 and Naxos produces a close parallel in shape and decoration.570 A skyphos from Rheneia571 and another from Naxos572 match those of more normal size with the orthodox triple zigzag (219.25, 41, 63; 292.87). Less usual is the double zigzag of 292.75, very rare on the Attic prototypes but by no means uncommon in the Cyclades.573 A similar import found its way to the settlement at Phaistos.574 Latest among this group is 292.50, with its deeper shape. The MG cup 283.96 conforms to a common Cycladic prototype.575 The advanced LG skyphos 75*41, in a pale brown micaceous clay, belongs to a phase when the styles of different islands have become more distinct. The group of floating chevrons and dots, as a panel motif, is typical of the Parian style576 after it had broken free of Attic influence. 7. East Greek SubPG: krater 285.89.

COLDSTREAM The oinochoai 219.43 and 97^0 are coated in a lustrous red slip, with profuse circle decoration in dark paint and some reinforcing white lines. Perhaps because of the low firing and soft texture, most of the original paint has flaked off, taking with it the underlying slip; thus, at first sight, the decoration seems to be scored through the slip. Cypro-Phoenician influence is apparent in the red slip and the circle decoration, but the highly micaceous fabric is alien to both Cyprus and the Levant. A similar ware occurs in Cos581 and Rhodes582 on other shapes of oriental appearance, on which similar circle decoration seems to have suffered in much the same way. The laboratory analysis of 219.97, however, revealed a composition that proved to be no good match for any control samples, even though of the East Greek comparanda it is most similar to those from Miletus. As sample K 100, it is discussed below in pp. 480-81. 8. Cypriot After Attica, Cyprus is the most frequent source of imported pottery.583 Compared to the Attic imports, the range of the Cypriot vessels is more limited in function and time. The forms of the imports are all closed, with a marked predominance of small and slow-pouring unguent vessels; and the imports are virtually confined to the eighth century, mainly in the early part of Cypro-Archaic I, but with a few pieces going back to a late stage of Cypro-Geometric III. The fabrics, as defined in the SCE system, are represented as follows. There are two Bichrome vessels and one White Painted, the first imports of these fabrics to be recorded in Crete; but the great majority conforms to BoR types already known from F.584 A more fundamental distinction is in the various shapes, by which the imports are here arranged. For the sake of consistency and convenience, Aegean terms are used: lekythos for the Cypriot 'juglet', oinochoe for the Cypriot 'trefoil-lipped jug'. Within each shape, the finds are subdivided by period and fabric. OINOCHOAI CA I BoR II: 292.94, 175.52, 107.199 fr. WPIV: 229.11. Oinochoai with circle decoration first appear in CG III in the latest tombs of Lapithos,585 but belong mainly to CA I. Most are in BoR. The WP IV version 229.11 is a rare departure, but nevertheless bears the usual scheme of decoration: horizontal lines on the shoulder intersect the flanking vertical circles, with small circles in the field, and a bisected diagonal cross (a stylized floral motif?) pendent from the neck band on the front. Similar decoration appears on the BoR oinochoe Atsalenio A 45, the only example previously recorded from Crete. 292.94 and 175.52, a close pair, are less orthodox in their shorter necks (as also 229.11) and the omission of the horizontal lines.

The two Bichrome frs. are from the first vessels in that fabric to be found in Crete. Their squared rims and flaring lips precede the usual mushroom-shaped mouth of Bichrome IV,588 and are consistent with lekythoi from the latest CG III tombs at Lapithos.589 The BoR lekythos is by far the commonest Cypriot type to be exported to Crete.590 In this cemetery there seems to be a preference for unguent flasks of unusually large capacity. In Cyprus most are between six and ten cm in height, but every one of the complete or near- complete vessels listed here591 attains a height of over eleven cm. The base offers the chief guide to dating: flat or nearly flat in BoR I, and then with a disc or ring foot in BoR II,592 but with no sign of the later tendency towards the biconical. Two BoR I pieces, 219.40 and 134*339 are decorated in the manner of the oinochoai with large circles on the flanks and front, like some from CG III contexts at Amathus.593 The BoR II examples all bear the more usual decoration of small circles on the shoulder, and lines below. Here some distinctions can be made in fabric, coinciding largely with minor variations in circle ornament. Those from T 285 and 292.97, all precisely potted, share the normal deep orange clay and red-brown slip of Cypriot BoR and carry only one set of small circles on the shoulder.594 By contrast, 292.48, 51 and 132 are less skilful pieces with a lumpy and uneven surface, and a yellow-grey interior - perhaps the result of different firing conditions; and their decoration consists of two sets of circles.595 The BoR I example 285.88 is alone in possessing a softer fabric, heavier wall and thicker slip, and three sets of circles.596 This piece, however, was sampled with 292.48 and several lekythoi of the first group, and proved to have a similar composition consistent with SW Cyprus (p. 492, L106).

It is well matched by a similar vessel from Khirbet Selim,608 which even shares the metallic knobs where the handle joins the trefoil mouth - a feature thought to be characteristic of Phoenician Red Slip in its early stage.609 Equally typical of early Red Slip is 597 Cf.

Both pieces are likely to precede the appearance of the mushroom-lipped Red Slip lekythos in the second half of the eighth century, a form to which 56.10 - and probably also the fr. 292.211 - belong. This is a leading shape in the later Red Slip repertoire, associated especially with Phoenician maritime expansion into the western Mediterranean.611 The crisp, thin fabric of our piece, together with its baggy profile and carinated shoulder with incised lines, first occurs at Tyre in contexts of the late eighth century;612 but the type persists well down into the seventh, and one grave context in the Phoenician homeland613 must be at least as late as that of the LO vessels accompanying our piece in T 56. ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY Brock's absolute dates for Knossian PG and G614 were based chiefly on the contexts of a few Attic and Atticizing imports, and of their close local imitations. Since the publication of i?, much more evidence of this kind has come to light, and the Attic phases to which the imports belong can now be more closely defined; meanwhile there has been good reason to lower the dating of the Attic sequence in its earlier stages, especially the transition from Attic PG to G. A reappraisal of Brock's Cretan chronology would not be out of place. First, a few remarks on the quality of the evidence. Most valuable of all are the contexts where an import can be clearly associated with a decorated pithos-urn, easily datable within the local sequence. Much less significant, though far more common, are occasions when we know only the full chronological range of the collective tombs in which the imports occur. These more general contexts should not be ignored, since the imports are unlikely to fall outside the phases represented by local pottery in the same tomb. The most useful of these contexts are supplied by tombs where the local pottery is confined to a single phase; or even by a pair of tombs used for several generations but with a narrow chronological overlap. Thus, if tombs x and y were each used over a long period but overlap by only a single phase, and if the two tombs contain closely similar imports, it is likely that these imports will be contemporary with the local phase represented by the x/y overlap. The Knossian EPG style was formed partly under the influence of Attic imports, which in the tombs do not begin before Attic LPG.615 It follows that the local EPG must be to some extent contemporary with Attic LPG, an inference already confirmed by the three Attic imports from the general E-MPG contexts of F. tombs VI and XI.616 In our tombs some imports are associated with individual urns, but are not particularly revealing. The small high- handled oinochoe O 7, an unusual shape of Attic LPG or possibly EG, was found inside the coarse grooved pithos O 6 of a standard E-MPG type. In the centre of the dromos of T. 285, part of an Attic LPG skyphos, 152, was retrieved from among the smashed frs. of 7, a coarse 610 Culican, ibid. 611 Chapman, art. cit. 168 nn. 226, 229-30. 612 Bikai, The Pottery of Tyre 35, jug 5, levels III- II, pls. 5.19-23, 6.4-5; c- 740-700 (p. 67 f.).

N. COLDSTREAM straight-sided pithos. This association, if sound, would merely demonstrate that straight-sided urns might occur in coarse ware well before their entry into the painted repertoire during PGB; but the pithos had almost certainly been shifted from its original position, and a small PGB lid, 8 5 was found nearby. Far more significant is the accumulation of twenty-five Attic LPG imports, very homogeneous in style, among thirty-six local EPG and MPG vessels in the unplundered tomb J. The only two burials, both found in the coarse pithos 2, can hardly have been separated by more than a generation, especially if (as the excavator surmises) the upper burial, a secondary inhumation, has been swept up from its original position and placed above a subsequent cremation as an act of family piety. We cannot know whether the imports go with the earlier, or with the later, or with both burials; but their excellent condition - especially of the cups - makes it likely that some of them, at least, were offered with the later burial. What is clear is that they form a large homogeneous group near the end617 of Attic LPG, near in time to the change from EPG to MPG in the local sequence. Knossian EPG, then, should fall wholly within the period of Attic LPG, and MPG will have begun before the LPG/EG transition in Attica. A clue to the duration of MPG comes from the chronological overlap between two tombs with closely similar imports. In T. 207, in use from SM/EPG until LPG, the latest imported piece is the Attic EG I belly-handled amphora 52. A faithful Cycladic imitation, 0,63, occurs in a tomb where the local pottery begins in MPG. Attic EG I, a brief phase,618 should therefore fall somewhere within this M-LPG overlap. Knossian LPG, however, has already been seen to coincide with the equally brief Attic EG II phase, since an Atticizing Cycladic amphora of that date, F. no. 269, was found in the wholly LPG tomb L.619 The local MPG phase, then, will have begun shortly before the end of Attic LPG, and then lasted through Attic EG I. To Brock's absolute dates for the PG phases, two modifications need to be made, which have the effect of cancelling each other out. Following the excavators of the Kerameikos cemeteries, Brock assumed a date of c. 950 for the transition from PG to G in Attica.620 This date was based on a supposed terminus ante quern of c. 925 for the two SubPG vessels found in level III at Tell Abu Hawam in Israel. It now appears that the closing ofthat level can have no relevance to the dating of Attic PG, since it proves to contain imports as late as MG II.621 Meanwhile, by a process of dead reckoning and an estimation of the amount of development within each Attic phase, the end of Attic PG is now usually placed around 900, with LPG occupying most of the tenth century.622 For Cretan chronology, however, this lowering of absolute dates for Attica is compensated by the need to raise the dating of Knossian EPG in relation to the Attic sequence, so that it ends before the end of Attic PG. Thus it turns out that Brock's absolute dates623 still offer a working hypothesis. His 970-920 for EPG now falls well within Attic LPG, but needs to be preceded by a transitional SM/EPG stage - say 1000-970 - when Knossian potters were responding only very sporadically to the influence of the earliest Attic imports. For MPG, Brock's 920-870 is now seen to include the final years of LPG and 617 The closest Athenian comparanda are mainly from the latest PG graves in the Kerameikos, nos. 38-9 and 48; cf.

LPG is largely contemporary with Attic EG II; perhaps it merits a slight expansion of Brock's twenty-year span624 to 870-840, to accommodate a larger and more varied corpus than was apparent solely from the F. finds. Copious imports of Attic and Atticizing MG help to throw some light on the chronology of the next three Cretan phases, which must be based on the currently orthodox dating of Attic MG I (850-800) and II (800-760). Study of previous finds gave the impression that PGB is contemporary with much of MG I,625 that Cretan EG is a short phase spanning the transition from MG I to II,626 and that Cretan MG coincides with the remainder of MG II.627 With these correlations the evidence from the N Cemetery is quite consistent. Among the general contexts we should note especially the presence of numerous Attic MG I imports in tomb G,628 and a Cycladic MG I skyphos (35) in tomb 100, both of which were used until EG.629 There is also a large accumulation of MG I imports in tombs 107 and 283,630 neither of which contains any local pottery before PGB. It follows that the PGB-EG overlap common to all four tombs should be largely contemporary with Attic MG I. The 'bilingual' belly-handled amphorae lead to much the same conclusion. On 104.23, for example, the spiral and cable design on one side belongs towards the end of the PGB-EG freehand curvilinear sequence; on the other side, the circle-and-meander formula shows that, when a Knossian vase-painter of these years wished to attempt a wholly Atticizing design, it was to MG I models like the imported amphora G 3 that he would turn. None of the Attic or Atticizing MG II imports can be safely associated with an individual burial,631 or even occurs in any helpful general context; thus the correlation of Knossian MG with most of Attic MG II must continue to rest on similarity of style. The grandiose rectilinear designs on the krater 75.117 and the amphora 292.58, based on a strong central meander, would be unthinkable without the influence of MG II imports like the krater 219.42; and other local amphorae make use of motifs not seen in Attica before MG II, for example the dotted lozenge chain of 134.15, and the hatched meander hooks of 292.224. A supposition that Knossian MG lasted into the early part of Attic LG632 would be confirmed if the Parian LG skyphos 75*41 belongs with a MG group including a pithos from the Horse workshop, 75«38; but the association is far from certain, the vessels having been removed from their original position and scattered on the dromos floor. Evidence for dating Knossian LG has hitherto been confined633 to resemblance of style, at first with Attic LG I, and later with Corinthian (EPC) through the local kotyle sequence.

Even though good reason has been found to raise Gjerstad's chronology by half a century - i.e. the CG III/CA I transition from c. 700 to c. 750 - the 'vagueness' still remains since (i) Cyprus produces very few single-burial associations, and (ii) the development of the most frequently exported shape, the Black-on-Red lekythos, has not yet received any meticulous study. Associations of these lekythoi in our tombs are considered in RDAC 1984, 136; see also GGP 318 and Cyprus and Crete 261 n. 31 for previous chronological links between Crete and Cyprus.</page><page sequence="129">412 J- N. COLDSTREAM associations with imports are now available. With the larnax burial T. 31, the Attic LG Ha skyphos 31.16 (c. 735-725) occurs with three small coated LG cups; and in T. F/67.1 an EO cylindrical lid with white-on-dark circles (9) was found with an EPC deep kotyle (10), but evidently not in situ. Neither of these associations conflicts with a previous hypothesis based on style, that the transition from LG to EO was complete by the end of EPC,634 i.e. approximately at the end of the eighth century. FABRIC AND TECHNIQUE^ Here we concentrate exclusively on fabrics which, to the naked eye, appear to be local. Visual criteria for distinguishing the various imported fabrics are stated in ch. 8 pp. 471-3, describing samples earmarked for analysis by Atomic Absorption. The results of that analysis also distinguished three different compositions for the local fine ware, one of which was overwhelmingly more frequent than the other two; but no consistent difference between them is apparent to the naked eye. The clay of most Knossian PG-G fine ware636 is of a pale orange or buff colour. On the larger vessels the core may fire to a deeper reddish orange or, less frequently, grey. Admixture of inclusions varies according to the size of the pot. Most typical are the substantial particles of white calcite which may cause spalling on the surfaces of the larger vessels; brown and grey inclusions are also found. In PG a thin yellow wash is often added; but, owing to the relatively low firing, the wash and the overlying paint seldom adhere well to the surface. Higher firing in G produces a harder and often darker orange fabric; paint is applied more thickly, usually without a slip, and sometimes achieving a considerable lustre. Especially characteristic of PG are the time-saving technical devices of spattering and dipping. Spattered paint is often applied to the interiors of large and wide-mouthed shapes: bell-kraters, necked pithoi, shallow kraters and skyphoi, and some kalathoi, all in the local tradition - and even high-footed kraters of mainland character like 175.27-8. From the end of EG onwards, open shapes receive a solid coating inside.637 Partial dipping in paint is the usual way of treating the commonest classes of PG drinking vessels. The cups, held by the handle, have their rims dipped on both flanks. Small bell- skyphoi, often remarkable for their thin fabric, are dipped from the foot so that the paint covers most, if not all, of the interior. Dipping ceases in G, but is occasionally revived in the O period. White decoration over a dark coat first becomes common in LG and continues well into O, but earlier experiments go back to EPG;638 to these we may now add the two large PGB bell- skyphoi 100.37-8, the coarse straight-sided pithoi639 of type (i), and the large lekythos 107.130 decorated in white with PGB spirals. In LG, as we have noted, the domed lid of type B (i) is the first shape to adopt the white-on-dark technique, perhaps to simulate the appearance of the bronze shields of which they are miniature versions. From these lids, white decoration spreads to the pithoi, at first only in subsidiary rows of small circles, later as 634GG/&gt;254f. 635 These remarks are supplementary to Brock s observations, E 186-8. 636 Cf. also BSA 67 (1972) 65, 78. 637 There are some instances of spattering on O domestic pottery: BSA 68 (1073) Su. ess BSA 67 (1972) 65, A 27 (pi 15), C 40 (pl. 19). 639 Also E nos. 343, 345; cf. p. 188.</page><page sequence="130">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY ^3 reinforcement of reserved lines, and eventually for a wide variety of metopal motifs in the Bird Workshop - a tradition which continues in the EO lekythoi of Praisos type. Apart from the zigzag cups of type C, no open shapes receive white decoration before the LG/EO transition. In the colour and treatment of G fine ware, two other interesting variants deserve notice. Close copies of Cypriot BoR unguent shapes, lekythoi type C (ii), often reproduce the deep orange clay and polished surface of the Cypriot originals. A similar fabric is shared by the looser adaptations with trefoil lip, aryballoi type C (i). A deep orange tone, though without the polish, is sometimes preferred for globular aryballoi with latticed triangles on the shoulder, type C. In striking contrast of surface colour, another class of G vessels is coated with a pale creamy slip, often polished. The two common shapes are the domed lid with a single handle, type A (ii), and an early version of the Praisos-type lekythos, type D (ii). Both are profusely decorated in a wholly non-Atticizing manner, but nevertheless belonging mainly to MG. The MG phase also saw a temporary vogue for the grey bucchero ware, seen in three shapes only: the heavy four-handled ovoid cremation pithos of type B (iv), the matching conical lid with ribbed stem among type C, and oinochoai, mainly of the broad-based Atticizing type, C (ii). The clay is as carefully prepared as for fine painted ware, coated with a dark slip, and then fired to a light grey or greyish-brown colour in reducing conditions. Decoration is confined to incised wavy lines on the pithoi, whose shape closely matches those from the MG Horse workshop. The local origin of these MG bucchero vessels, as also of the later O bucchero aryballoi, has been confirmed by samples taken for analysis by Atomic Absorption. There remain the two fabrics regularly used for coarse ware: the micaceous red, and the gritty orange (or bufi) characteristic of large plain pithoi. Both wares merit and are receiving detailed petrological analysis which will be published elsewhere;640 here, meanwhile, a few visual observations must suffice. Brick-red micaceous ware, also containing a variety of small white and brown inclusions, has frequently been noted in small domestic cooking vessels,641 which are also present in our tombs. In those which form a clear typological sequence - for example, the cooking jugs with and without tripod feet, types F (i) and (ii) - there is a noticeable improvement between MG and LG in the preparation of the clay, and in the elimination of impurities. Our cemetery also produces several other shapes in this fabric: miniature tripod cauldrons (kraters type B (i)), the lugged flat pyxis 283.58, small ribbed oinochoai imitating a Cypriot form (type E (i)) and, on the largest scale, bulky straight-sided pithoi of type (i) with their conical lids, type A. The last three shapes, unlike the cooking jugs, have their surfaces carefully smoothed; the pithoi and lids are even capable of taking simple decoration in white paint. On the other shapes, any decoration is incised, and limited to sets of grooves - apart from the highly ornate flat pyxis. The gritty orange fabric is used for large, coarse and plain domestic pithoi which also served in PG as cremation urns, and in G for child burials. Other shapes in this ware are the large imitations of bronze cauldrons (krater, type B (ii)), the domestic basin 168. 1, and the fenestrated stand 283.98.

The largest, of jagged white limestone, may be as much as 0.5 cm long. The other, smaller, inclusions are reddish brown, bluish grey, and smoother white particles. The surface is usually covered with a thin buff wash, and sometimes with a thick cream slip. DEVELOPMENT OF THE KNOSSIAN STYLE The local PG and G sequence was initially worked out in considerable detail by Brock, on the evidence of nearly a thousand pots from twenty-two tombs. These final pages concentrate on whatever new knowledge can be gleaned from a larger corpus in the N Cemetery. Here and there, gaps may be filled, greater precision may be achieved, but new problems may be raised. One not wholly resolved problem is to establish a universally agreed boundary between SM and EPG.642 The most obvious symptoms of the new style, under the influence of copious Attic PG imports, are the introduction of compass-drawn circular motifs with the multiple brush, and of two Atticizing types of amphorae. Concentric circular decoration, however, could find no place on the shoulder of the most conservative Knossian shape, the stirrup-jar; that is where complex triangular compositions of SM character persists well into PG, though often in a more rectilinear form. At the same time the shape may develop toward a more taut ovoid, in line with other PG closed vases; but there is no steady rapport between the move towards the ovoid, and the geometricization of the SM compositions. To designate vases where SM characteristics are still prominent in a PG context, we avoid the ugly though logical term 'Sub-Subminoan' in favour of SM/EPG. If the initial impact of Attic PG ideas was so limited, is there any other roughly contemporary change in the local pottery which can be adduced as an alternative frontier between SM and EPG? One helpful shape here is the deep bell-krater, first seen in 285.60 and in its three close relations in F. tomb XI, nos. 166, 168 and 177. The height of all four greatly exceeds the rim diameter, by a ratio of 1. 20-1 .40: here, at the transition to EPG, we see a sudden extra deepening of the traditional LM III 'deep bowl', of which the few SM examples643 have a height and rim diameter approximately equal. The deep bell-krater was to become the major open shape of Knossian PG; in the decoration, antithetic spirals (SM/EPG) are still applied to these four early pieces, but thereafter the Attic PG concentric circles soon take over (48.7, K 1, Ay. Ioannis I.9, III.i). Drinking vessels, as yet, resist Attic influence altogether; the most usual EPG form, the bell-skyphos (e.g. 219.78, 79) is a miniature of the new bell-krater, and a similarly deepened transformation of its SM predecessor (e.g. F. no. 2). Decoration is very rare; dipping from the foot becomes the rule, especially for the smaller bell- skyphoi, and we no longer find the interior reserved lip band, usual in SM. Other novelties of EPG include globular light-ground oinochoai and jugs with minimal decoration; also, for use as urns, the first necked pithoi in fine painted ware (48.3, 5, 6, SM/EPG; J 63). In MPG, as Brock observed, 'the decoration is now purely Pro togeome trie'. Concentric circles, in this phase, are regularly applied to a wider variety of the larger shapes: necked 642 Warren, AR 29 (1983) 76-87; Popham in UM II, 60, 65-6; Catling, here pp. 305-10. 643 E.g. UM II, pl. 44 (for correct caption see pl. 43).</page><page sequence="132">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY ^ pithoi, neck-handled amphorae, bell-kraters and kalathoi. Our new finds show that more Attic shapes, too, were now being copied. In addition to the two large types of amphora, we have MPG Atticizing kraters (175.27, 28; 100.41) and large skyphoi (Q, 68, 103), both on high conical feet, flat based coated cups J 12) and handleless globular pyxides with everted rim (K 5, L 1, 2); all four shapes have prototypes in known Attic imports to Knossos. None of them, however, displaced their local alternative, i.e. the bell-krater, bell-skyphos, dipped cup and straight-sided pyxis, inherited from LM III through SM. Even so, perhaps under the influence of their Attic counterparts, the local bell forms of krater and skyphos assume rather broader proportions than in EPG, with a height to rim diameter ratio of 1.00 to 1.20. To strengthen its rim, the bell-krater is now usually provided with a pronounced ridge below its lip: a good example is 285.82, which contained a helpful variety of undisturbed MPG funerary crockery - large and small bell-skyphoi, and five light-ground globular oinochoai, now with flat base instead of, as in EPG, a low conical foot. LPG: 'not a well-defined phase5 (Brock). Definition by context, indeed, remains difficult. Although the largely LPG Ts. 28 and 287 offer a variety of shapes, the use of both tombs continued into PGB. Typologically, though, as Brock observed, this phase is essential as 'filling the gap . . . between the preceding and the following phases'. His dictum is supported by the ornament of the most floridly decorated LPG vases; the open-neck stirrup-jars, apparently all from a single workshop; the fine oinochoe 100.33, and the house models 219.86 and UM II, GB i. Here pendent semicircles are joined by a new repertoire of rectilinear motifs - gridded zigzags, gridded battlements, columns of latticed lozenges, and rows of small latticed triangles. The pendent semicircles may perhaps have been derived from Euboean SubPG skyphoi like G 123-4; otherwise this mixture of motifs reflects a purely local development during a temporary lull in influence from Attic imports. On the larger shapes, concentric circles continue. Among LPG shapes, there are several innovations. For unguents, the open-neck stirrup-jar (D 11), final manifestation of a shape surviving from LM times, is eventually superseded during this phase by the first lekythoi (E 2, 100.64, 218.94), made on the same large scale as the stirrup-jars. As smaller containers of perfume, the jug-aryballos (e.g. Q 4) makes its first tentative appearance. An early fascination with eastern exotica is reflected in the local LPG lentoid flasks (219.16, 285.30), bird askoi (219.1, 12; 285.136) and ring kernos (285.68). More central to the Knossian potter's repertoire is the impact of the bronze cauldron (e.g. 285*f.26), now closely imitated in coarse ware with (100.3) and without (287.15) the tripod legs. Looser versions in fine painted ware (L 15), together with their related skyphoi (100.10; 2O7*33&gt; 47* 63) also begin in LPG, but become commoner in PGB and EG; though sparsely represented in F.9 these forms are abundant among our finds. Apart from these novelties, some changes in other shapes deserve notice. Neck-handled amphorae no longer have their necks coated, as in earlier PG phases; and the type with spaced bands only (28.12) seems to be confined to this phase. Globular pyxides have by now acquired rising horizontal handles (e.g. D 25-8), and the old straight-sided type is becoming obsolescent. The finest LPG oinochoai (Q,7, 28.8, 100.33, 287.25) now tend towards dark- ground decoration. Two shapes, the hydria and the dipped cup, were mentioned by Brock as LPG innovations. Both, as we now know, prove to go back as far as SM, especially in domestic contexts;644 but it remains true that richly decorated hydriai, as tomb offerings (e.g. 287.8), 644 Dipped cups: Popham in UM II, 61, pl. 43.7-8 (not, as there 'pl. 42').

COLDSTREAM are unknown before LPG, and the dipped cups are especially frequent in this phase. Absent from F., but apparently new in LPG and continuing only into PGB and EG, is a smaller type of cup decorated with a scribble or zigzag above massed stripes (287.29, 34). Before leaving the main PG sequence, let us not forget the astonishingly bold experiments in figured drawing on two bell-kraters: the portrayal of a hunt on F 1 (MPG), and on E 3 (LPG) the dramatic leontomachy with confronted sphinxes on the reverse side. While the hunt scene has precedents on LM III larnakes, the imagery of E 3 would have been inconceivable without some contact with the eastern Mediterranean. From PGB until the LG/EO transition, my remarks are supplementary both to F. and to the coverage of these phases in GGP 235-55. PGB still lives up to its reputation as 'the most remarkable phase in Cretan vase- painting,'645 with much new evidence of creative invention. Few individual interments of PGB can be isolated in the N Cemetery, since so many chamber tombs then received their first incumbents which were to be continually shunted and disturbed in subsequent periods. Even so, PGB has produced more than its share of new surprises, especially in figured representations. From the hand of the Tree Painter, the earliest recognisable artist in the decoration of Greek vases, we have on the straight-sided pithos 107.114 his extended scenes portraying a goddess of nature in her element, on a scale unmatched in any other Greek Geometric vase-painting. Also remarkable are the Janiform birds on the belly-handled amphora D 14, and the curious monsters round the shoulder of the miniature Atticizing oinochoe Q, 23. These may perhaps have their three-dimensional equivalent in the ebulliently decorated horse-bird askos Q, 115. Its miniature rider, and the warrior's head on the small lid 219.72, attests a fresh interest in modelling the human face, dormant since the demise of Minoan civilisation. Among the many innovations in shape, Brock drew attention to the new straight-sided pithos, vehicle of the most daring and original new designs; also 'many experimental forms of oinochoe and tall-necked aryballos'. These are defined here as the jug-aryballos, already appearing in LPG; the lekythos,646 now of a more modest size that was to become normal; also the squat and carinated oinochoai (here types B (iii) and B (iv)); and two other kinds of oinochoe, both of eastern origin. A small ribbed class, in coarse micaceous clay (type E), follows the shape, though not the fabric, of Cypriot Black Slip counterparts, derived in their turn from Bucchero vessels of the Late Cypriot Bronze Age. The giant oinochoai, with very tall and narrow necks (type D), are influenced by a prototype in Phoenician Red Slip, but at once take on the most florid PGB decoration. As for the open shapes: the large black cup with flat base now enters the repertoire, and soon displaces the latest PG bell-skyphoi as a favourite drinking vessel; and the kalathos is now often adapted to serve as an urn lid, although conical lids have already begun to be made especially for this purpose. The rich and eclectic mixture of PGB motifs has already been described,647 and needs only a brief summary here. Brock saw 'the confluence of three separate currents': concentric circular ornament, representing a conservative PG strain and still often seen on old-fashioned shapes like the necked pithos and the bell-krater; new freehand curvilinear designs (arcs, 645 Brock, E 143. 646 Jug-aryballoi and lekythoi are both well represented in the closed PGB deposit under the larnax Q, 116, together with the bird-horse askos Q, 115 already mentioned. 647 F. 143; GGP 236-8.</page><page sequence="134">THE PROTOGEOMETRIC AND GEOMETRIC POTTERY ^ cables, running spirals etc.) derived either from the Minoan past, or from eastern metalwork and ivories; and minor rectilinear motifs of Attic Geometric origin. The Atticizing component now receives some stiffening from the appearance of the large Attic hatched meander on three major PGB vases: M io, a late bell-krater; D 13, an Atticizing high-footed krater; and D 12, perhaps the earliest of our straight-sided pithoi.648 The checked meander on the belly-handled amphora D 14 is a fanciful Knossian variation. Of EG Brock wrote CI suggest the existence of such a phase with some reservation, since the evidence for it depends solely on style.5 We now have some evidence from context in two exclusively EG tombs, 280 and 286, allowing us a view of the smaller shapes; also, from Teke tomb G, an impressive array of large and ornate vessels in Brock's EG style.649 In their decoration we see a variety no less eclectic than in PGB, but with a stronger current of influence coming from Attic MG; hence the justification for naming this brief and unsettled phase which has nevertheless produced some of the most impressive vases from the N Cemetery. The transitional character of EG is nowhere better illustrated than by the coexistence in tomb G of three different shapes of urn; first, the latest of the now old-fashioned necked pithoi (G 12), with traditional PG circular ornament; second, one of the later straight-sided pithoi (G 6) on which the curvilinear motifs continuing from PGB are now more strictly zoned; and, third, the emergence of the neckless ovoid pithos, the only type of urn to enjoy an assured future over the next two centuries. Although modelled after an imported Attic prototype650 (which, however, was never common in Attica), meanders and other Atticizing motifs by no means monopolise the decoration; on the contrary, as on the vast pithos G 8, the Attic rectilinear and local curvilinear repertoires may be blended to form complex and eclectic designs, including expansive rosettes which are typical of this phase. We see the rosettes also on the earliest domed lids651 for the urns, and on the one-handled omphaloid type A (i), another novelty of this phase, on which only the local curvilinear motifs are deployed - and in florid abundance. Apart from the neckless ovoid pithos, the novelties include other shapes more central to the Attic repertoire: the belly-handled amphora in its dark-ground Attic form, the krater on a high ribbed pedestal, and the broad-based oinochoe. Of Attic origin, too, is the notion of modelling the knobs of the conical lids for urns (e.g. G 7) in the form of miniature vessels.652 In the decoration of the larger Atticizing shapes, the coexistence of three different repertoires - concentric-circular from PG, freehand curvilinear from PGB, and rectilinear from Attic MG - is confirmed by the exuberant 'bilingual'653 vases, i.e. the amphorae (G 2, 4-5, 82 and 104.23), the pedestalled krater (G 80) and the ovoid pithoi (G 8, 11), bearing totally different compositions on the two sides of the same vase. Most bizarre of all, in this respect, is G 5, combining a large Atticizing hatched meander on one side with, on the other, concentric circles of PG character, but interrupted by billets and wrapped within a proto-orientalizing hatched cable. Among the smaller shapes, new in EG are the juglet, the olpe (jugs, respectively types C and D), and the globular pyxis with low vertical neck and flat base, type B (v). 648 Stele Kontoleontos 409-12. 649 Especially G 1-2, 4-15, 17, 60, 82.

COLDSTREAM In MG, urns with their contents undisturbed are much more numerous than in previous phases. To the thirteen in F., the North cemetery can add nine more;654 and T. 125, although plundered, appears to be a wholly MG tomb, to judge from its three urns. The king of MG shapes is the recently introduced form of urn, the ovoid neckless pithos: plump and heavy, it normally has two horizontal and two vertical handles. The decoration follows the exuberant manner of Attic MG II with the hatched meander assuming a dominant role, but some local curvilinear motifs are also admitted as ancillaries. Compositions between the handles are usually varied on the same pithos; this variety, together with other individual traits, allows the recognition of two individual workshops, based on groups distinguished by Brock.655 His first group, to which our tombs contribute fifteen more pithoi, is named the Horse workshop after its representations ofthat animal on 125.3 and Atsalenio B 6; these, together with the workshop's habit of painting piles of kangaroo-like birds in silhouette on the vertical strap handles, help to fill what was previously a lacuna in the sequence of Knossian figured vase-painting. An invariable preference for stirrup handles supplies the name for a second workshop, based on Brock's second and third groups, and expanded here by nine more vessels. For each workshop, a consistency between shape and decorative mannerisms implies that potter and painter were then either the same person or, at least, worked closely together. Other large Atticizing shapes, copiously decorated in the Attic MG II manner, are the neck- handled amphora and the pedestalled krater. The amphorae 292.160 and 292.57 were probably made in the Horse and Stirrup workshops respectively. We can also assign the large krater 75.117 to the latter workshop, which evidently adopted its stirrup handles from monumental Attic kraters of this class.656 Atticizing, too, are the conical lids made to fit the pithoi, with matching decoration of meander or multiple zigzag, and often with ribs on the stem; and 125.4, with its frieze of kangaroo birds, is clearly a product of the Horse workshop, designed to fit the pithos 125.3 w^h the horse panel. The MG repertoire also includes three standard Atticizing shapes bearing simple reserved panels on a dark ground, whose frequency at Knossos would never have been suspected on the evidence of finds in F.: the broad-based oinochoe, the shallow skyphos and the small flat-based cup. These often follow their prototypes not only in shape and decoration, but also in technique,657 being fired to a pinkish-brown colour resembling Attic, yet never achieving the high sheen of the best Attic work. In contrast to the conical lids for pithoi, the domed alternative remained quite unaffected by the current Atticizing fashion. The one-handled omphaloid lid with high dome and broad rim (A (i)) persists into MG (e.g. 60.10), and is joined by a new handleless type (A (ii)) with lower dome and shorter rim, exemplified by 125. 11 and an ornate set from T. 132,658 where their abundance suggests that the domed class may have had a function independent of the urns. These lids are still decorated on a light ground, with motifs descended from the local PGB-EG stock: grid pattern, intersecting wavy lines, horizontal S's (or broken cables) and billets. Their fabric is unusual for its thick cream slip, always highly polished. In the same style and technique is 125.2, one of the earliest tall lekythoi of Praisos type (D (ii)), by the same painter as the lid 132.18; common to both is a simplified version of the PGB tree motif. Brock saw as 'deliberately archaistic'659 the use of local curvilinear motifs on some LG lids, 654 O i; 75.I9, 38, 42; I29.I; 218.39, 43, 50; 285.39. Foresee GGP 242. 655 F. i¿8. ese E.g.

Some of smaller unguent vases of MG reflect foreign influences from other directions. Two current types of globular aryballos, the unpainted and polished (B), and the dark-ground with triangles on the shoulder (C), both follow Corinthian models found among imports to Knossos;660 the type with triangles remains frequent through LG into EO. From Cyprus, the import of BoR lekythoi (or 'juglets5 in Cypriot parlance) begins in this phase, at once giving rise to almost exact local copies,661 closer to the originals662 than any of the 'Creto-Cypriot' class in F. The progress of the Knossian LG style is most easily charted through the decoration of its leading shape, the ovoid pithos-urn. Following Brock's lead,663 I have elsewhere attempted to distinguish early and late LG pithoi from the general run, and also a transitional LG/EO stage in which new curvilinear motifs from the East are grafted into a geometric context.664 A useful second division, cutting across each stage of LG, is between the ornate and exuberant products of the inventive Bird workshop, and the more conventional pithoi decorated with 'formality and restraint'.665 The decoration of our LG pithoi is treated earlier in this chapter, in detail; here we need only a brief summary, paying special attention to any novelties, absent from F. Pithoi of the Bird workshop666 have a plump shape, and decoration still extending down to a continuous zone below the handle, as in MG; there a weighty meander with heavy outline is especially favoured. When fully formed, the workshop's style is recognisable through a new LG stock of metopal motifs, including birds of predatory appearance. Two of our pithoi, 85.2 and the fragment 26.13, supply a hitherto missing early LG stage, immediately following after MG but preceding the advent of metopal decoration. With the metopes come the addition of tripod loop feet, the first intrusion of white-on-dark decoration and, eventually, experiments with strange polycephalous birds. Among our nine late LG pithoi from this workshop, all painted by a hand unknown in F., the masterpiece is O 19; there a sprawling three-headed bird, with its young, is bordered by two metopal zones of white-on-dark motifs, including a geometricized revival of the Minoan octopus.667 Perhaps the same painter produced the domed lids with octopus medallions, B (iv), also in the white-on-dark technique. From the Bird workshop, too, are the large, deep cups, E (iv), with similar metopal decoration; the extraordinary 'menagerie'668 cup 134*47 extends the figured repertoire to include sphinxes with outlined heads, predatory birds in flight, and tawny lions seen in frontal view-possibly influenced by the bosses on some bronze votive shields from the Idaean Cave.This cup falls into our LG/EO transitional stage, as does the cup 132.24 with its linked lotus, and the pithos 218.24 on which the metopes are occupied by two quartered lozenges, a guilloche, and linked Phoenician palmettes.

COLDSTREAM comment. The shapes tend to be slimmer, and usually have only two handles. Metopes are rare, except on a small scale and flanking a long and narrow central panel. Decoration is more restrained, and only rarely extends below the handles. Meanders and battlements persist from Atticizing MG stock, but in increasingly emaciated form and in thin horizontal strips. These are combined, from the local repertoire, with billets, cables, horizontal S's and tongues; thin vertical leaves, usually hatched, are a LG novelty. The painter of H io, to whom four other pithoi can be attributed,669 regularly alternates pairs of leaves with piles of chevron; a wide variety in the shapes, as also of those painted by the hand of O 19 in the Bird workshop, implies that in LG a single painter could - unlike his MG predecessor - work for more than one potter. In late LG there is a tendency towards fussy miniaturism in the main decoration, which is often framed by horizontal and vertical rows of small concentric circles in white-on- dark. For LG the following useful contexts can be added to those noted in F.670 The pithos 163.3, from the Bird workshop, was the only urn found in its tomb. Other urns with undisturbed contents amounted to seven for late LG, and three for the LG/EO transitional stage,671 to which T. 78, the rich infant inhumation in a coarse pithos, also belongs. These associations, together with evidence from style, throw light on the repertoire of smaller LG shapes. LG urns are closed by either conical or domed lids. The former, with inverted cones for knob handles, often carry no decoration other than bands and lines (type D). Low domed lids, without handles, are more ornate and frequently bear several zones of white-on-dark motifs (type B); those with an octopus at the centre, as we have seen, may have been made in the Bird workshop. A small and slim type of neck-handled amphora, already known in MG, persists into this phase (type E). Related to it in shape is the tall and elegant lekythos of Praisos type (D (ii)), sparsely decorated, and made in the same cream-slipped fabric as the non- Atticizing domed lids of MG. Small unguent shapes include dark-ground globular aryballoi with triangles continuing from MG, and Brock's 'Creto-Cypriot' lekythoi (C (iii-iv)), sophisticated adaptations of Cypriot BoR imports, which continue through EO. Another imported Cypriot shape to inspire accomplished imitations is the BoR oinochoe, its flanks swathed in large concentric circles (type F). Of the smaller pouring vessels, especially common in MG are the juglets bearing several rows of dots (jug, type C), some of which may go back to MG. LG kraters are rare among our finds, as they were in F. The high-handled example 75.182, an enlarged kantharos, is unique in Crete and may have Argive connections: 229.3, an enlarged skyphos, represents the usual LG type. Low-based skyphoi continue, though less frequent in our tombs than during MG. An alternative drinking vessel, the kotyle, makes its Knossian debut in this phase, and in 229.19 we have a faithful local copy of the earliest Corinthian LG prototype, with vertical chevrons. Of the various types of cup we have noted the large and deep vessels with metopal decoration, from the Bird workshop; there are also many smaller LG versions, E (i), with reserved panels. Also plentiful here, although extremely rare in F., is type E (ii) bearing a zone of thick and thin vertical bars. Alongside these decorated versions, the large coated cups continue, now more crisply thrown (D (iii)), and often attaining an egg-shell delicacy of fabric; these continue into EO with taller lips and deeper bodies. 669 See p. 321, n. 56. ™GGP2^. 671 LG, late: 75.68, 75.7a, 104.3, "04.4, 126.1, 218.57, 218.64.

Normal Technique The neckless ovoid pithos which began to replace earlier shapes during EG continues into the Orientalizing period, at first retaining G patterns among the truly O motifs - the distinction is, in any case, often a blurred one in Crete - and, except for one class, tending to become smaller. The circle pithoi classed by Brock as the 'poor man's pithos' overlap with, and eventually replace those in the G tradition; contemporary with them are the more expensive polychrome pithoi. The necked pithos, out of fashion since the end of EG, has a modest O revival, and there is a single straight-sided example. A. IN THE G TRADITION Ovoid, neckless, two or four handles. Two handles: EO: 132.8, 75.192, 75.206. MO: 175*42« Four handles: EO: 292.146, 283.53, 75.172, i75*43&gt; i4-46* MO: 107.211, 294*38, 218.10. LO: 107.112. Fragmentary: EO: 107.192, 26.19, 123.1, 107.213, 159.1, 306.36. MO: 132.31, 60.23, 60.29. As in LG, four-handled pithoi are in the majority, but they are best discussed with two- handled. Apart from 292.146, which has a fenestrated conical foot, and 26.19 and 283.53 with tripod feet, all of them are orthodox in shape. They are generally a little larger than circle pithoi, and the general tendency is to become slimmer. Only one appears to be LO. The earliest, both fragmentary, 107.192 and 26.19, are extremely worn; their handle panels are arranged in metopes. 26.19 begins to show the EO vertical guilloche; evidence of partial repainting as a polychrome pithos suggests that it is extremely early. The three-metope system, but with a greater variety of ornament (283.53) is the favoured arrangement, though there are exceptions (107.211 with its crudely-drawn birds in the sun). Towards the middle of the series the metopes become equal in size (132.8, 75.193) and more numerous, and panels are often divided horizontally instead of vertically, especially if more complex band patterns are being used (175.43). Circles, other than white ones, appear later in the series, in general as part of a somewhat simpler pattern (75.206, 60.23) and may become florals (294.38).</page><page sequence="139">422 ELIZABETH MOIGNARD 2i8.io, the latest, has single panels, with the circles between Trees of Life framed by verticals on a pot very clearly related to contemporary circle pithoi. 107.112, the sole LO pithos of this class, is by the same hand as Gypsades no. 70 and bears the same guilloche panels. Both look back to the extremely ornate pithoi of our class B, classified by Brock as being in the bulky MG tradition.672 White circles appear framing the panels (292.146) and then on bands lower down the body, and later in pairs or singly; on the LO 107.112 they have the thickened outer circle which appears on Gypsades no. 70. 123. 1 and 159. 1 bear panels of white cross-hatching and zigzag on some of their lower bands as well as circles; the circles alone are a later trait. B. BULKY Tripod feet, elaborate patterns. EO: 107.29, 107.116. Both these, in the same tomb, are by the same hand; a third was found in the Teke tholos.673 116 is fragmentary, the others have tripod feet and the bulky shape of Brock's classification. All three have elaborately subdivided panels and mix G with essentially O ornament. 107.29 and the Teke pithos both carry a continuous band of quadrated squares and triple verticals below the handles. Jewellery pattern, circles with voluted lozenges in the centre, and vertical cable are favourite motifs. C. CIRCLE PITHOI Ovoid, two or four handles; dark on light, or vice-versa, or both. Two handles: EO: 19*139 106.38, 106.37, IO7'24&gt; 294-59&gt; X4«79 75*I74- LO: 107.12, 107.13, 292.29, 126.13.

Very few of these come from contexts which allow us to date them, and many are fragmentary; there is a considerable variety of shape and technique within the group. Shape changes do not appear to be a regular development, and so the chronology above is tentative. 1. 1 6 is probably the earliest, with massed circles, small bordering a larger one, in square handle panels; the arrangement of the decoration links it with classes A and B, and its double- reed vertical handle is a throwback to EG pithoi such as G 8.674 19.13 is probably the next in the series; its white on dark decoration of large and small circles with elaborate filling links it with 106.38, probably by the same hand. Two-handled pithoi with the circles in a reserved panel seem later, and 107.12 and 13, with large sets of circles in such a panel, in both cases with blank centres to the circles, are perhaps just LO. Both are smaller than their predecessors. 292.29 and 126.13 are both light ground with circles in bands. Apart from 1.16, the four-handled pithoi all bear their circles in a reserved panel. Small circles may combine with large ones (107. 115 and 75.193). 107.6, a small pithos with spokes 672 F. 149, class IV B. See GGP254, n. 9. b/J USA 49 (1954) pl. 21.7. 674 G ovoid pithoi type A.

The circles may be embellished: 292.27, which also has tripod feet, here perhaps copied from contemporary polychromes, has tongues between its pairs of circles, and also carries vertical columns of white circles on the main body band. 75.8, one of the few LO pithoi of this class, overlaps its circles, and has a space between inner and outer sets - an O trait, and in this case a late one. 294.36 has elaborate white dots and bees between its circles. D. NECKED PITHOI Two or four handles, body shape ranges from high-shouldered to sagging. (i) In the G tradition EO: 19*149 13*469 7^*4* LO: 13.3. (ii) Circles Two handles: EO: 19*79 40.32, 294.14, 30.7. LO: 25.5, 40.33. Four handles: EO: 292.158. LO: 75-355 i3«-i4j 56-3°- These, like their neckless counterparts, are difficult to place in a chronological series. 19. 14,675 with its metopes in white on dark paint is early, as is its partner with the circles 19.7. 40.33 and 75.359e76 both light ground, and in the case of 40.33, reminiscent of circle jugs,677 are probably later. 56.30, an extremely bulky and crude pithos, is more like its cousins at Arkades678 than any in the N Cemetery; it comes from an LO complex of tombs which was largely populated with polychrome pithoi. 292.158 is the only real maverick in this series, in being very large, with decoration in a reserved handle zone. It might be seen as a counterpart of the bulky pithoi of class B, but its decoration is much freer and bolder: huge Trees of Life, hatched and dotted lozenges, dotted arcading. The trees suggest an EO date, but the spirit of the painting is reminiscent of PGB and EG, of which there are some bold examples from the same tomb. E. STRAIGHT-SIDED Sloping shoulder, convex body. EO: 306.10. Straight-sided pithoi went out of fashion at Knossos after EG,679 although they lasted much longer at Arkades, usually in a much more angular form than this one.680 This single example 675 Cf.

Its white on dark decoration of circles link it with the early ovoid pithoi in the EO series, such as 19*139 and the band of panels with lozenge trees and birds with the later vases of the Bird workshop.681 F. COARSE PITHOI (i) Necked, strap handles from shoulder to neck EO: 104.1, 98.21, 107.3, 76.1, 40.1. LO: 69-2, 34.16, 60.6, 294.5, 292.238, 40.46. (ii) Straight-sided EO: 107.10. Few of the coarse pithoi are complete enough to reconstruct. They are of a taller, narrower shape than the EO ones in the Fortetsa tombs, with a more sharply offset neck. In general, grouped grooves on the body are a feature of the earlier ones here, and stamped circles of varying sizes, often along the vertical edge of the lip, later, although there are G examples.682 104.1 and 98.21 are very like their G counterparts such as i8.8, though leaner. 34*10 appears in a wholly LO tomb, and continues the small stamped circles. The latest, 40.46, has a stamped pattern of lotus chain, rosettes and tongues, a far more elaborate pithos than is at all usual in this coarse group, and much more like the large series of big relief pithoi.683 Here, as in the Fortetsa tombs, their place was probably largely taken by the circle pithoi. The straight-sided pithos 107.10, like its fine counterpart 306.10, is a revival of the old PGB and EG shape. The grouped grooves, made with the fingertips, suggest an EO date. G. MISCELLANEOUS LO: 82.12, 98.6. Both these fragments appear to come from large closed vessels, and are perhaps best discussed here. 82.12 has large animals, presumably in a frieze, with incised outlines which, together with the style of drawing, produce an effect like an expanded Corinthian animal-style vessel - close to black figure. 98.6 has a frieze of figures dancing and holding snakes, produced by stamping, with some parts of the figures applied in paint. The nearest parallel for this is only for the figures, which are very like those of cut-out metal plaques of the late seventh or early sixth century,684 and is probably contemporary with them. II. Polychrome Pithoi The polychrome cremation pithos is a new development at Knossos in the Orientalizing period, although its shape and decoration owe much to its predecessors and contemporaries in 681 GGP 246 flf.

Although there are many polychrome pithoi from our site, many of them are fragmentary or have lost their fugitive decoration completely. Tomb 285, largely undisturbed, allowed a view of the MO and LO pithoi; nothing in this tomb is as late as the last pithoi from tombs 75 and 57, all apparently by the same hand. In general the strap foot with prong marks continues later than the reeded type;686 the earliest examples are the largest, and the latest have high shoulders and a strong taper. In our series, at least, the elegant narrow ovoid shape is an MO trait. 685 E i5of. 686 f. I52.</page><page sequence="143">426 ELIZABETH MOIGNARD Our series begins with early experiments with shape and technique. 107.28 is a large and extremely thin-walled pithos on a solid stand;687 not a trace of the decoration remains. 48.14, a similar pithos, had simple circles. 292.184, rather later, finds its closest parallel for shape in F. no. 1352: its dotted circles and rosettes suggest that it is rather later. 75.222, a very large bulky pithos with strap feet, must belong in the G tradition of its bulky contemporaries in the normal technique;688 it is decorated in blue and white only, with circled rosettes, meander patterns and Trees of Life, all patterns which appear on non-polychrome pithoi of the period.689 107.57 is decorated in blue and yellow only, but in a distinctly LO manner in panels with hatched squares, suggesting that experiment continued late. 292.186 is decorated with blue bands with white circles on them, very like an ordinary circle pithos. Three pithoi display trichrome decoration;690 14*14 and 292.42 have touches of yellow as borders or rosette centres. 82.1, a later vase with animals in panels, uses yellow for the wing of its sphinx. We might think of 106.9 as the earliest orthodox polychrome pithos; its paint, fortunately, is virtually intact. Like its counterparts in the normal technique, its handle panels are arranged as a main panel between ancillaries, and there are two distinct designs on each side. The other two pattern bands are continuous, with wheels, bee lotuses, and squares of chequer-board. Distribution of red and blue is about equal, and the whole appearance of the vase is complex and even-textured. 229.7 an^ 306.35 give very much the same effect; 306.33 has alternating filled and void panels, which suggests that it comes somewhere near the end of the EO series, and looks forward to the MO pairs from tomb 285, 33 and 36, and 40 and 41. Payne noticed the existence of duplicated or companion pieces in the Orientalizing period,691 and in tomb 285 there are several such pairs, and indeed in tombs 57 and 75. 285.40 and 41 and 33 and 36 are linked as pairs by elements in their decoration. 40 and 41 both carry continuous red and blue chequer-board at the top and arcades at the bottom. 41 has no true handle panels, but bold red and blue zigzags. 40 has one band of alternating filled and void panels, 41 a continuous lotus and palmette frieze. Both had the by now standard cup-shaped lid with rings like cauldron handles. 33 and 36, less elegant in outline, also experiment. Both have lids with processions of birds, both bear large tongues in different places, both have chevrons on the legs. LO pairs and groups also appear in tombs 285, 57 and 75, and here the same hand is detectable at work on several vases. 34.5 and 285.27 have distinctive red and blue hatched squares, rosette panels between the feet, and meander legs as continuous bands below the rim. A different hand painted the tripartite group 285.12, 13, and 24; 12 and 13 were potted by the same hand too. A perceptibly simpler repertoire of patterns is beginning to emerge: 285.13 and 24 have red triangles as rays in the band above the feet; they appear again on 57.9, which also bears the lozenge and chequer-board which reappear on 285.24. 57.10, 75.7 and 75.20 are virtual duplicates, clearly all by the same hand, which has reverted to continuous bands of pattern rather than panels. The shape is by now fatter, with a higher shoulder line. 82.5 is perhaps the very latest of our series, decorated simply with red and blue meander-legs. There are no examples of the latest very red style noticed by Brock.692 687 Cf. Payne no. 59 and Ay Paraskies, 55, fig. 6 no. 21. 688 Cf. 107.29. 689 Cf.

The technique is reminiscent of the Arkades reserving style,693 though without the incision, and with a more precise control of contour. Lids I. Domed The domed lids of the N Cemetery are either of the well-known shield type with an everted flat rim, or of a hemispherical shape which appears in EG and MG, though decorated somewhat differently.694 The white-on-dark examples continue the LG shape.

Most have, if the rim is preserved, a pair of suspension holes, like those from other sites. The rim is often everted, quite sharply in many EO examples, flatter in MO. Dome-profiles tend to be higher and rounder early in the series, flatter and ridged later. The LG/EO type with massed circles,696 usually with grouped strokes or billets on the rim, appears again here (13.47, I4*32j 75* 108, 285.72, 285.117, 285.130). Early lids often have tongues, usually grouped as a central rosette (19.24) and a band of zigzag is an early feature too (19.25). Grouped lines tend to be later, and so does the habit of breaking up single zones into panels of pattern (218.76) or spacing isolated motifs in a single zone (107.31). There are two variants, both LO, both of which have a knob in the form of a head. 107.124 has an animal head, now extremely worn, and a sharply everted rim, which makes it very like the small class of polychrome lids III D.697 107.127 has a Daedalic head. This has retained the earlier tongue-pattern, but has a volute arcade between the zones of tongues. The head is an exceptionally finely modelled example of around 640. 698 693 Boardman CCO 145, with n. 2. 694 Gypsades nos. 34 and 35; here pp. 328-9, types A (i)-(ii). 695 F. 163, class E (i) (b). 696 Cf.

NORMAL TECHNIQUE (i) Domed, with rim. EO: X4*44» 14*28, 294.27. All three of these bear a strong resemblance in their decoration to a pair tentatively placed by Coldstream in EG/MG (see n. 694 above) but these are smaller. 14*44, wi^1 *ts thicker fabric and a more sharply everted rim is the earliest. The other two follow the pattern of their white on dark contemporaries. Both have painted rims, and suspension holes appear in that of 14.28. (ii) Hemispherical EO: 75-76&gt; 75-535 75-7°&gt; 75-I45&gt; 75-I5«&gt; i3-3«&gt;* 28.20. This shape appears to be peculiar, at this period, to the N Cemetery. It recalls the PGB-EG type699 represented here by 107.120, 121, 135 and 292.179, which have a slightly inturned rim with dots on the underside, and are decorated with fine lines. The five lids here from tomb 75, apparently unique to it, have a rounded rim with a slight outward bulge and faintly flattened centre. 75.53, 70 and 145 all carry a Maltese cross on their centres, very like that which appears on some kalathoi used as lids, and on the conical lids which succeeded them.700 There are a number of kalathoi of this sort in tomb 75 (e.g. nos. 48, 54, 77). 13.30 is larger, flatter and also appears in a tomb which has kalathoi of the lid sort: 13.13 has concentric bands, multiple zigzags where our lid has arcs, and a dark rim where 13.30 has a wide dark band at the edge. 28.20 has a high dome and an almost vestigial groove at the rim, reminiscent of EG omphaloid lids. The combination of different sizes of circle and of dots in the central zone of the large ones suggests EO. (iii) Central boss EO: 107.140 This is the single O example in the N Cemetery of the class F. 167, E (ii) (a).701 Like the lids of class B (i), they recall the EG omphaloid type; tomb 107 has two MG descendants of this, nos. 90 and 91. II. Conical Conical lids, in the N Cemetery as elsewhere, are the standard form of lid for the cremation pithos. As most of the EO pithoi which carry them are smaller than their LG counterparts the lids are generally smaller too. There are a few LO members of this class,702 but most of the lids are EO, and as most of them have been separated irretrievably from their pithoi the sequence which appears below is tentative. Several different shapes were current at once. 699 See pp. 364-5, Small Lids, B (ii). 700 See F. 162. For conical lids see Gypsades nos. 4, 5, and our 292.174. 701 Cf.

The stemmed knob is a continuation of the G shape with a knob handle on a ridged stem.703 In LG the knob, which had had a cross-pattern, acquires circles instead,704 and the lid itself has bands and lines to match the pithos. 107.100 and 46 continue this tradition for large and bulky pithoi; they are by the same hand, and both have a petal rosette on the knob, rather than circles. The fabric of 60.27 is finer than that of the others, and it has an exaggeratedly tall stem to its knob and a sharper slope to its cone, which suggests that it comes close to the only LO lid of this class, 60.25. Here the fabric is thin, and the lid curved in profile. The stem has a slight ridge and the knob is reserved on its upper surface. The tongues and volute-arcade are an interesting variant on the usual decorative scheme.

This class, one of the most numerous EO lid types, is subject to the most internal variation of shape. The knob is low and stemless, but may be flat and virtually continuous with the lid, which is often, then, rather larger, or it may be defined as an inverted cone, though still stemless. Both types seem to be concurrent; they bear bands and lines or circles, and they may be white on dark. The lids require little individual comment: 75*149* a wide, flat lid, in quite a refined fabric, appears to be the earliest; 60.1, with a hollow knob and bands and lines, the latest. In general the later lids have a taller profile and are smaller. 294.40 and 107.161, both light-ground, have a knob relating to the stemmed type, with a distinct overhang. (iii) Central boss EO: 218.124, 75.1865 107.7. This class is a variant on the previous one; in general its members are small and in thin fabric. The first two have bands and lines, 218.124 with single lines. 107.7 has an interesting ogee shape, the knob continuous with the lid. 703 Cf.

This large lid is extremely close to the polychrome lid F. no. 878, but is in the normal technique, bands and lines with white circles on the central band. It descends from the class of big G lids with miniature vessels for knobs.707 III. Polychrome Polychrome lids begin by bearing a strong resemblance to their counterparts among the non- polychrome classes, but gradually develop distinctive shapes of their own, particularly the cup knob with a pair of cauldron-rings, related to the G lids with a miniature vessel for a handle (conical, type B), but peculiar to polychrome.

UNCLASSIFIED EO: 14.5, 14.22, 106.35. LO: 82.6. Most of the polychrome lids in the N Cemetery are too fragmentary to permit discussion. The majority of these adequately preserved are the MO and LO ones with pithoi from tomb 285, and a few later ones from tombs 56 and 57. The conical type with a cup knob and rings708 is here later than other shapes, apart from the two EO ones above. Most lids are designed to complement their pithoi or add to the decorative effect. 75.196 is a big thick-walled lid which probably had a thick disc knob on a stem like its counterparts in the MG tradition (cf. 107.46, type II (i)), and it bears the circles on bands which match its blue and white pithos 707 F. 164, class G (i); here pp. 325-6, type B. 708 F. 164, class G (ii) (b).</page><page sequence="148">THE ORIENTALIZING POTTERY 43I 75*222* 106.12, a more delicate lid with a flat disc knob, bears the hatched panels which are repeated on its pithos 106*9 as Part °f the handle-zone complexes, and its panel bands. 306*34 carries the guilloche which also appears on the pot 306.33. 107.216 and 217 are both decorated in blue and yellow, and have a flat conical knob. Both carry yellow leaves; one must belong to the blue and yellow pithos 107.57. The most interesting polychrome lids with cup-knobs and rings are the MO group from tomb 285; 34 and 35 carry delightful processions of birds; those on 34709 echo those on the handle panels of its pithos, 285.33, and the partridges of 37 add to the fauna of 285.36. The other MO pithoi are perhaps less adventurous: the arcades on 285.53 echo those on its pithos 41, and the stripes and leaves of 56 add to the variety of the pithos 40. LO lids of this class are bolder and simpler. They have a more curved profile, and the rings are higher and thinner. 285.15, 16 and 25 all have a small torus between the cup and the lid. All of them carry the same guilloche border, connected by slanting rays to the knob, as does 57.11. These are all by the same hand, as are their pithoi. 82.6 carries the red and blue meander-legs which appear on its pithos, 82.5. Some of the fragmentary lids give tantalising glimpses of more complex decoration: 106.35 with its lotus-bees and lozenges, and the tartan effect of 292.200, unfortunately unconnected with a pithos, but by the same hand as 34*3* Finally, the group of lids from tomb 14 with 107*38, with a griffin protome for a knob and a sharply everted rim. Those from T 14 do not fit pithoi; in view of their resemblance to the bronze shields from the Idaean Cave710 with protome centres, they were presumably intended to hang on the wall, suspended by the holes in their rims, like white-on-dark domed lids. The blue griffin painted on 14.15 and the bird on 107*38 echo the repoussé animals which appear on the bronzes. Other animal protomes, 14*8 (bull), 40*42 (cock), 294*9 (ram or goat), are from similar lids. IV. Cylindrical (i) Polychrome LO: 281*1, 56.28, 75.11, 107.208, 285.18, 285.19, 285.31. With the exception of 281. 1, which has triangles on the side, these are all striped in red and blue on the usual cream slip. They are rare, but not peculiar to the N Cemetery.711 As the top surface is unpainted, it is probable that they are, in fact, bowls. 285.18 and 19 were a pair, with the LO pithoi 12 and 13. They may fill the function of the lekanis, of which there are no fine decorated examples after EO in the N Cemetery. (ii) Normal technique EO: 65.7.

EO: 229.32, F/67.1.9. This is a better known class of cylindrical lid, probably with a strap handle across the top, as F. no. 1 2 18, on a circle pithos. It is not a very common type in E (iv) Conical top LO: 56-35- LO-A: 3°-9* These are not a normal type at Knossos, but a pithos similar to 56.30 at Arkades bears a lid very like 56.35. 712 30.9 belongs to the pyxis 30.8, and perhaps this type of lid began to be current at Knossos too towards the end of the seventh century. (v) Miscellaneous LO: 106.41. This is an unusual trefoil lid with a barred handle, presumably local, and probably designed to fit an oinochoe, though almost certainly not the only surviving Ó example in T. 106, no. 15, which is too early if our lid follows the Corinthian prototype designed for a flat-bottomed oinochoe.

Amphorae of the O period are not common; they generally occur in domestic contexts in a fragmentary state.713 They usually have a more angular mouth than their G predecessors, and are often narrower and taller. There are only two in the N Cemetery in complete enough a state to tell us more than we already know. 292.44 is extremely large and heavy, in a creamy- surfaced fabric with a high polish very like that of some LG Praisos lekythoi.714 The fabric and the band of metopes at the join of neck and shoulder, with guilloche, lozenges, tree and wheels suggest an early EO date. 107.70 alternates large and small sets of concentric circles, a pattern which appears on some circle pithoi (cf. 75.193). The others all use circles as the main element of decoration, in white or black. 218.73,715 a smaller amphora than the rest, arranges the circles as an asymmetrical grouping on the neck; there are cross-strokes in the outermost space of each set, perhaps a later feature too. 712 Arkades ñe. 287. 713 See BSA 68 (1973) 37, nos. 10-11 (EO), 42, nos. 5-9 and 44 no. 4 (LO) and BSA 73 (1978) 45, nos. 1-3. 714 Cf. 202.80, 102. 715 Cf.

(ii) Imported 292.22. 292.212 shows a revival of bucchero, which seems to have re-emerged716 after a heyday in MG. Our fragment has a handle root which suggests a shape much like those in class A. The complete amphoriskos 292.22 is a duplicate of F. no. 1403, which Brock records as an import of unknown origin, though its fabric is not unlike Cypriot. Ours is in a brown-black fabric which appears more Phoenician than Cypriot, but it has not been possible to find a parallel for it. F . no. 1403 appeared in an EO context. T. 292 was too disturbed for certainty about the context of ours, but EO is likely here too. C. SMALL BELLY AMPHORA A: 104.103. The Archaic amphora 104.103 is Atticizing, following late seventh century amphorae of the type used by the Nessos Painter,717 with a curved lip rather than a square one, and the handles well down on the shoulder. Ours need not date from much, if at all, after about 600 BC; it indicates a disturbance of an essentially G and EO tomb after a gap of about 60 years. Hydriai The hydria was popular as a funerary gift at Knossos from PGB onwards, but went out of fashion in MG, although it did not disappear completely. In the O period it was more common in domestic contexts,718 and its function was always partly overlapped by the round- mouthed jug. Its shape undergoes very little modification until the O period, when its centre of gravity is pushed upwards, at least in those without the secondary spout. Both shapes relate to the narrow-necked oinochoe. A. STANDARD EO: 107.17, 14. 11. LO: 287.41. The miniature 107.17 retains very much the original PGB shape,719 with an ovoid body, low side- handles, a narrow neck, and a straight edge to the lip. It also has the bracket ornament common on domestic hydriai, appearing in F. on aryballoi and small jugs as well as hydriai,720 as it does on 716 E.g. the aryballoi O 23, 34*37, 107.84, 121, 122, and the pyxis 107.78. 717 E.g.

Both 14. 11, and, more exaggeratedly, 287.41, have a tapering, ovoid body; 14. 11 comes to a plain flat base. All three divide the body into bands; the two earlier hydriai resemble the LG/EO example, Payne no. 73, in having isolated decorative features in these bands. 14. n, particularly, with its volute trees, is close both to Payne's hydria and F. no. 913. 287.41 keeps the bracket pattern, but suspends it between rosettes and fills it with circles, which suggests a later date, as does its resemblance in shape to the oinochoe Payne no. 79, which is probably somewhat later than the EO date he gives it. There may also be a link with some of the later Creto-cypriot lekythoi which have a torus between the body and the foot.721 B. WITH SUPERNUMERARY PLASTIC SPOUT MO: 107.8, 292.5. Hydriai and jugs with plastic spouts in the form of animal heads are already well-documented in central Crete, especially at Arkades.722 Our two both retain the ovoid body of the earlier hydria shape,723 and the narrow neck and spread mouth. Both appear to be a little later than Payne no. 74 with a similar spout, though 107.8 has a large single meander as part of the main body-band, combined with guilloche, lozenges and the volute trees which are a regular feature of hydria decoration at Knossos. 292.5, smaller and more globular, is a little later; it retains the tree on its neck, and arcaded tongues, a later feature, replace it on the shoulder.

Oinochoai of this class724 are less numerous than the equivalent round-mouthed jugs. They show the same progression from globular to ovoid, and a similar growth in size. Again, outermost circles and lines tend to be thickened, and this appears to happen a little sooner on oinochoai (98.3) than it does on jugs. 40.37 and 75.210 have their shoulder circles close together, as on some contemporary or near-contemporary aryballoi.725 75.210 has eyes on the lip, a genuinely Cypriot feature,726 although this is a local shape. 40.4 has the wide shallow mouth characteristic of LO narrow-necked oinochoai. 721 Cf.

This oinochoe is extremely difficult to classify, but its body-shape and the tongue-petals on its shoulder perhaps give it a place here. It is by now very far removed from a Corinthian prototype, especially in view of its thick disc foot, and its lines and bands are very Knossian, but it is perhaps worth noticing its shape beside that of the Corinthian LPC /Transitional aryballos 59.2, found with it.

This is perhaps the most varied class of LO oinochoai; the earliest are close to the Cypriot prototype with side circles,733 and transverse banding on the shoulder, of which there are genuine Cypriot examples in the N Cemetery: 229.11 is one. 40.29 copies the banding and the double-rib handle closely, though the neck is already rather taller than that of its prototype, and beneath the handle is a very Knossian lotus and bee.734 From here almost all the other members of this class depart rapidly from the prototype: 292.181 has its circles arranged to intersect at regular distances, 48.15 has a floral necklace and lozenges in the spaced circles. 60.20 and 21 have smaller circles within the larger ones. 60.11 is an adaptation of the Cypriot type with a transverse barrel body,735 copied much less in Crete,736 but has, as usual, departed some way from its original in the decoration.

The Wild Goat oinochoe 56.11 is a fine example of the Middle style, dating from around 630, with outlined lotus buds at the base. The quality of the drawing is delicate, and the filling ornament even. It is one of the late imports742 in this LO tomb which contained a number, including 56.8. Apparently of Naxian fabric (p. 481 = K 103), it is related in style to Wild Goat and Chian, though simpler in its drawing. The curious tooth-pattern under its handle echoes the similar pattern found on Wild Goat and related vases,743 but the octopus is a curiosity; native Cretan octopods are extinct on vases by the end of LG/EO.744 Corinthian Ovoid, EPC: 13.6, 34.9, 34.13, 56.24.

In the present state of survival, Corinthian pots from other parts of the cemetery are extremely sporadic and fragmentary. The linear style ovoid oinochoai 13.6, 34.9, 34.13 and 56.24 are by far the earliest of our seventh century imports,745 earlier than the local pottery in Ts. 34 and 56, in which they were placed presumably as finer and more valuable offerings, perhaps later than their acquisition. 34.9 and 34*13 were perhaps intended as a pair. The Transitional items are varied in style and quality: 56.20 is rough, and the animals are not well-drawn;746 only the tongues on the shoulder are incised. The flat- bottomed oinochoe 101.1 is more detailed, and escapes the same degree of crudity by being on a larger scale.747 107.145 is an altogether better piece of work with a fine boar748 in its central frieze. 126. 11 is beginning to show signs of mass-production in its amoeba-like rosettes.749 Jugs a. round-mouthed Body globular to ovoid, cylindrical handle.

Brock noted the appearance of these on MG and PGB vases,752 but never on a jug, and not as late as this. Jugs are, however, anthropomorphized in Greek and Near Eastern fabrics from the Bronze Age onwards, and nipples are a common feature, even by themselves. Circles filled with lozenge rosettes link our jug both to polychrome pithoi, and to some of the later oinochoai and aryballoi derived from Cypriot jugs.753 285.5 has an animal spout, another Creto-cypriot feature,754 and single lines. 75.8 is merely a dark-ground version with white lines, and circles which have now worn off. B. SQUAT Round mouth, reeded handle. LO: 13.5, 25.6, 56.31, 56.12. The shape of these relates them to similarly shaped O vases from other Greek sites: 56.12, the latest in the series, is particularly reminiscent of East Greek squat jugs,755 although the incised details of its animals owe a more immediate debt to Corinth. It must be roughly contemporary with the sphinx alabastron F. no. 1299. 13.5 and 25.6, painted by the same hand, related to the Forte tsa Painter,756 are far cruder and slightly earlier, though of the same shape. On both we have a purely local metope arrangement on the shoulder, badly planned in the case of 13.5, and a central band of pattern at the waist of the pot. 13.5 has a very East Greek corbel at the base of the handle. The blobby LG rosette and rectilinear cable, also seen on the alabastron 40.22 by the same hand, appears on both. C. GIANT LEKYTHOI Collared neck, disc mouth. EO: 75-IO3- LO: 57.5. These two jugs, shaped like a giant Creto-cypriot lekythos, differ in their decorative arrangement. 75.103 has the side-circles, with small ones front and back and the splayed strokes at the root of the handle which also appear on the lekythos 219.64. The side circles are spaced and the centre has a cross-hatched lozenge-rosette very like some of the later Creto-cypriot aryballoi. 57.5 is considerably later, and has a strap handle rather than a cylindrical one. The pattern is treated horizontally rather than vertically, as are our lekythoi of class B. The pattern has a parallel on a Cretan jug found at Tocra,757 which is rather later in date. 752 E.g.

(ii) Fully coated EO: 218.14. 218.13 was found with the EO pithos 218.10, and although it has strokes dependent from the neck, a throwback to PG, its elegant ovoid body relates it to the other two light-ground examples, which are certainly O. 75.114 is perceptibly fatter than 19.4, but both of them have the bands and concentric circles which are common on contemporary globular jugs. The outermost circle of each group on 19.4 is thickened, another EO trait. 218.14, also found with 218.10, is very like 218.13, with the slightly angular shoulder, and is best regarded as a dark ground version of the same shape. B. COARSE EO: 107.16. This gritty small olpe belongs with the group 107.15-20, which perhaps went with a child burial. Its continuous profile and sagging belly relate it closely to Brock's class F. 155, class C (ii). It appears to have been unpainted, and to be later than the rest of its associated pots, to which it may have been added in the process of tidying for a later burial. C.

Our two olpai were among the latest imports, both LPC /Transitional but in different styles. 34.1 is in the black incised style;758 its figures are grotesque human-canine hybrids, perhaps to appeal to Cretan taste. 56.2 is much more conventional, with an animal band and scale pattern.759 Lekythoi A.

Spaced side-circles are perhaps slightly later (107.53), but, as always, variations on the scheme appear: 292.195 has billets in the interruption between the circles, like its aryballos counterpart 218.86, and dotted squares at the edges of its side- circles. More dots appear in its small circles. The three lekythoi with handle to mouth have a parallel in F. no. 1052, though these are slightly later and more ovoid.

The first five Praisos lekythoi in this class, like the eponymous piece from Praisos,763 are white- on-dark, and are all EO, contemporary with the straight-sided pyxides from tomb 104, which their pattern-work resembles, especially 75.209 with its bird. All of them are rather worn; the decorative schemes are very similar: dotted crossed zigzags, quadrated lozenges, leaf-crosses and circles, guilloche, and it is highly likely that they came from the same workshop. 75.209 is very close to the Bird Group.764 Alabastra a. trefoil-mouthed juglet A continuation of the Creto-cypriot type already found in MG.765 EO: I75-Í45 Io7-37» 292.35. This shape, derived from the Cypriot White-Painted IV juglet,766 comes to an end in EO, perhaps to be replaced by Class B. Neither is particularly common.

Circles begin to replace hatched triangles in LG,776 and all but one of our O examples are EO, after which they were presumably replaced by those with the dark lower body, class D. The shape once again moves from a sagging lower body (107.68) to a tauter shape with a higher centre of gravity (283.82). The single LO example, 285.44 is distinctly higher-shouldered, and has the dark lower body. The grouped lines on the body may have had the outermost thickened (107.68, 306.20) as on contemporary pithoi and oinochoai, and the circles may be double or triple (306.5), grouped as a pair at the front of the shoulder with one set on either side, or singly (75.190). T. 75, which already had a pair of black aryballoi 16 and 28, also had a pair of circle aryballoi, 89 and 90 which were found in pithos 68, and so were intended as a pair. The small group of variants 107.41, 218.3 and 292.34 are all EO, and combine a wide variety of ornament with the light-ground scheme and lines. 218.3 in particular, with its precise globular body and delicate patterns, looks forward to the more complex LO examples, as does 292.34, although its chevron-columns perhaps indicate cross-fertilisation from Creto- cypriot lekythoi with chevrons.777 218.18 and 218.136 are perhaps best classed as early members of this group. 218.18 bears a star on its shoulder, as do the miniature Praisos lekythos 218.120 and the miniature oinochoe 218.101, a feature perhaps suggested by BoR-influenced aryballoi like 292.209, which may also have inspired the squashy shape of 218.136. 229.23, the single white-on-dark member of the class, follows other shapes in varying the technique but keeping the decorative scheme. 75.124, the latest of the group, borrows the chevrons from Creto-cypriot aryballoi or lekythoi once again, for a radiating shoulder-pattern; it looks forward to the LO types of classes D, E and E 775 F. 157-8, class B. 776GGP253, n. 9. 777 Cf. 106.5.</page><page sequence="162">THE ORIENTALIZING POTTERY I53 The miniatures from tomb 14 are a pair; the wheel decoration is a variant on the circle. 14.19 is more complex, but still a clear variant of this type, with a cable in place of the topmost of the upper group of lines; the grouped strokes and squiggle pendent from the neck recall the tongue-like strokes found on some earlier jugs.778 D. DARK LOWER BODY EO: 107.187. MO: 285*549 285.55. LO: 75-21* 285.29, 75.24, 56.29, 34.25, 56.3, 13.2, 285.28, 285.20. Brock classed these aryballoi with dark lower bodies as exclusively LO,779 but earlier than classes E and F,780 with all-over decoration. Our tombs have two which are probably earlier; they appear to be a logical development from class B. The aryballoi in this class are very variable in quality and size, but they progress from the globular to the high-shouldered, and eventually to a late shape with a very wide shoulder (13.2). The examples from T. 285, 28 and 20 were associated with some of the latest polychrome pithoi in that tomb, although these are not the latest in the polychrome series, and this suggests that although class D starts earlier than those decorated all over, it overlaps with them, and continues almost as long. All our examples follow class B by edging the shoulder with fine lines, like the original Corinthian prototype;781 some of them have further fine lines in a group lower down. Shoulder-patterns are extremely varied, ranging from the chevron columns and dot-rosettes of 107.187 and the lotus-bees of 75.21 to a later form of the dot-rosette borrowed from Corinth (13.2) and tongues on the late pair of aryballoi from T. 285, the later of which, 285.20,782 displays the old EO habit of white enhancement of its grouped lines. Tongues become a standard lip-decoration in the middle of the series: 13.2 varies it with lozenges. Tomb 34, which had a number of fine aryballoi, produced the most delicately potted member of the group: 34.25, which reverts to triangles and lozenges on the shoulder, but the triangles are stacked and dotted. 56.29, which has the same pattern, was perhaps originally a pair to it in this confused tomb.

Shapes vary, and so does the quality of the painting. None of these is among the latest aryballoi from our cemetery; apart from 26.10 and 56.4 they are quite large and globular, and some of the decoration is uncomplicated. Bees or bee-lotuses appear again (26.10, 75.218). Among the roughest and most ambitious are the group 75.157, 56.13 and the related lekythos 75.215, by the same hand, which also painted the squat jug 13.5, and the rosette and lozenge aryballos 778 Cf.

The rectilinear cable of 56.13 and 75.157 betray his hand, as do the lotuses of 75. 157, 784 and the thick banding. F. DECORATED ALL OVER MO: 26.8.

The earlier aryballoi are distinctly cruder; the later are the beautiful lace-like work of the Fortetsa Painter. The way in which the decoration is organised is complex from the start. 14.6 uses the metope arrangement dividing the body at the beginning of the series, as does the Fortetsa Painter at the end (19.11, 292.37). 57.2 and 56.1, possibly from the same hand, favour a continuous central band. 292.196 reverts to panels. The repertoire of motifs is much the same as in the other LO classes, rosettes, tongues, cables, lotuses; 292.196 has some birds on its shoulder which are extremely reminiscent of those on some of the later polychrome pithoi.785 As usual, the fineness of the execution distinguishes the Fortetsa Painter, here seen in two different stages on the characteristic eggshell-like fabric of his aryballoi. His favourite bow-like lotus-bees appear on the fragments from T. 292. G. BANDED LO: 285.22, 292.210. These, like F. no. 1530, probably had Corinthian inspiration; certainly banded aryballoi are known at Corinth.786 In T. 285, at any rate, the aryballos appears to belong to the same grave- group as the banded oinochoai 285.14 and 17, just as Tomb P at Fortetsa had one, no. 1519. H. CRETO-CYPRIOT EO: 218.86, 40.8, 106.22, 229.17. This class, all EO, runs parallel to the Creto-cypriot lekythoi in copying or adapting the Cypriot juglet with side-circles,787 or the oinochoe with side-circles and transverse banding,788 but all have the globular aryballos form. 218.86 makes a very creditable attempt to imitate Cypriot fabric. Adaptation is extremely free: 218.86 has the chevron column, but split on either side of a central circle. 229.17 has it topped by a lotus. The circles may be spaced, the outermost thickened, the centre one filled with a rosette (229.17). 40.8 is closest to the prototype from the side, with the transverse banding, but the chevrons have become Payne's bees.789 The group is not numerous, perhaps because the equivalent lekythoi were more popular. 784 Close to the Fortetsa Painter, BSA 56 (1961) 78 ff. 785 Cf.

These are not by the same hand; 292.36 has the favourite blobby rosettes of the painter of 13.5 and the fine-striped aryballoi 56.13 and 75.157. 14*40, with grouped lozenges, has a double at Arkades.790 We also have a lekythos equivalent, 40.8. J. STRAIGHT-SIDED EO: 106.23, 107.40. MO: 26.9. This class is a normal, though not numerous variant, known both at Knossos and Arkades.791 The segmented orange-peel appearance of 26.10 suggests that it is a little later than 106.23, which must correspond to the round aryballoi of class E. 107.40, with its oinochoe mouth, is perhaps best thought of as a member of this class. The eye on the lip is a Cypriot feature often found on oinochoai.792 K. BUCCHERO (i) Globular LO: 107.21, 107.22, 292.46, 34.37, O 22. (ii) Biconical LO: 40.10, 107.84, 292.197, 292.203, 294.8. The four globular aryballoi, comparable to F. no. 983, have fine lines incised from shoulder to foot, perhaps imitating their contemporaries in the normal technique. 107.21 and 22 were found in the paired circle pithoi 107.12 and 13. The biconical type, also paralleled in F. by no. 1326, appear to be rather later; they may bear incised or impressed decoration as the complete one 40.10 does. The entire group seems homogeneous, and may come from the same hand. On the inscribed aryballos 107.84 see A. W.Johnston, pp. 463-4. IMPORTS: CORINTHIAN LPC /Transitional: 59*2. EC: 106.40. In the presence of such a variety of local aryballoi, it is perhaps not surprising that the LO imports are not numerous. Neither is distinguished. 59.2 is a piriform aryballos with running dogs, a very common type;793 106.40, a globular aryballos794 with incised rosettes and dancing figures, hardly less so. 790 Arkades fig. i8q.

There is one example of the miniature pithos, 1 07.59, 795 which requires no special comment. A. GLOBULAR (i) Necked EO: 107.45, 61.3. The globular necked variety of pyxis, seen here in miniature rather than larger sizes, is a development of a type which is found already in EG and MG,796 a local shape which itself develops from a PGB version with a less markedly offset lip.797 The MG version is not unlike the LPG necked pithos,798 which goes out of fashion while the pyxis continues without noticeable alteration. 61.3, in particular, has the zigzags in a reserved panel between the handles which are characteristic of earlier examples. (ii) Depressed inset lip EO: 106. 2, 292.157. LO: 107.78, 40.27. This is probably not a local shape, but may have been imported from Corinth.799 106.2 is an extremely crudely-painted example, with a coarse criss-cross on the body; 292.157 is a more refined example with an elegant scale pattern, which retains its conical, tall-knobbed lid to match. The LO examples are more distinguished. 107.78 is in bucchero, a fabric which appears intermittently at Knossos, and especially in this tomb. It has the same overall shape, but cotton-reel handles on the shoulder and opposed impressed tongues on either side of its equator. Cotton-reel handles appear on some Minoan pyxides,800 but the overall effect is very like Minoan stone vases, especially those which follow Egyptian prototypes.801 40.27, of which only the top is preserved, has pierced lugs and arcaded tongues, a known Knossian motif, but here, perhaps, an imitation in paint of vases like 107.78. B. STRAIGHT-SIDED (i) Fine EO: 104.20, 104.40, 104.41, 107.76. LO-A: 30.8. The straight-sided pyxis was perhaps originally a development of straight-sided jars such as F. no. 163, or perhaps a small version of the straight-sided pithos. The shape which appears here 795 Cf.

The two earliest ones have a metopal system of decoration, separated by columns of lozenge-zigzag in white; 104.20 has elongated birds which suggest that, at any rate chronologically, this pyxis is close to the Bird Group and some dark-ground Praisos lekythoi.804 104.41 has circles as part of its scheme, and is probably a little later. 107.76 is unique, and its drawing without any close parallels. Its shape suggests a date close to the dark pyxides of T. 104, but bears a pastoral scene of figures with frontal cross-hatched bodies, and animals, of which the sophisticated woolly sheep are the most noteworthy. The deer, in outline with a dotted body, may owe something to East Greek models. 30.8 has a much wider shoulder, and a Knossian parallel from Coldstream's deposit J.805 It is much closer to the straight-sided pithos, which had not entirely died out in the O period in fine ware (see 306.10) and perhaps served as a domestic article for longer. It has lines and bands on the body, and a very simple meander in red paint on the shoulder. (ii) Coarse EO: 28.1. This seems to be a coarse version of a shape related to class B (i) with ribbon handles. Its nearest parallel is perhaps to be found in the tubby pyxides of Arkades,806 but it is not too far from the household basin.807 C. PYXIS LIDS EO: 107.95, 104.30, 292.12, 292.156. LO: 126.12. Pyxis lids show as much variation as their larger counterparts. The earliest, 107.95, appears to relate to the small group from F. tomb P, especially F. no. 1405, conical with a concave profile; 292.12 is probably another of the same type. 104.30 belongs to the straight-sided pyxis 104.40, related to the Bird Group,808 and has a tall biconical knob not unlike those of some EG straight-sided pithoi such as F. no. 697, though more refined in shape. 292.156 has a stemmed knob like the lids of class (i) above but has a scale-pattern to match its pyxis. 126.12, the only LO lid in this class, is flat with a disc knob on a short concave stem, and appears to have been designed to drop on to a pyxis with a flange to hold it in place.809 Animal Vases a. bird askoi EO: 283.36, 283.37, 14.4.

The incised breast feathers of 129.3, to° fragmentary to reconstruct, suggest an LO date. B. ANIMAL ARYBALLOI LO: 34-26 (owl), 40.7 (monkey), 40.9 (cock), 65.8 (lion?). Owl aryballoi are well known in Crete;812 they show the eared owl otus scops, native to Crete. Several were found at Arkades, and a closely related hawk-like one in the Gypsades tomb.813 Ours is closest in style to the double owl vase in the Ashmolean Museum, certainly made at Knossos in a workshop close to the Fortetsa Painter.814 Ours is perhaps, like the Oxford vase, from the hand of the painter of the squat jug 13.5. Related, though probably not by the same hand, is the cock- vase 40.9. This large aryballos appears to be unique, and is perhaps a development of the bird-askos idea, under the influence of Corinth, as the incised details suggest. Monkey vases are well known in Fortetsa and elsewhere,815 though usually more like a vase than a monkey in shape, and much more crudely modelled. 40,7 is in general character related to the monkey vases, but the face is more like a human grotesque, perhaps apotropaic, and is dressed and entwined by two snakes, which may have a funerary significance. Its workmanship, like that of the other members of this group, is finer than that of its parallels. 65.8 is a fragment of the breast of an animal-vase. The shape suggests a lion; the dots may be seen as Corinthianizing (cf. the hare-vase 107,47), but perhaps a more useful comparison is with the lion vase from Arkades.816 C. PLASTIC VASE LO: 294.7. This unique vase combines a complex version of the bird askos, with a handle from head to centre back, and modelled wings and tail, with the Creto-cypriot bull's head at the front, and a Daedalic head instead of the cylindrical mouth or bird's head usual in a bird-vase. The head817 has arms connecting it with the bull, and is to be understood as riding it; H. W. Catling's suggestion818 that it may particularly represent Europa is one possible explanation, but it may be a piece of purely Cretan fantasy after Cypriot models, like the hippalektryon with a rider, Q,H5* 81° F. no. 354 (PGB).

This was one of the group of vases inside the big EO pithos 107.29. It is an extremely delicate example of the type, but like all plastic vases of its kind, extremely difficult to date.819 It cannot be later than about 680. Kraters and Dinoi KRATERS LO: 98,17. O kraters are represented here by the single example, 98.17, evidently once a fairly elaborate vessel, with a straight profile and spool-shaped lug handles. It may have been like contemporary lekanides. DINOI LO: 56*l85 56-25&gt; 56*4°&gt; *9±**5* The dinos is not well represented in Knossian tombs (perhaps because kraters were used more for libations than as urns: see p. 368, nn. 270-71), although it appears in domestic contexts as a variety of krater.820 It is interesting to note, therefore, that all but one of those in the N Cemetery belong to the LO complex 34/56/57, which also contained the outsize Wild Goat example 34.18. All of them have the incurving shoulder and flat rim noted in domestic contexts. 56.18, with its applied arabesques, large daisies, guilloche, and calligraphic loops, is perhaps the earliest of the local products, and rivals the import in size. The relief decoration is very close to that of relief-pithoi.821 56.40 is by comparison modest, and rather more sophisticated in decoration. Its chequer-board echoes that of the very much more complex example 294.15, decorated in part with animals very reminiscent of East Greek painting, with outline faces and solid bodies with reserved details; the hare between the dogs is dotted, rather like a two-dimensional version of a Corinthian hare aryballos (cf. 107.47). The leaping dolphins which complete the frieze have both reserved and incised details. The decoration is in general East Greek in flavour, but the fabric and the mixture of style suggests local manufacture. IMPORT, EAST GREEK Wild goat dinos: 34.18. This is an exceptionally large and complex dinos, though not by as refined a painter as the Wild Goat oinochoe 56.11. It had protomes, probably griffins, now missing, in imitation of metal cauldrons of a similar shape.822 The animal and ornament repertoire is the usual one, with floral complexes in the top frieze and small birds perching on some of the rosettes. It dates from about 630. 819 Cf. Maximova, Vases Plastiques, 109 with n. 3 and pl. 40. Necrocorinthia 176-7; Délos XVII, 90 and pl. 58E. 820 BSA 68 (1973) 42, no. 20. 821 E.g.

The guilloche below the ridge matches that on the dinos.823 Lekanides and Basins The lekanis has hitherto been known as an almost exclusively domestic shape at Knossos, and indeed most of the O examples in the N Cemetery are plain, though not necessarily coarse. The domestic article began to be painted in LO,824 perhaps with increasing prosperity. Here the finely decorated ones are EO. EO: 19*28, 14.20, 229.4, 75.208. LO: 107.18, 294.22, 60.35. None of the O lekanides has a projecting rim. The EO ones have straight or slightly convex sides, and a rounded rim which projects slightly inwards.825 Handles vary: they may be three-cornered lugs (75.208), reflex ribbons (60.35), cylindrical or straps. 229.4s26 has narrow grooves just below the rim, 75.208 and 60.35 have a single broad thumb-groove with the handle rooted in it. 19.28 and 14.20 are the only ones with any complexity of decoration. Both are clearly meant to be hung up in the same way as domed lids; their most striking decoration is on the underside, though neither of them is very elaborately painted, unlike those of Arkades,827 some of which were used as lids in the same way as kalathoi at Knossos had been until the end of EG. The zigzag and circles of 19.28 and the leaf-cross and hooks of 14.20 suggest an EO date. No decoration of any interest survives on the other lekanides: 294.22 bears a simple zigzag. The rest are plain and unpainted or coated in dark paint, possibly to receive white decoration which has not survived. The plain ones are probably straightforward domestic utensils. 60.35, ^ latest, anticipates the archaic variety.828 BASIN LO: I57«1* This coarse basin is extremely difficult to date: its tomb was heavily plundered. It has straight sides with four shallow grooves and a rounded rim. Its best parallel, BSA 73 (1978) 56, no. 48, suggests LO. Again, it is a domestic utensil pressed into service for the grave. Kalathoi O kalathoi are not as common at Knossos as their predecessors, as they ceased to do duty as lids for pithoi at the end of EG, and exist as bowls in all but a few cases; it is perhaps not surprising they often closely resemble lekanides. 823 Cf.

Trays Like lekanides, trays are normally relatively uncommon in funerary contexts at Knossos. They appear in domestic contexts, usually either with handles rising vertically from the rim (218. 138)831 or handleless (40.28, 287.3o)832 with a flat out-turned rim. Most of those below fall into one of these classes. EO: 76.5, 218.138.

It has no rising wall, only a slight ridge at the edge, and reflex handles; its big concentric circles on both sides make it a bold and distinctive piece. All the other trays are extremely fragmentary; the earliest LO examples have simple designs based on circles, and the pair from tomb 14 add thick, crude leaves. 65.9 has true LO decoration of volutes, and 59.6, the latest, has incised outlines to its lozenges and running dog. It was found with the LPC aryballos 59.1, and no doubt Corinth influenced the painter in his use of incision. Skyphoi A.

The black cup and the kotyle were evidently more popular by the mid-seventh century.

Almost none of this class of skyphoi835 has elaborate patterns, even if they sport more than reserved lines. The shape- change is the same as above, from deep and globular, to shallow, to deep and ovoid, with an intermediate stage between MO and LO where the lip is tall and offset at a sharp angle from a wide, deep, high-shouldered bowl. There is an example of a slightly unusual shape in 218.68, which seems to be from EO from its context, perhaps later rather than earlier, where the lip is short but vertical, and the bowl comparatively shallow. 292.218, a light-ground skyphos belonging to the middle of the series, has a row of metopes with wheels, zigzags and rosettes, a simpler version of what appears in contemporary polychrome pithoi, rather than on other skyphoi. C. HIGH-FOOTED MO: 107.85. This single example of a footed skyphos has the wider shallower bowl and sharply offset lip which suggests that it belongs in MO. Its decoration relates it to contemporary kotylai with long central panels and side-metopes. Its decoration is more complex than that of any of the other kotylai in our tombs mixing both dark on light and added white; all its patterns are rectilinear, and they differ from one side of the bowl to the other.836 D.

The Bird Bowl 57.1 belongs to the stage of development after the loss of the dotted line under the metopes; the lower half of the bowl is glazed with a reserved stripe. The tail of the bird is formed by producing the lower line of the body. The bird panel is much wider than the metopes at the sides.

This is a phiale of Price's style A,842 with geese between the handles and eyes under them. The bowl is very shallow with a straight profile to the underside.

KOTYLAI Most of these fall into categories which are already well-known,843 the shallow hemispherical shape which imitates the earlier PC prototype, and the deeper one which follows its successor. The majority of O kotylai in our tombs appear in LO contexts, even those which adhere closely to the Corinthian model, which it is interesting to note that most of them do. A.

The later pair from T. 56 are more elaborate: 56.23 introduces the double axe found in Corinth from LG onwards, but rare in Crete. 56.9 has a different pattern in the handle-zone on either side, and has the rays which appear on some EPC kotylai.845 There are no kotylai with truly LO patterns like those from Ay.

C. PROTO-KOTYLAI (i) Inward slope EO: 218.12. MO: 285.62, 285.63. These are examples of a kotyle shape which bears a strong likeness to a much earlier Corinthian shape which appears as early as MG II.849 The EO 218.12 is half-way towards being a skyphos, with a taller, wider rim. The panel of triangles suggests an early date in EO, as do its ribbon handles. If the two from T. 285 really were associated, as they seem to have been, with the pithos 41, they are a very late appearance of this shape. 285.63 has the nicked rim of the earliest Corinthian kotylai, 62 has the grouped strokes on the rim itself. Both have a reserved dot on the floor. (ii) Deeply nicked rim EO: 107.146, 283.62, 123.2, 123.7, 219.4, 219.5, 292.6. All these have a crude hemispherical bowl and a broad groove or nick below the rim. Decoration is never elaborate: 107.146 and 283.62 have grouped circles in a reserved band between the handles, which suggests an EO date. 123.7 has large double circles between strokes. The two dipped kotylai from T. 219 continue a traditional method of coating the lips of less important drinking vessels.850 292.6 begins to look more like a Corinthian kotyle of the shallow type with a nicked rim, and is probably the latest of the group - a more refined shape than the others. D.

The black cups perhaps need little special comment: they belong, with very minor variations (the reserved dots on the floors of 40.41, 107.49, 107.70, 285.112, and the reserved lines on the rim and handle of some of these), to classes already well-defined in F.852 and elsewhere.853 The sheer number of them allows us to see the shape change from the wide deep EO bowl with a narrow rim (78.7) to an intermediate stage with a rim of medium height (107.66) which becomes slightly concave in its later stage (45.8), finally becoming the LO version of which there are several in tomb 34: a tall, deep bowl, with a wide sharply offset lip. 285.21 and 285.32 are a variant which has the broad lip but wide shallow body.854 B.

WITH THE RIM HIGHER THAN THE BOWL EO: 19*8, 292.223. LO: 292.219. 19.8 and 292.219 both belong to a class of cup represented by F. no. 1004, with a tall lip, sloping inwards slightly with a carination at the join with the considerably shallower bowl. 19.8 was apparently plain though coated inside and out like a black cup. 292.219 is light-ground, and decorated very delicately with LO ornament in the manner of the Fortetsa Painter,858 though probably not by him. The fabric is thicker than is usual with black cups, in both cases, and the mouldings at the top and bottom of the lip of 292.219 bold. 292.223 is related to 19.8, but has an everted lip and pointed tripod feet, as if in imitation of a cooking pot.859 The white on dark decoration of crossed zigzags, leaves and verticals suggests an EO date and a relationship with the Bird Group.860 D.

The high foot is perhaps a later development of the shape with the ring foot (126.6, 34*11, 34.30, 34.31), all of which have a dark lower body, parallel with contemporary class D aryballoi. 34.7, 34*19» and 56.19 are all more delicately painted, with fine tongues on the conical foot. 34*19 and 56.19, both of which use birds and rosettes, are probably by the same hand. The double axe of 34.19 is probably borrowed from Corinth, and also appears on the local Corinthianizing kotyle 56.23. All the cups of this class are finer than their equivalents in F.,861 and seem slightly later. E. STRAIGHT-SIDED EO: 106.18. This is the single O example of this shape in our tombs, paralleled almost exactly for shape by an LG example, F. no. 1057.

These are all later versions of Brock's mug oinochoe.862 All of them have thick fabric, and the pair from T. 292 were never painted. 107.15 is a little later, with traces of bars on the handle, and a metopal scheme of decoration on its shoulders. G. MISCELLANEOUS EO: 292.17. This is a hemispherical single-handled cup. The fabric bears no resemblance to any other of our vases: it has a highly-polished yellow surface, and is perhaps of the same fabric as that of the conical cups published in BSA 67 (1972) 87, nos. 20-22, which Coldstream thought was probably local, and possibly imitating gold. LO: 34*2, 82.11. These two cups are both shapes which appeared as Bronze Age gold vessels, a low single- handled dish, and a trumpet-shaped mug. They appear to have been painted by the same hand, close to the Fortetsa Painter, and both of them have rather coarser equivalents at Arkades.863 34.2 also has a counterpart in F. no. 1175, probably by the same hand. H. IMPORTS: LACONIAN 34-36- The fabric of this trumpet-shaped mug is very like that of the Laconian black glaze discussed by Hayes in Tocra I, 87 ff. Its shape is not unlike that Laconian I cup illustrated at Artemis Orthia 108, 1. I suggest that it is late seventh-century Laconian black glaze, another of the considerable number of imports in this LO complex of tombs, 34, 56 and 57. Larnax LO: 56.15. The small polychrome larnax 56.15 is a curious phenomenon. LM III larnakes do appear in our tombs (pp. 000-0), and the LO niche of tomb 294, containing the Siren jug 294.7, was dug through one, so that the type was perhaps not unfamiliar to the late seventh-century Knossians. Ours is much smaller than LM III larnakes, and its lid is flat, not gabled.864 It does, however, have the inset panel on all sides which is a feature of earlier larnakes.865 The other notable feature of our larnax is the string loop and holes for securing the lid on the front long side, which are occasionally a feature of earlier larnakes,866 but also of the house-model from the Teke tholos,867 and so evidently a traditional part of the construction of pottery boxes with lids or doors. 862 F. 155, class II B. 863 See Arkades fig. 282 for the trumpet shape; figs. 273, 278 for the dish.

In the hands of some potters the fabric is capable of eggshell thinness, especially noticeable in the work of the Fortetsa Painter,868 (19.11, 292.37) and in the series of black cups and in imitations of Corinthian kotylai (56.9). It will also take a fairly high polish, often in imitations of other fabrics - some Creto-cypriot aryballoi (218.86) are a very close imitation of the red surface of the Cypriot prototype. The highly polished yellow cup 292.17, probably in the fabric reported by Coldstream in use for conical cups, perhaps imitating gold,869 appears to be in a related clay. Decorative techniques follow already well-established lines: exuberant and often amusing pattern-work, only occasionally refined, as in the work of the Fortetsa Painter (19.11, 126.7) and sometimes ambitious but ill-organised (13.5). A number of domed lids are decorated with fugitive white paint on a surface entirely coated with black, and the use of this technique may occasionally continue beyond EO - the lid with a handle in the shape of a Daedalic head 107.27 is a fine LO version of a very common shape. The most refined white-on-dark decoration, other than on these lids, appears on dark Praisos lekythoi (75.209, 292.33) and the straight-sided pyxides (104.20, 104.40) all related to the Bird Group.870 White decoration is more often simple - the lines and circles on the skyphoi of class A or as the enhancement of patterns on pithoi, or to supply circles on the bands of their lower halves. None of these uses is peculiar to the N Cemetery, and although commoner in EO, they are found in LO too (107.112). Brock noted the practice of dipping, though on earlier pots, as a method of coating the lips of less important pieces,871 especially drinking vessels. Our tombs have both dipped kotylai (219.4 and 5) and dipped oinochoai which seem to be O. 292.39 has the dipped patches where a Creto-cypriot oinochoe would have side-circles. The occasional bucchero item is already known in the Knossos area,872 and in the N Cemetery, as elsewhere, is normally used in the seventh century for aryballoi (107.21 and 22, 40.10), but also for the interesting small pyxis 107.78. These all have incised or impressed patterns, and the clay is dense, uniformly grey, and burnished to a smooth semi-matt surface. Coarse vessels are comparatively rare in the O period. Generally the fabric is porous and pink, often micaceous, with a grey core (60.6), reinforced with pebbly grit. Occasionally there is a cream slip (40.46), perhaps a version ofthat used for some fine wares. Occasionally, as in the case of the tray 30.3, the clay is brown, with a crumbly, biscuit-like texture, rather more like some polychrome pithoi. Polychrome pithoi of several varieties occur in our tombs. The clay used is generally like that used for fine vessels in the normal technique, and is fairly dense, hard and smooth. In general the smoother the fabric, the more fugitive the decoration: 75.14, which has a highly refined clay, has lost its polychrome completely. 285.41, rather grittier, has retained its paint ses BSA 55 (1961) 78 ff. 869 BSA 67 (1072) 87. a7« GGP 246 fr. 871 F. 187 and BSA 68 (1973) pl. 20. 872 Cf.

Very occasional variants occur: 107.28, an extremely large, and in the event, very fragile pithos, has a coarser fabric with widely-scattered grey-white grits, capable of being potted thinly, but not of supporting its own weight as well as smaller pots in denser clay. 34.59 and some other pithoi too fragmentary to catalogue, have an absorbent grainy surface, and their painted decoration is faintly blurred, as if painted on blotting paper. The colours used are the range already known: a blue which may become grey/black (75.7) and red on a creamy-white ground, occasionally with yellow ochre as a third colour for patterns (14.14, 82. i).873 Blue and white alone, unknown elsewhere, appears on 75.222, where the decoration suggests an early experiment, and blue and yellow alone on 107.57, probably rather later, suggesting that experiment continued beyond the earliest stages. CHRONOLOGY The chronological suggestions offered in the analysis above for the O pottery are disappointingly almost entirely relative; the number of imports is comparatively small, and there is only one firm association of an imported pot with a local one, the PC hare aryballos 107.47 with the EO pithos 107.29, and it belongs to a class which is itself notoriously difficult to date. There are, however, a few points which it is worth making about some classes of pot and some tombs. A. POLYCHROME PITHOI T. 285, a tomb which had a notable absence of imports in the O period, had a virtually undisturbed series of polychrome pithoi with their associated smaller vessels. Polychrome pithoi have always proved to be extremely intractable chronologically, but ours, both from T. 285 and other tombs, correspond generally to the pattern observed by Brock and Payne.874 Very large pithoi with unusual feet (e.g. 107.28) and unstable fabric are on the whole early, as are complicated patterns which relate closely to pithoi in the normal technique with elaborate handle panels (e.g. 75.221). Polychromes of more moderate size, with a mixture of continuous pattern bands and alternating void and filled patterns belong in the middle of the series; the mixture of void and filled panels is the later feature. The patterns themselves are more complex earlier, and the taste for elaborate birds is not pursued in the very latest members of the series, which generally show much simpler patterns such as continuous chequer-board and rays at the base (57.10). These latest traits appear on a series of smallish pithoi with smooth fabric and a high wide shoulder with a sharp taper to the foot (75.10, 75.20). The pithoi of T. 285, then, belong in the middle of the series: 285.33, 36, 40 and 41 have complex bird life and an even distribution of red and blue, but no really complex patterns. 40 has the alternate void and filled panels forming one band, and both this pithos and 41 have the continuous chequer- board. All four of these and 24 and 27 have an elongated oval shape and are of moderate size. 24 just begins to show signs of the high wide shoulders displayed by 285.12 and 13 which should be the latest polychrome pithoi in the tomb. It therefore seemed reasonable to call 33, 36, 40 and 41 MO, as they do suggest a transitional stage in the middle of the series. 873 E 188, BSA 29 (1927-28) 281 f. 874 F. 188 f., BSA 29 (1927-28) 280 ff.</page><page sequence="179">462 ELIZABETH MOIGNARD B. ARYBALLOI It is also worth noting that none of the aryballoi associated with the T. 285 polychromes has the complex all-over patterns of class F, but belong to class D, with a dark lower body and a few fine lines edging the shoulder. It seems justifiable to regard at least some of these (285.54 and 55) as MO rather than LO, and to think of this class as earlier than classes E and F, though overlapping with them. c. black cups This class of cups is so numerous that although there are few definite associations there are gradual changes in shape which make it possible to suggest a MO period. The earliest members of the series, at least vaguely associated with other EO pots (106.8, 107.49), have the wide deep bowl and narrow rim close to their LG predecessors. Those classed here as MO have a shallower body and a more pronounced rim (107.66) and a wider shoulder. The LO version, like those in F, have a deeper, narrower body, and an even more pronounced rim (3410). D. DAEDALIC HEADS There are two items with Daedalic heads, the Siren jug 294.7 and the lid 107.27. The Siren jug clearly belongs with other complex LO vessels such as the standed oinochoe 126.7, and was found near the dolphin dinos 294.15, which appears on stylistic grounds to belong to the second half of the seventh century. The head itself belongs to a group dated between 650 and 620,875 as does that on 107.127, which has LO patterns on the lid. IMPORTS Seventh century imports in our tombs are extremely sporadic, and it is not possible to make more than a few general observations about them. The most common imported fabric is Corinthian, and the majority of the imported items are oinochoai and kotylai. There are two olpai and two aryballoi. Most oinochoai and kotylai are EPC; the latest items are one EC aryballos 106.40 and one EC oinochoe, 126.11. Most of the imported material was concentrated in the extremely disturbed LO complex of tombs 34, 56 and 57, in which the local material appears on stylistic grounds to range from standard LO items such as the high-footed cup 34.19, or the jugs 34.21-24 to very late pieces such as the pithoi 57.9 and 10, and the jug 57.5 which has a parallel for its pattern in a sixth century jug from Tocra.876 It is noticeable that in this group of tombs the Corinthian imports seem to cease with the LPC /Transitional olpai 34.1 and 56.2; the Chian phiale 56.21, of about 640, and the Wild Goat oinochoe 56.11 and dinos 34.18, of around 630 suggest a change of interest on the part of the owners of the tombs, or perhaps of sources of supply in the last third of the seventh century. 875 Jenkins, Daedalica pl. 6, with BSA 58 (1963), 1-7. 876 Tocra I, no. 921, pl. 55.</page><page sequence="180">THE ORIENTALIZING POTTERY 463 ILL. i.

Only one was found on the material from the N Cemetery, and they are equally sporadic elsewhere.877 Our text is well-cut and intriguing. The vehicle is a small LO bucchero aryballos of c. 650-625. The line of lettering is cut between mouldings on the shoulder; while the start is preserved, an uncertain, possibly substantial amount is lost at the end. In broad stylistic terms the text is reminiscent of seventh-century fragments from the Athenian Acropolis or of the painted texts on the portals of the house-model recently excavated on Thera, of approximately the same date.878 The transcription is clear, Jtepatac xaX(X)icrco jt[..., with punctuation of a normal Cretan type. The lettering is as we would expect of the period, with generally tall, slim forms. The join of lambda and iota seems almost deliberate, just hinting at the possibility that it was in use in brush-written inscriptions; the curvaceous iota may have had a similar origin. What may appear at first sight to be a banal owner's inscription becomes more perplexing at each review, and I will not offer any definite solution. Any sentiment commencing Jlépa T&amp;ç ytaXkÍGTOV Ji[e.g. JiaxQÓç is very heavy and one would have expected verse. JieQorcaç as a single word could admit of a large range of interpretations in Cretan, but none is attested as a personal name, as we might expect the word to be; neQ(XTT]Ç is perhaps more likely as a name than ITeiQ(XTT]Ç, while Oei(Q)a... can hardly be entertained. A name that is attested at Knossos, nriQavxac, may perhaps have been written in this assimilated form, and may be regarded as the most plausible interpretation.879 KoXkÍGTO would then be taken as a genitive, 877 One may cite a single graffito scrap from the Gypsades tomb, BSA 76 (1981) 151, fig. 5.

LlDDY883 Introduction884 It seemed natural that the Fitch Laboratory (FL) of the British School at Athens should be called in to help with the study of some of the pottery unearthed by the School in the Knossos N Cemetery. The Laboratory has facilities for chemical and pétrographie analysis of ceramic finds, and has accumulated over ten years of experience in the field. It is, therefore, in a privileged position to undertake a large project of analysis of material from Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. Some comparative material is available to the Laboratory in a large data bank of previous analyses, performed both in Athens and also by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art (RLAHA) in Oxford. For the Laboratory, the project has developed in three major sections. These 'divisions' in the project are apparent in the report. The first section concerned the investigation of the sources of the pottery found at Knossos N Cemetery. Approximately 140 samples were analysed. The second section involved the analysis of 100 samples from the Institute of Archaeology, London. These were from four sites in the Levant, and from unprovenanced Cypriot sources, comprising BoR, Bichrome, Red Slip, and White Painted wares. This 883 Editorial note by R. E. Jones. Dr Liddy's report was completed at the end of his tenure as Fitch Laboratory Fellow in 1986. He published summary and preliminary reports on the results in 1988 and 1989 respectively. With his agreement, REJ edited the main report in May 1995 and added some bibliographic references to relevant work published since 1986. Although programmes of chemical analysis of Greek Iron Age pottery have continued in the Fitch Laboratory and elsewhere in the years since Dr. Liddy's work, it has not been thought necessary to make any substantial changes to Dr. Liddy's interpretation of the chemical data of the material from KNC. On the other hand, as Dr. Liddy explains, a significant aim of this project was to investigate the sources of the Black-on-Red and Levantine imports at Knossos in particular, and their centres of production more generally. The reference material that he collected in Cyprus in 1985 had not been fully analysed before he left Athens the following year. It was not until 1991-2 that a subsequent Fitch Laboratory Fellow, Dr. N.J. Brodie, was able to complete the analyses. His work, (N. J. Brodie and L. Steel 'Cypriot Black-on-Red Ware: towards a classification', Archaeometry 38 (1996) 263-78), supersedes much of what appears here in Section 4b. For the rest, REJ acknowledges reference to some of the KNC data presented here in his work at Torone (Whitbread and Jones, forthcoming) and Chania. 884 Acknowledgments. The author would like to thank Dr. R. E. Jones for his constant help and guidance for the duration of the work reported here. The advice of Dr. H. W. Catling was much valued. The late Dr. V. J. Robinson and Dr. S. M. A. Hoffman were most generous with the time they spent on some initial cluster analyses. Professor J. N. Coldstream is thanked for his contribution of much of the archaeological interpretation included in the report. The Fitch Laboratory is grateful to the following for permission to sample pottery for comparison with the material from Knossos: Dr. V Karageorghis, Department of Antiquities, Cyprus, and Dr. A. Caubet, Department of Oriental Antiquities of the Louvre. Dr. P. J. Parr kindly arranged for the material in the London Institute of Archaeology's collection to be sampled. The cooperation of the RLAHA for the use of the Oxford University Computers was indispensable.</page><page sequence="183">466 D- J. LIDDY material was supplemented by approximately twenty samples from the Department of Oriental Antiquities in the Louvre in Paris, of sherds from various central Levantine sites. The initial aim was to use the information provided by these data to locate the origins of the supposed Levantine and Cypriot imports to Knossos. Ultimately, however, the data might lead to further understanding of the production centres of BoR ware in the region. The former aim is the concern of this report; the latter must await fuller publication. The third section of the project, barely started, concerns the investigation of the major Early Iron Age pottery production centres on Cyprus. Over three hundred samples of BoR, Bichrome, and White Painted wares have been collected from fifteen sites throughout the island. Approximately twenty sherds were selected from these, from four geographically dispersed centres, to attempt a preliminary investigation of the sources of the Cypriot material found at Knossos and the unprovenanced sherds of the Institute collection. All these groups of samples are listed in TABLE i. The Laboratory now uses Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for chemical analysis of pottery. Previously, the technique of Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) was used, and this project is the Laboratory's first to use the newer method on such a large scale. It has proved a very good test of the applicability of the technique to analysis of Greek pottery and should guide future Laboratory projects in what can be achieved, and what should perhaps be left to other laboratories using more powerful methods of analysis. The Laboratory also gains considerably from a large new set of data encompassing a wide range of sites, particularly from Cyprus and the Levant. Samples from the Institute's collection (TABLE ±b) were assigned to groups (R to Z) according to find-spot and class of pottery, not according to a style or fabric indicating that find-spot as a probable source. Thus many samples were given ratings of i (see p. 471). This is particularly true of samples forming the BoR groups, the sources of which are uncertain. Groups comprising other classes, Bichrome and White Painted wares, were selected as control material. All the classes are contemporary and, from the analytical standpoint, possess similarly fine-grained fabrics. Frequent reference will be made to R. E. Jones et al, Greek and Cypriot Pottery, a Review of Scientific Studies, hereafter GCP (1986), which is a comprehensive review of analytical projects in the region and sets out much of the Athens and Oxford Laboratories' previously unpublished data. This volume should be consulted especially to assess the use of these laboratories' data banks for particular regions of Greece. Methodology atomic absorption spectroscopy All the samples were analysed at the FL. The analytical procedure followed well established and tested methods using AAS. For a comprehensive description of the technique and its theory see Price 1979. Otherwise, Hughes et al 1976 outlined the application of the method to pottery provenance studies. The latter work formed the basis of the procedure used by several laboratories, including the FL, and others such as the RLAHA and the National Archaeological Museum's Chemical Laboratory in Athens. The method is economical and reliable where sophisticated technical back-up may not be readily available. The results it gives are not as accurate as its main competitor in the field, Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), and in addition, it does not normally provide analyses of as many elements. But it is on a par with the latest X-Ray Fluorescence analyses (XRF), and is superior, in both these respects, to the now obsolete method of OES.</page><page sequence="184">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY Afa Table i .

Dependent upon the size of the clippings, powdered clay was then obtained either by drilling with a small tungsten-carbide tipped drill, or by crushing in an agate pestle and mortar. Whole pots were sampled directly with a drill to obtain sufficient clay powder. In all cases, care was taken to avoid inclusion of weathered or surface material. Sufficient powder</page><page sequence="185">468 D. J. LIDDY was collected to allow for repeat analyses and a minimum of ioo mg was deemed necessary in each case. All powders were dried at 200o C for three hours prior to accurate weighing for sample preparation. AAS requires that the sample for analysis is in solution. This was achieved by using the lithium metaborate fusion method (outlined by Hughes et al 1976). For each sample, an excess of lithium metaborate (LiBO2) is added to a fixed quantity of the clay powder. The mixture is then fused at high temperature (approximately 900o C) to form a borosilicate glass which dissolves readily in dilute nitric acid. The avoidance of contamination is of utmost importance during all stages of the procedure. The lithium metaborate used was a SPECPURE reagent manufactured for the purpose, and fusion was performed in a platinum crucible. ANALAR nitric acid and deionised water were used throughout. TABLE 2 summarises the procedure used. The spectrometer was calibrated for each element using two concurrent methods: with a series of multi-element standard ('potmix') solutions made from SPECPURE nitrates and chlorides, and with solutions, made exactly as above, of six standard clays. The 'potmix' recipes (based upon those used by the RLAHA (Hatcher et al 1980), but since modified (Liddy 1989)), were designed to incorporate the full range of element concentrations found in the clays under analysis. The six standard clays, though for some elements not providing such a good calibration line, ensured a consistent, reproducible calibration. Usually, the two calibration lines were in satisfactory agreements but, always, the standard-clay line ('guided', if necessary, by the 'Potmix' one) was used in the final calculations of element concentration from the absorption readings obtained. Each batch of analyses, normally comprising 32 samples, included two blank solutions, made in the above manner but excluding a clay sample. This ensured that sample contamination, from the reagents and preparation procedure, was constantly reviewed. All but two elements were measured using atomic absorption) concentrations of Na and K were more reliable (in the sense of producing straighter and more closely matching calibration curves) using atomic emission. TABLE 3 summarises the elements measured and associated experimental conditions. As a routine, at least one sample was analysed twice in each batch, mainly to ensure that any calibration drift of the spectrometer was satisfactorily small during each batch, and to check upon the reproducibility of the analyses and sample preparation. Other samples were reanalysed in different batches to ensure inter-batch comparability. Insufficient samples were analysed to provide an estimate of the precision of the analytical procedure used. The reader's attention is drawn to the repeat analyses in TABLE 5 (at the end of the chapter) for an indication of the reproducibility of the results produced by the procedure outlined here. Table 2.

Ideally, each group should contain samples from one source, different from samples in another group, which would be from another source. In practice, it is sometimes seen that one source of pottery produces more than one chemically distinct group of samples. Alternatively, two or more sources may produce pottery of similar (and dependent upon the analytical and statistical techniques used, sometimes indistinguishable) composition. The real difficulty, therefore, is to decide which, and how many groups in the data are archaeologically significant. A glance at TABLE 5 reveals the large quantity of data that must be interpreted in the final phase of any reasonably sized pottery provenance project. The sheer quantity and complexity of the data ensure that a simple visual or 'manual' examination would fail to produce the required reliable information for the archaeologist. Admittedly, such a visual examination is useful but is only part of the data interpretation. In this situation recourse is generally made to multivariate statistical techniques, of which cluster analysis is widely applicable.886 It does not 886 The procedure followed is similar to that outlined in Liddy (1985). Neither Discriminant Analysis, which was inappropriate for the task in hand because of the unknown structure of the data, nor Principal Component Analysis, because of the complexity of the data, were used here. Both these methods are undoubtedly useful in many instances, and their application is discussed by Pollard (1986, 56-83).</page><page sequence="187">470 D- J- LIDDY provide a definite answer but merely illustrates the structure of the data. It is up to the analyst and archaeologist to discover what this structure means. Sometimes this is easy because groups are well separated; at other times, when clusters overlap, for example, it is more difficult. Ward's method of cluster analysis was selected for classifying the data (Pollard 1986, 72-3). This calculates the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between each sample in one cluster and each sample in the neighbouring clusters. In other words, it is looking for the clusters that have the smallest overall variance, or greatest compactness. The next cluster to be formed at each stage of the procedure is that which will result in the smallest increase in that sum of squared distances. It will search for the most compact groups, and is quite 'resistant' to the addition of individual samples outside established compact groups. The method works well, and is more 'sensitive' than the Group Average method, but the two produce results in general agreement. The two also suffer the same drawback: once a sample has been annexed by a cluster it is fixed there, no matter how much that cluster changes shape or 'position' as it grows. Samples can easily end up in the wrong cluster or, at least, be better placed in another cluster. The Relocation Procedure (RELOC in the CLUSTAN package, Wishart 1982) can be set to run like Ward's Method with the important difference that at each stage it will check that each sample is in the best cluster, and if it is not, will relocate it. RELOC is arguably the best method of cluster analysis of the multivariate numerical data encountered in a chemical analysis provenance study. Unfortunately, it is difficult to represent the results diagrammatically, because of all the switching of samples, and so is best used to refine the results of, for example, Ward's Method and produce a final listing of samples to clusters. It helps also in deciding which structure is (or how many clusters are) significant. An indication of a good set of clusters is one which is formed at a relatively low dissimilarity coefficient, but in which one cluster is merged with another, or has further samples added to it, only at a much larger dissimilarity value. The switching of numerous samples at the latter stage adds further confidence that the structure at the previous stage is worthy of consideration. For this project, cluster analysis was performed on all samples for the following elements: Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, Mn, Cr, Ni, and K. Ti and Si were excluded because of missing data. Data were standardised, but not log-transformed, for the final analysis. Comparison of cluster analysis on log-transformed and raw data in this project proved that the effects of the latter were minimal (GCP 68). Two issues to consider now are outliers and data sets with non-normal multi-modal sample distribution. Outliers, which have very high or low concentrations of a particular element or elements, are single samples on the edge of an element distribution. They distort the arrangement of the majority of samples on that axis when the data set is standardised. The mean and standard deviation must always be the same, and so when an outlier is present in the data set, the bulk of the samples are crushed together. When the outlier is removed, the remaining samples are spread out into a more nearly normal distribution, and cluster analysis stands a better chance of distinguishing different groups of samples. Samples with unusually high or low values of any element should be treated carefully. The simplest solution is to remove them as soon as they have been identified. Outlier clusters must also be identified and then removed before the remainder of the data-set is examined. A useful approach to identify potentially detrimental departures from normality in a data- set is to examine the overall sample distributions for each element. This can often reveal any outliers, but in addition discloses any bimodal sample distributions, i.e. those that contain two bunches of samples rather than an even array. A bimodal distribution means that cluster analysis places greater importance on the separation of the two clumps than any structure</page><page sequence="188">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 4^ within them. It is advisable, to ascertain this structure in a reliable fashion, that the two halves of the distribution are separated and then re-examined. It is for these reasons that the visual examination of the data at all stages of the procedures, particularly at the beginning, using univariate and bivariate plots, is of such importance. The results of a cluster analysis are depicted diagrammatically in the form of a dendrogram. The dendrogram shows how similar individual samples, arranged vertically down the left-hand side, are to each other. The more similar two samples are, the nearer to the zero they are linked on the dissimilarity scale which is across the top. As more samples are joined together, clusters are seen as distinct branches in the dendrogram. The Samples and Results of Analysis JNC has outlined below the criteria that guided the selection of the samples from an archaeological point of view. Groups of samples were selected according to supposed or likely origin on the basis of their style and fabric. To help the Laboratory in its assessment and interpretation of the analytical data, an indication of the confidence with which this supposed origin was based was provided before the programme of analysis began. The confidence (or probability) rating was established on a 1-5 scale (see TABLE 40). A rating of 5 indicates that the sample is almost certainly from the centre named in the group; a good example here was the local control, Group A, with thirty samples which, according to style and fabric, were in all likelihood made at Knossos or in its vicinity. Occasionally, adequate numbers of samples of a particular type were not available to make stylistic groups of a size completely satisfactory to the Laboratory, an example being Group E. The other end of the scale, 1, signifies that it is most unlikely that the named centre was the source of the samples in question. an archaeological note byj. N. Coldstream Most of the sampled vessels are from the N Cemetery, but pieces from settlement deposits (areas of Royal Road, Unexplored Mansion, etc.) were included to make up groups of five or ten for some of the rarer imported fabrics. The thirty vessels under Group A were chosen to represent Knossian fine painted ware, exclusive of special categories obviously imitating imported fabrics (Groups B, N) and other visually different wares also presumed to be local (Group O). Samples were chosen to cover the full chronological range of the N Cemetery, and to represent every size of vessel from thick-walled cremation pithoi to small thin-walled aryballoi. Group B was drawn from the numerous imitations of Attic Geometric, mainly MG, and close in shape and decoration - and even in technique - to Attic prototypes. The clay is usually fired to a pinkish brown colour recalling Attic, but one misses the high lustre normal for Attic; the clay is less compact, and the surface often comes out matt and mottled. It was originally thought possible that B 32 and B 40 might be Attic, for some Attic MG originals may also lack lustre, whether through imperfect firing or through Cretan soil conditions. The twenty samples of Group C were selected to cover the ftill chronological range of Attic imports in the N Cemetery from the tenth century down to the late eighth. These vessels all share the usual orange-buff clay of Attic PG and G, carefully levigated, and often fired to a high lustre. Inclusions which remain consist of small chestnut-brown particles and small grains of mica; the more highly micaceous pieces in an Attic style were assigned to one or other of the Cycladic groups G-J. Since Attic PG and G pottery is usually unslipped, some reservation was felt over the inclusion of the slipped amphora C 48.</page><page sequence="189">472 D- J- LIDDY Of the five vessels in Group D all but one share the finely levigated yellow clay of Corinth and can be closely matched with Corinthian counterparts from PG to O. The exception, D 62, is of a darker buff tone; it was included to discover whether it is an atypical Corinthian original or a close copy, of the well-known Aetos 666 type of kotyle. Group E is a miscellaneous lot. The fragmentary krater E 67 corresponds closely to Argive LG in style and fabric, especially with the pottery of Asine. For E 66 and E 68 an Argive origin was thought possible, largely on grounds of shape. The group of five was made up with unique pieces, in the absence of any other vessels of Argive character. The amphora E 69 corresponds to Thessalian material from Marmariani in fabric, and in the distinctive diagonal cross on the neck; the wheel design of E 70, together with its purplish-red fabric with thick cream slip, recalls the SubG amphorae of Thera. The imports presumed to be from Euboea on stylistic grounds make up Group E The clay is usually reddish brown, darker than Attic, free of mica, and fired hard. The chronological range is from PG (F 71, F 76) to SubG (F 75); this last vessel has the thick cream slip typical of much Euboean pottery from LG onwards. Some reservations were felt about the large krater frs. F 80; the step meander is of Argive origin, the ships recall the Attic Dipylon Workshop, but the clay looks Euboean rather than Attic, and the Geometric decoration falls far short of the precision of original Attic work at this time. The small groups G, H, and J were tentatively ascribed to Melos, Naxos and Paros, settlement sherds being included in each case to make up a set of five. Least homogeneous in fabric was the supposed Melian Group G, the clay varying from dark red (G 84) to a tone resembling Attic, but with more mica than was thought usual in that quarter (G 81, G 82, G 85). The amphora G 81, though of Attic type, has a close parallel in the Melos Museum (Kunze, JOAI 39 (1952) 54 ff. figs. 1-3). Less uncertainty was felt about the Naxian Group H, distinguished by a highly micaceous red-brown clay, H 87 being of a slightly lighter tone than the other four pieces. Among the Parian group J 91, J 94 and J 95 conform to the clearly defined Parian LG style, and share the sandy orange micaceous fabric characteristic of Paros. The Atticizing MG skyphoi J 92 and J 93 were thought to contain too much mica for Attic originals. Even more heterogeneous is Group K, attributed to the various centres of the East Greek world. Earliest is the krater K 96, paralleled in East Greek PG both in shape and decoration; the highly micaceous brown clay seems at home in Miletus. At the other end of the chronological scale, the bird bowl K 102 and the Wild Goat dinos K 104 conform to well- known East Greek O types; also the white-slipped O phiale K 99, characteristic of Chios, and the Archaic aryballos fr. K 105. The animal style of the O oinochoe O 103, and its grey-brown slipped surface, suggested an East Greek origin. The frs. K 98 and K 101 are from closed vessels with rectilinear decoration on the shoulder, an East Greek G feature; both being misfired, their fabric offers no help. K 97 was tentatively included here for its ridged neck; likewise the highly micaceous K 100, an imitation of Cypriot Bichrome Red, recalled finds in the cemeteries of Kos. Group L consists mainly of Cypriot BoR lekythoi (or juglets) of a standard type. The clay is fine orange-brown with an often shiny red slip, and matt black decoration (the finer and paler clay of L 114 was on second thoughts considered a local imitation; RDAC 1984, 129 no. 30). The fr. L no is from the same shape but in Cypriot Bichrome. The oinochoe L 112 corresponds in fabric to the main body of BoR lekythoi. The small Group M was made up from supposed Levantine imports, among which the Bichrome lekythos M 116, the Red Slip lekythos M 117 and the metallic-looking Red Slip</page><page sequence="190">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 47g oinochoe M 120 are standard types in the Phoenician repertoire. Their fabric is heavier, and of a deeper red than in Group L - criteria which inclined us to the inclusion here of the BoR lekythos M 118. The five vessels of Group N are indebted in various ways to the imported Cypriot BoR lekythoi, whether in shape and decoration (N 121, N 122) or in the shiny orange surface (N 125). In general the clay is harder and paler than that of the Cypriot originals; the walls are thicker, and there is no slip. N 123, apparently from a small pyxis, is included here for its large sets of circles on the flanks, in the Cypriot manner. Group O is composed of two less usual fabrics, both presumed to be local. The bucchero technique enjoyed a passing fashion in the MG (O 126, O 127) and EO (O 128) phases; the pithos-urn and its lid exactly copy the shape of painted MG examples. Unpainted aryballoi in pale orange or buff clay occur from EG to EO; some examples, as O 129, are handmade, but most are wheel-made (O 130). Finally Group P represents the gritty brick-red coarse ware of the Knossian kitchen (P 134, P 135), used also for the miniature copy of a bronze tripod cauldron (P 132) and the small ribbed oinochoai modelled after a Cypriot prototype (P 131). The mica content varies considerably, becoming greatly reduced from LG onwards (e.g. P 134). The strange pyxis P 133, containing large white inclusions as well as mica, appears to have been influenced by an antique Early Minoan prototype with lug handles. J.N.C. TABLE 5 presents the analytical data. Samples are listed by Laboratory number. The element compositions are shown as a percentage of the element oxide. Missing data are indicated by -. Repeat analyses of individual samples are listed together. The data represent the results of ten batches of analyses performed over a period of eighteen months. The samples analysed are listed in TABLE 'a-d. This records each sample by its appropriate stylistic group, Laboratory number, and excavation or catalogue number. Also tabulated is the probability (see p. 000). To aid the reader in following the discussion, and to provide easy reference, the final conclusions drawn from the data analysis are also represented: the cluster number (labelled 'ILL. Number/Cluster Number', e.g. Cluster 2/1 = ILL. 2, Cluster 1), to which each sample belongs, and a probable or suggested source for that sample on the basis of the chemical analysis. Samples without entries in the 'cluster5 column are unassigned to groups. This normally means that they were oddments. If sensible, an entry is made indicating a sample to be 'most similar to' (#) a particular cluster or sample. Entries in the 'probable origin' column should be used warily, and only in conjunction with the discussion of each of the clusters. For the Levantine and Cypriot samples, discussed in section IVb, the entry is much more speculative than for the Aegean material. For some clusters, it was unwise to suggest a possible source. Discussion The results of the data are presented in several ways. Discussion of clusters refers to those obtained by RELOC. Table 6 (end of chapter) lists the membership of all the clusters in turn, and TABLE 7 (end of chapter) gives the group chemical compositions for each of those clusters, in terms of the mean and standard deviation for each element. Also indicated is the probable source of each set of samples, summarising the conclusions drawn. The data-set incorporating all analyses was examined first. Several outliers and oddments were identified at this stage and then removed (TABLE 8, end of chapter).</page><page sequence="191">474 D- J- LIDDY Four outliers were from Group P. Though Pi 32 and Pi 34 were somewhat similar to each other, the variation in chemical composition amongst the five samples of that group, supposedly from one source, was very large. This is most readily attributed to the coarse, gritty nature of the fabric, and it is probable that the variations are due to the difficulties in sampling rather than an inherent variability in the compositions. Apart from P131, discussed below, none of the samples from this group matches with anything else. The closest remaining correspondences are of, in fact, P132 and P134 with the Cypriot samples of Group L, but the similarities are not sufficient to suggest that this is a possible source. Archaeologically, such a hypothesis would seem to be untenable, since the local attribution was largely based on the large quantity of this comparatively crude ware found at Knossos. It must be debatable whether this factor alone is sufficient grounds for the assignment of pottery to a particular source. IA18 is one sample with an extremely high Cr content. (The sample solution was noticeably green.) The sample was reanalysed, with good agreement for all elements. Unusually high Cr values have been observed for Cypriot samples by Bieber (1978). For one sample, with a concentration of 0.58%, he suggested an origin in the Troodos Mountain region, which has ultrabasic rock formations characterised by extremely high Cr values (see also GCP 342, footnote, which mentions particularly erratic Cr measurements for clays from this region). On this basis, a Cypriot origin can be suggested, but it is a unique sample in this project, and little more can be said. Also removed at the beginning were LV10, LV15, and LV21. There is considerable chemical variation in the LV group of samples, as discussed below, and these three are the most extreme. The sample distribution for each element was then examined. It was apparent that there was a bimodal distribution for several elements, particularly Cr and Ni. The bimodal distribution was the result of a marked dissimilarity between the Aegean material on the one hand, and the Cypriot and Levantine material on the other. It was desirable, therefore, that these groups were separated, taking care that samples 'in the middle' were placed in the correct half. In such cases, ambiguous samples, such as many from Group K of supposed East Greek origin, were at first placed in both halves of the data-set and examined to see with which they were most similar. The separate files were obtained using cluster analysis (Ward's Method and RELOC). The two sections, being the final two clusters given by this analysis, are discussed separately. AEGEAN MATERIAL The Aegean section of the data resolved into nine clusters, some of which were distinct and easily determined, and others which were less so. The data set was subdivided for final evaluation, and these sections are illustrated in ILLS. 2-4. These dendrograms do not show some samples that were considered to be on the outer edge of any clusters. Though not outliers as such, they have been left unclassified because of the uncertainties involved with oddments. A 'most similar to' statement, if sensible, is assigned to such samples in TABLE 4. III. 2 shows the last section of the Aegean material to be resolved. It contains the majority of the samples of presumed local origin, from Groups A, B, N, and O. Three samples, A23, N124, and K99, were always separate throughout the stages of cluster analysis, and could be deemed a distinct cluster, 2/2. The remaining samples could not, however, be reliably subdivided, despite the apparent substructure in the dendrogram: significantly different groupings were obtained using Ward's Method and RELOC, and with slightly different file</page><page sequence="192">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 475 Increasing Dissimilarity A1 I A 1 N125 I N - I A5 I A -1 /V/22 I N -H-, AU I A -i_T , A25 I A 1 AW I A ■ A2 I A -1 .

With RELOC, for example, there were only gradual increases in dissimilarity coefficient as clusters were merged to form the one final group, and for many samples it was difficult to decide to which of the sub-clusters they more correctly belonged. There was considerable switching of samples. It seems wise, therefore, to classify them as a single group, Cluster 2/1. This can sensibly be interpreted as the major local group, and such an interpretation provides few surprises. The composition (TABLE 7) matches reasonably well with previous FL analyses. Differences in composition between 2/1 and 2/2 are minor (Cluster 2/2 has slightly higher Ca and Na, slightly lower Cr and K contents), and both could be seen as variations on a Knossian or central Cretan composition. Previous analyses in the FL of Knossian Minoan and Classical to Hellenistic pottery are shown in TABLE 9. Agreement between the sets of data is imperfect owing primarily to the use of different techniques (for the comparability between OES and AAS data see Jones and Vagnetti 1991, 129-31), but also perhaps to the chronological spread represented among the Knossos samples. Nevertheless, all sets have the characteristic high values for Cr and Ni. The major discrepancy between 'old' and 'new' data is in Mg. III. 3 shows the next section of the data. Cluster 3/3 is distinct from the others, but its constituent samples again suggest a Knossian origin. The group composition bears this out (TABLE 7), with differences from either 2/1 or 2/2 manifested only in slightly higher Ca and K, and slightly lower Al, Cr, and Mg contents. The vessels of 3/3 are slightly lighter in colour, reflecting perhaps the greater proportion of Ca. The dendrogram shows that sample A20 is not quite in this cluster, but the attribution to Cluster 3/3 is quite definite in RELOC. Only one sample from Group A is excluded from one or other of these clusters: A28 is an oddment. The sherd was brittle, the fabric coarse with numerous inclusions, and different from others of Group A. Its different chemistry (lower concentrations of almost every element compared to the samples of Cluster 2/1) comes as little surprise in the light of this. A29 was not analysed. Of the samples of Group B, B40 was the only sample found to have a non-local origin. All samples of Group N, supposed local imitations of BoR ware, were confirmed as such. Three of five samples of Group O, supposed local but of unusual fabric, were similarly confirmed (the other two, O129 and O13O, are in Cluster 3/6). Clusters 3/4 and 3/5 are distinct from all other groups, but quite similar to each other. RELOC produces two quite definite clusters, but these do not agree exactly with those obtained by Ward's Method. This discrepancy means that the allocation of certain samples should be treated cautiously. Theoretically, it is probable that there are two similar clusters in the data space, with some uncertainty over whether samples in the middle go with one or the other. In other words, there is some overlap between the two. The somewhat uncertain samples are B40, C41, C42, C52, C53, C55, C60, andjg2, if this is based upon discrepancies between different cluster procedures. Mn, K, and Cr are amongst the few elements that do discriminate (TABLE 7). Cluster 3/4 contains, almost exclusively, samples of typical Attic fabric, labelled C. The exception is J93, a supposed Parian import (with, however, some uncertainty regarding such an attribution). Cluster 3/5, in contrast, contains samples of a wide range of fabrics, and incorporates many samples of supposed origin elsewhere. B40 was described as 'possibly Attic', and this, assuming that 3/4 and 3/5 are Attic clusters, is confirmed. F74 and F79 are noticeably different, chemically, from the majority of Group E Three of the five supposed Melian samples are here (both the others are in 2/1, the Knossian group); there is no</page><page sequence="194">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 477 Increasing Dissimilarity I A15 3 A-i E68 3 E -' B36 3 B-j ' 1 0128 3 O - ' Knossos C A24- 3 A-i A2U 3 AJ ' 0/2Í 3 O 1 A20 3 A i CU 4 C -i__ 1 a? 4 c-HJ VÄ? 5 J - ' BW 5 B-i C4? 4 C-H- _. a/ 4 c-iTI C52 5 C-1^ h «2 4 C 1 «7 4 Ci ae 4 cm r53 5 C -i 1 Attic A C55 5 Cf 1 C60 5 C-1 «5 4 C-i at 4 c^U 7«? 4 JJ 1 CU6 4 C-iJ C54 4 C-r^ «5 5 C-i 1 F79 5 Fih F79 5 F-nl JÔ/ 5 GJ -.

There is also one sample each from Groups H, J, and K. Yet the cluster is not chemically more variable or diffuse than its more obviously homogeneous neighbour, and so it can be stated with some confidence that 3/5 is a single cluster containing samples from one production centre or region. It is unlikely, for instance, that the procedure has failed to separate Attic and Melian sources.</page><page sequence="195">478 D- J. LIDDY All but two samples of supposed Attic fabric are present in one or other of the clusters. C57 is distinct and is included in Cluster 4/7. C58 is a little unusual, because of high Ca and low Cr, which leads the cluster analysis to throw it out. Nevertheless, it is more similar to the Attic groups than anything else. It is interesting to compare the ages of the samples in the two groups. Those in Cluster 3/4 are predominantly dated to the tenth and ninth centuries (PG to MG); those in Cluster 3/5 to the eighth century (MG to LG). The feature is less consistent for the sherds of supposed non- Attic fabrics, such as G81 and G82, but nevertheless, it is still evident. Fillières et ai (1983), working at Brookhaven with NAA, have found similar, though better defined, distinction within Attic ceramic material from the Agora at Athens. Their groups separate chronologically: PG, SubG and Classical/Hellenistic. Direct comparison of the data is risky because of the different methods used and different laboratory standards. In TABLE 10 are listed group compositions for their Attic B (PG) and C (SubG) groups, for those elements measured in this study. Most of the elements discriminate between the groups to some degree, though Cr is probably the most significant. There is not a good match with either Cluster 3/4 or 3/5 in this instance; for neither project is Ca a major discriminant between the different groups. Cluster 3/6 is a small, compact, distinct group of five samples: three of five samples of Group D, supposedly from Corinth (one other is in Cluster 2/1, the remainder is an unassigned oddment), and the two of five supposed local sherds with unusual fabric. 0 129 and 0 1 30 are both yellow aryballoi. The former is hand-made, with good parallels in the cemeteries of Corinth; the latter is wheel-made, and more of a surprise since no known wheel- made examples are known in Corinth, though many are at Knossos. Comparison with previous Laboratory data for Corinthian pottery in TABLE 9 shows a similarity consistent with an origin in the same region. This is supported by comparison with the Corinthian group obtained by Fillières et ai, shown in TABLE 10. The remaining section of the Aegean data, shown in ILL. 4, resolves into three clusters. 4/7 is a compact group containing the majority of the supposed Euboean imports. F74 and F79 are the only two missing; both are assigned to the Attic Group 3/5. In this case, previous FL AAS data are available for pendent semicircle skyphoi from Lefkandi, and the match is very good (TABLE 9). The match is equally good with Euboean data obtained by the RLAHA (Popham et ai 1983), the group composition of which is shown in TABLE 10. Two samples were common to this project and that undertaken by the RLAHA. This presents the opportunity to see if results obtained by the laboratories are comparable over a period of several years. F76 corresponds to the RLAHA 12.038, and F71 to 12.039. Disturbing discrepancies do exist, which is somewhat surprising considering the close correspondence with the group compositions, but this can only confirm that group compositions are much more reliable, and therefore informative, than single analyses.887 Cluster 4/8 contains four of the five supposed Naxian imports (the other was assigned to 3/5). The match with FL OES data of Orientalizing Naxian pottery (TABLE 9) is reassuring, and differs markedly only for Ca and Mn. P131 is the only sample from Group P to show any 887 It is not clear from the publication what 'normalisation' procedures were used to produce the reported data.

Here it is an outlier of the cluster: the match is good for Al, Ca, Fe, and K, but poor for Mn, Cr, and Ni. This suggests that Pi 31 does not come from the same source as the Cluster 4/8, but could be taken to indicate a Cycladic, if not Naxian origin. There is certainly no match with any of the Knossian clusters (2/1, 2/2, and 3/3) and, geologically, the gritty red micaceous clay characteristic of this class of pottery is lacking in the region of central Crete around Knossos (P. M. Day, pers. comm.). Such clays are, however, present on Naxos and perhaps other Cycladic islands. Again, it should be stressed that little more can be said, since it is notoriously unreliable to base too much on the results of a single analysis. A pétrographie examination of these and further samples of the class would certainly provide greater insight and probably prove more effective considering the analytical difficulties posed by the material. Cluster 4/9 presents a problem. It contains samples whose presence together is difficult to reconcile archaeologically, or in terms of the sample fabrics. It is, nevertheless, a reasonably compact group, characterised by high Al and K and low Mg. There is, however, more variation in a few elements than might be expected for a single group. This is particularly noticeable for Mn, and Ca and K to a lesser extent. There are two alternative conclusions to draw in such a situation. Either the samples of 4/9 are from two or more sources which produced pottery of similar composition, or the group is valid and represents a single source, in which case the archaeological aspects have to reappraised. It is, of course, easy to dismiss any 'archaeologically unreasonable' finding with the former notion, but such a finding should not be readily dismissed: rather it should encourage further investigation.</page><page sequence="197">48o D. J- LIDDY If it is assumed that the group is valid, it is desirable to try to locate its source. Obvious contenders are the Argolid and Paros, the former because of the presence of the typically Argive E67, and the latter because of the three samples of Group J. Comparative data for these two regions is available from the databank, and is shown in TABLE 9: a LH III group of pottery from Mycenae analysed by AAS, and a small group of OES analyses of Archaic material attributed to Paros. Differences between the two groups are irritatingly small if they are to suggest one source or the other for 4/9. There are good matches for some elements with both groups, but neither is good enough overall to enable a satisfactory conclusion to be drawn. On a positive note, the two composition groups in TABLE 9 are significantly different, and so it would be expected that pottery from the two sources could be distinguished chemically. It is the function of cluster analysis to search for groups in the data. Thus, if the samples of Cluster 4/9 are more similar to each other than any others, they will appear together in a group. Only if there are significantly more samples in this section of the data space will it be possible to decide whether there is meaningful substructure hiding two or more groups of samples from subtly different sources. More samples of similar types, typically Argive, and typically Parian, must be analysed before the problem is resolved. In the meantime it can be said that: E67 is sufficiently similar to the Mycenaean comparanda in TABLE 9 for it to be consistent with an Argive origin. But it is not as good a match as might be hoped (cf. Ca and Mn). E69 has lower Mn and higher Cr and K than E67. Stylistically, the only comparanda for this unique piece are from Marmariani in Thessaly. The composition group for the latter is shown in TABLE 9. It is, unfortunately, old OES data and so should be taken only as an approximate guide. It is not a good match. J91 is slightly different from J94 and J95, which are very similar to each other. Similarity is such that it is reasonable to predict that all three are from the same source. The comparative data can, at most, allow it to be said that a Parian origin is not unlikely. Kioo is somewhat different from the rest. There is no good match with any of the Argive, Parian, or East Greek comparanda in TABLE 9 (see discussion of the samples in Group K below). There are several other surprises in the data. The first is the lack of an obvious Melian group. Although only five 'supposed Melian' samples were analysed, two (G83 and G84) have been assigned a local (Knossian) origin, and three (G81, G82, and G85) an Attic one, and these are good matches between respective samples and clusters for all elements. There seems to be no doubt here. The samples were certainly distinct from other Melian Geometric sherds (and fifth-century plaques) analysed at the FL and RLAHA, as shown in TABLE 9. The differences in Ca, Mg, Fe are very large. The second unexpected finding is the large proportion of supposed East Greek samples, labelled K, that have been assigned to non-East Greek clusters. A single K Group should not have been expected. The term 'East Greek' encompasses a plethora of possible production centres and, presumably, composition groups. Only a few of them have been characterised chemically (see GCP 662-71). Ten samples, in such a situation, are inadequate for the task in hand. The chemical variation within the samples is enormous, for example, Mg ranging between 1% and 10%, Cr between 0.02 and 0.1%, and K between 1% and nearly 4%, signifying that there are many different production centres to be resolved. Of the ten samples, three are unassigned, and seven others assigned to five clusters (2/1, 3/5, 4/7, 4/8, and 4/9). This means that it is difficult to be certain about these assignments, again because single samples are often involved. The findings must not be dismissed, but investigated further with many more samples.</page><page sequence="198">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 481 The complexity of the situation warrants that the samples are discussed in more detail. All comparative material is taken from TABLE 9. K96 Unassigned to any cluster. The micaceous brown fabric suggests that Miletus may be a possible source. The match with the OES Miletus group is good for all elements except Ca and Gr. The sample is less similar to the other East Greek groups. An origin in Miletus is certainly consistent with available evidence. K97 This sample has been assigned to two clusters: 3/5 (Attic B) and 8/3. The composition is so close to the group composition for 3/5 that it is difficult to see how this cannot be a reliable assignment. But the difficulties involved with any statistical analysis of single samples are adequately illustrated by its incorporation in Cluster 8/3, with which it is much less similar. There is no similarity to the East Greek comparanda. K98 Excellent match of all the elements with the local group composition 2/1. The closest of the comparanda is the Rhodian group, which has similarly high Mg and Fe, but any similarity or possible confusion is refuted by the differences in Gr and Ni. K99 Again, a local assignment, but with Cluster 2/2. It would be unwise to be definite about this, since the cluster itself contains only three samples, but the match is good for the data available. Kioo Good match with Cluster 4/9 for all elements except Mn (but see discussion of this cluster above). Of the East Greek comparanda, it is the most similar to Miletus, but it is not a good match. K101 Assigned to local Group 2/1. Similar to K98 in all but Cr. K102 Matches well with the Euboean Cluster 3/7. Nothing else has the unusual combination of very high Al and low Mg. A fairly definite assignment with the present data. K103 Assigned to Cluster 4/8, which is Naxian. There is a good match with this except for Mn. K104 Unassigned. The only other possibility would be with the Miletus group, but it is not a good match: Ca, Na, and Ni show notable differences. K105 Assigned to Cluster 3/7, along with K102. There are some differences between these two samples, but the Euboean source still seems most probable. LEVANTINE AND CYPRIOT MATERIALS (see editorial note, p. 465 n. 883). The Levantine and Cypriot data set was divided into two parts, each subsequently subdivided to produce the final data sets illustrated in ILL. 5-8. III. 5 shows samples resolving into three or four clusters. All are presumably Cypriot. Cluster 5/1, reasonably distinct, includes all five examples of BoR ware so far analysed from Kouklia in SW Cyprus (CY2-CY17). The cluster includes three of the imports found at Knossos (L106, Li 13, and L115), and six of the ten examples of BoR ware found at Al Mina (Group 5). In fact, all samples but IA40 and CY107 are BoR ware. The presence of LV14 in this cluster is most probably a coincidental association, since it is unlikely that this MBA pot from North Syria could be an export from SW Cyprus. It is a single sample and far removed chronologically, both factors which could be a possible cause of confusion. In contrast to the samples from Kouklia, the six so far analysed from Kition failed to form one group. CY98 and CY99 are distinguished from the others by low Ca and Mg, and form a small cluster, 5/2. The remaining four split into four separate clusters, and the variation within them indicates that more than one source is represented (the samples labelled CY are discussed further below). Clusters 5/3 and 5/4 are not definitely resolved. No samples are present to suggest a source, but it is a tentative confirmation of Cyprus as the producer of samples L110, Lin, and L112. All the sherds (except L110) are BoR. Ward's Method places M117 in cluster 5/1, but RELOC places it in 5/3, which is the preferred allocation. Unfortunately, a specific origin cannot be offered at this stage, but the presence of Mi 17 here apparently refutes its supposed Levantine origin.</page><page sequence="199">482 D- J- LIDDY Increasing Dissimilarity I &gt; IA11 I S- L, CY7 I Ko- H , CY10 I Ko ' IA12 I S -L m* i Ko-n ' - | A42Ö I S - ' CY107 I Ki - i J i£ CY107 : I Ki 1 3-T - - i ' _, ¿W6 i L - ' M/4 I S -L IA17 I S A-, //M0 I U - ' - i Kouklia?

The data incorporated in ILL. 6 form several compact and distinct groups. Only for a couple of samples is there some doubt over assignment. It is possible to suggest origins for many of the clusters too, since they contain much of the control material for the Levantine sites. Thus, this section of the data contains all but one sample from Group X of Red Slip ware from Tell Farà, and all samples of Group V of Red Slip ware from Tell Ajjul. It is unfortunate that these clusters, for which it seems possible to suggest an origin, contain little but the appropriate control material. Cluster 6/1, containing problematic BoR pieces and L108, remains unknown, though a Cypriot origin is not inconsistent with the samples present. Clusters 6/3 and 6/8 are also presumably Cypriot, because they contain only supposed Cypriot pieces. However, they are not distinct groups, and all remaining samples in this data- set are apparently Levantine, so some caution should be expressed, and further work done, to establish the origins of these clusters.</page><page sequence="200">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 483 Increasing Dissimilarity IA16 I S -i ¿475 I Y-J IA77 I Y-" IA53 1 W-i ?

Dendrogram from cluster analysis (Ward's method) for Cypriot and Levantine material: sector showing Tell Ajjul, Tell Farà and Cypriot groupings. It is apparent once more that all the clusters comprise one class of pottery to the (almost total) exclusion of others. This, to some extent, undermines the idea of using one class of pottery (in this case Red Slip ware) to pin down the origin of another (the BoR). It seems evident also that either individual sources are producing pottery of more than one compositional group, or several sources are producing pottery of similar fabric which is in use</page><page sequence="201">484 D- J- LIDDY Increasing Dissimilarity fA' ! 5 3-1 Al Mina IA5 « R - ' .

It is difficult to generalise by suggesting which elements may be primarily responsible for this feature. Clusters 6/4 and 6/5 of Red Slip from Tell Ajjul are slightly different in many elements; Clusters 6/2 and 6/7 of Red Slip from Tell Farà are noticeably different in Ca and Mn. The remaining data form three major groups, two of which are, respectively, Clusters 7/1 to 7/3, and 7/4 to 7/7 in ill. 7. It is reasonable to suggest that these small clusters represent Phoenician sources. This is informative because it confirms the suspected sources for Mi 16, Mi 18 and M120 as Levantine but no more precisely than that. Mi 16 and Mi 18 are similar to each other, but form a little group on their own. Mi 20 is a singleton. The evidence is consistent with a Phoenician origin for the samples of Phoenician-style Red and Black Slip (IA91, IA94 and IA95), found on Cyprus, but nothing more specific can be proposed at this stage. The Red Slip ware from Al Mina separated into two very distinct clusters, 7/1 and 7/3. It is difficult to believe that they are from the same source, and in this case it is most probable that the products of two Red Slip centres were in use at Al Mina. It cannot be confirmed that Al Mina was the location of these sources. The Louvre samples, which were included as examples of pottery found in the Central Levant, are difficult to interpret or use as possible pointers to sources in this region. They form a disparate set, indicating that several sources, not necessarily in the same region, are represented. LV2, LV3, and LV4, all Bichrome from Bassa, are similar to each other, but are in Cluster 8/6 with supposed Cypriot material. Otherwise, the majority of the samples are dissimilar to material from other sites and form small distinct clusters, such as 7/5 and 7/7, or oddments.</page><page sequence="202">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 485 Increosing Dissimilarity IA3 I R 1 ' , IA88 I Z ' IA8 2 R - i IA13 2 S -1 U IA23 2 T-y IA23 2 T-f J 1 LV5 2 LV J M119 2 M ' ¿424 3 T - 1 M30 3 T -ih IA38 3 U -"^ ' K97 3 K ' ' IA19 4 S -1 IA89 4 Z -H. rr&lt;?/7 4 La- |_M ~ rK?22 4 La- ~ ' M2/ 2 T - i_J M22 2 T - ' /425 5 T -1 /.// 5 Lv - *n ¿459 5 W -i_J IA59 5 WJ ^3/ 6 U -1 rr/öf 6 Ki -1 M« 6 Z -1 . ¿V4 6 LV -H _, ¿1/2 6 LV -|T| ¿l/J 6 LV-Í IA97 6 Z -1 J MM 6 Z -J ' IV13 6 LV-1"^ IA34 6 U -1 /&gt;493 6 Z - H I , IA35 7 U - 1 M99 7 Z -iT CY105 4 Ki -T /¿2&lt;S 7 T 1 IA32 7 U - 1 , IA33 7 U -ih^ IA39 7 U -H-1 M3&lt;í 7 U - I 1 ' IA27 5 T -1 IA28 5 T -H .

The component clusters are set apart from all others in the Levantine and Cypriot section by higher Cr, in particular. Statistically, there are two structures that are more viable than any others: 8 clusters and 5. In RELOC, there is much switching of samples at almost every stage: it is not, unfortunately, an example of a data-set where the subdivision of a couple of the five clusters leads to eight clusters in total, because the membership of the eight clusters is often quite different. Neither structure is consistent in Ward's Method and RELOC, and the structure at eight clusters has been chosen because it causes the least apparent archaeological conflict. In effect, all clusters '8/-' should be treated cautiously. Theoretically, this could be a situation of overlapping clusters. Either the analytical technique has proved insufficiently sensitive to separate the products of different centres, or all samples in ILL. 8 were from pottery produced in a single region. A preliminary inspection reveals that there is no obvious correlation between the find spots of the remaining Cypriot samples labelled CY and their assignment to particular clusters. This is in contrast to Cluster 5/1, for example. To summarise the results of the analysis of the 21 samples labelled CY: Those from Kouklia, as already discussed, form a reasonably compact group (in Cluster 5/1), but with some variation in Al and Ca. They are all BoR ware. The six sherds from Kition are very varied, and probably from different centres. To complicate matters CY98 and CY99 (forming Cluster 5/2) are both BoR. CY102, CY105, and CY107 are Bichrome, and each quite chemically different. CY107 is superficially similar to the samples from Kouklia, and the slight discrepancies, such as slightly lower Mg and Mn, could be due to the difference in fabric. However, it has been placed in Cluster 5/1 with the Kouklia samples. CY109 is BoR, and most similar to CY221 from Lapithos. The four samples from Lapithos (CY217-CY222) are, if anything, more similar to each other than to any of the samples from Kouklia or Amathus, but would form a broad group because of variation in Al, Ca, Fe, and Mn. However, the cluster analysis shown in ILL. 8 splits them up on the basis of this variation. It is difficult to decide whether they are from one or a number of sources in a single region. CY217 and CY222 are both White Painted ware, together in Cluster 8/4; the others are Bichrome but of slightly different composition. Samples from Amathus (all BoR ware), CY192-CY197, which were not included in the cluster analysis, fall in two groups, one with high and the other with very low Ca. They are all otherwise similar. Superficially, CY182-CY187 are similar to CY98 and CY99, but can be distinguished from the latter by slightly lower Ca, Mn and K. They could be from the same region. CY196 and CY197 are most similar to the Kouklia group, but again are not identical to them. What is emerging generally from the work so far is that the compositions are a reflection of both find-spots and ware. More specifically concerning Al Mina, ILL. 8 includes all the White Painted ware of Group T and all but two of the Bichrome ware from this site, and yet this need not signify local production in view of the site's status as an emporium. A particular 'archaeologically unreasonable' cluster seems to be 8/6, which contains a mixture of supposedly Cypriot and Levantine samples. However, the best proposition, as the situation currently stands, is that all the samples in ILL. 8 are Cypriot. If this is the case, further analyses of the Cypriot control material would undoubtedly clarify the situation. An alternative, if less likely, suggestion, obviously, is that there is similarity between some Cypriot clays and those from across the sea in the region of Al Mina. Clusters 7/1 and 7/4 of Red Slip ware, possibly from Al Mina, are very different from any clusters in ILL. 7, particularly in Mg and Fe.</page><page sequence="204">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 487 Recourse to comparative data is not of much help. If that produced at Manchester by NAA for BoR ware from the Levant (Matthers et ai 1983) is examined (in TABLE 10) it is apparent that the differences between their Palestinian, Syrian, and Cypriot groups are quite subtle for the elements that are common to both techniques. Thus the high Fe for clusters 8/- may hold more similarity with a Cypriot origin. The high Cr values indicate neither. Bieber (1977) presented composition groups for Kition and Idalion (others seemed less certain in their assignment), neither of which seems to match with any of the groups here. The only material that seems to provide any handle with which to pin down the source of these samples is the group from Lapithos, which has the distinctive high Cr that also denotes Clusters 8/1 to 8/8, although the situation is complicated by the way the Lapithos examples divide through the clusters. An origin in northern Cyprus is consistent with the data. Conclusions The principal conclusions drawn from the analysis of the pottery from the Knossos N Cemetery are summarised in TABLE 11, which lists the initial fabric groups and shows how far the analytical work has confirmed or disputed the suppositions. The locally produced pottery at Knossos was correctly identified in nearly all cases, including the imitation of BoR ware and of imports from Attica. The analysis has revealed some segregation of the local material, but no support for this group has been found on stylistic grounds, except that one group has a slightly lighter-coloured fabric. It seems unlikely that the presumed-local gritty red micaceous wares were made at Knossos; they are chemically quite different from the Knossian groups in this project and other Laboratory Knossian compositions of Classical/Hellenistic and Minoan pottery. In addition, there is no known source of such clay in the region. This result indicates how unreliable it may be to assume a local source simply because of the large quantity of a type of pottery at a particular site. Though, at this stage it would be unwise to suggest that Naxos was the origin (since such an assumption would be based upon an imperfect match of one sample with the Naxian Group) such an hypothesis is geologically plausible. Pétrographie examination of examples of the pottery will hopefully throw more light on the matter. A chronological variation in composition seems to exist in the imports from Attica, amongst which two groups were identified: the group containing predominantly PG pottery had a slightly different composition from that containing mainly LG pieces. The latter group comprised a greater range of pottery fabrics than would have been expected for Attic imports. This was reflected in the large number of member samples originally attributed to other sources. The most notable example of this was the supposed Melian pottery found at Knossos, much of which was included in this Attic group. There seems to be little doubt about this result since other Melian G pottery previously analysed by the Laboratory is quite different in composition (TABLE 9). No Melian group was identified amongst the pottery analysed. As far as the Corinthian, Euboean, and Naxian imports are concerned, they were, on the whole, correctly identified. Pottery of East Greek styles was coming from different, chemically diverse, sources. The number of samples analysed was insufficient to characterise or identify the suspected production centres in the eastern Aegean. More surprising was the apparent result that so many of these pieces seem to have come from much further west: several individual sherds clustered with Knossian, Attic, Euboean, and Naxian groups. It would be unwise to be definite about this conclusion with the evidence as it stands, since many single samples were</page><page sequence="205">488 D- J. LIDDY involved, but it should not be dismissed without thorough investigation of both archaeological and scientific aspects simply because it is 'archaeologically inconceivable'. The examples of the supposed Melian and red micaceous pottery are situations where the scientific evidence can lead the archaeologist to an alternative, but quite plausible, approach to the material. It is conceivable that the two examples with a Knossian composition are local imitations, but for the remainder of the East Greek pottery, it has to be admitted, the findings are as yet irreconcilable with archaeological evidence. There is also some uncertainty concerning the sources of the Levantine imports. The results suggest that three of the five samples were indeed Levantine, probably from two sources. Unfortunately, there was no direct match between the imports and any of the control material from the sites of Al Mina, Tell Ajjul, Tell Farà or elsewhere, although this does not in itself, of course, exclude these sites as possible sources. One sample was Cypriot, and the origin of the other was uncertain. It is safe to say that the imports of BoR ware from Cyprus were confirmed as such, with the exception of one which turned out to be a local (Knossian) imitation. They were of varied composition and so apparently from different centres. Since the unprovenanced Cypriot control material proved to be inadequate, BoR and other decorated wares found at the major Iron Age sites have been collected and are being analysed. So far, a single composition group comprising examples of BoR ware found at Knossos, Kouklia, and Al Mina in the Levant, is perhaps the most interesting result. Even if this does not necessarily imply that Kouklia was the source of this pottery, though that is quite possible, it can be said that one production centre was responsible for the pottery in use at each of these sites, and that centre is, most probably, Cypriot. There are several important, more general points raised by the project which are worth re- emphasising. The main problem, common enough in provenance investigations, was the lack of sufficient samples among some of the classes of pottery analysed, with the result that the characterisation of their sources lacked precision. The Laboratory was aware of this difficulty, but the dilemma was a result of the very aim of the project: to locate the sources of the pottery found at the Knossos N Cemetery. The interpretation of the analytical data proved complex. The principal difficulty was only too obvious, there being many single samples with uncertain assignments. Cluster analysis is not well suited to treating such samples reliably. This exception apart, however, careful observation of data set structure, particularly for outliers and departure from normality, ensured that the majority of the clusters found were robust in the terms of their sample membership. Most of the Aegean centres were found to have produced pottery identifiably of distinct composition. The main exception was observed with the differentiation of supposed Argive and Parian material. In this case, the problem was compounded by insufficient samples, since previous work has indicated that pottery from the two areas should be capable of differentiation. The primary problem areas were those with insufficiently reliable control material, without which the project could not have been expected to resolve the questions posed. What it has achieved, particularly with the East Greek pieces, is to show that, given the correct control material, great progress could be made, since the level of inter-site variability in composition within most regions was found to be adequate. The instances of Knossian and Attic material resolving into multiple composition groups are of interest, although their archaeological significance is not fully apparent. Three explanations for this phenomenon, in which Ca seems to be influential, but not alone, come readily to mind: the exploitation of several clay beds, wide natural variations in clay</page><page sequence="206">A CHEMICAL STUDY OF DECORATED IRON AGE POTTERY 489 compositions, and the effect of different potters' practices in preparing the clay. But in the case of the Attic material, a more specific hypothesis can be formulated to explain the existence of two chemical groups, one (Cluster 3/4) belonging mainly to the tenth-ninth centuries BC, the other (Cluster 3/5), more varied in fabric, to the eighth century BC. Either this represents a single production centre exploiting different clays over time, or there is a spatial explanation, the early group being Athens itself, the later one perhaps representing one or more workshops in Attica. AAS has proved adequate for the task in hand, with few exceptions. It seems that it is sufficiently sensitive to pursue the investigation of the Cypriot material, though this should be monitored frequently. If the data resolves into region-specific groups, it might be worth delegating analyses to NAA laboratories to see if this is a feature of the Cypriot clays themselves, or simply due to the use of an insufficiently sensitive technique. The comparison of the project data with analyses in previous projects at the Laboratory has proved quite useful in several cases. Unfortunately, data generated by AAS is in a minority; most of the databank comprises OES analyses which are best employed as a guide to which groups may prove useful as comparative material. If a match looks promising, ideally the samples should be reanalysed. This reaffirms that a reasonable quantity of samples should always be available for further analysis, which in turn draws attention to a long-standing drawback of the chemical approach to pottery analysis. As analytical techniques develop and improve, old data become less reliable and useful as comparanda. Such a situation is in marked contrast to pétrographie work, in which the original thin section can, as new needs arise, be re-examined. The comparability of AAS results, within the FL and, generally with those of the RLAHA (where the same standard clays are currently used) is, however, good and should be adequate without reanalysis. This is valid as long as the same standardisation procedures are maintained. The present project confirms the wisdom of any attempt to persuade different laboratories to use identical clay standards (see now Jones 1994). In conclusion, this project has achieved most of its original aims, but at the same time, it has raised several issues in terms of approach to composition and provenance work, as well as exposing lacunae in the 'map' of characterised production sources in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. In the Aegean the most pressing needs for further work lie in the Islands and East Greece. The project has highlighted some of the problems in identifying the origins of the well- known classes of Iron Age decorated pottery so commonly found in Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Hopefully, the work now in progress will at least partially resolve these problems. TABLE 40. Pottery samples from the Knossos N Cemetery and results of analysis Sample no. Catalogue no.

W. Catling Introduction Of the nineteen tombs for which there is evidence of one kind or another that they were in use, or were first used, in Subminoan, three (Ts. 186, 200, 201) are conspicuous for the quality and interest of objects other than pottery. T. 121 also contained a small number of non- ceramic objects. There is much variety in the materials represented - gold, bronze, iron, glass, glass-paste and/or faience, ivory, bone, boar's tusk. Several of these objects are likely to have been exotic, and emphasise the remarkable character of one or two of the individuals who were the first, or among the first, to be buried in the new cemetery. For this reason, these classes of material are not subsumed among the general studies of the material in use throughout the history of the Dark Age and Orientalizing cemetery, but are given separate consideration in the section that follows. The Bronze Stand, 201. fl (figs. 165-6; plate 276) I have elsewhere890 tried to place the object of which the eighty-five fragments recovered once formed part within its wider context. The original four-sided stand was decorated with figure- work in ajouré panels, probably in two registers. It stood on legs, as Nicosia L.308, London 1897/4-1/1296, London 1920/12-20/1, Jerusalem (Megiddo 1342); not on wheels, as Berlin 8947, London 1946/10-17/1, Nicosia 1978/XÌ-21/1 and others. It is so damaged that the reconstruction proposed in FIG. 166 must be regarded as tentative. The combined evidence of the fragments demonstrates, however, that there were human figures, monsters, animals and birds in the design (a combination which, for instance, has already been seen in London 1946/ 10-17/ 1). Two registers of ajouré figured ornament are to be seen on the same London stand just mentioned and on the fragmentary Borowski stand.891 Nicosia 1978/XÌ-21/1 has three registers; here the scale of the figures is the same in each register. I have argued that the wider class of stands to which the four-sided stands belong was the product of Cyprus. I have suggested that more than one workshop was involved, in view of marked differences in style to be seen among stands decorated with figure-work. I have also claimed that there is very strong evidence to show that at least one of those workshops was located at Enkomi; the telling evidence is the stone mould published by J.-C. Courtois and J. 890 RDAC 1984, 69-91, especially 86-87 and pl.15. ™l u. Acnuies in U. W. Muscarella (ed.), Ladders to Heaven: Art Treasures fiom Lands of the Bible (Toronto, 1 981), 254-260, no. 223.

If this is so, then Hala Sultan Tekke should be the site of another workshop, in view of the similar mould published by D. Bailey893 among the finds of the 1897 Turner Trust Excavation for the British Museum, the true significance of which was seen by Karageorghis. I have also tried to sustain an argument that limits production of the stands to the later 13th and earlier 12th centuries BC, or to the later part of LC II C and to LC III A. By extension I have proposed that the numerous stands and fragments which have been found outside Cyprus, notably in Crete, the Islands, Greece and as far West as Sardinia894 in substantially later contexts should be regarded as antique heirlooms some of which (e.g. Athens 7940, found in a Geometric grave on the Pnyx) must already have been four hundred years old at the time of burial. Almost as an a priori proposition, I took the view that the very considerable metallurgical skills possessed by the stand-makers in their Cypriot workshops did not survive the turmoil of twelfth-century Cyprus, and that it was of so very specialised a character that it was unrepeatable. This view was not simply capricious. I was much influenced by the fact (which has never been seriously contested) that all the technical and design elements which are to be found in the corpus of the stands had already been developed by LC III A, attested by the stands and fragments from reliable contexts, of which the Myrtou-Pigadhes group895 is the most important. As new discoveries are added to the corpus of stands, and as the character and implications of the class are more widely scrutinized, my view of the evidence has been questioned, in a number of ways. A recently published paper by E. Macnamara and N. Meeks896 suggests that I have over-estimated the extent to which the complex stands were brazed together from separately made components, and that there was, consequently, a wider use of cire perdue than I had supposed. My views on the relatively short life of the workshops responsible for making the stands, and their exclusive location in Cyprus have been questioned particularly by H. Matthäus,897 who argues, inter alia, for a local, eighth-century BC production in Greece to account for the fragmentary stands from Delphi, and in Crete from the Idaean Cave, Kato Syme Viannou and Knossos, Khaniale Teke. This is not the right vehicle for a re-examination of the problem, which calls for extended treatment, and the full publication of material from Greek excavations which is so far known only from brief preliminary statements. But I have no doubt at all that the stand from T. 201, burnt on the pyre with its owner r.1050 BC, had been made in Cyprus at least one hundred years earlier, and that it stands close to London 1920/ 1 2-30/1 (the 'Ingot-Bearer' stand), said to be from Kourion. The Bronze Sword, 201. f7 (fig. 163; plate 277) The sword was found broken in four pieces; this apparent ritual 'killing' might have been partly dictated by the need to fit a large object into the small tomb chamber. The typology 892 'A steatite relief mould from Enkomi', RDAC 1979, l'i 1-8, with pl. 1 q. 893 HSTl, 11 and pl.7 = London 1898/12-1/213.

Mediterranean weapons were made locally. Not the least persuasive element in this analysis must be the discovery of four Type II swords of very similar design among a hoard of bronzes (the 'Sword-Founder's Hoard5) at Enkomi.901 This is not the place for a fresh general analysis of the material, but note should be taken that approximately a dozen complete or fragmentary swords have been reported from Crete. Our sword is the first of this type from Knossos or its vicinity; other firm provenances include Mouliana (four examples, two each in Tombs A and B), Myrsine, Aspropilia (district of Siteia) and Karphi (a fragment). Less reliable are weapons from 'Vrokastro',902 Siteia,903 'Siteia',904 and Mesara.905 My original classification divided these swords into Groups I-IV, of which Group I is the earliest, and indisputably purely European in design, even if most of the examples found in the Aegean and beyond were, like the blades in the Enkomi 'Sword-Founder's Hoard', made in the Mediterranean area and not in Europe. The Myrsine weapon and one of the Mouliana Tomb B pair belong to my Group I.906 No Group II swords have been identified in Crete.907 Group III (which I compared with J. D. Cowen's 'Letten' type,908) is best represented in Crete; two of the Mouliana swords are of this type909 as also is the 'Mesara' weapon and the Oxford weapon from 'Siteia'. The Mouliana material is to be dated late in the thirteenth or early in the twelfth century BC. At first glance our T. 201 sword should be classed with these Group III weapons. But it differs in two important respects. The hilt plates were secured by only three rivets, where Group III swords regularly have five and seven rivets for the purpose. Second, in the place of the parallel grooves which set off the centre-line of the blade ('blood-channels'), in Group III, there are pairs of fine parallel relief ridges. Also, the profile of the handguard of Group III swords is straight, where ours is noticeably curved. My Group IV weapons included the numerous blades which stood apart from Groups I- III in being relatively small, with vestigial pommel ears. Bouzek included this material in his 'Series C: Catling IV which he subdivided into 'IVa, (Type Hama): 'IVb' (of which the 898 The very extensive literature concerning Type II swords, particularly their occurrences in Greek lands (to which I have from time to time contributed) has now been subsumed in I.

G. L. Hammond had called attention,912 it was clear that the quadripartite arrangement of Groups I-IV was insufficient for a complete taxonomy of our Type II swords, and I referred to the remaining weapons (including many for which published information was quite inadequate) as 'uncanonical'. There, for the time being, most of them must remain. But Bouzek has added, within his post-Mycenaean series C, a Group V, of which the Bitola sword in Istanbul913 is cited as the type-example; the most distinctive feature (no pommel ears or spur survive) is the arrangement of a set of three parallel relief ridges either side of an elliptical midrib. There are two rivets in the handguard, two in the grip. In his Group V Bouzek also places the fragmentary (hiltless) Samos weapon914 which also has ridges either side of the midrib, and the Cambridge weapon from Siteia, which has two rivets in the handguard and two ridges either side of the medial line. It is perhaps with this group that the Knossos weapon goes most readily. The group's other examples come from Macedonia and Epirus, which makes it difficult to explain it as a regional variety. If this is really where the our sword belongs, it seems to be the only example from a reliable context. There is so much that must be, or could be exotic in T. 201 that the sword is quite likely not to have been made in Crete. It is important to insist that it is quite distinct from the Mouliana and Myrsine swords; its context is probably a century later than any of those. The T. 201 sword has been treated by I. Kilian-Dirlmeier in her Die Schwerter in Griechenland (ausserhalb der Peloponnes), Bulgarien und Albanien, PBF IV:i2 (Stuttgart, 1993), 98, no.255 and pl.39.101. She attributes it to her Class C:3, other examples of which she identifies in Bulgaria, Albania, Thessaly, Boeotia and Crete itself (Mouliana). It is greatly to be regretted that this major study of swords had to exclude material from the Péloponnèse. This will be treated in a second volume. The Bronze Spearheads, 186. fl; 201. f8 (fig. 163; plate 277) These are splendid objects, 186. fi well preserved apart from the loss of its extreme tip, 2OI.ÍB in poor state, but well enough preserved to show the elegance of its design and the technical mastery with which it was made. Both blades are picked out with fine relief ridges which, unusually, extend onto the sockets. The original form of 2Oi.fB can only be surmised, but it cannot have been very close to the slim profile of i86.fi, also conspicuous for its unusually long socket, amounting to approximately 2/5 of the whole length of the weapon. There is a dearth of bronze spearheads found in eleventh-century BC contexts in the Aegean area, and it is difficult to decide whether our weapons could be typical of local production or whether they are exotic. The liking for fine relief ridges to decorate blade and socket recalls much earlier spear design in Crete, of which the best examples come from Hood's Hospital 906 Bouzek's Series A = Catling I. 907 Bouzek Series B: Hai 'Spurred swords and the Ennsdorf (Vy§n^ Sliafi) type' and IIa2, 'Swords with longer hilt than i and with a spur; long blade with parallel edges.' 908 Bouzek's Series B:III 'Short swords with spurred hilts, like the eastern variety of the Letten swords according to Cowen (Stätzling, according to Schauer).' 909 Antiquity 35 (1961), 117 nos. 14 and 16 = PPS 22 (1956), 113, nos. 11 and 13 = Kilian-Dirlmeier Sword nos. 242 and 247 respectively. 910 London 1 897/4-1/963. 911 BSA 63 (1968), 98-104, commenting on Hammond in Epirus, 319fr. 9i2 Loc. cit. 913 Antiquity 35 (1961), 118 no.33. 914 U.

The salient feature of these two weapons is the combination of fighting efficiency, elegance of design and mastery of bronze casting that they exhibit. The use of ridges, particularly as seen on 201 .£8, to enhance the blade suggests a design link with T 201 's Type II sword and perhaps, therefore, a common origin. The Bronze Arrowheads, T. 201. f2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (fig. 163; plate 280) Interest attaches to the variety of weapons buried with the T. 201 cremations: sword, spearhead and arrows. It is tempting to deduce that the warrior was equally proficient in the use of all three weapons. Arrowheads (or, perhaps, 'projectiles') of this size and variety of weights (from a minimum of 8.1 grammes to a maximum of 28.5) are uncommon in the Aegean; curiously, the best parallel for such a set in a tomb is the group of six in Knossos Hospital site Till.920 But this group must be nearly three hundred years earlier than ours, and there can be no direct connection. Nos. f3~6 conform to Type Vila of H-G. Buchholz5 classification of arrowheads.921 No. fe corresponds to his Type Vile. Examples of both types were found in the settlement of Karphi,922 though Pendlebury described one of them (Buchholz Vila) as a 'leaf-shaped spearhead'. The length, 11.2 cm, evidently misled him. The largest of the three Vile examples at Karphi only measured 7.1 cm, considerably smaller than our no. 2. Boardman923 describes further examples of Buchholz Vila and Vile arrows found in the Dictaean Cave, now in Oxford, and refers to others in Herakleion. Buchholz recognized that his Type VII arrowheads are non-Aegean and, correctly I am sure, pointed to the east for their origin. The publication of new material since the appearance of CBMWin 1964 has shown that, in Cyprus, particularly arrows of Type Vila are far more abundant than I could argue924 and are particularly richly represented at Enkomi.925 The 915 BSA 47 (1952), fig. 12, II.4; III.14 and V.7.

CATLING recent find at Hala Sultan Tekke of a multiple mould for casting arrowheads of Type Vila leaves no doubt that they were manufactured as well as used in Cyprus.926 In publishing the weapons from the French excavations at Enkomi, Courtois has reiterated that there is an abundance of this type of arrowhead in the Syro-Palestinian region.927 Though finds of such arrowheads in graves are very unusual, in Greece or elsewhere, there are one or two groups with which ours should be compared. Morricone has published what seems to have been an archer's tomb on Kos, Langada T. 34, of LH III C Early date.928 Arrowheads were found in both tombs at Lapithos, Ayia Anastasia (Cyprus).929 The four Type Vila arrowheads in Salamis Ti make a fairly closely matching find with our T 201 set.930 Salamis T. i, although it contains several PWP vases which would on their own be dated to LC III B, held a majority of WP I material and should not, according to M. Iakovou, be dated earlier than CG I A.931 Even so, it is close in date to T. 201. T 201 provides the first example of an Early Dark Age warrior-archer; his presence in the eleventh century BC in Crete need not be related to the later preeminence of Cretan archery, though, writing in 1964, A. M. Snodgrass932 was inclined to use the Karphi evidence to argue that a special role for Cretan archery may have existed from SM times onwards. This is a complex subject, beyond the scope of the present study. Almost certainly, Dark Age archery in Greek lands is a more intricate subject than the meagre surviving evidence allows us to suppose. Small Bronze Weapon Of Unknown Type, T.201.H7 (fig. 163; plate 280) This fragment of a narrow blade of flattened elliptical section, found folded double, has no distinguishing feature to enable certain identification. It is quite likely to have been a large arrowhead of Buchholz' Type VII, but the identification should not be pressed. Bronze Shield Bosses (Phalara), 186. f6; 201. fl6 (fig. 163; plate 274) It will, no doubt, be thought reactionary by some, if not provocative, to describe these two objects as 'Shield Bosses' at all. The standard work on the subject by Berthold Fellmann933 which is based on the hundred and ten examples (many of them consisting of no more than the solid-cast finial, or spike) found at Olympia, prefers to identify them as belt attachments. They have been quite thoroughly studied by other scholars. The most percipient accounts, I consider, are those given by A. M. Snodgrass,934 who has discussed the earlier literature. More recently, I. Vokotopoulou has published two examples from graves in the Vitsa Zagoriou cemetery,935 in which she argues for yet another use - as helmet attachments.

'Omphalia'.</page><page sequence="239">THE OBJECTS OTHER THAN POTTERY IN THE SUBMINOAN TOMBS 323 Vokotopoulou, as von Merhart before them, are surely correct in recognizing that no single identification can convincingly be used to explain the whole series, numbering over two hundred, dating from the late thirteenth century until at least the seventh, and showing quite considerable variations in size and form. The bosses - Snodgrass prefers to call them 'phalara', following von Merhart - consist of '....a bronze disc whose centre rises in a dome-like projection, often incorporating a spike....'936 As well as identification as shield boss, belt attachment or helmet-fitting, they have been explained as cymbals, horse-trappings or breast-ornaments. There is considerable variation in size. Fellmann, who adds a very useful survey of Greek material from sites other than Olympia, gives four reasons for preferring the belt-attachment explanation: 1 . Shields do not appear in early Greek warrior-graves. Proof of their existence must be substantiated by recognizable elements other than the 'phalara'. 2. The heterogeneous nature of the find-contexts is also against the identification. Phalara have been in the graves of both men and women, occur with weapons alone, or with a mixture of ornaments and weapons, or with ornaments alone. 3. The proposed method of attachment to the surface of the supposed shield is unacceptable. 4. Undoubted shield bosses (and he quotes the boss from Idalion as an instance) are not found in graves and differ in form by having reinforced rims. Fellmann, further, is inclined to interpret the boss (whatever its function) as a northern introduction to the Aegean. He supposes the earliest appearance in the Aegean will have been the group in Mouliana Tomb B. This is not quite certain. Two small phalara without finials/spikes were found with the bronze hoard at Pyla, Kokkinokremmos,937 where they were identified as cymbals. Also unknown to Fellmann is an example from Enkomi,938 also without finial/spike, of medium size (D. 13.8cm), with pointillé relief dots around the rim. The context is dated LC III. These new examples from Cyprus could be slightly earlier than the Mouliana group. There is certainly a hint of kinship between Enkomi and Mouliana in the pointillé ornament.939 Perhaps less certainly of LBA date is the phalaron published by Papadopoulos,940 found in the Patras Museum among bronze and iron objects said to be from Achladies- Achounia and Chadzi-Trapeza. Fellmann has not taken account of the strongest argument that shows our phalara actually were used as shield-bosses. This is the representation on the Enkomi conoid stamp-seal941 showing a warrior with plumed headdress crouching behind a large round or oval shield, in the centre of which a phalaron /shield-boss is clearly to be seen. It may have a finial/spike, but this is less sure. E. Porada, who published the seal,942 had no doubt that here was a boss. She saw the warrior as one of the Peoples of the Sea, and suggested that the device portrayed not the seal's owner himself, but his enemy.

W. CATLING suggest we respect Snodgrass' argument that no one explanation is adequate for all cases. Certainly the Vergina phalara943 show that the Early Iron Age practice in North Greece included decorative use, most probably on belts. But it does not necessarily follow that always and everywhere the use was the same. The great majority of phalara have been found in contexts a good deal later than the N Cemetery, contexts many of which (like the sanctuary deposits at Olympia, Delphi, Sparta, Kalapodi, Pherai and Philia) give no necessary help in identification of function. There is some evidence, however, that among the material that is earlier than, or nearly contemporary with the N Cemetery phalara, military associations are strong, viz:- i, 2. Cyprus.

Found with an iron knife; there was a spearhead elsewhere in the grave. Directly associated with other objects, for all of which I proposed a reconstruction as the facings of a shield made of perishable materials.944 This suggestion has had a somewhat mixed reception. Recently, Bouzek has suggested alternative reconstructions,945 in at least one of which no shield would be involved. 12. Tiryns, Tomb XXVIII D. With prominent fìnial/spike.

'200-c. 1000 BC, six (nos. 4-6, 7, 8 and 12) are closely associated with weapons. Another three (9- n) come from a tomb containing weapons. The remainder are indeterminate. It can of course, be argued that, weapons or no weapons, they might still be belt-ornaments rather than shield-bosses. I would concede that absolute proof of their function is lacking, but that common sense and such iconographical evidence as the Enkomi conoid and, indeed, the Sardinian bronze statuettes makes the use of some of nos 1- 13 as shield-bosses highly likely. I have purposely not attempted to relate our two phalara to Fellmann's typology, based as it necessarily is largely on material which by definition must be a good deal later than these. It is interesting that the finial/spike of 186. f6 goes closely with a much later example (only the finial survives) from Lefkandi, Toumba, Pyre 13, dated SPG I- II.946 Given the unsatisfactory evidence for arranging most of the known phalara in chronological sequence, there is little more to be done but note this fact.

Such a mixture of types is unsurprising in view of the very mixed set of twelve fibulae from the late SMyc. T. 108 in the Kerameikos948 and the slightly less heterogeneous group of eleven from the Lefkandi EPG tomb Skoubris T.6.949 This is Bouzek's cBow Fibula'950 of which he says: The derivation . . . from the violin bow type was natural enough. Its simultaneous spread over Greece, Italy and the western Balkans proves the existence of contacts along the Adriatic. . . . Since its spread over Greece is connected with the spread of long dress pins which have many more ancestors in N. Italy and in the N.W. Balkans than in Greece, a 'northern' origin for the bow fibula is more probable, but all three areas participated in the evolution of this type. For the very simple types of arch-bow fibulae to which our two belong, this seems an over- complicated account of origin. It is more reasonable to suppose that the form was devised in one place and thence diffused. It is not very clear where that area could have been, not least because the widely scattered material cannot be very closely dated. Nor is it very clear whether the entirely plain, small arch-bow fibulae precede fibulae of the same basic shape, whose bows thicken, or have traced ornament, or any of a variety of mouldings, or whether these appear first as a variant of the very complex series of 'Violin-Bow' fibulae, which first appear in Greece during the thirteenth century BC. The evidence of Perati951 rather suggests the latter may have been the case. Out of only eight fibulae found at the site, four were 'violin- bow', or derivatives, four were arch-bow, none of which conform exactly to the simple arch- bow pattern. It is, indeed, an over-simplification of the taxonomy to regard all arch-bow fibulae as part of a single evolutionary process. If we concentrate on the very straightforward versions whose only points of difference are to be found in the differing sections of the slim metal bars of which they are made (including under this heading the Blinkenburg II: 7,8 and 9 variants), we find a much more homogeneous series, some of the earliest examples of which have been found in twelfth and earlier eleventh century deposits at Enkomi in Cyprus.952 So far as concerns Cyprus, this type of fibula seems not to have lasted into the Early Iron Age - indeed, it may not have survived as late as the currency of PWP pottery in LC III B - the fibulae from Alaas are already of the angular form, with swelling bows and bosses/mouldings on them that was long to be the standard Cypriot fibula, exemplified by material from Skales.953 It is possible that our simple arch-bow fibula was actually developed in Cyprus during the later twelfth century by modifying the certainly imported violin-bow and derivative fibulae, of which a small number has been found, chiefly at Enkomi.954 It would have been brought from Cyprus to the Greek mainland and to Crete, where it remained in use for at least a hundred years, even if some areas were more conservative in retaining it than others.

According to Desborough961 all fibulae from the SMyc. cemetery on Salamis are of the arch-bow type.

Bronze Wheel-Shaped Pinhead, 200. f5 (fig. 164; plate 275) This unusual piece belongs to a small class of objects whose origins may well be Italian. The 'wheel' of four spokes, each of which branches into two before joining the 'felloe' of the 'wheel', must not be confused with the more common pin-heads consisting of a 'wheel' of six spokes which radiate from the 'hub' direct into the felloe.962 The chief discussion of our type of pin-head is that of H. Matthäus,963 additions to which have since been made byj. Bouzek,964 K. Kilian965 and A.

Matthäus refers to: 1. Grotta di Polla (near Paestum).974 Found in level IV, which included an imported Myc. fragment datable to the twelfth century. 2. Borgo Panigale (near Bologna).975 Found with Sub-Appennine pottery. 3. Porto Perone (near Leporano). Fragmentary; uncertain whether tin or lead.976 Context said to be equivalent to Myc. Ill B-c. In addition, pendants of the same form have been found in the Coste del Maraño hoard (Tolfa), of eleventh century date, and from the Proto- Villanovan urnfield at Fontanella.977 Both the comparable material and the context of our pin-head leave a number of questions unanswered, including function. While decorative use as a pin-head is likely, and it be assumed that the shaft had been of some perishable material,978 it is not the only possibility. The context of our head, where virtually all the other objects are decorative, strongly suggests that this is some kind of ornament, a role indicated for the Deiras head, found as it was with beads, etc. Certainly, the significance of the wheel-form is imponderable. Bouzek has argued that, whatever the ostensible function, these objects have a symbolism - 'They were connected with the Urnfield wheel symbolism, the symbol of the sun wagon on which the sun god is drawn across the sky by birds or horses. This symbolic meaning retained its significance in Greece until the Geometric...' While the normal six-spoked wheel-head pins are doubtless direct copies of actual wheel- forms, it is less clear that this is the case for our idiosyncratic version; Matthäus, for instance, doubts whether there were real wheels of this spoke-design. I feel the possibility should not be excluded. Though the chronology of the Knossos and Deiras heads is secure in the century 1 150-1050 BC, the remaining Greek examples float within the Bronze Age. The EG context of the Kastanas mould is perhaps best viewed as merely a terminus post quern non; it could be much earlier than this. Perhaps the puzzling incised circlets are secondary and the object, at the time of its loss, had acquired a quite different, non-functional use. Despite the fact that there are, if anything, more wheel-head pins of our type from Greece than Italy, not to mention the likelihood, in the view of the Kastanas mould, that some, at least, were actually made there, it remains more probable that they are of Italian, not Greek 972 Citing CMS V.2 (1975), 454, no. 572; Furtwängler- Loeschke, Mykenische Vasen (1886), 53. 973 Olympia IV, Die Bronzen (1890), pl. 13,210b. 974 Matthäus, op. cit.

Their relationship with the six-spoke wheels seems clear; these are evidently Italian, even if a small number has also been found in Greece.979 It therefore seems more likely that this uncommon variant developed where the dominant, six-spoke type originated. Bronze Object, 201. fl8 (fig. 164; plate 280) This fragment of something larger could have been part of a pair of depilatory tweezers, an explanation which would account for both the tapering shape of what remains and the relative thickness of metal. Complete examples rather earlier than this were reported from LH III C graves at Perati in Attica.980 Tweezers have a long history in the Aegean; the chronology of their several shapes is not particularly sensitive.981 There was a pair of tweezers (L. 11.5 cm) among the weapons of the early twelfth century group in Achaea, Kallithea, tomb B.982 Bronze Scraps, 200. f7 No diagnosis can be made for the three small crumbs in T. 200, apart from knowing they were once part of an object or objects belonging to the woman whose cremated remains lay in this grave. The two 'droplets' of metal also included under this number are equally anonymous; too much weight should not be given to the fact that they are adhering to small slivers of ivory. The Iron Dirk, 186. f5 (fig. 163; plate 274) A. M. Snodgrass983 has said of the companion piece in the SMyc. Tiryns T. XXVIII984 that it may well be the earliest all-iron weapon of this type found in Greece. Several points of interest are raised by these weapons, which unquestionably owe their basic design to the Type II bronze swords already referred to in discussing the sword in T. 201. A dominant question concerns the region in which, first, such a small weapon could have been designed; second, a region in which it might have been translated from bronze to iron. It has been suggested that Cyprus could fill both roles. On the one hand, bronze weapons that are scaled down versions of the original Sprockhoff Ha blades have been found there, particularly the Enkomi Old T. 47 dirk985 and, to a lesser extent, the Loizou sword.986 On the other, Cyprus has been championed by several scholars, including A. M. Snodgrass, as an innovative region in iron- working at the critical period. Perhaps the iron dagger (or dirk) L. 26 cm, with three bronze rivets in the hilt, found by Karageorghis at Kition Level II (later twelfth-first half eleventh century BC) may illustrate this process.987 Snodgrass has seen Cyprus as the region where working in iron is very likely to have progressed from '. . .Stage 1, in which iron is used with 979 These have been noted by Matthäus, op. cit. (n.74) i26ff. Of his list, only one, from Lefkas, Choirospilia (Alt-Ithaka (1927), 266f) and a bone example from the Athenian Acropolis (Hesperia 8 (1939), 413, fig. 8gd.) are well enough documented to command attention. 98° Perati II, 284-5. 981 See, e.g., Persson, Royal Tombs at Dendra, (Lund, 1931) 90.

His arguments have been questioned by J. Waldbaum, who is inclined to set aside the statistical case989 in seeking to identify the region responsible for iron-working innovation. There is, however, independent circumstantial evidence for close contact between Cyprus and Crete in the twelfth and eleventh centuries, as we have already seen, and shall see again when we examine the associations of the iron knives {infra). It remains a distinct possibility that the stride forward in iron-working did indeed take place in Cyprus, even if the evidence is lacking to identify the ethnic group responsible. This question is essentially distinct from the debate concerning early iron objects which incorporate bronze or copper elements, such as rivets for securing hilt-plates on swords and knives, or rings to close the divided tubular sockets of spearheads.990 It is important to note that both our dirk and the Tiryns dirk are of iron throughout. Several other iron dirks or daggers modelled on the Type II sword design have been found in slightly later contexts, and must be closely related to our weapon. These include:- 1.

The hilt, including a long, narrow pommel spur, is well preserved.995 The Iron Knives, 186. f2; 201,f9 (figs. 163-4; plate 274) One of our knives (201 .£9) is only a blade fragment, though sufficiently diagnostic for us to be sure of its identity. The other, with convex back and quite hooked tip, has a single bronze rivet in its rather short butt. It has a double interest, first as an early example from Crete of a working iron object, second as an instance of bimetallism (iron blade, bronze rivet). There are roughly contemporary Cretan parallels, including the oft-quoted Knossos: Gypsades T. VII. 12 knife (at 16 cm long, rather larger than ours) and a knife from Vrokastro TV (dimensions unknown to me).996 Bimetallism of this kind has aroused great interest, and has been very fully studied by J. Waldbaum.997 Some scholars, including J. Muhly, have indeed seen the iron knife with bronze/copper rivets as the distinctive 'type-fossil' of iron-working in the twelfth century BC 998 Though, as we have seen, Waldbaum is inclined to dissent from the view of Snodgrass and others that Cyprus played a key role in the development of iron-working during the 988 Metallurgy 286 (Snodgrass). 989 Waldbaum, From Bronze to Iron (Göteborg, 1978) and her 'Bimetallic Objects from the Eastern Mediterranean and the Question of the dissemination of Iron' in Metallurgy, 325-49- 990 See e.g., Waldbaum in Metallurgy, 339-44. 991 Kerameikos IV, 47, pl. 38.

CATLING twelfth and eleventh centuries, the relatively large number of iron objects, notably knives, found in Cypriot contexts of this date cannot be ignored. If Cyprus was not the originator, then the island must have been in very close contact with the area that was responsible, wherever that may have been. Waldbaum has argued that, though iron objects certainly became relatively very much more frequent in the twelfth and eleventh centuries BC, close scrutiny of the manner of use suggests they were still considered prestige objects999 and that, in effect, judgement should be suspended on the timing of the arrival of Snodgrass' Stage 2 in the development of iron- working where '. . . it (sc. iron-working) is used for practical purposes, but as yet less frequently than bronze.'1000 The difference between the two positions is not very great. Our new Knossos evidence adds two more instances where iron knives have been found with weapons; there is a close association between iron knives and early burials in the Kerameikos.1001 But such associations are not invariable, as the Lefkandi evidence shows.1002 Certainly, early iron knives in Cyprus do not themselves come from obvious warrior burials. Much closer study of the late development and distribution of bronze knives, and the appearance and early evolution of their iron successors, is needed before a more coherent and historically convincing account of them can be attempted. It could well be productive if less concern was directed towards the bimetallism knives, particularly now that Waldbaum has made it very clear that such bimetallism has a very long history from its first, twelfth century BC, appearance. Iron Dress Pins, 201. fll, 20 (fig. 163; plate 277) A. M. Snodgrass has convinced me that my original identification of these two pins (both lacking head and tip) was incorrect. I supposed them to be part of a single object, of uniform thickness, which I identified as an obelos, or spit. It was certainly not found in a single piece, but nor was the sword (£7), the spearhead (£8) or the stand (fi). However, identification as dress pins is more convincing, particularly with there being a double cremation in this grave, male and female. It would be natural to attribute a pair of pins to the woman. The shafts are c. 14-15011 long. Other roughly contemporary iron pins were found in Lefkandi: Skoubris T. 38, nos. 11, 12,1003 one of which, though heavily oxidized, was thought probably to have had a small button-head and an oval bulb on the upper part of the shaft. Iron pins have been found in other SMyc. tombs - Kerameikos Si 13, PG 22 and PG 23, 1004 though these graves are relatively late in the Attic sequence. The evidence is too slight to suggest whence these first iron pins might have originated. The Gold Jewellery, 200. f3, f8, flO; 201. flO (fig. 153; plate 265) With so much that is exceptional in the contents of Ts. 200 and 201, it is unsurprising to find a number of gold objects - a set of beads, presumably used for a necklace, a finger-ring and two roundels with impressed rosettes, rather crudely fashioned, from T. 200 and a finger-ring in T 999 Ob. cit. s?«. 1000 Metallurgy, 286. 1001 Lefkandi I, 2&lt;V7-8. 10°2 ¿qC, at.

I am doubtful whether the rosette-roundel 40. f2 is SM, and have not taken it into account in what follows. Contemporary burials on the mainland and in the Islands rarely include gold jewellery, as Desborough has explained;1005 Higgins,1006 however, implies that the period was richer than Desborough allows. Nevertheless, by comparison with the rich diversity of gold ornaments recovered from the tombs of the high Mycenaean period1007 these were very lean years. Though the little beads of T. 200 are of very simple form, which can approximately be matched among beads of Mycenaean date,1008 an equally convincing match can be found in Cyprus, where L. Aström classified this as her gold bead Type 1 ('Depressed globular, or roughly biconical, plain bead, in some cases with one or two rings at either end.')1009 which occur throughout the LC period. She cites examples from Enkomi, Kourion, Hala Sultan Tekke, Klavdia and Maroni. Some of these (e.g., the Maroni examples) are hollow, and not a close match for ours. A very similar bead was still in use in the post-Bronze Age period1010 '...from the CG to the CC period'. In Bronze Age use, simple beads of this form were sometimes used with more complex beads to make up a necklace.1011 It is impossible to decide whether or not these beads were of great age at the time of burial. The stamped rosette-roundels, whose stitch-holes imply attachment to clothing or shrouds, echo a long tradition of jewellery, much of it funerary, of an earlier age, both on the Greek mainland, and on Crete. The use was very common at Mycenae,1012 for instance. Perhaps the most splendid are those from Chamber T. 10 at Dendra.1013 More typical examples were found nearby at the Argive Heraion1014 and at Asine.1015 Further afield, there were rosettes in the Menidi tholos.1016 Others were found at Epano Englianos, in Tholos III.1017 Rosettes occur at Knossos, notably among the rich group of jewellery in Sellopoulo T.4.1018 Although some of the gold bands with impressed ornament that occur regularly in rich LC tombs are decorated with rosettes,1019 rosette-roundels do not appear in the full LC period. They have been reported, however, several times in very early CG contexts,1020 and it is likely that there is a genuine connection between Crete and Cyprus in this as in several other respects already mentioned. There is as yet no evidence to show how this happened, though it is possible that the use of the rosette-roundel was introduced to Cyprus early in the twelfth century and brought back to Crete much later - perhaps in the mid-eleventh century. The rings are early examples of a type of plain ring which, as Higgins has shown, was very popular in DA Lefkandi1021 where nineteen examples came from SPG I- III contexts. He suggests that the source for these rings may have been Cyprus, though the evidence is not wholly convincing. 1005 GDA iiQ. 1006 Lefkandi L 218. 1007 See e.g., Taphi, passim. 1008 E.g. the hollow beads of Taphi 292, Type 2, from Mycenae OT 8, X.2302 (one example); op. cit. 65, pl. 7 and OT io, X.2306; op. cit. 70, pl. 70. 1009 SCE IV.iD &lt;'i and fur. 6^.24. 1010 SCE IV.2, 164, fig. 35.5 and p. 222. 1011 E.g.

Combs have been exhaustively studied by H-G. Buchholz1022 who has provided a comprehensive typology, with the fine details of which we need not be concerned. Our comb is one-sided, with a plain rectangular grip, conforming to Buchholz Type Ilia - other variant Type III combs differ in the shape of the grip or, in some cases, the use of figured decoration. The grip is divided into zones in Type IV ('Zonenkämme5), sometimes decorated with a central relief rosette, sometimes with relief designs in the zones. Type V combs in their several variant forms are double (that is, sets of teeth either side of the grip ('Doppelkämme'). Type Ilia is described by Buchholz1023 as 'Rectangular flat comb toothed on one side with or without a suspension-hole; individual examples vary in relative height and width.' The grip of Type Ilia combs may be picked out with simple incised linear designs. A good example of Type Ilia, showing what the original appearance of ours will have been, comes from Schliemann's excavations on the Mycenae acropolis.1024 The date of this piece is uncertain. The fragmentary comb in the LH II- III Ai Chamber T. XXIII in the Athenian Agora1025 illustrates the simple manner in which this category of comb may be decorated. A very similar comb was found at Enkomi, in a context over two hundred years later, in Area I of the Cyprus Museum's excavation, on the threshold between Rooms 3 and 8 of the Ashlar Building, in Level IIIA.1026 The grip is picked out by simple horizontal incised lines. Neither the Agora nor the Enkomi comb has a suspension-hole. Our comb is the first example of Type Ilia to be reported from Crete.1027 The use of combs, whether ivory, bone or wood, seems to have been more widely spread on the mainland than on Crete, to judge from Buchholz' published statistics,1028 where fifteen Cretan examples are set against fifty-four from the Argolis alone. Buchholz argues, indeed, that so far as the Aegean was concerned, it was the mainland that was responsible for developing design and ensuring widespread internal distribution. Though combs were common during the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries BC, they also retained their popularity during the twelfth, as is made clear by the fourteen combs reported by Iakovides from Perati.1029 Unfortunately, many of them are very poorly preserved; the two of which drawings have been published appear to be Zonenkämme of Buchholz Type IVa.1030 Nevertheless, ivory objects of any description are very rare in either SM or SMyc. contexts, so the finds from Ts. 200 and 201 take on an added importance. Desborough1031 comments on this rarity in discussing the ivory-headed pins from Knossos, Ay. Ioannis.1032 Styrenius has only one ivory object to mention from the SMyc. tombs of both the Kerameikos and Salamis.1033 1022 Ägäische Kamme' in Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica 16/17 (1984/85), 91-142. 1023 Op. cit. 117. 1024 Ob. cit., 122, fies. v*-±. 1025 Immerwahr, The Athenian Agora XIII: The Neolithic and Bronze Ages (Princeton, 1971), 220, no. 7, and pl. 51. 1026 Dikaios, Enkomi I, 181; II, 692, no. 2254, pl. 32.2, which shows the object in situ.

There is no very compelling reason to look to Cyprus as a place of origin (where the Doppelkämme are much more frequent); given the relative wealth of combs at Perati in the twelfth century, the mainland would be a strong candidate, were there any sign in SMyc contexts of comparable material. The Ivory Mounting, 201. fl2 (fig. 164; plate 278) For the circumstances of discovery, see 'Boar's Tusks'. The state of preservation was extremely poor; what seemed probably all to be fragments of the same object amounted to some eight pieces preserving part of the outer, carved surfaces and eighty more small bits, many of them calcined, none of them certainly retaining an outer surface. Though the piece was probably some kind of handle, it cannot be related to any of the surviving objects in the grave. Since it seems to have been designed to allow the flattish tang of a metal object to slide inside a socket and be covered, it has no place with the sword, the spear, or the arrowheads. Nor could it have been fitted to any known type of knife to which the blade fragment fg could have belonged. Regrettably, the piece is likely to remain unidentified until a better-preserved example is found in associations where its function can be understood. Compass-drawn dot-and-circle ornament, and dot-and-concentric-circle ornament occurs on ivories found in LH contexts,1034 including a tapering strip from the tomb at Spata, and several items from Mycenae.1035 Dot-and-circle ornament is one of the main decorative elements on the remarkable ivory tube, identified by Karageorghis as an opium-pipe, from Kition Area II, between Floors IIIA and III.1036 The Bone Inlays, 201.H4A and 14B (fig. 164; plate 278) The circumstances of discovery are described below s.v. Boar's Tusks. Though there can be no certainty, it is quite possible that both sets of inlays (for such seems the most likely identification) belong to a single object, all trace of which was otherwise irretrievably lost from the moment of cremation. Doubtless other pieces of inlay were overlooked when the remains were gathered up following the fire. It is difficult to look for parallels, or, if similar objects can be traced, to feel any confidence in asserting similar use in a hypothetical similar object. Twenty-six triangular and two rectangular inlays, the former with one, the latter with two stitch-holes, were found in Perati Ti, in a pit containing the cremated remains of two human beings and a dog, as well as a number of other small objects. This group is dated Perati Phase I (1190/85-1 165/60 BC).1037 Iakovides does not offer an explanation. Rectangular inlays (?) have been found in Cyprus, in Swedish T. 13 (no. 14) at Amathus, dated CG HI by the excavators.1038 This was an archer's tomb, to judge from the fifteen iron arrowheads among its contents. There were similar inlays from Ts. 50 and 76 at Palaepaphos Skates, both of which 1034 Poursat, Les Ivoires mycéniens (Paris, 1977), 254. 1035 Including the use of compass on roundels from the acropolis, (Schliemann), Catalogue pl. 1, no. 11 (nos. 1030-31, 1033, 1569); others from the House of Sphinxes, Catalogue pl. 14, 187/7996; 15, nos. 186/7536, 188/7558; others from the House of Shields, Catalogue pl. 9, 119/7409 (double circles, with linking tangents as a false running spiral); 117/7484, as filling ornament used to pick out incised swags on a plaque.

If we guess at the identity of the object in which these inlays once figured, we can either choose something connected directly with the other contents of the grave, or strike out for something completely different. In the absence of comparanda, the latter course is unpromising. I suggest, faut de mieux, that the kind of object involved might have been a scabbard for the sword £7, or a quiver for the arrows fa-flS. Much less likely would be an ornamental box to contain the four-sided stand. It is particularly tantalizing that this object eludes us, for its true identity would have been of great help in giving still sharper definition to the remarkable individuals commemorated by T. 201. The Boar's Tusk Fragments, 201. fl3 (fig. 164; plate 279) During excavation, as elsewhere explained, the mass of fragments of cremated human bone was bagged separately and set aside for the expert anthropological study of J. H. Musgrave. During his examination, he isolated a number of items which had been incorrectly identified in the field, including pieces of worked bone, pieces of carved ivory and a number of fragments of what were subsequently identified by Sheilagh Wall (Mrs. Crowther) as slices of boar's tusk. Miss Wall was at that time working at Knossos on the field study of the animal remains from Professor P. M. Warren's excavation of the Stratigraphie Museum Extension site. I am extremely grateful to Miss Wall for her study of this material, and to Dr. Musgrave, who had been quick to correct the mistake made by us in the field. Though absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed, given the damaged condition of the fragments, these nineteen pieces of boar's tusk (one, perhaps two with the remains of stitch- holes preserved) are most likely to represent a boar's tusk helmet. If they do, this will be much the latest example to have survived in corpore and would, I believe, provide the supreme archaeological illustration of the survival, long after the helmet-type had become obsolete, of an helmet-heirloom. It would very neatly fit that passage of Homer best-known to Aegean prehistorians, in Iliad X. 261 if, where the poet describes the arming of Odysseus by Meriones, and goes out of his way to explain how so antiquated a piece of equipment could still be available for use: this helmet originally came from Eleon, where Autolykos stole it from Amyntor, son of Ormenos, by breaking into his well-built home. Autolykos gave it to Amphidamas of Kythera to take to Skandeia, and Amphidamas gave it to Molos in return for hospitality. Molos, in his turn, gave it to his son Meriones to wear, and now it was Odysseus' head it served to cover. The Iliad X passage singled out that helmet for a detailed description because of its very unusual design; the design was unusual because it was an antique, as its pedigree - Amyntor - Autolykos - Amphidamas - Molos - Meriones - Odysseus - makes clear. 1039 Skales T. 50.11, pl. 68. fig. 94; T. 76.119, pl. 144, fig. 143.</page><page sequence="251">THE OBJECTS OTHER THAN POTTERY IN THE SUBMINOAN TOMBS 535 There is no need to review the evidence, representational and in corpore, for the boar's tusk helmet. This has recently been collected by A. P. Varvaregos,1040 whose bibliography details other important studies of Aegean helmet-types, including those of J. Borchhardt and E. Kukahn. While the origins of the helmet evidently go back to the MBA, as finds from Eutresis in Boeotia and Eleusis show,1041 'he floruit of use in corpore belongs to the fifteenth and earlier fourteenth centuries. One of the best-known and best-published examples came from one of the Mycenae chamber tombs excavated by A. J. B. Wace, T.518.59.1042 From the LH III Ai Panoply Tomb at Dendra came a boar's tusk helmet and a pair of bronze cheek-pieces, held to mark a transitional stage in helmet-development between the boar's tusk-covered cap, and the cap all of bronze, illustrated by the helmet from Knossos, Hospital Site Tomb V1043 This explanation of a transitional helmet-type is a trifle simplistic, given the near contemporaneity of the Knossos and Dendra tombs. Until the discovery of our boar's tusk fragments, the latest known example had been the three fragmentary 'tusks' from Achaea, Kallithea Tomb B,1044 whose context is dated to the early twelfth century by the associated LH III C pottery. The Beads, 121. f3; 200. f2, f6, f9, fll, fl4 (figs. 162, 164; plate 275) At first sight, this little collection, from only two tombs, is a meagre set of ornaments of this type. But such is the scarcity of evidence for SM or SMyc. jewellery anywhere that this is, in fact, a relatively rich collection, including items of glass, faience and stone. The single glass bead from T. 121, a flattened sphere, may have been worn as an amulet. As well as the parallels cited below, it recalls a rather larger faience bead, also found as a singleton, in the Kouklia (Palaepaphos) Kaminia T.i, no.4. This unpublished tomb is dated LC III B by a PWP stirrup jar, and is thus virtually contemporary with our T. 121. The six beads, and a conulus, in T. 200 may have been used as a small necklace, perhaps worn closer to the throat than the gold necklace, f8. Four of the beads - £B, 9, 11 and 14 - are not particularly distinctive, though parallels are doubtless to be found in the Aegean area in the full BA for such spherical beads of different materials. The two 'seed-shaped' - Pamygdaloid - faience beads, £2, are more specific, and, once again, suggest a class of object whose origin was Aegean, which was translated to Cyprus, and may have been brought back again, as here. The type is familiar enough on the Greek mainland, at Mycenae for instance,1045 with other examples from the Epano Englianos Tholos III.1046 Examples in Cyprus include those from Kition, Floor IV in Area II, dated LC II Ci and 2.1047 Others come from Hala Sultan Tekke,1048 and there are two, unpublished, in the Kouklia Asproyi T VII, nos. 13 and 14. 1049 1040 j-Q Odontophrakton Kranos, Dissertation (Athens, 1981). 1041 For Eutresis, H.

W. CATLING The Stone Conulus, 200. fl2 (fig. 164; plate 275) This rather battered 'button' belongs to a very familiar class of object of the full Aegean BA, which has been discussed a good many times, notably by S. Iakovides, who has collected references to the most important previous studies.1050 He suggests that they were used as '...dress weights, attached to the hem of skirts'. There is a variety of forms, of which our simple truncated cone seems to be the earliest. New versions, however, did not oust earlier designs, '...all forms existing down to the end of the Mycenaean period.'1051 Whatever the merits of the proposal that they were used as dress-weights, ours, almost certainly, was in secondary use, and seems likely to have been a bead or an amulet. The Whetstones, 186.f3, f4 (fig. 163; plate 274) As these two rather different whetstones belonged to the same person, we may infer they played different roles in keeping his tools and weapons sharp. For instance, f± may have been used dry, ï$ with oil as a medium, as suggested by D. Evely in discussing various types of whetstone found in the Minoan Unexplored Mansion at Knossos.1052 Bronze spearhead, iron dirk, iron knife may all have been kept keen by these two stones. There seems to have been rather erratic use of whetstones as grave goods during the Aegean BA. Unsurprisingly, where stones are found, they are usually associated with weapons. As finds in Grave Circle A at Mycenae show,1053 they occur with the burials of grandees, further confirmed by the two examples from the LH I- II grave circle at Epano Englianos1054 and the LH I- II warrior burial (including the bronze épaulière of a corslet) from T.8 at Dendra.1055 They seem to be largely missing from the main run of LH chamber tomb cemeteries. Two are reported from Tsountas' Mycenae chamber tombs, but one of these is in fact a terracotta object, and the other was left unregistered, and cannot be traced.1056 None seems to have been found in the chamber tombs dug by A. J. B. Wace; only one (from T. X, unillustrated) came from Blegen's tombs at the Argive Heraion.1057 There was none in the tombs in the Athenian Agora. Three were reported by Morricone from tombs in Kos.1058 At Knossos, Evans found four in the Zapher Papoura cemetery,1059 all associated with knives, razors and a sword. Much the closest parallels for our whetstones in size, form and material are given by the twelve examples in the CG cemetery at Palaepaphos Skales. These have been discussed by C. Elliott.1060 The contexts range from CG I A until CA I; they occur single in eight tombs,1061 while there are two in each of two other tombs.1062 Five of them, perhaps as many as seven, come from CG I contexts, while only one is perhaps as late as CA I. Their material is predominantly schist or sandstone. Their characteristic shape is elongated rectangular (as 1050 BSA 72 (1977), 1 13-19. 1051 hoc. cit. 1052 Ponham et ai, UM I, 226-7. 1053 Karo, SG, Grave IV, pl. 102,512; Grave V, p. 149, nos. 860-61; Grave VI, 163, fie. 7Q.Q3O. 1054 pjVIII, 161, fig. 232.2, found in the cauldron in Pit 2; p. 167 and fig. 232.3. loss Frödin and Persson, op. cit.

Seven of the Skales whetstones came from tombs which also contained iron knives,1065 of which three, perhaps five came from CG I contexts. There is another close parallel for f3 in the CG Ia grave Kaloriziki T.39 (measuring x5-8 * 5-3 * l-% complete); it had been placed, together with an iron knife, inside a krater- amphora containing a cremation.1066 It is possible that a 'loomweight' found in Kaloriziki T.40, inside the bronze cremation urn, described as 'truncated pyramidal type' and 'particularly elongated', of light brown soft stone, may have been misidentified, and was actually a whetstone. I do not recall loomweights elsewhere in tombs of grandees. Rather earlier Cypriot examples come from tombs at Kouklia, dated from the twelfth to the early eleventh century BC 1067 One of these very closely resembles £4, though its material (hornstone) is different; its context is dated in the twelfth century. DA whetstones are rare. There is one from the EG I Areiopagos warrior grave in Athens.1068 There was none in any of the Kerameikos or Salamis SMyc. graves. None was found in the Lefkandi cemeteries. But the 'heroic' burial in the Dark Age building at Toumba did include a large whetstone, which had been placed inside the cremation urn. The date of this complex is close to 1000 BC. Three quite different possibilities emerge from this very incomplete survey, none of which should be pressed too hard. The use of whetstones has a close, but not unvarying relationship with weapon-burials. Several of these are the burials of grandees (Mycenae SG, Dendra, Epano Englianos Grave Circle, Lefkandi 'hero' burial). Such a connection may increase the likelihood - already strong - that the occupant of T. 186 had himself been a grandee - in SM terms. Second, there seems a systematic relationship between whetstones and cremation urns. To put it another way, where a whetstone accompanies a cremation, it is likely to be placed in the urn. That is certain at Kaloriziki T. 39 and Lefkandi, Toumba, quite likely at Kaloriziki T. 40. By coincidence, there is an early instance of the placing of a whetstone in a vessel, in the Epano Englianos Grave Circle. Third, the resemblance between our whetstones and the Skales series is too circumstantial for coincidence - there must be some kind of relationship. 1063 T. 89.104 = Skales 322 and pl. 189; T. 89.126 (Pincomplete) and T. 55.3 = pl. 80 and fig. 100. 1064 As T. 43.155, op. cit. pl. 25 and fig. 51. 1065 Ts. 63, 64, 76, 83, 89. 1066 Kaloriziki 49; 125, no.

HlGGINS SUBMINOAN The SM jewellery is surprisingly rich for what is generally regarded as a lean period in Crete, as indeed throughout the Aegean world. 200. £8 is a string of 81 minute beads of solid gold, some drum-shaped, some flattened- globular. Such beads, paralleled after a fashion in a contemporary grave in the Athenian Kerameikos,1069 are unknown in the Late Minoan repertoire, and constitute a new development; Cypriot inspiration is probable.1070 Finger rings are represented by two convex hoops of stout sheet gold, one complete (201. fio) and one fragmentary (200. fio). Rings of this kind are also foreign to the late Minoan repertoire, and are also in all probability of Cypriot inspiration. They are common in Athens and at Lefkandi in the ninth century1071 Another variety of finger ring, whose bezel only survives, is represented by Q.f&lt;). This bezel of sheet gold is elliptical in shape, with pointed ends. It is decorated with a pattern in dot-repoussé; and in the centre is a hole for a rivet which originally attached it to the hoop. Such a bezel is so far unique in gold, but a number of bronze rings with similar bezels are known. One, from Kalapodi in Phocis, Boeotia, is dated to LH III C.1072 Examples from Athens and Corinth are SMyc1073 and a number from the Dictaean Cave in Crete are undated.1074 On balance, and although Tomb Q, contains no pottery earlier than MPG, a LM III C or (more probably) a SM date for this object is almost inevitable. This type of bezel is evidently derived directly from a type known from Mouliana and Photoula1075 and indirectly from the standard Minoan-Mycenaean 'shield ring'.1076 Clothing ornaments of thin sheet-electrum in the form of rosettes are represented by 40. f2 and 200. £3. Such rosettes are standard in Late Minoan and Mycenaean equipment.1077 They are common enough in Crete in LM III A and B, and it must be purely fortuitous that no examples have yet been recorded in LM III C to bridge the gap. Protogeometric and Geometric The very scrappy jewellery from the N Cemetery for this long period is evidently nothing but gleanings after the depredations of the tomb-robbers, and it cannot be regarded as truly representative. If, however, we combine the evidence from these tombs with that from the other Dark Age Knossian cemetery at Fortetsa,1078 we get some sort of a picture. 1069 Unpublished; but see GRJ' 89. 1070 BMC Jewellery, no. 622. 1071 Lefiandil, 221. 1072 R.

A. HIGGINS It appears that by iooo BC the Minoan tradition had finally run its course, and continuing contacts with Cyprus gradually initiated a rather impoverished style, which prevailed for some two centuries. About 800 BC a new and vastly superior style, the product of a so-called Teke School, was introduced from some Levantine source. It is represented here by the pendant 18. £3. We can now consider the jewellery of this period from the N Cemetery. A funerary diadem of gold foil is represented by two fragments, 75^40- 41« They are embossed with curvilinear decoration in a manner reminiscent of a diadem from a grave in Athens of 900-850 BC;1079 but this diadem cannot be earlier than the late ninth century, when T. 75 received its first cremations. A pair of gold hoop earrings (104 .fis) was found in a severely disturbed G tomb. They are made of gold wire with tapering ends, which are hooked together. Similar, but flimsier, hoop earrings occur in gold at Fortetsa in one tomb of the tenth century and another of the later ninth,1080 and in bronze in a tenth century tomb at Vrokastro.1081 A Cypriot origin is not improbable,1082 but such a simple form could equally well be an independent local creation. By far the finest piece of jewellery from the N Cemetery is a Minoan oval seal of amethyst mounted in a gold setting (i8.f3). It is engraved with a scene of a lion attacking a seated agrimi.10*3 The stone is bezel-set in gold, with a twisted wire soldered over the setting. A line of granulation follows the outline of the stone, but leaves it to go round four projections, an elaborate one at the top and three plainer ones at the bottom. The stone has a gold backing equipped with two transverse loops for attachment. At some earlier period the stone has been pierced for suspension at the top, as it is now set. The superb craftsmanship of the gold work suggests the Teke School' at its best, which would date this jewel around 800 BC or soon after, a date consistent with the pithos i8,8 with which it was associated.1084 This is not the only example of the re-use of a Minoan seal at a later date; Boardman lists a number of other instances.1085 There are two finger rings. The first (59.fi) is a carinated hoop of sheet gold. The type had a long life. It is recorded at Lefkandi in the mid-ninth century and at Athens and Corinth in 1078 Brock, F. iotf, and refs. 1079 AM I (1968), 22, fig. 5 (top). loso p nos n6} 1 105. 1081 E. H.

Pini comment that oval seals are quite rare in Minoan glyptic, though some were in use at the end of the MM II to impress sealings at Phaistos (CMS II. 5, 258-9, 276-7, 304-6). The convex face of those seals suggests that they may have been rings of the kind which became common later in precious metal and are found occasionally in stone (CMS I, 20, V Suppl IA, 197-8). One- piece stone rings were fragile and, if the hoop broke, might be modified for insertion in some other setting; the slightly concave back of the stone suggests that it may have been cut down in this way. Alternatively, it was originally designed for insertion in a setting, like CMS IV, 58D. The agrimi seated on base-lines is reminiscent of a number of fine MM III discoid seals (CMS 11.3,340; X, 281; XII,i37; XIII, 19), though the rather heavier body and the use of solid-drill for hooves (cf. CMS VII, 42; XII, 135) might make it a little later (?MM III-LM I). The lion (or hound), with its smooth mane, wasp-waist and pronounced solid-drilling, could be as late as LM IIIa (CMS VII,i76) and may indicate alteration of or addition to the original motif which must, however, have shown something in that position, since the agrimi was not centrally placed. It may have been at this late date that the stone was cut down and the lion changed (though the drilled lion paws and goat hooves seem similar). At the same time, or a little later, the engraved face was drilled through between the lion's hind legs so that the stone could be suspended; and in its final phase it was introduced into its present gold setting with 'ivy leaf at one end, which Dr. Pini believes cannot have been made after the Late Bronze Age. io84 GR¥, 108 and refs. loss y Boardman, Greek Gems and Finger Rings (London, 1970), 107, 399.</page><page sequence="256">THE JEWELLERY ^ the eighth century.1086 In view of the O date of T. 59 we should probably date this example at the end of the eighth century. The second finger ring is the archetypal Minoan 'shield ring' (Q.fio). The type certainly outlived the Minoan period,1087 but it is not clear whether they were still being produced at the time when this burial took place (probably 870-840 BC), or whether it was an heirloom at the time of its deposition. A pair of dress pins (J.fy and 7) is dated to E-MPG. They are made of gold wire, cast and hand-finished. The shaft is circular in section. The head is composed of a conical knob resting on a member of circular section which rests on a member of rectangular section, with slightly in-curving sides. These pins are apparently unique, but probably derive from a type recorded in gold from a tomb at Forte tsa in a tenth century context.1088 A pomegranate ornament of gold foil (N.f^) of about 800 BC was originally a covering for an object, perhaps a pin-head, of some other material such as wood, bone, or ivory.1089 A somewhat similar gold pomegranate, also of uncertain use, was found in a tomb at Arkades.1090 What was originally catalogued as a mass of gold leaf turned out, after conservation, to be a scene, in thin gold foil, of a man between two lions (2ig.fgi). The gold foil was evidently a covering for an unidentified object of some perishable material such as wood or leather. From the appearance of the gold it is not possible to distinguish the front of this group from the back; but it may be assumed that the man is holding his dagger in his right hand. The ensuing description is based on this assumption, and is also based on a much clearer version of the same motif which occurs on a bronze quiver from a tomb at Forte tsa.1091 A hero or warrior stands between two rampant lions. He wears a short-sleeved tunic, a short kilt, a belt and a conical helmet with a crest. With his left hand he holds up the front right paw of a lion. His right arm hangs by his side, a dagger in the hand. The context dates this group to about 750 BC. This piece, with the Fortetsa quiver and a strip of gold foil with a scene of two confronted lions from a tomb at Fortetsa, forms part of a group which has been put together by Boardman.109? It is not easy to suggest the purpose of this piece. It could have decorated a piece of furniture such as a footstool, or possibly a leather bag. Even more mysterious are two rectangular pieces of gold foil, 285. £38-39, which are dated by context to LPG-PGB. Holes at the corners indicate that they were originally pinned or sewn to some object now lost, perhaps of wood, ivory or leather. Finally, two small omphalos-like ornaments of sheet gold (48. f2, N.fe). The former is quite plain except for a central boss and has two holes at opposite sides of the rim for attachment to some other object, now lost. Its date is uncertain. The latter, probably of about 800 BC, is similar, but has an additional hole in the centre of the boss and a pattern in dot-repoussé round the rim. 1086 Lefkandi I, 222, pl. 230C.

HIGGINS Objects like this are fairly common in gold and bronze.1093 They may well be ultimately of Cypriot origin,1094 but their purpose has been much disputed. They are seen as models of shield bosses, and this seems a reasonable explanation. A recent study, however, would explain them as models of horse-frontlets.1095 Orientalizing We cannot regard this meagre group of jewellery as typical of what was a rich period in Crete. Like the PG and G material, it must represent what the tomb-robbers overlooked. Contacts with the Near East are still apparent, but the oriental influences probably reached Crete indirectly through the art of Eastern Greece, which was now exerting a strong influence on the island. A hoop of thin gold wire (4O.f4) comes from a seventh century deposit. The ends, which overlap, are twisted round the hoop. It was probably a hair-ring. Similar objects occur in bronze in Crete;1096 but the closest parallel comes from a tomb at Assarlik, the ancient Termera, in Caria, of 800-750 BC.1097 A pair of electrum earrings comes from a tomb of about 700 BC (79.fi3- 14). They consist of a coil of thick wire with expanded ends, which are turned back in opposite directions. Such earrings are common in Rhodes and also occur at Ephesus.1098 The date-range is fairly wide, apparently covering the eighth and seventh centuries. A Syrian or Phoenician origin for the type is probable.1099 Four beads (285.fi 9) come from an EO deposit. They are biconical, with slightly flanged ends, and are ribbed. Wide holes at the end indicate that the beads were originally filled with some other substance, such as terracotta or plaster. Somewhat similar beads occur in Rhodes and at Ephesus in seventh century contexts.1100 A Cypriot or Phoenician origin for this type is likely1101 Next, 182.fi, a gold pendant in the form of a lion's mask. This somewhat peculiar way of representing a lion's mask was particularly common in Cretan art in the seventh century.1102 In view of the Geometric date of this deposit, we should probably be correct in putting this pendant at the very end of the eighth century. A bee pendant (io7.fi6) is a close companion to the foregoing. The dating from context is EO, which fits well. A similar bee pendant comes from a tomb at Fortetsa of about the same date; and a third (undated) from a burial at Arkades.1103 A boar's tusk mounted in silver (292.35) comes from a tomb of PGB-O date. A seventh century dating is suggested by the occurrence of a somewhat similar gold-mounted tusk in the Artemision at Ephesus.1104 Finally 26^7, a cylindrical gold object, pierced at the upper end, of O date. Its purpose is not clear, but it could have been a capping for the upper part of a needle of bone, ivory or wood. 1093 Ann. 10-12 (iq27-q), 468, pl. 8 and refs. 1094 a.

Catling Introduction Complete, or fragmentary bronze objects, shattered fragments of sheet bronze, unidentifiable lumps and pellets of metal were recovered from 53 post-Subminoan, Dark Age and Orientalizing tombs. Over 500 inventoried items were recorded, amounting to several thousand individual pieces of bronze, the total weight of which was in excess of fifteen kilos.1105 This, however, is not a large quantity of metal, given the number of tombs, and the richness of many of them. For instance, the ox-hide copper ingots of the late Bronze Age in the Mediterranean, so many of which are now known from land-hoards, settlements finds, and the wrecked cargoes of Cape Gelidonia and Ulu Burun, weigh individually on a scale from fifteen to nearly forty kilos. Thus, a single ingot can comprise more than twice the weight of bronze recovered from the whole of the N Cemetery. Everything points to the survival of only a small fraction of the original contents of these 53 tombs. As other sections of this report have emphasised, nearly all the graves had been disturbed, to a greater or lesser degree. There were several deleterious effects of this disturbance which, in many graves, began very soon after the first use, when chambers were reopened for the insertion of additional cremation urns and their accompanying grave gifts. Where such action disturbed earlier urns and their gifts, the effect was often to damage, by crushing or twisting, bronze objects whose metal had not yet lost all malleability through the destructive effects of oxidization. In other cases, part collapse of the soft kouskouras tomb roofs or walls was responsible for similar distortion, notably in the case of thin-walled bronze vessels. As oxidisation advanced, and malleable metal was entirely replaced by the products of this process, the objects became extremely brittle, so that disturbance would not only distort the objects involved, but in many cases shatter them into fragments far smaller than the sherds into which such disturbance reduced many of the pottery vessels in the same tombs. If a bronze vessel shatters in this fashion, but the pieces remain articulated, escaping further disturbance, skilled treatment and restoration may succeed in repairing the object. If, however, as happened in nearly all the N Cemetery, disturbance continues, these once articulated fragments will have been scattered broadcast within the tomb itself, or thrown out into the dromos, or even beyond the limits of the tomb, there irretrievably to be lost. Take, for instance, what remains of the once fine rod tripod 100. £4. This can only represent about 5% of the original stand; all the rest disappeared during the succession of vicissitudes to which the tomb was subjected during its long history. 1105 Details of weight were recorded for the bronzes recovered from the tombs dug in 1978 and 1979; these details are wanting for the Teke tombs, excavated earlier.</page><page sequence="259">544 H- w- CATLING With an object such as a rod tripod there would be a very good chance of complete repair, if all the pieces survived, no matter how far scattered they had been in chamber and dromos fillings. The components are sufficiently distinctive, and solid enough, to present no serious difficulty to an experienced conservator. Unfortunately the position is very different when undecorated vessels of sheet metal are concerned. The combined factors of distortion, shattering, complete oxidisation of the fragments, including protrusion of oxides on the fractures themselves, coupled with complete uniformity of surface appearance from one shattered vase to another, mean that with resources at present available, the scattered fragments of round-bodied, undecorated bronze vessels cannot be recomposed. The same is unfortunately true of the bronze facing fragments several of which were recovered - even though the edges and stitch-holes exist to offer some clue to form, shape and size. A further indication of loss comes from a comparison of those tombs where cremation urns were found undisturbed, containing funerary offerings as well as cremated bone, with tombs whose urn-contents had all been scattered during disturbance. Out of some 82 pins and fragments of pins found, 22 (nearly 27%) came from Ts. 107 and 285, where a significant number of urns were found undisturbed. Despite this admittedly very discouraging factor in the study of the bronzes, what has survived has been carefully scrutinized in the attempt to recover as much information as possible. Unfortunately, there is no reason to suppose that each tomb suffered bronze loss at a constant ratio to its original total contents. Some attempt has been made at establishing a hierarchy of tombs based on certain combinations of categories of bronze object. This 'hierarchy' has been compared with that demonstrated in ch. 12 by A. M. Snodgrass in the light of his study of the iron objects. The Repertory of Bronze Objects The great majority of identifiable objects is accounted for by ornaments (pins, rings and fibulae) and vessels, at least eight varieties of which have been recognised. There is a rather ill-defined series of 'Facings and Fittings', descriptions which, here, usually signal a failure of identification. There is a small, heterogeneous collection of 'exceptional' objects, which include a statuette, horse-harness and a spearhead. There are numerous component parts of larger items, otherwise vanished, including pieces of binding strip, rivets for securing handles to the objects to which they were fitted, patches tinkered to damaged vessels. In addition, there is a large category of fragmentary sheet bronze, as well as lumps and pellets, the two latter no doubt collected from the pyre after the cremation. This very summary account may be expanded into the tables 12-14. Note there is a skewing effect in the figures: the first four columns are based on both Teke and Medical Faculty tombs. The last column, showing the proportion each category represents by weight, is based only on the Medical Faculty tombs. Table 12. Total bronzes by count and by weight.

The absolute preeminence of T. 219 is inescapable. Fibulae 45 complete or fragmentary fibulae were found in 19 tombs. Seven of these (24.fi; 48. £9; 75. £29 and 31; 292^3; 294^5 and ?l6i) consist merely of spring or pin fragments, and are unclassifiable. Seventeen distinct brooch types are represented among the remaining 37 examples, a surprisingly large number, especially when viewed against the far more limited range of dress pins.</page><page sequence="266">THE DARK AGE AND LATER BRONZES 55I A separate study of Cretan fibulae has yet to be written, though there is much of value in Blinkenberg's pioneer work,1106 and E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki included an important account of Cretan material in her analysis of Island fibulae.1107 The numeration of types which follows is not intended as a Knossian typology, or anything of the kind; it is merely a convenient form of arranging the material. It does not necessarily have any chronological validity, though it starts with the earliest forms. 1. Simple arch-bow fibulae (126.£9; 25.fl3, fr.) This corresponds to B(linkenberg) II. 3, an example of which was found at Kavousi. Arch-bow fibulae, which vary a good deal in size, and somewhat in use of metal of round or rhomboid (as here) section, and in choice of plain or twisted bows, are typical of SM/SMyc, and EPG. For their early history, see supra on the fibulae from the SM T. 121. For their later development, see my comments on the Lefkandi material.1108 A fibula of this type, with twisted bow, was found in the PG tomb F.IX.1109 Here, T. 25 dates from SM; T 126 is apparently LG/EO. The presence of this type of fibula suggests that an earlier burial may otherwise have escaped notice. 2. Asymmetric arch-bow (45. f4) (B's 'Fibules haut par devant' and 'Le profil de l'arc est concave'). B 1. 10-12, especially I.i2a ('Kydonia') which has the same unusual feature of a complete turn in the wire of the bow before the start of the (missing) forearm. This is Sapouna-Sakellaraki's Type Ig. Other examples lack the coil at the angle.1110 T. 45 was in use by LPG. 3. Arched fibula with mouldings either end of its asymmetric, swollen bow (D.f4) This is close to B II. 19, several of the known examples of which have been found at Vrokastro. The type is close to fibulae from LPG contexts at Lefkandi. nu 4. Small asymmetric arched fibula, with much swollen bow (48.Í15, incomplete) This seems to be an example of a fibula type very popular in Rhodes, at Lindos, corresponding to B IVßa = Sapouna-Sakellaraki IVd. B. refers to similar brooches found on Aegina and at Ephesos. The context of ours is LPG-EO. 5. Similar fibulae, with high, narrow catch-plate and disc-finial on the bow (78.Í7; 78.Í12; 123.Í11; 292.fl 6) Apparently close to B IV4, examples of which are cited from Paros and Rhodes. Sapouna- Sakellaraki Type Vila.1112 The context of the two in the closed pithos burial group 78 should be no earlier than EO. 6. Small asymmetric bow with large spherical boss, surmounted by afinial (48.f2 + 5; 48.P6) The latter has traced chevrons on the spring-arm. High narrow catch-plate.

As the last, without finial (4O.fl6) This corresponds to B IV. i o = Sapouna-Sakellaraki Va. Blinkenberg suggested that this form developed from the preceding, perhaps on the coast of W. Asia Minor. Numerous examples were found at Ephesos, and at Lindos on Rhodes. Our fibula was associated with the LG-O reuse of the tomb. 8. The bow is composed of four spherical bosses (104. fl; 1O4.£6) This is B III. io and n = Sapouna-Sakellaraki Illb. Short spring-arm and forearm. The number of bosses varies 3-7 in B III. 10 fibulae. While many are cited from Rhodes, the distribution includes Boeotia, Delphi, Aegina, Paros and Ephesos. Several have been found in Crete, including Vrokastro and Epano Zakro. At Knossos, two came from F. T.II,1114 and were dated LPG by Brock. Two more were found in the dromos of the Teke tholos, apparently of LG or EO date, c. 700 BC.1115 9. Arch-bow fibula, with large central boss, one or two pairs of collars either side; high, narrow catch-plate (78.Í16; 107.Í19; 292.fl6a; ?40.fl6b; 107,£20; 292-fôl) These are examples of B IV. 11 = Sapouna-Sakellaraki Hie. The type is common in Rhodes, and has been reported from Aegina, Paros, and Chios. On the mainland, examples are known from Olympia and Tegea. A small version comes from the Idaean Cave.1116 Ours are probably all of EO date. Two fragments - iO7.f55 and 56 - are high, narrow catch-plates which could have been part of fibulae similar to Sapouna-Sakellaraki IV, VII or IX. 10. Fibulae with relatively large, square catch-plates, with a bow amygdaloid in plan at its centre, which varies considerably in degrees of solidity (48.£3 + 7; 78.fl8 + 25+27; 292.f33a; 107.Í12, fr.; 175.fl, fr.) This is probably a rather heterogeneous collection. Its distinguishing features are matched by B VIII fibulae (Types attico-béotiens'); 78.fi8 + 25 + 27 can also be compared with Sapouna-Sakellaraki IVd. Blinkenberg1117 refers to a fibula from Kavousi which he regarded as a possible imitation of his Type VIII, and it is perhaps in this light that we should see all this grouping from the N Cemetery. 11. Attico-Boeotian fibulae, the elongated ellipsoid bows decorated in relief '(75.fl 6 and 16a; 292. f41) Unfortunately all these are very fragmentary. As B VIIL4-6. Two fragmentary fibulae from F.

Though this very distinctive brooch type is not uncommon in Aegean Greece, its richer representation is in N Greece. 114 examples, in a wide range of sizes, were reported by M. Andronikos from the tumulus cemetery at Vergina,1119 where he reluctantly concedes that, at Vergina at least, they were in use for too long without any appreciable change in form or technique for them to be of any independent chronological value. Their wide distribution beyond Greece was emphasised several years ago by Alexander.1120 At Knossos one was found in an MG urn in the PGB-LG F. tomb X.1121 The contexts in which our three were found range from PGB to EO. 14. Ivory-and-bronze spectacle fibula (285 ,£22) This is B XV. 1. The evidence for deriving these handsome fibulae from all-metal spectacle fibulae like group 13 above is summarised by Blinkenberg1122 and need not be repeated. The form is widely distributed in mainland Greece and the islands, and has been found in Asia Minor (Ephesos and Old Smyrna), as well as Sicily and N Africa.1123 A series of some sixty examples from the Heraion at Perachora has been published by J. Stubbings,1124 with a list supplementing Blinkenberg. Three from the Dictaean Cave may be noted. The sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta was also very rich in such fibulae.1125 Our example was found in an EO urn. 15.

Fibulae Groups 285 14 292 5, 9, 10, 11, 13 and unidentified 294 Unidentified 306 13 D 3 Fibulae have a surprisingly uneven history in the cemetery, and they cannot have been standard offerings. They occur in only two out of forty intact urns, and in each case are of unusual type for the site (Group 12 in T. 218, Group 14 in T. 285). By contrast, seven out of forty urns contained pins. That the assemblage consists of a small number of examples of a wide range of types suggests that few, if any, of our brooches were locally made (again, the position is quite different in the case of pins, where numerous examples occur of very few types, probably all local). Though there are other Cretan examples of most of the Groups 1-15, there is no fibula (apart from Group 12) for which there are not abundant parallels outside Crete, particularly on Rhodes and in Asia Minor. The majority of fibulae appear to date in the LG-EO stage in the use of the cemetery, even though they were in use more or less throughout its history. This matches the evidence for fibula use in the Fortetsa Cemetery. Pins The majority of pins used in the cemetery were very small and fragile, and there must have been a very much larger number than the 82 complete and fragmentary examples reported here. As many as 43 of these 82 (52.4%) lacked the diagnostic features by which their type could have been identified, and are therefore not included in this account. These are 25.fi&gt;; 34.^62; 45-f2; 56.fii, 71-2; 57-f44; 75-f*5&gt; 66; 78-f7; 86.f3; 100^40; 107^3, 10, 39, 44, 66, 70; i59.f3; 213.fi; 218^29; 219^13, 149, 153; 283^13; 285^7; 292.fi, 8, 9a, 39, 40, 60, 62, 81; 306. f5; N.fia, 9, 10a; O.Í2; Q*f4, 6, 20?. At the time of writing, Dr. Lucia Vagnetti has a major study of Cretan pins close to publication.1126 I have benefitted from discussing the N Cemetery pins with her, and she has very generously allowed me to make use of certain aspects of her classification in what follows. I am, of course, responsible for any misidentifications or misunderstandings of her taxonomy. Here, the pins are arranged in a numbered series of groups according to type. This is for convenience only, and is not in itself any kind of classification. 1. Pin without distinct head, elliptical swelling on upper shaft, round in section (26.0) This is Vagnetti Type XIVA, other examples of which have been found at Knossos (Ay. Ioannis), Karphi, Vrokastro and Arkades. All these are larger than our pin, - in some cases, double the size.1127 Though this is essentially a SM pin-type, Vagnetti shows it continued in use into PG, given that the Arkades cemetery only came into use at an advanced stage of PG.1128 The SM/EPG context of our pin is ambivalent as to its close chronology. 1 126 To be published as a PBF fascicle. 1127 For Ay.

Pins with small cnaiV head and globular swelling on the shaft close below the head (219. fi8; 283. f7; 285.f5, 8, 36, 37; 292^38; Q.fn, 14, 37.) These are examples of Vagnetti's Type XVII. She has further divided the material into seven sub-types, according to differences in the nail-head, and in the treatment of the globe. 205. f8; Q*fii, 14, 22 are close to her sub-type C ('Capocchia a globetto con elemento ingrossato sul collo di forma globulare'). 218. fi8; 285. £36-37 accord with her sub-type D ('Capocchia a dischetto....5), while the tiny pins 283.f7; 292. ¿38 are akin to her sub-type E ('Capocchia conica e globetto biconico sul collo sottolineato da costulature'). Gold, silver and iron examples of the generic type are not uncommon. Pins of sub-types D and E have been found at Knossos, either in the Fortetsa Cemetery or the Teke tholos.1129 Vagnetti states that Type XVII pins were in long use, from PG to EO, with the greater concentration in the earlier part of this period. The N Cemetery evidence is not particularly helpful chronologically. 283^7 comes from a PGB group. 285. £36 and 37 were found in a M/LPG urn. The three examples in T.Q, are from an LG/EO context. The rest are from groups with the broad range MPG-LO, and contribute nothing to the finer chronology that Vagnetti would like to construct. 3. Pin with head of uncertain type, two small superimposed biconical bosses above a succession of fine ring mouldings (25. flO) The tomb was in use during SM/EPG; the pin probably belonged to the latter period. 4. Orientalizing pin with facetted boss (1O4.£3) The neat disc-head has an elegant biconical finial, the boss has four ring mouldings above and below, and is one of the most beautifully made objects recovered from the entire cemetery. The state of the patina suggests the pin was very highly burnished. In Crete, at least, pins of this size and quality are more common in precious metal including silver examples from the N Cemetery,1130 a pair, also silver, from the LG-LO tomb on lower Gypsades1131 and two of electrum from Fortetsa.1132 The context of our pin is LG-O. 5. Orientalizing pin with disc-head and finial, biconical or oval boss, with three or more mouldings either side (56.Í50; 75.Í19, 30; 78.f6; 107.f8, 41-42; 159.fl, 2; 285.f6, 13, 14; 292-f4, 22, 29, 82.) Probably also of this type are the damaged pins 107^40 (from an LG/EO urn) and the tiny pin 285.^65 (from an Ó urn). I am less sure whether the damaged pins 34*fôi and 292. fi8 are of this type. Both have multiple ring mouldings on what remains of their shafts. T 34 dates LG-O, 292 PGB-EO. Though few of these pins were found complete, so that the sample from which generalization can be made is small, they seem to vary in size from small (8.0 cm long) to very small (less than 5.0 cm). In our cemetery it seems probable that they were all originally placed in cremation urns. That none is fire-distorted suggests that they were not used to deck the corpse at the time of cremation but that, instead, they might have been used to secure the cloth wrapped bundles of cremated bone before they were placed in the urns. Several were found in urns - 75*fig; 107. £41,42 (O urns); 1129 E.g.

The tomb is dated LPG-LO by Brock. Another pair in silver, from the Teke tholos, has been updated PGB - BSA 62 (1967) 57ft0. I am not sure that so high a date is justified.</page><page sequence="271">556 H. W. CATLING 159.fi, 2 (LG/O urn); 285*fi3, 14 (O urn). The contexts of the remainder are less precise, but all include O material. The type is more common in the N Cemetery than elsewhere at Knossos. Others from the Knossos area include one from the Demeter sanctuary1133 and, probably, the Teke tomb.1134 Further afield there are examples from Vrokastro1135 Bone enclosure I, a seventh-century burial at Arkades1136 and the Dictaean Cave.1137 A pin found with seventh- century pottery in Schiffs grave on Thera is related.1138 6. Small pin with large mushroom head, plain slender shaft (283. £37) It is uncertain whether this piece is correctly identified as a pin. The context is PGB. I have classed as a pin the small shaft with flattened, folded head, 56. £53, conceivably modelled on the very long-lived pins with rolled or folded flattened heads which, in Crete, compose Vagnetti's pin Type VII, whose date range covers the long period MM-O. Perhaps also a pin is the 'nail-head' 285. £76, what remains of its shaft covered in fine mouldings. It was found inside a PG vessel. Rings Only one among the small collection of rings is certainly a finger-ring. The others are too unspecific in design to identify their use. The series of broad plain or ridged rings typical of PG and G contexts elsewhere in Greece is missing.1139 1. Shield Ring {26.ÎI) This piece is too badly preserved to determine whether it was decorated en pointillé as are a number of shield rings. This is a characteristic SMyc. object, at least nine examples of which were found in the Kerameikos cemetery, distributed throughout the chronological succession of those tombs.1140 Another was found in SMyc. Lefkandi tomb, Skoubris 38.10.1141 The ring may well have belonged to the SM, rather than the EPG use of T 26. 2. ?Ring with spiral terminals (292.fl6c) If this is a correct identification, only one of the two spiral terminals, and none of the hoop survives. This ring has a long DA history; examples have frequently been found in sanctuary deposits, as well as in graves.1142 As the identification is uncertain, detailed comment is inappropriate. T. 292 was in long use. 5. Plain hoop, closed (26.fi) With a diameter of 2.0 cm, this could well have been used as a finger-ring.

Plain hoops, open-ended (219. £21; 285.Í23) The former had pointed terminals, and could have been used as an earring. The latter had a second ring of very thin strip threaded onto it. The contexts are broad, from PG-O. 5. Fragments of plain hoops (48.fl8; 56.f49; 175.£6, 22) The rings of which these fragments had formed part varied somewhat in diameter, and in section (round, rectangular, flattened rhomboid). The range of contexts is wide: LPG-O. A small, plain ring with closed hoop (D.i. 6 cm), T.56.Í54, is of plano-convex section. The material is silver. The tomb was in use until O. Bracelet (75.f32) The identification is not secure, and is additionally suspect in the absence of other bracelets from the cemetery. The lack of ornament does not help the identification. But the object is complete in itself, and could so have been used. Several bracelets were found in MPG-SPG III groups at Lefkandi.1143 Spiral Wire Beads (100. f32; 285. f68) The former is only half the size of the latter; it is not certain they are identical objects. Both could be described as beads. This identification is strengthened for 285.^68 as it was found with the contents of a M/LPG urn, reinforcing a personal use. Perhaps this piece should be compared with the spiral ornaments associated with the Macedonian EIA, large numbers of which were, for example, found in the Vergina tumuli.1144 Tweezers Two main varieties are represented among the seven examples, of which the first is dominant. 1. With ogival spring and shoulders, blades flaring to broad gripping edges (45. £9 fr.; 107.Í24 fr.; f50 fr.; £67 fr.; 218.Í5; 292.f48 + 49 + 59) Where well enough preserved to determine, there is some, insignificant, variation in the width at the top of the spring. The tweezers are quite small - the best preserved (218. £5) only 6.3 cm long. Blade widths vary from 1.9-2.7 cm Small objects such as these, probably all originally deposited inside cremation urns at the time of burial, were particularly vulnerable to damage on the emptying of urns containing them. They are not immediately recognizable in small fragments. Two similar pairs of tweezers are reported from EO urns in the Atsalenio (Knossos) tomb.1145 Tweezers seem to have been common in the Dictaean Cave.1146 1143 Lefiandi I, 247 and pl. 24ig-j. 1144 Vergina I, 225-7 with fier. 66; pl. 126. 1145 BSA 63 (1968), pl. 31b, A.Br. 1-2. 1146 CCO 31 and fig. 12-eight examples in Oxford and fragments of 34 more.

With 'pinched', round spring and incurving tips to the gripping edges (2 85. £14) Tweezers close to this in form are known in Cyprus in the LBA;1147 there is unlikely to be any connection. This example was found in an O urn, and was the only pair of tweezers from the site to come from a closed context. Others come from tombs in long use, with a bracket of at least PGB-O. See also supra p.528, on a SM tweezer fragment. 292. Í43 is a pair of iron tweezers, with the remains of a bronze suspension ring threaded through the eyelet formed by the top of the spring. Phalaron (219.H12) (fig. 168) For a generad discussion of the earlier history of these controversial objects, see supra pp. 522-4 on the SM examples i86.ft&gt; and 201. fi6, with references, particularly to Fellmann's study of the Olympia material, and his insistence upon identification as belt-fittings. The T. 219 phalaron was poorly preserved, but clearly was of the type without finial. Because of the damage to die omphalos, it is uncertain whether or not there was a central securing hole. There is no sign of decoration. The find-circumstances offer little help in identifying the function of this particular phalaron. It was found on the floor of the tomb and presumably belonged to its earliest, EPG, use. It was in the same horizon as the horse-bits (q.v.), recalling N. V. Sekunda's suggestion for the way in which a small phalaron might have been incorporated into the trappings for a bridle.1148 T. 219, equally, had a rich collection of iron weapons, among which the trim of a shield would be in place - as, indeed, would a belt-fitting. There are parallels for single finds of small phalara, including one from the floor of a DA house at Nichoria.1149 Wheel-shaped Affixes (285. fl7) (fig. 169) The class of objects to which these two ornaments belong has been discussed by I. Kilian- Dirlmeier,1150 who defined five different varieties, of which ours is her 'vierspeichige Radenhänger mit dreieckigen Speichenöffhungen'. That the openings that form the spokes should be triangular is explained by an examination of the technique of manufacture - the holes were not included in the original casting, but were cut out by hand in the most economical fashion possible - three chisel-cuts for each one, which automatically produces the distinctive triangular opening. Kilian-Dirlmeier lists a number of examples from several widely separated Greek sites, including Vergina, Olympia, Thermon, Pherai, Ithaca and 'Chalkidiki'. The Vergina example comes from a ninth-century BC context. The stitch-holes on ours suggest these were used as affixes, not as pendants. They are unlikely to have been made on Crete. The context is a long-lived tomb, PGB-O. Animal Statuette (229. f2) (fig. 162; plate 273) This rather roughly modelled little figure of a horned animal was found in a cremation urn (229.6) in this tomb, recalling the circumstances of discovery of the bronze statuette of a ram 1147 CBMW 227-9. 1148 'A Bronze Horse-Frontlet from Vrokastro' in BSA 77 (1982), 251-3. 1149 Nichoria III, 280-81, with references. 1150 Anhänger in Griechenland von der mykenischen bis zur spätgeometrischen £«'¿ (= PBF XI.2, Munich, 1979) 23-5, pls. 4-8, nos. 56-120.</page><page sequence="274">THE DARK AGE AND LATER BRONZES 559 in the EO urn F. no. 895 in T. P2.1151 The figure itself presents a problem of identity. The corrugation of the horn could be interpreted to represent the tines on the horns of a deer, of some breed or other, but they might equally be intended for the projections that distinguish the scimitar horns of the Agrimi, the Cretan wild goat. There is also a problem of function, both in this case and the case of the Fortetsa ram. I have not found a convincing parallel for the figure. If it is a stag, it is unlike the few figures of stags published by W. D. Heilmeyer from Olympia.1152 Figures of stags seem always to have been much less common than bulls; doubtless their symbolism was different. Such an animal, it will be recalled, appears, hunted, on the PG pictorial crater F 1. Perhaps interest in the hunting field motivated both versions of the stag. Pot 229.6 is a LG/EO urn. The Vessels Nowhere are the losses sustained through the vicissitudes in the Cemetery's history more apparent than in the study of the ruin of the many vessels that the tombs once contained. Well over one hundred bronze vessels were identified, in whole or part, but of these, less than 4% comprise complete vessels. The very large quantities of body fragment of vessels suggests the total must have been very much larger. Vessels were found in 22 tombs. In eleven of these, there were vessels of two or more forms; the largest number of identifiable forms (five) came from T. 100. Only four forms were reported from the prodigal T. 219, but there may have been more than 25 individual bronze vessels in that tomb. The Fortetsa cemetery was less rich in bronze vessels, which were recorded in Ts. II, VI, X, XI, and P. The last was exceptionally rich in bronze in general, vessels in particular, of which eight distinct forms were found, much richer in diversity of forms than any of the N Cemetery tombs. Though no N Cemetery bronze vessel was actually found in use as an ash urn, it seems likely that some, at least, of the dinoi and craters were so used. This is reinforced by the numerous fragments of large vessels preserving textile remains, likely to have belonged to the cloth receptacles used as containers for the ashes before consigning them to their urns. Other bronze vessels evidently served as ordinary grave goods, though some of the hemispherical bowls could have been used as covers for ash urns, either metal or pottery. This custom has been noted in the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens, and in Eleusis.1153 Such bowls found at other sites, such as Argos, seem certainly not to have been used like this.1154 In what follows, the material is described according to shape, where that can be determined with reasonable certainty. Unattributable fragments - rims, handles, decorated scraps of vessel wall - are then reviewed, and the account concludes with a description of accessories found loose, chiefly tinkered patches and the rivets by which handles were secured. It is noticeable (and has been noticed in other groups of similar material) that several of the larger vessels had been damaged and repaired by sealing cracks or holes by riveting a patch, sometimes round, sometimes rectangular, over the offending crack or hole. It should not necessarily be assumed that old and/or damaged vessels were routinely set aside for funerary use. It is very likely that such large hammered vessels with very thin walls gave trouble of this 1151 E pl. 58, no. 925. 1152 Frühe olympische Bronzefiguren: die Tiervotive = 01. Forsch.

All very fragmentary (1OO.£33, 37; 107.Í63, 72; 219.f66a, 69, 74a, 88a, 96, 100a-c, 105c, 119, 142, 144, 146, 147, 150, 151; 283.f29, 38, 76, 80) The material was so comminuted that it has not been possible to estimate the dimensions of a complete specimen, though it is clear that the cauldrons were large and heavy. Nor has it been possible, within the four tombs containing fragments, to decide how many cauldrons were present in each case. Given the general conditions described at the beginning of this section, there is no way of deciding whether the sixteen pieces found in T. 219 came from one, two or many cauldrons. Oxidisation alters individual fragments in different ways, so that disparate appearance of rim forms is no more an assurance of different vessels than close similarity guarantees that particular fragments come from one and the same vessel. So far as can be determined, the cauldrons were made in a single piece and will have been raised from a plain disc-casting, whose original thickness is quite likely to have been the present thickness of the rim. They are without handles. Because of the distortion shared by all of the fragments, to a greater or lesser extent, it has not been possible to determine their profiles, let alone decide whether there was variation of profile from one example to another. They could have been more or less hemispherical, comparable to the complete example from Tylissos, used as a cremation urn and associated with a SM/PG stirrup jar. This was published by Marinatos.1157 This piece was 62.0 cm in diameter, 27.0 cm high and weighed 4.5 kilos, thus more than 25% of the total weight of metal recovered from the whole of the N Cemetery. Perhaps closer in date to our cauldrons are the more straight-sided, flatter based examples from the West Gate Cemetery at Eretria,1158 which Bérard is inclined to date c.720 BC. He seems to suggest that some of the Eretria pieces of this type could be of oriental fabric. It is also possible that the F. 'dinoi' nos. 579 (TX), 932 and 960 (TU), MG and LO in date, correspond to ours. Their bases are rounded, and the sides curve inward to the rim. Our cauldrons were found in tombs which are exceptional in other ways, as this report will repeatedly have made clear. It seems likely, though incapable of proof, that they were used as ash containers, thereby adding to their unusual character. It is particularly unfortunate that no close date can be given to this scattered material. The use of the tombs between them covers the period PGB-EO. The Tylissos and Eretria finds between them make clear that this general type of cauldron was in long use, from the late eleventh century BC until the late eighth, at the most conservative estimate. In fact, this is a vessel type which in essentials traces its pedigree to the giant cauldrons of LM I/LH I, already referred to supra, scaled down versions of which subsequently reappeared as the round bodied tripod-cauldrons of LM III/LH III which, with minor modifications, are still in use in PG, and must be related in some way to the great series of G tripod cauldrons.1 159 1155 Matthäus 1980, pls. 1.1, 4; 2.6, 8, 9; 4.27; 22.192; 23.196; 26.218, 220; 28.224.

Dinos (285.Í26) (fig. 170; plate 285) Though this vessel was found very badly crushed, it remained more or less in one piece, so that the drawing (FIG. 170) is reasonably accurate. It had been in sufficiently poor state during its life to require numerous patches to seal cracks or holes, some round, some rectangular. The walls were extremely thin (less than 0.1 cm) so the damaged state is hardly surprising. Similar dinoi were reported by Levi from Arkades.1160 Bérard published a very similar vessel from the West Gate cemetery at Eretria,1161 dating it c. 725 BC, and alluding to others from the Kerameikos at Athens, one of which is datable to c. 750-735. 1162 He refers to the Arkades dinoi, and others from Gela; he regards it as a relatively rare vessel form. Such dinoi, however, are also well known in Cyprus, as Matthäus has demonstrated1163 with his list of nine examples, none of which, unfortunately, has a close context. These include two from Marion (recent finds), one from Salamis (known only from a sketch published by Alessandro di Cesnola), three from Tamassos (Graves XI and XII) and three without provenance other than 'Cyprus'.1164 There is a tenth example from Cyprus, without close provenance, in Oxford.1165 Matthäus suggests that the series in Cyprus covers the period CG III-CC, though the evidence is less than convincing. 3. Cauldron, or large bowl, with lotus-bud handle (219.Ü85, 93, 97) (fig. 166; plate 283) The fragments are restricted to a complete handle, and parts of handles. They may represent at least two vessels. The handle escutcheon is an attenuated figure-of-eight, to the centre of each circlet of which is attached one end of the upturned horizontal loop handle from the centre of which rises, as a finial, '...a calyx of two sepals with a bud in the middle' (Jacobsthal). A curious feature is the 'strut' of twisted metal, an integral part of each side of the escutcheon, which rises from it to meet the inside of the handle loop more or less at the mid-point between bud and attachment. On 219. £85 there are three large mushroom-headed rivets on each side of the escutcheon, by which this heavy handle was secured to the wall of its vase. 219. £93 should belong to a different vessel, since there is no twisted strut, and only a single attachment rivet in the surviving circlet. The type of vessel to which these handles belonged is likely to have been a round-based basin, or cauldron, not unlike the cauldrons of group 1 above. This handle type has a long history, a wide distribution and considerable variety in detail, whether of the finial (anthropomorphic on Chios,1166 caprine in Cyprus1167), presence or absence of the twisted struts,1168 and the treatment of the escutcheon. This usually is plain, as here, but sometimes incorporating low relief rosettes1169 or other designs.1170 There is also considerable difference in size among those vessels completely preserved. Some of the smaller examples have only one handle.1171 Our vessels, assuming they were in proportion to the size of their handles, must have been as large as, if not larger than Kouklia Skales T. 49.1. 1172 1160 Arkades 149, fig. 149, pithos 77, D.37.6, H.26; p. 343, fig. 445, D.40.7, H.25.0; 473, fig. 590a, 590b; p. 475 and fig. 590c refers to the occurrence of patches. 1161 Bérard où. cit.

W. CATLING Though these are the first examples reported from Knossos, others have been recorded in Crete, including Arkades1173 and the Kavousi tholos tomb.1174 It is a nice question, in view of the caprine finíais of Skales T. 49.1, whether the well-known Mouliana bronze handles,1175 for all their different method of attachment to their vessel wall, should be seen as a formative element in the development of this series. Matthäus1176 has discussed vessels with this type of handle in the light of eleven examples found in Cyprus, two at Amathus, two at Kouklia, the rest without provenance. The datable Cypriot examples all seem relatively early in CG.1177 Chavane1178 suggests that the handle type should be traced to the merrythought handles of the Cypriot BA, and mentions the proposal that the silver, gold and niello bowl found at Enkomi, with merrythought handle, is itself of Cypriot manufacture. This seems unlikely, but the possibility should not wholly be dismissed until the subject has been more rigorously re-examined. He argues, quite reasonably, from the chronology of the EIA appearances of the handle form in Cyprus as compared with its wider distribution east and west of the island, that the lotus-bud finial version is a Cypriot development.1179 Beyond Cyprus and Crete, these handles have quite a wide currency, including Nimrud (ivory) and Gordion,1180 Delphi, Olympia, Ithaka (Polis) and Chios,1181 and further afield in Italy, where the design seems to have been adopted - and adapted - by Etruscan metal-workers.1182 4. Cauldron Handle Fittings (75.156; 219. fBO (figs. 159, 168; plates 271, 282) These two items probably belong to cauldrons of a type otherwise unrepresented in the cemetery. The former is a very solid ring-handle escutcheon almost certainly designed for use with a drop- ring handle of the type represented by the very solid open ring of the latter. The latter probably belonged to a larger vessel than the former. Handles of this type are seen on oriental cauldrons of the Altin Tepe type.1 183 A set of such handles on a cauldron could have been used to suspend it by chains over a fire. These pieces, which come from exceptional tombs, cannot be closely dated. 5. Vessels with Bolster Handles 219.Í118; G.£B) (FIGS. 168, 156; plates 282, 268) The latter is a pair of complete bolster attachments, each incorporating a pair of ring seatings for swing handles, now lost. Formless fragments survived of very thin sheet metal from the vessel's walls. 2ig.fn8 is the stub end only of a bolster, and it is uncertain whether it belonged to a vessel of the same form as G.f6. The attachments are very close to those seen on a pan from the Idaean Cave, published by Halbherr and Orsi.1184 Other handles of the same type are known from Lindos,1185 the Argive Heraion1186 and Delphi.1187 Much earlier must be the handles on a wine-filter from Cyprus, Kaloriziki T. 40, to which Matthäus has called attention.1188 T.

Shallow Pan (Q.fl9) (fig. 156) This is rather a featureless form which would be equally at home in the LBA as in the LG/EO context in which it was found.1189 It recalls Chavane's no.35 in Nicosia1190 which he relates to two similar vases of which each has a ring handle.1191 The date of these Cypriot pieces is not clear. 7. Hemispherical Bowls- complete or restorable (100. £35-37; 207.Í6; 285. £59; G.G, 3) Of these, only 207 .fB was found complete. Enough survives of the remainder to be sure of their diameters. These all appear to be hemispherical bowls without handles. 207. fl6 and G.f3 each has a small string-hole pierced below the rim, which could have been used to secure them when used as a cover, or simply for hanging when not in use. The bowls vary in diameter from 12.0-20.0, with 16.0 being the most frequent size. The three whose heights are known vary from 4.8-6.5. All will have been raised from disc-castings. Lips vary somewhat, from quite plain (100. £35) to stilted (G.fia). Similar bowls- fragments, not restorable (34. £27; 56.f65; 59.£5; 75. £168; 285. f78; G.£7, 10; N.flO) These fragments have no features not already noted on the better preserved material described above. None of the material is from an undisturbed context, and most of the tombs concerned were in long use. Such bowls are known from the LBA onwards; they, or their close kin, were very common in Cyprus in the LC period.1192 Reference has already been made to the occasional use of such bowls as lids for cremation urns {supra p. 559), and to the possibility that some, at least, of the N Cemetery bowls were so used. The single hemispherical bowl from Lefkandi Toumba 33.16 is more likely to have been part of a wine service1193 and the same is probably true of some of our bowls. Note, for instance, that there were two bowls in T. G and one in T.ioo in both of which was a lotus- handled jug, which would have provided the other part of the service.1194 8. Bowl with folded rim (292.F77) (plate 286) This fragment is not certainly a hemispherical bowl. The rim form separates it from the bowls described under 7 above. Not enough is preserved to restore the diameter. T. 292 was long- lived; PGB-EO. 9.

Note, however, that the published illustration of Skales T.74.33 does not support that particular identification 1195 See p. 30.</page><page sequence="279">564 H. W. CATLING traced chevrons above scribble (in the inscribed horizon) above rilling. The walls are rather thicker than most of our hemispherical bowls of such size. The bowl might, perhaps, have been cast. It comes from an excellent closed PG context given sharp definition by its Attic imports. This is very probably an import from the Levant. It is of some interest that several among the scores of hemispherical bowls known from LBA Cyprus have impressed inscriptions a short distance below their rims, in the Cypro-Minoan script.1196 10. Phiale mesomphalos, Phoenician (G.fl) (fig. 156; PLATE 269) It is sad this vessel is such a ruin, since it is very likely to be of Phoenician manufacture. There is just enough of an omphalos to class it as a phiale mesomphalos. It was raised from a disc casting; the relatively thick lip is quite angular. The visible traced decoration is quite simple - rilling below the rim on the wall outside, a guilloche band inside below the lip, and a many- petalled rosette surrounding the omphalos. There may possibly have been figured ornament in the space between the guilloche band and the rosette, but such indications as there are seem wholly illegible. The shape as restored, and the rosette and guilloche band, recall the complete Phoenician bowl in Oxford.1197 G. Markoe has listed thirteen Phoenician bowls from Crete,1198 of which the majority comes from the Idaean Cave. T. G dates PGB-EG, but the presence of this bowl, if nothing else, suggests that use continued rather later. 11. Other Phialai Mesomphalai{56.£66; 292.Í36 + 46 + 78; G.ffi + 9) It is, again, unfortunate that all these vessels are fragmentary, making it impossible even on paper to make a full reconstruction of their profiles. The most interesting piece is the base fragment 292^36 (to which in all probability the rim-fragments £j6 and 78 belong.) The not very prominent omphalos is surrounded by two concentric raised ridges, from which the petals/tongues radiate which enhance the wall. The bowl must have been cast and finished by hammering. These features are typical of Phrygian phialai,1199 numerous examples of which were found in the tumulus graves at Gordion. The description in the Gordion publication well fits our piece:-1200 'Common to all bowls are the large central omphalos, hollow underneath, and the raised ridges, sharp or rounded in profile, and varying in number, which surround its base.' Profiles of Gordion phialai1201 show that they have a more prominent omphalos than does ours, while none of the rim profiles resembles the rim believed to belong to our phiale. Nevertheless, the concentric ridges are so distinctive a feature, that I believe 292 .£46 to be a Phrygian piece. O. W. Muscarella, in a recent paper,1202 places the floruit of Phrygian bronze- working in the period 750-700 BC, and shows that the corpus consisted primarily of omphalos 1196 E.g. BCH #3 (1959) 258-9, fig. 28. Similar post-Bronze Age custom is illustrated by a long text on a fragmentary silver bowl of unknown provenance, where the language seems to be Eteocypriot- BCH 86 (1962) 356-7, fig. 38. 1197 Oxford 1971.156.

According to Payne, in his study of the rich series of phialai found in the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora, such vessels were not actually made in Greece before the seventh century BC.1203 He contended that earlier phialai found in Greece and Etruria should certainly be Phoenician imports. The form and contexts of the phialai from Ts. 56 and G are too uncertain for much weight to be placed on them. The T. G piece was evidently decorated with tongues radiating from the omphalos.1204 The arrangement of the decoration of the T. 56 piece is irrecoverable, so small is the fragment. 12. Lotus-Handled Jugs (lOO.ßl; G.ß and, perhaps, N.flO) (figs. 156-7; plates 268-9, 271) Though the material is very fragmentary, sufficiently distinctive pieces remain for the identification of the first two to be certain, and the third quite probable. I published a complete jug of this class from Lefkandi, in the SPG III tomb, Toumba 33.15.1205 A second jug was subsequently found in Toumba 39.31, in a LPG context, and has been published by E. Touloupa.1206 The complex history of this long-lived vase type is alluded to in my discussion of the Toumba 33 piece,1207 and has been recently further elaborated by Ali Radwan,1208 Matthäus,1209 Chavane1210 and G. Falsone.1211 Not only is the history long, but the distribution is wide. Outside Egypt and the Levant, Crete now has a relatively large number of examples, and there are doubtless more fragments awaiting identification in museum reserve collections. The G.fs handle has the unusual feature of five large rivets on the inside of the mouth, only two of which actually secure the handle to the neck of the vase, the others being merely decorative. It was W. Culican who pointed out that the use of a single ornamental rivet between the two operative ones distinguished Egyptian lotus-handled jugs from Phoenician.1212 The use of three ornamental rivets is not matched by any of the Egyptian jugs illustrated by Ali Radwan.1213 In Crete, five of our jugs were already known from the early excavation of the Idaean Cave,1214 another very probably was found at Amnisos and two came from Forte tsa T. P. Our three pieces thus bring the Cretan total to eleven. There is a handle from the Athena Alea sanctuary at Tegea1215 and, on Euboea, the two Lefkandi jugs already referred to. It would probably be quite misleading to speak of a trade in these vessels, widespread though their distribution undoubtedly is. They should more reasonably be seen as personal gifts made either in Crete by visitors from the east, or to travellers to the east from Crete. They doubtless seemed both attractive and useful. It is a nice question to determine by whom the dedications were made in the Idaean Cave - local people, or foreign visitors? The jugs are certainly a symptom of the interest taken in Crete by the Levant, and vice versa, during their currency. 1203 Perachora I, 151. 1204 Resembling Perachora I, pl. 52.3. 1205 Lefiandi 1,249-50. 12Ob BSA 77 (1982) 219; 238, fig. 8 and pl. 33e. 1207 Loe. cit. 1208 A.

W. CATLING 13. Beaked Jug with bucket handle (285.Í34; G.f4) (figs. 156, 170; PLATES 269, 285) It is far from certain that the fragment G.Í4 was part of a vessel closely resembling 285. £34. They have in common the omega-shaped swinging handle and the eyelets protruding from the lips through which the handle terminals were threaded. But the neck of the fragment seems higher, and it is insufficiently preserved to decide whether there had once been a spout. 285^34 is one of the very few complete metal vases found in the cemetery, which is a fortunate chance, since the form is without parallel, and would certainly not have been deduced if only the handle had survived. It is a fine technical achievement, not least for the very skilled manner in which the integral spout was fashioned. I have been unable to trace a convincing parallel for this very distinctive vase. The fact that there is nothing like it reported from Crete does not necessarily mean it could not have been made there, but it would be natural to consider a foreign origin. From its position in T. 285, the context is unlikely to be later than MG. 14. Situiate Vessel of unknown type (219.f5) (FIG. 168; PLATE 281) As group 13 above illustrates very clearly, there is a considerable variety of vase-forms that can be fitted with situiate rather than rigid handles. No entirely convincing parallel has been found for this fragment, but the highly stylised bull's head (head, rather than bucranium) recalls two small cauldrons with bucket handles and bull's head attachments from the Great Tumulus at Gordion, datable to the last half of the eighth century BC.1216 The context of the fragment cannot be closely dated; the tomb came into use in EPG. 15. Skyphos (219.Í58; perhaps the fragments 219.Í96 and 100.Í34) (fig. 168; plate 281) 219. £58 is one of the very few complete vases from the site; from the same tomb the rim fragment Í96 is very similar to our skyphos and suggests there may have been a second example in the tomb. The T. 100 handle fragment might belong to a similar vase, but the skyphos form is not the only one to which such a horizontal loop could have been fitted. The skyphos is composite, with separately attached cone-foot and separately attached handles. The bowl (the lip of which distinguishes it from hemispherical bowls) will have been raised from a disc-casting. The cone-foot was separately cast and secured to the bottom of the bowl by a number of small rivets. The handles were fashioned from strips of rod round in section. The shape closely resembles Attic PG skyphoi, several examples of which were found in the N Cemetery.1217 It is probable that metal and pottery versions were contemporary. There is no means of proving either where this metal version was made - though, of course, Athens is a strong candidate - or whether metal copied clay, or vice versa. 16. Vessels of doubtful shape The following fragments belong to vessels whose shapes cannot be determined, but are not represented among the fifteen forms already described. (a) Cups with broad lip-ledges (82. fu; 219^17 and 117). The first seems to have been a much larger piece than the two others, both of whose diameters may be restored as 8.0 cm. 1216 R. S.

(c) Aryballos? (56.f63) This fragment seems to preserve part of the trumpet mouth and neck of a small, closed vessel. It is probably no accident that these unusual vessels came, in the main, from particularly rich tombs already credited with a wide range of bronzes, vessels among them. The tombs are all disturbed, and no chronological value can be placed on the find-spots of these objects. 17. Decorated vessels (Frs. 34.f31a, 31c; 56.£70; 219.Í23; 283.f79) In view of the richness of Fortetsa T. P in decorated bronze, including a richly ornamented Phoenician bowl, the almost complete absence of such material from the N Cemetery is both surprising and disappointing. The fragments listed above preserve tiny scraps of decoration, nearly all of it linear, all of its fragments so small that one can do no more than recognize there were at least a few decorated vessels, though none of the fragments preserve any recognizable figured ornament. None of the items comes from a close context. 18. Vessel Handles and handle fragments (a) Strap handles. (34-f34; io7.f7i; 219. £152; 294^7; G.f7) Suitable either as jug or kantharos-type handles. Most of these are plain straps with either thickened or folded edges, no doubt designed to give the handle some rigidity. Several have one or more rivet holes for attachment to the walls of their vessels; in one case (107.^1) a little rivet remains in situ. In most cases, attachment by a single rivet was enough, but 294^7 needed two. It is possible that G.f7 might have been part of a lotus-handled jug. None of these fragments can be closely dated. (b) PHorizontal loop handles. (107. £54; 306. Í22) Not enough is preserved of either of these pieces to be sure of the identifications. They could have formed parts of skyphoi as group ij above. Not closely datable. (c) Sturdy vertical handle. (i34.f2) Broad lower attachment, pierced by two rivets. Would have been suitable as an oinochoe handle, but there are other possibilities. Not before LG. (d) Solid handle plate. (283.f77,8i) These two pieces may be part of the same vessel, if not of the same handle. Each preserves the large mushroom rivet-head by which it was secured to its parent vessel. The shapes of the fragments distinguish them from the figure-of-eight escutcheons of lotus-bud handles as group 3 above, as also from the handle fragments described under group 4 above. The oval form recalls a trifle the terminals of some cauldron handles in Grave Circle A at Mycenae.1218 The context dates from PGB. (e) Roughly made horizontal loop-handle.

Tinker's patches (34.f31b, 67; 56.Í73; 219.fl01; 283.f74, 75, 78) The use of large vessels that had been damaged and repaired has already been commented on, particularly in discussing the dinos, group 2, associated with which were several patches, some round, some rectangular. Their discovery in the four tombs listed above strongly suggests these tombs contained large bronze vessels. Only in the case of T. 283 have recognizable fragments of such vessels survived. 20. Rivets (75.£38; 107.121*; 175.£21; 218.f7*,33; 219.f86b; 283.f3*,40*; 285.flO*,77*; 287.f4*; D.£2) This is a miscellany of rivets all, or nearly all of which are likely to have been parts of vessels, in nearly every case used for securing the handle(s) to the wall of the vase. The seven marked by an asterisk in the list above have marked conical or mushroom heads which, almost certainly, will have been on the inside walls of their vases. The smallest of this collection has a diameter of 0.6 cm, the largest 1.5. The probability is that they were attached to large open vessels, or the mouths of substantial closed vessels. Only in the case of T. 287 was there no other evidence for the presence of vessels in the tomb. There is no evidence for a close chronology for any of these pieces. The identity of the remaining rivets is less clear. 175. f2i and D.f2 could have come from the hafts of bronze knives or weapons, though the extreme scarcity of such objects is a counter-indication. 21. Unidentified component (100 .£39) This piece, originally thought to be part of the fragmentary rod tripod 100. £4 etc., was re- identified as part of a vessel of unknown type. It is one more reminder of the extent of the losses incurred in the metalwork in our tombs. 22. ?Foot-filling {3O.Ï7) Though complete certainty is not possible, it seems likely that this irregular disc with conical depression on one face comes from the foot of a tall vessel - stemmed cup, or narrow-sided jug with high centre of gravity - used to restore the stability of which its shape deprived it. Several rather similar objects found at Perachora were published by Payne1219 who suggested such an identity for them. The Rod Tripod (100. f4 + 8 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 30) (fig. 160, plate 271) Though much too little of this object survives to allow its height or the diameter of its ring to be calculated, it is nevertheless clear it was a relatively large stand, approaching the dimensions of the Vrokastro Karakovilia Grave I stand1220 which is the largest of the tripods so far known in Crete. Like Vrokastro, our stand had an undecorated ring. No part of the legs or feet remain, so the comparison of design with Vrokastro should not be over-emphasised. This find brings to four the number of bronze tripods and other stands found in the Knossos area. In addition to this piece and the fragments of a four-sided stand found in the SM T. 201, a similar but smaller tripod was recovered from Hogarth's Knossos Grave 31221 and another small 1219 Perachora I, 160-61. 1220 CBMW199, no. 20 and references; Matthäus 1985, 306.1. 1221 CBMW 198, no. 18, Matthäus 1985, 305^</page><page sequence="284">THE DARK AGE AND LATER BRONZES 56g tripod with relief ornament on the ring and legs in the Fortetsa Cemetery, T. XI.1222 Matthäus1223 refers to what may be a fifth stand found in the Hotel Site beyond the N Cemetery, in what appears to be a very rich tomb dug in 1982 by Y. Sakellarakis, as yet unpublished. T. 100 was in use by LPG; it is particularly unfortunate that it was so heavily pillaged that this object was nearly completely destroyed, and its context lost, for both categories of information would have contributed to the debate concerning the origin of the stands found in Crete. It is not in dispute that, in the form we have this class of metalwork, the examples from Late Bronze Age contexts (chiefly, but not exclusively, found in Cyprus) were made in Cyprus. It is also very likely that one of the main workshops was located in the great Late Cypriot town of Enkomi. Material indistinguishable from this Cypriot series has been found in the Cape Chelidonia wreck of c. 1200 BC (fragments, part of the scrap metal in the cargo) and in the Tiryns Treasure and the Anthedon Hoard, the dates of which are not particularly secure, though suggestive of the LBA rather than later. As we know, the stands also occur in contexts very much later than this. One of the best known is the tripod from an eighth century BC tomb on the Pnyx, in Athens, which in design and technique goes very closely indeed with material from contexts of the late thirteenth and early twelfth century found in Cyprus. It is accordingly usually accepted that this was an antique of some 400 years old at the time of its burial. Tripods from the Sellada cemetery on Thera1224 come from even later contexts. These Theran stands have certain design features in common with tripods found on Crete, for which close parallels have not yet been found in Cyprus. Among these are features of the lower leg, and foot. I have argued in the past (see supra, on 201. fi) for a common origin for the whole complex of bronze stands of Cypriot type, suggesting, moreover, that the life of the workshops in which they were produced was relatively brief, that they were greatly admired for their design and technology, and that they were treated as treasures and became heirlooms. The heirloom theory is never particularly attractive to scholars preoccupied with arranging material sequentially; and understandably my view, particularly of the origin of the Cretan and Theran material, has been challenged. I concede that this challenge is given force by the appearance in Italy and Sardinia of stands and related objects which, though showing the influence of their Cypriot origins, clearly stand apart from the main group and, whenever and wherever they were made, must have been made under different circumstances. The question of the identity of the Cretan tripods is not yet resolved, though I prefer the heirloom explanation to the view that these are imitations of Cypriot design and technology. But the subject certainly requires an open mind and a fresh, rigorous reappraisal of all the evidence, for which the present discussion is not the appropriate place. Postscript. I am not convinced by the suggestion that recently discovered cire perdue fragments from Palaikastro (BSA 87 (1992), fig. 25 and p. 150) might include components of these tripod stands. Horse-bits (219. f92, 102, 103a) (fig. 168; plates 282-3) It seems remarkable that these finds should be concentrated in a single tomb. fiO2 is a complete snaffle bit, composed of interlocking canons with twisted shafts and crescent-shaped cheek-pieces through the centre of which the elongated ends of the canons are threaded, each 1222 CBMW 198, no. 19.

Holes at each end of the cheek-pieces allowed the bit to be secured to the head-stall, thus forming the complete bridle. This makes a sophisticated piece of harness, a combination of considerable bronze-working expertise and great experience of horsemanship, ft 03a comprised a pair of cheek-pieces, similar to those attached to the complete bit, while £92 was a single cheek-piece of the same type. Bits have been studied by H. Donder.1225 Ours are closest to her type VI (Plattenknebel (zweiösenprinzip), Bogenform, Halbkreis) - composite bits and cresccntine cheek-pieces whose varying forms she has arranged in five different sub-types. Our bits belong to her sub-type E, both examples of which cited in her catalogue come from Crete, one from Arkades, the other from Prinias.1226 Donder, indeed, suggests this is a specifically Cretan version of a type of bit which, she thinks, was itself developed in Greece where not only does it occur in corpore in sanctuary deposits, particularly at Olympia, but also is regularly represented in Greek art, especially in Corinthian, Laconian, Attic and Chalcidian vase- painting. Our Knossos finds are one of the very few instances of the use of bits as grave offerings in Greek lands. Normally, as Donder's lists explain, bits were dedicated in sanctuaries, whether as war-spoil or thank-offerings for success on the race-track. The majority so far reported has been found at Olympia. They have also been reported as accessories to marble equestrian sculpture, notably in the case of the horses on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.1227 The Prinias cheek-piece comes from one of the remarkable series of horse-graves on the edge of the cemetery excavated by G. Rizza.1228 Unfortunately, only brief references have so far been made to this very interesting complex, but it is known that cheek-pieces were found in situ on a horse-skull in a grave containing two horses and a dog, while in pit BB found in 1972 there was a complete bit and a cheek-piece. Our horse-burials in the N Cemetery (supra pp. 8, 125, 181, 183) had no trace of harness; it is tempting to suggest that the harness from T. 219 once belonged either to this pair of horses, or to some other horse-burial complex that did not survive for us to find. The Knossos, and, even more, the Prinias finds of horses and harness suggest a fresh study of horse-and-harness-burial in Greek lands would be timely. A. M. Snodgrass has shown (infra) that iron bits had been placed in Ts. 30 and 292; only fragments survive, but the identification is sure. It seems that bits in funerary contexts are more commonly directly associated with the burials of horses themselves, as is the case at Lefkandi, Toumba1229. But it will be recalled there was an iron bit among the complex of war-gear found with an EG I cremation grave in the Athenian Agora published by C. W. Biegen.1230 The Royal Tombs at Salamis in Cyprus provide a different type of horse-burial from those at Prinias and Knossos. These were chariot or wagon teams that had participated in the funeral ceremony, to be slaughtered where they stood in the dromos of the tomb, and left lying there with their bits still in their mouths.1231 The same practice was observed at Palaepaphos, where horse skeletons were found with iron bits in situ. 1225 H.

In the case of the latter, the bits were left in the horses' mouths; in the case of the former they were retained as an intimate possession of the rider. This explanation cannot possibly be confirmed; its weakness is that there are so very few instances of the use of such horse-harness as human grave gifts. The explanation - if there is one - may be no more than the caprice of individual choice. Spearhead (292. f63). (plate 286) This is the only bronze weapon found in a context later than SM. Despite this, however, it is not a BA survivor, demonstrated particularly in the angular shoulders, which are never found in the BA material.1232 It is, in fact, a translation into bronze of the iron weapon form, spearhead or javelin, that Snodgrass elsewhere here shows was in abundant use at Knossos for three centuries. Were this piece of iron, with its length and blade width, Snodgrass might prefer to class it a javelin. T. 292 was in use from PGB-LO. Tools The few objects listed under this category are aberrant for the cemetery. There is only one specimen of each, and it remains quite uncertain whether they were intentionally placed where they were found, or were lost during some aspect of the construction, use or reuse of the tombs in which they were found. They are unhelpful chronologically. 1. Graver or tracer (86. ,fl) (FIG. 160; PLATE 271) Probably a double-edged tool, and therefore used without a haft. It came from a robbed tomb, with signs of LG/O use. 2. PSmall spatula (126.Í7) (plate 273) So bent out of shape that its form and function are very doubtful. The tomb was in use in the LG/O period. 3. PShaft fragment of similar tool (292.£37) (fig. 171) 4. Fragment - Pfrom knife with fishtail terminal (219.£143) The identification is too uncertain to warrant a discussion of such knives. Perhaps EPG. 'Weight5 (292. f2) (fig. 171; plate 286) This is an enigmatic object, consisting of a ridged semi-cylinder of lead, wrapped in very thin bronze sheet, horizontally ridged and grooved. It may well merely be a part of something larger - e.g., a vessel with walls so thin that it needed lead in its foot to ensure its stability (see, for instance, 3O.Í7, supra p. 568). Again, only the discovery of a more complete example - whatever it may be - can help to identify it. 1232 Höckmann, ÄG^A/27 (1980), 13-158.</page><page sequence="287">5y2 H. W. CATLING Unclassified component parts of more complex objects The list that follows details a number of fragments, chiefly very small, of apparently distinctive form, whose function, as parts of larger objects all the rest of which has been lost, remains unidentified.

PGB-O. 2i8.f27a. 'Hammer'-like object. The resemblance to a hammer is superficial; this clearly is not such a tool. The size and shape of what would then have to be the shaft- hole are quite unsuitable, while the apparent 'burring' on one face, and its complete absence on the other, makes further difficulty for such an identification. The circumstances of discovery (adhering to iron weapon fragments) are unilluminating. It is tempting to see it as the foot of some kind of stand, in which case the hole may have been used to attach a transom. The tomb was in use from PGB-LG. 292. f7. Lead (strip) and bronze (part sheathing). PGB-EO. 292.fi4a. Spatula, on to whose shaft are threaded two open cylinders. All bronze/copper. PGB-EO. 294.fi.

None is complete; none certainly proclaims its identity by its shape or decoration. Decoration, indeed, is very restricted; only 219^74 has repoussé ornament of any complexity, and this is abstract - or, rather, skeuomorphic, though not readily interpretable. There is nothing here to compare with the figured decoration of the Forte tsa belt and quiver.1233 The hundreds of sheet metal fragments from the site were all closely examined to ensure nothing of this kind escaped notice. The material is arbitrarily arranged in sequence of tombs. 100. f24« No stitch-holes or ornament. The lack of any finished edges makes identification impossible. In view of the comparative thickness (not less than o.i cm), this may be misplaced as a facing. No alternative explanation suggests itself. 107. £73, Two similar plates with lips on three sides, rivet holes, each decorated by matching pairs of horizontal relief ridges. These were found in fragments, scattered broadcast in the disturbed tomb- fill. It seems likely they are a pair - their shape means they were attached at the bottom of some relatively narrow object. They could have served as the chape of a sword or dirk scabbard. The tomb was in long use from PGB-EO. I75.f24. Four fragments with an edge folded at right angles; rivet holes (including one containing a tiny rivet). Undecorated. Perhaps the reinforcement for an object like a quiver or scabbard.

The arrangement of the fragments in the illustrations, both drawings and photographs, has no particular significance. The apparent shape, with what appear to be straight edges, makes it unlikely that this is a shield-facing. From the Upper Level. 2i9.fi45* (Almost small enough to have been classed as 'strip'). Two pieces secured by a surviving rivet. Part of a wrapping, or other reinforcement? From the floor of the tomb. 285. £42 + 60. These tongue-shaped objects were found, one above another, and clearly must be taken together. They have no attachment holes, and cannot have been facings in the normal sense. Their shape suggests a weapon - sword or dirk - and they could perhaps have been used as the internal reinforcement for a leather or textile scabbard. It is just possible they are objects in their own right, but, if so, it is difficult to suggest an identity. They were found lying flat in the lowest burial level; their associations are, unfortunately, of no help in identifying them. Their context is probably PG. Strip This is an unsatisfactory grouping of a difficult set of probably heterogeneous objects which have in common their constitution as flat, narrow bands of metal with straight, parallel edges, all of which, without doubt, once formed parts of more complex objects. These, in many cases, were no doubt made of perishable materials - textile, leather, wood. With one or two exceptions, the strip varies between 0.2 and 1.0 cm in width. It may be less than 0.1 cm thick. In several cases the small rivet- or stitch-holes survive by which the strip will have been attached to whatever other material the object was made of which it was part. The list that follows is arranged in ascending order of complexity which, at the end, includes specific arrangements of pieces of strip which should have been identifiable, though I have to admit failure in understanding them. 1. Small lengths of plain strip (56.Í68; 60.Í2, 8, 10; 107.f64; 146.fi, 20; 175.G3; uncatalogued pieces in T. D) 2. Lengths of strip with pin- /stitch-holes (107.f69; 175.£5) It is possible that both these could be part of one or other of the items recorded from the same tombs in group / above. 3. Length of folded strip, with tiny rivet in situ (107.Í74) (PLATE 272) Though this piece (total L.4.5 cm) was found folded in half, it need not have been so folded in use, and the fold cannot be taken as a necessary indication of identity. 4. Lengths of strip apparently having originally encircled a slim rod, or the like (285.fi5a) Some dozen fragments found together may have comprised as many as three circlets, though only one pin- /stitch-hole remained. The circlets varied from 0.3-0.4 cm width. There was no association in the tomb to make their use more intelligible. 5. 'Clip3 made of strip folded over and secured by a rivet (107.Í5) (FIG. 1 6 1 ; PLATE 272) Such a clip could have been used to secure leather stretched over a wooden or basket-woven frame, at the edges. There must originally have been several more identical clips forming part of the same object. Somewhat similar clips are familiar from Minoan sites, including the Minoan Unexplored Mansion at Knossos.1234 1234 ¿/M I, 216, pl. 205.33-5.</page><page sequence="289">574 H- w- CATLING 6". Broader strips, folded or rolled so that their overlapping ends can be secured by two or more rivets (107.Í68; 219.fl01a The overlap in the former was secured by three tiny rivets, in the latter by two. The latter seems to have been used more than once, for there are two empty pin-holes which can hardly have been in simultaneous use with the others. The latter is a good deal larger than the former, and unlikely to have been used on the same kind of object. 7. Pairs of lengths of strip attached to each other at the centre, with folded terminals (19.£2 + 3; 218.fl9) Though these two objects are of different sizes, it cannot be doubted that they were used in the same fashion. The structure in each case consisted of two narrow strips of metal of equal length, each of the four ends of which were doubled back on themselves. Each was pierced by a rivet-hole at the centre through which it was pinned to its fellow (clear in the case of 2i8.fi g). The T. 19 example was nearly twice as large (though the width of strip was the same in both cases) as the other. Both arms of the T. 19 object were bent into a relatively high 'bow', while the T. 218 piece was, as preserved, almost flat. The identity can only be surmised; perhaps this was some kind of armature for a small cloth receptacle that had to be kept semi-rigid in this ingenious way. It can only be hoped that a future discovery will be circumstantial enough to allow a closer estimate of identity. None of these objects is datable per se; nearly all come from tombs in long use, and have to be given the broad bracket PG-O. Unidentifiable A distressingly large number of fragments remain unexplained. Responsibility for this failure of identification is mine alone. The objects are as follows:- 75.f3i. Tapering strip of rectangular section. Possible type of object(s):- Tweezers, Fibula, Bracelet. PGB-O tomb. 107. f48. Fragment of disc, among contents of Pot 27-presumably from the pyre.

Snodgrass GENERAL REMARKS One of the clear features to emerge from the study of the ironwork is the hierarchy of the tombs in respect of their weaponry and funerary accoutrements - that is, of the accompaniments of their male cremations. No such hierarchy is immediately obvious in the distribution (in any case much less rich) of the grave-goods which may be assumed to have accompanied female depositions: pins, fibulae, rings and tweezers. In the list given below, only definite Early Iron Age tombs are included: the problematic cases of 'Roman' tombs which produced finds of Early Iron Age type (5, 158, 238), and of T. 247 which produced a piece of obelos from disturbed soil, are for the time being omitted. 'Funerary accoutrements' designates the enigmatic objects which have been interpreted as 'fire-baskets' and 'bier- attachments'; 'tools' included knives, axes, chisels, nails and a rasp. A: Tombs with funerary accoutrements, fire-dogs, obeloi, weapons and tools: Ts. 219 and (possibly) 285 B: Tombs with fire-dogs, obeloi, weapons and tools: Ts. 283 and (if not in A) 285 C: Tombs with obeloi, weapons and tools: Ts. 75, 100, 107, 218; the presence of tools is unproven in heavily-robbed T. 24 D: Tombs with weapons and tools: Ts. 2, 25, 48, 56, 60, 123, 175, 186, 208, 292, 306 E: Tombs with weapons only: Ts. 1, 13, 26, 28, 45, 106, 125, 134 F: Tombs with tools only: Ts. 14, 16, 18, 85, 201, 294 It will be seen that all the categories except the last two are formed merely by subtracting the first, and least common, class of object from the designation of the previous category. Only the last pair of categories breaks this sequence. It should be noted, however, that the inclusion of bronze weapons would have the effect of transferring one or more tombs in categories E or F to the 'higher' category D. Predictably, the number of tombs in each category appears to increase as one goes down the list, if E and F are taken together. This conforms to the 'pyramidal' shape which one expects of any early social hierarchy, and the picture seems duly completed when one adds, at the bottom, a further category of tombs which have produced Early Iron Age pottery but no iron grave-goods of 'male' type. These ostensibly number some fifty, and are thus more numerous than the six categories A-F taken together; they remain so even when one subtracts</page><page sequence="291">576 A. M. SNODGRASS the half-dozen tombs which have produced iron finds of 'female' type only (Ts. 40, 104, 124, 163 and 177 (all with pins), and T. 19 (bracelet), and a further group which seem not to have been independent tombs in reality ('Tombs' in, 135, 157, 293 and 310). But this apparently tidy pattern is vulnerable to the serious objection that the thorough plundering which so many of our tombs have suffered may have disturbed the data beyond recognition. In general, one can only guess at the scale of the depredation, but it was certainly large: several tombs retain traces of only a single burial, though evidently designed to hold many. Most disconcerting of all, perhaps, is the evidence for horse-burial. The slaughtering and burial of the horses which pulled the funerary hearse is a rite which is normally associated with the richest and most ceremonious funerals of the Early Iron Age. We have found no unmistakeable traces of the hearse itself in any of the tombs, but there are fragments of horse- bits which occur (in bronze) in T. 219 (Category A) and in iron in T. 292 (Category D), but also more unexpectedly in T. 30, one of those which produced no iron weapons nor even tools. Horse-bones, however, were found in Ts. 79, 152 and 168, all three of which, disconcertingly, also belong to this 'lowest' category of tombs without iron finds of any kind, as well as in T. F. This, if it is a hint of the degree of robbing to which the grave-goods have been subjected, is an immensely discouraging one. No doubt there could be other explanations of the horse- bones in terms of unknown vagaries of Cretan funerary practice, as is perhaps suggested by the burial, in T. 79, and, again, in T. F. of dogs as well. But the safest course is surely to treat the surviving ironwork as a mere remnant of what was once deposited in the cemetery, and to eschew all those negative conclusions which might be based on its absence from certain tombs or burials. There remain, however, some positive conclusions which can be salvaged from this residue. One of these is the indication of a strong hereditary element in the society that was served by this cemetery. It cannot be by the mere hazards of survival that burial with arms is so often found to be a recurrent feature, at different periods but in the same tomb. To express the point differently: the likelihood that a burial with arms will occur in the later 'life' of a given tomb is greatly increased if there has been earlier burial with arms in the tomb's history. This positive correlation can be shown in the majority of our richer tombs (Categories A-D). Thus T. 285 shows an iron dirk (£74) at the beginning of its period of use (presumably in EPG), joined by iron spears and javelins later in the PG period, and especially in PGB (fi, 3, 35), and culminating, after a break, in the extremely rich metalwork of the EO phase. Burial with arms was thus practised by the group using this tomb over a period of more than 200 years. If T. 285 gives perhaps the most striking instance, there are several parallels among the other rich tombs. Thus an iron knife of PG date, 219. £25, is a foretaste of the weaponry of G date in this tomb, again reaching a grand climax at the very end of this period. T. 107 offers a longer series, ranging from a PGB dagger, through a javelin and arrowheads at the transition to O down to a dirk, javelins and knives of the full O period, a range of at least 150 years. T 175 shows burials with arms spanning much of the PG period; Ts. 75 and 292 similarly bridge the period from MG to full O while the sequence in Ts. 218 and 306 apparently stops somewhat earlier. Conversely, one may point tentatively to the fact that, where burial with arms appears only in a single stage of the tomb's use, this is almost always in cases where only that period is represented in the surviving finds at all: in other words, these tombs either had just one period of use, or have had all traces of their use at other periods removed. This applies to the burials with arms in Ts. 2 and 186 (SM), 208 (SM/EPG), 24 (E-MPG), 100 (LPG-EG), 123 (EO) and 56 (O). There are only two apparent exceptions: T. 48, which shows signs of reuse in the O</page><page sequence="292">IRON 577 period, more than three centuries after the deposition of arms at the beginning of PG, but with no further arms; and T. 60, which conversely received one burial but without weapons, in EPG some 300 years before the date of its extant burials with arms in O times. In both these cases, the long interruption in the extant evidence may well, if it corresponds to reality, suggest a break in memory or in the hereditary use of the tomb. In the case of the very rich T. 283, finally, the chronological associations are disturbed beyond recovery, but the wealth of iron finds is so great that it is impossible to believe that they can all have derived from a single phase in its history of more than two centuries' use. To sum up: the evidence of the eighteen tombs that were richest in iron finds shows that burial with arms and other ostentatious metalwork is normally a recurrent feature among certain Knossian families, reappearing over periods that span anything from 50 to 200 years; and that it occurs as an isolated phenomenon only when either just one sequence of use of the tomb is documented, or there was an interruption in that use, so long that the tradition appears to have been broken. The same generalisation seems also to extend to the tombs of Category E, which produced a few weapons but no other iron objects. Thus, the finds from Ts. 28 and 125 are essentially one-period; Ts. 13, 25, 26 and 45 all show gaps in their extant evidence, from at least 100 (T. 13) to at least 250 (T. 45) years in length; while Ts. 1 and 106, though each shows traces of earlier use, have both been thoroughly plundered of all but their latest (O) phases of deposition. This may be a useful finding on the positive side but, as we have seen, we cannot draw the negative corollary that most other families never aspired to the practice of burial with arms. Nor can one attempt to quantify the incidence of this practice in Knossian society of this period with any safety. Other findings are altogether predictable: as, for instance, that the richest tombs generally produce the widest range of tools and weapons. Quantitatively, Ts. 219, 285, 283, 218, 175 and 292, in that order, have produced the largest numbers of iron tools and weapons; but in view of what has been said about the effects of robbing, this order may be less significant than that suggested by the range of types. Here, Ts. 75 and 218 (seven types each) come out ahead even of the huge inventories of Ts. 219, 283 and 285 (five types each, within the strict class of weapons and tools). The general belief that the tombs reflect some kind of social hierarchy among the families using them finds support in the fact that, of our eighteen richest tombs in 'male' finds, as many as thirteen also produced dress-pins, the most distinctive class of metal finds associated with female burials. But the state of the material hardly allows of any further hypotheses along these lines. It is time to turn to the individual classes of ironwork, beginning with the weapons. WEAPONS These will be considered under the headings of swords, dirks, daggers, spearheads, javelin- heads, arrowheads and bow-tips, with a sub-division of types (where appropriate) under each heading. SWORDS The true sword, a weapon of a size and weight that will enable it to be used for both cutting and thrusting strokes, was never a prominent weapon in Early Iron Age Crete. The moderate length of Cretan examples, and the general preference for the dirk, were noted more than thirty years ago (see my EGAW no) and are further demonstrated by the N Cemetery. Two types, both well-known from earlier finds, are represented here.</page><page sequence="293">578 A. M. SNODGRASS Type A Flange-hilted sword with parallel edges for most of the length of the blade; the hilt normally takes the form of three successive swellings alternating with two intervening 'necks'. The hilt normally has a tang or spur at the upper end for the attachment of the pommel (i75.fa7, 283.163), but in one case (106. £3) the hilt terminates in a 'fish-tail' shape, with the regular pair of branching 'ears' but no spur in between. The hilt-plates (traces of which survive in a few of our examples - 106. Í3 (wood), 75.fi3 + 14 + 26d + 91 (wood and horn)) were retained by means of flanges at the edges, and then secured by means of three or four rivets.

It can be readily distinguished from the sword, where the blade survives, by the steadily tapering edges and sharper point, appropriate to a stabbing weapon; where only the hilt is preserved, the generally much slimmer form usually enables the dirk to be distinguished from the sword of Type A above, whose hilt it otherwise closely copies, with flanges, swellings and rivets; the</page><page sequence="294">IRON 579 pommel-spur is an almost invariable feature. Hilt-plates of wooden (28. f6; 75.Í54, 75»f75) or, more generally, organic composition (285^35, 285^74, 285.f76) were used, and there are sometimes traces of a wooden scabbard (75^54). Dirks are here distinguished from daggers by the simple criterion of size: stabbing weapons whose hilts are exceptionally slim (that is, not normally exceeding W. 2.5) and/or exceptionally flat, and whose blades look unlikely to have exceeded 25 cm in length (none, alas, survives complete), have been classified as daggers. Among the dirks as among the swords, bronze rivets (nine cases) are commoner for the hilt than iron ones (five cases).

SPEARHEADS The main problem is the distinction, often difficult, between spears and javelins (on which see EGAW 136-9). In our case, the difficulty is eased by the exceptional conformity of type displayed by both classes of weapon. A single type dominates the 'spearheads', to the extent that very few of our (often fragmentary) pieces can be shown not to belong to it. The features of this type are: socket of moderate length and diameter, seldom exceeding L. 10 cm; very square, sometimes slightly hooked shoulders; broad blade, which usually has its greatest width not at the shoulder, but a little way down the blade; clear midrib,</page><page sequence="296">IRON 58i tapering to a sharp point some io cm down the blade; and, where preserved, considerable length. Several of these features distinguish it from the weapons here classed as 'javelins', none more so than that of a blade which actually widens for a short distance instead of tapering. Other differences can be quantified: the greatest blade-width, over twenty-six preserved examples, averages 3.4 (as against 2.75 in javelins), while complete examples range from 37.8 to 49.5 in length (the corresponding limits for javelin-heads being 25.4 and 39.8). The dominant type just described can be equated with 'Type L' in EGAW, a particularly close parallel being offered by Li from Kofina (PG). But the eighth-century pair from Fortetsa (Lg in EGAW) are smaller and have less distinct midribs, and the type as a whole was not known to be a common one; so that it is a great surprise to find it almost ubiquitous in this cemetery for some three centuries. The type remains, so far as I know, peculiar to Crete. Two examples from T. a85*f4i(i) + 53(d) + 82 and fs6(ii) + 62 + 91, show an unusually broad blade with fine midrib. Type A L.

As explained above (pp. 580-1), it is generally possible to distinguish them from spearheads by certain criteria, including that of size. Another criterion sometimes used elsewhere, that of the association of either a larger spearhead and a smaller javelin-head, or of two matching javelin-heads, with a single burial has proved unusable here, since the groupings are seldom recoverable and, in any case, 'spearheads' have proved to occur in matching pairs (cf. above 28. f7 and 8; 283. £72). The two categories must, to some extent, be seen as conventional ones; it is by no means certain that the 'spearheads' were invariably used for the thrust and the 'javelin-heads' never. One other tendency may be noted: the javelin-heads become distinctly smaller during the lifetime of the cemetery. This is perhaps a sign of increasing specialisation, with an initial dual-purpose weapon gradually developing into two distinct forms. Thus the greatest blade- width of the javelins down to the end of PGB averages about 2.9 for fifteen preserved specimens, while twenty four specimens from the beginning of Geometric onwards average only about 2.65 for this measurement. This of course makes distinctions of category progressively easier. The javelins prove somewhat less homogeneous than the spears, with two recurrent, though not very clearly distinguished, varieties emerging. The appearance of the very small variety, Type C, in the O period, coupled with the decline in numbers of the larger spearheads, suggests a general trend towards lighter weapons. Type A This is really a reduced version of the Type A spearhead, with the same features of square or hooked shoulders and a midrib tapering away to disappear in the lower part of the blade. This type of 'javelin' probably corresponds to the pair F. no. 1606 (= L3 in EGAW) mentioned above, showing that the type had already been found in two sizes.

Here should be mentioned the enigmatic iron object i.f25 of EO date, which had been designed to fit the top of a slim, tapering and slightly curving wooden object. The single- curved, composite bow is known to have been used in Crete at the time in question, and such a reinforcement for the top would be appropriate for the type (on which see EGA ^142-3). In Etruria, at a slightly later date, a similar but larger object has been identified as a probable bow-tip: see L. Pareti, La Tomba Rego lini- Galassi (1947), 266, N. 229 no. 8, ad fin (L. 10, D. internally 2.7). The curvature and small size of our object - both inappropriate for a weapon- socket - makes this interpretation seem likeliest. Tools These are, as usual in graves of the Greek Early Iron Age, much less common than weapons, and will be similarly treated under the successive headings of knives, axes, axe-adzes, chisels, nails and rasp. Miscellaneous or obscure objects not listed here will be found under the next section, 'Other Funerary Accoutrements'. ONE-EDGED KNIVES This large class of finds is heavily predominant among the tools, and outnumbered only by the javelin-heads and obeloi among the ironwork generally. Five different types, all previously attested, are detectable. Rivets in the tang (never more than two in number) are relatively rare, and mainly confined to the larger knives; on the use of bronze and iron for these rivets, see p. 581 above. Hilt-plates could be present, of wood (86.f29 6o.fi4, 75#fi8), horn (75«f9 + n(i)) or bone (75«fao). Type A The commonest variety at all periods is a straight-backed knife with a blade averaging between 1.5 and 2 cm. in width; the cutting-edge too is straight for part of its length, but develops a convex curve towards the tip. The hilt extends the line of the blade, with similar width. F. no. 161 6 is a good example of this type, but none of ours was as well- preserved; indeed, most are so fragmentary that their extant length is not a significant measurement.</page><page sequence="301">586 A.

The date there is EO. Other Funerary Accoutrements Under this heading we group the remaining objects, whether their function was primarily a part of daily life or of funerary ritual. HORSE-BITS Something has already been said (above, p. 576) about the incidence of recognisable horse- harness and horse-bones in the tombs. It is disappointing to have found so little evidence for the horse itself, and none at all of the funerary vehicle or hearse; but it should be observed that, in the better-documented case of Etruria at any rate, horses were not an indispensable adjunct of ostentatious burial and that, in particular, a form of wheeled bier existed which was evidently handled by mourners on foot (see below, under 'Bier-attachments'). Our only iron bits are of relatively late date, but bronze ones were occasionally used before this. Both our examples come from mouth-pieces which, from contemporary analogies, were formed of two bars, each with a loop at either end; one of these bars would have its loops set in the same plane as the central part; the other would have its outer loop set in the same way (for attachment to the reins), but its inner one twisted through 90o, so as to interlock with its counterpart.

The list shows that T. 285, the least disturbed of our rich tombs, was apparently the richest in obeloi, producing a minimum of over twenty traceable examples, though most or even all of them could have been deposited on the same occasion. The more ruinous T. 219 may also have received its obeloi on a single occasion. The other seven tombs involved have produced more meagre, and in some cases tiny fragments: with T. 247, in particular, one wonders whether the piece may not have floated in from elsewhere. An important feature of the obelos-burials is their wide apparent range of date. Since V Karageorghis' invaluable reinterpretation of the 'pikes' from the Fortetsa tombs {Antichità Cretesi: Studi in onore di Doro Levi (1977), II, 168-72), it has been clear that obeloi were not uncommon offerings in Knossian tombs from PG times on. But the main period of intensive deposition remains the later eighth and seventh centuries, on which J. Boardman's paper in KCh 23 (1971), 5-8 is a helpful comparative study. Our finds do not do much to reinforce the belief that obeloi had significance as a primitive currency at Knossos in the period of the cemetery: the relatively well-preserved find 285. £43/44/45 contains ten pieces, rather than six or a multiple thereof, as would be expected from later Greek usage, and as had indeed already become the rule in several parts of the Greek world by the late eighth century (see J. N. Coldstream, GG, 146-8). FIRE-DOGS These are found (as already noted, p. 575) in three of our tombs. Predictably, they are nearly always found in close association with obeloi, yet the converse is not true: obeloi appear to occur in nine tombs; and of at least fifteen depositions in which they are found, the great majority yield no trace of fire-dogs. This conforms to other findings: from Cyprus, for example, the papers by Karageorghis and Boardman, cited above, list some twelve dated occurrences of obeloi and only two of fire-dogs. Many of our specimens appeared in the form of short strips of rectangular section and, re-reading the Fortetsa publication with hindsight, one may perhaps detect in such entries as that for F. T. XI, no. 192 references to earlier finds that were not recognised as fire-dogs. As with the obeloi, the main period of deposition was clearly in the LG and EO periods, with one or more possible earlier occurrences. Total L.

Since fire-dogs are usable only in pairs, the most economical hypothesis is that T. 285 received three pairs, of three different sizes; and that T. 219 and T. 283 had respectively three and one pairs. FIRE-BASKETS' (219. £65, and (?) £47, 78, 127, 132, 136; 285. £84) This interpretation of the objects in question is decidedly provisional, and rests on the reconstruction of 219.165. This object, of LG date, must be restored to an original overall length, without its wooden shaft, of some 50-60 cm; on this assumption, it is missing more than 20 cm of its main, socketed arm (a), more than 60 cm of its two curved side-arms (b), and perhaps some 200 cm in all of its numerous cross-struts, which appear to have been set at intervals of about 3 cm (to judge from the three recognisable stumps that appear along the sides of (a) and (b). The other finds of fragmentary rods in this tomb (219. £47, 78, 127, 132 and 136) collectively provide i. 12 cm of side-arm and c. 120 cm of cross-strut; they could therefore all derive from the same piece. More problematic are the two fragments (L. together 15.7) in 285. £84, which are of later, EO date; they correspond well enough to the form and dimensions of the cross-struts from T. 219, but there is no other recognisable evidence for the presence of such an object in T. 285. One can however say that, from the other finds in this tomb, there is nowhere where one would more readily look for a further appearance of this item. In discerning the purpose of such an object, one can use the evidence of the external associations, in both cases including fire-dogs and obeloi, and that of the features of the object itself: an open-work, roughly hemispherical holder, mounted on a wooden shaft which had the approximate diameter of a spear-shaft. Clearly it was meant to hold some loose material, in pieces that were big enough not to fall through between struts placed some 3 cm apart. It is</page><page sequence="308">IRON 593 suggested that this material was burning charcoal or other combustible materials, and that the function of the object was either to help in igniting the pyre for cremation, or to serve in some operation connected with the hearth in a domestic context. For either purpose, the inferred presence of a substantial wooden shaft would enable this material to be held at more than arm's length. I know of no parallel for such an implement, but then our own fragments would not have been recognised for what they are, but for the lucky survival of the partly restorable piece 2ig.ft&gt;5. 'BIER-ATTACHMENTS' (219. f67, 70, 129) Once again, a tentative interpretation is offered for a class of object not previously recognised for this period and area. This time, however, there is some external support in the occurrence of somewhat similar objects as handle-attachments for a wheeled bier, in a rich Etruscan tomb: see L. Pareti, La Tomba Regolini-Galassi (1947), 266, N. 229 nos. 19-20; 289, N. 237 nos. 29-31, pl. 31-better illustrated, but probably wrongly interpreted, in RM 22 (1907), 86, 106, fig. 11, pl. 68.151. Our three preserved specimens from T. 219 are all of LG date; the lengths of the two virtually complete examples (21.0 and 19.5) correspond well enough to the range (20-23) of the Etruscan examples. The socket-diameters are not identical in the three cases: 2i9^f67-D. 4.3; f7o-D. 3.8; fi29~D. 4.7; but this is not a serious obstacle to their having been used for the same bier. The massive size of the sockets suggests that these objects were designed to bear a heavy load or undergo strain, and the bending of the blades of £67 and £70 may tell the same story. The presence of the cross-strut (originally one of a pair?) near the end of the blades of £67, fixing their relative position, at least serves to exclude some of the potential alternative explanations. A bier would of course require four of these attachments, but the disappearance of the putative fourth one is hardly surprising. Finally, three other classes of sporadic and fragmentary objects may be listed here. Their condition does not invite attempt at interpretation, but it may be noted that they all occur in our richer tombs, with weapons and tools, and often with obeloi and other funerary apparatus.

We shall deal with pins, fibulae, bracelets, rings and tweezers in that order. PINS Four distinct varieties seem to emerge, three of which may be roughly equated with types known from the Fortetsa cemetery; but the state of preservation seems to have been better there, and most of our specimens are too corroded for fine detail to be visible. Type A A single find of two matching SM iron pins seems not to correspond to previously known types. Iron pins in tombs of this period are not unexpected (cf. F. no. 35), but they are few enough for it not to be surprising to find novelties.

The only iron ring at Fortetsa, F. no. 1 148, was much later. TWEEZERS Fragments of two pairs of tweezers, of O date, were 292^43 and 50. The arms are narrower than those described in F. 196 but, as little more than the pinched grip at the top is preserved in either case, one can say no more about their type. General Conclusions In approximate terms, the body of ironwork here presented amounts to about three times the quantity included in the Fortetsa publication. This being so, it is perhaps disappointing that the typological range already known from there has not been more substantially extended. This result is in large part a reflection of another feature of our finds, the striking homogeneity displayed by the commoner classes of object, over some four centuries. It was hardly to be expected that a single type should account for some 71% of the swords, 85% of the dirks, 83% of the daggers, 97% of the spearheads, 66% of the javelin-heads and 63% of the knives respectively. That the community using these tombs was a conservative one might already be inferred from the traces of hereditary attributes and practices which were noted earlier (pp. 576-7). The typology of the finds reinforces this impression. But the resemblance to the Fortetsa finds is also marked. Here are two groups of families, sufficiently distinct to cremate their dead in cemeteries several hundred metres apart, almost on opposite edges of the Knossos area, but sharing very similar customs. The grouping of the Fortetsa tombs according to their iron finds, as on pp. 576-7 above, would also result in a profile of pyramidal shape, with more than half of the tombs lacking iron weapons and tools altogether. There is nothing surprising about all this: it merely conforms to the evidence, which others have wished to reconstruct on quite different kinds of argument, of a society composed of parallel family groups, each with its own pyramidal social structure, so that an individual in one group, of whatever status, would have his close counterpart in the neighbouring group.</page><page sequence="312">IRON 597 A few new metal types have emerged which will doubtless recur - and perhaps be otherwise interpreted - in the future; a few others have had their chronological range extended. Beyond that, the contribution of our iron finds is mainly quantitative; they enormously increase the body of evidence for early iron metallurgy in Crete. The mass of fragmentary objects, and the few well-preserved finds, combine to give us a glimpse of how strongly the prestige of wealth and warfare, and indeed of the grave itself with its rituals, must once have been reflected in the N Cemetery.</page><page sequence="313">CHAPTER 13 FAIENCE AND GLASS V. E. S. Webb Finds of faience, glass and Egyptian Blue are suggestive in their distribution through time of the state of contacts between Crete and the East. The finds compare closely with those from F., though there are some differences. This is inevitable when the total number of finds is so small and of a special nature. Glass and faience beads minoan survivals From Subminoan tombs come gleanings from Bronze Age times. T. 200 contained two faience beads of 'seed' shape of a common Late Minoan/Mycenaean type, f2a, &amp; b1235 and a spherical faience bead, if),1236 which is also most likely a survival - while in glass there is one core-wound trail-decorated bead, £6,1237 as well as fragments of a dark blue glass bead, fu (originally spherical?). This last is reminiscent of finds in a late PG grave on Skyros, where blue glass beads and gold discs (both Mycenaean survivals) are also found together.1238 T. 121 yielded one sub-globular glass bead, fjj, probably also reused. The only other find of undoubted Bronze Age date is a glass rosette, fi2, found in the dromos of T. 219 with PG material, together with an ivory disc, inlay piece fi6. This rosette, originally of dark blue glass, is of the fine Late Minoan/Mycenaean type1239 with the elaborate double petals on its mould-made face. It is identical to perforated discs found as necklace elements in both Crete and Late Helladic Greece. However, in this case there are no perforations, and the back is flat - probably an inlay element for wooden furniture(?) or dress(?). These few relics indicate the poverty of Subminoan Crete both in technical skills and in external contacts. Faience disc beads With the onset of PG, such survivals apparently cease (with the exception of the glass rosette above). In their place, we find faience disc beads appearing in a number of burials, though in nothing like the quantity in which they are found at Lefkandi1240 and 1235 Goldstein, no. 17 1-2; Mcdonald, Nichoria, Hesperia 44 (1975) 78, pl. 20; Mycenae, Wace, Chamber Tombs at Mycenae (Oxford, 1932) pl. 13, 51, and pl. 36. 1236 Cf.

E. S. WEBB Athens.1241 In many cases they were left scattered on the floor of the tomb when PG material was cleared out at a later date. Such is the case with T. ioo (faience disc beads fi6, 27 and f28a) found associated with a miniature dentalium shell (f28b),1242 T. 207 (fj) and T. 219, passim, while T. 310, with faience discs in situ and covered in ash, is equivalent to the remains of a pyre belonging to T. 219. Only in T. 219, £6 with a LPG group in the dromos, and in T. 285, f34a in pot 89, £70 in pot 136, and £73 in pot 61, are associations preserved, giving a date range from LPG to PGB, mid to late ninth century, with an isolated stray(?) in a late tenth century Attic import, f^i in pot 121. Similar disc beads are found on other sites in Crete at this time,1243 and they indicate the existence of some sort of contact with the Eastern Mediterranean - most probably Cyprus. (The dentalium shell found with one group above is suggestive.) Compare the finds of rod tripods at Vrokastro and Knossos1244 but the dating of the disc beads at other sites is often much less certain than at Knossos. In Cyprus, similar strings of disc beads occur in contemporary inhumations at Amathus, in this case still, apparently, in position on the body;1245 and their use and prestige may not be unconnected with the custom in Third Intermediate Period Egypt of 'clothing' the mummified body with a network of faience disc beads and amulets.1246 The beads found at the N Cemetery all fall within certain parameters of height and width, and must come from one source. As noted above their quantity cannot compare with those from Lefkandi and Amathus, so perhaps they came via Cyprus rather than through more direct contact with the Levant coast itself. A direct link is already suggested for the finds from mainland Greece because of the pairing of wound glass eye-beads of a specific type with the faience.1247 The only other find of faience beads, 75.f27, is in a LG association. These are of a different type, very small, and of a very fine texture, with a blue glaze; they occur in groups of linked tubes, and probably formed part of an elaborate collar or necklace with several interlinked strands or a network like that mentioned above. But not enough survives to reconstruct it. Finds of early faience vessels, such as could bear comparison with the outstanding finds from Lefkandi,1248 are so far lacking. Glass beads With the beginning of the Geometric period, and its precursor PGB, we see another reflection of radical change in the material. The faience beads disappear and in their place we find the beginning of an impressive series of glass beads. These are initially well-formed and of a very high quality (although now often badly corroded). The EG T 280 has one sub-spherical glass bead, fi, now badly laminated and opaque, but with a well-formed string hole. These beads are of translucent glass, spherical or sub-spherical, and would appear to mimic transparent 1241 Athens Agora, 'Grave of a Rich Athenian Lady', Hesperia vi (iq68) 77f, 114, no. 78a. 1242 Necklaces of disc beads: Amathus, SCE II pl. 20, T. iA.Qi: dI. 24..

T. 285, MG pithos 39, the cremation of an adult male (?) contained five sections and a complete example, fi6, of a different type of glass bead which is much smaller and has a transparent violet or light brown colour. These show clear signs of manufacture by winding a 'cane' of glass round a large central rod. Identical beads are found in 75.109 (MG), f33a together with a double barrel-shaped bead, f33b9 and an impressive series of graduated spherical beads, f33c, which were originally of translucent green but are now very badly corroded to creamy opaque, with a flaky surface and lamination around the string hole. Also from this interment is a very fine spherical bead of originally translucent glass, fji, similarly corroded. In scale these last are much more like the EG find, and they can probably be compared with the few beads found in the foundation pots buried either side of the tomb door in the tholos at Khaniale Teke.1251 Whether these fine large beads represent the revival of Minoan crafts, reused material (a possibility which becomes increasingly unlikely with the passing of time, but see Delos and Crete1252) or most likely reflect the importation of materials and techniques from the Near East, it is not yet possible to say. Boardman argued convincingly for the burial caches and their gold jewellery being signs of Near Eastern influence and settlement,1253 and the Teke school of goldsmiths is now a recognised factor, with its ability to work both gold and rock crystal. Whether this know-how extended to the production of glass beads, we cannot yet say. But what is interesting is that there is no sign at Knossos of the core-wound, trail-decorated beads which occur with PG and later finds in the mainland. (See Higgins' comparison of the trail-wound bead in the Rich Athenian Lady's grave with an example from Sidon.1254) Also in the assemblage in 75.109 was a bun-shaped brown bead, fi7, clearly made in yet a third manner, by being flicked onto a flat surface to cool, which accounts for the lop-sided shape. This last type occurs in great quantities in T. 78 (LG/EO), and has many parallels from the Votive Deposit at Camirus,1255 material which dates to around 700. In T. 219, £24 may be a fragment of a similar bead, while fi8 and £38 are very decayed translucent glass beads. There are two final examples of the earliest, translucent spherical type. From a LG interment, 229.6, f$9 found together with faience scarabs (see below), a rock crystal disc, an amber oval, and a silver pin, is a single corroded spherical bead, showing the typical lamination around the string hole which is also found in the examples from EG T 280 and the MG 75.109. One other find, probably G, is 292. fi7, also badly corroded and laminated. So this type seems to last through from EG to LG. A new type of spherical bead is first encountered in T. 292. They occur both as isolated finds, fi2, 15, 19, 34 and 52, and as a graduated set of beads in Niche 4 (LG/O) £27. These are clearly intended to look the same as the older, spherical type, but they weather in a 1249 Zakros rhyton, HM no. 2721, and Axel von Saldern, in Goldstein pl. 37a. 1250 See Starr and Vandiver, op. cit.

Some still remain translucent icy green, though others are now weathered and opaque. The most telling sign that they are different is the join line running down one side which is revealed by weathering. This must indicate the point where the molten glass cane did not completely blend with itself They do not corrode and laminate like the earlier type. Beads like these can be identified on other sites in the Aegean, for instance at Athens, at Eretria in the votive deposit dated to the latter part of the eighth century,1256 and at Camirus, Rhodes;1257 it seems that they may also be related to translucent, pale green, spherical beads found in the West at Tharros1258 and at Tarquinia.1259 Harden,1260 and more recently Goldstein1261 have already suggested parallels with the pale green translucent glass objects made at the Assyrian court, examples of which include the Sargon alabastron and a group of hemispherical bowls,1262 one of which occurs in F.* 263 in a late eighth century context, while a very similar bowl comes from Praeneste.1264 Similar beads, but without good contexts, come from the Teke tombs, where three plain hemispherical or subspherical beads of pale, green transparent glass come from H.fiz, Q.f2 and Q.fi8; these are most like the beads from T. 292, above. Also in this category are the two beads 14. fB and 10, from a tomb first used in LG/EO, and 107. fi4» Of MG date is the example from T. 125.fi, unless its presence there is due to the later disturbance. From T. 292 two other glass beads must be mentioned: a sub-spherical bead of dark honey- brown colour, £21, which is probably related to the spherical examples above; and a disc of whitish glass with bevelled edges, £75, an interesting mimic of the faience discs which still survive in the East and make a later reappearance in Greece.1265 See the other glass disc of quite different design in an O interment, 285«figc.

T. 78 - the pithos containing an inhumed infant of 12-16 months - held a rich collection of imported faience figurines, scarabs and amber, as well as glass. Not only was there a long necklace consisting of approximately fifty-five subspherical glass beads (£6c, d &amp; e together with amber and rock crystal) but also a rod of glass, fu, which can be nothing else than a hairpin of a type last seen in Late Minoan burials. The beads are of three different types, but all of the same approximate size, although variations may reflect an original graduated set. First, originally thirty-two beads of the dark honey-brown type, like those in 75.109; second, a group of opaque, mottled beads which look like a local attempt to copy the same; and thirdly a set of glittery, silver, ring-shaped beads. All these have close parallels with the material from the Camirus Votive Deposit.1271 However, a faience spherical bead, with a yellow-creamy core, the glaze now gone, is of a type only touched on here, because it occurs only as a survival of a common LM type.1272 The glass tube, hollow and with a thread wound spirally outside, has to be compared with Minoan material: see the recent finds of glass hair pins with crook ends, which have been made in LM III burials in northern Crete.1273 Did these two objects both come from earlier contexts? Two remaining interments of EO &amp; O date contain beads of various types, but of glass and technique not fundamentally different from LG finds. 107.59, an ÉO cremation urn, contained fragments of spherical and tubular beads, in three different fabrics: the golden- yellow corroded f47a9 the brownish-violet, f47b &amp; c, and the honey-brown glass, f47d. From the cremation in a MO pithos of a girl of 18, 285.33, the small finds comprise the assorted remains of a pathetic necklace, which included an opaque spherical bead (fi9b) of a type found commonly in G burials and at Camirus, a glass disc (fi9c) with grooves, and a fine large spherical glass bead (f24) grooved in eight segments - no parallels for these two last have been found in the N Cemetery - while a crystal disc (fi9a) and two natural beads - a fish vertebra (f2o) and a fossil shell (fi8) - formed the rest of the necklace. There are no finds of the opaque, coloured, core-wound and trail decorated glass beads which appear at Camirus, Athens, Sounion, Eretria, Artemis Orthia, and other mainland sites in Greece of the eighth and seventh centuries, and which, in the case of early finds at Eretria and Athens at least, are associated with faience disc beads and with material in the northern Levant (see n. 1247). Objects of glass An enigmatic fragment, 292^56, may represent another type of late eighth-century glass - a vessel (jug) which makes its appearance at F. in no. 1650 - a small flask of dark glass with trail- wound white glass.1274 Finally, a glass pomegranate pin head is most likely of Roman date, Tuffila."75 1270 GGP 382-3, GG28Q-QO. 1271 BM unpublished, under nos. 1977.6-26 etc. 1272 See SM aoo.fg and n. 1236. 1273 Tomb A at Archanes, /&gt;£, 45, 1970, 154; Tholos D, rich woman's assemblage with two, PA E 1975, 263-4, pl. 234a, 237; Metochi Kalou, AD 33 (1978) 104-05, pl. 2ie, with full discussion of parallels. 1274 Gladys D.

Previous finds in Crete comprise three scarabs in a LO context (F. nos. 1076-8) and one dated to MG, from a tomb on Gypsades.1276 All the scarabs presented here fall into the LG-EO span. Two in T. 229 (£3-4), found with a glass bead in the LG/EO pithos 229.6, are of white fine fabric, with coloured glaze remaining. Both have simplified beetle backs and single, simple devices on the base: an ujat eye, and a horse(?).1277 All the other scarabs found are of Egyptian Blue, the fine compact material with an integral surface1278 which is found widespread in Greek sites and in the West from the mid-eighth century onwards.1279 Its use, originally assigned specifically to Naukratis and therefore previously dated to the Saite period alone, clearly goes back much further than the first Greek settlements in Egypt. A source in the Near East is more likely - see the use of the material for scarabs and amulets in Assyria and Syria, and especially the distribution at Al Mina.1280 However, that is not to say that certain Egyptian Blue scarabs did not come from the Naukratis factories whose existence was so clearly demonstrated by Pétrie.1281 In T. 78, the LG-EO pithos burial, four Egyptian Blue scarabs (£3-4, 9-10) were found as well as the faience figurines (see below); but unfortunately these were all poor specimens, with emblems erased. Two other finds of O date, 48. f4 and 107. f6, bear simplified hieroglyphs, of which the second, with its hatched border, must certainly come from Naukratis. Faience figurines From the rich LG-EO pithos burial T. 78 come three faience figurines, the only ones from the N Cemetery. (From F. the only comparable piece is the Ptah-Embryon, no. 924 from tomb P2.) Two represent the Egyptian god Nefertum, (f8, 24); the third is also an originally Egyptian deity, Ptah-Embryon,1282 more correctly called Ptah-Seker-Osiris. NEFERTUM (FIG. 182; PLATES 297-8) The two Nefertum figurines would seem to come from a similar source, for they are both of poor workmanship and material and represent only the most important features of the deity. The larger, 78. f8, does not have the suspension loop which marks out so many other figurines of Nefertum as amulets. Instead, although intended to be a free-standing statuette, it is not well enough designed to stand up, since the base is too small to support it; moreover 1276 Lower Gypsades, BSA 76 (1981) 157, no. 122 in MG pithos no. 62. 1277 For similar motifs see Lindos I, nos. 1443-6. 1278 Chemically defined as copper tetrasilicate, used in New Kingdom Egypt, Early Iron Age Assyria, Iran and the Near East for vessels, beads, amulets and small decorative items.

For similar figures of the god we can refer to finds from Crete,1283 Megiddo,1284 Kition1285 and Rhodes.1286 Such figures are modelled with flat backs and bases, mimicking the walking stance and the back pillar which served to support the original stone statue of the Egyptian prototype.1287 There, however, the flat back pillar often bore an inscription as do many faience amulets of the same deity; but these faience imitations have cross-hatched glaze paint or other decoration instead, whilst the features of the face bear greatly altered proportions with large almond-shaped eyes, etc. One group which can be distinguished in the material consists of examples from Camirus1288 to be dated to c. 750-650 with an exact parallel in a piece from Cyprus,1289 and is made of hard fabric with clear, harsh modelling. Another grouping can be made between the examples cited from Megiddo and Kition which are smaller and less boldly modelled, and show some oddities of design, with cross- hatched skirts etc. For the example here, with its very poor quality material which is crumbling badly, and its crude modelling, no parallels exist as yet. The second Nefertum, 78^24, has lost the suspension loop, now broken off, and is also missing its high floral headdress. It is a small crude version of the amulet type and as such bears a very poorly moulded inscription on the back pillar which relates it to amulets of deities found in mainland Greece1290 and the West,1291 and is to be dated from around 750 to well into the seventh century. PTAH-SEKER-OSIRIS (FIG. 182; PLATE 297) The third faience figurine, 78.Í2O, is of a much higher standard, with hard textured faience and detailed modelling. It represents the widespread and popular deity Ptah-Seker, shown wearing the Atef crown and backed by Isis in winged protective pose, with the sun disc and horns on her head. The incised almond-shaped eyes and harsh, clear style of modelling suggest a link with the Nefertum figurines from the Well at Camirus, while the clearly cut imitation hieroglyphs on the base compare with the related figurine of Ptah-Seker from Camirus, which has a more elaborate version of pretend hieroglyphs.1292 F. no. 924 is a smaller simpler example found together with a faience alabastron, no. 923 in the EO pithos no. 892 in Tomb P2, clearly a deposit of similar date and itself comparable with figurines mounted in silver foil from Vulci.1293 Ptah-Seker was a common subject for faience amulets in 1283 Crete: Kommos, in the Tripular Shrine, c. 700 BC, together with a Sekhmet (pers. comm. from the excavator, J.

WEBB the Eastern Mediterranean and the West (see for example the range of types from Lindos1294), and they seem to have been manufactured in the Levant, as well as in Egypt itself. The degree of closeness to Egyptian models is one measure of their possible source, but not enough comparative material exists to pronounce on origins. The presence of three such pieces together with four scarabs in the burial of a small child is unique in the N Cemetery and cannot be matched in F. although there are two small and very fragile pieces from there (F. no. 264 miniature figure, PG(?), and F. no. 1149, faience flute player, O) in addition to no. 924 the Ptah-Seker found with a faience alabastron in the EO context already mentioned. This exceptional find suggests that they had some special significance, either as an indication of status (exceptional wealth, foreign origin) or as objects with amuletic(?) force; compare the appearance of scarabs in the children's graves at Pithecussae1295 and, later, the presence of faience objects in children's burials on Rhodes.1296 Faience vessels couchant lion vases (fig. 180; plates 298-300) Two examples of an unusual vase type are 2ig.f62 and 100. £41. This is a hollow vessel in the shape of a couchant lion holding a vase between its extended front paws. The rounded body of the lion conceals a pipe and reservoir inside, which are filled by means of a hole in the base, and which must have enabled the original user to make the contents appear and disappear at will in the small pot held between the lion's paws. Related 'lion bowls' which were made in soft stone, ivory, or Egyptian blue coated in gold1297 are a common find in the Near East, and have been thoroughly discussed.1298 Our finds have a similar purpose but derive from a different prototype. Note in particular the cubic head of the lion, with closed mouth, and the pose of the lion's hindquarters, which both suggest parallels with Egyptian depictions. For the origins of these couchant lion vases with human hands we must look first to southern Palestine, where Megiddo has provided three very similar pieces,1299 and ultimately to the royal iconography of Late New Kingdom Egypt, where the Pharaoh, as a lion-bodied sphinx, makes his offering to the gods in uplifted hands.1300 However, the apparently well-dated context from the German excavations at Megiddo of Stratum IV, which has been used to give a date of c. 1000 BC for its faience pieces (and to imply an established industry there1301), is not reliable at all.1302 The appearance of the type in Greece must in any case be dated much later.

To judge by find contexts in Greece, the vases were influential by the first half of the seventh century (see the clay adaptations above), and must have been known in Crete for some time before; the Idaean Cave example could belong to any period between 850 and 650. The contexts of our two examples are also ambiguous, for the complete example lay on the floor of T. 219 and so could conceivably belong with the lower stratum EPG-PGB; however, as it was also near to the stone set as a base of an Attic MG II amphora, I think it much more likely that it is associated with the later finds, most probably with the early LG pithos 38« The badly weathered base fragment, ioo.f4i, comes from an MPG-EG tomb thoroughly disturbed in Roman times, and so may not be part of the original tomb contents at all. A date around the middle of the eighth century seems most likely. Vessels in Egyptian Blue BOWL (FIG. 180) The plain bowl 219. ¡"83, with ring foot and no trace of handle, is of fine brilliant blue material, now weathered to violet in parts. A Near Eastern source is very likely, as the similarly shaped glass hemispherical bowls1307 from Assyria, F. no. 1650, and from the West. It belongs with the late LG pithos 31. Other vessels of Egyptian Blue are known from Samos.1308 JUG WITH REEDED HANDLE Two fragments, 65.Í3-4, are perhaps from a quarry, and are not associated with a tomb. They are of O or R date; see the Samos catalogue for discussion of similar jugs in faience, and for their ultimate origin in jugs with handles in the form of reeds, or bundles of lotus-stems.1309 Faience Vessels - Orientalizing Period The final group of faience vessels are all of the O period. First, two fragments which suggest the import of Egyptian or Near Eastern faience vessels. The 'bow' or 'thistle-shaped' handle, 13. f2, belongs to a bowl - see the Egyptian finds made in Samos.1310 The distinctively shaped rim, 26. £9, probably comes from a round-bodied alabastron-type vessel like a find from Chios-Emporio.1311 All the remaining pieces probably come from T. 34, although some were found in the dromos fill of T 56. 1303 Idaean Cave in Halbherr and Orsi, Museo di Antichità Classica II (Florence, 1888) 70. 1304 Rear quarters only, Votive Deposit; see fig. in AGF, fig. 22 to be published for Italian School by Marina Martelli. 1305 Dictaean Cave: Boardman, CCO pl. 22, no. 62; Knossos, BSA 57 (1962) 33-4; Aetos, Ithaca BSA 43 (1948) pl. 41, no. 558. 1306 r Hampe, op. cit.

WEBB PHIALE MESOMPHALOS (FIG. 181; PLATES 294-5) So far a unique piece, the elaborately decorated phiale 34^40 shares much in style with the other products of the workshops which made faience objects and vessels for the East Greek market, using the technique and imitating the low-relief style derived from Egyptian Low Relief ware of the Third Intermediate Period.1312 The only comparable piece is a boss recorded from Lindos.1313 Our piece exhibits true low relief, unlike the pyxides and alabastra, but the particular combination of animals - wild goats, or more probably ibex1314 - in pairs against a background of lanceolate trees,1315 or grouped either side of a stylized 'tree of life',1316 shows that we are very close to East Greek faience. Our phiale is probably from a different, perhaps slightly earlier workshop than the routine production, and more like the copies of other Oriental forms in faience found at Camirus, e.g. the tripod candelabra,1317 and the three-footed bowl with frontal figures and corresponding lid1318 which mimics forms made originally in bronze or ivory.1319 The date is middle to late seventh century. OVOID ARYBALLOI (FIG. 180; PLATE 293) A number of similar fragments (34.f25-6; 56. £42-3, 52, 55-6, 58-9) belong to several examples of a type early in the series subsequently produced in the Aegean.1320 Related pieces are F. nos. 1557-8. They are apparently local, i.e. Aegean imitations of an elaborate prototype like the pieces from Cumae,1321 intended to carry some scented oil, and perhaps originating in Egypt. However, both the technique of decoration - incuse background above and low relief sepals1322 below - and of manufacture - neck made separately and inserted by means of a plug - are very close to Egypt. Three necks and one handle survive, so there were probably three examples in total. Their date may be in the first half of the seventh century. PYXIS (FIG. 180; PLATE 294) There are fragments of one or perhaps two (34.&amp;0; 56.144, 46) examples of the distinctive small pyxides which, with related alabastra and aryballoi, were produced in a factory in East Greece, probably Rhodes,1323 with a floruit lasting from 650 until 600. Like all other examples, these fragments bear incised decoration arranged in registers, and depicting a very limited repertoire of animals and plants.1324 At least two registers survive, with ducks flying over miniature papyrus plants, bulls and gazelles parading against a formal background of stylized trees, and at least one lion. A comparable example is from Arkades.1325 Other finds from T. 34 confirm that there were strong trading links with Rhodes at this time. The date is second half of the seventh century. 1312 Von Bissing, Nachr. Gottingen (1941) passim; G. A. D.

This is comparable with the fabric of western examples of the glazed ware alabastra with zoned decoration1326 of which no fragments survive from Crete. The vessel may bear a closer relationship to the glazed ware pointed jugs, like examples from Gordion and the Phoenician West.1327 Insufficient work has been done to establish a source for this undoubtedly imported ware. Conclusions We can see, from the distribution through time of glass and faience, that certain distinct patterns emerge. Faience disc beads typify the PG period (along with a few Minoan survivors found in SM tombs). They confirm the links with Cyprus which are already evidenced by bronze, iron, and ivory imports. Glass beads, spherical and sub-spherical, begin in EG (probably in PGB in the Khaniale Teke tholos) and carry on through G into EO. They are confined to a few distinctive types and, though the earliest may be reused Minoan finds, their later popularity must be due to contemporary activity either in Crete itself or, more likely, in glass making centres in the Near East - particularly N Syria or Mesopotamia. The same holds true for the Egyptian Blue bowl, for the glass bowl F. no. 1650 and the jug 292. £56 with which it can be compared, also indicate the position of Crete as an intermediate post on the sea trade routes between the Eastern Mediterranean and the West. The faience couchant lion vase is, by contrast, an Eastern type which is thoroughly at home in eighth and seventh-century Crete, being present both in the original faience on several sites, and in local clay copies and adaptations. Its origin lies in the strongly Egyptianizing styles current in Early Iron Age Southern Palestine. Does its presence in Crete owe something to the vigorous trading contacts established between Greece and the Levant inMG? The faience figurines of originally Egyptian deities, found in one LG/EO burial, T. 78, bear witness to a slightly different phenomenon - the occasional occurrence in Crete of exotic objects which are otherwise found only on sites with a strong link with the Eastern Mediterranean, or on the trade route to the West. However, one must bear in mind the rich find of faience amuletic figurines from the Cave at Inatos, in southern Crete, which was dedicated to the birth goddess, Eileithuia.1328 Similarly, the faience and Egyptian Blue scarabs, which come initially from the Levant, with the latest examples probably from Naukratis, are found, where known, in the burials of infants or children, as also at Pithecussae. Lastly, in T. 13, T. 14, and T. 34, always in O contexts, a group of faience vessels indicate the growth of interest in a new area, Egypt. The earliest - the aryballoi - are closely linked with 1326 yon Bissing, Zeit und Herkunfl 98-113; Peltenburg, Levant I (1969) 73-96; Webb, op. at (n. 1265), forthcoming, no.

Other finds, including the phiale, are the products of those specialised workshops which sprang up in East Greece, probably Rhodes, in response to an intense interest in Egypt, during the second half of the seventh century. Their presence here is incidental to developments in Crete itself; they merely chronicle the rising importance of the East Greek states, and their increasing success in controlling trade with Egypt, and in channelling it into a new south-north axis, as well as the old east-west one.</page><page sequence="325">CHAPTER 14 TERRACOTTAS R. A. HlGGINS The terracotta figurines from the N Cemetery are, sadly, few in number and disappointing in quality, even when supplemented by the addition of certain plastic attachments to vases. There are only three representations of human beings, all from vases. The earliest, 219.72, is the head of a warrior, which was attached to a PGB pyxis, of c. 840-810 BC. His features are strongly indicated, with a large nose and a small mouth, and he wears a helmet with a crest. Two generations later is a jug topped by a representation of a human head, 106.20, of about the middle of the eighth century. The head, which is thrown back, has a prominent nose with clearly marked nostrils, projecting ears, a large mouth, and applied blobs for eyes. No more than 219.72 can this piece be regarded as a work of art by any standards. It may, however, reflect a genuine eighth-century style, as a somewhat similar terracotta head is recorded from Gortyn.1329 Another century leads on to the head, 107.32, which shows the far-reaching results of what can only be described as the Daedalic revolution. It decorates the lid of a pithos. The style, on Jenkins's system, is Middle Daedalic, of about 650-640. 133° It is typical of Cretan Daedalic at its best, with its large eyes and cheerful expression and the carefully-rendered layer-wig. The animals are a motley crew. One of the best is the bull, Q*f25, which, from its context, is dated 840-810. He has a certain style about him, which gives him an almost Minoan appearance. A somewhat similar bull was found at Kommos, in a slightly later context.1331 A contemporary piece from the same tomb, Q.f24, represents an unidentified animal which rested on the strap-handle of a vase. The goat, 31.3, of the later eighth century, is a more lively creature altogether. He is represented in the act of leaping, in a manner recalling Late Minoan art. The ram-protome, 107.218, of the seventh century, probably comes from the rim of a vase. 294. fi2, which cannot be dated more closely than in the eighth or seventh century, is a ruin, but apparently represents the head and neck of an unidentified animal, perhaps a horse. Even more enigmatic is 285. £4, the rump of some animal, perhaps a goat. Its date is 840-810. A pyxis lid, 285.1, is decorated on top with a striped flying bird. Its date is 850-825, and it recalls a number of contemporary terracotta birds from Tomb X at Fortetsa.1332 Finally, some unexplained objects, 57^5-8, and 82.Í4 and 6; the former probably, and the latter certainly, of the seventh century. They could well be the legs of model tables or thrones, but such an identification does not explain the absence of the rest of such pieces of furniture. 1329 G. Rizza and V.

M. Cocking1333 Introduction The textile remains from the N Cemetery excavations are an important contribution to the evidence for the production and use of cloth in Early Iron Age Greece. There are seventeen groups of finds from the tombs, fifteen from the University site and two from the Teke area. One is a small piece of cloth; three are negative impressions left by cloth in earth trapped between the fabric and the cremated bones around which it was wrapped. The rest are positive replacements of cloth formed when textiles are buried in association with metal, in this case bronze vessels, an iron pin and an iron dagger. As the metal oxidizes and decays the corrosion products replace the textile fibres, leaving a hard 'fossil' of the original fabric known as a mineral replacement. On most of our examples this has left exact representations of the cloth adhering to the metal. Raw materials The main possibilities for the identification of the fibres of our textiles are cotton, silk, wool and flax. The first two are unlikely. Cotton was cultivated by the early Indus civilizations,1334 but it moved westwards very slowly, only being introduced into Assyria around 700 BC1335 The earliest Greek example is from Eleusis in the fifth century BC,1336 although even then it was imported. Indian and Egyptian cotton seems to have been widely known in Greece but the first signs of its cultivation there are not until about the seventh century AD, when it was grown in Thessaly and Macedonia.1337 Silk was cultivated in China from c. 2600 BC,1338 but was not known in Greece until much later. The earliest possible references to silk are to the luxurious dress of the Persians in Athens in the fifth century BC,1339 and the possibly silk Amorgian chitons' referred to by Aristophanes 1333 Acknowledgements: I should like to thank Dr. H. W. Catling who invited me to publish this material and made many useful suggestions regarding the text, as did Dr. C. F. Macdonald. I am also grateful to Dr. J. H. Musgrave and Mrs J. A. Macgillivray who observed the negative impressions in the course of their own work at Knossos, and to Dr. J. P. Wild who gave valuable advice on the technical aspects of the textiles. 1334 E.

Greek production seems to have been on a smaller scale. 1338 its invention is attributed to Si-ling, wife of the Emperor Huang-ti (c. 2640 BC). 1339 Hdt, i. 135; iii. 84; vii. 116. Xen., Kyropaidia, vii. 40, both mention the dress of the Persians and describe it as luxurious and beautiful. Later Tertullian, De pali iv. 542 (ed. Oehler) and Procopius, History of the Wars i. xx. 9-12 describe the dress of the Persians as being of silk.</page><page sequence="327">6i4 J- M. COCKING in the 'Lysistrata'.1340 However, Aristotle, in making the first definite reference to the silkworm in Greece, still regarded it as a novelty.1341 Both wool and flax are perfectly possible. Sheep bones occur even in the Early Neolithic levels at Knossos, although it is unknown whether the wool was used to produce textiles.1342 There is certainly a strong case for an important wool industry in LM Knossos in the light of the Linear B tablets.1343 Flax, the bast fibre used to make linen, is one of the earliest attested textiles in the Aegean; a cloth impression on an Early Cycladic dagger from Amorgos has been identified as linen.1344 Fragments of linen were found on one of the swords from the Chieftain's grave at Zapher Papoura.1345 In discriminating between these fibres the direction in which the thread was spun is a rough guide. Thread spun with the spindle rotating anti-clockwise is referred to as cS'-spun, as the central bar of the CS5 corresponds to the direction in which the fibres lie. Threads spun with the spindle rotating clockwise is referred to as cZ5-spun. Linen is usually 'S'-spun. The prepared fibres of the flax plant are usually moistened before spinning to draw them together. The moist flax tends to twist to the left and is therefore usually cS'-spun. Wool may be spun equally successfully in either direction, the fibres having no natural preference, although in practice it is usually 'Z'-spun. The threads of our textiles are consistently 'Z'-spun, i.e. clockwise, suggesting that they are wool. This is borne out by the general appearance of the fibres at X 25 magnification. Further analysis has been carried out by Dr. T. Margaritoff of the National Museum in Athens. Techniques Oxidization is too severe to allow study of the preliminary preparation of the fibres, though the smooth and even thread suggests that it was combed before spinning. Almost all the thread is tightly spun, i.e. the angle between the slant of the twist and the vertical axis of the yarn is between 25o and 35o. 1346 This results in a firm thread, the average diameter of which is 0.07 cm, the thickness of modern heavy duty thread. We cannot tell if the fabric was dyed, but the few non-mineral replaced areas show no traces of colouring substances. The fabric was probably woven on a warp-weighted loom, common throughout Ancient Greece. In Crete, the use of this type of loom is first indicated by loomweights from the Middle Neolithic Stratum at Knossos;1347 and from then on loomweights are discovered in their hundreds into the Roman period. The warp-weighted loom consists of a horizontal upper beam supported on two posts. The vertical warp is stretched between this and a series of weights close to the ground; the beam also acts as a roller to store completed cloth. The weft is threaded between the warps on a 1340 Ar.

Mechanization is made possible by dividing the warps into sets and passing one set in front of a lower strut while the rest hang down the back, but are attached by a separate thread to a heddle rod in front of the whole work; when the heddle is pulled forward on to forked sticks protruding from the uprights the back warps come to the front exposing one shed or passage through which the weft may pass, and when the rod is released the front warps present the complementary shed.1348 The majority of our textiles are in tabby weave, (FIG. 194 a-c, PLATE 312 e-g): the weft passes under and over alternate warp threads for the first row, returning for the second row under those it went over, and over those it went under: the two-row pattern is then repeated. Tabby, also referred to as plain weave, is the most common ancient weave and was certainly the easiest to work on the warp-weighted loom, as it required only one heddle. The average number of threads per centimetre is between fourteen and sixteen, the equivalent of modern medium-weight 'linen' weave. The example on the dagger from T. 24 is in weft-faced tabby weave. This is worked in the same way as plain weave, with a greater number of weft than warp threads. In this case there are twelve warp and twenty two weft threads per centimetre, producing a fine, firm fabric. Two examples show some sort of pattern, both are from T. 107.57 (PLATE 312^. The body of the fabric is in tabby weave with the pattern formed by two rows of countered horizontal wrapping (FIG. 194 b) formed by the weft passing over two warps and back under one for the first row and coming back in the same way for the second, thus forming a CV shape horizontally across the fabric when beaten down into position. On one fragment the pattern occurs only once, where it has been worked in a two-plied yarn, giving it greater emphasis; on the other there are three bands of pattern separated first by two and then by seven rows oi tabby weave. This pattern would be impossible to work on a warp-weighted loom using heddles in the usual way. It seems likely that the pattern was inserted with a separate thread and a needle between the rows of tabby. It would be possible to embroider the wrapping after the whole of the cloth was woven, though the way in which it is set between the woven areas suggests that this was not the case. The purpose of the wrapping is unclear.1349 Perhaps it was purely decorative, in which case it is surprising that there are no more examples on the many fragments from the same tomb. The design is very narrow and would require a great deal of repetition before it became a prominent feature. Such a pattern is unlikely to have been chosen in preference to a decorative tabby-type weave which could have been worked on the loom.1350 The horizontal wrapping may serve to strengthen and draw the fabric together at the beginning or end of working. Wrapping is not unknown in starting borders on the warp- weighted loom in northern Europe,1351 although it was not common in Greece where a firmly woven border in which the warps were inserted in the form of a long fringe seems to have been usual. The rows of wrapping could have acted in very much the same way as a spacer chain to keep the warps in position while weaving began. 1348 For more detailed descriptions and illustrations of the warp-weighted loom see G. M. Crowfoot, BSA 37 (!936-37) 36-47 pl- 6; M. Hoffmann, The Warp- weighted Loom (Universitetforlaget, 1964) and H. Ling Roth, Ancient Egyptian and Greek Looms 2nd ed. (Oxford, 195O- 1349 There is a comparable example from the Graeco- Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in Afghanistan, to be published by M. G. Vial. 1350 for examples of patterns possible using a basic tabby weave see G. M. Crowfoot, Textiles, Basketry and Mats in C. Singer, E. J. Holmyard and A. R.

COCKING Alternatively, the wrapping may have been part of the finishing border of the fabric. The way in which the thread locks itself over each warp would certainly prevent the wefts slipping and would strengthen the fabric as a whole. This seems the most likely solution in view of the only other unusual fragments from 107.59 (PLATE 312 g). These are two sections of the lower edge of a piece of fabric finished with a fringe. The main body of the fabric, of which there is little evidence, is of tabby weave, finished with horizontal wrapping. There may well have been more than one band of wrapping at the end of the weaving of a piece of cloth, both for added strength and for decorative purposes. On the fragments from 107.59 only one row of horizontal wrapping is visible, further rows being covered by the beginning of the fringe (PLATE 312 g) formed when lengths of slightly thicker yarn were folded in half and threaded through the fabric, the ends of the strands being passed through the loop created and then pulled tightly upwards. The finished strands no longer exist, having decomposed below the level of the cloth. Another fragment from the same group consists of two of the weft threads below the level at which the lengths are inserted, bound with two strands of fringe. The fabric on the bronzes from T. 107 was probably finished with several bands of countered horizontal wrapping and a fringe, although we do not have evidence for this on one individual piece. Function The function of our textiles seems clear. The bronze fragments on which many of the impressions are preserved are from metal vessels, in which cremated remains were deposited; the cloth was presumably a preliminary wrapping for the bones and ashes. This is borne out by the evidence of the cloth impressions in hardened earth. The piece from T. 75 was found inside a LG/EO burial pithos. The two examples of textile impressions on earth, adhering to bone from tombs G and N, show that the remains were wrapped very closely, as the textile impression on the skull fragment is on the inner curve of the bone and the tiny metacarpal is completely surrounded by cloth. Either these bones were very near the edge of the parcel placed inside the urn, or they were wrapped in separate small groups before being placed inside a larger package inside the urn. What was the original purpose of the cloth? It could have been woven specifically for wrapping the cremated bones. It may have been a garment or other item belonging to the occupant of the tomb. The only piece of evidence which points to this is the fragment of fringe from T. 107. A fringe would not be necessary on an ordinary piece of wrapping cloth, other finishing borders being more effective and economical. However, a fringe may be a feature of either a garment, sheet or curtain etc. The fringe from T. 107 is worked in almost the same way as the multiple rows of fringing on the textile from Lefkandi, the strands on the Knossian piece being looped over several wefts rather than only one as on the Lefkandi example.1352 Though it would be rash to suggest that the fragment belonged to a garment such as that found with the hero of Lefkandi, it may well mean that the ashes of the dead were wrapped in a textile that had been in normal use. 1352 M. Popham, E. Touloupa and L. H. Sackett, Antiquity 56 (1982) 169-74, pls. 24 and 25, for the preliminary report; T. Margaritoff, / Vradhini 3-11-83, for an illustration of the fringing technique.</page><page sequence="330">TEXTILE REMAINS 617 The only piece whose exact use is slightly difficult to interpret comes from an iron pin from T. 292. The impression is well preserved and shows the fabric twisted over the head of the pin and draped and folded around the shaft. It was not individually wrapped for its own sake. There are two further possibilities: one is that the pin was incorporated within a garment deposited inside the tomb. This is suggested by the folds of fabric which may indicate a piece of cloth of some weight gathered at one point and secured with the pin. The other possibility is that the pin was used to fasten the cloth-wrapped bones before they were put into the pithos. The heavy folds could be caused by tight gathering into the pin; all the other textile remains have been connected with the wrapping of the remains of the dead. That the pin was not found in association with a burial urn, but in the dromos, is not important since there was much disturbance and nothing remained in situ. The textile on the iron dagger from T. 24 seems to have been used simply to wrap the individual object. The impression is preserved on both sides of the blade and shows no folds, and there is no other indication that it served any other purpose. Date Our textiles come from a very small proportion of the tombs. Table 15. Numbers and date of tombs containing textile remains. Tomb Period of Use G PGB-EG N PGB-MG 24 E-MPG 25 E-MPG 34 EO-LO 75 EG-EO 107 PGB-LO 292 PGB/EG-LO Although this is a small sample, it suggests textile-wrapped cremation may well occur from EPG to LO, or virtually throughout the Dark Age life of the cemetery. Was wrapping in cloth a common feature of burials throughout the period? Textiles are only preserved under very special conditions. In the case of mineral replacement the fabric needs to be in close contact with the metal object undergoing oxidization, and the environment must be correct as far as humidity etc. are concerned. Impressions on earth rely equally on chance; a small amount of earth needs to be pressed evenly between the cloth and a firm surface. Even in the event of fabric not disintegrating over the course of time, newly excavated textile remains are difficult to identify, and many are inadvertently lost in the process of cleaning and preserving the object to which they are attached. It is likely that our cloth remains are representative of a much larger group of textiles used throughout the period EPG-LO to wrap cremated remains before in-urning and burial. The single example of the wrapping of grave goods obviously cannot prove that this was a regular practice, although the chances of such wrappings surviving are even smaller than the cloth in the urns, as there is no weight pressing the fabric against the metal. In this case, the cloth does indicate the use of fabric in inhumations as well as cremations.</page><page sequence="331">6i8 J- M. COCKING Comparable examples in Greece There is an increasing body of information concerning cloth remains in Greece from the prehistoric period onwards. The majority are tiny fragments or impressions published only in relation to the objects on or with which they were found. The examples given below are confined to those directly comparable with our textiles. The closest parallels to the examples from the N Cemetery in date and function are from neighbouring Fortetsa1353 and from Arkades.1354 Both are EO-LO dinoi containing cremated remains which appear to have been wrapped in cloth which now adheres to the sides of the vessels. In the Fortetsa example the cloth is tabby weave, eighteen threads per centimetre for both warp and weft, and is folded up to halfway up the sides of the dinos, in some cases as much as five layers deep. This gives a good idea of the original appearance of our fragments. Outside Crete there is an interesting example of cloth inside an urn from a LG grave at Eretria.1355 Mineral-replaced fabric, identified as linen, lines the inside of a copper vessel; the cloth is plain weave with eighteen warps and twenty-two wefts per centimetre. Fabric was also found inside an urn from an LG grave at Eleusis.1356 The textile from Lefkandi was also found inside a bronze amphora used as an urn; although it dates to between iooo and 950 BC, it provides important technical and functional comparisons with the Knossos pieces as discussed above.1357 Evidence for the wrapping of grave goods also comes from Fortetsa. Cloth adheres to a bronze pendant and an arrowhead from Tomb P, and to three iron pins from Tomb II.1358 In Athens, mineral-replaced textile wrapped iron tools and weapons in an EG I grave in the Agora.1359 In an EG II tomb on the Areopagus, an iron pin also preserved traces of plain woven cloth.1360 An iron pin in Grave C in the Agora at Corinth shows traces of cloth down the full length of its shaft.1361 The cuirass from the eighth century tomb at Argos seems originally to have been wrapped in cloth, although only a little of the fabric now remains.1362 Conclusions The cloth remains from Knossos are an interesting example of the preservation and nature of archaeological textiles. They illustrate a much larger body of evidence for textiles in the Early Iron Age, and give indications of both the raw materials and production techniques. All the fabric seems to have been wool, woven in the usual manner on a warp-weighted loom, with the interesting feature of being finished with some sort of fringe. The widespread use of cloth to wrap both cremated remains and goods before burial alerts us to the probable existence of many more textile impressions on comparable objects. These could provide more detailed information on the textile production, which was necessarily such an important feature of life in ancient society. 1353 f no q5o. 1354 Tombe Singole a Pithos, Pithos 93.

EVELY Introduction The material here considered is divided initially by substance (e.g. stone, clay), and then internally by type (e.g. Buttons, Whorls and Vase fragments). To some extent this approach cuts across potentially related groups of objects, such as Beads (appearing in stone, clay and amber) or Whorls (in stone and clay), further extending to involve the major studies of other scholars in this volume. Thus, Pins (here of silver) are found made of bronze and iron too. For such instances of objects found in different materials as fall within this overall section, cross- references will be drawn, but for a wider appreciation, other chapters likely to be relevant should be consulted.1364 Opening with the most numerously represented substances, the account is first concerned with items of stone and then of clay. Next come pieces made from ivory or bone, metal (silver and lead) and amber, followed by two more general groups, first in sundry perishable stuffs (Eggshell, Seeds and Fruits, Wood and Shell), and second of a later and intrusive sort (stone architectural pieces, Turkish clay pipes, glass mosaic tesserae and vessel fragments). Objects of Stone (figs. 184-6; plates 302-04) As no doubt befits a group of material derived from an Iron Age cemetery, the stone items are predominantly associated with personal adornment (beads, pendants and ? cosmetic tools), and less, if at all, with everyday domestic activities (whorls). Utilitarian objects (such as whetstones or handles/pommels) did nonetheless accompany their owners to answer essential, if humdrum, needs, and the duller moments of the deceased's time might be whiled away in a simple game (as indicated by sundry sorts of 'counters'). Only the very occasional piece could serve some religious purpose. In addition, there is a series of objects that are either purely intrusive (bits of stone vases and the ubiquitous obsidian blade and flake fragments: both likely to be stray Minoan items), or conceivably reutilized both from recent contexts (large stone vessels, or parts thereof: in 1364 xhis work was started as Macmillan Student of the BSA in 1981/82, and completed with financial aid from the School and the British Academy during 1984 and 1985. Expert identification of the bone or ivory was kindly given by Sheilagh Wall, and of the vegetable material by Dr. C. G. Vosa of the Botany Department, Oxford University; Emma Faull contributed a number of the more complex line- drawings; and the text as a whole has benefited from general discussion with Dr. Mary Voyatzis and Dr. Irene Lemos, who also kindly read it in manuscript. My thanks to them all. There are both potential and definite areas of interest in which my chapter overlaps with those of other contributors: thus, some stone and amber pieces fall also within the province of Dr. Webb's studies (ch. 13). Tombs of SM date are considered in toto by Dr. H. W. Catling (ch. 9); some contain items of ivory or bone and other substances that would otherwise have been taken into my account.</page><page sequence="335">622 D- EVELY their own right or doing duty as supports for clay vases) and from stores of family heirlooms (Minoan sealstones). Only the very last of these groups need have anything especially relevant to the funerary practices of the Early Iron Age. The Beads (14) cover a wide, if simple, range of shapes: spheres, discs and near-hemispheres making up the majority, with cylindrical, tabular and biconical forms also occurring. The substances from which they were fashioned are dominated by rock-crystal (9), with singletons of carnelian and amethyst completing the count of the semi-precious ones (J.fi2 and 9). 1365 Serpentine, or related stones, contribute too: beads for the most part (14. f6; LG/EO; 218^32; 285. fg). Pendants (11), with the exception of a fossil shell (285.fi 8) and a disc of serpentine (26.fi8), are fashioned from rock-crystal in a variety of guises: a double-axe J.Í8: PG); a naturally derived elongated pentagon (78.fi7; LG-EO), and a graded set (7) of biconical shape (Q.£8). It is a reasonable assumption that the beads and pendants belong to necklaces, or even bracelets. As a rule they are not accompanied by others of stone: the three beads and a pendant in T. J and the set of biconical pendants from T. Q are exceptional in this respect. The presence in the tombs, however, of beads of other substances makes it possible that the stone ones served as focal points within these: thus, rock-crystal beads perhaps accompanied others of faience or glass (Ts. 78, 219, 285), of amber (Ts. 18, 78, 229) or even possibly of clay (Ts. 219, J, Q). There is a tendency for such finds to belong to tombs noted for their reasonable, if not considerable, wealth of grave goods. So far as chronological implications go, both beads and pendants can certainly be said to be rarities in the PG era, and to continue to occur thereafter with much the same degree of infrequency. Potentially related to such ornamental items is a fragment of a rectangular strip of rock- crystal (78.f23). Its shape and size would make it suited to a role in one of the complex pieces of gold jewellery produced in the region of Knossos: there are, however, no confirming signs of such items in this tomb, or indeed in the cemetery as a whole.1366 A dozen or so funerary sites in Crete have yielded stone beads and pendants, as has the settlement of Vrokastro.1367 It should occasion no surprise to find that serpentines and steatites, being both naturally plentiful and easily worked, met the demands of the majority of the population's needs throughout PG and G times: Arkades and Vrokastro between them demonstrate a wide range of forms, simple in concept and rather rough in execution.1368 Other sites, Dreros (adding breccia to the stones), Kissamo and Knossos, extend the repertoire.1369 Rarer are pieces made from semi-precious stones: amethyst and agate appear at Knossos, lapis lazuli at Knossos and lapis lacedaemonius at Kissamo; and carnelian in some quantities at Patela Sfakia, Vrokastro and Knossos.1370 All (except 1365 Beads of rock crystal are located in Tombs J (£6: mostly PG), 18 (fa: PG-O), 34 (fi8: EO-LO), 78 (£6a: LG- EO), 123 (fi: ?EO), 219 (f22, 33), 229 (£B) and 285 (figb: in Ó pithos): of carnelian and amethyst, Tomb J (fi2 and 9). 1366 See further on this line of jewellery in footnote 1373. The nearest one comes to such here is in the Minoan amethyst sealstone set in gold (i8.f3), and in the amber and gold pin (218. fi2). 1367 The tomb sites include Arkades or Afrati, Dreros, Kissamo, Knossos (Ay.

In marked contrast, rock-crystal was widely appreciated throughout the Early Iron Age: Arkades, Dreros, Knossos, Liopetri, Vrokastro and Kissamo all yield examples, of which the biconical pendants at Dreros and Vrokastro are exact parallels to those in Q.f8.1372 Some crystal inlay pieces at Arkades, Vrokastro and the Idaean Cave may represent remnants of jewellery by the proposed Oriental Masters resident in the Knossos area in PGB-EG times.1373 It is generally supposed that the raw material was imported from the East.1374 Stone beads and pendants often are found in combination with ones of other substances: of clay at Vrokastro and Liopetri, amber in the Knossos region, and most frequently of faience or glass as at Knossos, Vrokastro, Liopetri and Patela Sfakia.1375 Thus, the N Cemetery material fits quite happily into the range of the stones, the shapes and the manner of presentation seen to be general throughout Crete from the late tenth to the seventh centuries BC. There does not appear to be any significant divergence in availability, preference or customs as generally represented at the same time on the Greek Mainland - particularly in Lefkandi and Attica.1376 The suggestion of a cosmetic purpose for the slender limestone Cylinder (i.f3), and for the Pestle (75«£|2) is but a hazarded guess: the latter might serve to grind up a pigment, the former to apply the same. There is nothing, however, in either tomb to strengthen this postulation. A similar degree of uncertainty attends the identification of that small group described often as Whorls (8); an alternative is in most cases attached to the catalogue description.1377 The conical forms (6 or 7) of steatite or serpentine are most likely to belong to the well-known LM III group, and represent one of many such threads of continuity in the transition from Bronze to Iron Age: they occur in SM, PG, G and O contexts alike. They are not likely to have been originally part of the spinner's kit,1378 though whether the identity of button or of necklace component is to be preferred is not established. Only one item (14^5: LG-EO) might be a true whorl. Such conical buttons or 'whorls' appear all over Crete in funerary contexts and, where they have been investigated, at both settlement and sanctuary sites too. Thus, examples are 1371 Suggested, primarily for rock crystal, by Hutchinson and Boardman, BSA 49 (1954) 219. 1372 Arkades 477; Dreros: van Effenterre, ECr VIII, 41 (Tomb 8); Knossos: Teke (cf. n. 1373), E nos. 136, 11 18, 1150; Liopetri: Davaras, AD 27 (1972) B2, 650 (Tomb V); Kissamo: CCO 92, fig. 39, pl. 31; Vrokastro 137 ff, especially Tomb 3, fig. 85 O and R; also in Bone Enclosures 2, 6, 8. 1373 Arkades, 477; Vrokastro, 156 (Bone Enclosure 1); Idaean Cave: Halbherr Antro 68; Knossos: Teke tholos 215 ff.

Given the frequent accompaniment of the deceased's ashes by any number of iron, and even some bronze, weapons and tools, it is astonishing that more devices for preserving the sharpness of an edge were not recovered: two Whetstones, and two pieces of Pumice alone make up that class, satisfyingly from tombs of a wide range of dates and with tools and weapons. The pumice (285 - uncatalogued; 292 - likewise) consists only of nodules with surfaces flattened by use; the whetstones comprise rectangular-sectioned slabs or bars. Their faces (iO7.fs&amp;7; 294^9) are hollowed by a stropping action, and the latter is pierced for suspension. Whilst the settlements of the PG and G periods at Vrokastro and Kavousi have produced between them parallels for both pumice and whetstones (along with other stone tool types - querns, pounders and polishers), only whetstones are represented, and that but occasionally, in tombs. Examples covering the complete PG and G periods come from Knossos, Kourtes, Vouves and Vrokastro;1380 as in the N Cemetery, an elongated bar or slab form with suspension holes at the end(s) predominates. Here may be considered two Handles or Pommels. One (287.16: LPG-PGB) is of a canonical sort that, from its shape and substance (limestone), might be of Minoan manufacture;1381 perhaps the bronze flakes from the tomb mark a disintegrated blade. Altogether different is the other (2ig.fno), apparently once slotted onto an ?iron pin, and partly secured by iron plates ('washers' in effect) on each side: it could make a rather cumbersome sword pommel. The contents of the tomb, ranging over EPG-LO, are particularly rich in number and character, which makes a positive association and identification impossible. There are no good parallels reported from elsewhere in Crete. An unexpected, and thereby intriguing, insight into the leisure pursuits of the Early Iron Age can be glimpsed in a suggestive array of Pebbles (294.117). Of the fifteen pieces, six are 'white' spheres and six 'black', leaving three dark and somewhat angular pieces: perhaps for a board game of six men a side. Less clearly associated with any game, but equally belonging to no other more obvious class, are a further four objects: a sphere of quartz (30. fio); a roundel of kouskouras (34«f22, O), an unfinished item of steatite (283^5) and finally a plano-convex piece (219.fi 16). The quartz and steatite pieces could also serve as bead blanks. Gaming of this elementary sort is, if elusively, witnessed at a few localities in Crete. The most complete is at the Geometric settlement of Kavousi, where a broken stone slab is interpreted as a board: roughly rectangular, it bears a circular channel, divided in two by a groove, and contains five hollows in each half. Chevrons fill in the corners. With this is presented a clay counter. From a MG tomb at Knossos, a set of three spheres of stone was interpreted as gaming pieces.1382 Strong support for the existence of board games in the PG and G Aegean is offered from Lefkandi where, in addition to dice, two sets of spherical limestone 'marbles' were 1379 Knossos: F. no. 854.

Of an odd shape (?cut down from another item), it is basically a slab, with one end heavier and thus acting as a foot, as well as having projecting buttons behind. On each face a crudely executed motif or design has been scratched. The main face bears a pattern somewhat reminiscent of a leg or foot (though a horse has been suggested too), whilst the reverse carries an equally enigmatic avian head. The top has a simple geometric incised decoration. The tomb (LG-EO) had been badly disturbed in antiquity and so gives no aid in the interpretation of this peculiar piece. Though no close parallel has come to light, there is a small number of finds that help to set it a trifle in perspective. These, largely derived from disturbed funerary contexts of PGB to EO in date, are often conceived of as grave markers in some form. This is a most reasonable interpretation for an example from Prinias, where a careful double outline engraving delineates a male (Pwarrior) torso.1384 Cruder work enlivens a small steatite disc from Vrokastro with three animal silhouettes.1385 At Knossos, other tombs at Teke have produced work comparable to both the above: a kouskouras plaque or stela portrays, in neat relief, a sardonically smiling male (Phelmeted) head, together with an uninterpreted device on the reverse. Another plaque fragment depicts, in incised outline, animals and simple linear patterns.1386 Thus the technique, its clumsy execution and the potential subject matter of H. fi may all be paralleled; its actual subject matter and ultimate purpose, however, both remain stubbornly obscure. Most immediately identifiable amongst the intrusive material are two Minoan Sealstones (each typical of its sort), and a potential blank. The amygdaloid of chlorite (129. fi) was cut in MM III or LM I, whilst the lentoid of serpentine (J.fio: PG) with its naturalistic design, is of not much later manufacture, dating to LM II or III.1387 The blank (a.fi: SM) is just that. The pieces come from tombs potentially covering the entire temporal range of the Early Iron Age use of the cemetery. Whilst Tomb J (PG) also yielded a few stone beads and a pendant (with which the sealstone might have been threaded), Tomb 129 (EG-EO) was so lacking in grave goods as to make the sealstone undeservedly prominent. The presence in this last tomb of obsidian - surely a chance introduction - raises the possibility that the sealstone too is only accidentally present. Such again could be the case for the blank, found in a SM tomb. The preservation and continued use of Minoan sealstones in later periods should cause no surprise: they are amongst the most long-lived items manufactured in the Bronze Age. Within this same cemetery (18. fj) is an even more dramatic and quite unequivocal witness: the MM III-LM I amethyst of a lion attacking an agrimi, in a gold setting of c. 800 BC. Cretan peasantry were still utilizing sealstones as amulets (galopetras) three and a half millennia after 1383 Lefkandi I 82, pl. 66 q, r and 237 e, for dice and 'marbles' respectively. 1384 Prinias: Rizza, Cron. d'Arch 8 (1969) 31, pl. 18. 1, dated to LG, and references to others in Crete.

EVELY the fall of the palaces.1388 From Early Iron Age contexts, such pieces have been retrieved from mainly funerary contexts at Knossos, Liopetri, Prinias, Sykia, Vrokastro and Zakro.1389 Of much the same period of original derivation, no doubt, are the Obsidian blade fragments, flakes and core remnants. Their occurrence, albeit in no great numbers, at points all over the cemetery provides another example of the manner in which both production debris and the broken blades themselves have become generally distributed throughout the soils in the neighbourhood of Knossos. Nine blade pieces (Tombs 75, 79, 107, 129, 285, 287, 292), up to ten flakes and lumps (including one from Giali - Tombs 98, 132, 208, 283, 285 and G), and part of a core (Tomb 285) make up the complement: the presence of blade, flake and core in Tomb 285 is merely coincidental. Such blades are reported from a tomb at Vrokastro, and from others of MG-LG date at Praisos: they are probably intrusive there too.1390 The story is the same for the half dozen Minoan Stone Vessel fragments, of serpentine and limestone (Tombs 75, 98, 106, 292 and Q). It need not be, however, in the case of a limestone basin and a mortar (24.^6 and 5: SM/EPG tomb, but pillaged), though these may be more in the nature of dromos-biocVing material than grave-goods proper. Another limestone object (6o.f3), of uncertain date, was arguably doing service in a secondary role as a cremation urn support. Elsewhere in Crete, references to stone vessels generally seem to be to small and simple forms of Minoan bowls (Vrokastro and Dreros settlements) or to kernoi or libation tables (Arkades) still in active use. Tombs at Zakro and Knossos have yielded sundry lids and vases in general Geometric contexts.1391 It is surely the case, anyway, that the Iron Age peasant farmers, just as their modern equivalents do, retained the ability to improvise simple troughs and basins out of local field stones. Objects of Clay (figs. 187-8; plates 306-07) Most items in this category were intended to adorn the human body: the incised and stamped clay beads belong to necklaces, or perhaps bracelets. In the case of the whorls or beads, however, one relapses to a familiar state of uncertainty as to their correct identification. The loomweights are unequivocal - in identity at least. To these are added a number of decorated finials or attachments - definitely part of the funeral gear. Lastly comes a mixed group of intrusive or, at best, but fragmentary components of the tomb's structure or contents. With the Beads (47+), one encounters a well-known class of object: often they are spherical, yet many are conoid, while some biconical and even cylindrical forms are encountered. Of a refined beige to red-brown fabric (sometimes reduced to grey, presumably from the effects of the cremation), they are generally now in such a friable condition as to argue for very slight, if any, firing originally. On the spherical sort were cut or imprinted a series of geometrically arranged patterns: either made up from vertical slashes, or divided into three zones with slashes either side of a frieze of concentric circle motifs or of a zigzag.

For the most part the beads occur as singletons; only in Tomb J is it clear that a whole necklace was built up of them. The firmest indication of date is given by the largest group J.f2 and 13): predominantly PG. In almost all the other instances, there is a PG use discernible within a broader span (often down to O times) of the tomb's use: Tombs 30 (ft), 219 (ft a), 283 (£¿4), D (ft) and Q, (fi2, 13). Only Tomb 294 (£6, 13) dates solely to a later period of MG-LO. The more unusual conoid-based, decorated pieces (152.fi, 283^4) could belong anywhere within the Geometric era: conceivably later rather than earlier. Crete offers a full and widespread range of parallels: almost a score of localities have produced examples from tomb, sanctuary and settlement alike.1392 They occur both in ones or twos, and also in larger groups (Anavlochos, Phaistos and Praisos) that suggest derivation from necklaces. The outstanding group is the 250 and more beads from a PG grave at Ay. Ioannis, Knossos: here are encountered almost the maximum range of shapes, and certainly the widest and most complex number of patterns. All the N Cemetery pieces find parallels here. As a whole, the 'triple-zone' form of decoration finds wide acceptance in Crete - with slashes bordering a central band of circles, zigzags, chevrons, dashes and so on. All-over decorative schemes (vertical ribs mostly) are rarer. Plain spheres, discs, cylinders, cones and biconical forms also turn up intermittently. All these may be found in secure PG (even SM to PG) contexts - but do not seem to exist prior to that. Their lower temporal limit is less readily ascertained. They certainly appear in MG and even LG contexts but it cannot be ruled out that here they are but survivals. Thus, whether production was maintained into the eighth century BC is at present unanswerable: the rather unusual examples from apparent Geometric contexts at Anavlochos may be late or merely local. The Attic connections of this object type have long been known. Excellent reviews of the Mainland and Island varieties may be found by Boardman, Smithson and Bouzek: a fuller appreciation emerges therefrom.1393 It is relevant here only to observe that though a distinct generic connection with the Balkans is supportable, yet specifically the two main Greek strains are relatively independent both of the Balkans and from each other. There is not, then, an irresistible need to view the Cretan pieces as imports. A scattering of tombs have yielded a dozen examples of the problematic Whorl or Bead pieces: Tombs 19^5), 59 (**)&gt; IO7 (fí*3* 26, 36, 45), 294 fö, 14, 16) and 306 (ft, 2, 9). These comprise discs or cylinders of baked and occasionally painted clay. They range in size between 1.5-3.5 cm in diameter, 1-3.5 m thickness and weigh generally between 6 to 12 g. All are pierced centrally, the hole averaging 0.5 cm across. The question, as always, is whether the weight of the object and the diameter of the central hole are sufficient to permit them to be classified as spindle- whorls: it is opined that these specimens could be so suited, apart perhaps from the smallest and lightest. In which case, one can only conclude that articles of domestic and industrial purpose qualified as acceptable grave goods in Geometric and Orientalising 1392 Tomb: Knossos: Ay. Ioannis, esp.

It is unclear whether they were always placed in the tomb as single objects: those from Tombs 107, 294 and 306 come from mixed contexts covering the entire G and O eras. Objects identified as Whorls are well spread in Crete, though are commoner in stone than clay.1394 They occur in twos and threes at least, shaped into discs, cylinders, cones and biconical forms, generally devoid of ornament. Praisos and Knossos (Atsalenio) each yielded a singleton with a simple coat of paint, and from the latter site, too, came an example without parallel. As well as being painted black, it had been incised on each face with a rosette, with a zigzag at the periphery. A point to observe is their apparently later date than the beads: most have G contexts rather than PG. Mainland parallels, and an alternative interpretation, may be found in the Lefkandi settlement report,1395 but the object is basic enough to have a long history with a multiplicity of purposes. Loomweights, on the other hand, declare themselves at once. The three specimens recovered are all pyramids: Tombs 100 (fu) and G (fu, 12). Regrettably, in each case, the basically PG to G tomb had been subject to considerable interference in Roman times: an observation which, when coupled with the stamped cavalryman motif on 100. fi, renders them all suspect as intrusive pieces. Early Iron Age Crete has not been prolific in yielding clay weights of any size or shape. Those few reported are mostly from settlement sites of broadly Geometric date: pyramidal, biconical and various spherical types are known, but not their numbers or relative frequency.1396 The existence of pyramidal weights has also been remarked on at Lefkandi, where it arrives or develops in the LG period.1397 Together, these observations go a little way to reinstating those in Tomb G as genuinely Early Iron Age pieces, but the stamped one, ioo.fii, cannot be earlier than HL.1398 The Finíais comprise a most curious class of object. Pieces of five were recovered from Tombs 56 (f57), 57 (f5-8) and 82 (£4), though it cannot be safely assumed that all belonged where found. Tombs 56 and 57 impinged on each other, and were ruinously plundered in the late sixth century BC; under these circumstances items will have been shifted about, maybe even as far as Tomb 82, only a few metres to the southwest. As Tomb 57 retains the most examples today, so it may have once been the home for all: it dates to EO-LO, as does Tomb 56, with Tomb 82 restricted to LO. Thus, the pieces are definitely Orientalizing, as perhaps their use of polychrome decoration recalling that of the pithoi would hint also. Their purpose can only be guessed at: in form, they are reminiscent of furniture components, whilst the solid and striped ornament in black and red paint on a white ground would argue that they were meant to be conspicuous. The central socket with its cross-peg holes makes it clear that the object was to be slotted onto something. All in all, it seems most likely that they were part of 1394 Dreros: Marinatos, BCH 60 (1936) 270, fig. 33; Praisos: Droop, BSA 12 (1905-06) 33, fig. 10 (Tomb 53); Vrokastro, 122, fig. 73; Arkades, 479, fig. 591; Zakro: Hogarth, BSA 7 (1900-01) 148; Kavousi: Boyd, AJA 5 (1901) 132-3, 141 in tombs and settlements alike; Knossos: Atsalenio, 139, pl. 3id; F. nos. 200, 730.

The Building materials (tile and mud-brick/plaster) are probably best seen as later intrusions, though there is no reason why mud-brick might not have occasionally served some simple role in the tomb itself, as can be seen in Tomb 182 here, and at the 'Heroön' at Lefkandi.1400 The exception is a clay Cuboid ?Stand (D.fio: LPG-EG): of no great size, solid and handmade, it bears a simple and rather poorly arranged pattern of concentric circles.

Triada, which is identified as an altar from its context.1401 Apart from their basic form, however, the two items have little else in common. That from Ay. Triada is earlier in date (SM), more lavishly decorated, and once supported something modelled in clay. Objects of ivory and bone (figs. 189-93; plates 309-11) Although few and including rather mundane objects, the mere presence of ivory, let alone the combination of gold leaf and bone, gives an importance to these items beyond their actual modest numbers. The major concentrations are in Tombs 219 and 292: scenes of considerable confusion, as well as being utilized for the best part of the Early Iron Age. Chronological deductions are accordingly curtailed. As a luxury material ivory, and by imitation bone too,1402 will naturally be used in objects intended for display. Therefore, it is worked into personal ornaments, into handles and hafts of weaponry and of toilet accoutrements, and inlaid into furniture, or attached thereon. The items of Personal Ornament are the least impressive: two bone pins (40^9) and some potential beads made up from fish vertebrae (75.Ì28, 285.Í2O).1403 Their context is broad, but may on balance be G-O rather than PG. The only exception here is an ivory and bronze spectacle-fibula (285.f22), for which see p. 553. Finds in Crete are scarce and relatively ordinary - with the obvious exception of other spectacle-fibulae. Pins are recorded from tombs in the Knossos region, and at the Psychro Cave sanctuary: most (from PG contexts extending into G at Psychro) are of simple format with but a few grooves at their head. A poppy-headed one exists at Teke. An EO tomb at Teke yielded a broad disc-head reminiscent in size of the silver pins to be discussed below.1404 One bead of bone is known: of 'melon' type, it comes from a PG tomb at Knossos, as does an ivory 1399 They are but poorly fired and thus not strong enough to withstand the knocks of everyday life. This fact does not detract from their careful production and decoration. 1400 Lefkandi: tombs of PG date in and outside the Heroön building used such brick extensively (Popham in conversation, and my own experience); and see further in Lefkandi I, 199 fF; Popham et ai, BSA 77 (1982) 224, fig. 5. 1401 Ay. Triada: Banti, Ann. 3-5 (1948) 57, fig. 57 a &amp; b: probably SM in date. 1402 Of the half dozen pieces of securely identified bone (4O.fg and 14; 2g2.f6i, 69, 74, 79), all that can be said (courtesy of Sheilagh Wall) is that the larger pieces were made up from mammalian limb bones - probably cow or horse; 292. £79 is identified as cut from an equid metatarsal. The predominance of bone in Tomb 292 is noteworthy, as is the realization that here too come the instances of gilding (16 1. 79) and staining with gilding (fko). 1403 From 'T. 244' comes a head of a bone pin, which from its shape and decoration could well be Geometric. I cannot locate any Cretan parallels, but a certain degree of similarity can be seen between it and some in the Péloponnèse: Kilian- Dirlmeier, Modeln, pl. 63, nos. 1942, 1046-7. 1404 Psychro: Hogarth, BSA 6 (1899-1900) 113, fig. 48; Knossos: Teke, Catling, AR 29 (1983) 51; Teke, Hutchinson, BSA 49 (1954) 227, pl. 29.70 and 71; F. nos. in, 195 and 204.</page><page sequence="343">63o D- EVELY pendant.1405 The spectacle-fibulae, attached to iron pins, turn up from cave (Psychro) and tomb (Prinias) alike, where they no doubt belong to the earlier segment of the Early Iron Age (PG-PMG). No two carry exactly the same compass-based pattern, though circle-and-dot and rosettes are widely shared motifs.1406 With the Sleeves and Handles, matters improve. Seven objects fall into this group: apart from a poor specimen from Tomb 45 (fio: EPG), they divide equally between Tombs 219 and 292 (both disturbed, and used from PG-O times). Tomb 219 contained a good portion of a chevron-patterned tubular handle or staff, with a group of ribs and bands at one end, and cross-peg holes for securing something inserted into or added on to it (2i&lt;).f35); rather less than half of another with a plainer grooved or fluted pattern (219.187) and lastly the eroded remains of a handle shaped into a pair of naked females, standing back to back and with their hands at their sides (2I9.Í27). The poor condition of all the ivories in this tomb is very marked. Matters were better in Tomb 292: it yielded a second chevron-patterned tubular handle/staff, with cross-pegs of copper/bronze (292^79), yet another such with a debased 'lotus-bud' pattern, and a cross-peg of bone (2g2.£6i) and what looks like an entire sword-hilt with its pommel and a side loop built in (292.Í49). Unlike Tomb 219, however, only the very last item is made of ivory, the other two are of bone (one at least from a horse). This, however, is balanced by the discovery that both the bone objects were once gilded, traces of the leaf being preserved now only where it has been protected in the incised lines of the pattern. The ivory sword-hilt too has some intriguing purple patches above the recessed zone at the side loop: could it have been stained? Was the recessed zone bound with a showy fabric or leather band? It is conceivable that the bone sleeves from Tomb 45 and 292 represent simpler, adapted versions of these above objects. A review of Cretan finds of this category is tantalizing, but ultimately ambiguous. There are, for a start, no parallels to the large tubular handles or staves with incised chevrons or fluted sides. One 'lotus-bud' piece, however, is known from the Ida cave-sanctuary: slightly more elaborate and better worked than at Knossos, it is also cut from ivory.1407 Handles demonstrably associated with weapons have been found in tombs at Knossos (two daggers, PG) and at Liopetri (bronze knife, SM-PG), and possibly at the Psychro cave-sanctuary (iron sword).1408 The Liopetri knife, being of bronze, is arguably an actual LM-SM heirloom, but the other can be accepted as indicating the active continuation, if but poorly, into PG times of an earlier Minoan custom. There is nothing as elaborate as the Tomb 292 (£49) piece. Of the simpler bone sleeves with their incised linear pattern, there are a number on display in Heraklion Museum. They are from the area of Gypsades, Knossos, but no other details are known to me.1409 In the case of the handle in the form of standing females, a number are recorded from the cave-sanctuaries of Ida and Psychro (all argued to be PG-MG in date): all are substantially incomplete.1410 The best remains that from Psychro, but it is also the least comparable: the lower legs are lost (and so too any tenons), the hands cup the breasts, and there are hints of a hos Knossos: E no. 637 (bead); no. 199 (pendant). 1406 Psychro: Hogarth, BSA 6 (1899-1900) 113, fig. 49; Prinias: Rizza, Cron d'Arch 8 (1969) 25, pl. 13. 1 (Tomb I).

The three from Ida, on the other hand, are represented only by lower legs: two depict single figures with simple bases and tenons below; the third derives from a back-to-back two-figure piece, whose base was upheld by a palm-tree capital. The best that can be said is that the Knossos example is obviously from the same generic group. Looking further afield, any signs of ivory existing in Mainland Greece are as much a matter for enthusiastic comment as is the case for Crete. Nonetheless, Winter holds that local schools developed in the Early Iron Age at Athens, Delphi and Perachora under 'North Syrian' influence, with numerous imports from the same ultimate source at Sparta.1411 Crete, conversely, she believes, was mostly attracting goods more from Phoenician ateliers. All this had occurred by the late eighth century BC, a period when North Syria and Phoenicia were active in this and other trade-goods. None of the mainland pieces, however, show close parallels to the Cretan female figurines: it is rather in the Near East that such comparisons must be sought. The most complete set of parallels belongs to the 'Loftus Group' from Nimrud, held to have been collected in the later ninth to eighth centuries BC.1412 By reference to these, it becomes clear that Tombs 219 and 292 contained so-called staves of composite elements in this Near Eastern tradition: these will have been imports, in all likelihood. In Tomb 219, there may have been two such - the 'chevron' patterned and the 'fluted' tubes being parallel pieces, to one of which the female handle would have been attached. In Tomb 292, the chevron tube will have supported the 'lotus-bud' component, and have been capped at the other end by the rosette- knob (292. Í74 - see below), from which dangled a carrying thong. Barnett argues, with regard to the Ida material, for an undifferentiated Syrian or Phoenician origin,1413 though the 'Loftus Group' parallels given above seem to place them more in the North Syrian school. Muscarella traces the 'lotus-bud' capital to a North Syrian origin, but sees a more Phoenician influence in the nude females.1414 Winter perhaps concludes the same in that she allocates many of the Ida cave items to a Phoenician origin.1415 Whether the North Syrian or Phoenician connections are stressed is at present something of a matter for personal inclination: the first dates earlier to the late ninth to eighth century, whilst the other is perhaps eighth to late eighth century BC. In Cretan terms, this is comparable to E-MG, or M-LG. Gilding bone and ivory, using colloid gums, is a common Near Eastern practice: staining too is reported.1416 However, it has been observed at Nimrud that bone or ivory surfaces below a layer of gold foil have been purple in colour.1417 This may mean that the sword-hilt (292^49) was once gilded (as was the stave there), and not stained. The pieces gathered under the generic appellation of Attachments and Inlays are of a very mixed sort. A bone plaque J.fn) will most likely have been pegged to some backing by its central hole: the dot-and-circle motifs by which it is decorated are quite in keeping with its PG date. Later and more complex is a lathe-turned bone Pfinial, perhaps from a piece of furniture: though allocated to Tomb 40 (40. £14: SM, reused in LG-LO), it was a bulldozer find, and thus cannot be assigned with complete confidence.

From Tomb 219 comes a small ivory roundel (219. fi6), simply carved and seemingly once inlaid with blue frit or paste on top. It was attached by pegs in its sides to something else: it could do as an ornamental knob- handle or decorative inlay. The bone pieces from Tomb 292 are equally unusual: one resembles an 'eye', with a hole removed where the iris might be (292.^69), whilst the other is a domed 'rosette' knob, with incised decoration and a complex arrangement for its fixing (292. f74). As seems most likely (see above), this last will be the knob-end to a stave (292. f79) to take a carrying thong, but strictly speaking it cannot be stratigraphically linked to said item. Crete gives few examples to compare with the above: a stud or inlay from the Teke tholos (LG-EO) shares only its circular shape and peg-hole fastening device with the frit-inlaid roundel (219. fi6).1418 The 'eyes', however, whilst finding parallels at Knossos (two of ivory - PG or later), at Amnisos (four of ivory and bone - lacking a firm context) and at the Ida cave (three, including bone - PG to MG), are yet of widely varying size and not obviously associated with any surviving objects.1419 Further afield, the 'eyes' are a persistent find: they appear at Delphi (two pairs and two singletons, with recessed iris), Lindos (two, of which one is stone), Ephesus (?one), Hama (three in stone and frit) and at Hasanlu, Iran (two).1420 They are generally interpreted as belonging to statuettes, and the recessed 'iris' of pieces from Amnisos and Delphi probably supports this view. Those at Hasanlu are the earliest, dating to the late ninth century BC. If ultimately of Iranian inspiration, the 'eyes' would belong to a minor strain of imports witnessed in Crete also in openwork panels from Ida;1421 but, more likely, by the eighth century, they were common to all the Near Eastern ateliers. Carved panel-work and inlay comprised the premier work throughout all the Near East: the inlaid roundel (2 19 «fio) is but a scrap from that table. Its inlay might place it more within the Phoenician tradition than any other: but not much can be made of a single object. There remains to be mentioned but a handful of scraps of both bone and ivory from Tomb 219 (uncatalogued). These are clearly the wreck of some composite whole held together by pegs and the like: they are too fragmentary to be informative. Drawing a general conclusion from this set of material is difficult: a major review of the nature, degree and sources of the Orientalising impact on Cretan art would certainly help in the assessment.1422 Nonetheless, the N Cemetery material can be said to find echoes in the scatter of ivory and bone pieces known throughout Crete: it adds to the repertoire the stave category of objects and the use of gilding. Apart from being imported in its raw state, many of the better ivories were introduced as finished articles - from North Syrian and Phoenician centres of production ultimately.1423 Such trade extended well down into the late eighth to very early seventh centuries BC (LG to EO). 1418 Knossos: Teke tholos, 227, no. 72. 1419 Knossos: Teke tholos, 227, no. 73.

The latter are easily categorized: pins, pendants and rings for ear, finger and perhaps locks of hair. Generally the presence of silver in a tomb (e.g. J, 26, 40, 78, 229 and 292) is matched by notable grave goods of other substances, including gold jewellery, pins of iron and bronze, bronze fibulae and even imported ivory, amber and faience items. Objects of the first, baser, metal are more intractable to interpretation, being now divorced from their original contexts. The Pins (5, plus 1) fall into three types and are all fashioned from silver. The first category comprises a singleton J fy PG), with two spherical swellings at its head and in fact made from silver-coated bronze. Rather later are placed the generically related second and third varieties, being broadly contemporary. The commoner (3) of them are also the slighter: a small disc head over a biconical-swelling flanked by moulded ridges or added wire. They are found as individuals: 229.fi (?LG), 123. fi2 (EO) and 26. £5 (O). In the final form, the disc head predominates by virtue of its size: Tomb 208 (fi: O) yielded but one. To these may be added an uninformative shaft fragment from Tomb 45 (&amp;: EPG, with O reuse?). The pin types in fashion in the Cretan Early Iron Age are of an indigenous breed, and well distributed throughout the island in settlement, sanctuary and tombs alike.1425 The vast majority are of bronze, though iron, silver and even gold examples have survived: more discussion on those of metals other than silver will be found in the sections on bronze, iron and gold in this report. The variety equipped with spherical swellings is the least popular and forms a minor strain from PG to O times without any great uniformity of appearance: an EPG example from Ay. Ioannis, Knossos seems closest in appearance and date to the one from Tomb J.1426 Gilding is reported from a ?PG tomb at Kephala, and the combination of gold with silver is well attested in the pairs of bird-headed pins in the Teke tholos of arguably much the same early date.1427 The dominant species in all metals for the PG and G times is the small disc-headed type most familiar amongst the silver items here. From the unique PGB pieces in the Teke tholos down to the O ones at Arkades, there is a notable consistency of form: the most one can say is that a spherical rival to the biconical-swelling is encountered later in the G era, and that a local variety is seen in the eyed-shank types reported at Vrokastro.1428 During the O period, however, was developed the larger dominating disc-headed descendant, from which in turn even more decorative types sprang.1429 The N Cemetery examples, then, are but typical of their time. Archaeological literature has tended to interpret these pins as dress accessories rather than for the hair - a view upheld for the later sorts at least by a terracotta figurine from Praisos.1430 Whether these silver specimens acted as shroud-fasteners is not indicated by any 1424 Vacat. 1425 The basic overall appreciation of Greek pins is still Jacobsthal, Greek Pins (1956) - Crete, passim; but the mainland has come under recent review by Kilian-Dirlmeier in PBF XIII 8 (1984). Her findings - whilst concerning the Péloponnèse - may well have ramifications for Crete. 1426 Knossos: Ay.

Cocking). Whether the broken object from Tomb 119 (of later date anyway) is a stray from a nearby plundered Geometric burial is uncertain: superficially, it seems to be part of a fibula, but no good parallels seem forthcoming in Crete. Pendants are rarely encountered. The heart-shaped one from Tomb 78 (£22: LG-EO) may as easily have been sewn onto a backing as strung on a thong. Less ambiguous is that from Tomb 292 (f35); its identification as incorporating a boar's tusk is of particular interest.1431 Rings, on the other hand, are quite frequently found (6). Those of silver tend to be of LG-EO date, though since Tombs 40 and 292 have also SM and PGB interments respectively, rings of silver could well be represented earlier, which is anyway likely. The single earring (26. f6: O) is quite elaborate: an omega-shaped rod with lion's head terminals, it would require a pierced ear.1432 Altogether slighter, with a wire diameter of only 0.1 cm, is a spiral of gilded silver (78*fa6: LG-EO); conceivably intended as a hair ornament, it might just have been pressed into use as an earring. Finger-rings, of which four examples survive, are naturally sturdier: most are of plano-convex section (40.fi}; 56. £54; 78. Í2: LG-EO) with a single one of circular section (292. f26). They are all quite plain. As might be expected, finger-rings of the plainer sorts are widely-spaced in time and place, though usually made of bronze rather than a more precious metal. Silver specimens are reported from the Psychro Cave (broadly G) and from a tomb at Ay. Ioannis, Knossos (E-MPG).1433 Spiral wire forms are known in general G contexts from Psychro (of gold) and at Vrokastro (of bronze): the identification of the last as a finger-ring is proven by the presence of the appropriate bones within it.1434 Passing to the baser metal of Lead, the firmly placed articles (4) fall into two main groups, largely from Tomb 292. Two of these (292. Í7, 13a) are termed in the catalogue 'rod and cover': essentially they consist of one or two lead wires encased in a broken fragment of bronze sheet. They look very much like sections from a reinforced rim of a bronze vessel, though not from the single bronze phiale (£56, 46, 78) there recorded. The other pair (292.fioa; 287^5: LPG-PGB) resemble small strip hinges, and - to judge from their shape - were once threaded on to a line or rod. Neither bears any marks to suggest that it was attached to another substance, and so they may have been utilized solely for their weight - but in what capacity is not known. Finally comes a stray find from the neighbourhood of Tomb 75 (G-O): a circular sheet, with a pattern of five dots in an enclosing line on one face. It might be a weight. There seem no contemporary parallels for those objects, which is no doubt but an accident of discovery; that lead was utilized at this period in the Knossos region can be demonstrated by the figurines recently unearthed at the sanctuary of Iuktas. Objects of Amber (fig. 184) Beads are the main class represented here. Great numbers occur in Tomb 18 (£6, 7, 8, 9), many of them in a fragmentary condition: some forty beads can be accounted for, all quite 1431 Compare similar teeth in Hogarth, Excavations, pl. 42, 21 and 23, from Ephesus: also lacking identification. 1432 For such earrings generally, Higgins, GRJ 10b ti. ot O date. 1433 Psychro: CCO 40 no. 63, pl. 14, fig. 17, and 39 for others in Herakleion Museum; Knossos: Ay.

Spheres, flat lentoids, cylinders and plano-convex shapes are found in roughly equal proportions: a necklace is their most likely function. Similar beads turn up in ones and twos from a handful of other tombs (78.fl6b, 19, 29: LG-EO; 82.fi: LO; 104. f2, 7: EG; 22g. fô9 7: LG). Their broad spread throughout the G and O periods is obvious. Noteworthy too is the association of amber with rock crystal (18. Í2; 78.föa, 17, 23; 229. f8) and with faience or glass (78.1$ especially). In Tomb 218 a gold and amber pin (fi2: MG) was revealed. Interestingly, other finds of amber are recorded almost only in the region of Knossos, where it has been recovered from two other cemeteries. At Teke, it plays a minor role in the complex inlaid gold jewellery assigned to PGB times. Later, in MG and LG, its usage is confined to beads like those in the N Cemetery: some numbers occur in Tomb X, Fortetsa.1435 In the same period, the occasional sealstone was fashioned from it, as seen at Arkades.1436 From this evidence, it may surely be deduced that amber, like ivory and perhaps rock crystal, was an imported luxury article, and one whose concentration around Knossos must serve to underline the continuing role of the area as a centre of premier rank in Crete. Elsewhere in Greece, finds of amber are scarcely made down into the ninth century BC, but pick up sharply in the eighth century: a situation exactly comparable to the Cretan.1437 Objects of Perishable Materials (plate 312) Given the predominant custom of cremation practised in this cemetery, it is not surprising to encounter in the burials pieces of carbonized or partly burnt Wood. Samples from a dozen tombs, covering the entire PG to O periods, were large enough to warrant collection and traces of even more are referred to in the Excavation day books. Where sufficient of the charcoal or wood remain, the fragments generally declare themselves to be drawn from the pyre-fuel in that they are apparently segments of untrimmed branches (Tombs 219, 285). In one case only (219.^155) is there even a remote suggestion of deliberate shaping: a disc, and maybe a fragment of a thin-walled vessel. Tomb L could add a thin lath (f. 2), if it is not intrusive. Other Vegetable remains were recovered: olive pips from three tombs (19, several: LG-LO; 57, one: EO-LO; loy.fyj, two: O pithos); a fruit with a kernel (M.f2: PGB-LG); and many thousands of fenugreek seeds (229, uncatalogued; in LG vessel). Finally come a few score of carbonized cereal grains, probably barley, albeit in a disturbed pyre (3io.f7, 8: G, with HL and R burials). The fenugreek seeds, at least, are a deliberate deposit. Similar symbolism can be sought in the Eggshells that have turned up in seven tombs (34«*3O5 56*^74; 82 uncatalogued; 182 uncatalogued; 2ig.f56a and 294. fig), none certainly earlier than the O period. Though it is analytically impossible to identify beyond doubt the bird from which they came, a hen would not be improbable.1438 Finally there are the Seashells and related items of marine creatures: the scatter of the former displays no recognisably significant concentrations. They include Spiny Oyster (4O.fi8), Peppery Furrow (56: EO-LO), Limpet (60), two Murex species (75: O; 104), Dentalium (ioo.f28b: 1435 Knossos: Teke tholos 26c; ff: F. no. ^6a ho niecesV 1436 Arkades: Levi, AJA 49 (1945) 314, fig. 24b. 1437 Higgins in Lefliandi I 223, for an abbreviated appreciation of this point; also Hughes-Brock, Amber in Archaeology, 220-1 for a LBA perspective. 1438 Though note, in Teke tholos 216, what is identified as an ostrich egg.

Of more interest are beads or pendants fashioned from elasmobranch (ray or shark) vertebrae (75.Í28; 285. Í2o) and even from a fossil shell (285. fi 8). Such fossils are common finds amongst the kouskouras of the Knossos region. It is noticeable that these tantalizingly fragmentary pieces of evidence have a tendency to appear in tombs where a later G or O presence is strong, if not dominant. Are they witness, albeit rather obliquely, of new elements in funerary customs, perhaps involving the deposition of such as fruits, cereals and eggs that carried some symbolic significance; or, perhaps, being remains of foods partaken at the burial ceremony?1439 Objects of a Later Date (plates 305, 308) Given the extensive use of the same general areas for HL, R and ECh funerary activities, accompanied at times by looting, it is hardly surprising to discover that objects dating from over a millennium later have found their way into the G and O tombs. Items derived from large pieces oí Architecture or Statuary are rare: two Pcolumn fragments (34^23; 292.f76). Rather more prevalent are bits of stone inlay and veneer, mouldings and mosaic tesserae: much perhaps deriving from the nearby Basilica Church of the fifth century AD. Tombs 24, 30, 79, 126, 208, 287, 292 and 306 all yielded an item of this sort: none is of any intrinsic interest. Vastly more numerous are pieces from Glass vessels. Almost half of the eighty or so Early Iron Age tombs contained a few such fragments, and on rare occasions (e.g. Tomb 100) the score reaches up into the dozens. The commonest are pieces from the wall of a vessel, usually coated in an iridescent coat of corrosion products and revealing a wide range of colours and calibres. With such must be taken the glass mosaic tesserae (Tombs 13, 48, 55, 100, 208, 283 and 310): their source is almost certainly the extensive wall mosaics known to have adorned the Basilica Church mentioned above. Lastly, and dating roughly to the Turkish period are parts of Clay Pipes for smoking tobacco (14. f2; 283.fi, and near to 126). They follow the same overall pattern and general proportion, consisting of a small bowl and a short stem ending in a collar. All are decorated with a variety of geometric patterns put on by stamp and roulette wheel. Clearly a stem or tube of another substance was inserted into the collar. Their similarity in size, shape and decorative techniques and motifs declare that such items were being manufactured under standardized, maybe even factory, conditions.1440 1439 Boardman and Kurtz, Greek Burial Customs (1971) 66 for the sort of finds made in Athenian cemeteries.

Catling This chapter attempts to define the SM period in terms of the N Cemetery evidence itself, to set that against what was previously known of the period at Knossos, and to relate it to its wider context in the Early Dark Ages. The earliest burials mark the beginning of the SM period. There is disagreement over the status of the site beforehand: in my view, it was a virgin site, where no previous burials had been made. I do not believe that any of the chamber tombs were opened before the SM period. I do not believe that any of them had once contained LM III A-C burials and offerings, which were subsequently cleaned out for SM or, later, PG use. As will be argued in more detail below, the tomb plans are poorly matched in the LM series, but are close to the Dark Age series from the Fortetsa cemetery. The only Minoan objects found (apart from one or two gems, and insignificant numbers of battered pottery fragments), are five painted larnakes and eleven others, undecorated. I believe that these were recovered from elsewhere and re-used. The argument that they are too cumbersome to have been brought from any distance is unconvincing; LM people managed to move their clay larnakes from their place of manufacture to their place of use, and there is no ground for supposing that DA Knossians were incapable of transporting heavy loads. I do not believe that the SM-PG-G users of the cemetery (had most of the chambers pre-existed as LM tombs) would really have troubled to have swept away all trace of such previous LM burials, not only from the individual tomb chambers but from the dromoi as well - indeed, from the entire area of the cemetery. Nor is it credible that the post-Minoan users would, first, have located every single M tomb on the site, and second, would have found every one in sufficiently good condition (roof, doorway, dromos sides) for cleaning and reuse. There are examples in the Knossos area of LM chamber tombs reused in SM times. The clearest is the Ay. Ioannis tomb published by M. S. F. Hood and J. N. Coldstream1441 where the tomb itself was undoubtedly of LM design, and the earliest burial remains were of LM II or LM III A date; the SM burials overlay these in clear juxtaposition. Gypsades T. VII1442 contained a LM III painted larnax and a large SM group. Hood, the excavator, says of this find 'The larnax . . . may be earlier than the tomb itself and the objects found in it. It contained the remains of a skeleton, but no grave goods except for an interesting iron knife with bronze rivets . . .'. Twenty-one tombs may, with varying degrees of confidence, be attributed to the SM period, namely: 1441 BSA 63 (1968), 205-18. •"2 BSA 53-54 (1958-59), 205-08.</page><page sequence="352">64o H. W.

There are three types of grave. Pit-caves- Ts. ?98*, 186, 200+, ??2o8 Shaft-graves - Ts. 149, 153, 160, 282 Chamber-tombs - Ts. 2, 16, 18, 24, 40*, 45, 48, 56, 112, 121, 207*, F/67I5*, F/67:i4 The pit-caves 186, 200-2 are of great importance for their undisturbed condition and, relatively, rich contents. They are modest constructions in themselves, consisting of square, or nearly square pits cut into stereo, some 1.80 X 1.00 in the case of T. 186, 1.34 X 1.34 for Ts. 200+ . The pits were straight-sided, the floors cut level. From low down in the wall to floor level, centred in the wall, one (T. 186), or three (Ts. 200+) small chambers were cut into the face, their floors a few centimetres deeper than the floor of the pit. The largest (T. 200) is 0.65 deep, 0.60 wide and 0.55 high. The opening is sealed either by a single stone slab (Ts. 186, 200, 202) or by a larger and a smaller slab (T 201). After completion of the burial rite, the shafts were refilled with kouskouras probably upcast from cutting the pits. The pit-fill of T. 186 was clean; the fill of Ts. 200-202 included a large patch of ash-blackened earth, flecks of charcoal and fragments of a neck-handled amphora. Ts. 186, 200, and 201 contained loose cremations and a variety of grave offerings. Save a tiny scrap of cremated bone, T. 202 was empty. Nothing was found on the shaft-floor of T. 186; two stirrup jars were on the floor of Ts. 200+ , one in the NE corner, one in the SE. If T. 98 was originally a pit-cave, it was much larger than Ts. 186, 200+, at 2.86 X 2.40. No chamber remained; if the identification were correct, it has to be assumed that the chamber had been destroyed when the dromos of T. 156 was cut. More tentative still is the identification of T. 208 as an erstwhile pit-cave. The shaft would have been 1.30 X 1.65; the blocking stone, off-centre, had no chamber behind it. The grave had been so thoroughly disturbed that nothing is certain. Of the four shaft-graves (Ts. 149, 153, 160, 282), only T. 160 can be positively identified as SM, from the stirrup jar found in it, the only offering. T. 153 had no offerings, Ts. 149 and 282 were disturbed. The grave type in each case, however, is so similar, and distinctive, that a SM date for all four is very probable. A pit approximately rectangular (T 282) or trapezoidal (Ts. 149, 153, 160) was cut into stereo. In no case is the depth below ground surface known. Within the compass of this pit a smaller one was dug to a greater depth to receive a single inhumed burial. The outer pits varied from 1.84 X 1.0 (T. 282) to 1.38 X 1.08 (T. 153), the inner pits from 1.38 X 0.86 to 1. 15 X 0.62. Once the body had been laid in the inner pit, it was covered by at least three stone slabs laid side-by-side athwart the inner pit, resting on the ledges created by digging the inner pit. The main pit was then refilled, presumably with the upcast from its construction. The bodies had been placed on their backs, with their legs drawn up, heads at the N to NE end of the grave. The stirrup jar in T. 160 was placed above the left shoulder. The thirteen chamber-tombs, poorly preserved though many of them were, are relatively uniform in plan. In most cases the roofs had been destroyed and the stomion and blocking walls were seriously damaged. Much of the dromos in each case had been destroyed by erosion. The basic design is composed of an entrance passage (dromos) whose width varies between 0.85 and</page><page sequence="353">THE SUBMINOAN PHASE IN THE NORTH CEMETERY AT KNOSSOS 641 1.48 as between one tomb and another, lengths varying from a maximum of 5.85 to a minimum of 2.30, the average amounting to 3.50. Eight of the thirteen tombs have dromoi between 2 and 4 m long. In plan, most tombs chambers are of rather irregular bulbous plan, in eight cases wider than they are deep, the remainder the reverse. In several cases (Ts. 2, 16, 40, 112, 121) chambers are not much wider than their dromoi. In T. 207, however, the chamber was substantially wider than the dromos - 2.20 to 0.85 m. The damaged chamber of T. 48 was at least 2.70 wide to the 1.20 m of the dromos; the chamber may have been even wider, but the intrusion of the basilica wall makes this uncertain. Only Ts. 24 and 207 preserved their roofs almost complete; the former was domed in section, up to 1.38 high, while the latter was almost wedge-shaped in section, height up to 1.0 m. What remained of the roofs of Ts. 2 and 18 suggest they had also been wedge-shaped in section, while Ts. 16 and 56 had probably been domed. In general, the N Cemetery SM chamber tombs most closely resemble the design of the tombs in the Fortetsa cemetery1443 in the shape of the chambers and their size relative to the whole tomb - dromos, stomion, and chamber. Only T 112 has a chamber of angular plan that in any way recalls the LM Zapher Papoura series,1444 for example, or those at Isopata.1445 Nor are our tombs like the different design of the LM chamber tombs at Kalyvia, Phaistos.1446 The size and arrangement of the SM cemetery is of interest. With the exception of the shaft-grave T. 282, an outlier in the N sector of the cemetery, and the outliers F/67I5 and 14 well away to the south-west, all the graves are concentrated in the main group of tombs on the S side of the site, covering a roughly triangular area 58m E-w, 40 m N-S. Of these, Ts. 207 and 48 are W outliers, T. 18 an E outlier, T 2 a S outlier. The major concentration of the remaining fourteen SM tombs occupies an area 24 m E-W, 26 m N-S, which includes all the pit-caves, three of the four shaft-graves and seven (54%) of the chamber-tombs. Within this concentration, all the pit-caves occupy a space 8 m E-W by 8 m N-S at the S side of the group. The three shaft-graves are roughly in an E-W line 6 m in extent, at the NE side of the group. The seven chamber-tombs lie in an area 20 m E-W by 13 N-S. It is tempting to try to interpret this cemetery's topography, but the evidence is slender, and there must be at least the suspicion that the later use of the cemetery may have removed all trace of some SM tombs (pit-caves and shaft graves) and obscured the fact that other chamber tombs may have originated in the SM period. As it is, it seems that the SM families (or groups, to use a more neutral term) who cremated their dead separated themselves from those who inhumed, though by no great distance. The remarkable concentration of graves represented by the Ts. 98-106-152-163-168 interlocking group of tombs raises a suspicion - it can be no more - that this point in the cemetery was particularly attractive because of the status of the grave near which so many people later strove to bury their dead. If that were so, there are three candidates for the 'master' grave - Ts. 40 (N of the complex), 98 (part of the complex) and 200+ (to the s). As we have seen, the status of T. 98 is uncertain; in its favour for the 'master' role is its immediate proximity to the cluster. T. 40 's candidature rests on proximity, rather than any intrinsic factor. T. 200+ , from its contents must be among the very earliest burials in the cemetery; the richness of those contents suggests those buried in it had been prominent within their community. The matter cannot usefully be argued beyond this point. 1443 E tomb plans, especially T. Pi and T. VI, pl. 131 and 133 respectively. 1444 E.g.

Such evidence as there is may be summarised: Pit-caves 98 (In the SM level). Remains of unburnt limbs. 186 Cremation (in bag?) of one individual. 200 Cremation (in bag?) of one individual. 201 Cremation (in bag(s)?) of two individuals and a child. 202 Cenotaph (apart from a scrap of cremated bone). 208 Very disturbed. Cremated and unburnt remains. Shaft-graves 149 Inhumation (disturbed - young mature male). 153 Inhumation (adult, 25-35 years). 160 Inhumation (male, 'past the prime of life'). 282 Completely pillaged - two scraps of burnt bone. Chamber- tombs 2 Limb bones from an inhumation (chamber). Inurned cremation (Pot 1) of an ?adult female. 16 Single inhumation of an adult, age unknown. 18 Confused - small lots of burnt and unburnt bones. 40 Confused - no identifiable cremation or inhumation found with the SM group, though small lots of burnt and unburnt bone found in the fill. 45 All bone found was unburnt; no burial in situ. 56 Very much disturbed. Some lots of burnt and unburnt bone. Specific cremation, perhaps of a male. 112 Inhumation, adult 25-35 years. 121 Three inhumations:- I (final), male perhaps not more than 35. Laid on back, with head on w side of chamber, twisting over to left, legs drawn up, hands over pelvis. II (swept up) ?Female, perhaps under 25. III (swept up) Child, under 6. 207 Much disturbed. Two groups of unburnt bone. F/67:5 Disturbed. Trace of unburnt child burial. F/67:i4 Disturbed. Burnt and unburnt bone. Thus, Ts. 16, 112, and 121 contained inhumations in situ, single in 16 and 112, multiple in 121, where the evidence of swept-up burials points to use on at least two occasions. There was certainly an inhumation in T. 2, but an in-urned cremation had been placed in the aromos. Could this, in fact, be of post-SM identity? T. 45 had probably contained an inhumation; there were no signs of cremation, at least. Evidence for both inhumations and cremations came from Ts. 18, 40, 48, and 56, all of which certainly continued in use during the post-SM period. The evidence suggests that inhumation may have been the normal SM means of disposing of the dead, but that the two well preserved pit-caves make it certain that a section of the community, at least, cremated. In general terms, the three types of SM grave have their equivalents at Knossos in the LM period. Pit-caves, described by Pini as Schachtnischengraber^1 but on a much larger scale, were a prominent feature of the Zapher Papoura cemetery, where eighteen examples were found, 1447 Pini, Beiträge zur minoischen Gräberkunde (Wiesbaden, 1968), 46.</page><page sequence="355">THE SUBMINOAN PHASE IN THE NORTH CEMETERY AT KNOSSOS 643 with pits up to 4.35 m deep, and the 'cave' large enough to receive an extended inhumed body.1448 The caves were sealed with two thicknesses of dry-stone walling before the refilling of the shaft. LM pit-caves have been identified, with varying degrees of confidence, in other parts of the Knossos area (Hospital site, Upper Gypsades, and a site E of the Temple Tomb1449). There are a few examples outside Crete, in Attica at Markopoulo, in the Argolis at Nauplia, Phriphtiani, Tiryns, and Argos.1450 An EPG example is reported from the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens.1451 The grave-type may have travelled as far as Cyprus, where it has been provisionally identified at Alaas and Lapithos.1452 Shaft-graves were also well represented in the Zapher Papoura cemetery, where 33 examples were excavated by Evans, whose description of the distinguishing features is very clear: ... a shaft or pit leading down to the slabbed covering of the actual sepulchral cell. The cell here, however, is a simple cavity in the rock made somewhat narrower than the rock above so as to leave a ledge for the support of the covering slabs. These Zapher Papoura graves were much larger that ours, with shafts of 2.0 to 3.5 m deep, and the graves themselves adding up to another metre in depth. Rarely, grave goods were placed on top of the cover slabs, as well as in the grave.1453 Pini lists shaft-graves from the Knossos area at Ayios Ioannis, Hospital Site, Mavro Spelio, a site E of the Temple Tomb, Upper Gypsades, and at Sellopoulo.1454 The grave type is more widely distributed beyond Knossos than the pit-cave, but is still not a common type. Of the examples listed by Pini, a majority dates from LM III B, or later. The practice of burial in chamber-tombs was widespread in Crete throughout the LM period, and was particularly well represented at Knossos. This fact is of more importance to the present inquiry than a finer analysis of the considerable range of variation in chamber- tomb plan and method of use. Given the special circumstances of the Dark Ages in Crete it is difficult not to try to see in the arrangement and diversity of the SM tombs in the N Cemetery symptoms of change, of the presence of intrusive elements in the population, and the establishment of new overseas links. The best evidence for change comes from the start of the cemetery itself. We have seen it was a new site, untouched by Minoan use. It has proved the largest burial ground of the period yet known at Knossos, though other burials were made during the same period at a number of points at some distance from this main centre. We may note Tombs Via and VII at Upper Gypsades, 2 km to the SSE; Fortetsa Tomb Pi, 150 m SSE, Fortetsa Tomb VI (see pp. 308-09) almost a kilometre due S; Ay. Ioannis (re-used LM II tomb) 750m due N, and in the reused Kephala ridge tholos tomb, almost a kilometre to the NE. Doubtless there are more. Where the evidence is clear, all these peripheral SM burials seem to have been inhumations, either in newly cut chamber tombs (Upper Gypsades T. VII), or as reuse of Minoan built tombs (Kephala ridge tholos) and chamber tombs (the Ay. Ioannis reused tomb). There is no certain case of SM cremation beyond the N Cemetery. 1448 pTK. fig. 79. 1449 Pini, op. cit. 82-5, collects the references. 1450 Pini, op. cit. 46, and n. w6. 1451 Kerameikos IV, 47, no. 2, an inhumation associated with an iron sword. 1452 Catling, in The Apes of Homer (iqqO, h«. 1453 pTJC figs. 10, 52, 53 (the Chieftain's Grave). 1454 Pini, op. cit. 82-5 has collected the references.</page><page sequence="356">644 H- w- CATLING The relationship between the LM pit-caves, used exclusively for inhumations, and their much smaller SM versions, used, it seems, exclusively for cremations, is very difficult to determine. It might be argued that there is no relationship, and that the resemblances are coincidental. I should prefer to suppose there is a link between the two versions as yet not understood. The location of settlement in the Knossos area in the Dark Ages has been fully discussed by Hood in the light of his unrivalled knowledge of the ancient topography of the region.1455 While he accepts that there may have been one or two outlying areas of occupation corresponding to the more distant cemeteries (of which Ay. Ioannis is the clearest instance), he is strongly in favour of a main centre of habitation in the neighbourhood of the erstwhile Palace from at least EPG. He points to SM finds w of the Palace, up to and including the area behind the Stratigraphie Museum. He suggests that the SM cult in the Spring Chamber S of the Palace may have been outside the area of settlement. If the Stratigraphie Museum is taken as the notional centre of such SM occupation, it would place the N Cemetery a kilometre distant from the centre, to the NW. For comparison, the LM Zapher Papoura cemetery lies a kilometre N of the Palace. It is probably futile in the present state of knowledge to look for evidence of positive association between the SM use of the N Cemetery and any particular area of SM habitation in the Knossos area, for what is known is extremely fragmentary, and the possibility of undiscovered habitation sites, perhaps in Fortetsa itself, cannot be entirely discounted. What kind of people do we find in the SM community of the N Cemetery? For the most part their remains and burial offerings tell us relatively little, apart from the obvious fact of the co-existence within the community of three clearly differentiated methods of disposing of the dead, something, as we have seen, not in itself new to Knossos. The selection of vases, and their presumed contents, buried with the dead may variously be interpreted as offerings to the dead from the living, or as a response to a perceived need by the dead at some point following their burial. It would be difficult to relate these burial goods, their size and quality, to any preconceived theory of social hierarchy, in view of the small size of the sample and the even smaller number of burials where the association between individuals and their burial goods is unequivocal. Such an approach is made even more subjective by the considerable uncertainty about the sequence of graves and the possibility that, with the passage of time, ideas changed about the extent and character of the goods that should be placed with the dead. T. 16 and T. 112, small chamber-tombs, apparently with single inhumations, each contained three vases. T. 1 6 had a stirrup jar and two cups, T. 112 two stirrup jars and a belly-handled amphora. Does this degree of diversity signal that their community viewed these individuals in different ways? Perhaps so, but interpretation is virtually impossible given that the sex of neither could be identified, and that only one (T. 112) could be even approximately aged. The most promising of the inhumations is T. 121, where seven vases, two bronze arched fibulae, and a faience bead were found. The arrangement of the vases suggested that five of the seven may have belonged to the earlier burials (woman and child) and that a flask and stirrup jar had been placed with the final burial, probably a man. It is tempting, then, to suppose that the second flask and second stirrup jar were originally for the woman, and that the three rather unusual shapes - thelastron, small oinochoe, handmade vase - were for the i«5 AS*, !6-i8.</page><page sequence="357">THE SUBMINOAN PHASE IN THE NORTH CEMETERY AT KNOSSOS 645 child. The two fibulae were with the swept-up remains: the bead could have belonged to any of the three. The only comparable group is T. 40, with its twelve vases. Unfortunately, there is nothing to show to how many burials these were attached; one vase, anyway, was widely separated from the main group, and has to be discounted. Four stirrup jars and three flasks in T. 40 recall the two stirrup jars and two flasks of T. 121; there was a small oinochoe in both. But T. 40 has a cup, neck-handled amphora, and a single shoulder-handled amphora missing in T. 121. The distinction is probably not chronological, for the flasks in both tombs are very close to one another in form and decoration. T. 40 is larger than T. 121; its burial goods include larger vases than T. 121. Is this evidence for a different social status for the occupants of the two tombs, or for different customs among the two groups of people who attended their dead? By extension, what is to be said of the status and attitudes of those who were buried alone in the four shaft-graves? There are many ways in which the difference between them and the chamber-tombs might be rationalised; the differences could be of status, of wealth, of ethnic origin, of marital condition, for example. We cannot, in our present state of knowledge, penetrate this conundrum; suffice it to recognize its existence. Two pit-graves, 186 and 200+, offer more varied information through their relatively rich grave groups, information that not only seems to clothe their dead with more tangible personalities than can be attached to the occupants of the other graves, but to suggest connections beyond Knossos - indeed, far beyond Crete itself. There is much that is uncertain about some of the contents, particularly of T. 201, and it is hoped that future study of this material will permit a much more sophisticated appraisal of its significance. Pit-cave T. 186 contained, in its single 'cave', an undisturbed cremation associated with a stirrup jar, an iron dirk, a large bronze spearhead; an iron knife with bronze rivets, two honing stones, and a (very crushed) bronze phalaron, with prominent spike. Though it is not certain, this phalaron may well have been used as a shield boss. Here is a warrior's equipment, that recalls an almost contemporary inhumation burial in a cist grave at Tiryns, T. XXVIII of the series excavated by N. Verdelis.1456 Two skeletons were found, of which one, a woman's, lacked offerings. With the second burial, a male, were a SMyc stirrup jar, two iron dirks, a bronze spearhead, a bronze phalaron with elaborate spike, and the remains of the bronze facings of what has been identified as a helmet. With one exception, T. XXVIII was the earliest grave in the cemetery. The parallel with the T. 186 assemblage, though far from exact, is close enough to suggest there could be some common factor. Pit-cave 200+ was also undisturbed. Of its three 'caves' (Ts. 200, 201, 202) T. 200, in addition to the loose cremation, contained goods appropriate to a woman - an ivory comb, a necklace of 80 solid gold beads, other beads of glass and paste, a bronze wheel-shaped pin- head, two (damaged) leaf-gold rosettes, and a gold finger-ring. There was also a large stirrup jar. T 201 was the most prolific in the number and diversity of its finds. It was, again, the grave of a warrior, among whose cremated remains found loose were a bronze Type II sword (in four pieces), a fragmentary bronze spearhead, six large bronze arrowheads, a very damaged bronze phalaron with short spike, two pieces of slim iron shaft, and the very fragmentary remains of a bronze four-sided ajouré stand. Study of the cremated bone showed that there had been taken up with it by the excavator a series of triangular and rectangular 1456 AM 78 (1963), 10 ff.</page><page sequence="358">646 H. W. CATLING bone inlays, a fragmentary decorated ivory handle for a weapon or tool, and the remains of several slices of boar's tusk with traces of stitch holes, very probably once part of a boar's tusk helmet. Dr. Musgrave's study of the exceptionally large quantity of cremated bone in T. 201 suggests that it comprises the remains of two adults, perhaps one male, the other female, and probably a child as well. The remains in T. 200 were of one individual, perhaps female - an identification which gains strength, as we have seen, from the character of the grave goods in that tomb. The two, or three, individuals of T. 201 could well have been cremated simultaneously, on a common pyre. It is, indeed, possible, (for there is no sign of the re-digging of the pit-fill) that the three 'caves' were sealed simultaneously, and that the bodies of three adults and a child had been cremated on a single occasion, two adults and a child on one pyre, a third adult on a second. The original intention might have been to place the remains of each adult in a separate 'cave'. When the time came, it proved impossible to distinguish the remains of those who had been burnt on a common pyre, and they were accordingly buried together. There was no role for T. 202, though a scrap of cremated bone got into it in the process of sealing this cenotaph. There is probably further confirmation of the presence of two adults in T. 201 in the two large stirrup jars in the NE and SE corners of the pit, either side, that is, of the entrance to the 'cave'. The evidence of Ts. 186 and 200 suggest such stirrup jars may have been standard grave goods according to this rite; there may have been no room for them in the little 'cave'-chamber and they were accordingly placed outside. The warrior of T. 201 was fully armed with sword, spear, and massive arrowheads. The phalaron suggests he also had a shield. He probably had a helmet of very special type. He had had some complex object, at present unidentifiable, to which the bone inlays had belonged. And he had possessed an intricate bronze openwork stand. I first thought the two pieces of iron shaft had originally been part of one and the same object, and supposed it might have been a predecessor of the later iron spits. I now think Professor Snodgrass' identification of a pair of iron pins that have lost both heads and tips is persuasive. If so, these may have belonged to the woman. Our warrior was a flamboyant figure, in the light of his possessions - at least, in terms of the Greek Dark Ages. I believe he is a figure for whom analogies can be found in Homer, and for whom there are parallels in other archaeological discoveries. Though there are many points of difference, and the points of similarity should not be pressed too strongly, I am reminded of the exceptional LC III B grave group Kaloriziki T. 40. 1457 Though this tomb had a very chequered history, having been partly pillaged early this century, what remained was identified and excavated 50 years later by G. H. McFadden, and the essential facts are clear. It originally contained two cremations, separately inurned in two bronze amphorae, one of which was certainly female, one, by inference, male. The grave goods were of great richness, including the gold and cloisonné sceptre head, a gold pin, two fine bronze tripod stands with legs embellished with animal protomes, a bronze spearhead, and a complex of objects (three bronze phalara, one with prominent spike; lengths of flat bronze strip, and some pieces of sheet with pointillé ornament) that I have elsewhere suggested may have been the facings of a shield. There was also a good deal of pottery. Kaloriziki T. 40 is approximately contemporary with our T. 200+ and T. 186. So, too, is •«7 AJA 58 (1954), 131fr.</page><page sequence="359">THE SUBMINOAN PHASE IN THE NORTH CEMETERY AT KNOSSOS 647 Tiryns T. XXVIII which, I have suggested, has a good deal in common with T. 186. There is a link between Tiryns T. XXVIII and Kaloriziki T. 40. Not only do both tombs contain phalara with prominent spikes, but the sheet bronze in both tombs (helmet facings at Tiryns, shield facings at Kaloriziki) is decorated in the same distinctive pointillé technique. Kaloriziki T. 40 is linked with T. 201 through the rite of cremation and the elaborate bronze stands in each grave. Spiked phalara are common to both. In however fragile a fashion, it is possible to discern a link between Knossos, Tiryns, and Kaloriziki. To interpret that link is, of course, another matter. The boar's tusk helmet in T. 201 is, potentially, the most remarkable find from the grave, for it provides a perfect illustration to Iliad X, 261 ff, where Odysseus arms for a foray, and dons such a helmet, which is then described, in one of the most (archaeologically) celebrated passages in the poems. For our present purpose, the greatest interest attaches to its pedigree {supra p. 534). The helmet type, whose origins go back to the Middle Bronze Age, has been found in many Helladic and Minoan contexts, and warriors wearing such helmets appear quite frequently in Aegean representational art.1458 By the lifetime of our Knossian warrior, however, the boar's tusk helmet had been long obsolete, and he could only have obtained it by that mechanism of heirloom transmission which is described in the Homeric passage quoted above. In my view, the bronze stand burnt with the T. 201 warrior on his pyre should also have been an heirloom, at least 100 years old at the time (though I am aware that there are dissenting views on the question of the chronology of the bronze stands).1459 I suggest that both helmet and bronze stand came to the occupant of T 201 in gift exchange of the kind of which we hear a good deal in the Odyssey. I take as an example the munificence of Menelaos to the departing Telemachus (Odyssey IV, 615-19). . . . you shall have the loveliest and most precious of the treasures that my palace holds. I'll give you a mixing bowl of wrought metal. It is solid silver with a rim of gold around the top ... I had it from my royal friend, the King of Sidon, when I put up under his roof on my journey home. I am arguing that the warriors of Ts. 186 and 201 may best be understood against the background of the Nostoi, and it need not surprise us if we find elements in common among warrior burials widely separated in location, but approximately contemporary. The warriors of the N Cemetery might have been ethnic Cretans who had travelled widely in disturbed times, eventually to return to their former homes for a fresh start in a world changed out of recognition since their departure. Or they may have been of wholly alien stock, from that cosmopolitan world with which, for instance, Cyprus must have been peopled as the Late Cypriot period came to its close. Fifty years or so afterwards, another striking figure was buried in flamboyant style in Euboea, in the Dark Age building at Toumba, Lefkandi.1460 He provides a striking link with Kaloriziki T. 40, for his cremated remains were consigned to a bronze amphora with decorated rim and handles of precisely the same class as the two used as ash urns in the Cypriot tomb. The Lefkandi warrior's ashes were found wrapped in a remarkable textile; the large number of bronze fibulae found in one of the 1458 J. Borchhardt, Homerische Helme (Mainz, 1972), 18-37. A.

CATLING Kalorìziki urns may mean that cremation was similarly wrapped. I have also made some of the points discussed in 'Heroes Returned? Subminoan Burials from Crete', in The Ages of Homer. We have seen that the N Cemetery is a new burial ground, and that Ts. 186 and 200+ are among its earliest graves; it is interesting that Tiryns T. XXVIII is said to be only the second grave in that cemetery, and that at Kaloriziki, T. 40 is one of the first graves. Another burial ground in Cyprus which may have a similar start in the early Dark Age is Palaepaphos- Skales1*61 where there are one or two abnormally rich burials at the start of the cemetery's history.1462 I have suggested one or two links between Knossos and Cyprus, of which T. 201 's bronze stand may be the most convincing. Cyprus may well have been the source from which came the set of bronze projectiles ('arrowheads') in T. 201. These are quite unlike the flimsy arrow plates used by Mycenaean and Minoan archers1463 and point to the finds of such weapons at several sites in Cyprus from the twelfth century onwards. Many were found in the settlement at Enkomi, others were in the Ayia Anastasia tombs at Lapithos, and there was a set of four in the LC III B-CG I T. 1 at Salamis.1464 Such arrowheads are also well distributed in the contemporary Near East. Again, the two gold rosettes, very stylized, from T. 200 could have come from Cyprus. Though such rosettes are, of course, reminiscent of Aegean funerary jewellery,1465 and could be of local origin, they recall similar rosettes from Salamis T. i, and others from early Dark Age tombs at Lapithos. A Cypriot origin would be acceptable for the ivory comb in T. 200; combs of this type are known from Palaepaphos and Enkomi, though 50-100 years earlier than ours.1466 Obviously it is absurd to try to redraw the picture of SM Crete on the strength of two grave groups. Nevertheless, Ts. 186 and 200+ at the N Cemetery encourage fresh thinking about the period. P. M. Warren, in his preliminary account of his excavation of the Stratigraphie Museum Extension Site at Knossos, discussing his evidence for SM settlement, makes the important statement '. . . while the twelfth and eleventh centuries were disturbed enough to bring about cities of refuge in high, relatively inaccessible locations, they were not so disturbed as to prevent substantial settlement of the traditional and chief lowland centres.' That contrast is, perhaps, the key to understanding SM Crete, for it tacitly recognizes a dichotomy between those for whom fear for their safety was the paramount consideration in their choice of home, and those sufficiently untroubled to live in the open conditions of Knossos and enjoy the economic and social advantages of so doing. We may have fallen into the unwarranted assumption that there was a single society in early Dark Age Crete united in the face of the tribulations by which it had been afflicted, the continued threat of which permanently conditioned its behaviour. The N Cemetery evidence suggests that during at least early SM, the inhabitants of the Knossos area were heterogeneous. A proportion may have been survivors and descendants of the old Minoan stock, but it is likely that there were new elements among them, people from 1461 Shahs. 1462 Especially Ts. 49 and 58, op. cit. 59-76, figs. 83-90, especially figs. 88-9, and 112-25, %s- 101-16, especially 115. 14*3 H-G.

Newcomers may have forced their leadership on the native population; it may have been their choice to open new burial grounds, the N Cemetery among them. I suggest the warriors whose ashes were buried in Ts. 186 and 201 may have been such newcomers, set apart from the autochthonous population by their funerary customs, particularly the rite of cremation. It may have been newcomers of this kind who were responsible for the divided character of the island's settlement pattern, men whose aggression and ambition drove other communities into the safety of the hills, permanently exacerbating relations between one major settlement and another within Crete. Mutatis mutandis, such an early Dark Age settlement pattern may have been repeated at many points in Greece itself, in the Islands, and in Cyprus. The case for it is not susceptible of proof, but some of the evidence reviewed above is open to such an interpretation.</page><page sequence="362">CHAPTER 18 THE BURIAL CUSTOMS W. Cavan AG h A Short History of Tomb Types and Rite SUB-MINOAN AND TRANSITION TO EPG Some 23 tombs have vases which can be dated to this period (2, 16, 18, 24, 25, 26, 40, 45, 48, 56, 98, 112, 121, 160, 186, 200, 201, 202, 207, 208, 222, F/67: 5, F/67: 14), and a further three should belong on the grounds of grave type and burial rite (149, 153, and 282). Most of these tombs cluster at the southern end of the excavation, but 207 is an outlier at this date and 282 may belong to another group. The majority are chamber tombs, evidently concentrated towards the top of the low hill here. Their orientation is generally East-West; whilst it is possible that 112, 16 and 18 might be thought to follow round the slope of the hill, the opposite orientation of the later but adjacent tombs 28 and 82 seems to undermine this view. Although exceptions can be found, orientation of the dromos to the West was preferred in Dark Age Knossos. Details of the chamber tombs' typology will be discussed in the following section. The four shaft-graves, 149, 153, 160 and 282, contained adult inhumations, male where they could be identified. The first three form a close group. The grave pits were cramped: 1.1-1.3 L. X 0.6-0.7 W., but the care with which the shaft and ledges were constructed shows some pains were taken. This grave type was cut to hold inhumations and does not seem to have survived the general adoption of cremation.1467 The third type of sub-Minoan tomb is the pit-cave grave: 186, 200, 201, 202, probably tombs 2, 121 and 208, and perhaps also 98. Tomb 121 lies close to the cluster of shaft-graves, the others form a second group some 25m away. The shafts giving access to these tombs were about the same width as the dromoi to the chamber tombs. Tombs 2 and 121 held inhumations whilst the others contained cremations; the latter have very small chambers, and 200-202 shared the same shaft, a feature probably repeated in tomb 2. Again this type of tomb did not continue into the later period, the latest is probably tomb 208. Both inhumation and cremation are attested at this time: Table 16. Inhumations and cremations in SM contexts. Child Man Woman Adult ? Totals Inhumation 2 4 3 4 5 18 Cremation 123 1 18 Totals 366 5 6 26 1467 59? 79 and 85 are of uncertain type but almost certainly not shaft-graves.</page><page sequence="363">652 w- CAVANAGH These statistics should be treated cautiously because of the incomplete nature of the evidence, but it is reasonable to conclude that inhumation was more common than cremation in the eleventh century, and that both rites were used for both sexes and all age-groups.1468 PROTOGEOMETRIC TO MIDDLE GEOMETRIC The majority of the chamber tombs at the southern end of the excavations had been constructed by LPG, adding eight new tombs to those of SM/EPG: 13, 28, 30, 55, 60, 100, 146 (MG but robbed), 175 and 229. Indeed only the first three of these and 146 have as their earliest pottery vases as late as LPG/PGB. Elsewhere, however, there are tombs brought into use in the ninth century: 1 (MG/LG) (which may not have been a typical chamber tomb), 75 (PGB/EG), 107 (PGB/EG), 129 (EG), 132 (EG/MG), 218 (PGB/EG), 283 (PGB), 292 (PGB), 294 (PGB). The group at the northern end of the excavation shows a slow expansion with two tenth century chamber tombs, 285 and 287, and three probably ninth century, 283, 292 and 294. A new row of tombs is brought into use between the two main clusters also in the ninth century: 75, 107, 129 and 132. There is little evidence that the construction of new chamber tombs continued after the ninth century; those with LG or O pottery as their earliest or with no dating evidence are usually very thoroughly robbed or destroyed: 14, 44, 57, 61, 82, 86, 105, 221, F/67: 9 and 15. It would appear that this trend away from the construction of new tombs had started already in the ninth century. Thus Brock observed that at Fortetsa new tombs were not constructed after the end of the Protogeometric period;1469 note also the 'casual' deposit in a domestic context near the Villa Ariadne;1470 and the pit grave in the Temple Tomb.1471 There are other tombs of this period whose plan is so eroded away that it is impossible to tell much about their original appearance: 80, 103, 104, 106, 134, 147. The earlier example, 80, was almost certainly a standard chamber tomb, but 104/134 and 106 were found close enough to the surface to suggest that they may not have had chambers tunnelled out of the rock, but were simply pits or cuttings into which the cremation urns were placed, again an anticipation of a practice more common later. Inhumation may still just occur in the PG tombs E, J, 28 and perhaps 218 and 2831472 but cremation was the dominant rite from the tenth century onwards. Inhumations of G date are probably infant burials in pithoi: 18.8, 78, in, 280; larnax burials: 31, 85, 113; and perhaps the mud-brick cist grave 182. Child burials in pithoi can be traced back to the Early Dark Age,1473 but are quite widespread later; some of the LG examples, like 78, have valuables in them.1474 LATE GEOMETRIC AND ORIENTALISING It has been suggested that new chamber tombs were not constructed after the ninth century.1475 A possible exception is tomb 19 which shows no evidence of re-use. Yet the 1468 The tholos tomb at Photoula, Praisos, contained a male inhumation and a child cremation, PAE i960, 303. 1469 E p. 4. woBSAtf iq6i 38-41. 1471 KS2 58 no. 323, PM iv 1018. »*72 Cf. also Ayios Ioannis I, II, VI, VII and Vili, BSA 55 (i960) 129-139 and 144; BSA 58 (1963) 34, 38; E 3f.; perhaps also BSA 6 (i8qq-iqoo) 84; BSA *6 (iq6i) 71. i*73 Krya (Siteia) AD 31 (1976) B 381-2; 32 (1977) 336-8; 33 (1978) 390-2.

The tombs whose earliest pottery is LG or O are: 8, 14, 19, 31, 34&gt; 57&gt; 59&gt; 6l&gt; 69&gt; 78&gt; 79&gt; 82, 85, in, 113, 123, 126, 152, i57(?), 159, 163, 168, 182, 221, 247 and F/67: 9. Apart from the robbed chamber tombs (8, 14, 19, 61, 82 perhaps 152 and F/67: 9) these tombs are all curiously ill-defined. Some are niches or side chambers cut into the dromos of a previously existing tomb: 69, 79, i68(?). Others include LM III larnakes evidently exhumed and reinterred in pits: 85 and 113. There are simple pits cut to hold cremation urns: 59, i57(?), 163, 182 and 247, or pithos burials: 78, in. Finally there are tombs so disturbed that it is difficult to say much at all about their form: 34, 57 (these tombs come closest in appearance to true chamber-tombs, but it is not clear that they were properly roofed and distinct from their dromoi; their 'chambers' were cut partly into the dromoi of earlier tombs), 76, 126, 152 and 221. This reads as a sorry catalogue of destroyed and disturbed archaeological contexts, but the conviction remains that the tomb types had changed. Certainly, old chamber tombs continued in use or were re-used, an additional side chamber or niche might be cut from a dromos which already existed. Otherwise cremation urns and pithos burials were placed in amorphous pits, sometimes associated with earlier tombs and sometimes not. The Design, Construction and use of Tombs date of construction and design of the tombs Before pursuing questions of design and construction it is necessary to face the possibility that some of the tombs used during the Dark Age were in fact constructed in the LBA and then re- used. The possibility of re-use has been raised a number of times but this discussion is made mandatory by the suggestion that all Dark Age tombs are of LM construction.1476 If this suggestion prove true then discussion of the architecture, size, positioning and primary use of the tombs becomes largely irrelevant. There are two possible approaches: in the first the architecture of the tombs is compared with that of LBA tombs, and in the second the contents of the tombs are examined for residual LM offerings. The architectural comparison proceeded by means of cluster analysis1477 on the basis of the following characteristics with the statistics for those N Cemetery (=KNC) tombs which are reasonably well preserved: Table 17. Variables used in the analysis of the tombs, and statistics for the N Cemetery tombs (St. D. = Standard deviation). A. Size variables: Variable Abbr. Mean St. D. 1. Area of chamber TAREA 2.33 1.09 2.

Dromos length features in three of the variables. Other possible criteria have been proposed, for example the narrowing of the dromos walls towards the top;1478 this is probably a helpful indicator of LM construction, but unfortunately many tombs are described without record of this feature. In order to give a reasonable range of comparison the 40 tombs of the Knossos cemetery were compared with 52 tombs from elsewhere in the Knossos area: the Fortetsa tombs, Ayios Ioannis Tomb 6,1479 tombs on lower Gypsades1480 and Isopata1481 and a tomb published by Payne,1482 these contained Dark Age pottery but might have been reused. The rest are certain LBA tombs: Mavro Spelio 1, 13, 15, 16, 21, 1483 Isopata tombs 1, 3, and 4, 1484 Hospital Tombs 1, 3, and 5,1485 Sellopoulo Tombs 3 and 4,1486 the Ayios Ioannis 19581487 and Zapher Papoura tombs 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 21, 32, 35, 49, 72, 80, 84, 92-3, 95 and 98-100, and the Milatos Tomb. It is unfortunately the case that the length of the dromos is known for only six of the 19 chamber tombs at Zapher Papoura whose plans are published. For this reason the initial cluster analysis on the 92 Knossos tombs was carried out using only seven variables: TAREA, STW, STL, DRW, STR, SJB and CIN. Trial runs with the data from the Mycenaean mainland tombs showed that the clustering is robust and the reduction from 11 variables to seven tends not to affect the broad groupings, though outliers might move from one cluster to another. Results of the Cluster Analysis Six groups were indicated as representing a reasonable breakdown of the data: 1 17 Tombs: KNC 75, 106, 219, 283, Isopata 3 and 4, Mavro Spelio 1, Hospital Tomb 1, Sellopoulo 3 &amp; 4, Ayios Ioannis 1958, Zafer Papoura 21, 49, 92, 95, 99, 100. 2 3 Tombs: Isopata 1958/3, Zafer Papoura 14, 32. 3 22 Tombs: KNC 82, 207, Fortetsa XI, TFT, Gypsades'58; Mavro Spelio 13, 15, 16, 21, Hospital Tomb 3, Zafer Papoura 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 35, 72, 80, 84, 93, 98 and Milatos Tomb. 4 24 Tombs: KNC F, D, O, 2, 16, 25, 28, 30, 40, 44, 48, 61, 100, 107, 112, 175, 218, 287, 292, Fortetsa IX, II, Ayios Ioannis 6, Gypsades' 75, Payne's tomb. 1478 Coldstream 1963. 1479 Boardman i960; unfortunately the others in the cemetery were too poorly preserved for inclusion. 1480 Gypsades. 1481 Coldstream 1963, cf.

Archaeologically these six clusters make excellent sense. They split into two groups: 1-3 and 4-6. The latter group consists exclusively of tombs with Iron Age pottery with only one exception, Hospital Tomb 5 in cluster 6. The first group included all the tombs of known Bronze Age date bar the one, but a further 10 contained Iron Age pottery. The cluster analysis has offered an unambiguous answer to the controversy, a specific style of tomb construction was employed in the Dark Age and it can be distinguished from the style current in the Bronze Age. The Hospital Tomb 5 is, for some unknown reason, unusual for a Bronze Age Tomb. The clusters cannot, for example, be dismissed as accidental geographical groups, for tombs from different cemeteries are represented in each but the smallest of the clusters. The 18% portion of the tombs containing Iron Age pottery which nevertheless clustered with the Bronze Age tombs might be explained in one of two ways: either they are Bronze Age tombs which were re-used, or they were constructed in the Dark Age but still resemble Bronze Age types in construction. It is proposed to look at these conclusions in turn. The F-ratio statistic (the variance of the particular variable within the cluster, divided by its variance in the whole sample), indicates those variables which draw the members of a cluster especially closely together, the variables most 'typical' of the cases. In TABLE 18 the variables are listed in increasing order of the F-ratio, that is the most distinctive variable first, followed by the second most distinctive and so on. It emerges that the variables of particular importance as far as the three clusters of Bronze Age tombs are concerned are the shape of the stomion, the presence of and size of the jambs to the doorway, the width of the stomion (which however is fairly uniform from cluster to cluster) and the size of the chamber. They can be summarised: Table 18. Main differences in design between Bronze Age and Dark Age chamber tombs at Knossos (St. D.= Standard Deviation).

CAVAN AG H Two variables, the dromos width and the chamber shape variable, were found to have contributed less to the discrimination of the various clusters. As far as the Dark Age tombs are concerned those variables which are especially prominent are the size of the chamber, the absence of jambs (i.e. STW/DRW = i) and the width of the stomion. In other words the chambers of the tombs in the Dark Age clusters are less than half the size even of their smaller Bronze Age counterparts. Could these represent a poorer and a richer class? The finds from the tombs can be brought into the picture, and at the same time Minoan finds from the Dark Age tombs will also be mentioned: Table 19. Dark Age tombs; groups 1 &amp; 3*, and 4-6.

Even tomb 207, which was robbed, still contained a bronze bowl; Fortetsa tomb XI is also rich. The only exception is Fortetsa TFT which is anomalous in shape, and has an extremely asymmetrical stomion which could not be properly conveyed by the sorts of measurement taken, and ought therefore to be disregarded. The appearance of LM finds, on the other hand, cannot be taken to imply the re-use of a tomb; they are by no means restricted to the Bronze Age type of chamber tomb (groups 1-3). 1488 in addition to the above, Minoan relics are also found in tombs of groups 5 &amp; 6: MM pithos in tomb 132, perhaps tomb 55 with a boar's tusk, and the lentoid of serpentine from tomb J. Note also the Minoan seal in 129 and the LM II oval-mouthed jar in G. Secondly there is evidence for the re-use of Minoan larnakes outside of chamber tombs: KNC tombs 85, 103 and 113. Moreover other Minoan larnakes occur in tombs Q,, whose concentration of 1488 Platon recognised Minoan antiques in the Dark Age tholoi at Adhromyloi, PAE 1954, 366.</page><page sequence="368">THE BURIAL CUSTOMS 657 Minoan finds make it a strong candidate for re-use,1489 31, 98, 107, 134, 292 and 294. Some of these contexts indicate that the larnakes were removed from another tomb. Of the remainder 292 is the best candidate as a re-used Minoan tomb, but the cluster analysis is against this. The presence of a larnax does not seem to be decisive. In brief therefore we would argue that the evidence for the re-use of Minoan tombs in this cemetery is not convincing; those tombs which are similar to Minoan tombs in design are in fact the richest of the Dark Age tombs and for that reason unlikely to be re-used. Geographically they are associated in clusters with tombs of Dark Age construction, and in spite of the relatively dense concentration of LM tombs to the north of Knossos none is found in connection with the tombs studied here. POSITION WITHIN THE CEMETERY The choice of cemetery can in theory have been dictated by continuity of use from the Minoan period, or rather the continued consecration of Minoan Cemeteries, by practical considerations such as the suitability of the land for tomb construction, by convenience because Minoan tombs were available, and by proximity to the village, or location on land holdings.1490 The widely scattered distribution of the Knossian Dark Age cemeteries cannot be wholly explained by the first three factors; there is an element of selection and evidently conscious grouping of the tombs. The clusters of chamber tombs are arrayed in rows of four to six tombs; sometimes satellite tombs seem to be added outside the main alignments, sometimes other SM types precede the chamber tombs, and sometimes there are isolated tombs. In particular in the southern part of the KMF excavations the pattern breaks down into a more chaotic agglomeration, though a basic row of chamber tombs can perhaps be discovered in 106, 40, 112 and 16. Most chamber tombs in each cluster come into use over a short span of time: I. i65 40, io6, 112 (SM, the re-used 106 is later, PGB-EG?) II. 24, 25, 30, 45, 56 (SM-EPG) III. 44, 48, 60, 61 (SM/EPG and robbed) IV 100, 146, 175, 207, 229 (EPG, MG?, EPG, SM/EPG, EPG) V 75, 107, 129, 132 (EG, PGB, EG, EG) VI. 283, 285, 286, 287, 292, 294, 306 (PGB, EPG, EG, (M)LPG, PGB, PGB, PGB), VII. TEKE G, H J, K, L, N (LPG, PGB, EPG, EPG, EPG, PGB- perhaps two groups?), VIII. (another if less coherent cluster) 219, 14, 13, 19 &amp; 55 (EPG, LG/EO, PGB/EG, LG, EPG). The tombs in each group are largely in contemporary use; the first two groups (T. 106 apart) over a short period, the others, so far as can be told, over generations. Only in the case of 285 and 286 can a case be made for successive use (v. tomb description). CONSTRUCTION AND CAPACITY Although in their essential design the Dark Age chamber tombs follow the Bronze Age tradition, the cluster analysis has shown that the tombs differ in detail from their precursors. 1489 Tomb Qwas not included in the statistical analysis as its plan is incomplete. 1490 Cf.

The dromos is on average no smaller than that of the less grand LM chamber tombs. On the other hand less care is expended in carving the entrance, which has narrow jambs, if any at all, and tends to be much shorter. The chamber is on average half the size of the Bronze Age chambers; perhaps in part because of the change of rite, as cremations can be packed into a smaller space; nevertheless this diminution in size is found quite generally in Dark Age tombs, and the earliest KNC chamber tombs were cut in the first place for inhumations. Dromos The dromos is not simply a means of access to the tomb; for this the pit of the pit-cave type would have served. Yet although the pit-cave seems more common in the SM period the fashion did not prevail. The chamber-tomb with a regular dromos was preferred. It would seem, nevertheless, that the dromos was not left open for long, for there are no reports of a primary silt or humus level on the floor;1491 evidently the dromos was filled immediately after the first burial and thereafter only the innermost portion of the dromos fill would usually be removed.1492 The form of the dromos is decided by the angle of the slope into which it is cut, the depth of the chamber, and the desired length. The majority of the tombs at Knossos had sloping dromoi (the main exceptions being: H, 8, 285, 292 and 294 whose dromoi, as far as preserved, sloped very gently). In scattered examples the device of a steep step or steps at the very beginning of the dromos (19, 40, 132, 287) or of steps along its course (F, O, 25, 80, 106, 125, 175) served to shorten its length. Stomion The cluster analysis has indicated that after the overall size of the chamber it is the form and shape of the stomion which most clearly distinguishes the Dark Age tombs from their Bronze Age predecessors. They tend to be shorter and more carelessly rendered. Perhaps the more effectively to mark the entrance, therefore, a step was made down into the chamber (J, L, M, N, 48, 120, 121, 186, 218, 285, 294, F67/9),1493 sometimes a steeper drop (55, 146, 286, 287) or even a threshold (D, F, G, H, Q,, 13, 106, 129, 219, 229). Only exceptionally is there no step in the stomion (132, 207, 283). Niches Niches are found in the dromoi of tombs H, O, Q,, 13, 14, 24, 28, 55, 60, 61, 75, 82, 107, 132, 175, 218, 283, 287, 292 and 294. In their Bronze Age predecessors dromos niches tend to hold subsidiary burials, not infrequently those of children, but this seems not to hold for the Dark Age tombs. In some cases they contain urns as late if not later than those in the main chamber, which was presumably full: 294, 292, 13. Less well attested are niches to hold vases cleared out of the chamber, in a major reorganisation: O and possibly 28 and 75. There is a remainder where the burials in niches are no earlier or later than those in the chamber, but do not seem to be the result of clearance: Q,, 55?, 60(138), 107, 175, 283, 287. 1491 The silt in the dromos of Tomb O belongs to the period when the tomb was robbed. 1492 F. p. 4. 1493 Also found at Mastamba, Lembessi PAE 1970, 272.</page><page sequence="370">THE BURIAL CUSTOMS 659 THE USE OF THE TOMBS The long history of multiple burial, later re-use and the general vicissitudes of time conspire to limit this section of the discussion. Of the 120 contexts some 51 must be omitted either because they were so completely destroyed as to rule out any conclusion, or because they are irrelevant, viz. the pyres 176 and 310 and the various single graves. The remainder, even where seriously disturbed, contain sufficient sherds to permit a realistic estimate of their periods and duration of use. It is assumed that where a gap can be perceived in the pottery sequence, this is due to temporary abandonment and later re-use of the tomb. Let us assume that each of the following periods represents a span of 50 years: SM, EPG, MPG, LPG, PGB + EG, MG, LG, EO + MO, LO. Table 20. Duration over which tombs were used. Years 0-50 50-100 100-150 150-200 200-250 250-300 300-350 350-400 Total Primary 29 8 16 4 7 1 2 2 69 Re-use 3630 10 o o 13 Total 32 14 19 4 8 1 2 2 82 Granted the loose foundations of these statistics, it is still clear that over half the collective burial places were used for no more than three or four generations, and perhaps only 15% or so continued in use by the same group for more than 200 years, say eight generations. The tombs may have lasted so little for accidental reasons such as dilapidation of the structure, but two arguments point to another conclusion. In the first place the geographical clusters distinguished above consist of tombs in coeval use, not consecutive as one might expect had they replaced one another. Secondly in the later periods the chamber seems to have been little more than a focus for burials which could be laid in open trenches, the dromos or a side niche. The length of time the tombs last seems rather to reflect the duration of the social group which had access to the sepulchre. Numbers of Burials Given the fragmentary nature of the evidence, disturbances caused by the repeated use of the tombs, destruction, robbing and dilapidation, it is very difficult to produce reliable statistics. As described elsewhere 363 separate deposits of cremated remains were recorded from the cemetery, but only a maximum of 80 were found in urns; the others were scattered deposits, some, no doubt, the result of vicissitudes. Thus a somewhat more reliable guide to numbers might be the cremation urns for they often survive, even if in a fragmentary state. The uncertainties here arise from questions of usage. There seems little doubt that most pithoi served as ossuaries, though it is worth recording that polychrome pithoi tend to go in pairs1494 and a coarse pithos is recorded from Tomb 222 which appears to have contained no cremations. Nevertheless the 422 pithoi recorded seem a reasonable minimum number for the burials.1495 Higher estimates depend on further assumptions. It would appear that vases other than pithoi were sometimes used as urns, but so rarely as not seriously to affect the statistics: 1494 Moignard, p. 426; note a similar observation of Payne regarding the pithoi 15 and 16 BSA 29 (1927-28) 228, and his comment that Orientalising pithoi may have been placed as offerings op. cit. 229. 1495 Hutchinson likewise relied on the number of pithoi to compute the cremations at Khaniale Teke BSA 49 (1953) 222. All the pithoi at Ay. Paraskies contained ashes: Platon AE !945-47&gt; 75-</page><page sequence="371">66o W. CAVAN AG H Table 21. Vases other than pithoi containing ashes. Tomb Vase Type 107.59 Pyxis 285.60 Krater 285.79 Cauldron 287.15 Cauldron Some tombs, moreover, hold insufficient pithoi to account for the burials suggested by the chronological range of the grave offerings: D, J, 25, 45, 56, 60, 98. In most of these cases the insufficiency can be made up by counting kraters and/or amphorae as urns as well. In the early phase these outnumber pithoi, but their popularity went into decline and in the LPG period it is overtaken by the pithos (ILL. 9). It is possible that this decline reflects a change of use and that in the later periods the amphora was only rarely used as an urn.1496 In tombs 18 and 24 amphorae are associated with inhumations, as offerings, and in tomb 75 the MG neck- handled amphora was associated with the cremation in 75.38; also the amphorae 40.11 &amp; 16 are stated not to have contained cremations. The graph shows a plot of the pithoi and the total of pithoi, amphorae and kraters over time. Urns other than these are so unusual that they do not seriously affect the figures. It is clear that some SM cremations were not placed in urns (Tombs 200 and 201); it is assumed here however that later scattered collections of ashes are not deliberate deposits but the result of disturbance. If in fact unurned deposition was the practice later on, the figures presented here should be revised upwards. On the assumptions that the tombs are reasonably well preserved and that all cremations were inurned, the top line on the graph will set a ceiling of 671 for the number buried in the tombs and the lower line is close to a minimum estimate (422); the truth probably lies somewhere between. All these assumptions are weak, but not unreasonable. For this reason relative fluctuations will be discussed first, and absolute figures second. On almost any count the number of burials reaches a very marked peak in the Geometric period. Thus the N Cemetery at Knossos provides another example of the phenomenon identified by Snodgrass in Attica and the Argolid of the same period: a surge in the number of those buried.1497 No doubt here too it is a result of an increase in population.1498 III. 9 suggests, on the face of it that the peak is reached in the eighth century. In ILL. 10, however, the numbers of urns for each period is divided by the estimated duration of that period, to give crude figures for the number of cremations per year. Here it is seen that the steep increase occurs distinctly earlier than has been found elsewhere, namely in the ninth century. Two further observations temper, though they do not dispose of, the interpretation in terms of population increase. First of all at Knossos, as in Athens, there is a decline as we move into the seventh century. The second is best illustrated by another graph (ILL. 11): here the total number of pithoi and amphorae per period is divided by the number of tombs from which 1496 Indeed it is difficult to find a certain case at Knossos of the amphora as an urn: Hood and Boardman suggest that the EG amphora 3 from F. Tomb A was probably an urn together with 1 and 3, BSA 56 (1961) 70; and amphorae are also regarded as urns in the Ayios Ioannis publication BSA 55 (i960) 133; pithoi were conspicuously rare from Ayios Ioannis op. cit. 142. Bell-kraters were used as urns at Fortetsa, F. VI.45 and XL 159 as well as the bronze cauldron XL 190, and at Ayios Ioannis III.i, BSA 55 (i960) 132; kraters and amphorae are sometimes expressly stated not to have contained ashes: F.

The low average in the SM period is probably a reflection of the difference of rite, and strictly inhumations should be counted too. These two observations give credence to the view argued by Morris1500 for Attica, namely that there was a change of custom, with access to the cemetery opened in the eighth century. This leads us to the questions of the absolute number of burials in the tombs and of access. If very crudely each period is considered to last about one generation (SM, EPG, MPG, LPG, PGB, EG, MG, LG, EO, MO, LO = 11 periods over c. 350 years), the above figures suggest that just over two people would be buried in the tombs in each generation; which in turn suggests that access to the tomb was limited to the narrowest of kin groups. This is further borne out by the histogram of amphorae and pithoi per tomb (ILL. 12), where it is shown that the majority of tombs have 10 or fewer urns over their total duration. In only seven cases out of the 75 tombs here considered are more than five urns found to belong to any given period: Table 22. Tombs in which more than 5 urns are found in any one period. Tomb Period Pithoi Amphorae Total G EG 7 5 12 G MG 3 4 7 O LG/LGEO 7 7 Q, LG/LGEO 7 10 75 MG/MGLG 10 10 75 EO 7 107 LG/LGEO 6 1 7 107 EO 11 2 13 218 MG 7 7 218 LG 9 1 10 292 MG 5 38 292 LG 16 2 18 292 EO 6 3 9 It is noteworthy these belong to the eighth century, already distinguished as an exceptional period.1501 In summary therefore it appears that access to each tomb was limited to very few individuals. Skeletal analysis has shown above that both males and females, and some children were buried in the tombs, and this is also indicated by the grave offerings. The most natural interpretation is that the tombs were family tombs and served a very narrow kin group. 1499 The error-bars on the plot were calculated on the basis of the firmest associations attested v. TABLE 9 below. In order to calculate the error-bars the date of each urn (say LG) was assigned a value of o and any associated pot scored 1 for each period later and -1 for each period earlier than the period of the urn. Thus an associated pot dated LGEO would score 0.5, one dated MGLG -0.5 and one dated LG o and so forth. The mean and standard deviation was then calculated for all associated vases: 0.4 ± 0.8 X 40 years (on average) per period = 16 ± 32 years. This is a crude measure but as good as the disturbed contexts will allow. 1500 Morris 1987 esp. chapters 4-8. 1501 jn p the closed PG tombs contained one to three burials; Payne BSA 33 (1931-32) 217, E 11.</page><page sequence="376">THE BURIAL CUSTOMS 665 Histogram of Amphorae &amp; Pithoi/tomb 20 1 &lt;/&gt; C Urn 10- 1 1 11 I In Hh n m w 1 i i i » i i i i i i 0 10 20 30 40 50 Tombs III. 12. Histogram of urns (amphorae and pithoi) per tomb.</page><page sequence="377">666 w- CAVAN AG H First use and re-use To conclude this section on the use of the tombs it remains to discuss their initial use, the occasion of their construction and their demise, hiatus in use and re-use. It is almost impossible, given the confusion of their contents, to isolate the first burial in any tomb. As a working hypothesis it can be assumed that the occasion for the construction of a tomb is to be equated with the establishment of a given 'family5 in the locality. The arguments adduced above indicate that dilapidation was not a reason for abandoning a tomb and establishing a new one. If anything the practice of re-use indicates a desire to establish a link with earlier burials, whilst as time went on monumentality in tomb construction was eschewed. How then to explain the relatively short life of the tombs (v. TABLE 20 supra)? The answer I believe lies in the narrow family group indicated for those who used the tomb. On a crude interpretation, at least, the tomb in Dark Age Knossos was passed from father to a single heir; the tomb was not normally shared equally by an ever expanding lineage.1502 With such frequent fission, and fission at so low a level it is not surprising that lines should come to an end so soon, after a few generations. The evidence for the re-use of earlier tombs, a practice which can be traced at least as early as the twelfth century,1503 consists of a gap in the chronology of the pottery so wide that an interruption of use seems the only realistic explanation: Table 23. Tombs with an hiatus indicating re-use. Tomb ist Use 2nd Use Tomb ist Use 2nd Use 13 LPG EO-LO 18 SM PGB/EG 24 SM/EPG MG 25 SM/EPG LO 26 SM LG 28 LPG EO 40 SM LG 45 SM/EPG? MG/LG 48 SM/EPG O 56 SM/EPG EO 60 EPG MG/LG 98 SM/EPG MG/LG 229 EPG PGB/EG Unfortunately most of these tombs were disturbed and their contents mixed: 13, 24, 25 (the later vases might derive from tomb 34), 45, 48, 56, 60, 98, 229. In tombs 26 and 40 the earliest burials had been covered by a layer of kouskouras fallen from the roof before the later burials were inserted. In the case of 18 the burials of the first period were effectively sealed inside the chamber by the EG pithos burial 18.8, which may have been thus placed unconsciously. The orientalising burial of 28 was placed in the dromos with some reference to the earlier ones. The Funeral Ritual mourning In this section an attempt will be made to follow through the main stages of the funeral, though the phases before arrival at the cemetery are clearly not easily recoverable. In Crete we cannot turn to the series of Prothesis and Ekphora scenes which grace Attic LG vases. The 1502 xhe grouping of the tombs, on the other hand, might reflect some larger kinship; exceptions can be found such as those listed above and the somewhat similar tomb on the Gypsades Hill, BSA 76 (1981) 143. 1503 Mee &amp; Cavanagh 1978.</page><page sequence="378">THE BURIAL CUSTOMS 667 mourners (and corpse?) painted on Fortetsa no.339 are the best hint, itself not unambiguous, of mourning ritual. Evidently the dead would be laid out with the appanage appropriate to their state. This at least seems to follow from the dress ornaments and grave goods burnt with the body and included in the urn.1504 Iron fragments from tomb 219 have been attributed to an iron and wooden bier, though one different in design from the catafalques illustrated on the Athenian vases. Otherwise the preparation of the body, the winding cloth, the wake and the journey to the grave are irretrievable through archaeology. PYRES 176 and 310 were distinguished as pyres. Both lie within the cemetery area and 310 is immediately adjacent to the dromos of 219 which it served. It is possible that others were not found because of erosion. In both cases an ash pit was dug to a depth of at least 20 cm; the pyre would have been built up above this; though no post-holes are reported the temperatures inferred, c. 900o C, would require a strong artificial draught. In 310 were stratified the remains of two or three pyres. The few small finds and pot-sherds confirm that grave-goods were burnt with the dead, and perhaps that some care was taken to recover them afterwards.1505 Sherds of the two kraters 219.71 (LG) and 219.80 (LPG) again might indicate the immolation of grave offerings, given that most of the fragments were found in the tomb.1506 On the other hand the Tire baskets' from 219 and 285 point to an elaborate ritual at the pyre; presumably they were made specifically for the purpose. The find of grain in 310 is unique, and speculation about its symbolic significance is best avoided.1507 URNS Although some offerings were burnt with the body,1508 the majority of vases, and indeed other offerings, do not show traces of burning. Cremation would have taken many hours and its thoroughness has been commented on below.1509 The bones were then collected with great care and assiduity, once the pyre had been doused. Observation has confirmed that the bones were wrapped in a cloth.1510 The varieties of urn reflect fashion; at least there is no evidence that different types were used for the two sexes in the manner of neck-handled and belly- handled amphorae at Athens.1511 Undoubtedly polychrome pithoi were made for funerary use,1512 perhaps to order. The custom must go back earlier, but it is impossible to say by how much. Coarse pithoi are found in domestic deposits1513 and would certainly not have been special commissions. But decorated pithoi are also reported from these contexts, and their iconography cannot be shown to be funerary. It has been remarked that some of the urns appear 'earlier' than the vases which accompany them. Indeed analysis on the basis of the firm associations confirms this suggestion.1514 It does not, however, follow that the urns were old at the time of burial; the facts might equally well be explained if, for example, a more conservative style of decoration was preferred for urns. 1504 See TABLE 24 pp 668-70. 1505 Tne similar clean state of the pyres at Mastabas led to the suggestion that they were fires for the immolation of sacrifices rather than true pyres: Lembessi PAE 1970, 296-7. 1506 The suggestion that oinochoai were used to douse the flames of the pyre, e.g. Platon AE 1945-47, is based on Homeric parallels. 1507 Pyres were also located between the tombs at Khaniale Teke BSA 49 (1954) 219. 1508 Note, for example, the traces of burning on the metal stand and gold-leaf in tombs 200/201; cf. the Gortyn tholos tomb PAE 1966, 190. 1509 Muserrave, eh. io, pp. 686-q. 1510 Musgrave, ch. 19, p. 690; cf.

CAVANAGH FUNERARY MEAL Quite apart from skeletons of whole animals accompanying the dead there are examples of animal bones from various contexts.1515 These bones can be divided in two categories: teeth which might have been used as amulets: N, O, 14, 30, 46, 75, 98, 107, 175, 285 and 292, these include cattle, dog, sheep/goat and pig teeth. Secondly there are bones from joints of meat: 0,5 34? 75? J47 and 283; these are all fragments of sheep/goat except for the pig tibia from tomb Q. Some were included with the cremated bones, and a sheep/goat metacarpal was found in the urn 75.74. Perhaps in these cases the meat was burnt on the pyre, in a funerary meal in which the dead were thought to have a share.1516 The fenugreek seeds in T. 229 would have been an offering, not the remains of a meal (p. 636 above). VASE OFFERINGS A number of interpretations can be placed on the grave goods found in the tomb: (i) The personal effects of the deceased, or possessions reflecting their standing. (ii) Provisions to equip the dead for the next world, or the journey to the next world. (iii) Offerings brought by mourners as gifts for the dead. (iv) Paraphernalia required for the ritual. Initially vase offerings will be considered. Over and above the urns and their lids, which clearly belong to category (iv), there can be distinguished: perfume flasks, drinking vessels (jugs, kraters and dinoi), pyxides and various miscellaneous types: kernoi, askoi, models, stands, plates, trays, lekanides and basins. These categories should be regarded with some caution. Thus is it possible that types of perfume flask were differentiated according to sex, or use, for the palaestra, for example? Within the drinking vessels should we distinguish hydriai and perhaps jugs, which might be thought to lie within the realm of women, from oinochoai, perhaps distinctive of men, if not suggestive of the symposium?1517 Do the different types of drinking vessel reflect different activities, say skyphoi for wine and cups for water? Because the tombs are collective and the contexts disturbed, it is very difficult to come to firm conclusions, but it should, perhaps, be made clear that these questions have been addressed. In these collective tombs it is almost impossible to isolate specific grave groups; the more reliable of the associations are: TABLE 24. Relatively secure associations with urn burials.

Initially two classes of vessel were investigated: (a) Perfumed oil flasks: stirrup jars, lekythoi, aryballoi and lentoid flasks; (b) Drinking vessels: skyphoi, kotylai and cups. Their totals for each period were divided by the number of cremation urns, as defined above. The graph illustrates that on average one of each type was found per urn (ILL. 13). Of course such an average might hide significant divergences; a table derived from the above securer associations indicates that oil flasks are indeed fairly widely distributed but not cups (including skyphoi and kotylai): Oil flasks, no cups Cups, no oil flasks Cups &amp; oil flasks. 35 4 6 It should, however, be noted that oil flasks are easier to put inside urns than drinking vessels, especially from LG onwards when the urn mouths tend to get narrower.

At this time whole services of vessels seem to have accompanied certain burials e.g. with 285.82 13 MPG small bell skyphoi, or in tomb J eleven Attic LPG cups. Similar if smaller sets are found in tombs E, G, Q, 100, 175, 207, 219, 283, 285 and 287. It is noteworthy that kraters are also considerably more common in LPG and PGB than at other periods. This fashion for drinking sets is discernable if less marked in the following period e.g. 104.61, 96, 101, 113; 106. 1, 10, 11, 27; 134-2, 95 17» 20, 63, 66; 40. 38, 39, 41, 44; 34.6, 7, 11, 19, 31. Do the jugs throw any light on the distribution of drinking vessels? Although in a crude statistical sense there is a high correlation (0.85) between the occurrence of jugs (hydriai, oinochoai, jugs and olpai) and the occurrence of drinking vessels (skyphoi, kotylai and cups), when these are plotted on a graph the points are somewhat scattered (ILL. 14). The straight line on the graph represents a one-to-one correspondence, and the outliers some distance above the line include those with sets of cups or skyphoi (most markedly J, 207, 219). More normally however, it appears that just one or two cups accompanied each jug.1518 no pyxides have been found, that is to say considerably fewer than the 679 cups and 469 jugs or 481 unguent vessels. Assuming about 500 burials and that pyxides are no more or less likely to survive than the urns, at most between 20 and 25% of burials had them. There is good reason to suppose that in contemporary Attic graves pyxides appear most frequently in female graves.1519 This is impossible to prove of the Knossos tombs. Vase offerings other than these major types are varied and relatively rare: kernoi, askoi and animal vases, models, stands, plates and trays, lekanides and basins. Because each of these types is relatively rare and clear associations cannot be established, it is difficult to generalise about their significance in the funerary ceremony. OFFERINGS OTHER THAN VASES There is a great variety of offerings in addition to the vases. It is possible to distinguish, more or less in order of frequency: jewellery, weapons, 'domestic' equipment including knives, obeloi, tripods and firedogs, copper, faience and stone vessels, tools and miscellaneous types such as cosmetic items, horse-bits, figurines and a gaming piece (Tomb 294). It is difficult to say which, if any, of the offerings were burnt on the pyre together with the deceased and which were placed directly in the tomb. The amber (18, 78, 82, 104, 218 and 229) would certainly have melted at temperatures over 400o C; indeed traces of burning are not reported on any of the finds. About 190 weapons were found in 32 tombs; most commonly these are spears and javelins, then in about equal numbers swords (24) and dirks/daggers (28). Archery equipment and armour are less common. The tools include axes and double axes as well as more specialist tools such as chisels, an axe-adze, a graver and a rasp (75, 86, 218, 292). Obsidian flakes and blades occur in six contexts and need not be strays. Stone and clay 'whorls' are found and two loom-weights are reported from tomb G. Ornaments are reported from 55 tombs, most frequently pins and fibulae, which may have held up the doric peplos; beads are also quite common, among them the clay beads which are like those from Attic female and child graves, and are also known from Lefkandi. The scarabs (48, 78, 107, 229) and faience figurines of Ptah and Nefertum (78) are presumably amulets, perhaps the antique gems are too (J, 2?, 18, 129). 1518 For a similar observation see Platon, AE 1945-47, 75. 1519 Cavanagh 1977, 308.</page><page sequence="384">THE BURIAL CUSTOMS 67c Oil flasks and Drinking vessels per urn 3.5-.

The number of drinking vessels per tomb plotted against the number of jugs.</page><page sequence="385">674 w- CAVANAGH In summary therefore and very broadly two possible generalities suggest themselves. In the first place there are offerings which are so common as to imply that they were either a necessary part of the funeral or were considered essential for the future life: oil flasks, drinking vessels or drinking sets, and perhaps jewellery and trinkets, though the last is a rather wide category. Unguents might have served to anoint the body before cremation. It has been suggested, furthermore, that the cups were for a final 'toast5 to the deceased.1520 In neither case does the theory entirely explain why the empty vessels had to accompany the body to the tomb. In the second place some tombs, and probably certain burials within those tombs, were marked by a lavish display and reduplication of offerings (75, 219, 283, 285). In these cases there is no clear rule as to the type of offering, nothing, for example, to be compared with the Egyptian obsessive provision for every need. The offerings seem to express a respect for the good things of life, banqueting and conviviality, plate and prized possessions. Otherwise there seem to be placed with the dead their more intimate goods: the warrior's weapons, the woman's spindle, and the child's toy. ANIMAL SACRIFICE In addition to those traces of animal bones which seem to have served as food offerings there are two major deposits which represent a different custom. Tomb 79 contained the skeletons of two horses and the remains of two dogs. As far as can be judged from the very disturbed circumstances, the horse burials of tombs 152 (again a pair) and 1631521 belong to the same phase. Their date, however, is uncertain; it would seem natural to associate them with the LG-EO urns placed over them, but the very close parallels at Prinias raise the possibility that the horse burials belong to an earlier stage: those at Prinias appear to date to the tenth or ninth centuries BC. Some were found in the dromoi of tombs of the second phase there, others, like ours, in separate pits.1522 The animals were evidently sacrificed at the tomb and not at the pyre.1523 Indeed the parallels at Prinias, again with pairs of horses and probably dogs, raise the possibility that these are more general sacrifices, not associated with a particular burial.1524 The presence of dogs hints at hunting and, in an Iron Age context, therefore, not chariotry, but certainty is impossible. Discussion It remains to place these findings in a broader context. A major change in burial customs is one of the most marked innovations at the end of LM/LH III C and the sub- Minoan/Mycenaean period throughout Greece.1525 In Crete this realignment can be recognised by the establishment of new cemeteries,1526 by changes in the design of tombs and 1520 Boardman, BSA ^ (iq6o) 144. 1521 The horse bones from Ts. 152 and 163 are probably associated 1522 Rizza 1978 esp. 122 ff. 1523 This can be paralleled tor example at Lelkandi, Popham et al. 1982, and the fact that the animals were not cremated is no argument in favour of a sub-Minoan date. 1524 Rizza 1978 122-6, 1979; even the possibility of sacrifice to the gods is raised. To the Bronze Age parallels cited we can now add Protonotariou-Deilaki 1990, and Popham et al. 1982. 1525 Desborough 1964 32-40, 1972 266-77, Snodgrass 1971 esp. 177-97- 1526 Dreros, van Effenterre 1947, 17; Karphi, BSA 38 (1938-39) 100 if.; Kavousi, AJA 5 (1901) 125 ff.; Krya, AD 31 (1976) B 381-2; 33 (I977) 39°~92; Mouliana, AE 1904, 21 ff.; Panayia, AJA 5 (1901) 283 ff., Am. 10-12 (1927-28) 389-400; Phaistos (Hill), Boll. d'Arte 1955 159; Phaistos, Liliana, MA 14, 627 ff.; Piati, BSA 20 (1913-14) 14; Prinias, Rizza 1978; Sykia (Adhromyloi), PAE 1954, 365-67; Vrokastro, Hall 1914, 123-53.

The first of these raises issues of the settlement of populations which lie outside the scope of this chapter. In tomb types a less radical change is observed in most parts of Crete than in those other parts of Greece where single burial displaces collective tombs. The adaptation at Knossos whereby chamber tombs follow a smaller design can be paralleled elsewhere in Crete by the adoption of small corbelled tombs, usually rectangular in plan.1527 Chamber tombs are less common.1528 It is tempting to link the reduction in size of the tomb chambers to the change in rite (to cremation). Thus at Prinias the SM/EPG cremations were laid in bottle-shaped pits, and the inhumations in built tombs of an increasingly debased form.1529 However at Knossos the facts do not seem to support this reasoning as inhumation is, at first, still practised.1530 A more radical explanation is needed in terms of the conditions of life during the Dark Age. Cremation had subsisted as a minority rite during the Late Bronze Age.1531 The move towards an increasing use of cremation is fairly widespread in Crete, witnessed, for example, at Krya (Siteia),1532 at Vrokastro (Mirabello),1533 Phaistos (Mesara)1534 and, eventually at least, in the far west of Crete as at Gavalomouri.1535 In spite of the many other signs of cultural isolation in the late eleventh and early tenth centuries BC, it is difficult not to see the widespread adoption of cremation, as a sign of some community of custom and belief, linking Crete and Knossos with much of central Greece. The ultimate abandonment, in the N Cemetery, of chamber tomb construction in favour of large collective pits, can also be paralleled, if in a somewhat more formal manner, by the 'bone enclosures' at Vrokastro1536 and Prinias.1537 Attention has already been drawn to the similarity between the horse burials at Prinias and those at Knossos. The child pithos burials of eighth century date also serve to underline the links in practice between the different regions of Crete. The burial customs of Knossos, whilst distinguishable from those of eastern and western Crete, were in important ways influenced by general trends: in the rite of cremation, in the design of the tomb types; in the choice of grave offerings there is a broad community with the rest of the island, and, to a lesser degree, with the rest of Greece. This can, in part, be traced to a common Bronze Age ancestry. Nevertheless, whilst the practices in the earliest period of use at the N Cemetery were closely allied to those of the Late Bronze Age, there was a constant impetus to change. Chamber tomb construction may eventually have been abandoned as unnecessary, for the chamber tomb has been judged an unsuitable repository for urns;1538 all the same the desire to retain a locus for collective burial persisted. The links thereby symbolised in death must have been important in life. In ways like this the traditions of the past were transformed by fashion and influences from abroad, and by the very structures of a society formed under the stresses of the Dark Age. 1527 At Erganos such small tholos tombs are found dating to LM III B, AJA 5 (1901) 262 fif. 1528 Mastamba, AD 31 (1976) B 351. Compare also the burial caves of Eastern Crete: Ay. Spiridon, AR 32 (1986), 94; Berati and Langoupha, PAE 1953, 292, 294; Zou, PAE 1954, 363.

MUSGRAVE1539 SECTION 1: THE CREMATIONS Introduction1540 I studied the N cemetery burials in the summers of 1979 to 1982. A catalogue of the cremations was completed in June 1983. A separate typescript MS on the SM burials was submitted to HWC the previous autumn.1541 Drafts of this report were submitted in April 1985 and May 1987. The last was revised in the spring of 1995. In the intervening years I have gained more experience from studying other collections of cremations.1542 It seemed sensible therefore to incorporate some recent findings into this final report without completely re-writing it. I have also unashamedly raided my recent reports to spare the reader the need to spend time chasing references cited elsewhere in publications not necessarily to hand. THE STUDY OF CREMATIONS The study of ancient cremated remains can yield information that is useful to both archaeologists and anthropologists.1543 This is largely due to the examination and reporting techniques devised by many authors.1544 These early pioneers concentrated mainly on 1539 Acknowledgements: I should like to thank Professor Nicolas Coldstream and Dr. Hector Catling for inviting me to examine and report on this interesting and important collection; Mrs S. Wall-Crowther, Dr. Jo Price and Dr. Colin Gilbert for loyal help in the field; Dr. Jill Carington-Smith, the late Dr. T. E. Thompson, Mrs S. Wall-Crowther and Ms Chrissie de la Mahotière for professional assistance; and Mrs Joyce Bishop and Mrs RoseMary Musgrave for secretarial assistance. I am especially grateful to the British Academy, the British School at Athens, the Leverhulme Trust Fund and the University of Bristol for grants towards the cost of long visits to Crete in the summers of 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982. 1540 xhe writer of a bone report in a predominantly archaeological volume faces the problem of where references to scientific papers should be cited. Strings of parentheses in the text can make it appear ugly and irritate the reader. Citing them in footnotes can be equally annoying: 'I see no reason why I should look to the bottom of a page to find a confusing mass of more than 30 references.' Walz (1994). I have tried to steer a middle course, consigning multiple citations to footnotes, but retaining a few single references in parentheses in the text. 1541 See Catling (1995). It gave me great happiness to discover that some of the first KNC bones I examined - alone, imprisoned in the Fortetsa Apotheke and without a clue as to their significance - contributed to such an exciting story. 1542 Lower Gypsades Hill (Musgrave 1981), Torone (Musgrave: final report awaiting publication), Vergina (Musgrave 1984, 1985, 1990a, 1991) Nea Mihaniona (Musgrave 1990b), Derveni Beta (Musgrave 1990b), Phoinikas (Musgrave: report in preparation), Lefkandi Toumba Ts. 50, 55 and ^8 (Musgrave: report in preparation). 1543 See Brothwell (10.81Ì. 1544 Among them Gejvall (1947, 1951, 1969), Gejvall and Sahlström (1948), Lisowski (1956a, 1956b, 1968), Weiner (1951), Wells (i960), Merbs (1967), Spence (1967a) and Van Vark (1974, 1975).</page><page sequence="388">678 J- H. MUSGRAVE metrical and macroscopic methods of investigation. More recently the study of cremations has become increasingly experimental and laboratory-based.1545 The aims of these pioneers and their followers has been to convince archaeologists that cremated remains should not be ignored simply because, to the untutored eye, they resemble nothing more exciting than a bag of apparently uninformative misshapen fragments. In fact, as most regions of the skeleton can often be identified, it is possible to coax this seemingly intractable material into telling us quite a lot about the sex, age, and pathology of each subject; and, indirectly, cast some light on funerary practices and burial customs. Before assessing the value to science of the Knossos cremations it might be helpful to place them in context. This can be done by drawing attention to a selection of reports on some cremations - ancient and modern - from Europe, America and Australia.1546 This list obviously contains only a very small number indeed of the archaeological cremation reports published during the past few years. It is hoped therefore that its incompleteness may encourage any interested readers to send me details of the many more that have been omitted. AIM The aim of a student of cremations is exactly the same as that of the student of a complete inhumed skeleton. He or she wishes to discover the sex and age of each subject; the condition of the dentition; whether any pathological changes had taken place; how many individuals may be represented in any given collection; whether animal bones had also been buried with them; and whether the total assemblage can yield any information about burial customs. MATERIAL The cremated human remains from the Geometric tombs in the Knossos N Cemetery are contained in 363 separate bags and weigh 84968 g (84.968 kg; 187.32 lb; 13.38 stones; just over half a pound of burnt bone fragments per bag). Of these 363 separate collections 74 definitely came from numbered urns and a further seven may have (see the Appendix at the end of this chapter). A complete cremation is illustrated in PLATE 313a. The smallest urn burial weighed 1 g; the largest 2324 g (285.39) The SM cremations were too few in number to include in any meaningful statistical 1545 See for example: Chandler (1987), Dokladal (1969, 1970), Gralla (1964, 1965), Grosskopf (1989), Grupe and Herrmann (1983), Herrmann (1972a, 1972b, 1976, 1977a, 1977b), Hoick (1986), Hummel and Schutkowski (1986), Ramrakhiani, Pal and Datta (1980), Shipman, Foster and Schoeninger (1984) and Wahl (1982). 1546 Greece: see Breitinger (1939), Davaras (1973), Gams (1982), Musgrave (1980, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1990a, 1990b), Paidoussis and Sbarounis (1975, 1979), Pitsios (1987), Robinson (1942), Stampolidis (1990), Xirotiris (1982) and Xirotiris and Langenscheidt (198 1).

Because of their particular interest they have been treated separately, along with the SM inhumations, in Section 2 of this chapter. METHODS Information was collected on: degree of cremation (colour, texture, degree of warping, shrinkage, etc.); postcranial fragment length; weight of bone recovered; number of individuals in each urn; sex; age at death; pathology; urn goods; animal and fish bones; shells; minerals; and organic remains.1547 RESULTS The figures quoted in the MATERIAL section above offer some idea of the sheer quantity of bone recovered and available for study. However it is neither necessary nor possible to publish here a detailed description of the contents of each pot or bag. A typescript catalogue, in four bound volumes, on specially prepared pro forma sheets (TABLE 25) has been deposited in the Library of the British School at Athens. There are additional sets in London and Bristol. Readers seeking further information are welcome to consult one of these sets. Table 25.

MUSGRAVE Discussion This is restricted to a discussion of a few selected topics of both anthropological and archaeological interest. Amplification of some of them, and the evidence adduced to support certain theories, can be found in a collation of the master catalogue, reproduced here as the Appendix. Not all the observations recorded in it have the same weight or importance. Nevertheless it sometimes happens that an observation made simply because it seemed strange and interesting at the time, later becomes important in the light of further discoveries. SEX Both sexes were represented. This is not such a banal statement as it may sound. Segregation of the sexes even in death is not unheard of. I believe, for instance, that the human remains excavated at Myrtos Pyrgos, Southern Crete, contained a disproportionately large number of men. Because it is unwise to place too great reliance upon sex determinations made on fragmentary and incomplete material, no attempt has been made to estimate sex-ratios. AGE As with the data on sex, it was not possible to assemble any accurate tables on total life expectancy or infant mortality. This was largely because, again, assessments had to be made macroscopically on damaged and incomplete portions of diagnostically important regions. We had neither the time nor the facilities to attempt any histological or chemical tests.1548 Their application to cremated remains is apparently still not widespread or always successful.1549 Nevertheless it is clear that individuals of all ages, with the exception of babies and very young children, were represented in the cemetery. For example a 9-10 year old child was found in 285; 107.13 contained the patellae of another child; 13.33 75»i3* IO7«59 and 285.33 contained remains of adolescents or young adults; and 285.13 the edentulous mandible of a very old woman. The apparent absence of babies and very young children could be attributed to poor preservation or our failure to spot them, a suggestion that I do not favour. The material on the whole is very well preserved and I have found and studied cremated baby remains from elsewhere: one from Lower Gypsades; one from Nea Mihaniona; and five from Torone.1550 The Torone material is very relevant. Having been buried at plough-share depth it had suffered some disturbance during the past three millennia. Nevertheless Professor Cambitoglou and his colleagues recovered from the PG cemetery there c. 107 bone-bearing pots, of which five contained babies less than a year old, and seven children between one and twelve years old. Of 74 individuals represented among the Lefkandi PG-SPG Cemetery cremations seven were young persons.1551 In the absence - or rather deliberate omission - of an age distribution histogram, interested readers may accept the 'Young individuals/old individuals' section in the Appendix as a useful substitute. It is merely a list of those collections to which an age label, in most cases regrettably vague, could be attached. 1548 Described by Kerley (1965, 1970), Ahlquist and Damstem (1969), Ascenzi (1969), Singh and Gunberg (1970), Kiszely (1974), Ubelaker (1974, 1984, 1986), Bouvier and Ubelaker (1977), Herrmann (1977a), Kerley and Ubelaker (1978), Uytterschaut (1985) and Stout (1989, 1992).

In time it may be possible to establish consanguinity from traces of DNA and blood remaining in less well burnt bone.155* In cremated remains the search is hampered by the incompleteness and damaged condition of the material. Only one isolated example of possible consanguinity was observed among the KNC bones. I refer to the presence on three mandibular fragments from 36, 58 and 79 in T. 285 of a peculiar, apparently functionless ridge, called a torus mandibularis, an uncommon and supposedly hereditary, familial trait (FIG. 194 d). DOUBLE BURIALS Information on the burial in one pot of the remains of at least two individuals is of interest to students of ritual and funerary practice.1554 However, we do not at present know whether the second or nth individual was popped inside 10 or 100 years after the previous one;1555 and statistics on the prevalence of this practice are still scanty. Nevertheless double burials need not be difficult to identify; and we have evidence of some spectacular ones, both archaeological and literary.1556 Among the KNC bone-bearing urns only two possible examples were observed (Tombs 28,5 and 107.13). There is evidence that the SM Tomb 201 contained three individuals. However, the massive collection of bones from this Tomb -2.388 kg: the heaviest KNC collection - were probably committed in a perishable container and not an urn. They are discussed separately. Of the eleven pots from Lower Gypsades two contained double burials.1557 At Torone likewise only two out of 107 bone-bearing pots contained double burials.1558 At Lefkandi there was evidence of two double burials.1559 At Perati five of the twelve cremations described are said to be double and one triple.1560 Examples of a later age can be cited from Nea Mihaniona and Derveni.1561 1552 Brothwell (1981); Scarre (1984). 1553 See for example: Berry (1979); Berry and Berry (1967, 1972); Berry, Berry and Ucko (1967); Rightmire (1972); Corrucini (1974, 1976); Sjovold (1975, 1976-77); Finnegan (1978); Trinkaus (1978); Cheverud, Buikstra and Twichell (1979); Molto (1979); Perizonius (1979); Musgrave and Evans (1980); Brothwell (1981); Kaul and Pathak (1984); Rothammer, Quevedo, Cocüovo and Llop (1984); Czarnetzki (1985); and, especially, Powell (1989). For DNA see Brown, O'Donoghue and Brown (1995). For albumin see Cattaneo (1994) and Cattaneo et al. (1994). 1554 For a discussion of this practice in Ancient Greece see, among others, Kurtz and Boardman (1971), Snodgrass (1971), Dickinson (1983), Garland (1985) and Morris (1987). 1555 Both Gladykowska-Rzeczycka (1974) and Hazzledine (1982) have drawn attention to the near impossibility of deciding whether the double or multiple occupants of a single urn were cremated and interred simultaneously. 1556 Though admittedly of very different periods. Archaeological: the double burial in the Derveni Crater. See Musgrave (1990b). Literary: the burial of Patroclus and Achilles. It is described by Homer, starting with the passage in Iliad xxiii in which Achules gave clear instructions that Patroclus' bones should be carefully collected from the centre of his pyre and then placed in a gold 'phiale' 'against the time when I myself shall have vanished in the world below.9 (E.V Rieu's translation of line 244. The whole passage is in Iliad xxiii, 236-248.) Later, in Odyssey xxiv the spirit of Agamemnon addresses Achilles' and describes the details of his cremation and the subsequent committal of his ashes in a golden amphora - the handiwork of Hephaestus and a gift from Dionysus - alongside those of Patroclus. 'In this lie your white bones, glorious Achilles, and mingled with them those of the dead Patroclus, son of Menoiteus'. (See E.V Rieu's translation of Odyssey xxiv, 73-77.) 1557 Musgrave (1981). 1558 Musgrave: final report awaiting publication. 1559 Musgrave (1980). 1560 Paidoussis and Sbarounis (1975). 1561 Musgrave (1990b).</page><page sequence="392">682 J- H- MUSGRAVE Why it should have been necessary to bury two individuals in one pot is not known. The practice was not confined, as one might expect, to the burial of one adult (mother?) and a child. At Torone, however, one of the two double burials was indeed that of a mother and her newborn baby. The Derveni crater contained the remains of an adult man and woman. Tomb II at Nea Mihaniona contained those of a mother and her newborn baby (Musgrave 1990b). Perhaps it is unwise to attribute too much significance to the presence of several individuals in one pot. We have no evidence of simultaneous death and burial. The explanation may be no more dramatic than that it was regarded as perfectly acceptable to place the remains of a widow alongside those of her late husband, or vice versa. Paidoussis and Sbarounis (1975) imply that something of the kind may have happened at Perati. The bones in the Derveni crater point to a similar conclusion (Musgrave 1990b). An example of the evidence indicating the presence of two individuals in one pot is illustrated in PLATE 313 b. On it are reproduced two right squamous temporal fragments and a left and right petrous temporal bone, each of different size. At the Anglo-Saxon cemetery site of Spong Hill in Norfolk, where 2262 individuals were identified, 4.5 % of the collections contained remains of two individuals, in a wide range of permutations.1562 Among a Norwegian sample of e. 1100 cremations, double - and a few triple - burials amounted to 4.4% (n = 48). 1563 In the Bronze Age cremation cemeteries at Simons Ground, Dorset, 19 out of 119 (16%) urns contained the bones of two individuals: either an adult or young adult and a child.1564 Of the 72 'kaiserzeitlichen' urns from Reppentin, Kreis Lubz, Mecklenberg, five (7%) contained two individuals.1565 Occasionally, at other sites, the bones of one individual were divided between two, and even three, containers.1566 Elsewhere in Europe, according to one authority, multiple cremations are 'comparatively rare'.1567 This is not a view shared by others1568 who have sought to demonstrate that 'Such deposits are relatively common occurrences at British Bronze Age burial sites...'.1569 GENERAL PATHOLOGY Many causes of death - viral and bacterial infection, heart diseases and some malignancies - leave no trace on the skeleton. Tuberculosis, the treponematoses and fatal trauma, of course, do. The most common pathological lesions visible on any collection of ancient bones are likely to be those of the arthropathies and the haemoglobinopathies, especially anaemia. Instances of both are listed in the Appendix. (i) Anaemia For many years anthropologists have been interested in the presence of anaemia in ancient communities. Anaemia can be either acquired or congenital. If it was acquired its presence may offer some idea of standards of nutrition and hygiene prevalent in the community under 1562 McKinley (iq8qd, 2A&lt;'. »563 Hoick (iq86, 164). 1564 Hazzledine (1982). 1565 Grimm (iq8&lt;0. 1566 Two: (McKinley 1989b, 245).

See too Kühl (1983c). 1568 Petersen, Shepherd and Tuckwell (1974). 1569 For further information on the occurrence of multiple cremations in Britain see Shepherd and Cowie (1977), Petersen (1981) and McKinley (1989a).</page><page sequence="393">THE HUMAN BONES 683 examination. Among peoples occupying malarial areas the possibility that one of the congenital anaemias - sickle-cell anaemia or thalassaemia - was involved also has to be borne in mind. Why? Because it has been known for a long time that each of them can afford a degree of protection against the worse ravages of malaria as the plasmodial parasite is unable to prosper in the already damaged red blood cells of those suffering from milder forms of both these anaemias.1570 Whereas it would be interesting to know whether these Early Iron Age Cretans were afflicted with malaria, it has to be admitted that it is impossible to state confidently that they were. That is because it is almost impossible to determine whether the anaemia from which they may or may not have suffered was congenital or acquired. A few years ago, simply because Greece was known to be a malarial area in antiquity, it was assumed that congenital anaemia was more prevalent than acquired. Recent work, however, suggests that acquired anaemia, in particular iron-deficiency anaemia, may have brought about more of the associated skeletal changes than the congenital form.1571 The evidence for the suggestion - no more - that one of the haemoglobinopathies may have been endemic at Knossos is the presence among the bones recovered of: (i) quite a number of cranial vault fragments more than 8.0 mm thick; (ii) traces of osteoporosis on others; (iii) several orbital roof fragments displaying undoubted signs of cribra orbitalia.1012 Ten vault fragments were found to be thicker than 8.0 mm (range: 8.0-1 1. o mm). Changes to the cranial diploë were noted in fifteen. Six orbital roofs seemingly showed traces of cribra orbitalia. See the Appendix.1573 However, one should not forget that: (i) the haemolytic anaemias are not the only cause of thickening of the cranial diploë; and (ii) diagnosing any disease on the evidence of signs on broken fragments from a restricted area of the skeleton is risky, to say the least. For example it is not always clear on ancient cranial vault fragments whether the thickening was the result of: (i) thickening of the diploë and thinning of the outer table (porotic hyperostosis), as seen in the anaemias;1574 or (ii) thickening of both outer and inner tables at the expense of the diploë, as seen in Paget's disease.1575 1570 Readers interested in this subject should consult Moseley (1965), Angel (1967), Satinoff (1972), Steinbock (1976), Hillson (1980), Musgrave (1980), Ortner and Putschar (1985), McGeorge (1983) and, especially, Grmek (1989). Grmek's encyclopaedic account contains references to many classic papers on the subject, including those of Haldane, Allison and Angel. 1571 For a discussion of recent thinking on congenital us acquired anaemia see Stuart-Macadam (1988, 1989). See too Carlson et al. (1974). 1572 For information about cribra orbitalia see Steinbock (1976), Hillson (1980) and Brothwell (1 981). For a discussion of the condition on Iron Age cremated crania from North Germany see Kühl (1980, 1983c, 1983e, 1985). See too again Stuart-Macadam (1989). In this paper she reviews convincing evidence that microbial infection arising from poor hygiene may have been the major factor causing cribra orbitalia rather than poor diet. 1573 Whether any form of anaemia was endemic at Torone was not easy to determine as the cremated and inhumed remains told different stories. For example among the cremated bones no instances of osteoporosis or cribra orbitalia were observed; and few cranial vault fragments showed signs of abnormal thickness. Indeed only two tombs yielded vault fragments thicker than 8.0 mm:Tomb 76 (c. 8.0 mm); Tomb 70 (8.4, 8.5, 9.3 mm). Scores were also recorded on vault fragments from Tombs 22, 25, 30, 41, 42, 55???, 60, 75, 77, 86, 103, 104, n8:II, 122, 124, 128 and 130. These ranged from 2.9 to 7.4 mm. If seventeen samples yielded relatively low scores one is left with the impression that this community was not prone to conditions that led to thickening of the cranial vault (Musgrave, final report awaiting publication). 1574 Steinbock (1976). 1575 A gross oversimplification. See Ortner and Putschar (*985, 309-315) for a detailed description of the signs of Paget's disease.</page><page sequence="394">684 J- H- MUSGRAVE Even in healthy individuals skull thickness is 'extremely variable'.1576 At Helgö (Sweden) mean cranial thickness for males was only 4.21 mm and for females 3.68 mm.1577 Those of the Minoan male and female skeletons from Ailias Hill were 5.7 mm and 5.1 mm thick respectively.1578 At Loveden Hill, Lincolnshire, maximum thickness was less than 8.0 mm, and the mean very much lower than that.1579 Very low scores - 2.2 to 3.4 mm and 2.6 to 3.8 mm - have been recorded for two mature cremated Iron Age males from north Germany.1580 The cranium of a third - mature female - individual from that region was rather thicker: 6.9 to 7.0 mm.1581 Scores of up to 6.7 and 7.0 mm have also been recorded on two other north German adult crania.1582 Elsewhere in Germany other seemingly low scores for skull thickness in cremated crania have also been recorded, with few cases exceeding 8 mm.1583 However, there are grounds for believing that the cranial vault bones of the so-called Queen of Lefkandi were pathologically thick: frontais 9-10 mm; parietais 9.5-10.5 mm.1584 At the top end of the scale Angel (1967) recorded 'Neolithic pre-Greek adults with vaults up to 19 mm thick'.1585 It is perhaps worth recording that skull thickness was apparently low in some illustrious cremated Macedonians of a later age: Vergina Tomb II Antechamber (4-6 mm); Vergina Tomb III (3-4 mm); Derveni Tomb Beta (male: 4.3-7.1 mm; female: 2.9-5.2 mm); Nea Mihaniona II (8.2 mm); Nea Mihaniona III ('Bones generally thin').1586 (ii) Arthropathies Traditionally anthropologists record signs of arthropathies.1587 Not long ago most of us tended to apply the blanket term 'arthritis' to every manifestation of change whether to the articular surface or to the periarticular bone. As interest in palaeopathology grew among practising rheumatologists it became clear that the range of joint pathology manifested in ancient bones was as wide as it is in the living, and equally difficult to diagnose precisely. Non-clinical anthropologists like myself then adopted less specific terms such as 'degenerative joint disease' (DJD). Even this cautious approach is not entirely satisfactory as non-degenerative conditions can be mistaken for degenerative on dry, ancient bone. In due course we may be well advised to refer to undiagnosable pathological changes to joints simply as 'undiagnosable arthropathies'. This is likely to apply to cremations in particular where few individual bones, let alone the whole skeleton, are complete.1588 Because only a relatively small amount of the N Cemetery bone came from undisturbed pots, a list of individual lesions would be impractical as no conclusions about prevalence could be drawn. Instead the reader is advised to refer to the Appendix where nearly twenty possible instances are recorded. It should not be thought that haemoglobinopathies and arthropathies, despite what has 1576 Krogman (1962). 1577 Gejvall and Persson (1970). 1578 McGeorge (personal communication). »579 Wilkinson (1980). «580 See Kühl and Remagen (1986) and Kühl (1988). issi See Kühl (1983a). 15ß2 See Kühl (1983e, 76-78). 1583 See Table ia in Grimm (1974) and Table 2 in Grimm (1985). 1584 Musgrave (1982, unpublished report). 1585 For more information on skull thickness see Todd (1924), Twiesselman (1941), Roche (1953), Vallois (1958) and Getz (i960). 1586 See Musgrave (1990a, 1990b). 1587 For descnptions of arthropathies on cremated bone see Kühl (1983a, 1983c, 1983e, 1985, 1988) and Kühl and Remagen (1986). 1588 As Rogers, Waldron, Dieppe and Watt (1987) have explained: 'It is important to consider the skeleton in its entirety, and a valid classification cannot be made from the examination of single sets of joints or single elements of the skeleton.' See too Rogers and Waldron (1995).</page><page sequence="395">THE HUMAN BONES 685 been written above, are the only conditions that leave their marks on cremated bone. Many inflammatory conditions and neoplasms do; but the chances of observing them on burnt bones are understandably reduced, though not to zero.1589 ORAL PATHOLOGY From inhumed loose teeth, jaw fragments and whole jaws it is possible to tabulate useful information about ante mortem tooth loss, wear, résorption and the prevalence of caries and abscesses among the occupants of a given cemetery. Even though fragments of enamel1590 are occasionally recovered (PLATE 313 c), the only pathological lesions likely to be seen on cremated teeth are carious cavities severe enough to have penetrated the underlying dentine. Even when that happens, there may remain some doubt about the accuracy of the diagnosis as the dentine core may also have been damaged during burning. Nevertheless, that the level of oral hygiene among the cremated occupants of this cemetery was not very high is indicated by the discovery of at least seven jaw fragments displaying traces of abscesses and by signs of caries on at least eleven loose teeth (see the Appendix). It would be unwise, however, to read too much into these figures. One would expect to find a fair sprinkling of abscesses in the jaws of skeletons of this date, and the number seen is probably neither significantly high nor low. As Brothwell has stressed, their prevalence varies greatly from population to population and age to age. Interestingly 'British groups from Neolithic times onwards show remarkably constant and low frequencies'. (Brothwell 1981, 157). Data on the prevalence of dental sepsis in ancient Cretan jaws are not extensive. Carr (i960) recorded that 4.9% of the Middle Minoan jaws from Ailias, Knossos, had abscessed sockets. This compares with scores of 3.2% for material from Myrtos Pyrgos (Musgrave: unpublished data); 2.5% for Armenoi (McGeorge 1983); and 0.88% for the occupants of an Early Christian osteotheke at Knossos (Musgrave 1976). 1591 Burial Customs It is quite clear from the colour, texture and size of the individual bone fragments, and from the weight, of some of the collections deposited in whole pots that these ancient Knossians performed the tasks of burning and burying their dead with great efficiency and commendable thoroughness. The evidence adduced for their efficiency is the colour of most of the bone fragments. As all the authorities cited above have stressed, at 900o C the organic content of bone is all but destroyed, leaving only the inorganic matrix which, at that temperature, is rendered brittle, and assumes a metallic and vitreous consistency rather like fine bone china. On cooling it is also very white. Indeed it is this brilliant hue that offers the most reliable clue as to the temperature reached at the hottest part of the pyre. Modern cremation ovens operate at 900o 1589 As Ingrid Kühl has demonstrated in many lavishly illustrated papers. See, for example, Kühl (1983e, 1985, 1988) and Kühl and Remagen (1986). 1590 Examples have also been recorded by Denston (1977a, 1981b), Kühl (1980, 1983e). Lunt and Barnetson (1982, 92) have described the recovery of two molar crowns which survived cremation because they had not yet erupted. See too Chandler (1987) and McKinley (1989b) for a discussion of dental pathology in cremated teeth. 1591 Comparative figures on ancient Greek dental and oral pathology are obtainable in Angel (1944, 1971 and 1973), and in my forthcoming final report on the Torone material. At Torone only two abscessed sockets were recorded among the cremated jaw fragments.</page><page sequence="396">686 J- H. MUSGRAVE C and their products differ little in colour and texture from the most completely consumed remains from an ancient pyre. In general the N Cemetery bones were well burnt. Each collection did of course contain a proportion of grey and even brown fragments. A pyre is not uniformly hot throughout, and one would expect certain regions of the body - the vertebral column and back of the skull for example - to emerge less well burnt than more superficial or less well covered ones (provided of course that the body was placed on the pyre supine and remained in that position throughout most of the proceedings). Other parts would drop off and might land on the periphery of the pyre where they would remain only charred unless spotted and tossed back into the blazing centre. There is evidence of elbows, for example, remaining less well burnt from Nea Mihaniona II and III and Derveni Beta.1592 In general, however, the N Cemetery bones were well burnt, the brittle white fragments outnumbering the brown less well burnt ones. Following the actual burning of the body, those responsible for committing the remains did so with commendable zeal. Indeed words like 'thoroughness', 'fastidiousness' and 'attention to detail' do not seem out of place. Evidence is supplied by the weights of the individual urn burials; and by the recovery, in many of them, of large quantities of small, easily overlooked pieces such as tooth roots and finger phalanges. Let us examine the evidence more closely. It is perhaps reasonable to conclude that a community which consistently collects and buries several hundred grams of bone in an urn takes a different view of the rite from another which is happy to pick up a few scraps as a token gesture. That the N Cemetery cremations are the heaviest of the small series of pre-Classical Greek cremations with which I am most familiar is, I suggest, noteworthy. See TABLE 26 and ILL. 15. Table 26. Some data on weights of individual urn burials (in grammes). A = median, B = mean, C = standard deviation, D = sample size, E = range.

Thirty-eight of the N Cemetery seventy-four individual urn burials weighed more than 600 g. This is an exceptionally high figure. Frequently the majority from any prehistoric European site weighs very much less than that. Indeed, only 2 of the 52 Lefkandi cremations weighed more than that figure, with scores of 858 g and 1912 g respectively (Musgrave 1980). 1592 See Musgrave (1990b). 1593 Paidoussis and Sbaroums (1975).

Weight frequency histogram of the individual urn cremations from KNC plotted against comparative data from Torone to demonstrate the higher scores from KNC Further evidence of the thoroughness with which the mourners gathered up the burnt bones from the pyre is the presence in several pots of some very small and seemingly insignificant pieces. For example 75.7 contained more than fifty tooth root fragments (PLATE 313 d) and even a few tooth enamel fragments (PLATE 313 c).1595 Pot 107.27 contained much of the right side of the lower jaw (restored from three broken pieces) and more than ten tooth root fragments (PLATE 313 e). But perhaps the most interesting of the easily overlooked pieces are seven finger phalanges from 107.29 (PLATES 313/and 314 a). To the casual observer they might look, in monochrome, exactly like any other hand bones from any other grave. Their interest and significance lie in the fact that they were completely cremated - of that there is no doubt - and that someone took the trouble to gather them up for burial. One can of course argue that the mourners may simply have shovelled the 'ash' on to a large sieve, shaken it and then transferred to an urn what remained. What makes that unlikely is the rarity of large chunks of charcoal - which would almost certainly have found their way into the sieve - and the relative abundance of large chunks of bone. Any sieving procedure would be expected to diminish the number of large and identifiable pieces recovered. I think that it was the custom at Knossos at that time for the pyre residue to be sifted in situ and for great care to be taken not to exclude any 1595 See n. 1590 above. Shipman, Foster and Schoeninger (1984) have also published interesting observations about burnt tooth enamel.</page><page sequence="398">688 J- H- MUSGRAVE pieces simply on the grounds of their small size. It can have been no easy job. Finding tooth roots and finger phalanges among the rest of the bones from any given pot, even with the help of forceps, paintbrush, air puffer, patience, time and expertise, is a laborious business. Was it not more so for those who selected and sorted the material for burial in the first place? In contrast to the recovery of very small pieces is the abundance of very large ones. For example Scorn 75.72 came enough separate pieces to reassemble much of the forehead and left eye socket (orbit) of the dead subject (FIG. 194 ¿). Other interesting cranial fragments came from 285.12 (fig. 194/)- 1*1 this case however, although they reunited perfectly, it is clear from the difference in colour and hence degree of burning that they had become separated earlier on during combustion; and that the recovery of the relevant portions of this subject's forehead and left orbital roof was coincidental. Further proof that separation of adjacent pieces of bone during burning did not preclude their ultimate reunion in the urn is provided by the discovery among a loose collection from T. 107 of one black and one white fragment of occipital bone from the vicinity of the external occipital protuberance (PLATE 314 b). The presence of large pieces that join, or neariy join, indicates thoroughness in exactly the same way that the inclusion of tooth roots does. Large and small alike were not overlooked. The presence of large numbers of large chunks also throws light on another aspect of funerary procedure. The preponderance of very small limb bone fragments from other sites has prompted some authors to suggest that the deliberate pounding of the remains after collection and before burial was widespread in antiquity.1596 Examples of some large postcranial and cranial pieces are illustrated in PLATES 314 c-d. A more objective approach to this problem is, of course, to record and plot the frequencies of the length of the longest postcranial fragment (LOLPCF) from any given collection of cremated bones. A glance at TABLE 27 and ILL. 16 in this report, Figures c and d in Musgrave (1980) and Figure 12.2 in Wilkinson (1980) will confirm that limb bone fragment length was particularly high among the larger collections of N. Cemetery bone. (Because small, i.e. light, collections are not likely to contain a wide range of bone fragments from each region of the skeleton, only LOLPCF scores from the larger N. Cemetery collections, viz. weighing more than 200 g, were included for comparison with data from other sites. This procedure, though probably pushing up the median and mean by a point or two, nevertheless should give a more realistic idea of postcranial fragment length in the whole series.) Table 27.

LOLPCF-length of longest postcranial fragment-frequency histogram of collections of bones from KNC weighing more than 250 g plotted against comparative data from Torone to demonstrate the higher scores from KNC. There are few grounds for believing that these ancient Knossians saw any need to reduce the burnt remains of their dead to unrecognisable fragments, but were content with the action of fire on them, a ritual act in its own right. It is misguided to relate ancient practices and beliefs to modern ones. In Western Europe today we have a horror of death and seek to dispose of our dead as swiftly, hygienically and anonymously as possible. We expect to have their cremated remains handed to us as a kilogram or two of 'cremulated' dust wrapped in a polythene bag and placed inside a simulated bronze plastic urn. We should not on that account, however, read our own beliefs and expectations into those of our forebears. There is indeed sound evidence that Greeks, ancient and modern, were and are much less squeamish about the sight and touch of skeletal remains, whether cremated or macerated in the ground. To take cremated remains first. The N Cemetery cremations and others from Lower Gypsades, Perati and Torone all contained large chunks of bone that could have been reduced to powder with a heavy stone or sandalled foot. This is particularly true of the remains of Macedonian grandees from Vergina, Nea Mihaniona and Derveni.1597 1597 Lower Gypsades (Musgrave 1981); Perati (Figs. 1-22 in Paidoussis and Sbarounis 1975); Torone (Musgrave: final report awaiting publication); Vergina, Nea Mihaniona and Derveni (Prag, Musgrave and Neave. 1984; Musgrave 1990a and 1990b).</page><page sequence="400">6go J- H. MUSGRAVE Inhumed, naturally macerated skeletal remains have evoked a similar matter-of-fact response throughout Greek history. The use of communal tomb and ossuary in prehistoric times is too well known to require detailed documentation here. At the opposite end of the time-scale should perhaps be cited the custom in modern Greece of burying a body and then exhuming the remains after three years and depositing them in an ossuary.1598 I should perhaps end my contribution at this point. However, a few interesting cultural remains were found among the human and should perhaps be mentioned briefly for completeness, and because they also cast light on contemporary burial customs. In addition to the bronze, iron, stone, bone and clay objects discussed elsewhere, I should like to draw attention to three finds which could easily have been overlooked. I refer to the presence of cloth impressions (see PLATES 314 e-f). These, with the recovery from T.107 of an almost microscopic fragment of cloth, measuring 6.0 mm X 2.5 mm, confirm that it was indeed customary to wrap the cremated remains - while they were still damp? - in a cloth before depositing them in their final resting place.1599 These instances, trivial in themselves, should be added to those of traces of cloth inside metal urns from Attica, the magnificent robe from Lefkandi, and the purple cloth-of-gold that wrapped the burnt bones from the antechamber to Tomb II at Vergina.1600 The abundance of animal bones, shells and even the tooth of a shark or ray (from T. 107) similarly suggest that offerings were made and perhaps feasts held. As ever, however, caution is required. Whereas it is quite likely that many of the animal bones derive from funeral feasting, it is not possible by simply looking at them to determine whether the marine fauna are fossil intrusions or came with the small pebbles that were strewn on some tomb floors. I have even wondered whether some of the shells and pebbles, combined with the relative scarceness of charcoal (but see PLATE 314 g), may offer some clues as to where the actual cremation took place. Given the dangers involved in lighting a large and fierce fire anywhere in Greece between June and October, might it not be conceivable that the proceedings sometimes took place on a river bank or the sea shore? CONCLUSIONS Of the N Cemetery Geometric cremations it can be said that, with the exception of babies and very young children, all ages and both sexes were cremated and committed together; that the bodies were generally well burnt; that probably little attempt was made to reduce the bones in size; that the amount of bone collected from the pyre was impressive compared with the roughly contemporary collections from Lefkandi and Torone; that the urn goods were rather more opulent - knife handles, pins, beads, a terracotta figurine, fragments of glass - than the homely sea-urchins and bronze rings from Torone. In some hypothetical prehistoric league table I should place them in top place, ahead of Perati and way ahead of Torone and Lefkandi. Are they a reflection of greater prosperity in the community at large? The absence of cremated babies and very young children may be significant. Given the huge volume of bone recovered and the fact that baby bones are well represented elsewhere, I should have expected to find a few. How they were disposed of remains a matter for speculation. 1598 Danforth (1982). 1599 SeeJ. Cocking, Textile Remains', ch. 15. 1600 Attica (Kurtz and Boardman 1971); Lefkandi (Sackett and Carington Smith 1980; Popham, Touloupa and Sackett 1982); Vergina (Andronicos 1978, 1980, 1984).</page><page sequence="401">THE HUMAN BONES 691 SECTION 2: THE SUBMINOAN HUMAN REMAINS Because of the importance of both the inhumations and cremations of this period, I have described the individual collections from each tomb in detail. T, 2. Six bags of material were recovered, from which were identified: Dromos: Two burnt limb bones, the longer 43.0 mm. Wt. 4 g. 27 burnt frs. (one cranial, 26 postcranial). Wt. 8og (cranial 5 g) of an adult, sex unknown. Longest postcranial fr. 55.5 mm. Chamber. One unburnt limb fr., L. 39.3 mm. Two unburnt limb frs. (tibia and fibula), the longer 61.6 mm. Pot 1: c. 43 burnt frs. (eight cranial) weighing 81 g (cranial 12 g), of an adult female? Longest postcranial fr. 58.6 mm. Others: Four unburnt limb frs. (longest, 54 mm). T.16. An inhumation comprising uninformative frs. of an adult of unknown age and sex; a few cranial, one postcranial. T.40. From the floor deposit came (a) a bagful of very broken, fragile unburnt cranial and postcranial frs., and ten loose teeth, from at least two, or perhaps three young adults (slightly ambivalent context, not included in Table 28); (b) one cranial, one postcranial fr., burnt. L. of latter, 69.2 mm. Wt. 15 g. T.i 12. Remains of an inhumation, including some large skull and limb bone frs. as well as five loose teeth (a |6? and four front teeth). The degree of attrition on all of them suggested that their owner was 25-35 years old at death (Brothwell, 1981). T.I2I. Skeleton I Sex/Age: Male (skull; chin profile; left femoral head, diameter 47.4 mm), possibly no more than 35 (dental attrition: Brothwell 1981). Pathology: (i) Dental: L3, L4, 6l and 7I carious; root abscesses associated with |_3 and 7I; |_7 was lost before death, and |_8, ¿1 and 16 may have been. Despite this pathology, the teeth were not very worn and they looked like those of a man in the prime of life, (ii) General: holes, possibly pathological, observed on a right radial and an unsided fibular fragment. The greater trochanter on the left femur may also have been cut, but that is far from certain. Skeleton II Sex/Age: Female? (left femoral head diameter, c. 41.5 mm; right femoral bicondylar breadth, 73.7 mm). But certain areas of the skull (external occipital protuberance; supraorbital region; mastoid processes) looked male. A rugged lady? Probably less than 25. Pathology: Diploë of cranial vault thickened? Parietal thickness, 7.9 mm. Far from certain. Neither orbital roof preserved. Thus there is no evidence for cribra orbitalia. Dentition: No caries. Roots of both upper 7s perforated into maxillary antrum: tips visible in floor. |_7 had four roots. Skeleton III Sex/Age: Less than six (squamous and basilar portions of occipital bone not fused). Pathology: Traces of cribra orbitalia in roofs of both orbits. T.149. A. Inhumed remains comprised the fragmentary and incomplete skeleton of a young mature male of unknown age. Sex was determined from the ruggedness of certain parts of the skull and the presence of particularly stout fibrous flexor sheaths on some hand proximal phalanges. Age was estimated from an unworn upper molar tooth (6j ?) and the patency of his cranial sutures. An age estimate based on a single tooth and sutural closure can scarcely be 100% reliable. His jaws and teeth were not very informative. Three loose teeth. Cervical caries distally on 6j ?. B. 229 g of not very well burnt frs. (cranial 24 g) belonging to a mature adult of unknown age (longest postcranial fragment, 68.7 mm.) were loose in the upper fill, very doubtfully of SM date. T.153. Contained the very poorly preserved inhumed skeleton of an individual of unknown sex, aged between 25-35 years (dental attrition: Brothwell 1981). Twenty one loose teeth. Caries on [8, [5 and an unidentified root stump. T.160. Contained the very poorly preserved and far from complete inhumed skeleton of a male past the prime of life. Sex was determined from a fairly pronounced supramastoid crest and longish mastoid process on his right temporal bone. The fact that his mandible was edentulous as far forward as and including 5I and [5 suggested that he was not young when he died. Nine loose teeth. Caries on 5J.

Contained 743 g of quite well cremated bone (cranial 84 g; jaws and teeth 9 g) belonging to a not very old and perhaps lightly built male (unworn lower premolar enamel fragment; small genial tubercles on mandible). Some interesting small fragments; semicircular canals; hamulus of left? hamate. T.200. I have described collection of cremated bones in Ts. 200, 201 in greater detail, in view of the importance of the tombs. Condition and colour: Frs. predominantly white, i.e. well burnt. Bones all very clean. Were they washed at some time? Fragment size: On the whole rather small. Length of longest postcranial fragment 44.8 mm. The small size of many fragments suggests that the burnt bones may have been fairly roughly treated at some time. But the recovery of several complete hand bones indicated that no attempt had been made to reduce everything to dust. Weights: Total 467 g (skull, jaws and teeth 30 g; hand 7 g). Probably a single individual. Sex/ Age: Female (or very small male) on evidence of: two very small hamuli of right and left hamates; small coronoid process of mandible; small thoracic? vertebral body (only 16.4 mm high); two small thumb distal phalanges. Not very old. Pathology: None seen. Animal bones and shells: Several shell fragments were recovered, including a whole Limai shell. Fossil? Or was the cremation performed on the sea shore? T.201. A rather complicated cremation, taken up in two bags, of which Bag 1 contained white stones and very small bone fragments. Bag 2: large bone frs. and practically no stones. To judge from the urn goods found in the two bags, I am certain that all the bones came from one large cremation. Condition and colour: Frs. predominantly white, i.e. well burnt. Fragment size: Longest postcranial fr., 76.6 mm. Weights: Total 2388 g (skull: adult 260 g; baby or child 1 1 g; jaws and teeth 23 g; hands and feet 24 g; rest of skeleton 2070 g). At least two individuals represented, on the evidence of the recovery of three petrous temporal bones, two of which were of the same side. Possibly three, if these belonged to two adults and the small cranial frs. to a small child. Sex/ Age: The available evidence is very ambiguous and hard to interpret. For example an adult chin fragment possessed a female profile. On the other hand part of a left frontal bone showed that the anterior end of the inferior temporal line had perhaps given rise to a well developed temporalis muscle - a very male trait. If there were three individuals in the tomb - two adults and a child - then we might be considering the remains of a small family comprising father, mother and one child. The weight of bone recovered - the heaviest of all the N Cemetery cremations - would not rule out this possibility. At least one individual was a young adult on the evidence of (i) the trace of an epiphysial line observed on a cancellous bone fragment; and (ii) the absence of signs of degenerative disease on the vertebral bodies. There were also some small skull bones of a baby or small child. Pathology: None seen. Animal bones and shells: c. 12 shell frs., including two whole Lima? shells, were found. T.202. Contained a gram or so of completely uninformative burnt bone. T.282. The two burnt limb bones (Wt. 10 g) in the fill were probably alien. DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSIONS The inhumed SM remains were far too poorly preserved and the individuals they represented too few in number to allow any reliable statements to be made concerning adult sex ratios, stature, life expectancy, etc. For all that they are an interesting collection, as are the cremations. The one from T. 201 was bigger than any from the Geometric tombs. There is also clear evidence - lacking elsewhere - from T. 201 of the cremation of a baby or small child. That two tombs (T. 121 and T. 201) apparently contained a young man, a young woman and a child is interesting and perhaps important.

Wall-Crowther The faunal remains from the cemetery comprise several animal skeletons from certain tombs, and smaller quantities of bones from other tombs which probably represent food offerings rather than burials of whole animals. The preservation of the bones is rather poor, being much eroded and friable. This is the result of the soil conditions. All bone is unburnt unless stated otherwise. The bones are considered below, in alphabetical or numerical order of the tombs from which they came. Tomb F Animal bones were recovered from two separate areas. The skeleton of an ox was found in a shallow depression north-west of the dromos. The ox bones are in a good state of preservation, and may well be modern. For this reason, they are not considered further. (They are, however, retained in the Stratigraphical Museum.) From a nearby pit came the poorly preserved skeletons of two equids, and a few other animal bones. The equid bones are very fragmentary and their surfaces have been much eroded. For these reasons, few measurements could be taken. However, some information could be gained. Two individuals are represented. They are not noticeably different in size, on the basis of the surviving limb bone fragments. It has, therefore, not been possible to separate the elements into individuals, and so they are treated here as a single group. The remains comprise the following bones: skull and mandibular fragments, two ribs; scapula (2 left); humérus (2 right); radius (2 left, 1 right); metacarpal (1 unsided); two small pelvic fragments; tibia (2 left, 2 right); calcaneus (1 right); astragalus (1 left); metatarsal III (1 right, 1 left, 2 unsided); lateral metapodial (1 unsided); metapodials (3 small fragments, unsided); proximal phalange (3 unsided) and some small unidentifiable limb bone fragments. The age at death was deduced from the state of the epiphyseal fusion of the limb bones. Not all the epiphyses were preserved. Of those that were, all were fused. Both right tibiae have the distal epiphyses fused, giving an age of at least two years for both horses and one individual is at least 3-3.5 years old, from the fusion of the proximal epiphysis. The following measurements were taken on the more complete limb bones. Table 33.

WALL-CROWTHER The similarity in size of the metatarsals to those from Tomb 79 (see below) may be noted. However, the proximal phalange for which a length could be measured is rather smaller than the fore phalanges of the Tomb 79 horses. The only complete limb bone gives an estimated withers height of 133.25 cm. The dentition (FIG. 195 0, b) suggests that the animal was a horse rather than a donkey, similar in size to those from Tomb 79. A few very fragmentary dog bones were also recovered, in an extremely poor state of preservation, comprising left mandible (with permanent Pi and P2); some loose teeth (canine, carnassial); radius and ulna (small fragments), 5 indeterminate shaft fragments (probably humérus and/or femur); 3 metapodials; 1 rib. Although the dog remains are very fragmentary, the shaft fragments of radius indicate probably two individuals. The condition of the bones precluded any measurements being taken. However, a visual comparison of the fragmentary limb bones with the corresponding dog bones from Tomb 79, skeletons I and II (see below), suggests an animal which was probably of a similar stature to these dogs. Although remains are very fragmentary and sparse, there is enough information to suggest that they represent a very similar burial to that found in the more completely preserved Tomb 79 (see below). We can suggest that these remains represent the burial of two horses and two dogs in this pit or tomb. One pig canine was also recovered. Tomb O (animal bone under pot 6): Cattle tooth (right upper third molar). Tomb (¿(bones from sieving side chamber): Pig: 1 tibia. Sheep-sized animal: 1 limb bone fragment. Indeterminate fragments: 3. Tomb 14 Equid scapula (probably horse). Animal tooth (probably cattle, but poorly preserved). Tomb 30 Sheep/goat tooth (lower molar). Sheep/goat: proximal phalanx. Tomb 34 Sheep/goat astragalus. Sheep/goat tibia (burnt). Tomb 75 Cattle tooth (lower premolar). Sheep/goat metacarpal. Sheep/goat humérus. Tomb 79 The lower burial level of Tomb 79 contained only animal bones - the skeletal remains of two equids and two dogs. The skeletons of the two equids and one of the dogs were fairly complete, but little of the second dog had survived (FIG. 31: Plans 2-4). EXCAVATION AND PRESERVATION The animal bones were recognized as articulated skeletons during excavation of the tomb, and were planned in situ by D. Smyth. They were removed, packed individually and labelled according to their numbers on the plans. This facilitated later study, and made possible the descriptions of the positions of the dog skeletons (see below), even though the latter were not recognized as such at the time of excavation. POST-EXCAVATION TREATMENT AND STORAGE It was recognized that this collection of articulated bones was an unusual find, and, consequently, some considerable care was expended on their preservation and conservation. This process, although time consuming, has resulted in the stabilization of the bone collection for future reference and study. The condition of the bones was poor, being friable, with much surface erosion. For this reason, they were not washed with water, but cleaned by gentle brushing with a camel hair</page><page sequence="415">THE ANIMAL BONES 705 brush, and using metal dental tools to remove harder deposits and concretions where necessary. When the bones were considered clean, they were treated with a solution of polyvinyl acetate, and breaks were mended with glue. The bones are now stored in shallow wooden boxes in the Stratigraphical Museum. POSITION OF ANIMALS IN THE TOMB EQUIDS 'East9 Horse (plate 3 1 5 a) This is the more completely preserved of the two equids. It was lying with its head towards the east, on its left side, with its front legs bent at elbow and knee, with its feet pointing towards the west. The front legs cross over the back legs, which are again folded beneath the animal, at stifle and hock, with the feet pointing towards the east. West9 Horse This horse was lying with its head towards the west, also on its left side, but with its head bent back towards the tail, so that the head is lying on its right side. DOGS 'Skeleton I' (plate 316) This is the better preserved. It was lying beneath the two horse skeletons, with its feet and body oriented in the opposite direction. Its head points towards the east, and its feet towards the north. Its limbs are more extended that those of the horses. It is lying on its right side. Its two front legs lie close together, and are bent but slightly at the elbow. Similarly, its back legs lie close together, bent slightly at the knee. 'Skeleton IP This skeleton is less well preserved than skeleton I. It is more difficult to judge what its original position would have been. It too is beneath the horse skeletons - either alongside, or possibly beneath skeleton I. The head was not found, but the remaining parts of the four limbs point in the same direction, that is, in the opposite direction to those of skeleton I, to the south. Some of its limb bones had been displaced, but all four paws were found very close together. This may suggest that the animal's position in the tomb was lying on its back, with its forelegs uppermost, pointing towards the tail and partly on top of its back legs. Its legs may possibly have been bound together before placing the animal in the tomb. PARTS OF SKELETON PRESERVED EQUID SKELETONS 'East Horse9 (FIG. 1 95 g, h; PLATE 3 1 5 a) The parts of the skeleton preserved are: skull, and part of left and right mandibles, ribs, left humérus (extremities not preserved), radius (extremities not preserved), ulna (very fragmentary), metacarpal (fairly complete), scaphoid, magnum, proximal phalange (fairly complete). Right radius (fairly complete, distal epiphysis missing), metacarpal (fairly complete). Left femur (part of distal epiphysis only), tibia (fairly complete, epiphyses missing), calcaneus (incomplete), astragalus (incomplete), tarsal bones (fragmentary), metatarsal (fairly complete), splint bone, proximal phalange (fairly complete).</page><page sequence="416">7o6 S. WALL-CROWTHER West Hme' (FIG. 195 e, f) The parts of the skeleton preserved are: skull not preserved, but some of left and right upper cheek teeth present, ribs. Right fore limb: radius (fairly complete shaft, distal epiphysis missing), metacarpal (almost entire bone), proximal phalange. Left fore-limb: humérus (distal end only), radius (almost complete), ulna (small fragment), metacarpal (fairly complete), proximal and medial phalanges. TEETH A close examination of the upper and lower teeth preserved from both equid skeletons was made in order to deduce: firstly, the age of the animals at death and, secondly, to aid in the specific identification of the animals within the genus Equus. AGE AT DEATH East Horse: Right and left maxillae and mandibular fragments with teeth were examined, and the surfaces of the teeth drawn (FIG. 195 e,fi. Of the upper teeth, the deciduous P2, P3 and P4 were in wear and likewise all the deciduous incisors, giving an estimated age at death of under 2.5 years, using criteria in Silver and Cornwall. Of the lower teeth, Mi was in wear, which (from Silver) gives an age of not more than 2.5 years old, and probably about 2 years. West Horse: The fairly complete upper and lower teeth were examined and drawn (FIG. 195). Of the upper teeth (left and right), dP2, dP3 and dP4 and permanent Mi were in wear. Permanent M2 was about to come into wear and M3 was not yet apparent. Of the lower teeth (left and right), the deciduous premolars 2, 3 and 4 and permanent Mi were in wear. Permanent M2 was about to come into wear and M3 was not yet apparent. The age at death can also be estimated from the state of epiphyseal fusion of the limb bones (using data from Silver). This gives ages for both horses of greater than 20-24 months and less than 3 years, which correlates closely with the ages deduced from the teeth. IDENTIFICATION An examination of the wear patterns of the cheek teeth, and comparisons with published drawings of equid teeth suggest that the animals can be identified as Equus caballus (horse) and not donkey or mule. It was not possible to identify the animals as either male or female from the dentition, because they were too young for the permanent canine to have appeared (this tooth is normally only present in the male, and erupts at about 4 years). MEASUREMENTS Measurements are normally only carried out on adult skeletal remains for comparative purposes. Due to the immaturity of the skeletons, there were too few measurements which it was possible to take. However, as the metapodials fuse early, these were measured. It is possible that slight growth would have continued in these bones, but they can give us a rough idea of the stature of the animals. Measurements taken are those described by von den Driesch, and additional measurements described by Ducas.</page><page sequence="417">THE ANIMAL BONES 707 Table 34.

This implies that they were deliberately killed in order to be buried. The method of killing, however, cannot be deduced from the bone evidence. No marks were found on the bones to give a clue to the way they met their death. The condition of the bones (friable, and with much surface erosion), indeed, is such that one would not necessarily expect to see any marks of cuts or blows preserved, even if a blow had penetrated as far as the bone.

As explained above, the Herakleion Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities early in 1978 invited the School's immediate assistance in the urgent investigation of a large tract of land north of the Venizeleion Hospital prior to new construction there for the University of Crete. The year-long collaboration between the School, the Ephorate and the University was a memorable experience for the participants. The School remains deeply grateful for the support and understanding of its Greek colleagues in circumstances which were always stressful, sometimes intimidating. The wholly unexpected nature of the enterprise inevitably imposed heavy strains on the School's organisation both during the excavations and the subsequent lengthy periods of study. The residential amenities of the Knossos Taverna and the archaeological resources of the Stratigraphie Museum at Knossos provided the essential infrastructure without which the School's share of the work could not have been attempted. The presence at Knossos of the Fellow, Dr. Jill Carington-Smith, and the determination and skill with which she undertook the day-to-day direction in the field were invaluable, and the importance of her contribution cannot be exaggerated. The late Mr. David Smyth's work as Surveyor was a tour de force ', carried out in conditions always most difficult, often intolerable. The formidable subsequent task of study was immeasurably assisted by the great skill and devoted work of a matchless vase-mender, the late Mr. Petros Petrakis, Hon. MBE. Faced with what proved to be an unexpectedly large undertaking, the School responded with vigour to the Ephorate's invitation. In 1978 it gave the Knossian tombs priority over its fieldwork elsewhere. Even at Knossos itself, research plans of many individual members of the School were altered at short notice in response to requests made to them for the study and publication of different elements of the complex results. The immediate arrangements of other members, working at the School in 1978, were dislocated by their positive responses to requests for help with excavation supervision or workroom assistance. They have all earned the School's gratitude. I It is 62 years since Humfry Payne and Alan Blakeway excavated a series of post-Minoan tombs at Fortetsa, 38 years since their work was very thoroughly published by James Brock in F. Between the publication of F. and these KNC volumes, progress has been made in the study of the Greek Dark Ages, not excepting Crete. More generally, strides forward have been taken in the evaluation and presentation of evidence yielded by funerary sites, including greater use of other disciplines to enlarge the framework of information. This publication has in particular profited from the publication of work in the Argolis, at Lefkandi and Eretria in Euboea, and at sites in Cyprus. Where Brock had, perforce, to report on virtually all classes of</page><page sequence="422">7I2 THE EDITORS material unassisted, KNC has been able to draw on the knowledge of at least ten specialists in the purely archaeological material, another two for human and faunal remains, as well as the resources and expertise of the Fitch Laboratory at the School in Athens for a major programme of materials analysis for pottery finds. This comparison serves to emphasize our unqualified admiration for James Brock's achievement. Visitors to Fortetsa approaching the village uphill from the turn off the main road opposite the Venizeleion may, as they breast the incline, pause and look back towards the NE. Conspicuous in the middle distance (PLATE i b) is the spread of the low University buildings that overlie the heart of the N Cemetery. ENE can just be made out the modern buildings near Khaniale Teke that cover the positions of Tombs A-Q Excavation emptied these tombs of their contents; subsequent building operations completely destroyed the tombs themselves. Nothing now remains. The construction of the University of Crete's buildings on our site is but the latest in a long series of vicissitudes in its history. Our excavation suggests this was virtually a virgin site until the mid-eleventh century BC. From that date forward, for the next 400-500 years, activity there was continuous, chiefly comprising the repeated reuse of family chamber tombs for the interment of inurned cremations. The disarray in which many of the tombs were found is at least partly explained by that reuse which in some cases saw the relegation into the dromoi of earlier urns to make space in the chambers for later generations; in others, clusters of later urns consigned to pits dug in dromos fill. II Throughout our work on the N Cemetery we have been conscious of building on the foundations so impressively laid by James Brock in his publication of twenty-two chamber tombs in his Fortetsa volume, in 1957. Since then, reports of more recently dug chamber tombs of the Early Iron Age at Knossos have been piecemeal, until the publication of over a hundred tombs of the N Cemetery in these volumes. What new light has this massive corpus cast on the development of Knossos between the Subminoan and Orientalizing periods? Considerable advances on the Subminoan front receive comment in the next Section. For every phase, no doubt, the statistician will have much more material to count - although, let us admit, the incidence of undisturbed burials is proportionally rather less than in the Fortetsa publication. This is partly because of the much greater encroachment of Hellenistic and Roman burials, and partly - even within the Early Iron Age - due to the close congestion of tombs, often seriously damaging their recent predecessors;1602 a congestion never encountered in any previously explored plot of these periods. This unusually dense concentration, together with the great quantity of burials,1603 lends some weight to Humfry Payne's supposition in 1929, 1604 that the main cemetery of Knossos, throughout the Early Iron Age, lay well to the North of the settlement. His surmise was then based on slender evidence, confined to the rich tombs excavated by Hogarth, Evans and himself along the Kephala ridge (see the map ILL. 17), some 500 metres to the east of our main excavation. He already knew, however, of Geometric sherds found on a plot to the west of the 1602 E.g. the clusters centred around Ts. 34, 98, and 104/134. 1603 Estimated at between 422 and 671 (Teke and Medical Faculty): p. 660. lbU* BSA 29 (1927-2»), 231.</page><page sequence="423">EPILOGUE 713 &gt;aT 1 minoan i * /?

After excavating an outlying tomb to the west of Ayios Ioannis, S. Alexiou1606 argued that Knossos, during our periods, had no main cemetery; applying Aristotle's reconstruction (Pol. i252b.28) explaining how the Greek polis arose from a coalescence of villages, he supposed a village near every burial plot, and a burial plot near every village, before the emergence of the Knossian polis. Aristotle, however, was aware that the Cretans could have pursued a very different path towards the evolution of their city-states.1607 And, on the ground, no certain trace of outlying villages has ever been found in the Knossos area. It is, of course, unwise to argue from large tracts of ground far to the north, much of it now covered by the recent expansion of modern Herakleion. More telling, however, is the negative evidence within central Knossos, where no traces of any burial has ever come to light. On the contrary, finds of settlement pottery from Subminoan onwards, often buried deep under Roman remains, have been recovered over a central area some 500 metres square, to the west of the ruined Minoan palace.1608 It is this central nucleus, we would argue, that housed most of the people buried in the N Cemetery, carried to their graves in funeral processions hardly more than one kilometre, or twenty minutes' walk. Further to the north, the tombs of Ayios Ioannis, Atsalenio and Mastamba are too distant to have served the central settlement of Knossos: they may yet prove to be attached to small outlying hamlets, now covered under modern built-up areas in the southern outskirts of Herakleion. Nearer the centre, however, this explanation becomes less plausible for the main Fortetsa group and the Gypsades tombs, in areas fully explored and surveyed; a more likely possibility is that some Knossian families may have preferred to inter their dead on their own land, rather than in the large communal cemetery to the north.1609 How extensive, then, was this main N Cemetery? Its southern limit is probably formed by a scatter of tombs between the Venizeleion hospital and the fork of the road leading towards Fortetsa village; this scatter includes the F/67 group presented here and, presumably, tombs L, TFT and Pi published by Brock in Fortetsa, of which the precise locations have been lost.1610 There are also several outlying tombs (KS2 nos. 49-51) extending up to 200 metres west of the main road. Expansion to the north went well past our main Teke group, to the plot around the Teke tholos (KS2 no. 46) and even beyond, to judge from the report of a rich but as yet unpublished tomb exposed in the foundation for a new hotel.1611 To the east it is not inconceivable that the cemetery may have extended as far as the Kephala ridge (KS2 nos. 16, 39), source of the vases published by Payne. The intervening ground has not yet been much explored, but we know already of the 'Geometrical Tombs' west of the Kairatos river mentioned by Evans (KS2 no. 41), and more early tombs have recently come to light in the neighbourhood of the new University's restaurant some 200 metres east of the main Teke group.1612 The Medical Faculty plot, then, constitutes only a small portion of an enormous cemetery; but, geographically, it is a central portion, which may well prove to contain the kernel from which the cemetery later spread outwards on all four points of the compass. i605F. 1, fig. 2. 1606 KCh 4 (1950), 296 ff; cf.

Use of the cemetery begins in the mid-eleventh century BC and can, indeed, be taken as a marker for the beginning of the SM period. Though SM graves have been reported elsewhere in the Knossos area, the N Cemetery contains far the largest concentration. This opening of a new necropolis suggests a break with the past; so does the introduction of the rite of cremation. Though the point could never be resolved, the peripheral distribution of other SM burials at e.g. Ayios Ioannis and Gypsades, might imply a dichotomy in the population of Knossos, with survivors from the Minoan past confined to outlying burial grounds, while new masters were concentrated in a conspicuous new cemetery much closer to the main settlement. The use of three quite distinct types of grave, the coexistence of the rites of inhumation and cremation and the deposition of very different levels of grave offering alike suggest a society made up of different strains, one that had inherited elements from the fairly recent past (all three types of grave, rite of inhumation) with much that was new (small scale of shaft graves and pit caves, rite of cremation, exotic metal types, new version of the miles gloriosus). The richly furnished Ts. 186, 200-201, perhaps the earliest in the cemetery, have an oikistic flavour; their locations could explain the extraordinary congestion of later graves in the neighbouring area. P. M. Warren's comment1613 on the contrast between the location of SM Knossos and the location of SM Karphi was well made, and is fully endorsed, it seems, by the N Cemetery. It seems there may have been painful divisions in the SM population of Crete, divisions which would only be healed centuries later. The SM groups in Ts. 186, 200-201 are not only the richest at present known from Knossos; they must be richer than any contemporary burials not only in SM Crete but in SMyc Greece as well. Their undisturbed condition greatly enhances their importance by providing unequivocal contexts for a wide range of objects of great interest, war-gear being chief among them. The heroic flavour (in Homeric terms) is strong, and nowhere stronger than in the remains of boars' tusks in T 201 offering a wonderful illustration of the survival by heirloom transmission of an antique helmet that recalls what is, perhaps, archaeologically the most famous passage in the Iliad. Other items (the bronze stand, pieces of jewellery, whetstones) suggest links with Cyprus that harmonise with earlier theories (notably those of V R. d'A. Desborough)1614 concerning relations between the two islands at the turn of the Bronze and Iron Ages. The male occupants of Ts. 186, 200-201 may fairly be called 'grandees',1615 evidence of a hierarchical society, no doubt, and viewed from the same standpoint as the grandees of Kaloriziki T. 40, Tiryns T. XXVIII and Lefkandi, Toumba, with whom they have much in common. IV If the SM grandees had some links with Cyprus in their metallic goods, there are many signs of contact with other Aegean centres from the tenth century onwards in the form of imports, mainly of pottery. The extreme rarity of any corresponding exports - and none before the eighth century1616 - makes it seem unlikely that the EIA Knossians took an active role in 1613 AR 2Q (iq8s), 8*, and see The Ages of Homer, 128. 1614 GDA 49-63. 1615 Rather than the pejorative term 'elite'. 1616 GGP382, nn. 1-7; J. N. Coldstream and G. L. Huxley, Kythera: Excavations and Studies (London, 1972), 306.</page><page sequence="426">7j6 the editors overseas trade, in contrast to the more energetic Euboeans. Even so, the wide variety of pottery imports does at least establish Knossos as an exceptionally outward-looking place with a frequently visited port of call,1617 and always ready to profit from commercial exchange with visitors from many directions. The range of the imports is wider than in F.: thus we have specimens of Corinthian, Thessalian, and Euboean LPG, Euboean SubPG and LG, Cycladic EG, MG and LG, East Greek SubPG and perhaps LG, and Argive LG. Far more plentiful, however, are the Attic imports: more than a hundred vessels forming an unbroken sequence from LPG to LG, and constituting as much as 3% of our total ceramic corpus. Only one other Aegean region received such a generous quantity of fine Attic PG and G pottery: Euboea. If one enquires into the possibility of a special relationship between Knossos and Athens, the case of Euboea - and Lefkandi in particular - provides a useful parallel case for comparison.1618 In addition to the unusually high proportion of Attic pottery, common to both Knossos and Lefkandi is the continuity in the Attic sequence there,1619 and also the presence of Attic shapes very rarely exported elsewhere. To be sure, as in other Greek regions, the imports are especially frequent (in Attic terms) during LPG and MG, and in both places, in both periods, their impact on the local style was considerable. During the EG interval, however, Attic imports persist at Knossos and Lefkandi as nowhere else in Greece. At Knossos, surprisingly, these EG imports are confined to large and floridly decorated belly-handled amphorae, supplemented by a few contemporary Cycladic imitations. In ninth-century Athens the only function of this impressive shape was to house the ashes of high-ranking women.1620 If any of the fourteen Attic amphorae, spread over the two centuries between LPG and MG II, had served a similar purpose at Knossos, one might envisage the possibility of Athenian women sometimes marrying into Knossian families; such an interpretation could also be placed upon the presence of PG clay beads with incised decoration, a simple article of personal adornment which only Knossos shares with Athens.1621 And yet, although the amphorae, both imported and local, have been included as possible urns for statistical purposes,1622 none has ever been found to contain ashes.1623 At Knossos, then, we lack any compelling indication of family ties with Athens, such as we find at Lefkandi in the occasional hole-in-trench PG cremation of Athenian type.1624 Alternatively, the more spectacular Attic imports might at least betoken special links between leading Knossian and Athenian families manifested in gift exchange, the amphorae perhaps serving as wine containers at the funeral parties.1625 This hypothesis might seem especially attractive when large and imposing Attic vessels are spread over several generations 1617 AD 23 (1968), B 429: ninth-century pottery found on the sea front of Herakleion. 1618 See, in greater detail, J. N. Coldstream, 'Knossos and Lefkandi: the Attic connections' in D. Evely, I. Lemos, S. Sherratt (Ed.), Minotaur and Centaur: Studies...... presented to M. R. Popham (Oxford, 1996), 133-45. 1619 At Lefkandi, from the Toumba deposit {Lefkandi II. 1, 134-5, MPG) until the end of the cemeteries (Lefkandi I, 350-4, MG I). 162o E.g. Kerameikos Vi, grave 41; Hesperia 37 (1968), 77 ff. 1621 D. Evely, eh. 16, p. 627. The case for a personal connection with Athens is especially plausible in the E-MPG tomb J, where a large collection of these beads keeps company with 28 imported Attic pots, almost half the total corpus in that tomb. 1622 w. G. Cavanagh, ch. 18, p. 661. 1623 'Ye cannot, of course, exclude this possibility, almost all the Attic amphorae having been retrieved from scattered fragments. There is, however, some negative evidence from the two most complete examples: G 3, the only large vessel on an undisturbed chamber floor which did not contain ashes (Platon, pp. 12-13); and 207.52, from a tomb in which the only human bones were unburnt (p. 196). 1624 E.g.

Thus, for the wide range, high quality and profusion of the Attic vessels a simpler explanation emerges. They take their place beside imports from many other directions as luxury items enjoyed per se, as indicators of high social status; the more prosperous families of Knossos would naturally look towards the outside world, and thence derive much of their prosperity. In this respect Lefkandi offers a comparable case. Attic pottery there was evidently prized as a form of wealth, often being found in the same rich graves as eastern faience and bronze vessels, and ornaments of gold.1628 V Familiarity with the layout of KNC, particularly the central part dug in 1978-79, stimulates the wish to understand its topography, as well as to describe it, and to visualise features long ago vanished whose existence could explain aspects of the site we now find very puzzling. The topography of KNC is a mixture of order, and apparent chaos. There is on the one hand the relatively orderly arrangement of similarly aligned chamber tombs placed close together in groups of four or more (well seen in Teke 1975-76, FIG. 2; KMF North, FIG. 3, KMF West, FIG. 4, and a little less distinctly, in the three groups of KMF South-West, FIG. 5). Between these groups, tomb orientation varies between NW-SE, and W-E, the chambers always to the E. We might suppose these clusters reflected Knossian kinship groups, of whatever description, and in whatever way. We may suppose that the location not only of each group, but of each grave within each group was somehow clearly marked during their centuries of use. Within these groups, encroachment of one grave upon another was virtually unknown - an exception is the Ts. 44-48-60-61 group, where T. 60 was slighted by T. 138 dug at right angles to it into its dromos. There could well have been ephemeral enclosures surrounding the discrete groups, and there might have been a network of access-paths whose arrangement was facilitated by the systematic layout ofthat part of the site covered by FIGS. 2-5 (part). On the other hand, the south and south-east sectors (FIG. 5, part; 6) are chaotic, giving the impression of a different set of rules for cemetery use. There was no common orientation (see in particular FIG. 6) - some chamber tombs lie S-N (T. 28), others N-S (T. 18), with much variety between these extremes. There was great congestion, so that in some cases later tombs encroached upon earlier, as with the Ts. 98, 106, 152, 163, 168 complex (FIG. 5), Ts. 104 and 134 (FIG. 6). Many of the earliest, SM, tombs belong here, and perhaps the lack of system belongs to the very beginnings of the site, and could be explained in one, or all, of three ways - variety of tomb types, simultaneous practice of cremation and inhumation, desire to be as close as possible to a prestigious grave. '626 E.g. 285.129 (LPG amphora), 154 (EG I amphora), 153 (MG II krater). In that tomb it is reassuring to know that, among the cremated remains within urns of three different centuries, the reoccurrence of a rare and congenital deformation of the mandible (J. H. Musgrave, ch. 19, p. 681) confirms the common-sense view that collective tombs in continuous use are reserved for individual kin groups. 1627 MC* II set: 33 (vast amphora), 42 (krater), 23 (pyxis); other amphorae, 89-90 (LPG), 91 (EG I). 1628 T. 31, T. 33 (Leßandi I, pls. 185-8); T. 39 (BSA 77 (1982), pls. 17-20); T. 47, T. 55 (AR 35 (1989), 118 ff.); T. 70 (OJA 14 (1995), 103 ff.); T. 80 (OJA 14 (1995), 151 ff.).</page><page sequence="428">7I8 THE EDITORS The puzzle posed by the contrast between well-spaced, orderly arrangement in the north part, and higgeldy-piggeldy location of tombs in the south is compounded by the presence already in the SM period of chamber tombs belonging to embryonic orderly arrangements. In FIG. 5, T. 207 in one of the ranks, Ts. 24, 45 and 46 in another, make this point. Indeed, although a large majority of the SM tombs was concentrated in the more chaotic part of the site, there are one or two outliers up to 100 metres both north and south of the main concentration. Our difficulties in understanding the contradictory elements in KNC's topography are increased by our almost complete uncertainty concerning the physical appearance of the area during its successive stages of development. If this were not so, we might better understand why the very large area, roughly some 6000 m2 in extent, later occupied by the mortuary church and its ancillary structures, contains only three Dark Age graves; and the enclosure wall just clips three others when the area of 3750 m2 just beyond the south-west angle of the Early Christian enclosure contains some 60 graves. We seek an explanation, but only guesses come - perhaps the ground where the church later stood was bad for digging tombs; perhaps the area contained a venerated feature: was there a problem of land ownership? Because this question is unanswerable, so, too, are such problems as why the cemetery spread so far north on a narrow front when it might seem (to us) better sense to have used much more of the east-west dimension of the area. We can be sure, though, that the reasons for the arrangement of KNC being as we found it were complex, and probably not the same at all periods of its history. VI The second half of the ninth century is a period of great interest and importance in the story of the N Cemetery - and, indeed, of Knossos generally. Then it was that urn cremation became fully established as the normal rite; then, too, the numbers of interments show a sharp rise (p. 660, ILL. 10) consistent with a rapid growth of population, such as in other Greek regions has not been observed before the eighth century. Also worthy of note is a considerable shift in the use of the chamber tombs. Some thirty were in use during the main PG sequence; but, at the turn to PGB in the mid-ninth century, only eight of these continued to receive interments.1629 Then, within the later ninth century, sixteen more - including some of the richest - came into use. A similar 'caesura' has been noted among the Fortetsa tombs, as well as in the abandonment of the Ayios Ioannis plot.1630 Are there any causal connections between these three developments? The final conversion to cremation could be put down to a desire to save burial space for a rapidly rising population. After the 'caesura', some of the new tombs (e.g. M, 13, 104, 147, 286) seem purpose-built for cremations, in the modest size of their chambers. They are modest, too, in their contents. Others, paradoxically, flaunt chambers surprisingly large for the stacking of urns (e.g. G, N, 75, 107, 283), recalling the capacious sepulchres of LM III that had been designed for inhumations. These are among the richest tombs in the cemetery, and the families who inaugurated their use clearly had some confidence in a settled future. 1629 Ts. D, O, Q,, 100, 175, 219, 285, 287. (In a separate category are SM-PG tombs reused after a long gap: Table 8.) i630GG48n.59.</page><page sequence="429">EPILOGUE 7jg The paradox of these spacious tombs, in an age of cremation, could be resolved if we admit the possibility of a fourth important new development, at least among the leading families: a growth of interest and pride in the Minoan - or, to them, the 'heroic' past. Another obvious sign of involvement with a bygone age is the occurrence in the N Cemetery of sixteen LM III clay larnakes, found in contexts which, when known, are never earlier than PGB. We cannot know for certain how many of them were reused for later interments:1631 all are fragmentary, often retrieved from widely scattered pieces - but so also were many of the PGB and EG urns which must have housed the early incumbents in the new rich tombs, shunted and damaged by several subsequent generations and - usually - scattered by later robbers. The presence of the larnakes shows that the reopening of LM III tombs in the Dark Age, whether accidental or intentional, was not an unusual event. Did any of the larnakes originally belong to the tombs in which they were found, LM III tombs reused in the Early Iron Age? Vigorous arguments to the contrary are advanced here1632 and, indeed, the correlation of find-spots between larnakes and Minoan-type tombs is very slender. In a cluster analysis of many variables in the details of tomb construction, only six of our tombs1633 qualify as conforming to the high standards of LM III, notably in the careful shaping of their stomia. Even for these, however, it remains possible that some, at least, were skilful and respectful pastiches of the Dark Age - informed, no doubt, by a view of real LM III tombs from which the larnakes were extracted. Among the tombs of LM III type is T. 1 06 with its large squared chamber, its well-shaped stomion and its long dromos: it must be just such a pastiche, since it encroaches upon two earlier Dark Age tombs, 98 and 168. On the other hand the Teke tholos, with its stone Horns of Consecration and its blocks dressed in the Minoan manner,1634 is not so easily dismissed as an imitation of the Dark Age, although even this is not impossible. If any of our tombs is originally of Minoan construction, the most promising candidate is T. 75, a rich tomb receiving its first cremations in the late ninth century, situated in an area untouched by earlier Dark Age tombs, conforming in every detail to the requisites of Minoan construction, and containing the remains of two larnakes. One of them is the fine but battered figured piece whose fragments were scattered widely between T. 75 and its equally rich neighbour, T. 107 (107.214). This larnax introduces us to a more tangible instance of Minoan inspiration for the Knossians of the later ninth century. The form itself was reproduced on a modest scale (104. 118),1635 just large enough to contain the inhumation of a child. Many elements in the decoration of 107.214 - goddess of vegetation, spiral tree, alighting bird - are rendered in a geometricized form on a PGB straight-sided pithos, 107.114, which had evidently housed one of the first cremations in the tomb where most pieces of the larnax were found.1636 The linear ornament of other such pithoi admits a freehand curvilinear repertoire, unique in Greece at this time, in which neo-Minoan elements are fused with motifs from Near Eastern portable art. Furthermore, the straight-sided shape itself is clearly an enlarged revival of a LM III C 'pyxis', the receptacle for the earliest cremations in Crete (p. 314). 1631 Those most likely to have been so re-used are Q, 116 (PGB), 31.11 (LG), 113.1 (LG?), 294.63 (M-LG) and 294.6 (O). 1632 HWC, ch. 17, p. 639.

Metal, however, provides a more continuous index of the relative affluence of the families using our tombs.1637 We miss, alas, the high quality of evidence from the cemeteries of Lefkandi, where unplundered single graves contained intact gold. Nevertheless, the careful and patient study of bronze and iron - the latter having little appeal for plunderers - allows a tentative ranking, with T 219 at its apex, and Ts. 107, 283 and 285 not far below; T. 283, pillaged with unusual thoroughness, nevertheless preserves a vast quantity of fragmentary iron. Common to all these tombs is the abundance of warriors' gear. Warriors, as in the cemetery's SM origins, are prominent among the rich tombs where, especially in the seventh century, they may also be furnished with their Homeric feasting equipment of iron spits and firedogs. Some of our later incumbents, then, may be admitted to the ranks of 'the four samurai of the Mediterranean world'1638 - the four warrior burials with spits and firedogs in the tholos tomb at Kavousi, in Argos grave 45, and in Cyprus at Kouklia and in Salamis T. 79. One wonders, however, whether there is any convincing evidence for social hierarchy within the N Cemetery community. This is not the same as ranking individual tombs according to the relative wealth of their contents, an exercise attempted supra, on the strengths of iron and bronze grave offerings as indicators. From the start, the special circumstances of the cemetery, both during use, and subsequently, militate against an objective demonstration of such an hierarchy. Multiple use of chamber tombs for interring inurned cremations is unhelpful. So is the disturbed state in which all tombs were found (even archaeologically undisturbed tombs such as 285 had been substantially rearranged during use). Always excepting the Khaniale Teke tholos on the very fringe of the cemetery, there is no sign of 'royal' burial, on, for instance, the analogy of Salamis, Kition, Tamassos and Paphos in Cyprus. There is no type of grave, and no method of disposal of the dead which sets one interment apart from another. With very few exceptions, the types of offering essentially repeat themselves - almost monotonously. Cemetery topography hardly favours a hierarchical arrangement of the grave with respect to one another. Within such heavily used graves as T. 75 or T. 285 we look in vain for any urn treated with particular respect. The overwhelming impression of the N Cemetery's Dark Age population is of individuals who had much in common, not least their status, not all of whom were either able or willing to advertise their success in life by the same degree of consumption in death as some of their peers. So many of them seem to have been equipped as fighting men that this feature was probably one of the marks of their class. Another mark that they were substantially all of the same status may have been the very fact that they were eligible for the expense of a cremation-funeral, and for the interment of their ashes within a family or kinship grave in this particular cemetery. One sign of class distinction, however, might have been the owning of horses. Horse-burial is a special feature of the N Cemetery, echoed by the deposition in T. 219 of bronze horse-bits. Though the complex of T. 79, where two horses and two dogs were carefully interred, was the most circumstantial, a similar horse-grave was found adjacent to T. F and a third, poorly i637Cf.Snodgrass,/X4G286. 1638 Boardman, KCh 23 (1971), 8.</page><page sequence="431">EPILOGUE 72i preserved, is very probable in T. 163. While the occurrence of pairs of horses could suggest chariotry, there is no other supporting evidence that these had been driven horses; the presence of dogs is more in favour of hunting.1639 There must be significance in the pairs of animals - one is reminded of such vase-paintings as on the Pontic amphora Oxford 1961.46g,1640 much later, of course, than our burials. Whatever the explanation, horse and hound belong to a world of grandees: so, too, does the slaughter of healthy two-year-olds out of respect for the memory of their owners. Such profligacy is seen on an even grander scale in the Prinias cemetery where, between 1972 and 1976, our Italian colleagues found eighteen animal burials.1641 Could it be that horse-ownership set you apart? Or was it horse-slaughter that did that? VIII Near Eastern luxuries in faience and ivory, as already noted, provide another adornment among the goods in the richer tombs. Since the days of the SM warriors, the Knossians had never wholly lost their eastern contacts: witness the Levantine bronze bowl with the Phoenician inscription J.fi) and the bronze cauldrons with lotus handles; also the local PG versions of exotic Gypriot vase forms like the lentoid flask, the zoomorphic askos, and the ring kernos with miniature vessels - again found mainly in the richer tombs (G, Q, 75, 107, 219, 285). Later on, an eastern amenity more widely spread among our tombs is the import of unguent vessels, moving in the reverse direction from Aegean stirrup jars exported eastward in the Late Bronze Age. Crete, alone among Aegean regions, preserves a truly continuous sequence of unguent shapes all through its Dark Age, a sequence which has been abundantly filled out by the N Cemetery finds; though rarely found in settlement contexts, their frequent occurrence in tombs could be explained by the need to anoint the dead before the funeral rite.1642 At first the ancestral stirrup jar perseveres all through our main PG sequence, later even than in the ultra- conservative land of Cyprus. In LPG it is replaced temporarily by the open-necked stirrup jar, which soon gives place to a large lekythos of similar proportions. From PGB onwards the lekythoi are greatly reduced in size, perhaps to bottle a more concentrated substance acquired through eastern imports. These at first consist of a few slow-pouring vessels coming from the Phoenician homeland in the late ninth century, followed in the eighth by a steady flow of the more accomplished juglets of Cypriot BoR with the neck ridge. They have an immediate effect on the local lekythoi. Early Cretan copies are close enough to suggest the establishment of a Knossian factory staffed by Cypro-Phoenician entrepreneurs;1643 but from LG onwards the Creto-Cypriot adaptations attain a slick elegance unmatched by the Cypriot originals. Some unguents also came from Corinth though, unusually, very rarely after MG; imported Corinthian MG aryballoi, both painted and monochrome, also influenced the local potters. By the seventh century, when Corinthian aryballoi were circulating over the entire Mediterranean, the Knossians had virtually no need of them; the fertile invention of their own potters, stimulated by earlier Cypriot and Corinthian models and further nurtured by local fantasy, had engendered a robust autarky in the manufacture of unguent containers. 1639 Cf. J. K. Anderson, Hunting in the Ancient World (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1984). In T.

Thereafter the site was never again used regularly as a cemetery until Hellenistic times. Our finds do not help to unravel the mystery why all the EIA tombs should have come to such an abrupt full stop, and we feel no great urge to add to the various speculations already advanced.1644 Suffice it to say that, during the course of the seventh century, there does seem to have been a diminution of the number of tombs in use, and in the number of interments;1645 but there is certainly no falling-off in the quality of the goods offered in the richer tombs - indeed, the final LO use of the tombs is effectively dated by the superb East Greek and Corinthian imports. Thus, if the abandonment of the cemeteries were due to any sort of catastrophe in war, that catastrophe would have come suddenly at a time when Knossos was not suffering any decline in prosperity. Might it be not so much a reverse for the whole polis of Knossos that caused the abandonment of the cemetery, as a major political change which led to the disappearance of the Knossian grandees? Perhaps relevant to the question of the nature of events in the N Cemetery during the long hiatus in its use may be the presence over much of the site of fragments of coarse Archaic pithoi. None was found within any tomb or grave, or associated with any bones; and none was in a state anywhere near approaching completeness. They have the look of being not in situ, but dumped from elsewhere. Such vessels are more appropriate in a domestic1646 than in a funerary context. It may be that, by the Archaic period, our site was no longer used as a cemetery, but had become absorbed within the northward expansion of a growing polis. We must acknowledge, however, that the sixth century still remains a true 'Dark Age' for Knossos, with very little indeed to show in its archaeological record. So, it seems that from the Archaic period until developed Hellenistic times the cemetery site remained disused. Burial was then resumed, and continued on a large scale, so that the site became honeycombed with single inhumations, Hellenistic and Roman, some of which were cut into dromoi (e.g. T. 75) or chambers (e.g. T. 104) of older tombs. Many of these late graves were neatly arranged in groups (cf. SITE PLAN; PLATE 2 c-d), suggesting funeral enclosures. They very rarely encroached upon one another; markers for individual graves seem likely. This reuse of an old necropolis must have been deliberate. The cemetery plan even suggests that the precise areas of the old graves may have been well known (cf. e.g. PLATE 3 c) and sought after for burial. The same behaviour was observed at Fortetsa, and seems to have extended as far N as Khaniale Teke. How strange the contrast for the burial parties between the clean kouskouras upcast from such graves as 128, 130, 131, 133 dug in a virgin patch, and the heap of dark soil littered with broken pottery and laced with cremated bone at the graves they had dug into the old Ts. 75 or 104 (PLATE 3 b, d). Large built tombs appeared in the cemetery in Roman times (SITE PLAN, Ts. 33, 239), including at least one magnificent monumental mausoleum built 'perhaps early in the reign of Antoninus Pius5,1647 elements of 1644 Brock, F. 219 n. 2; Dunbabin, Gnomon (1952), 195 fif; Boardman, CCO 148; Hood, AS* 18-19; Coldstream, Dorian Knossos 321, Urban Nucleus, 297-9, Urns w^1 ^^ I2I&gt; Huxley, in Knossos, a Labyrinth of History: papers in honour ofS.

This complex appears to have been located as far as possible to avoid the old pagan graves - could the markers suggested for the Hellenistic and Roman inhumations still have been visible, and were they, therefore, respected by the Christian community? The church and its ossuaries were the final elements in a discontinuous 1500-year history of the area's use as the major cemetery of Knossos. As may be imagined, some further damage was caused to the pagan graves by the construction of the church and its enclosure wall (e.g. T. 48 - see PLATE 19a), compounded centuries later when what remained of the site's structures was almost entirely quarried away (probably under the direction of the occupants of Houses A and B-SITE PLAN) to provide the Venetian garrison of Cândia with material to strengthen its defences against the Ottoman Turks. So far as concerns the archaeology of the Knossos region, it is unlikely that there will ever again occur the opportunity for the rapid investigation of so large an area of the ancient site, or the opportunity for seeing the ancient features of so large an area as a whole.
