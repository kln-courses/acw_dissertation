<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREAS HAARDER, Beowulf: The Appeal of a Poem. Viborg: Akademisk Forlag, 1975. Pp. 341. HAARDER'S study of Beowuif is an essential volume for every specialist and serious student. It is not really intended for beginners, although all Old English passages are translated "to guide the reader with little or no familiarity with the language" (pp. 9-10). Such a reader could indeed profit from the overall interpretation of the poem worked out in chapter nine.

Significantly, Danish quotations are translated throughout, and herein lies one of the major contributions of the work - perhaps the most helpful service Haarder could have performed. He is no doubt correct in suspecting that not all Old English specialists are likely to be at home in Danish, which means that many students of Beowulf will meet here for the first time such major contributions in the field as those of Grundtvig; and they will find incipient therein views and controversies which are still with us. To say that the first eight chapters of a ten-chapter book constitute a review of Beowulf studies from Thorkelin to the present may make the work sound like a revised dissertation of an all-too-familiar sort, which it is not. Throughout, Haarder is not only analyzing an extraordinary range of materials and putting them in a new perspective, including the various critics' (and editors' and adaptors') evaluations of each others' work; he is also developing a truly synthetic work of scholarship and criticism. He subsumes and makes use of every significant contribution and approach to date (understandably hitting only high points in the literature of the last few decades), denying few schools of thought, if any, their worth, while avoiding em- broilment in such knotty controversies as the nature of the formula and the role of Unferth. The uniting thread which runs through the book is, as the subtitle indicates, the appeal of the poem: Beowulf, we are shown, has appealed to different readers for astoundingly different reasons, but the poem's appeal as poem has always been the basic reason why it attracted attention, and, Haarder would have us see, it is now time to reappraise its poetic effects, making use of what we have learned from a variety of tangential, and not-so-tangential, approaches. Chapters on Tolkien (7, "A Work of Art") and the oral-formulaic theory (8, "The Anglo-Saxon Scop") lead directly into the author's own reading. Tolkien, he suggests, took what might be termed an anthropomorphic view of the poet, creating a scop in Tolkien's own image: a Christian scholar who produced a carefully planned written work using "ancient and largely traditional material" for a fresh purpose (pp. 168- 169) and thus closely resembling the author of The Lord of the Rings. But, in light of the work of Magoun et al., Haarder concludes that the only reasonable way to understand the purposes of the scop is to see him in the setting he himself describes, and in which he describes the scop as having his existence and audience: the hall. While the resulting overall interpretation is, in many ways, close to, though hardly identical with, (among others) that of Edward B. Irving, Jr., whose work is discussed at some length in an appendix, its individual, and original, strength stems from Haarder's insistence on starting with what this and other works of the period tell us of the "hall" and its culture, and the poet's role in that culture. Thus his argument that the poem's world is basically a tension between hall and non-hall is profoundly different from such other hall-oriented interpretations as that of Alvin A. Lee, yet can be seen as being harmonious with the orientation of The Guest-Hall of Eden, too. For example, Haarder's comment on "Wyrd oft nereb unfaegne eorl, bonne his ellen deah" - "That is to say, through action man will confirm his own life" (p. 239) - states a fundamental Christian view, intimately related to the doctrine of the Incarna- tion. In short, while it would be surprising if most readers did not find something dubious, unsettling, or downright offensive here, it would be equally surprising if they did not also find much that is stimulating and illuminating.
