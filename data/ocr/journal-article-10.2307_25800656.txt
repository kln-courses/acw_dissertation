<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 8, No. 4, 1994 The Prehistory of Cyprus: Problems and Prospects A. Bernard Knapp1 [with Steve O. Held2 and Sturt W. Manning3] The archaeological record of prehistoric Cyprus is rich, diverse, well-published, and frequently enigmatic. Regarded by many as a 1 'bridge'' between western Asia and the Aegean, Cyprus and its past are frequently seen from scholarly perspectives prevalent in one of those two cultural areas. Its material culture, however, differs radically from that of either area. Apart from the early colo nization episodes on the island (perhaps three during the pre-Neolithic and Neolithic), evidence of foreign contact remains limited until the Bronze Age (post-2500 B. C). This study seeks to present the prehistory of Cyprus from an indigenous perspective, and to examine a series of archaeological problems that foreground Cyprus within its eastern Mediterranean context. The study begins with an overview of time, place, and the nature of fieldwork on the island, continues with a presentation and discussion of several significant issues in Cypriot prehistory (e.g., insularity, colonization, subsistence, regionalism, interaction, social complexity, economic diversity), and concludes with a brief discussion of prospects for the archaeology of Cyprus up to and ' 'beyond 2000. KEY WORDS: Cyprus; Eastern Mediterranean; island colonization; insularity; regionalism; com plex society; metallurgical production/exchange; social theory; politics and archaeology. INTRODUCTION Over the course of the last century archaeological excavations on Cyprus, however bleak their origins (Goring, 1988), have produced a rich, diverse, and very well-published material record. If the island's antiquities suffered an "unrestrained onslaught" in the nineteenth century (Karageorghis, 1982, p. 22), 'School of History, Philosophy and Politics, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia. 2 No. 4 Zelgliweg, 8309 Breite/ZH, Switzerland. 3 Department of Classics, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading RG6 2AA, England. 377 0892-7537/94/1200-0377507.00/0 ? 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">378 Knapp [with Held and Manning] by the early twentieth century archaeological fieldwork became more stabilized as a chronological, culture-historical approach took hold (Dikaios, 1947; Myres, 1914). And yet Cyprus's archaeological record and its interpretation have proved to be less than straightforward, particularly in relation to the material evidence and cultural developments in the surrounding, better-known cultures of the Lev ant, the Aegean, and Anatolia. Herein lies one of the main burdens born by the archaeology of Cyprus. British-trained classical archaeologists were the first "professionals" to work on Cyprus; their negative attitude toward Turkey and the Ottoman Empire set in train a long-standing, philhellenic bias that has affected the structure of archae ological research on the island (Frankel n.d.). During the twentieth century, most archaeologists who have worked on Cyprus, including native Cypriotes, were trained first and foremost as specialists in Aegean, Levantine, or Anatolian archaeology, only secondarily in Cypriot archaeology. One result is that the island is typically regarded as a "bridge" between western Asia and the Med iterranean or Europe. Studies of Cypriot material culture therefore envision a gradual, if not static, and relatively peaceful process of evolutionary develop ment, interrupted periodically by stimulus diffusion, immigration, or foreign invasion. Consequently, the ebb and flow of sociocultural developments on Cyprus are associated with external forces, or grounded in scholarly preconcep tions that anticipate Aegean, Levantine, or Anatolian cultural influences (also Merrillees 1975). Cyprus's material culture, however, differs substantially from that of other areas, and apart from the colonization episodes during the "pre-Neolithic" or Neolithic (Held, 1989a; Simmons, 1991), evidence of foreign contact remains limited until the Bronze Age, after about 2500 B.C. (Knapp, 1990a, 1993). To what extent this "isolation" was tied up with the nature of insularity, or in what measure our interpetations hinge on the facile concept of islands as self-sustain ing systems to be understood primarily in their own terms, are issues that deserve close attention but cannot be pursued at length here (Held, 1993). In any case, islands are not necessarily more isolated socioculturally than some other places; in biological, linguistic, and social terms, they are less isolated than mountain valleys (Eriksen, 1993, p. 135). The original peopling of Cyprus resulted from human intention and human design; the foreign contacts initiated and perpetuated by prehistoric Cypriotes eventually brought Cyprus into the politicoeconomic and cultural mainstream of the eastern Mediterranean world. This study seeks to present a prehistory of Cyprus based primarily on the indigenous Cypriot archaeological record, without undue reliance on the prior ities or perspectives of eastern Mediterranean prehistorians, or on the problems associated with the study of other eastern Mediterranean cultures and material culture. To do so, and to retain a sense of balance and scale, I examine several issues that confront archaeologists working on Cyprus; where helpful or nec</page><page sequence="3">Prehistory of Cyprus 379 essary I also consider the implications of prehistoric research elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean. The discontinuities apparent in the Cypriot archaeolog ical record, from the pre-Neolithic through the Late Bronze Age, demand that indigenous developments be examined within a broader Mediterranean context; it does not mean that such discontinuities inevitably can be explained only through recourse to that wider context. Another aspect that typifies the archaeology of Cyprus is the distinction between the approaches of those who specialize in lithics, bioarchaeological data, or skeletal remains, and of those who deal chiefly with architecture, pottery and metals. For example, the ecoenvironmental and spatial problems (insularity, colonization, sedentism, subsistence, regionalism) that motivate the study of the Early Prehistoric period, i.e., the Neolithic and Chalcolithic, may be differen tiated from the politicoeconomic and social issues (isolation, interaction, and political integration; copper production and exchange; social complexity, eco nomic diversity) that engage those who study the Late Prehistoric period, i.e., the Bronze and Iron Ages. Given the different circumstances, types of data, and levels of society, such distinctions are perhaps inevitable. Nonetheless, a ho listic, interpretive archaeology benefits from amalgamation of these approaches, and in addition from the attempt to engage cognitive, social, and contemporary political factors that impact on our interpretations of the archaeological record (Shanks and Hodder, 1994; Tilley, 1993). This review of Cypriot prehistory begins with an overview of temporal issues related to radiocarbon dates and the terminology of time; a brief descrip tion of the environmental context follows. The background and culture-historical nature of field work on the island are portrayed briefly. The several problems that form the focus of discussion are divided between the Early and Late Pre historic periods. Other Cypriot prehistorians might choose a different set of issues, but none?I think?would deny the significance of debating these issues in the attempt to enhance our understanding of prehistoric and protohistoric Cyprus. The study concludes with consideration of some theoretical and political prospects for maintaining and strengthening the vitality of Cypriot archaeology as we approach the third millennium a.d. Terminology and Radiocarbon Time (with Sturt W. Manning) The terminology used for absolute dating or cultural periodization continues to be debated in Old World archaeology (e.g., Gillespie and Gowlett, 1986; Hodder, 1993), where the "Three Age" system (Rodden, 1981; Trigger, 1989, pp. 60-61, 81-82)?increasingly contradicted by regional approaches in world archaeology?remains entrenched, and where temporal terms tend to be employed along with, or as substitutes for, terms that refer to material assemblages. On Cyprus, there has been a tendency to construct inflexible chronological frame</page><page sequence="4">380 Knapp [with Held and Manning] works from overclassified pottery sequences. This situation turned a practical heuristic device?pottery sedation?into a temporal-stratigraphic indicator that still dominates the study of cultural variation or cultural homogeneity. Archae ologists in general regard periodization as the essential, descriptive first stage in constructing cultural or socioeconomic sequences. And whereas they seek to define these chronological indicators neutrally and mechanically, in fact they are composing narratives that seek to delineate origins, evolution, fluorescence, and decline (Hodder, 1993, pp. 279-280). Temporal periods established pri marily from ceramic-sequence dating alone represent artificial templates forced upon the archaeological record (Read, 1989, p. 161), a biased reflection of cultural definition, duration, or transition. Although sequential divisions like early, middle, and late are thus in some respects fictional narratives constructed by contemporary archaeologists, this is not to deny that terms such as Neolithic, Chalcolithic, or Bronze Age have referential value. On Cyprus, however, any attempt to explain or interpret cul tural continuity or discontinuity has been undercut by a strict adherence to this framework, and by a preoccupation with defining or refining this sequence (e.g., Merrillees, 1985). Stanley Price's classic essay (1979a, pp. 1-4) demonstrated that the informal use of the Three Age system on Cyprus (a "stadial" model) became conflated with a "phasal" model based almost exclusively on pottery seriation (e.g., Dikaios, 1962). Because the order that resulted from pottery seriation was deemed to be temporal in nature, each phase was given the status of a period (e.g., Neolithic I, II, III) characterized by a type site (respectively, Khirokitia, Sotira, Erimi). These spatially-defined cultural assemblages, how ever, were not always strictly temporal in nature, and their conflation with chronological terms prejudged their sequence relative to other phases. Stewart (1962, pp. 208, 210-211) and Catling (1973, pp. 165-166) understood the practical difficulties of forcing material into the Neolithic and Chalcolithic sequences, or into a Bronze Age tripartite scheme. The arbitrary criteria devel oped to distinguish "periods" in these traditional schemes often created gaps that could only be explained by catastrophes or invasions; the notion of "tran sitional eras" had to be created in order to incorporate marked continuities in material culture. Discontinuities in the archaeological record, however, became masked or had to be disregarded. This essentially unilinear, evolutionary approach to time regarded material culture as uniform throughout the island; whenever an expected time marker was absent from a certain region, it was assumed that people had abandoned the area (Merrillees, 1966, p. 35; Pelten burg, 1982, p. 99). Recent advances in Cypriot pre- or protohistoric research have prompted a reevaluation of the traditional periodization and the temporal concepts it pre sumes. Developments in radiocarbon dating criteria have provided further pre</page><page sequence="5">Prehistory of Cyprus 381 cision and made it possible to investigate changes in material culture without being bound to spurious time trajectories (Manning and Swiny, 1994; Stanley Price, 1979a, pp. 8-9). The terminological debate concerning prehistoric and protohistoric Cyprus (Coleman, 1992; Frankel, 1988, p. 52, n. 1; Held, 1989a, pp. 17-19; Knapp, 1990a, pp. 148-149; Stanley Price, 1979a; Swiny, 1989, p. 16) may be resolved in part by adopting an approach that asserts the validity of calibrated radiocarbon dating, opposes the use of a single criterion (pottery seriation) to fabricate temporal units, and adopts a socially oriented perspective. New data may then be matched by revision of existing concepts or, at the interpretive level, by discussing material cultural sequences in terms of changing and competing narratives (Hodder, 1993, p. 280). The terminology adopted here (Fig. 1) represents a deliberate break with the Cypriot three-age system and its overconstructed techno-typological divi sions (similarly Coleman, 1992, pp. 283-284). The divisions of the Early Pre historic period into "cultures" (Held, 1989a, p. 18) has found more acceptance than the division of the Late Prehistoric period (Knapp, 1994, p. 276), which is in some respects simply a change in nomenclature. The critical point about this nomenclature, however, is that it provides a much less cumbersome means of discussing gaps, transitional eras, and discontinuities in the material record.

At least the proposed system (PreBA, ProBA) makes it possible to discuss material culture in terms of pattern, process, and human action. The old terminology is retained here and elsewhere (e.g., Knapp and Cherry, 1994) for those who wish to treat stylistic or morphological changes in pottery in greater detail. There follows an attempt to outline a working absolute chronology for Cyprus; in this attempt, attention is focused on the period before about 1700 B.C. (ProBA), where radiocarbon is the major or sole evidence available. The chronology of the ProBA, in any case, is relatively well known from archaeo logical and ethnohistoric evidence, and until the application of high-precision radiocarbon dating (in progress by S. W. Manning and B. Weninger in asso ciation with A. K. South, G. Cadogan, and S. Hadjisavvas), little further can be added to existing discussions (e.g., Merrillees, 1992). The data used are presented in Figs. 2-9. The method of analysis is a two dimensional dispersion calibration carried out on the 1993 high-precision cali bration data in Radiocarbon 35.1 (1993), employing the computer program of B. Weninger (1993; see Weninger, 1986 for the method). The figures show, in the Date List, the individual radiocarbon determinations, their radiocarbon ages B.P., and their approximate calibrated ages B.C. (at one sigma). The diagrams represent the combined calibration of the date list, with the short vertical and horizontal lines showing the central points for each separate determination (radio carbon age B.P., calibrated calendar age B.C.), and the two curves showing the combined radiocarbon probability and the combined calibrated calendar dating probability. It should be noted that there are differences between some of the several different radiocarbon calibration programs available, although their results have proved to be generally consistent, and broadly similar (see, e.g., Aitchison etal., 1989). (1) Earliest occupation: the evidence from Akrotiri Aetokremnos is shown in Fig. 2 (from Simmons, 1991; see Manning, 1991 for discussion of an approx imate reservoir effect of ?400 radiocarbon years on the determinations from shell samples). In either case the majority of the central 50% of the calibrated calendar probability distribution lies in or just after the eleventh millennium B.C. (2) KCU (Aceramic Neolithic): evidence from the two key sites of Khi rokitia Vouni (first 18 dates in list) and Kalavasos Tenta (rest of date list) is shown in Fig. 3 (data from Todd, 1987, p. 174; Cherry, 1990, pp. 150-151; Held, 1992b, pp. 165-167; Le Brun and Evin, 1991). Both sites exhibit a floruit in the mid-late seventh-early sixth millennium B.C.; consistent data exist from other KCU sites such as Cape Andreas Kastros and Dhali Agridhi (see previous</page><page sequence="7">11400 9400 [ calBC/AO] Fig. 2.

A few samples from both main sites offer dates much earlier; some of these are only conjecturally linked to the settlement (e.g., Todd, 1987, p. 174), although they may suggest dates for previous human use of the sites, or for their earliest buildings. (3) SCU (Early Ceramic Neolithic): there is little good evidence, but two determinations from Dhali Agridhi are often cited (see Fig. 4: data from Cole man, 1992, Vol. II, p. 224; Held, 1992b, p. 166). Although they are not obviously similar, and are of varying quality (given the quoted laboratory mea surements), these determinations suggest dates for the early SCU from about the end of the sixth to the early-mid fifth millennium B.C. Better quality data are essential, and will offer the only means of resolving the debate over the "gap" between the KCU and SCU (discussed in detail below). (4) SCU (Late Ceramic Neolithic): the site of Ayios Epikitos Vrysi offers the most relevant data, shown in Fig. 5 (Held, 1992b, pp. 167-168; Coleman, 1992, Vol. II, pp. 224-225; adding GU-251). The majority of the calibrated dates lie in the late fifth millennium B.C. and the very early fourth millennium B.C. (central 50% of the calibrated calendar probability distribution falls between 4240-3980 B.C.). If one allows that these dates often derive from wood and are thus a little older than the context of their cultural employment, and that habitation will have continued after these dates, the end of the SCU may be suggested to lie in the period 3900-3750 B.C. (a few similar dates exist from other sites: see previous references). (5) There is now a relatively large body of data for ECU (Chalcolithic) Cyprus, and a long stratified series from the SCU to the PCU is becoming available from Kissonerga Mosphilia in particular. Here the aim is restricted simply to defining the beginning and end of the Chalcolithic period, not to delineating its divisions and phases (for which see Peltenburg, 1991b, n.d.). For the early ECU, the sites of Kalavasos Ayious and Kissonerga Mylouthkia have been selected as offering representative data, shown combined in Fig. 6 (first four dates in list are from Ayious, the last six from Mylouthkia: data from Held, 1992b, pp. 168-169; Coleman, 1992, Vol. II, p. 225; the wildly aberrant BM-1835R from Ayious, offering a date contemporary with Aetokremnos, is not included). After allowing for the likely difference between the ages of the wood and the date of its likely cultural use, these data imply that the ECU began around the middle of the fourth millennium B.C. (consistent with other early ECU data and the late SCU data cited above). The date for the close of the ECU at present rests on evidence only from the southwest of the island, where the late ECU may have continued longer than in the north, and overlapped with the beginning of the PCU (Manning and Swiny, 1994). Determinations from Lemba Lakkous phase 3 and Kissonerga Mosphilia phase 4 provide the evidence, shown combined in Fig. 7 (first five dates in list are from Lakkous, the last six from Mosphilia: data from Peltenburg, 1991c, p. 10, using only BM-2279R,</page><page sequence="10">Dhali Agridhi 2-D DISPERSION CALIBRATION DATE LIST Lab.M..uaber Oate Std calOC/-A0 Reservoir(SP) CX-2847A 64)5 310 5287 t 299 P-2769 5700! 100 4565! 114 6600L Statistical LiftitS Span [a] 9503 Peak center 4340 ca18C- 5660 caloC 1320 68 1 Peak center 4340 caIlC- 5130 ca18C 790 --- 50 X Ptak center 4360 calBC- 4710 calSC 350 6200 - 6000 - 500 5600 -, 5400 5200 5000 .. . . , , . . . . , . . . . , . . .. . . . , . . . . , . . . . , ..... . ... . . . . . . . . . . 590 5700 5500 5300 5100 4900 4700 4500 4300 4100 390 [ calC/AD) Fig. 4.

The Mosphilia dates are earlier in general, and occupy a difficult "wiggly" period on the calibration curve, in the first half of the third millennium B.C. The Lakkous data therefore are more useful, and suggest dates in the period about 2600-2400 B.C. Since these are dates for the buildings of Lakkous phase 3 (i.e., the beginning of the phase), the date of their destruction at the end of the phase is likely to be perhaps 50-100 years later. Therefore, a date somewhere about 2400-2300 B.C. should mark the end of the ECU (Chalcolithic) in southwest Cyprus (Manning and Swiny, 1994, p. 151). (6) PreBA 1 (Early Bronze Age, or Early Cypriot I-IIIA period): at present, the only data relevant to this period come from Sotira Kaminoudhia (discussed at length in Manning and Swiny, 1994). The determinations, shown in Fig. 8, suggest a date for PreBA 1 (ECI-IIIA in traditional terms) in the period from about 2300-2100 B.C. The much debated PCU (or "Philia phase") appears to overlap with part of the closing ECU (late Chalcolithic) and perhaps also with the start of the early Cypriot period (using the conventional terminology), about 2500-2300 B.C. if not a little later. (7) PreBA 2 (Middle Bronze Age, or Early Cypriot IIIB-Middle Cypriot): The end of PreBA 1 (Early Bronze Age) and start of PreBA 2 (Middle Bronze Age) have traditionally been placed around 2000 B.C. because of approximate links with other cultures (Manning and Swiny, 1994, p. 150). Included in Fig. 9 are three radiocarbon determinations from PreBA 2 contexts at Ambelikou Aletri and Marki Alonia, which appear to confirm this (the first two dates in list are from Ambelikou and the third date is from Marki: data from Manning and Swiny, 1994, p. 153; D. Frankel, personal communication?OZA-279). Finally, four determinations from what are described as MC II or MC I-II (thus also PreBA 2) contexts provide dates centered in the eighteenth century B.C. (dates four and five in list on Fig. 9 are from Marki Alonia, dates six and seven from Alambra Mouttes: data from Manning and Swiny, 1994, p. 153). The end of PreBA 2 might thus be placed a century later, sometime during the seventeenth century B.C. This chronology has been constructed from key sites and datasets, and is intended to be meaningful and interpretative rather than total and comprehensive. If it allows us to move ahead, however tentatively, toward an absolute radio carbon chronology, its purpose has been served. Landscape, Environment, and Subsistence Economy (with Steve O. Held) The island of Cyprus is situated in the northeastern corner of the Mediter ranean, about 70 km south of Turkey and 95 km west of Syria (Fig. 10). Egypt lies some 400 km south and the Aegean islands, beginning with Rhodes, about 480 km west.

General map: Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean. after Sicily and Sardinia. Its coastline embraces several natural harbors; a num ber of Bronze Age sites probably had inner harbors accessible by navigable river mouths or embayments long since desiccated or silted-up (Blue, 1994; Collom bier, 1988; Gilford, 1985a, 1985b; Nicolaou, 1976). There was no post-Miocene landbridge between Cyprus and the Asiatic mainland (Constantinou, 1982, p. 13; Gass, 1968; Stanley Price, 1979b, pp. 1 -5), which means that the island was oceanic in origin (Held, 1989b, pp. 67 69; Swiny, 1988). Geophysical data show that the igneous complex of the southern, Troodos mountain range arose de novo during the late Oligocene or early Miocene, while the mostly sedimentary rocks of the northern, Kyrenia (or Pentadaktylos) range were upthrusted as part of the late Miocene, Tauro-Dinaric belt formation. Despite this orogenic association, a complete lack of vertebrate fossils dating from the Miocene suggests that the Kyrenia range was already inaccessible to Tertiary mainland faunas at the time of its emplacement, and remained isolated even during the Messinian salinity crisis. A major uplifting</page><page sequence="18">394 Knapp [with Held and Manning] of southern Cyprus as a whole occurred at the time of the Plio-Pleistocene transition, and was accompanied through the middle Pleistocene by geomorphic processes resulting in the gradual emergence of the island's present shape (Poole and Robertson, 1991). The continental shelves of Cyprus and the surrounding mainland are generally narrow and separated by sea depths ranging from &gt; 500 m to &gt; 1500 m, greatly in excess of the scale of local tectonism and glacio eustatic sea-level changes during the Pleistocene (cf. Gomez and Pease, 1992). Hence, whereas Cyprus's morphogenesis was ultimately determined by the tec tonic instability of eastern Mediterranean plate boundaries (MacKenzie, 1970), its Quaternary biogeography was controlled not by geologic events but by the abiding presence of the sea. Internally, then, Cyprus's main geophysical features are the two mountain ranges and the central lowland plain that separates them. In the north, a coastal strip nowhere greater than 5 km in width is well watered by rainfall and perennial springs. Three main passes lead through the Kyrenia range to the central lowland region, whose geomorphology is complex. This plain varies both in elevation (from sea level to 230 m asl) and formation: alluvial deposits, silt, and a central limestone plateau are overlaid especially in its eastern sectors with a hardpan calcrete {kafkalla), which itself is occasionally topped by thin layers of terra rossa soils. South and west of the Mesaoria (the major part of the central lowlands), the Troodos Massif dominates the landscape; peaks within the Troo dos range from about 700 to 2000 m, and delimit travel throughout the south and southwest. The ultrabasic core of the Troodos is surrounded by gabbros and an extensive diabase, with an encircling pillow lava series that contain all of Cyprus's sulphide orebodies (Constantinou, 1982, p. 15). Over the previous decade, analysis and publication of some key bioar chaeological data (Croft, 1985, 1989a; Davis, 1989; Le Brun, 1981, 1986; Peltenburg, 1983; Todd, 1987) have helped to expand the still limited evidence related to Cyprus's early Holocene environment (but see Held, 1989b, n.d.a.). Paleoenvironmental reconstruction, however, must still be extrapolated chiefly from twentieth century data sources or from ecologically similar Mediterranean landscapes (e.g., Blumler, 1993). The pronounced gradient of Holocene river valleys has cut deeply into the Troodos Massif and led to widespread erosion along the broad lowland floodplains. Other factors?alluvial deposition, long shore sediments, sandblown dune-formation?led to the infilling of Morphou (west) and Famagusta (east) bays at either end of the Mesaoria, and at the Akrotiri and Larnaca salt lakes (Morel, 1960; Gifford, 1985a; Stanley Price, 1979b, pp. 7-9). The relationship between these erosional or aggradational processes and Holocene climate is controversial. Because close correspondence is thought to exist between early Holocene and present day climate in the eastern Mediterranean (Bintliff and Van Zeist, 1982; Blumler, 1993, pp. 291-293; Bottema et al., 1990), it may be noted that all modern-day Cypriot fresh water</page><page sequence="19">Prehistory of Cyprus 395 sources derive from snowfall in the Troodos and rainfall elsewhere. Rainfall fluctuates markedly, and results almost exclusively from winter (November March) storms; thus major rivers are potentially torrential in winter but desic cated in summer. Lacustrine resources are rare and often undesirable because of high salinity or malarial-mosquito infestation. In such a low rainfall area, forest cover, the nature of local geology, and xerophytic or mesophytic vegetation can have a major effect on riverine stream flow. The role of riparian forests became critical in Holocene vegetation pat terning, and vegetation cover served to check soil erosion triggered by heavy winter rains and erratic summer storms. Whereas natural afforestation occasion ally may have offset the impact of human settlement, plant cultivation, or stock grazing on the forest cover, these mechanisms certainly have contributed to the present-day, severely eroded landscape (Burnet, n.d.; Christodoulou, 1959; Miksicek, 1988, p. 470); Blumler (1993, pp. 298-300) warns, however, that traditional views regarding landscape sensitivity in the Mediterranean may be exaggerated. Throughout the hot and dry lowlands, grass, rock, dwarf shrubs, and xerophytic weeds typify the vegetation; broadleaf cactus (a recent introduc tion) and juniper, as well as carob, olive, and date palm, are also in evidence. Within the foothills of the Kyrenia and Troodos ranges, some xerophile shrub communities have been established, along with carob, fig, almond, and pistachio trees. Isolated stands of cedar and cypress maintain a precarious existence along the Kyrenia range while grapevines carpet the southern and southwestern flanks of the Troodos. Deciduous hardwood trees today are found only above 1200 m, within the Troodos, where in number they take a distant second to conifers or evergreens (pine, cedar, wild cypress, and evergreen Cyprian oak). The "climax" vegetation of early Holocene Cyprus is thought to have been Mediterranean evergreen sclerophyllous forest or maquis dominated by oaks, juniper, and cypress (Held, 1983; Jones et al., 1958, p. 24; Zohary, 1973, map 7). Blumler (1993, pp. 289-291) questions such traditional notions of succes sion, however, and suggests that "climax" vegetation may also have included large-seeded annuals (on fertile soils) or dense, shrubby vegetation (on poor or rocky soils). He also makes the point that early successional plants often create conditions unfavorable to the establishment of their offspring. Such palynolog ical data as exist for the Early Prehistoric period (Renault-Miskovksy, 1985, 1989) show low percentages of arboreal and high percentages of herbaceous pollen. The study of introduced, prehistoric plant remains over the past three de cades has concentrated on the Early Prehistoric (Neolithic-late Chalcolithic) period, much less on the Bronze Age (summarized with references in Hansen, 1991). Most of the products utilized during the Early Prehistoric period are also in evidence at seven Bronze Age sites which have produced paleobotanical evidence (Knapp, 1994, pp. 283-287; Adams and Simmons, 1993). Domesti</page><page sequence="20">396 Knapp [with Held and Manning] cated plants included cereals, such as breadwheat, emmer, naked and hulled barley; pulses, especially lentils; and perhaps olives. A variety of fruits (grape, fig, pomegranate, citrus) and nuts (almonds, hazel, pistachio) were exploited (Astrom and Hjelmqvist, 1987; Hansen, 1989, 1991; Helbaek, 1962, 1966; Hjelmqvist, 1973, 1977; Knapp, 1994, pp. 283-286; Miksicek, 1988; Swiny, 1989, pp. 22-23). Turning to paleoeconomic data, and again treating only introduced species, diachronic patterns of prehistoric animal exploitation on Cyprus indicate decreasing reliance through time (excepting the Chalcolithic) on hunting (fallow deer), and increased emphasis on stock-rearing (Croft, 1985, pp. 295-296, 1989a; Held, 1992a, pp. 111-116). Bioarchaeological data suggest four further patterns (see Table I): (1) predominance of fallow deer, ovicaprid, and pig in all early Prehistoric faunal samples (Davis, 1989; Held, 1992a, p. 112; 1993, p. 29); (2) gradual replacement of pig and deer (Neolithic-Chalcolithic) by cattle (Bronze Age); (3) an apparent increase through time in the proportion of goats relative to sheep (Croft, 1988, p. 452, 1989b); and (4) ovicaprine-dominated assemblages in almost all Bronze Age faunal samples (Hesse et al., 1975, 1983; Halstead, 1977; Ekman, 1977; Jonsson, 1983; Croft, 1989b). Faunal data exist from only a few sites, and we still do not have an adequate sample from a cross-section of sites that would allow unambiguous discussion of these trajectories. Keswani (1994) suggests that the increase in animal husbandry during the Chalcolithic and Prehistoric Bronze Age may be attributed to a variety of socio ideological and ritual requirements, rather than to utilitarian 4"optimizing" prin ciples. In the context of increased population and developing social complexity that characterize those periods, Keswani is certainly correct. And, as Croft (1991, p. 74) has emphasized, the massive sweeping horns of mature male goats Table I.

Yet the patterns apparent in the faunal record will also have involved ecological and environmental factors as well as cultural or behavioral ones. For example, the Bronze Age predominance of cattle over pig or deer may indicate not just dietary or ritual preference but environmental and technological modifications (e.g., forest clearance with bronze tools) associated with new farming techniques in a more open environment (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 156-157). Furthermore, while pig and deer require extensive, usually moist woodlands, sheep and goat prefer drier biotopes (Ekman, 1977, p. 169; Halstead, 1977, p. 267). If the increased goat: sheep ratio is not just a fiction bom out of the current archaeological record, it may indicate anthropogenic environmental pressure (resulting in xerophytic vegetation better suited to goats) as well as a caprine capacity to expand into an ecological niche vacated by a diminishing deer population (Croft, 1989b). The data currently available on the subsistence economy of Early and Late Prehistoric Cyprus reveal no strategies or components unexpected in an agro pastoral economy. Cereals, fruits, and pulses provided one type of staple in the diet, while domesticated ruminants (ovicaprines, cattle) provided both primary (meat) and?by the Bronze Age?secondary (traction, milk, wool) products. Cattle, unknown during the Early Prehistoric period (but see below, p. 404, on the site of Shillourokampos), and equids (horses and asses) were probably used as draught animals in the Late Prehistoric period. Fallow deer served as a major source of protein in the Early Prehistoric period, but increasingly came to be a supplementary source by the Bronze Age. Because the bioarchaeological record is still very limited, and therefore both under-represented and biased, any conclusions about the subsistence econ omy must remain provisional. Based on the sparse faunal database, it may be suggested that forest-dwelling mammalian fauna?Persian fallow deer, and per haps the moufflon (Cypriot feral sheep) or wild pig (Stanley Price and Christou, 1973, p. 30)?complemented the cereal and horticultural (e.g., forest-foraging) diets of Early Prehistoric populations (see also Held, 1992a, pp. 111-116 and Table 1). This pattern had changed by the Bronze Age, as animal husbandry increasingly assumed greater significance. The extent to which the incomplete, composite image portrayed here is representative of Early and Late Prehistoric Cyprus remains to be demonstrated by further empirical evidence. The purpose of this section, in any case, has been to establish the economic and ecological context within which human action or social production took place, and to consider which environmental constraints may have affected social action. Overview of Archaeological Fieldwork on Cyprus After the debacles of nineteenth century "fieldwork" on Cyprus (e.g., Cesnola, 1878), foreign field research between 1920-1940 set an exemplary standard. The exacting culture-historical approach of the Swedish Cyprus Expe</page><page sequence="22">398 Knapp [with Held and Manning! dition (Gjerstad, 1926; Gjerstad etal., 1934; Astrom et al., 1994) was emulated closely in post-1940 field expeditions by French (Schaeffer, 1952), Cypriote (Dikaios, 1953, 1961, 1962), British (Du Plat Taylor, 1952, 1957), Australian (Hennessy, 1964; Stewart, 1962; Stewart and Stewart, 1950), American (Ben son, 1969, 1970, 1972; McFadden, 1946), and further Swedish teams (Astrom, 1966, Astrom and Astrom, 1972; Astrom etaL, 1983). Since 1950, fieldwork by Cypriote archaeologists has made impressive contributions, and provided detailed sequences of architectural preferences, lithic traditions, pottery styles, metallurgical types, and production techniques (e.g., Dikaios, 1953, 1961, 1969 1971; Hadjisavvas, 1992; Karageorghis, 1965, 1983; Karageorghis and Demas, 1984, 1985, 1988). British and French prehistorians brought a multidisciplinary, bioarchaeological dimension to post-1970s archaeology on Cyprus (e.g., Croft, 1985, 1988, 1989b; Le Brun, 1987; Peltenburg, 1983, 1985b, 1991a; Todd, 1987). Catling's pioneering, islandwide survey work of Bronze Age sites (1962) has now been supplemented by regional undertakings of broader methodological and theoretical scope (e.g., Adovasio et at., 1975; Frankel and Webb, 1995; Hadjisavvas, 1983; Held, 1988; Knapp et al., 1992, 1994; Manning and Con well, 1992; S0rensen and Rupp, 1993; Todd, 1989). Despite the multidisciplinary efforts of post-1950 fieldwork and research, the culture-historical approach still dominates Cypriot archaeology (Held, 1990), but with increasingly frequent exceptions. During the 1970s, Stanley Price (1977a; 1977b; 1979b) alone was responsible for bringing "processual" archae ology, and a rigorous survey methodology, to the study of early Prehistoric cultures. More recent advances in radiocarbon calibration, as well as the study of settlement stratigraphy and the use of carefully collected and controlled paleoenvironmental data and locational analyses, have enabled Held to add considerably to Stanley Price's gazetteer, and to produce an important synthesis of the entire early Prehistoric era (1989b, 1992). Cyprus's insularity, the impor tance of biogeography for understanding its colonization, and the crucial role of an absolute chronometric basis have become critical for understanding Early Prehistoric developments. PROBLEMS Early Prehistoric Period Island Colonization, Subsistence, Sedentism, and Overkill (with Steve O. Held) Recent advances in both method and theory have transformed our under standing of the archaeological record of Early Prehistoric Cyprus, enriching as well as extending that era to a time depth hardly contemplated 20 years ago</page><page sequence="23">Prehistory of Cyprus 399 (Fig. 11). Two developments are responsible for sharpening the temporal focus from the largely sequence-dependent picture of the early 1970s to the absolute dating framework of the 1990s: (1) the proliferation of calibrated dates for an increasing number of settlements (see Figs. 2-7) and (2) the discovery of an apparent pre-Neolithic phase of occupation (Manning, 1991; Simmons, 1991a, 1991b, 1992; Swiny, 1988). Although the latter is so far attested only by a single site, its presence provides the first tangible indication that a colonization "episode" took place some millennia prior to the establishment of sedentary village farming communities. (Since this site, Akrotiri Aetokremnos, may rep resent occupation by castaways, or seasonal hunter-gatherers, both on a tem porary basis, its use is qualified as a colonization "episode"). This new evidence does not resolve the long-standing controversy over the possibility of a Paleo lithic occupation of Cyprus (Adovasio etai, 1975, 1978; Baudou, 1982, 1983; Baudou and Engelmark, 1983; Baudou etal., 1985; Stockton, 1968; Vita-Finzi, 1973), yet it has demonstrated that the people of the early Neolithic Khirokitia Culture were not the earliest occupants of the island (cf. Stanley Price, 1977b). It is now clear that human dispersal from the surrounding mainland occurred well before 10,000 B.P.; consequently its cause and effect may be considered briefly in the context of late Glacial biogeography and the few other instances of a global process of Pleistocene island colonizations (Held, 1989b, 1992a; Keegan and Diamond, 1987). To detect patterns of early island settlement, it is necessary first to analyze the paleogeography of island and mainland coastlines, and thus to differentiate between landbridge (or "false") islands and oceanic (or "true") islands, relative to the chronology of a specific process of dispersal and colonization. Although the apparent proximity of Cyprus to early hominid sites in the southern Levant (e.g., Bar-Yosef and Vandersmeersch, 1989; Gilead and Bar-Yosef, 1993; Marks, 1983) might fuel expectations of Aurignacian or even Mousterian mate rial on the island, the most convincing model in fact predicts pre-Neolithic contacts only with the Cilician coast of southern Anatolia, and the survival of contemporaneous sites only on Cyprus's northern coastal plain (Held, 1992a, pp. 109-111). Current political circumstances, however, preclude testing the prediction. The falsifiability of Held's model, it may be stressed, has preceded its testing, inasmuch as the only pre-Neolithic site one can point to lies precisely on the tip of Cyprus's southernmost point. Post-Flandrian water gaps of 69 km to the north and 101 km to the east are small enough for Cyprus to share the same general climatic zone (xero thermo-mediteiTanean) and vegetation types (mediterranean and subhumid med iterranean oak belt formations) with the low-lying coastal regions of southern Anatolia and the northern Levant (UNESCO-FAO, 1963, 1969). Yet the effects of insularity are readily apparent in the late Quaternary fauna, where extremely low species abundance and a high degree of endemism indicate that even under</page><page sequence="24">Akrotiri Phase KCU Cape Andreas MorphouBay J X^sBay Petrato^LimnitiJ Mesaoria Plain ( ^^^^^^^gu ^j[|ra -?^Wasilikos River Valley ^^0_a^^okm ^ AkroW q. _ co 1 3 Fig. 11.

An appreciable change in sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum (minus 120/ 130 m?Shackleton et al., 1984) exposed the Gulf of Iskenderun and the Cilician shelf, reducing the shortest distance between the island and the mainland to approximately 40 km. By about 9000 B.P., mean sea level had risen to within approximately 35 m of present levels, and by about 5000 B.P. was within 1-5 m (Flemming and Webb, 1986; Gomez and Pease, 1992). The remoteness of Pleistocene Cyprus (Held, 1992a, pp. 110-111; Keegan and Diamond, 1987, p. 61), even during maximum marine regressions, helps to explain why it received only two large terrestrial mammals, elephant and hippopotamus, which became sufficiently isolated from their parent gene pool to undergo extreme body size and allometric changes, evolving into the dwarfed endemic forms Elephas Cypriotes and Phanourios minutus, respectively (Boekschoten and Son daar, 1972; Reese, 1989; Sondaar, 1986). Despite much recent effort (e.g., Gomez and Pease, 1992; Poole et al., 1990; Poole and Robertson, 1991), we remain uncertain of the extent to which river floodplains at both ends of the Mesaoria had developed prior to the start of widespread erosion and alluviation in the Holocene. Continuing uncertainty also pertains to the natural vegetation cover (Zohany, 1973, Map 7; cf. Blumler, 1993), and local reconstructions have yet to be systematically tested by paleo ecological and bioarchaeological means (Jones et al., 1958). Regardless of its composition, the main point to be made about the paleoenvironment is that a cover of evergreen, sclerophyllous forest, a depauperate and severely unbalanced terrestrial fauna, and a permanently low level of marine biodiversity in the nutrient-poor waters surrounding Cyprus probably combined to create unfavor able conditions for preagricultural subsistence on the island. While this obser vation might predict the absence of Paleolithic settlement, more importantly it helps to explain recently uncovered archaeological data. Excavations at Akroitiri Aetokremnos. Recent excavations on the Akrotiri Peninsula, at the collapsed south-coast rockshelter site of Aetokremnos, provide the first proof of human activity on Cyprus and predate the aceramic Neolithic Khirokitia Culture (KCU) by at least two millennia (Simmons, 1991; Simmons et al., 1988). The remains consist of a large bone midden containing stone and shell artifacts as well as concentrations of ash tentatively interpreted as casual hearths. The entire deposit was subsequently sealed by massive rock debris when the overhang caved in, which preserved its stratification everywhere except in front of the shelter. Despite the nearly complete excavation of the small shelter, human use of the site can only be inferred from the midden deposit itself, where three principal strata are clearly distinguishable. The lowest consists of a dense concentration of about 250,000 bones and bone fragments of pygmy hippopotamus (220 +</page><page sequence="26">402 Knapp [with Held and Manning] individuals) and dwarf elephants (three subadult individuals) (Reese, 1989, 1993; Simmons, 1988, 1991, p. 862; Simmons and Reese, 1993), while the thinner upper stratum contains predominantly cracked and burned sea shells with an admixture of about 1% of the bone. These two strata are interleaved in places with a sterile sediment layer of windblown sand and limestone precipitate. The associated artifacts comprise almost 95 % of the entire chipped stone assemblage (128 formal tools dominated by a distinctive thumbnail scraper industry), and in addition include a shallow groundstone mortar and several imported, possibly worked igneous stones, more than 100 shell beads, a small number of worked and unworked picrolite objects, as well as a fragmentary, perforated and incised limestone disk. Described as ''technologically efficient/' this assemblage lacks counterparts in the subsequent Khirokitia Culture (KCU), or in any other phase of Cypriot prehistory; it shows some very general similarities with broadly contemporary Levantine or Anatolian materials (Simmons, 1991, pp. 860-862). Were the people responsible for the remains of this apparent "mini-mega faunal" kill-site the first long-term colonists of Cyprus? If so, were they seden tary or mobile, and what besides pygmy hippopotamus and elephant made up their subsistence diet? Although the site is clearly an in situ cultural deposit and thus archaeological in nature, its huge faunal assemblage would rank it also as one of the Mediterranean's foremost paleontological sites. Despite the abun dance of "meat on the hoof," the occupants of the rockshelter exploited other species, including some of Cyprus's impoverished endemic fauna: marine inver tebrates (crabs, sea urchins, limpets, topshell) and avifauna (great bustard, dove, goose, grebe, shag, teal). In addition, there is evidence of burnt eggshell and land snails, and more limited numbers of fish, turtle, snake, and a genet (Held, 1992a, pp. 111-119; Simmons, 1991, p. 862). The question of sedentary occupation at Aetokremnos is bound up with broader, more complex issues of post-Pleistocene island colonization. In the mainland southern Levant, where evidence is much more extensive and spread over thousands of years, there is still little agreement on the timing and nature of the earliest sedentary communities, or on the manner in which different mobility patterns may have complemented, competed with, or developed into more broad-based, sedentary economic strategies (e.g., Edwards, 1989; Kauf man, 1992; Lieberman, 1993). In the Mediterranean, where it was long thought that most islands were too impoverished to support hunter-gatherer groups lack ing a food-producing technology (Cherry, 1981, pp. 41-42), recent evidence suggests that the lack of earlier (i.e., Paleolithic) occupations may have resulted from avoidance rather than from ignorance or inability to colonize (e.g., Cherry, 1990, pp. 193, 202; Perles, 1979). On Cyprus, parts of the Akrotiri Peninsula may have supported a marsh or lagoon environment attractive to pygmy hip popotami, but inadequate paleoenvironmental data make it difficult to confirm this proposition (cf. Christodoulou, 1959; Held, 1983, 1989b, pp. 178-193; Jones etal., 1958; Stanley Price, 1979b, pp. 1-15).</page><page sequence="27">Prehistory of Cyprus 403 In light of the nearly total excavation of the Aetokremnos midden, the excavator has proposed a "nondomestic economic strategy" (Simmons, 1991, p. 866). The excavated remains, together with a suite of consistent radiocarbon dates (Fig. 2), suggest that we are dealing with conventional pre-Neolithic hunter gatherers, not with some specialized Neolithic adaptation to an unusual ecolog ical setting. Alternatively, if food gathering or food producing were involved, they may have adopted a hunting strategy to suit local conditions (David Frankel, personal communication). In any case, the striking shift in emphasis from hip popotami in the lower stratum to avifaunal and marine resources in the upper signals an economic shift, as the mammalian resources dwindled below the group's subsistence needs (Simmons, 1991, p. 866). On present evidence, Aeto kremnos appears to be a specialized processing site that belongs to a uniquely Cypriot pre-Neolithic, "Akrotiri phase," or focus, of human presence on the island (Held, 1989b, p. 10; Simmons et al., 1988). How important is Akrotiri Aetokremnos in the debate over the human role in megafaunal extinctions of the end of the Pleistocene (e.g., Diamond, 1989; Martin and Klein, 1984; Vigne, 1987, 1990)? As Cherry and others have empha sized (Cherry, 1990, pp. 175-177; Sondaar, 1987; Sondaar et ai, 1986), the archaeology of Mediterranean islands during the 1980s has demonstrated clearly an overlap between humans and certain endemic Pleistocene fauna which since became extinct. And whereas the high antiquity and abundance of the material excavated at Aetokremnos?not just of pygmy hippopotami and dwarf elephants but of other extinct fauna (Held, n.d.a) embedded in an anthropogenic context? increasingly claims academic as well as popular attention (e.g., Davis, 1985, 1991; Reese, 1993; Simmons and Reese, 1993; Schule, 1993, pp. 405-407; Sondaar, 1986), Cherry (1990, p. 195) urges caution in proclaiming human guilt in the extinction process. The archaeological sample is quite limited and the erratic evolution of Pleistocene fauna, together with a suite of ecological and biogeographic constraints, make it impossible to distinguish proximate from ultimate cause (cf. Corsica?Vigne, 1987, 1990). Even if the evidence from Akrotiri Aetokremnos makes clear the overlap between humans and extinct fauna, are the occupants of one site likely to have caused the loss of Cyprus's entire Pleistocene megafauna (Davis, 1989, p. 191; Swiny, 1989, p. 180)? Was the occupation of Aetokremnos in the tenth millennium B.C. permanent or was it simply the earliest-known utilization of the island (Cherry, 1990, p. 198)? Even if we accept a scenario of purposeful colonization, this does not imply an ancestral link with the food-producing, Neolithic, Khirokitia Culture (KCU). There are radical differences between Akrotiri Aetokremnos and the typical KCU settlement site: in terms of type (rock-shelter vs. open-air settle ment); function (specialized activity vs. residential), degree of sedentism (short term vs. permanent), subsistence base (hunter-gatherer vs. agricultural), diag nostic artifacts (small portable tools vs. finely carved groundstone vessels and figurines, obsidian, pendants) and demographic size (Held, 1989b, p. 147;</page><page sequence="28">404 Knapp [with Held and Manning] 1992a, pp. 119-120). The site of Aetokremnos, which still stands alone in temporal terms, has not produced enough material to be defined in terms of a "culture" in the archaeological sense. There is virtually nothing to show a sequential development toward the KCU, particularly not the dates: the floruit of the KCU is separated by over 2000 (calibrated) years from that of Akrotiri Aetokremnos (Held, 1989b, p. 148). Finally, despite the substantial theorizing and material culture comparisons undertaken by both Stanley Price (1977a, 1977b) and Held (1989a, pp. 7-10; 1989b, pp. 148-158; 1993, p. 27), the geographical origin of the island's first visitors or colonists remains unknown. In sum, the material evidence from Akrotiri Aetokremnos does not allow us to determine definitively whether that site and the "Akrotiri phase" represent a failed colonization attempt. In the following 2000 years (cf. Held, 1992b, p. 125, S/355, and p. 131, S/446), the only archaeological evidence for further human presence on the island may be the site of Paraklesia Shillourokampos (Guilaine et al., 1993), which, according to an announcement made at the 1994 meetings of the American Schools of Oriental Research, has been radiocarbon dated to the seventh millennium B.C. and has a large quantity of cattle bones. Two millennia after Aetokremnos, however, we find a vigorous, island-wide, materially uniform, and unique cultural phenomenon, known variously as the Khirokitia Culture, or the Aceramic Neolithic. Khirokitia Culture (KCU). The KCU flourished during the late seventh early sixth millennium B.C., but probably extended over at least 1500 years, from about 7000-5500 B.C. (Held, 1992b, p. 164, Table 2). This pre-pottery Neolithic culture is represented by sizeable (up to three hectares at Khirokitia Vouni?Le Brun, 1992, p. 22, Fig. 1), fully sedentary villages whose inhabitants combined hunting with mixed farming and herding as subsistence strategies (Le Brun et al., 1987). Nine sites have been at least partially excavated, and another 16 are known from features or diagnostic artifacts; a further eight are thought to have KCU affiliations (Held, 1989b, p. 769 [map A]; 1992a). Only three sites have been excavated extensively: Khirokitia Vouni (Dikaios, 1953; Le Brun, 1986, 1989); Kalavasos Tenta (Todd, 1987); and Cape Andreas Kastros (Le Brun, 1981). Despite the long duration of the KCU and the quantity of sites, such variation as exists amongst them suggests functional rather than temporal differences (Cherry, 1990, p. 156): e.g., between larger, more "com plex," and occasionally walled sites such as Khirokitia Vouni, Kalavasos Tenta, and perhaps Kholetria Ortos (Fox, 1988; Pearlman, 1993; Simmons and Corona, 1993) and smaller, seasonally occupied or specialist sites like Kataliondas Kour vellos (Morrison and Watkins, 1974; Watkins 1979), or Limnitis Petra tou Limniti (Gjerstad et al, 1934, pp. 1-12). One group of sites, presumably the earliest, is concentrated along the north ern and eastern coasts, whilst another group is found at the lowland-upland ecotone some distance from the coasts. Whereas the former locations were either</page><page sequence="29">Prehistory of Cyprus 405 original landfall sites (Stanley Price, 1977a, p. 32) or the area of primary adap tive settlement (Held, 1989b, p. 200), the latter may be attributed to the needs of a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy (arable soils in the lowlands, hunting grounds in the uplands) (Held, 1992a, p. 120; Watkins, 1981). Encircling (defensive? symbolic?) walls or ditches were eventually disregarded as intrasite building space expanded (Le Brun, 1985). Although it is uncertain what sort of pressures the KCU colonists placed on available resources, ethnohistoric and comparative evidence indicates that initial colonizations tend to disperse rapidly (Sutton, 1990, p. 682; Held, 1989b, pp. 193-204, proposes three possible "col onization paths"). The mainly circular, stone and mudbrick structures of the KCU range from 3 to 6 m in diameter, and were densely packed within each settlement. Interiors were characterized by hearths, platforms against the walls (for sleeping?), and often a central post, presumably to support a roof (LeBrun et aL, 1987, p. 293, Figs. 10-11). One interior plastered wall at Kalavasos Tenta sported a wall painting in red pigment of the upper torso of two human figures (Todd, 1987, pp. 47-48, and Fig. 29). The most striking aspects of material culture from this period are the characteristic gray-green stone bowls, often decorated with grooved lines and dots in relief (LeBrun et aL, 1987, p. 300, Fig. 17), and the human heads and animal figurines made of similar material (e.g., Pearlman, 1993, Fig. 68). These artifacts are unique to Cyprus, and stand in contrast to the compar atively mediocre lithic assemblages. The amount of energy expended in the production of stone vases and figurines is perhaps best understood in the context of an insular, somewhat isolated ace ramie culture, unique at this time in the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia. The dead were buried in contracted positions, within shallow pits beneath floors or just outside the structures (Le Brun et aL, 1987, p. 294, Fig. 12). A large stone frequently was placed on the chest of the deceased, and burial offerings (pins, pendants, necklaces) were common. Several mortuary features may have originated in the Levant (e.g., single inhumations, placing of stones on the body, treatment of the skull, etc.; see Stanley Price, 1977b, pp. 79-83). Turning to other aspects of the KCU, whereas deer hunting (Dama Meso potamica) was always important, raw counts show that the total meat supply was reliant mainly on sheep and goat (Croft, 1989b, p. 107, Table 4.13; see also Table I). In addition to animal food and products, the people of the KCU also utilized a range of domesticated plants, including cereals and several pulses, and a limited inventory of nondomesticated fruits and nuts (Hansen, 1988, 1991). Farming and herding provided the mainstays of subsistence throughout the Early Prehistoric period, but hunting, fishing (Cape Andreas Kastros), and foraging also played important roles. Even though such a broad-based economy was more resilient than the meat- and fowl-based diet available to the hunters at Akrotiri Aetokremnos, occasional food crises could still be expected. Such</page><page sequence="30">406 Knapp [with Held and Manning] crises resulted from a range of environmental (e.g., forest clearance, soil deple tion, erosion) or climatic (drier conditions during the mid-Holocene) factors, and from the more general constraints that a bounded island ecosystem placed upon the availability of fertile soils. These factors may also have been instru mental in the practice of "settlement drift" (sites were seldom occupied for more than one cultural period) so common throughout Cypriot perhistory, and in the demographic or cultural "involution" that may have occurred at the end of the KCU. Nonetheless, the longevity of the KCU indicates that these early colonists succeeded not only in stocking the island with an ungulate population that would be critical for the well-being of all successive generations, but also in adapting well to the natural limitations of their insular environment. Khirokitia Culture (KCU) to Sotira Culture (SCU): An Occupational Gap? Despite its size, and close proximity to the western Asiatic mainland, Cyprus received only obsidian, carnelian, and shell from external sources throughout the early Prehistoric period (Stanley Price, 1977b, pp. 74, 84-85; Stanley Price and Christou, 1973, p. 28; Todd, 1988, pp. 15-17). During the time of the Sotira Culture (SCU), pottery technology (generically similar to Syro-Cilician pottery) was introduced to the island. Although Cyprus was never hermetically sealed off from the surrounding world, the paucity of imports is striking (about 100 pieces of obsidian, 40 carnelian beads, some dentalium shells). Was this isolation reinforced by geography (insularity) and technology, or was it to some extent "self-imposed," a product of conscious agency and identity processes (for an ethnographic analogy, see Eriksen, 1993, pp. 140-141)? Held (1993) marshalled a strong case for insularity as a "modifier" of cultural change on prehistoric Cyprus. What geneticists term the "founder prin ciple"?the founding population of an island will not carry the entire gene pool of the parent population from which it derived?may also affect cultural evo lution (Vayda and Rappaport, 1973, pp. 134-135). In this case, the founding culture (KCU) would not have been able to reproduce fully its original ("home land") culture, a factor that would have had a major impact on social and material developments during the Early Prehistoric period. Stanley Price (1977a) summarized the implications of the founder effect on the KCU in terms of a distinctive material culture, burial practices, and the physical anthropology of the presumed colonizers. Building on the work of Angel (1953, 1961; see also Walker, 1974-75), Domurad (1986, 1989) took this approach one step further, and compared limited cranial data sets from prehistoric Anatolia (Mersin, Tar sus) and Syria (Bybios, Ras Shamra) with those from Khirokitia and Sotira. Ras Shamra revealed the closest parallels, but the evidence was Bronze Age in date, and presented further comparative problems with later material from Cyprus itself (Charles, 1962; Domurad, 1989, p. 69). More relevant, the cranial evi dence suggests that the SCU and KCU populations had distinctive origins; at</page><page sequence="31">Prehistory of Cyprus 407 the very least, the KCU skeletal evidence?from Khirokitia, Sotira, and Philia Drakos A?is internally quite consistent (Walker, 1974-75, pp. 89-91). Although the differences may have resulted from the small, nonrepresentative sample sizes, the lack of continuity in KCU and SCU archaeological data also suggests that we are dealing with different populations. Coupled with the perceived chron ological hiatus between the two cultures, the blank between the archaeological records has assumed canonical status as "the gap." New radiocarbon dates have decidedly altered the original chronometric picture. Whereas the first estimate of the gap, or more precisely of the absence of radiocarbon-dated material remains, extended from about 57/5500-3500 B.C., it soon narrowed to 4950-3700 B.C. (Dikaios, 1961). Current estimates reduce the gap to as little as 300-700 calendar years (see Fig. 1). The KCU may have extended through the latter half of the sixth millennium B.C. or even into the early fifth millennium B.C. (Held, 1992a, p. 121), whilst radiocarbon data from Dhali Agridhi II indicates the presence of pottery-producing (thus SCU) groups about the same time or just a little later, approximately 4750 B.C. (see also Lehavy, 1974; Stanley Price, 1977a, pp. 34-35). The continuous development from monochrome to painted pottery in stratigraphic sequences at Philia Drakos Site A (Watkins, 1970, 1973), and Watkins' claim (1981, p. 11) that the earliest phase of Philia Drakos (Al) is comparable in date with Dhali Agridhi II, also helps to fill the gap, albeit without radiocarbon underpinning (Cherry, 1990, p. 157). Similarly, the apparently transitional, KCU-SCU stratigraphy at Klepini Troulli (Peltenburg, 1979) indicates a period of abandonment (no monochrome pottery) during the earliest SCU, but again there are no radiocarbon dates to link these data firmly in time. On the basis of about two dozen radiocarbon dates, the SCU seems to have flourished from about 5000 to 3900 or 3700 B.C. (Held, 1989b, pp. 240-243). How does the radiocarbon-based "gap" compare with the evidence of settlement and subsistence patterns? The archaeological record overall conveys the impression of internal coherence and regional expansion for the SCU (Held, 1992a, p. 121). As with the KCU, there are too few sites (10 out of 34 identified as SCU) partially or fully excavated to allow a thorough reconstruction of spa tiotemporal demographic developments. The people of the SCU were sedentary, probably mainly egalitarian farmers, herders, and deer hunters who occupied subrectangular "houses" in nucleated settlements often situated in a topograph ically prominent position. In terms of material culture, the use of pottery? which developed from a dark, burnished monochrome to a red-on-white ware with painted or combed decoration?became prominent, perhaps replacing in part the distinctive plain or incised groundstone vessels typical of the KCU; large saddle querns for grinding grains or nuts also became prominent. Faunal evidence shows a continuing dependence on ovicaprines, pig, and deer, with a heavy reliance on the last (Croft, 1989a, p. 246; Held, 1992a, pp. 121-122).</page><page sequence="32">408 Knapp [with Held and Manning] The complexities of the Early Prehistoric period make it problematic to assume that an isolated or involuted prepottery KCU simply died out in the late sixth millennium B.C., eventually to be replaced over the course of the next two millennia by a newly introduced, pottery-producing population known as the Sotira Culture (or Ceramic Neolithic). Neither dating criteria (already reviewed) nor demographic modeling support this notion. Held (1989b, pp. 171 208; 1992a, pp. 125-143) has examined all possible colonization and extinction episodes (faunal and human) that might have occurred on Early Prehistoric Cyprus, and concluded from quantitative regional demographic trends that an "involution" model fits the data for the KCU-SCU transition much better than a "continuity" or an "extinction" model (Held, 1992a, p. 162, Fig. 6; cf. Stanley Price, 1977a, pp. 35-37, Fig. 3). Indeed, it is hard to imagine that a culture so well established and geographically widespread could have collapsed so catastrophically as to wipe out the entire population (Cherry, 1990, p. 157). Very dry environmental conditions stemming from the onset of the post glacial Climatic Optimum (about 5600 B.C.) may have impacted negatively on the sedentary, agropastoral subsistence strategies of the KCU communities (Held, 1992a, pp. 136-137). The resulting crop failures and/or famines required major adaptive strategies: community fissioning, the abandonment of village field sys tems, and renewed heavy reliance on deer hunting. If Held's "involution" model with its hypothesized remnant KCU population is correct, the changes in material culture that become evident during the early/mid-fifth millennium B.C. must be associated with a "booster immigration" (not a recolonization), which ended decisively the decline of the island's indigenous population. Acculturation between newcomers and the indigenous population would have been inevitable in the long run, although some period of adjustment? perhaps indicated by defensive works in such sites as Ayios Epiktitos Vrysi and Philia Drakos A (Stanley Price, 1977a, p. 37)?is also possible. An acculturation process is certainly not at odds with the clear material differences between the KCU and the SCU: remove the pendants, obsidian, stone vessels, and circular houses of the KCU and it would be difficult to isolate it as a distinct archaeo logical entity (Held, 1992a, p. 137). The dolichocranial population at Sotira Teppes can be readily distinguished from the brachycranial population at Khi rokitia Vouni, but it makes no difference to an involution model whether this was the result of intraspecific regional variation resulting from the small Sotira sample, or whether there were in fact two distinctive populations. The new SCU sites and their material correlates, in other words, represent both cultural con tinuity and cultural change, most likely the result of a second immigration to the island no later than the early fifth millennium B.C., and the acculturation of those immigrants to the remnants of the KCU population. Both demographic and chronometric data therefore indicate that "the gap" does not represent an actual break in occupation but rather a temporary dearth of settlement.</page><page sequence="33">Prehistory of Cyprus 409 The SCU immigration has been associated with an apparent "marked increase of population densities in the Syro-Cilician interaction sphere during the 6th millennium calBC" (Hours and Copeland, 1983, pp. 81-83; Held, 1992a, p. 143). But until we have more sustainable evidence than the highly imaginative, overseas pottery links that are alternatively proposed (e.g., Dikaios, 1936, p. 42; Watkins, 1973, p. 49) and then deconstructed (e.g., Peltenburg, 1985c, pp. 27-29), it seems prudent to forego further speculation on the origin of the island's SCU immigrants. Whatever the answer may be, after the SCU, signs of sporadic contacts between Cyprus and the mainland increase, however marginally, and the concept of a closed, insular culture becomes more and more untenable. Sotira and Erimi (ECU) Cultures: Integration or Regionalism? The landscape of the SCU was characterized by small, similarly organized village settlements, made up of crowded single-room structures (e.g., Dikaios, 1961; Peltenburg, 1985a) and lasting just over 1000 years (about 5000-3900 B.C.; see Fig. 1). Most SCU sites were situated along the north coast, in the western Mesaoria, or throughout the southern chalklands. Evidence from exca vations reveals several occupational phases followed by abandonment; evidence from surveys shows very few pottery-bearing sites that overlap the juncture between the Neolithic SCU and the subsequent Chalcolithic, Erimi Culture (ECU) (Peltenburg, 1993, p. 10; but cf. Held, 1992a, pp. 122-123). Further more, no SCU site shows evidence of any architectural developments that pre saged the distinctive circular structures of the ECU sites (Peltenburg, 1978; 1982, pp. 51-67). On the basis of a destruction level at the type site of Sotira Teppes (Dikaios, 1961), it is assumed?not altogether convincingly?that an earthquake or series of quakes struck the southern reaches of the island, forced villagers to abandon their homes for subterranean or "squatter" settlements, and triggered population movements that are inferred from quantitative changes in regional demographic patterns. The SCU-ECU transition is widely agreed to be an indigenous and fairly rapid process, not least because a few ECU features have recognizable SCU cognates, for example the generic red-on-white painted pottery (cf. Peltenburg, 1982, pp. 44-47). Nonetheless, excavation and survey evidence alike indicates widespread abandonment, dislocation, or fissioning of villages, what Peltenburg (1993) terms "settlement discontinuity" (see below). Furthermore, from this transitional period onward, several new trends become apparent: style of archi tecture, use of space, more intensive use of blue-green picrolite and first use of copper, groundstone technology, social organization, and symbolic or ideolog ical conventions (Held, 1992a, p. 122; Peltenburg, n.d.). Peltenburg (n.d.) has established a culture-historical division comprising three Chalcolithic stages (early, middle, late), which flourished for as long as</page><page sequence="34">410 Knapp [with Held and Manning] 1500 years?about 3900-2400 B.C. (see Fig. 1). During this time Cyprus expe rienced a remarkable expansion of settlement (Held, 1989b, p. 772, map D), and presumably of population. Held (1992a, pp. 122-123) calculates at least 125 ECU sites, plus 48 sites that show aspects of both the SCU and ECU; the last factor tends to indicate a more "seamless" transition than some would allow (e.g., Peltenburg, 1982, pp. 49-53). Excavated settlements such as Erimi Pamboula, Lemba Lakkous, and Kissonerga Mosphilia reveal a striking longev ity (Dikaios, 1936; Heywood et al., 1981; Peltenburg, 1985b, 1991a, n.d.). The principal attributes of the ECU include diversified, and especially western settlement locations; predominantly curvilinear architecture (vs. the subrectan gular structures of the SCU); communal storage facilities (innovation); red-on white pottery with new design elements that show some regional diversity; elaborated stone bowls; the earliest, very limited occurrence of cold-hammered copper objects; and finely carved picrolite cruciform idols, as well as picrolite beads and other pendants (Held, 1992a, p. 123; Peltenburg, 1982, pp. 51-54; Vagnetti, 1991). In the realm of subsistence, deer continued to play a significant role, although ovicaprines and pigs steadily replaced them during the long course of the ECU (Croft, 1991; see also Table I). Domesticated crops included emmer, wheat, barley, rye and oats, whilst olive, grape and pistachio continued to be collected. Although the mortuary record of both the SCU and ECU reveals inhuma tions, often juveniles, flexed or crouched in simple pits devoid of accompanying goods and oriented in cardinal directions, most ECU burials were more closely integrated with buildings than were those of the SCU. The major exception is the cemetery complex at Souskiou, on the edge of a rocky plateau and very narrow ravine in the southwestern Dhiarizos River Valley (Christou, 1989; Vag netti, 1980). The deep shafts with multiple burials, physically isolated from the only known Chalcolithic settlement on the hillside opposite (Edgar Peltenburg, personal communication; cf. Hadjisavvas, 1977, pp. 228-231, and Fig. 2), are otherwise unknown in the entire Early Prehistoric material record. Unlike most ECU burials, these were accompanied by an array of funerary offerings: zoo morphic and anthropomorphic vessels; bone pendants and picrolite cruciform figurines; a necklace with dentalium spacers and variously shaped pendants; an incised copper ornament, etc. (Christou, 1989, Figs. 12.4-12.10). Manning (1993, p. 43) equates these remains with the development of lineages possessing certain social rights and social status. By the time of the mainphase ECU (Peltenburg's Middle Chalcolithic), locational analysis indicates steady population growth along the north coast and in the center of the island, but very rapid growth in the southwest and decline in the southeast (Held, 1989b, pp. 203-204; 1992a, p. 138). Ostensibly, because the concept of regionalism on prehistoric Cyprus is so engrained in the literature, it should be possible to define demographic and distributional variability during</page><page sequence="35">Prehistory of Cyprus 411 all phases of the ECU, in regional terms. Thus far, however, this possibility exists only in the southwest, where a long-term field project from the University of Edinburgh is conducting an impressive program of excavation and survey (e.g., Peltenburg, 1985b, 1991a). One must ask, therefore, (1) to what extent the concept of regionalism?at least in the Chalcolithic?is based on the perhaps overrepresented material from Cyprus's southwest, and (2) whether the overall cultural pattern is by and large integrated, but one with regional pottery group ings which have been summoned to serve as surrogates for all material culture, and for the people who created and made use of it? The notion that prehistoric society on Cyprus must be broken down into distinct regional groups has long configured how archaeologists regard cultural continuity and change, and how they attempt to resolve chronological discrep ancies (e.g., Astrom, 1972; Herscher, 1981; Merrillees, 1965, 1971; Pelten burg, 1978; Stewart, 1962, p. 296). Although regional factions surely must have existed on prehistoric Cyprus, it is necessary to challenge the assumption that pottery serves as the sole indicator of prehistoric cultural development and change. Any example of Neolithic or Chalcolithic research drawn at random from the surrounding eastern Mediterrannean cultures demonstrates the partiality of such an opinion (e.g., Alton and Levy, 1989; Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, 1989; Bar-Yosef and Khazanov, 1992; Demoule and Perles, 1993; Perles, 1992). Furthermore, because all interpretations based primarily on pottery types or lithic industries revolve around the definition and subsequent recognition of ideal types, the dynamic aspects of these technologies become obscured. Static typol ogies, furthermore, are inherently restricted to spatiotemporal issues (Neeley and Barton, 1994, p. 287) and typically have been unconcerned with broader social, economic, or ideational concerns. In the Cypriot case, Bolger (1987, p. 75) rightly maintains that "... we should recognize the limitations of pottery as a barometer of cultural unity," and that both artifactual and bioarchaeological evidence must be brought to bear if we are to understand the 44. . . seemingly erratic patterns of emergence and subsidence of regionalism as a factor in the evolution of Chalcolithic society." With regard to both the SCU that preceded the Chalcolithic period, and the Philia Culture (PCU)/early Cypriot period that followed it, regionalism is used primarily to refer to divergent pottery traditions within an overall cultural unity. For example, Peltenburg (1978, p. 74) states The emergence of regional [SCU] groups, most clearly illustrated by co-existent styles of pottery, set a pattern which . . . became an abiding feature of subsequent periods on the island. The links with the Erimi culture are strong and indicate a cultural continuum . . . which may well have persisted through the upheavals that ushered in the Bronze Age. Bolger (1987; 1988, pp. 123-134) examined a range of ECU material (e.g., pottery, domestic architecture, spatial organization, groundstone industry), and</page><page sequence="36">412 Knapp [with Held and Manning] came to the conclusion that no distinctive western regional component of the ECU could be identified for the early and middle Chalcolithic periods; if it existed at all for the late Chalcolithic it might well be ascribed to the "hazards of excavation" (1987, p. 74), i.e., an inevitable result of the intensive fieldwork on ECU sites in the southwest. More recently Bolger (1991) has argued for localized centers of "stylistic production" already during the Middle Chalco lithic. From the perspective of Cypriot insularity and the related social and eco logical constraints, Held (1993, p. 28) suggests that ECU settlements did not necessarily follow divergent, regional pursuits. Rather the practice of settlement relocation provided communities with access to new agricultural land in thor oughly familiar habitats. Dual subsistence strategies?agropastoralism and deer hunting?seem to have supported adequately the villagers of the ECU, and neutralized the possible development of population, urbanization, and social hierarchies. Moreover, these dual strategies represent a very efficient use of natural, social, and cognitive resources, and may help to explain the Cypriot pattern of locally shifting, often temporally overlapping, settlements or site clusters (similarly, Stanley Price, 1979b, pp. 75-77). In many respects, Held's assessment of social developments during the Chalcolithic may be regarded as minimalist, especially inasmuch as he questions whether the relevant sites have yielded sufficient evidence to discern the exis tence of power differentials or decision-making authorities. At most, and in contrast to Peltenburg (e.g., 1991a, 1991b, 1993), Held (1993, pp. 28-29) argues that certain distinctive Middle-Late Chalcolithic structures at Kissonerga Mosphilia may indicate "some consensual caretaker" or even the existence of a "rudimentary social rank" amongst social elders. Even if incipient social hierarchies existed in the Chalcolithic, they need not represent regionally empowered elites or social stratification as much as the side effects of ecological and subsistence strategies that helped to perpetuate a successful social and eco nomic system. Peltenburg (1993) regards a Middle Chalcolithic structure at Mosphilia as the property of an elite group who distributed quantities of food during public feasting ceremonies, and whose status dictated that they would preside over other public ceremonies. Nearby were two other remarkable units containing several features and over fifty objects, most significantly a clay model of a building and several broken figurines, one clearly showing a woman giving birth (Peltenburg, 1991a, pp. 12-22, 39-55; 1992). Even if Peltenburg (1993, pp. 14-15) overstates his case, it seems quite likely that these assemblages served ceremonial purposes (birthing rituals) and were most likely preserved by virtue of deliberate deposition. If so, Mosphilia provides good evidence for communal ritual activity. During the final stages of occupation at Mosphilia (periods 4-5, Late Chal</page><page sequence="37">Prehistory of Cyprus 413 colithic), the structures were smaller, the figurines seem to have gone out of use, and a new, technically proficient and standardized type of pottery (mono chrome) was being produced. The so-called "Pithos House" from period 4 at Mosphilia, larger in size (10 m in diameter) and but similar in features (central hearth) to most contemporary structures, contained over 40 pithoi, which gave it an unusual storage capacity. Taken in context with its associated artifacts ("ladle"-handled bowls; a concentration of conical stones, implictly associated with western Asiatic "tokens"?Schmandt-Besserat 1992), Peltenburg (1993, p. 15) suggests that the Pithos House might have served as a central storage and redistribution center. Peltenburg links the abandonment of the "Pithos House," the apparent desertion of Mosphilia (end of the Middle Chalcolithic), and its reoccupation, to a three-stage, evolutionary trajectory for all Early Prehistoric periods: from homogeneity, to hierarchical differentiation, to abandonment and relocation or reoccupation. According to Peltenburg (1993, p. 17), "this pattern suggests that communal fissioning was an important check on the excessive accumulation of power." Alternatively, the recurrent settlement discontinuity evident in the Neo lithic-Chalcolithic material record may represent a "self-regulating" response to human-induced environmental disruptions (e.g., depleted soil fertility; over exploitation of forests), or to the effects of drought, disease or other disasters. Human motivation, social and envrionmental constraints, and incipient aspira tions toward political power all help to account for the discontinuities highlighted by Peltenburg, as well as for the relatively late emergence of complex social systems on Cyprus (in comparison with its neighbors). The Late Chalcolithic period, as defined by material from southwestern Cyprus, witnessed several novel features (e.g., elaborate burials, intensified agricultural production, perhaps centralized storage and external contacts) that may have catalyzed structural changes in society (Peltenburg, 1993, p. 20). Manning (1993, pp. 41-43), however, has queried Peltenburg's (1991b, p. 18) population estimates for Lemba and Mosphilia, and argued that population is an inadequate criterion for establishing the existence of social stratification. Held (1993, pp. 29-30), moreover, maintains that the population of prehistoric Cyprus did not become "saturated" until the PreBA, when involvement in maritime interaction spheres brought an end to Cypriot isolation. The people of Chalcolithic Cyprus pursued a dual subsistence strategy well suited to an insular ecological setting. Environmental and social constraints served to maintain both the population and the social system at the level of autonomous, essentially egalitarian villages. Indicators of surplus and special ized production suggest that, from the mid-fourth millennium B.C. onwards, some growth was sustainable and that society may have become ranked to a certain degree. Yet the Chalcolithic way of life was rural, parochial, and essen tially self-sufficient, simultaneously inhibiting the emergence of central places</page><page sequence="38">414 Knapp [with Held and Manning] (Held, 1993, p. 28). Peltenburg's (1991b, p. 27) "emerging asymmetrical social relationships" during the Middle-Late Chalcolithic may also be seen as incipient forms of material, cultural, and social factors that became much more intensified in a completely transformed set of politicoeconomic circumstances during the third millennium B.C. (Knapp, 1993, pp. 89-90). This should not be construed as an inevitable evolutionary sequence, and by no means excludes a "step" model wherein episodes of more complex social developments (Middle Chal colithic) may alternate with those of stasis or collapse (Manning, 1993, pp. 39 41; Peltenburg, 1993, pp. 18-20). Erimi Culture to Prehistoric Bronze Age 1: Transition or Disjunction? The change from Chalcolithic to Bronze Age society on Cyprus is not well documented, and forms a topic of serious archaeological dispute (e.g., Eslick et ai, n.d.; Knapp, 1993; Manning, 1993; Monks, 1994; Peltenburg, 1993). Earlier claims for direct continuity between the ECU and the PCU/early Cypriot period (i.e., PreBA 1), for example at Ambelikou Ayios Georghios (Dikaios, 1962, pp. 188-191,200-203; Gjerstad, 1980) were rejected (Peltenburg, 1991c), whilst other sites mentioned in this context?e.g., Philia Drakos "B," Kala vasos Arkhangelos, Vasilia Loukkos Trakhonas, Kyra Alonia?have no unequi vocal ECU/PreBA 1 stratigraphic sequence. Manning (1993, p. 47) suggests that certain sites in the northwest (e.g., Vasilia Alonia and Kladomandra) are "... Late Chalcolithic sites [that] became the new Philia culture sites (contem poraneous with late Chalcolithic sites elsewhere)." "Elsewhere" means the complex of major, southwestern Middle-Late Chalcolithic sites around Lemba and Kissonerga (Herscher, 1980, 1981; Swiny, 1985; Peltenberg, n.d.). Such limitations in the data are offset by ECU and/or PreBA settlement evidence that has emerged over the course of the past 15 years from several sites (see Fig. 12): Kissonerga Mosphilia, Sotira Kaminoudhia, Marki Alonia, Alambra Mouttes, and Episkopi Phaneromeni. As a result, we are at least able to consider issues related to absolute chronology, cultural continuity or discontinuity, for eign contact or intervention, and the emergence of social complexity (e.g., Knapp, 1993, 1994; Manning, 1993; Manning and Swiny, 1994; Monks, 1994; Peltenburg, 1993). Whereas the economy and culture of the PreBA are in several respects direct successors to those of the agriculturally based ECU, the material evidence for the transition between the two periods is somewhat ambiguous. This situation is complicated further by the long-standing debate over the chronological place ment of the PCU: according to Dikaios (1962, pp. 192-203), the PCU preceded the so-called "Early Cypriot" (EC); according to Stewart (1962, pp. 282-285), the PCU was a regional and contemporary variant of the EC (see also Knapp, 1990a, pp. 153-154). Manning (1993, pp. 38-39) recently summarized some of the material relevant to this argument, and with Swiny (Manning and Swiny,</page><page sequence="39">SPreBA SProBA A PreBA/ProBA 00 Mophou Bay "Myr r011 SalamisBay Toumba tou Skouro Messo-ria Plain nkomi Phi ia 9 Nicosia 0 Sinda SAm likou Apliki Etinu 0K AVM"% Marki AhE KallopsidhaN 0 Alambra Kto Twooo Mmws N Hal&amp; Sultan Tekke Mao KissonergaV.

Together these two studies have important ramifications for sort ing out various issues associated with this enigmatic time period, and the cultural sequences within it. It is now reconfirmed, for example, that the traditional pottery/technological phases?late Chalcolithic, Philia, Early Cypriot?are sequential, and actually overlap within the suggested sequence. That is, both the late Chalcolithic and the EC incorporate certain material aspects previously linked exclusively to the PCU. To forestall terminological chaos and at the same time to incorporate the critical new radiocarbon evidence, the final stages of the Late Chalcolithic, the Philia "phase," and the EC I?III periods may all be regarded as PreBA 1, with the understanding that sequential developments can be delineated within this overall period: Late Chalcolithic: ca. 2700/2600-2500 B.C. (as defined by Mosphilia 4 and 5) Philia phase: ca. 2500-2400/2350 B.C. "Early Cypriot": ca. 2400/2350-2000 B.C. I repeat here a notion promulgated above {Terminology and Radiocarbon Time): for those who wish to discuss specific stylistic or morphological devel opments in pottery, the traditional terminology is still of use; the revised ter minology, on the other hand, facilitates discussion of pattern, process, and social action on prehistoric Cyprus. For example, the new radiocarbon dates and a variety of recently published material from Kissonerga Mosphilia 4 and 5 (e.g., storage jars, mortuary goods, a stamp seal, spindle whorls) indicate that this was a transitional Late Chalcolithic/Philia site flourishing from about 2600 2400 B.C.; material from the settlement and tombs at Sotira Kaminoudhia indi cates a two-phase Philia/EC site flourishing from about 2350-2200 B.C. The large (12 hectare) ECU/PreBA 1 site at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Pelten burg et al., 1989; Peltenburg, 1991b) finds no counterparts amongst PreBA I sites (see Fig. 13). In general, PCU sites?only 17 are known (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 150-151, Table 2)?are clustered in the north and northwest, with a few distributed loosely around the Troodos massif (Knapp, 1990a, 154, Fig. 1). In the south, sites such as Sotira Kaminoudhia and Anoyira Trapezi reveal some typological parallels in pottery with the main group of northern PCU sites (Swiny, 1981, pp. 84-85; Manning, 1993, pp. 38-39). With the possible exception of Evdhimou Ambelovounos Swiny, 1981, pp. 72-73) and Kalavasos Pamboules (Todd, 1989, pp. 48-49), no other "Early Cypriot" settlements (or phases within settlements) have been identified. Peltenburg et al. (1987, pp. 15-16) list five "Early/Middle Cypriot" sites in the southwest, to which we might add Psematismenos Trelloukas in the Maroni Valley (Manning, personal commu nication, August 1994). Considering the PreBA as a whole, there is an increase in site size and</page><page sequence="41">Prehistory of Cyprus 417 Size in J Hectares 40 "j 20 0 Sites Fig. 13. Bar chart: Cypriot settlement size in hectares (PreBA2-ProBA).

It is most unlikely that all these "sites" were used or occupied simultaneously. PreBA settlement location was bound up with proximity to arable land and perennial watercourses (Swiny, 1981, pp. 80-81). Recent survey work (e.g., Rupp, 1987a; Sorensen and Rupp, 1993, pp. 3-6; Swiny, 1989; Todd, 1988) has demonstrated an islandwide settlement expansion and an intensification of an earlier tendency toward site clustering in the north west, along the north coast, and around the Troodos-Swiny, 1989). Although incipient exploitation of copper resources had already begun (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 159-160; Swiny, 1986a, p. 67), PreBA society relied on a mixed agropas toral economy. In such a situation, site location near the interface between the agricultural central plain and the mineral-rich foothills of the Troodos is not unexpected; with the exception of the rich cemeteries near the north coast at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (Gjerstad et al.y 1934; Herscher, 1978) and Bellapais</page><page sequence="42">418 Knapp [with Held and Manning] Vounos (Stewart and Stewart, 1950), no PreBA coastal settlements have yet been identified. Recent excavations have uncovered several (circular and subrectangular) structures at Kissonerga Mosphilia 3 and 4 (Peltenburg, 1991b, pp. 21-30); a series of rectilinear, stone-built structures from Sotira Kaminoudhia (Manning and Swiny, 1994, Fig. 5; Swiny, 1989, pp. 18-20, Fig. 2.2a); an unknown number of rectangular, agglomerative "households" along the cliffside at Marki Alonia (Frankel and Webb, 1994, Figs. 1-3); and two "houses," excavated in 1924 at Alambra Mavroyi and Kalopsidha Tsaoudhi Chiftlik (Barlow, 1985; Gjerstad, 1926, pp. 19-37). From the PreBA 2 period, there exists the limited space excavated at Episkopi Phaneromeni, Area G (Carpenter, 1981, pp. 60 63; 1982), and the recently completed field work at Alambra Mouttes (PreBA 2) (Barlow, 1994; Coleman, et ai, n.d.). Excavations at all of these sites have yielded a wealth of economic, demographic, architectural, and metallurgical information that allows a more comprehensive understanding of the cultural and economic transformations that characterized the Prehistoric Bronze Age. The cultural innovations of the PreBA include subrectangular and often multicellular architecture; differential burial practices; the introduction of the plow, cattle, and equids; several distinctive pottery wares (especially Red Pol ished); a variety of mold-cast copper tools, weapons, and ornaments; wider use of spindle whorls and loom weights; gaming stones, and terracotta models. The decline in evidence for deer hunting and the concomitant rise in the importance of cattle reflect a key economic transformation (see Table I), namely the adop tion of the cattle-plow complex and other aspects of the secondary products revolution (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 155-159), which itself facilitated further spec ialized economic developments. For example, the expansion of the agropastoral sector of the economy?indicated by terracotta models of cattle and plow, pottery products associated with the use of milk products, flat copper and imitative groundstone axes for use in forest clearance?helped to support the newly estab lished industrial economy based on the exploitation of major copper ore deposits all along the northern and eastern rim of the Troodos Mountains (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 159-161; 1994, pp. 279-280). The lack of evidence for copper exploitation along the southern Troodos rim, perhaps due in part to the lack of relevant field work, accords well with the observation that the most significant economic and cultural developments of the PreBA occurred in northern and northwestern sites (most recently, Knapp, 1994, pp. 276-282; Manning, 1993, pp. 46-48). Not least important amongst these developments was the likely establish ment of gateway communities?i.e., primary nodes for external trade?along the north coast of Cyprus. Although the actual settlements are still unexcavated, wealthy and abundant burial remains at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba, Bellapais Vounos, and Vasilia Kaphkalla represent the mortuary reflection of the expected urban phenomenon (summarized in Knapp, 1990a, pp. 158-160; Swiny, n.d.).</page><page sequence="43">Prehistory of Cyprus 419 Manning (1993, p. 47) predicts ". . . one or more [socially differentiated] sites and episodes of emergent complexity in the fertile northwest in the Late Chal colithic period," while Peltenburg (1993, p. 20) emphasizes the transformative significance of long-distance contacts ("imported" metal and faience, copper hair rings, um burials, the use of seals) at late Chalcolithic Mosphilia. Control over socially valued materials such as metal goods, and the access to modes of transport (boats, pack animals) that facilitated their distribution or consumption, created the possibility of developing and maintaining asymmetrical social rela tions (similarly, Helms, 1988; Patton, 1991, p. 40). Frankel (1974, 1988) has long maintained that the accumulated evidence can be accommodated within a model of egalitarian social systems, typified by nonspecialist, viri-local (but cf. Sant Cassia, 1985, pp. 180-181), household production, and localized consumption and deposition. Frankel may be correct about a rudimentary differentiation in PreBA social production; however, in his latest published account (1993, p. 70), he allows that major social and economic changes occurred "about 4500 years ago" (i.e., PreBA 1), with the development of larger interaction spheres and new social orientations pursuant upon the emergence of copper-producing activities and the developments associated with the secondary products revolution. The earliest exploitation of Cyprus's sulfide copper ores took place during the PreBA in the northern Troodos foothills (Knapp, 1994, pp. 279-280). As a result, geographic and communication barriers were overcome, and interregional contacts developed. The material evidence for these developments includes increased settlement along the northern Troodos and the north coast; pottery links (stylistic) between the Troodos sites and the coastal site of Lapithos; the prominence of metal artifacts in north coast mortuary contexts; circumstantial evidence for the use of pack animals in the bulk transport of copper to the coast, such as the ceramic model of a donkey with panniers, or the remains of equids and oxen in burials associated with metal goods, terracotta models, and other "prestige goods" (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 159-161; 1994, pp. 278-280, Fig. 9.3; Manning, 1993, p. 49). Virtually all known PreBA imports into Cyprus, from the Aegean, the Levant, and Egypt, have been recovered from four sites on or near the north coast: Vounos, Lapithos, Vasilia Kaphkalla, and Karmi Palealona (full references in Knapp, 1994, 281, Fig. 9.4). That these imports may have carried special significance is suggested by their rarity and perhaps by their desposition in mortuary contexts. Furthermore, the apparent links between cop per production and export, the quantity of metal goods in north coast burials, and the establishment of gateway ports along the north coast, all highlight the economic potential of the north, and are probably indicative of foreign demand as well. The earliest documentary evidence (cuneiform) for the export of Cypriot copper stems from Mari on the Euphrates, and is dated to the subsequent, PreBA 2 period, during the nineteenth century B.C. (Charpin, 1990).</page><page sequence="44">420 Knapp [with Held and Manning] Held (1992a, pp. 138-140) suggests that some level of stimulus (techno logical) diffusion, coupled with low-level immigration from southern Anatolia, may account for both the development of metallurgical technology and the emergence of long-distance trade on an extended scale during the late third millennium B.C. Although there is every reason to believe that contacts with southern Anatolia had been established by this time (e.g., Goldman, 1956, pp. 20-21, 112-113, 128 n. 356, 130; Swiny, 1986b; Mellink, 1991, pp. 170 174), there is as yet no valid reason to ascribe innovations in copper production and distribution solely to foreign expertise or foreign intervention (e.g., Mellink, 1991, p. 167; Watkins, 1973, pp. 146-147). Foreign demand is one thing; invaders from northwest Anatolia (Dikaios, 1962, pp. 202-203), or Anatolian refugees fleeing unsettled conditions in southern Anatolia and taking over Cyprus (Catling, 1971, pp. 808-816; discussed in Peltenburg, 1982, pp. 98-101) are different matters entirely (Eslick et aL, n.d. are reconsidering the entire issue of Anatolian migration into Cyprus at this time). The rapid and intensified development of Cypriot metallurgy during PreBA 1 involved the production of a specialized surplus product, sponsored or promoted by an emergent elite in the context of a prestige-goods economy, and in response to foreign demand (Knapp, 1990a, pp. 161-162; Manning, 1993, pp. 47-48, 51 n. 12; Peltenburg, 1993, p. 20). As the secondary products revolution eased environmental and social con straints, population increased and the trend toward demographic clustering shows a marked differentiation vis-a-vis the northern sites. This distinction must be associated in part with increased copper production and/or the development and expansion of long-distance trade, based on both the bulk transport of copper and the acquisition of imported (prestige?) goods. Even with the obvious changes in social relations that these politicoeconomic developments entailed, until the PreBA (beginning about 1700 B.C.) Cyprus preserved much of its indigenous rural character, with an economy functioning chiefly at the village level. Frankel (1988, pp. 31, 50) has argued for kinship-based household production in the villages of PreBA Cyprus, a situation that would have inhibited the investment of surplus production into social change. Plow agriculture, however, may have led ultimately to shortages of cultivable land (Goody, 1976), whilst the second ary products revolution?reliant on field agriculture and pastoralism?may have prompted changes in the social system. It seems increasingly clear that plow agriculture, the adoption of the sec ondary products "package," and the production of copper as surplus trans formed society in Cyprus's north and northwest, where wealthy burials, prestige goods, luxury imports, and signs of overseas contacts?possibly as part of the emerging eastern Mediterranean "world system" of the mid-late third millen nium B.C. (Sherratt and Sherratt, 1991, pp. 367-368; Frank, 1993, pp. 393 395; Sherratt, 1993)?indicate involvement in a mode of production and an</page><page sequence="45">Prehistory of Cyprus 421 interaction sphere entirely distinct from those that operated contemporaneously elsewhere on the island. Accelerating interregional and overseas communica tions in themselves may have affected the rate of innovation, which would have been increasingly disproportionate between elites and other social groups (Michaels, 1994). In any case, the gap between domestic- or lineage-based production of nonspecialist goods (pottery, clothing, subsistence products) and urban-oriented production of specialist products (copper for export, metals and other prestige goods) increased inexorably through time, as the secondary prod ucts package enabled a new order of magnitude in production, distribution, and consumption. Even though Cyprus never developed the type of palatial economy that characterized the polities of western Asia and the Aegean (Muhly, 1986, pp. 42-43; Held, 1992a, p. 139), some segment of the population had to manage the requirements of specialized production, the subsistence needs of the spe cialists involved in surplus production, the logistics of overseas trade, and the transfer of information within an interregional (if not world-) system. Emergent power groups in north and northwest Cyprus assumed control over the produc tion of staples, prestige goods, and metal resources, established and maintained external trade contacts, exploited external demand, and ultimately sharpened the economic and status divisions within Cypriot society. Although the Prehistoric Bronze Age was a time of disjunctive social change on prehistoric Cyprus, when trade and contact with external groups helped to ameliorate a long-standing resistance to socioeconomic stratification, at the same time this was a transitional era wherein indigenous elites seized the opportunity to formalize, legitimize, and integrate the copper industry that became so critical in the politicoeconomic and urban developments of the Protohistoric Bronze Age. Late Prehistoric Period The Prehistoric Bronze Age (PreBA) and the Emergence of Complex Society The limited evidence for social differentiation during the Chalcolithic period increased substantially during its final stages. Differential burial practices become evident in the variation of tomb types at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Peltenburg, 1985d, pp. 58-61), and in the multiple-burial, extramural chamber tombs at Sotira Kaminoudhia (Swiny, 1985, pp. 122-123). The same two sites also reveal a marked increase in the quantity and quality of grave goods, as do north coast cemeteries at Bellapais Vounous and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (Dikaios, 1940; Herscher, 1978; Keswani, 1989a, pp. 234-236, 507-512; Stewart and Stewart, 1950; Toumazou, 1987, pp. 203-207). Manning (1993, pp. 45, 48) is probably too optimistic, however, when he suggests that the "rich, collective burials'7 of the PreBA 1 period may have been the tombs of elite families or lineages,</page><page sequence="46">422 Knapp [with Held and Manning] an "hereditary aristocracy," and that the luxury goods found predominantly in mortuary contexts represent a "classic instance of a prestige goods economy in action." There is an apparent increase in settlement size from the Chalcolithic period onward (Fig. 13), and an undisputed increase in site numbers (Fig. 14), both of which indicate more than simple population increase (Manning, 1993, pp. 43-44). At Mosphilia, multiple strands of evidence?"birthing" figurines, house models, storage capacity?indicate organized public or ceremonial activity (Pel tenburg, 1991b). Whereas prestige items like picrolite figurines were widely available during the Chalcolithic (Peltenburg, 1991d, pp. 117-118), during the Pre- and ProBA, similar prestige goods?e.g., terracotta models, bronze figu rines, imported goods?had a much more restricted distribution, and were per haps controlled by a specific social group. Similarly, even though PreBA burials at Vounous and Lapithos contained hundreds of utilitarian copper objects (Swiny, 1989, pp. 25-27, Table 2.2), prestigious metal artifacts and imports were more restricted in number (Knapp, 1994, pp. 278-281, Figs. 9.3-9.4). Manning (1993, p. 45) suggests that the ensemble of "serving vessels," particularly those from mortuary contexts, served as containers for alcoholic beverages (see Sher 350.0 50 0-1-,-,-, ERIMI CULTURE PreBA ProBA PERIODS Fig. 14. Bar chart: increase in settlement numbers?Chalcolithic through Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="47">Prehistory of Cyprus 423 ratt, 1987, 1991), themselves made possible only through elite control over various aspects of production. More practical is Peltenburg's recent (1994) ide ological reinterpretation of the "enclosure model" from Vounous as a legiti mizing device underpinning emergent elites who were instrumental in trans forming Cypriot society at the outset of the PreBA. A suite of other factors provides complementary evidence for the emergence of more complex social and economic structures during the PreBA. The increase in site numbers and site size indicates an islandwide settlement expansion. The mixed farming economy became "extensified" (Halstead, 1987; Manning, 1993, p. 44) in the wake of the secondary products revolution and its associated developments (Knapp, 1990a, 1994). If the axe and plow, and the introduction of cattle, altered subsistence production, human interference dramatically altered the island ecosystem. The relations between capital labor and control were reorganized: large tracts of cultivable land, specialized animal husbandry, facil ities for bulk storage, and an increased managerial level over the entire system, promoted an efficient agropastoral economy, served socioideological needs, and provided a surplus that could be mobilized and manipulated by elites. The secondary products revolution made possible the increased agricultural yields necessary for a surplus, as well as the means to transport that surplus. At the same time, the new order of magnitude in agricultural production would have permitted elites to support and sponsor more specialized production activities (Manning, 1993, p. 47). The intensification of copper production and the manufacture of metal arti facts led to the establishment of sites at the agricultural-mineral interface (e.g., Ambelikou Aletri, Marki Alonia), and to an emerging site hierarchy (Webb and Frankel, 1994a; Knapp, n.d.a). The conspicuous metal wealth from the north coast cemeteries, and the more utilitarian copper found both in the north coast sites and in industrial or agricultural villages nearer the copper sources, indicate distinctive attitudes toward metals, and are likewise suggestive of increasing social stratification. In the attempt to document the emergence of social com plexity during the mid-late third millennium B.C., and to engage the landscape of prehistoric Cyprus in a social reconstruction, Manning (1993, p. 45) main tains that the earliest imports into northern Cyprus were prestige goods that served as a likely trigger for increased production. He believes, furthermore, that "an institutionalized, secular form of power [was] concentrated in, or expressed by, a key individual." The exploitation of copper ore-bodies involved ever-more complex organization in both the production and distribution spheres, and necessitated specialized technological skills, the coordination of time and labor, and social realignments that would allow producers, merchants, and con sumers to interact cooperatively or competitively (Coles, 1981, pp. 96-98). The establishment of the copper industry therefore promoted the development of a more stratified social order and the growth of power differentials.</page><page sequence="48">424 Knapp [with Held and Manning] Although the evidence for Cypriot maritime contacts during the PreBA is limited, there is no doubt that the developed economies of the contemporary Levant, the Aegean, and Egypt sought imported goods such as the cedars of Lebanon, the gold of Egypt, and the copper of Cyprus (van Andel and Runnels, 1988). Innovations in transport and technology, such as the longboat and the sail, would have facilitated the bulk transport of raw materials and the exchange of manufactured, prestige goods, on a level unprecedented in the eastern Med iterranean (Sherratt and Sherratt, 1991; Sherratt, 1993; cf. Broodbank, 1989). Accelerated communications as well as seaborne trade between Cyprus and its neighbors propelled many of the innovations and politicoeconomic developments that characterize the PreBA 1 period. By controlling access to copper ores, and perhaps by manipulating the output of dependent smiths or artisans, Cypriot elites consolidated their power base, and excluded other sectors of society from certain metal goods that symbolized elite membership (Morris, 1989, pp. 506 507). In so doing, local groups were able to maintain and even enhance their rank or status (Schortman, 1989, p. 59; Schortman and Urban, 1987). The prestige goods and imports recovered in the north coast cemeteries reveal mate rial affluence and express well the association between wealth and access to resources-in-demand. Although the circulation of most prestige goods was ini tially somewhat circumscribed within society, intensified metallurgical produc tion and distribution through new interaction spheres resulted in a new social dynamic. If the exploitation of copper resources and the early production of metal goods symbolized social differentiation, control over copper production and trade soon led to distinctive politicoeconomic restructuring within society. The need to formalize, legitimize, and integrate the copper industry became a significant factor in the dramatic social, political, and economic developments of the Protohistoric Bronze Age. The Protohistoric Bronze Age (ProBA): Politico-Economic Integration and Dissolution Because contemporary written records from surrounding countries at least refer to Cyprus (Alashiya?s&amp;t Muhly, 1972, 1985a; Knapp, 1979, pp. 151 286; 1985, pp. 234-241), this period is typically regarded as "protohistoric." Within the ProBA, Cyprus's intensive exchange of bulk goods, luxuries, organic products, and raw materials with other, often historically dated cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean (Egypt, the Levant, Minoan Crete, and Helladic Greece) has made it possible to establish a relative chronology with broad temporal controls (see Fig. 1); this chronology, however, has not escaped criticism (Leonard, 1988; Manning, 1995, Appendix 6). The Cypriot material record of the ProBA I phase ("MCIII-LCI") diverges markedly from that of the PreBA, when demographic, economic, and socio political change proceeded much more gradually. During the ProBA, urban</page><page sequence="49">Prehistory of Cyprus 425 centers with public and ceremonial architecture became a common feature of the landscape; hierarchical differentiation in mortuary practices is evident (Kes wani, 1989a, p. 235, 272-286); "Cypro-Minoan" writing (still undeciphered) appeared; the production and export of copper intensified even further; extensive long-distance trade relations developed with other polities in the Mediterranean; fortifications and a relative increase in finds of weaponry indicate a break with past patterns. As demand mounted for Cypriot copper within the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean interaction spheres, elites who controlled copper produc tion and the specialists who carried it out responded to new economic oppor tunities. Such developments are fully apparent in the material goods produced or traded, and are demonstrated by converging streams of archaeological and documentary evidence (Knapp, 1986a, pp. 70-84). Over 300 "Late Cypriot" sites have been identified (Catling, 1962, pp. 160-169; Adovasio etai, 1975, p. 345; Todd, 1989; Sorensen and Rupp, 1993, pp. 6-7; Knapp, n.d.a). Broad horizontal excavations with detailed (albeit dis puted) stratigraphic sequences at several sites have produced a comprehensive material record of ProBA cultural and economic developments. At least four coastal or near-coastal urban polities were established on Cyprus during ProBA I (ca. 1700-1400 B.C.): Enkomi Ayios lakovos, Morphou Toumba tou Skourou, Hala Sultan Tekke Vyzakia, and Kourion Bamboula (Negbi, 1986). In this early phase of the ProBA, at least, site location was associated with proximity either to copper mines or to the seacoast (Portugali and Knapp, 1985, pp. 50-61). At least three other types of settlement characterized the ProBA period in general: (1) inland towns or villages (e.g., Sinda Siri Dash, Pyla Kokkinokremos)', (2) inland "sanctuary" sites (e.g., Athienou Bamboulari tis Koukounninas, Myrtou Pigadhes), and (3) peripheral agricultural villages and copper-mining sites (e.g., Apliki Karamallos, Episkopi Phaneromeni "A"). Centralized production in the coastal ports formed part of an elite strategy to maintain the cooperation of inland centers, agricultural villages and mining sites, and to increase their dependence on specialized goods and services provided by the ruling elite (Kes wani, 1993). The variety and quantity of local and imported pottery, metal goods, and seals in the primary coastal ports, along with dramatic differences in size, distinguish them clearly from sites in the other tiers of the settlement hierarchy (Knapp, n.d.a, Table 2). The rise of urban centers, which controlled at least in part the production and distribution of raw materials and prestige goods, and the existence of lower order sites, is but one of several key factors that must be assessed in considering political and economic development or change during the ProBA. For instance, the limited bioarchaeological evidence available indicates that ovicaprines and cattle continued to be exploited (Table I), whether for their secondary products (Croft, 1989a; Halstead, 1977, pp. 268-269; Knapp, 1994, pp. 283-287; Sher ratt, 1981, pp. 275-283), or for socioideological reasons (Keswani, 1994). The concentration of people in urban centers during the ProBA clearly necessitated</page><page sequence="50">426 Knapp [with Held and Manning] intensified animal exploitation and crop production, but the current archaeolog ical record provides few indicators of this process. Careful excavations have revealed no unexpected components in the agropastoral economy of the ProBA: cereals, pulses, domesticated cattle and ovicaprines; oxen and equids (used as draft and transport animals). The intensification of copper production is seen most clearly in the copper refining installations that developed first (ProBA 1) at Enkomi (Muhly et ai, 1988, pp. 294-295; Muhly, 1989, p. 299), then at Hala Sultan Tekke (Astrom, 1982), and ultimately spread (ProBA 2) to other sites (Stech, 1982; Muhly, 1989; Knapp, 1994). Slag from copper production is ubiquitous at the sites of Hala Sultan Tekke, Enkomi, Kition, and Apliki (Muhly, 1989, pp. 301-302), whilst metal-working installations have been excavated at Enkomi, Kition, Ath eniou, Alassa, and elsewhere. Copper production at major urban sites may have been limited to the secondary refinement of impure chunks of copper (Tylecote, 1971, p. 53; 1985), transported (by pack animals) from the smaller, primary mining and production centers (Stech, 1982, pp. 111-112; 1985, pp. 102-103; Stech et al.% 1985, pp. 398-399; Muhly, 1989, pp. 306-309). Despite this indisputable evidence for intensification, the fact that so few finished oxhide ingots are known from the archaeological record of Cyprus suggests that state controlled copper production and distribution was geared to foreign consump tion. The critical importance to the Cypriot economy of copper for export, and the existence of some centralized authority to regulate that economy, are indi cated by evidence for the smelting or remelting of metallic copper in the major coastal centers (Stech, 1982, pp. 112-113; Budd et ai, 1994), by the near standardized weight, shape, and purity of these ingots, and by the existence of a common system of measurement (Courtois, 1983; Petruso, 1984; Michalili dou, 1990). Demand for Cypriot copper within the eastern Mediterranean interregional trade system impacted significantly on internal developments in copper produc tion (Knapp, 1986b, pp. 42-44). The copper industry, it seems safe to say, propelled Cyprus into the politicoeconomic sphere of the eastern Mediterranean exchange system. At the same time the market potential of Cypriot ports like Enkomi, Hala Sultan Tekke, and Toumba tou Skourou ensured the availability of various domestic products, such as pottery or copper ingots, and of imported goods such as ivory, tin ingots, Aegean and Levantine pottery, and more (Astrom, 1967, pp. 145-146; Holmes, 1975, pp. 94-96; Vermuele and Wol sky, 1990; Portugali and Knapp, 1985, pp. 65-67; Astrom, 1986; Lagarce and Lagarce, 1986, pp. 59-199; Muhly, 1986; Cline, 1994). Mass-produced Cypriot pottery was also exported to the Levant (Artzy, 1985). Close intercultural contact and similar economic functions within the east ern Mediterranean are indicated by the similarities in material culture between the urban centers of the northern Levant?e.g., Ugarit, Ras ibn Hani, Byblos? and their Cypriot counterparts (Knapp, 1986b, pp. 42-44; Knapp and Cherry,</page><page sequence="51">Prehistory of Cyprus 427 1994, 134-142). Cuneiform letters exchanged between the rulers of Cyprus (Alashiya) and Egypt indicate that the Cypriot king (or a Cypriot king?) had extensive authority over the copper industry (Knapp, 1985, pp. 237-239; Moran, 1992, pp. 104-113). This ruler used state agents to conduct foreign trade. The extant documentary record, of course, is far from complete, and provides only a glimpse of the total volume of trade in any given era. Moreover, refinements in our understanding of these often intractable records mean that our conclusions are seldom final (Zaccagnini, 1986, pp. 413-415; 1990, pp. 494-496). None theless, such documents help to reveal the productive output, shipping capacity, and organizational efficiency of a highly specialized, well-coordinated, politi coeconomic system. Cypriot and Mycenaean material recovered over the past decade in the eastern, southern, and central Mediterranean necessitates full reconsideration of earlier ideas about the scope and extent of Mediterranean trade systems (e.g., Lo Schiavo et aL, 1985; Marazzi, 1986, 1988; Bietti Sestieri, 1988; Knapp, 1990b). The Uluburun and Cape Gelidonya wreck deposits (most recently Bass et aL, 1989; Bass, 1986, 1991; Pulak, 1992, 1993) reveal dramatic images of Bronze Age trade in a wide variety of organic (Knapp, 1991; Haldane, 1993) and inorganic goods, and demonstrate a seaborne trade in copper "oxhide" ingots closely linked to coastal or near-coastal sites (Muhly et aL, 1988, p. 281). The central importance of copper production, distribution, and consump tion to the economies of Cyprus, Sardinia, and Crete has been demonstrated by recent isotopic or elemental analyses and their statistical evaluation (Gale, 1991; Gale and Stos-Gale, 1987; Knapp, 1990b; Muhly etaL, 1988; Stos-Gale etaL, 1986). Although lead isotope analysis has played an important role in discussions of the Mediterranean Bronze Age copper trade, its potential and limitations must be recognized (Cherry and Knapp, 1991; Knapp, 1990b; Knapp and Cherry, 1994; Muhly, 1985b). Furthermore, its inability to assign positive provenience, and the problems that arise from the mixing and remelting of metal, have now been demonstrated forcefully (Budd et aL, 1993, 1994). The current archaeological record is heavily skewed toward the later phases of the ProBA. Architecturally differentiated complexes such as the monumental, ashlar-built public or ceremonial structures at Enkomi, Alassa Paleotaverna, Ayios Dhimitrios, Maroni Vournes, Maa Palaeokastro, Kition, and Kouklia Palaepaphos are ProBA 2-3 in date (post-1400 B.C.), even if some had ProBA I precursors (Knapp, 1986b, pp. 38-39; Cadogan, 1992, pp. 51-53). The asso ciation between ceremonial structures and metallurgical installations at Enkomi, Kition, Athienou, and perhaps Kalopsidha Koufos has been discussed elsewhere at length (Knapp, 1986a, pp. 43-56; 1988, pp. 146-148), and their coincidence at Alassa Pano Mandilares and Paleotaverna further demonstrates this pattern (Hadjisavvas, 1989, 1993). Since a number of ProBA 2-3 sites (e.g., Ayios Dhimitrios, Maroni, Kition, Hala Sultan Tekke) reveal evidence for increased copper-ore processing in what seem to be "elite areas," it is likely that local</page><page sequence="52">428 Knapp [with Held and Manning] production managed by local elites had replaced the more centralized production and control of the copper industry at ProBA 1 Enkomi (Muhly et at., 1988, pp. 294-295; Muhly, 1989, p. 299; 1991, pp. 181-182, 184). In other words, an earlier, single, centralized authority at Enkomi eventually fragmented into inde pendent, regional centers at sites such as Ayios Dhimitrios, Alassa, Maroni, Kition, and Kouklia. Because the hinterland supplied raw materials and an agricultural surplus that fueled production in the coastal centers, the integrity of the island system had-to be maintained (Knapp, 1988, p. 151; n.d.a). Emergent elites often seek to anchor their authority by dominating access to exotic goods associated with external ideologies (Earle, 1989, p. 85). On ProBA Cyprus, however, the par aphernalia of power seem to have been essentially local in inspiration and form, even if represented occasionally on "foreign" objects (notably the oxhide ingots portrayed on Mycenaean pottery, Egyptian wall paintings, or western Asiatic cylinder seals; see Knapp, 1988, pp. 145-146). The manipulation of imported or indigenous wealth objects helped Cypriote elite(s) to establish a distinct social identity within the island, and to maintain a high level of international contact (similarly, Eriksen, 1993, p. 140; Keswani, 1993; Schortman, 1989, p. 59). Once an emergent state elite established control over the production and distribution of metals, they adopted new material forms and built new ceremonial structures to engage the population in the changing politicoeconomic system, and to sanction the centralization of authority. If the external economic envi ronment catapulted demand for Cypriot copper within an interregional system, the internal politicoeconomic environment spawned the use of symbols that linked managers and producers, maintained economic integrity on the island, and served to legitimize the sociopolitical status and power of an elite directly linked to the production, transport, and exchange of copper. The ideology sur rounding the centralization and legitimization of authority was most likely anchored originally in strictly emotional and highly charged symbolic appeals (Markides, 1974, p. 24). These legitimizing symbols (e.g., miniature "votive" ingots, bronze figurines and stands, seals) enabled elites to co-opt goods and labor for their own political and economic ends. Mortuary ritual, especially the long-term reuse of tombs throughout the ProBA period, was also used to reaffirm the status of elite corporate groups, and to establish their links with ancestral power groups (Keswani, 1989a, pp. 429, 500-501). During the thirteenth century B.C. (ProBA 2), the prominence of Aegean elements seems to bear witness to an unprecedented increase in Cypriot trade with regions west of Cyprus (Knapp, 1990b; Muhly, 1987; but cf. Cook, 1988). By the end of the thirteenth century B.C., however, a systemwide collapse had affected most of the eastern Mediterranean and adjacent regions (Liverani, 1987; Knapp, 1990b). The breakdown of strongly centralized economies in the eastern Mediterranean about 1200 B.C. was offset by a burst of related activity (Knapp,</page><page sequence="53">Prehistory of Cyprus 429 1986a, pp. 100-114; Rowlands, 1984, pp. 150-152) that had repercussions far beyond the original eastern Mediterranean interaction sphere. The downfall of overspecialized production and trade networks led to the reorganization of cop per production in all sectors of the Mediterranean economy, especially that of Cyprus. This competitive, political and economic "devolution" provoked an increase in the velocity of goods circulated, and an expansion in the boundaries of the interregional system that operated in the Mediterranean. The widespread collapse would obviously have affected external demand (especially for copper), which in turn impacted on Cyprus's settlement hier archy. The same factors that affected the coastal and inland centers would also have disrupted the agricultural and mining or pottery-producing villages, many of which were abandoned about this time. Nonetheless, on a broader scale, the response to "collapse" was to commercialize copper production and distribution in some markets, iron production in others. Susan Sherratt (1992, pp. 326-328; 1994) has argued for strong cultural continuity, even economic and industrial intensification, between ProBA 2 and ProBA 3. The large coastal cities that survived the destructions and abandonments around 1200 B.C.?particularly Enkomi, Kition, and Palaepaphos?perhaps represent the stabilization of author ity at a few key centers. These resilient urban sites would have displaced smaller administrative or ceremonial centers, and managed the new Cypriot contacts that emerged overseas, from the Levant to the central Mediterranean. In con sequence, even as it made tactical and commercial adjustments not just to the collapse but to the coming Age of Iron, the influence of Cyprus's economy remained integral to the Mediterranean interaction sphere. Whether the destructions around 1200 B.C. on Cyprus indicate a return to a more centralized organizational structure (as in ProBA 1), or rather a general pattern of coastal raiding characteristic of eras that enjoy thriving maritime trade, or both, cannot be decided unequivocally on the basis of the current archaeo logical record. By 1100 B.C., however, the settlement patterns and political organization that typified the Bronze Age had come to an end, as new social and economic structures dictated the establishment of new population and power centers on Iron Age Cyprus. The belated reappearance of state-level polities on the island during the eighth century B.C. seems incontestable on archaeological grounds (Rupp, 1987b, 1988, 1989; but cf. Snodgrass, 1988). Such develop ments, however, take us beyond the limits of the present study. PROSPECTS At least three recent studies seek to consider the prospects for Cypriot archaeology into and through the 1990s (Held, 1990; Kingsnorth, 1993; Knapp, 1994, p. 293). Held's study is pointedly concerned with "new directions,"</page><page sequence="54">430 Knapp [with Held and Manning] while that of Kingsnorth deals with the present state of research; my own embry onic notions (written in 1990) are developed more fully in what follows. Other archaeologists would call for different emphases, other prescriptions, alternative archaeologies?this is one of the most sanguine yet predictable points one can make about archaeology in the 1990s (see, for example, Shanks and Hodder, 1994; Knapp, n.d.b). Even if the prehistoric archaeological record cannot serve up meaningful social relationships or gender realities, a readily understandable ideology, or immediately comprehensible production figures, archaeologists can no longer ignore theoretical, methodological, or current political issues that affect archae ological practice and interpretation. If the studies by Held and Kingsnorth deal only in passing with these critical issues, that is more a product of the time in which they were written (Held essentially is promoting a shift to processualism and positivism), or of the issues that they sought to cover (Kingsnorth is eval uating social complexity on Chalcolithic-Bronze Age Cyprus). The culture-historical approach is essential to any branch of archaeology; by itself, however, it leaves much scope for improvement. Rarely have archae ologists working on Cyprus considered the social fabric, economic base, polit ical or religious ideology, much less the mindset?collective or individual?that created, manipulated, and led to the archaeological record available to us today. Social theory, sensu law, defines the actual praxis of most postprocessual or "interpretive" archaeologies, and many archaeologists today do social archae ology (e.g., Redman et aL, 1978; Miller, 1982; Bradley, 1984; Barrett, 1988, 1993; Gosden, 1994, pp. 13-36; Shanks and Hodder, 1994). The most open-minded and forward-looking archaeologists working on Cyprus still reveal some aversion to theory in general (as noted by Kingsnorth, 1993, p. 109), or else still think of social theory, at least with respect to the individual, as paleopsychology?and thus irretrievable (Held, 1990, p. 3). When it comes to the archaeology of gender, despite inauspicious beginnings (outlined by Webb and Frankel, 1994b), certain Cypriot archaeologists have shown keen interest. Granted, in the past much of this work has been limited to the descrip tion and interpretation of female anthropomorphic figurines (e.g., Merrillees, 1988; Goring, 1991; various papers in Vandenabeele and Laffineur, 1991), but work in progress or in press treats a range of relevant topics, including gender bias in Cypriot archaeological practice (Webb and Frankel, 1994b); the archae ology and ethnography of fertility (Bolger, 1992, 1993); female roles and status (Bolger, 1994); and the role of feminist theory in the archaeology of gender (Frankel, 1993b; Knapp, 1995a). Ideology and cognition, like gender, have received much attention in the recent theoretical literature (Demarest and Conrad, 1992; Knapp, 1988, 1995b; Little, 1994, pp. 20-29; Miller and Tilley, 1984; Renfrew, 1985, 1994; Renfrew and Zubrow, 1994). Symbolism, ideology, and representation have already</page><page sequence="55">Prehistory of Cyprus 431 received considerable attention vis-a-vis the Bronze Age Cypriot archaeological record (e.g., Keswani, 1989a, 1989, 1994; Knapp, 1986a, 1988, 1995b; Man ning, 1993; Peltenburg, 1991a, 1994). The pursuit of gender, ideology, and cognition in archaeology should not be regarded as marginal, or as predeter mined by the inherent "nature" of archaeological data. The representations of ancient mentalite exemplify how symbolic and material interests can mesh in an archaeological context that conjoins architecture, ritual imagery, belief sys tem, gender constructs, and social action. The search for all these elements in the archaeological record should be structured by an appropriate theoretical framework, tempered and modified by the analysis and chronological or stylistic ordering of variability in material culture. To achieve this, archaeologists must accept that these more abstract aspects of prehistoric people were not separate and intangible realities, but an integral part of the material factors of everyday life (Barrett, 1991, p. 6). Cypriot archaeology likewise has a responsibility to explore methodologies associated with taphonomy, ethnoarchaeology, locational analysis, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and computer-based mapping, intensive survey, and some of the more abstract concepts associated with the ideational landscape (Knapp, n.d.a). Held (1988; 1990, pp. 10-13, 18-20) has laid out an empirical approach to field survey, sampling strategies, and environmental analyses, many of which have as their ultimate aim the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions and prehistoric landscapes. In addition, he has targeted certain areas that would benefit from further fieldwork. Kingsnorth (1993, pp. 113-116) provides helpful discussions of land-use systems and paleoenvironmental change; when it comes to interpreting the prehistoric land scape, she rightly emphasizes that explanations of social change and adaptation should involve both sociopolitical and ecological approaches. Several method ological trends apparent in recent intensive survey work on the island should help to bring these issues into sharper focus. Intensive field surveys in Cyprus (e.g., Held, 1988; Knapp et al, 1992, 1994; Manning and Con well, 1992) seek to expand the scope of traditional settlement-pattern studies. The Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project (MVASP) incorporates a highly intensive survey of a small, sample portion within a 14.5-km2 area (Manning and Conwell, 1992). Combining geomor phological work with a geomagnetic survey, the MVASP is examining all levels of the settlement system through time; the ultimate goals are to present a data mosaic of human activity and land use in the Maroni Valley. One aspect of the ongoing Australian Cyprus Expedition (ACE) fieldwork at the PreBA site of Marki Alonia was as an "intensive non-judgmental," site-oriented survey in the Alykos River Valley (Frankel and Webb, 1995). In the most recent season (1991) of survey conducted by the Canadian Palaepaphos Survey Project (CPSP) in southwest Cyprus (Rupp et al, 1992, pp. 286-287, Fig. 1), 2.5 km2 were</page><page sequence="56">432 Knapp [with Held and Manning] investigated with a field methodology no less "intensive" than that of the ACE. The Sydney Cyprus Survey Project (SCSP) is conducting a systematic, intensive, stratified archaeological survey in a 14 x 4-km2 area in the north central Troodos foothills, where many of Cyprus's most important copper ore deposits are sit uated in close proximity to the agricultural plain (Knapp et aL, 1992, 1994; Knapp and Johnson, 1993, 1994). The SCSP will use satellite data in combi nation with the project's GIS and geobotanical fieldwork to examine the pos sibilities of site or land-use prediction (Gibbons, 1991; Joyce, 1992). Amongst the several goals of the SCSP, the most important are (1) to reconstruct the landscape of a prehistoric industrial society and to trace its long-term develop ment; (2) to produce rough demographic estimates and assess the likelihood of a proposed settlement hierarchy; and (3) to examine the social and economic impact of mining and to consider its long-term relation to the other forms of production. The MVASP and the SCSP, the CPSP and the ongoing work of the ACE, are attempting to develop the techniques and realize many of the goals associated with an archaeology of landscapes. These intensive survey projects share not only a systemic concern with the ecological and spatial aspects of the landscape, but also a more ideational, historically contingent concern with the social aspects of the total archaeological record. On Cyprus, more generally, it must be said that regional surveys and field excavations could profit from a contextual approach, not just to facilitate functional and distributional analyses, but equally to help us understand how specific artifacts, individual buildings or features, and production debris form part of the overall landscape, and how they may be related in social, ideological, or economic terms to the human actors who inhabit the landscape. Finally, I want to consider certain political issues that affect the study of the past in the present. Archaeologists must consider more carefully how polit ical realities and constrictions impact powerfully not just on our ability to con duct fieldwork, but also on the interpretations that are possible as a result. Whether working in the wilds of Guatemala's Peten jungle, in the steppes of central Asia, in a congested modern suburb of Tel Aviv, or on the outskirts of a small village in the foothills of Cyprus's Troodos Mountains, contemporary archaeologists become personally, professionally, and bureaucratically involved with the townspeople, pastoralists, administrators, and government officials of a modern-day international polity. In such situations, and in the face of such political atrocities as the Gulf War, or the "ethnic cleansing" in what was once Yugoslavia, political neutrality, as Pollock (1992, p. 303) made clear, is no longer defensible. On Cyprus, the Turkish occupation of the northern part of the island, in effect since 1974, shows no signs of abating; this political reality above all others-affects deeply the practice, practicalities, and interpretation of archaeol</page><page sequence="57">Prehistory of Cyprus 433 ogy on the island. The 1974 invasion brought to an abrupt halt every single archaeological field project on the island (Annual Report of the Director of the Department of Antiquities for the Year 1974, pp. 3-6), and no excavation or survey has been conducted in the north since that time. Indeed, it has been difficult for archaeologists of any nationality to gain access to material held in the north, and in many cases the logistics and heat of battle resulted in the destruction of carefully stored material (Vermeule and Wolsky, 1990, pp. 3-6). The list of antiquities that has gone missing since 1974 ranges from Bronze Age pottery (Vermeule, 1974) to Byzantine frescoes or murals, and includes a fortune in Cypriot icons. The former Director of the Cypriot Department of An tiquities, Professor Vassos Karageorghis, repeatedly emphasized how the con tinuing occupation of the north has had a disastrous effect on the island's cultural property, not just as a result of negligence but of vandalism and looting (e.g., Annual Report of the Department of Antiquities for the Year 1980, p. 3; Year 1982, p. 5; Year 1988, pp. 5-6). For example, the Byzantine chapel at Ayias Trias (Monastery of Ayios Chrysostomos) was transformed into a mosque, and its frescoes were whitewashed in the process. Stolen antiquities have been exported illegally and repeatedly, and continue to surface in antiquities' markets abroad. Amongst these acts, none is more outrageous than the "professional" removal of entire frescoes from Byzantine church walls (e.g., at Ayios Solomos and Ayios Nikolaos in the village of Koma tou Yialou), or of the murals from the dome and apse of the Byzantine church of St Theomonianos near the village of Lysi in the occupied sector of the island (Carr and Morollo, 1991, pp. 7 14). And none is more notorious than that of the Kanakaria mosaics, stolen in 1979 but retrieved in 1991 after a celebrated legal battle in the United States between an art dealer and the Cypriot government/church (Annual Report of the Department of Antiquities for the Year 1990, p. 6). This situation perhaps high lights as well as any example, anywhere, how devastating is the effect of col lecting antiquities on a country's cultural heritage (see, e.g., Gill and Chippindale, 1993; Chippindale, 1994, pp. 191-196). These overtly political acts continue to affect the daily life of tens of thou sands of people living in both sectors of the island of Cyprus. The cultural impact will be clear from the foregoing, but the archaeological impact(s) may not be so immediately apparent. Whereas once it was possible to say that, prior to the 1970s, there was a decided geographical imbalance in both survey and excavation toward the northern part of Cyprus (Merrillees, 1985, p. 16), the 20-odd-year military occupation of 40% of the island's landmass has resulted in quite a different situation. The cultural history of prehistoric Cyprus has had to be rewritten entirely as a result of fieldwork and survey now concentrated in the southern part of the island (see especially Cadogan, 1984, 1989; Hadjisav vas, 1989, 1993; Karageorghis and Demas, 1985, 1988; Le Brun, 1986, 1989; Todd, 1987, 1989; Held, 1988; Peltenburg, 1991a; Sorensen and Rupp, 1993;</page><page sequence="58">434 Knapp [with Held and Manning] South et al., 1989). The current situation has not, in fact, simply redressed the imbalance (Rupp, 1987c, p. 2), but instead has created a distinctively southern and western bias. A further result is that virtually all students working on the island today, and many practicing field archaeologists (including the author), have never experienced the archaeological, geophysical, or ethnographic con ditions peculiar to the northern part of Cyprus (Merrillees, 1985, p. 16). On a closely related matter, Held (1990, p. 25) has considered how the prehistoric archaeology of Cyprus may contribute to the cultural heritage and social consciousness of a developing island nation. As is the case with small nations elsewhere, economic conditions favor the conservation and preservation of antiquities (including churches and other built structures), and the develop ment of cultural tourism, as opposed to outright expenditures on new fieldwork. In 1988, for example, nearly 5 million Cypriot pounds were expended on ancient monuments and museums, whereas less than 1 million pounds were spent on excavations, salaries, maintenance, and related costs (Annual Report of the Department of Antiquities for the Year 1988, pp. 64-67). On the other hand, in what can only be deemed a generous, not to mention fiscally strategic policy, for the past 30 years foreign archaeological missions have received a warm welcome and every encouragement from the Cypriot Department of Antiquities. Of course, fieldwork by foreign archaeologists is financed completely from the outside, while virtually all of the antiquities remain within the country. This is now common and appropriate practice in most countries of the Mediterranean. Held (1990, p. 25) may be right in general that "official" attitudes towards archaeology in most developing nations are fostered and dictated by economic conditions as well as by nationalistic feelings amongst their populations. On Cyprus, this attitude has resulted in the ongoing presence of foreign archaeo logical missions, which in many cases (e.g., Vasilikos Valley Project, Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project) have provided the time and labor for rescue or salvage operations. In turn, these foreign teams have been permitted, within the parameters established by the Department of Antiquities, to conduct their fieldwork autonomously. As more Cypriotes become involved in the archaeology of their island nation, however, it is only appropriate that they should become active participants and collaborators in the fieldwork and survey being carried out there. The Association of Cypriot Archaeologists, which pub lishes the journal Archaeologia Cypria, has been actively involved in seeking to ensure native Cypriote participation in all archaeological fieldwork on the island. The establishment of the Archaeological Research Unit in the newly formed University of Cyprus should strengthen this conviction, and foster the education and professional training of younger Cypriotes, who may then take their proper places in managing the cultural resources and archaeological heri tage of the island. Cyprus is a land rich in antiquities of all eras, and the Cyprus Museum?</page><page sequence="59">Prehistory of Cyprus 435 as well as district museums in Larnaca, Limassol, and Paphos (the Famagusta Museum now lies in occupied territory)?has represented a source of national pride and identity to several generations of Cypriotes. The Cyprus Museum in Nicosia, which opened its doors only in 1924 (the first formal "museum" was established in 1888; Karageorghis, 1989, pp. 6-8), is seen as an "archaeological teaching museum," not just a museum of antiquities to impress foreign visitors. Naturally enough, the best examples of Cypriot "art" are on display, but they date from all periods of the island's past, and thus are not designed exclusively to capitalize on cultural tourism. Nor do the displays and special exhibits shy away from presenting the material culture of everyday life, or the more mundane rocks, minerals, waste products, and tools associated with metallurgical pro duction. The Cyprus Museum also houses the Cypriot Department of Antiquities, which is responsible for all archaeological sites, ancient monuments, museums, and field activities on the island. It is also involved in the conservation and restoration of archaeological sites and monuments, and promotes their use for teaching purposes and the development of cultural tourism. Since 1978, and periodically before, the A.G. Leventis Foundation has financed numerous con servation and restoration projects, helped to repatriate antiquities illegally exported and sold on the international antiquities market, and has even con structed a small, underground museum at the Late Bronze Age site of Maa Palaeokastro (Karageorghis, 1990). In all these endeavours, the Cypriot Depart ment of Antiquities and the Leventis Foundation work hand-in-hand. Finally, the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute (CAARI, established in 1979), one of the American Schools of Oriental Research, has provided a major impetus?through its Fulbright and NEH fellowships?for the continuing involvement of U.S. scholars in Cypriot archaeology. Like the Cyprus Museum, the archaeology of Cyprus is a "living orga nism" (Karageorghis, 1989, p. 9) that each year produces thousands of new artifacts, scores of new sites and structures, and an overload of new information. As we move toward an archaeology "beyond 2000," one may be guardedly optimistic about the future of prehistoric archaeology on Cyprus. There are at any given time about 20 foreign teams working on the island; currently 11 of these projects (Astrom, Cadogan, Frankel, Knapp, Le Brun, Manning, Mant zourani, Peltenburg, Rupp, Simmons, Todd and South) have prehistoric and protohistoric components or emphases. The archaeological study of these pre historic "cultures under a bell jar" (Held, 1990, p. 26, after Braudel, 1972, p. 151) would benefit from some modest reorientation toward a more holistic, contextual approach. The traditional strengths of Cypriot archaeology?the orderly excavation, description, and prompt publication of data?should be bol stered more frequently by the use of theoretical frameworks that help to inform our understanding of material data, which itself will provide information to feed</page><page sequence="60">436 Knapp [with Held and Manning] back into the development of a social archaeology. As Held (1990, p. 10) rightly exclaimed, "... to ignore theory and to neglect the non-material dimension of cultural remains is tantamount to practising instinctive archaeology." If we hope to understand human behavior in the guise of material culture, we must accept the role that the latter plays as an active force in constituting the social world. Future work will benefit from more detailed and nuanced empirical analyses of social dynamics, within the context of factors such as subsistence intensification (e.g., the secondary products revolution), technological change (e.g., in pottery or metallurgical production), or the different social and symbolic formations (e.g., gender, ideology, cognition) that make up the behavioral world of pre history. END NOTE In Cypriot archaeology, it is conventional to refer to an archaeological site by using two elements (e.g., Morphou Toumba tou Skourou): the first, non italicized, place name (Morphou) refers to the nearest modern town or village in the territory of which, according to cadastral maps, the site is located. The second, italicized, name (Toumba tou Skourou) refers to the toponym, as known locally or by tradition, nearest to the site (often this is the site itself). After being cited once in their full form, some sites have been here referred to only by the better known of the two elements (e.g., in this case, Toumba tou Skourou, or, in the case of Khirokitia Vouni, simply Khirokitia).
