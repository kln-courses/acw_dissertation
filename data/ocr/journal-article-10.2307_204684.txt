This is a tight, elegant, and superior piece of reasoning. Sheldon Rothblatt University of California, Berkeley The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age. By Harriet Ritvo (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, I987) 347 pp. $25.00 Readers of nineteenth-century natural histories will recognize the Vic- torian moral continuum between humans and other animals that pro- vides the central theme for Ritvo's provocative book. Every manner of beast was endowed with anthropomorphic traits, while unfamiliar va- rieties of humans (lower classes and foreigners) were relegated to a moral level at or below that of the favored quadrupeds. According to Ritvo, the attitudes of middle- and upper-class Victorians toward the animals that they kept as pets, raised on farms, or displayed in zoos symbolized their attitudes toward other classes of humans in their hierarchical so- ciety, and served to reinforce that hierarchy. There is much here to instruct and delight the reader. Ritvo provides a sophisticated, gracefully written account of the multiple roles played by four-footed animals in Victorian England; her narrative is enhanced by nineteenth-century illustrations, many of them amusing to twentieth- century viewers. At its most effective, the book presents sufficient lit- erary evidence to make a compelling case for the symbolic function of animals in Victorian society, as in the chapters on cattle breeding and dog fancying. Aristocratic landowners of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries enthusiastically took up animal husbandry, with the ostensible aim of improving the breeding stock to produce more meat for Britain. They established clubs to sponsor shows of their prize cattle; they com- piled volumes of bovine genealogy that rivaled Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage. The parallel between the four-footed animal and its two- footed owner is unmistakable. "For both animals and people a distin- guished lineage divided those with hereditary claims to high status from arrivistes" (6I). Ironically, these elite breeders had little influence on agricultural production, because they were the only ones who could afford to raise cattle to their own specifications. Moreover, since the principal specifications were massive size and racial purity, the prize cattle were too fat, too clumsy, and too inbred to breed well. Social aspiration is similarly seen as the motive behind the Victorian passion for breeding pet dogs. Ritvo cites descriptive evidence from breeders' handbooks and periodicals to demonstrate that the urban mid-</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 323 die classes used dog fancying to establish identity with the aristocracy and distance from the proletariat. Collies, favored by Queen Victoria, became the most popular of the "aristocratic" breeds, while dogs with- out registered pedigrees were disdained. Even pedigreed dogs owned by commoners were entered in special workingmen's classes at shows. By the close of the nineteenth century, the dog fancy had become an elaborate social institution. Show dogs were ranked according to an arbitrary system of classes and points for each breed, bearing little relationship to biological function. As a result, prize dogs, like prize cattle, were often bred for traits that turned out to be maladaptive and even grotesque. The excesses and ironies of these Victorian phenomena are portayed vividly, as are those of big-game hunting and zoo collecting. The capture of wild animals-dead or alive-is treated, predictably, as a symbol of British imperialism. Ritvo quotes passages from contemporary hunting narratives that reveal more respect for the game animals of Africa or Asia than for the human inhabitants. She illustrates the ungratefulness of those humans toward the British with a delightful artifact confiscated from an Indian potentate: a mechanical model of a tiger eating a Briton, complete with sound effects from both parties (29). Although the book is informative throughout, it is not consistently satisfying as a work of scholarship. Some of the author's assertions about the "rhetorical" functions of quadrupeds in Victorian society are more insistent than her evidence warrants. Ideological explanations are stressed at the expense of others that may be equally valid. In her chapter on rabies control, for example, Ritvo states that, "The public health bureaucracy . . . understood rabies as yet another manifestation of un- settling social forces," and therefore saw the need for rabies control as "persuasive justification for a wide-reaching program of social disci- pline" (170). This social discipline was directed at the poor, whose stray dogs were thought to pose the greatest threat in the spread of the disease. Indeed, stigmatization of the lower classes was a prominent ingredient in contemporary news accounts of rabies, which ascribed guilt and depravity equally to the rabid mongrel and its lower-class owner. But only in a note at the end of the book does Ritvo acknowledge that class prejudice may not have been the only motive for associating rabies with stray dogs. There were sound epidemiological grounds for doing so, since the disease would be expected to spread more rapidly in the freely intermingling population of strays than among the isolated pets of the middle class. The chapters on rabies and on the humane movement would both have benefited from tighter arguments and systematic use of quantitative data. The point of discussing the humane movement in a section entitled "Dangerous Classes" emerges only gradually; the title refers not to the animals, but to the humans who abused them. In the eyes of middle- class reformers, Ritvo explains, cruelty to animals was associated with the unruly and threatening lower classes. The Royal Society for the</page><page sequence="3">324 | GERALD STRAUSS Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) was founded, accordingly, with mixed motives, made explicit by its chairman: not only "to prevent the exercise of cruelty toward animals, but to spread amongst the lower orders of the people ... a degree of moral feeling which would compel them to think and act like those of a superior class" (I35). In most of the legal cases reported by the Society, the prosecuted party belonged to the urban proletariat, typically a cabman or drover. Ritvo cites the percentage of RSPCA reports that dealt with prosecutions of lower-class offenders, but does not supply comparable data on the class breakdown for all such legal actions. Readers trained in biology (such as this one) will notice other flaws. For example, when the author cites the failure of nineteenth-century zoologists to distinguish between "intellectual" and "emotional" com- ponents of animal behavior, she implicitly gives too much credit to twentieth-century science. That distinction is still unclear today. Despite these limitations, Animal Estate provides a fascinating intro- duction to a new interdisciplinary area. It whets the reader's appetite for further, more rigorous analysis of the material. Mary Ella Feinleib Tufts University Emergence of a Bureaucracy: The Florentine Patricians, i530-1790. By R. Burr Litchfield (Princeton, Princeton University Press, I986) 407 pp. $47.50 While reading this solid, deeply researched book, I kept wondering why the story of bureaucracy is always fascinating. Perhaps it is because we see in it a paradigm of the issues of career and livelihood, and of the tensions between private reward and public purpose that shape our own professional lives. Litchfield's volume implies this question more strongly than most works of its kind. The subjects of his study- patrician office holders in Florence during their transition from urban magistrates to functionaries of an absolutist state-are vividly brought to life from the lists and account books through which their changing situation is reconstructed to confront us as individuals adapting, strug- gling, and surviving. Taken all in all, the developments traced in this book are unsurprising. Their interest lies in the precise description that is made possible by the huge surviving documentation of a social group's resourcefulness in adjusting to drastically changing political and social circumstances. Litchfield demonstrates this process in a lucidly written narrative supported by tables pinpointing the fluctuating careers and fortunes of members of 714 noble families whose names can be followed through two and a half centuries of eventful Florentine history. Adaptation is the theme: the skill shown by a cagey business elite in guarding the interests of its class, and in promoting the economic</page></plain_text>
