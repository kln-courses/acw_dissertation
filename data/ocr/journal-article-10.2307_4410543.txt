<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gendering of Early Indian Philosophy A Study of Samkhyakarika Samkhyakarika, a classical Samkhya text, the earliest complete and extant one, upholds a sharp dualism positing two independent realities, 'prakrti', the primordial matter that evolves and creates the colourful world, and 'purusha' the spirit, who is a mere passive observer/witness. The characteristics attributed to prakrti, matter, and purusha, the spirit, are identified with the physical woman and man, respectively. It might also be construed that the constructions of the nature of prakrti and purusha reflected the roles of women and men in early societies. In the first part of this paper the author delineates the dualism of prakrti and purusha as found in the Samkhyakarika, while in the second part is discussed the impact of the same on the constructions of female subjectivity. KANCHANA NATARAJAN Much of Samkhya literature appears to have been lost, and there seems to be no continuity of tradition from ancient times up to the age of the commentators...There is so much that is clothed in a poetic or mystic garb on which commentators do not help us much but which are suggestive enough to tempt us to construct the system anew. The interpretation of all ancient systems requires a constructive effort; but while in the case of some systems where we have a large volume of literature and a continuity of tradition, the construction is mainly of the nature of translation of ideas into modern concepts, here in Samkhya the construction at many places involves supplying of missing links from one's imagination. It is risky work, but unless one does it one cannot be said to understand Samkhya as a philosophy. It is a task that one is obliged to undertake. It is a fascinating task because Samkhya is a bold constructive philosophy. - Krishnachandra Bhattacharyal he present paper introduces the most significant philosophical school of India,2 Samkhya dualism, which tre- mendously influenced pan-Indian culture, religion, art, literature, medicine and also constructions about women and men.3 As mentioned above the Samkhya system has a long history, but much material has been lost, hence it is difficult to trace its begin- nings. The earliest complete and extant text, the Samkhyakarika attributed to Isvarakrshna belongs to the fourth century AD. Prior to this work there are several references to Samkhya in other works like Kautilya's Arthshastra, in pre-Buddhist Upanishads and perhaps earlier too. One finds allusions to Samkhya ideas in the Mokshadharma of Mahabharata, in the Bhagavadgita, the Buddhacharita of Asvaghosa and the oldest Puranas in the context ofcosmogonic speculations. There are also several stages of development of the system from materialistic atheism to dualism to theism. Tracing the long history of Samkhya is beyond the purview of this paper. The focus here is on the classical Samkhya text, the Samkhyakarika. This upholds a sharp dualism positing two inde- pendent realities, 'prakrti', the primordial matter that evolves and creates the colourful world and 'purusha' the spirit, who is a mere passive observer/witness. What de- serves our special attention here is that the characteristics attributed to prakrti, matter, and purusha, the spirit, are identified with the physical woman and man respectively. It might also be construed that the construc- tions of the nature of prakrti and purusha reflected or represented the roles of women and men in early societies. The first section of this paper delineates the dualism of prakrti and purusha as found in the Samkhyakarika while in the second section I briefly discuss the impact of the same on the constructions of female subjectivity. Non-Vedic Origins Samkhya as a metaphysical system ac- cepts the authority of reliable assertions (aptavachana) as an'independent source of knowledge, but makes the Vedas super- fluous by saying that "the saved do not need it, and the unsaved cannot grasp it."4 It relies on reason and observation to deduce its metaphysics. Nevertheless, consistent efforts were being made in the history of Indian philosophy to bring this system of thought under the fold of orthodoxy even though evidence points to its non-Vedic origin. Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty has observed in the context of heresy that "Hinduism has always been noted for its ability to absorb potentially schismatic developments".5 One such effort was made by later philosophers like Madhavacharya and perhaps others earlier than him, to incorporate Samkhya within brahmanical orthodoxy. Origins of Samkhya system are very ancient. Some form of Samkhya philoso- phy can be traced to the early Upanishads like Chandogya and Brhadaranyaka. Pushed further, some traces of proto- Samkhyan trends can be recognised in expressions like 'tamas' and 'salilam' meaning darkness, density and opaque- ness, etc, in the cryptic Nasadiya Sukta of the tenth Mandala of the Rgveda. In fact, Coomaraswamy, the art historian, catalogues the occurrences of all the three terms, sattva, rajas and tamas in the above hymn that later on crop up prolifically in the classical Samkhya philosophy.6 It is highly probable that some elements of proto-Samkhya had their origin in the indigenous non-Vedic cultures. The path breaking work entitled Lokayata by Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya,7 reveals two distinct trends in Indian culture, the Vedic and the non-Vedic, the latter predomi- nantly found in "Tantrism with its supreme emphasis on prakrti or the female prin- ciple" whose influence on Samkhya phi- losophy cannot be underestimated. This discovery debunks the customary domi- nant view that the entire Indian orthodox philosophy has one linear brahmanical/ 1398 Economic and Political Weekly April 28, 2001</page><page sequence="2">Vedic origin.8 Chattopadhayaya9 in Lokayata traces the origin of Samkhya to primitive Tantra, which in turn is traced to the early mother rights. He argues that "because agriculture is the discovery of women and which remains their exclusive preoccupation in its early stages, it created exclusive conditions for the economic and, therefore, also of social supremacy of the female. By contrast, the Vedic ideology was 'purushapradhana' or male domi- nated"10 and the obvious reason for this is that the economic life of the early Vedic peoples was predominantly pastoral "which has a natural tendency towards a social organisation in which males dominate". The fundamental similarity between the three systems of thought, namely, Tantrism, Samkhya and Lokayata or materialism is their common theory of cosmogony ac- cording to which the world is "an effect of the sexual urge and it was born as a result of the union of the male and the female".1 I Classical Samkhya does not emphasise 'sexual urge', nevertheless, evolution is seen as a consequence of union of non- conscious prakrti, gendered feminine and immobile purusha, gendered masculine. Chattopadhyaya is of the opinion that Purusha, the spirit, apart from serving in reproduction/evolution, not only has an anomalous position in mother right but also within Samkhya philosophy.12 The author of the text Samkhyakarika introduces purusha perhaps under Vedantic influence and "did not know what to do with it".13 Another evidence in favour of holding the view that Samkhya originated from the non-Vedic stream of thought is found in Isvarakrshna's ambivalence to the Vedas. For Isvarakrshna, Vedic rituals are incon- sequential for mitigating suffering. What was thought to give a complete relief from suffering is the correct discernment of the difference between prakrti and purusha through a process of serious reflection and contemplation. Verse 2 of Samkhyakarika 4 claims that 'anushravika' (a nameforVedas because it is leart from hearing repeat- edly) has three faults, namely: exaggera- tion, falsity, and impurity. 15 The text states: Scriptural remedies (as for example, the performance of sacred rituals, etc) are like ordinary remedies in the sense that they provide only limited and temporary relief. This is so because the scriptural remedies are connected with impurity ('avishuddhi'), destruction ('kshaya'), and excess or surpassability ('atisaya'). In contrast to this, a better method for the elimination of affliction is available, namely, the dis- criminative understanding of the differ- ence between the manifest ('vyakta'), the unmanifest ('avyakta'), and the absolute knower (jna).16 While trying to locate early Samkhya within non-Vedic Tantra, Chattopadhyaya adopts the strategy of centring prakrti, the feminine and decentring purusha, thereby seeing parallels in early mother rights. However, a similar conclusion about its non-Vedic origins can be reached through another process of pushing the non-con- scious prakrti to the margin and centring the conscious purusha who is striving to attain freedom through renunciation and contemplation as prescribed in ancient ascetic tradition. Mircea Eliade, Johannes Bronkhorst and others17 argue about two distinct sources for Indian asceticism, the Vedic and the non-Vedic. According to Bronkhorst, the Vedic sects practised as- ceticism to attain a more sustaining pleasure of heaven while the non-Vedic ascetics toiled for freedom from pleasures of this world and the heavens. The latter pursued an ultimate emancipation from the cycle of birth and death. Philosophical ideas regarding karma, rebirth and free- dom from rebirth through asceticism were present for a long period and gradually got assimilated in the early Upanishads.18 In this strand of thinking an indissoluble dualism is drawn between the body which is again regarded as part of the world, and the spirit, free from all limitations. The Samkhya model of liberation is suggestive of the non-Vedic, world-denying model of asceticism. This is further clearly evinced in Buddhacharita, the biography of Lord Buddha, written by the brahmin convert Asvaghosa (second century AD), which brings to light the above element of early Samkhyan aspiration to lead a life of recluse. In the episode of the young renunciate Siddhartha meeting with the Samkhyan teacher, Arada Kalama, the aim of Samkhya philosophy is represented as advocating renunciation by turning away the mind of the disciples from samsara or the world. The disciple has to practise over and over again the correct discernment of difference between nature (prakrti) and the subject or knower of the field (kshetrajna), the purusha.19 This ideology of seeking liberation from transmigration is typical of the contemplative ascetic tradition.20 Finally and interestingly, even though doxographers like Madhavacharya (14th Century AD) classify Samkhya as pro- pounded by Isvarakrshna under Vedic brahmanical system, Sankaracharya and Ramanujacharya of the Vedantic tradition were not at all prepared to entertain such a claim. Both the philosophers toil rigor- ously to dispute the view that Samkhya had any Vedic/edantic base.21 For them "the heterodox nature of Samkhya was abso- lute".22 What irked these philosophers the most was the Samkhyan view that matter (prakrti) is the cause of this world and not consciousness or spirit. Samkhya Dualism Materiality 'performs its task', as it were, so that consciousness may have content, and consciousness 'performs its task,' by revealing itself as radically distinct or isolated from all subjective and objective transformations. Because of this associa- tion, the manifest and experiential world has come into being.23 Samkhyakarika Verse 21 Dualism has been an important concept in the history and phenomenology of re- ligion and philosophy. The latter probably has its roots in the former, sharing the same ideas and progressions of thought. Dual- ism can be construed as positing two reals in a relation of difference, dichotomy, or even non-identity, involving a changeable hierarchy. Some forms of dualism may underline obvious differences between the pairs where the pairs constituting the duality may be distinct but not necessarily superior or inferior to one another but harmonious. Anthropological studies suggest that many non-literate societies employ this form. In the early Indian context, the Rgveda con- tains dualities such as darkness/light, dawn/ dusk, man/woman, etc. In such pairs, quite often neither partner is uniformly or system- atically privileged at the cost of the other.24 The fact that such dualities are not hierarchised may give us some indication of the kind of social order which generates and utilises such definitions. Philosophical dualism of the most orthodox kind locates one dual as inferior at the cost of the other which is privileged. In the context of western philosophical history, dichotomous cate- gory of thought can be traced to the begin- nings in ancient Greece. The dichotomies "may be presented by philosophers as logical or theoretical tools, as useful or effective ways of dividing up or under- standing the world".25 There is nothing wrong in seeing the world with these cate- gories of thought, but it may surreptitiously or "covertly promote social and political values by presenting a conceptual division as if it were a factual or natural division".26 Most of the Puranic literature in India pro- motes dualism based on hierarchy in favour Economic and Political Weekly April 28, 2001 1399</page><page sequence="3">of whatever is identified as masculine. The dualism found in the Samkhyakarika is unique in that it neither fits directly into any of the above mentioned categories nor radically'departs from them. Larson therefore gives the nomenclature 'eccentric dual- ism' to indicate 'that the Samkhya dualism does not fit the usual conventional notions of dualism'.27 Samkhya dualism presup- poses the notion of mutual dependence of both the principles on one another at one level and independence at another level. Classical Samkhya categorises the uni- verse into 25 'tattvas' or principles, which are ultimately reduced to two, prakrti and purusha. The two opposite fundamental principles - prakrti, primordial matter and purusha, the conscious spirit - indepen- dent, but eternally coexisting and in some ways codependent on one another, but never at any time fusing into one reality (as Sankara, the advocate of non-dualism would have wanted it) is the foundational theme of Samkhya philosophy. The author of the Samkhyakarika does not view prakrti and purusha as diametri- cally opposed to one another but signifi- cantly juxtaposes their similarities and dissimilarities, thereby escaping the trap of oppositional dualism. There are three verses that describe prakrti and her mani- festations and the purusha. The primordial matter or mulaprakrti is called avyakta or the unmanifest, the world, which has sprung from prakrti is called the manifest or vyakta while the knower and the passive witness of prakrti is the 'Jna' or purusha. Verse 10 of the text28 brings out the dissimilarities between prakrti, the un- manifest and her evolutes, i e, the manifest. In the first half of the verse 11 the simi- larities between prakrti and the world manifest29 is explained and in the second half purusha is described as being similar and also dissimilar to prakrti in some ways. It is noteworthy that in these verses it is prakrti rather than purusha that is the point of comparison. Verse 19 again ascribes certain additional qualities to purusha30 'that can be seen as reverse of prakrti. Following are the tabulations31 on simi- larities and differences between all the three as described in the verses 10, 11 and 19 (Table A). The distinction between prakrti and purusha are as in Table B. Further in the verse 19 the explicit characters of purusha is brought forth as seen in Table C. Isvarakrshna posits two independent principles A and B (prakrti and purusha) and each is seen as sharing certain com- mon traits and also independently possess- ing their own set of features. This depic- tion of prakrti and purusha generally avoids phrasing in terms of A and not A that is so basic to the rules of logic. In case of A and -A, A has attributes while -A is seen to lack them. The two are not seen as lacking in what the other has, but possessing similar and dissimilar charac- teristics. This method is quite notable in Isvarakrshna's description of dualism to keep the duals comfortably apart and alive. Quite remarkably, the author avoids committing the fallacy of transgressing empirical evidence for in the empirical world there are no negatives, all that exists exist positively. Samkhya philosophy makes the dual principle co-dependent on one another from evolution, until the lib- eration of the infinite number of purushas. Considering that purushas are infinite in number prakrti's creative function will also be infinite. Thus the two realities require one another eternally. The assiduous work of prakrti towards purusha's liberation is mentioned in verse 56 where the author says that " the entire effort, though it appears to be for her (prakrti) own benefit, is really for the sake of another, namely, for the sake of the liberation of each consciousness".33 The inherently fecund ('prasavadharmin')34 prakrti is ascribed a grammatical feminine gender and the passive, intelligent purusha, the masculine gender. Prakrti is constituted of three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas.35 The three gunas transform and engender the evolutes including mind, intellect, ego, the five subtle elements36 and of course the gross world. The evolutes are con- tained in a latent form in prakrti. The emphasis here is on interior transforma- tion, and the expulsion of the transformed material, which is closer to feminine pro- cess of procreation. The presence of purusha is as a stimulant, triggering off the process of evolution, which then runs its own course. The imagery of exteriorisation of the latent interior37 is an important metaphor that signifies creation in terms of female conception and parturition. The metaphor of tortoise that extends and withdraws its limbs is given to explain this phenomenon of creation by the commen- tator Vacaspati Misra.38 The fecund prakrti being defined as unintelligent requires the proximity of purusha for stimulating creation. Purusha being immobile and unproductive requires prakrti to create. The text illustrates the relationship through an analogy. Just as an association of a blind man with a lame man is beneficial to both for reaching the destination, so too the blind (unintelligent) prakrti and the lame (immobile) purusha through some form of proximity can start evolution.39 The infinite number of purushas are dependent on prakrti for social and higher spiritual pursuits and prakrti is dependent on purusha for creation. Prakrti supplies through her creative ability the content for purusha's consciousness which in turn purusha uses for knowing that he is radically different from anything that is created by prakrti. The two ontic entities have distinct functions and spheres of operation but are in coordination with one another. From the standpoint of purusha, he is the beneficiary of creation for only through creation he undergoes suffering and seeks release. From the standpoint of prakrti, purusha is required for manifest- ing her potential which is to create. Femininity of Prakrti In my view, there is nothing more sensitive and delicate than primal, creative nature, who, having realised that she has been seen, withdraws and never again comes into the sight of consciousness (that is to say, primordial materiality behaves like a lovely and shy young virgin who, having been seen in her nakedness by a man quickly withdraws from his view)40 - Samkhyakarika verse 61 Derived from the root kri 'action', the word prakrti denotes mobility and fecun- Table A (Manifest) (Prakrti (Spirit) unmanifest) 'Vyakta' 'Avyakta' 'Purusha' Caused uncaused uncaused Destructible eternal eternal Non-pervading pervading pervading Mobile static static Manifold one plural Dependent independent independent Merges back does not merge does not merge With parts without parts without parts Subordinate non-subordinate non-subordinate Table B Prakrti Purusha Made up of three gunas does not have gunas Lacks discrimination possesses discrimination Object never objectifiable, subject/knower General32 individual/specific Non-conscious conscious Productive/fecund unproductive and immobile Table C Purusha Witness Isolated Indifferent Inactive 1400 Economic and Political Weekly April 28, 2001</page><page sequence="4">dity while purusha, etymologically derived from 'puri sayanat'41 or one who is asleep in the body denotes the immobile and non-, active purusha. Chattopadhyaya convinc- ingly argues for the view,42 that the basic philosophical categories of Samkhya were rooted in human analogy and the prakrti and the purusha of the original Samkhya meant the female and the male. He further contends that thc idea of prakrti is not an invention of the early Samkhya philoso- phers but could be traced to very ancient Tantrism where prakrti originally stood for the female principle. The description of prakrti as 'prasavadharmi' (one who gives birth to) in the verse 11 again is similar to the biological fetal development and female conception. The text again compares prakrti to a dancing woman, a nude and bashful maiden who appears before the purusha or the male and disappears. With the term purusha again it is difficult to argue that it did not represent the physical masculine male.Theverses 11 and60almostdeliberately use the terms puman and pumsah that are clearly denotative of the male rather than the formless consciousness. The selection of the Word purusha, puman pumsah for spirit orconsciousness seems more of active choice than mere accident. The Samkhya philosophers surely could have used other words to indicate-the formless conscious- ness if they really wished so. Verses 56-58 from the Samkhyakarika emphasises on an unconscious teleology. Just as' unintelligent milk of the cow nourishes the calf, unintelligent material- ity functions for the sake of the freedom or liberation of purushas. The Samkhya brings in the idea of prakrti evolving for the sake of purusha's benefit thereby making prakrti an unconscious object and purusha the enjoyer of prakrti. Two meta- phors found in the original text that have given the commentators scope for wild speculations are the images of prakrti as a 'nartaki' (female dancer) and the best among the existents, 'sukumarataram'.43 In the hands of commentators prakrti be- comes an enchantress and a seductress, or a bashful virgin, a nude beauty, or even a well-bred lady whose life centres around her male audience, the purusha. The pam- pered, seduced and bewildered purusha enjoys the pleasures offered by prakrti but sooner or later wishes to disentangle him- self seeking higher options like liberation. Prakrti lures, binds and finally releases the purushas. Unlike contemporary smrtis, the Samkhyakarika does not attempt to explic- itly define norms governing gender rela- tions. Rather, it draws on the experiences, perspectives, and attitudes developed by men in a gender stratified society to define women as objects of pleasure and manipu- lation, as a source of bondage from which liberation was essential, and as awesome and fearful in their reproductive role. Thus the system may be viewed as both reflect- ing and reinforcing male perceptions in a gender-stratified situation. These, in turn, are woven into the growth and perpetua- tion of specific ideologies of gender. Social Context It might be interesting to see the social context within which classical Samkhya thought developed. It was obviously embedded in socio-political power struc- tures. Sociological and anthropological investigations may reveal the evolution of the Samkhya system being connected to emerging gender differentiation/stratifica- tion. In many tribal societies, while gender differences exist, these are relatively muted, as men and women share the same space, work, and occasionally have collective rights to resources. As such societies dis- integrate and state/class societies emerge, differences between rulers and ruled and men and women become sharper. As such, men and women may occupy different spaces, use different languages (e g, the Sanskrit/'apabhramsa' dichotomy in San- skrit drama), and have different religious beliefs and practices. More important, creating and/or maintaining differences assumes vital importance. At the same time, men were and are intrinsically bound to women from whom they attempt to distinguish themselves. Hence a variety of means are devised to cope with the situ- ation. The Samkhya tradition evidently represents one such attempt. The anthropomorphic conceptualisations of Samkhya prakrti and purusha have had a considerable impact on the construction of female and male subjectivities in later theological, social, medical, legal and other discourses. Attribution of grammatical gender to the function of prakrti and purusha, and blurring the differences between the actual and the social woman and prakrti on the one hand and physical man and purusha on the other led to some serious consequences. It is undeniable that Samkhyakarika and its several commen- tators have identified women too much with prakrti and thus the role assigned to prakrti became the paradigmatic model of the role that women were supposed to play in the spiritual seeking of man. According to the contemporary philosopher Daya Krishna the strange naming of the prin- ciple of consciouness as purusha and not chit, facilitated it to think of prakrti, the principle opposed to it, as feminine in character. "The contrast between purusha and prakrti is thus transposed into the contrast between the masculine and the feminine principle in reality".44 The ascriptions of grammatical gender orders enhance the blurring of prakrti with the physical woman and purusha with the male. Even though Sanskrit is a highly gendered language it is hard to delink the grammatical and semantical orders in many cases. Sally Sutherland, a noted scholar in Indian religion has demonstrated in the context of her study on the Vedic suktas on 'vac',45 how gender and language are closely linked in traditional south Asia. Quite significantly she observes that al- though grammatical gender may not nec- essarily point to the semantic gender, and therefore ultimately to the social, but at- testations to a semantic gendering in the context of some words with reference to the observable social contexts could be well identified. This insight is quite useful for Samkhya studies where many qualities attributed to prakrti like inability to take decisions, exercising an influence on purusha's liberation, "luring and binding purusha", etc, are directly transferred on to women and a kind of ambivalence centring around women became marked. In the following section we discuss is undertaken on the problem of identifying woman with samsara or the world ('vyakta') and defining the release of purusha or the human male in terms of release from her capricious and binding tendencies. Corporeality and Liberation May I never, never, enter that reddish- white, toothless, slippery and slimy (yoni) of the woman.46 Chandogyopanisad VIII, 14.1 All women are sprung from Prakrti The best, the worst and the intermediate, The best are derived from the sattva portion, They are well-mannered and chaste, The intermediate are parts of rajas, Seeking pleasure and ever intent on their own ends, The worst are parts of tamas, of unknown ancestry, Bad mouthed, unchaste, licentious, inde- pendent, fond of quarrel, Unchaste women on earth and the heavenly nymphs Are known as prostitutes, and are parts of tamas. - Brahma Vaivarta Purana47 Economic and Political Weekly April 28, 2001 1401</page><page sequence="5">Even though, according to the Samkhyakarika, theoretically speaking, every human being, male or female and in fact all living beings possess conscious- ness or purusha, and every corporeal body encasing the purusha is constituted of prakrti's evolutes, it is the human woman who is totally identified with prakrti. In social contexts her physical body is not distinguished from the spirit or purusha which is supposed to uniformly reside within all living beings:In other words the focus seems to be just on her corporeality. Fated thus, the woman is not only seen as unfit for higher pursuits, but also worse, she is seen to impede the spiritual progress of men. Hence renunciation of women which became equivalent to renunciation of samsara or prakrti was strongly enjoined for those who chose the ascetic path. The parallel options of giving up contact with men and retiring from samsara were not available to the woman. That some women circumvented these obstacles and took to the ascetic path is however noteworthy. Men, though not often, exercised the option of abandoning the household in pursuit of higher knowledge that would lead to Kaivalya. The 'eccentric' dualism of Isvarakrshna was transformed into orthodox and rigid dualism in the hands of commentators and law-givers. While immortality, spirit, transcendence ahd free- dom/liberation were viewed as sacred and male, the opposites were seen as profane and female. Also liberation through dis- crimination and transcendence of the spirit from corporeality necessarily implies a misogynist construction of the female body and sexuality. According to the several commentators of the text, the seeker of the higher pursuit is always the male who has to turn away from woman and her allure- ments. The path prescribed in this form of asceticism is renouncing the world that is constitutive of wives and sons. Two im- portant commentaries called Mataravrtti48 and Paramartha's Chinese commentary49 on Samkhyakarika contain an arresting prolegomena on the origin of Kapila's Samkhya system which reveals the fusion of women with family and house. Samkhyakarika itself does not relate this story which is as follows: Once upon a time, the compassionate sage Kapila, greatly perturbed by men immersed in darkness and ignorance, went out look- ing for an eligible student who could be instructed on the supreme wisdom of Samkhya. After a prolonged search, he came across a brahmin ritualist of one Asuri lineage leading a content house- holder's life. Kapila, with the intention of weaning him away from the household way of life asked him: "Hey Asuri! Do you delight in being a householder?" Asuri replied "I do Sir". Kapila left him and returned after a thou- sand years, repeated the same question at Asuri who gave the same complacent reply. The undaunted Kapila arrived the third time after another thousand years and asked Asuri if he still relished the householder's life. This time Asuri replied: "No my Lord, I do not enjoy this anymore" The triumphant Kapila then enquired from him if he would quit the householder's life and follow him to live a life of celibacy and learn the ways of exterminating suf- fering. Asuri readily agreed to this and gave up his wife, sons etc. Thus Asuri became a beloved disciple of Kapila.50 Thus the narrative offers a discourse wherein suffering is seen as arising from household which is strengthened by wife and sons. As objects of sexual desires, prakrti and women are seen as "obstacles in the celibate path of male renunciates, sensual stumbling blocks to be avoided"51 Sankaracharya' s commentary on the above quoted verse on Chandogya Upanishad explicitly warns the spiritual aspirants (always males) that the brilliance, strength, vigour, knowledge and righteousness will all be destroyed if they were to betake themselves to the toothless (eating even though toothless),the reddish hued, slip- pery vagina of a woman.52 It must however be remarked that in the above story of Kapila and Asuri, the former had to wait for 3,000 long years before Asuri decided to leave the household. This may be in- dicative of the truth that people were not really inclined to undertake the torturous ascetic path or celibacy despite strong prescriptions around them. A final remark on the passage quoted from the Brahma Vaivarta Purana in the beginning of this section. This Purana is a recent work specific to Bengal which has produced a large number of secondary works in Bengali on Samkhya system during the colonial and early post-colonial periods. Brahma Vaivarta Purana states that all women spring from prakrti. Prakrti is made up three gunas or strands and so are women. Sexuality of women seems to be the crucial concern in categorising women into three groups. Sexuality well guarded by males is the best category, while women seeking sexual pleasures belong to the mediocre category, and totally licentious and independent women belong to the worst category. Furthermore they are bad mouthed and quarrelsome reinforcing the male ste- reotypical notion about woman's sexual appetite and her unguarded tongue.[ili Notes [I am greatly indebted to Kumkum Roy for rendering invaluable and generous help towards the writing this paper.

The volume includes a lengthy and scholarly introduction on the history and philosophy of Samkhya and the summaries in English of all extant Sanskrit texts of the Samkhya system. It is not that the summaries are without flaw, many of them delete important analogies and metaphors used by various commentators.

A classic example of the induction of such Hindutva politics into the academic world, lacking in any critical perspective, is a recent publication entitled Facets of Indian Philosophical Thought, (Vidyanidhi Prakashan, 1999) by a faculty member of the Department of Philosophy of Delhi University, Shashi Prabha Kumar. Her writings mirror such a trend. According to her 'The identity of Indian Culture is to be determined on the basis of elements derived from Vedantic thought since the cultural foundations of India are rooted primarily in these ancient monuments." pp70-83. Incidentally the entire book abounds in such preposterous statements.

"The khasis have a regular mythology according to which the universe has been produced from the Supreme Being U Blei Nongthew, God the creator. But he is represented by a goddess Ka Blei Synshar probably owing to the influence of matria potestus on their social life. This materia potestus mnay have some bearing on the Samkhya Philosophy in which prakrti is conceived as the primordial matter and also as the all pervading Female principle and purusha conceived as Male Principle and the creation of the universe proceeds from the union of these two principles. But the position of the purusha as the Male Principle is highly anomalous in the Samkhya. It is indifferent, inactive, subordinate and nothing but a passive spectator.The origin of the anomalous position of the purusha in the Samkhya may thus presumably be traced to the anomalous position of males in a matriarchal society in which the mother is the head and the only bond of union of the family, the father or the husband being no more than a guest to his wife's people. He is looked upon merely as a begetter (U Shong Ka) and can take no part in the rites and ceremonies of the wife's family. That is why he is bound to be inactive, indifferent, and passive spectator, exactly like the purusha of the Samkhya."

So also is prakrti. The purusha is the reverse of that, as well as similar. Verse 11. 30 "Finally, bacause consciouness is the reverse of that which has the three constituents (three gunas), it follows that consciouness can be characterised as that which is the basis for there being a witness, as that which is 'isolation' or liberation; as that which is the basis for there being a witness, as that which is the condition of neutrality (or, in other words, the condition of being separate from all specific experience); and as that which is the condition of non- agency."

I have used Sharma's tabulation method. 32 Major commentators like Matara, Gaudapada and Vacaspati Misra on Samkhyakarika have given the example of ganika or a harlot and nartaki a female-dancer to explain the term samanya or common. It is interesting to note that the commentators at no point miss the chance of comparing prakrti and its attributes to a woman. 33 Translation and summary, Karl Potter and G Larson, p 161. 34 According to the Tamil lexicon the word, 'prasava' means parturition, childbirth. Tamil Lexicon, Vol V, University of Madras, 1932, p 2670. The spoken Tamil quite often uses the term prasava for childbirth. 35 The term guna in Samkhya is used in a technical sense. Guna is a constituent strand of primordial materiality. According to Samkhya the gunas can be described with reference to objectivity as well as subjectivity. From an objective perspective, the gunas are referred to as ,a "continuing flow of primal material energy that is capable of spontaneous activity (rajas), rational ordering (sattva), and determinative formulation or gross objectification (tamas)". From a subjective view, guna is a "continuing flow of experience that is pre-reflective, spontaneous desiring or longing (rajas), reflective discernment (sattva), and continuing awareness of an opaque, enveloping world (tamas)". Guna in Samkhya also has a implications of moral distinctions in that satisfaction is referred to as originating from sattva, frustration from rajas and confusion from tamas. Summary from the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Vol VI, pp 65-70. 36 The five subtle bhutas are the sound, touch, form, taste and smell elements which in turn evolve into five gross elements, ether, air, fire, water and earth respectively. 37 Laurie Patton observes the strong presence of an imagery of the exteriorisation of the latent interior throughout the larger structure of the Vedic hymn to Vac. This is an useful imagery to express female biological process of reproduction.

Sukumarataram or literally means the 'best among the kumaras' and it is used by the author to glorify prakrti for her liberating role. But Vacaspati Misra atributes the meaning 'modesty' and explains it as follows: By modesty here is meant extreme delicacy of manners, the unbearability to suffer exposure to the purusha's view. If a well-bred lady who is not to be seen even by the sun, with her eyes cast down, happen to have her body uncovered by chance and thus seen by a stranger, she tries to hide herself in such a way as not to be seen again; so Nature also- even more modest than such a well-bred lady- having once been seen by the purusha will in no case show herself again."

Asuri continues to proclaim that he is happy with his life even the third time when Kapila asks him "Can't thou maintain thyself pure and live the life of a brahmacharin?" Accepting the challenge, Asuri replies "I can". Thenceforward he renounced the way of his family and commenced the ascetic observances, as Kapila's disciple.
