<plain_text><page sequence="1">polygram/i PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN TRANSLATIONS by Richmond Lattimore, H?lderlin, Ettore Romagnoli, and August Boeckh COMMENTS by James Hynd, Christopher Middleton, and D.S.Carne-Ross Writing of R. P. Blackmur, John Crowe Ransom once remarked on the way that critic could "keep talking, keep pointing, till the poem is overwhelmingly actual in the reader s consciousness." To make the poem "actuar is presumably what most good critics in England and America try to do, and when the poem is in English or even in a modern European language, there is no particular problem. Effective criticism of classical literature is more diffi cult. The critic may quote the poem in the original, but he cannot be sure how many of his readers do in fact know Greek and Latin ?nor how well they know Greek and Latin. (Well enough to catch the nuances? Or merely to get the general sense?) He will prob ably add, for everybody's convenience, a translation, in which case there may be a serious confusion. The critic, presumably, is talk ing about the original, yet he knows that some of his readers must depend on the translation. In the effort to avoid this confusion?which makes any respon sible criticism impossible?we are publishing in Arion a series of composite articles ("polygrams") dealing with specific Greek or Latin texts. The text will be given in the original (and printed, for ease of reference, on a fold-out attached to the inside back cover) and will be accompanied by a number of translations, each translation, in turn, followed by a comment which will seek to establish its relation to the original. A two-way motion, then: from the text to the translation, and back to the text. We hope in this way to assert the absolute primacy of the origi nal and also to accept, without equivocation, the role that trans lation plays, and must play, in our study of Greek and Latin literature. (Every time we read an ancient poem we silently translate it, either into our own language or into our own struc tures of thought and feeling. A written translation makes this process explicit.) Two complementary propositions are at work: 1. The inevitable inadequacy of all translation sends us back to the original. 2. The original must be mediated by good translation if it is to live within our culture.

He has beaten Hellas at the art that once Pallas Athene found when she followed in song the death dirge of the bitter Gorgons. She heard that melody in the agony of their sorrow, dripping down from the forbidding, snake-locked heads of the 10 maidens, after Perseus slew one of the three sisters and brought home death to the people of Seriphos by the sea. Surely he blinded the strange race of Phorkos and made a bitterness of the feast of Polydektes, and his mothers long slavery and her bed of necessity, 15 by drawing forth the head of lovely Medusa, he, Dana?'s son, who, I affirm, was born of the raining gold. The maiden goddess, when she had saved her friend from distress, discovered the polyphonal music of flutes, with instruments to mimic the wailing clamor 20 that grew from the mouthing jaws of Euryala. The goddess found it and, finding, gave it to mortals to use, naming it the melody many-headed, splendid herald of rivalries to rouse people, rippling forth from the thin bronze bound on reeds 25 Reprinted from The Odes of Pindar, translated by Richmond Latti more, by permission of The University of Chicago Press.

Success for men, if it comes ever, comes not unattended with difficulty. A god can end it, even today. That which is fated you cannot escape. But a 30 time will come such that it will strike in amazement beyond expectation, to give one thing desired, to withhold another. James Hynd First issued complete in 1947, and one of the earliest of his classical works, Richmond Lattimore's Pindar now sits on the shelf beside his Homer, Hesiod, and Aeschylus: the standard version for our time. It has pictures, pretty passages? "Akragas / where the sheep wander, the templed hilT? which would hardly have survived a more recent recension. But metrically it is just as puzzling as his other translations. Pindar's strophes, after all, are identical, line by line, in a way that even Homeric hexameters are not. Try counting the syl lables, though, or testing the rhythmic appeal, of, say, each third line here. And yet there are eight lines to a strophe in Lattimore as in Pindar. Double-talk? It is the air of antic gravity that confuses one. But the test is elsewhere. To move within the great mov ing form, the strophe four times repeated, and study the quick life of words. One glances around first just to check, pace Professor Lattimore's famous accuracy, that everything is in order. There are some surprises. "Beloved brightness," says Lattimore, where Pindar seems to say 1over-of-bright ness." And so it goes on: Lattimore Pindar (?) 1 loveliest of the cities 1 loveliest of mortal cities of mortals 7 followed in song 8 wove through 8 death dirge deadly dirge bitter Gorgons 7 insolent Gorgons</page><page sequence="5">Richmond Lattimore 237 Lattimore Pindar (?) 12 by the sea 12 in the sea 17 raining gold 17 self-flowing gold 19 polyphonal music 19 the omni-sonal music of flutes of flutes 21 grew 21 approached 25 rippling forth 25 proceeding through 27 Kephisos 27 daughter of Kephisos Not important, perhaps; though one's expectations are shaken. But these are particulars that may have a place in Lattimore s scheme of things. Even the best-informed reader is forced to construct, or reconstruct, the original; for we are all, to some degree, ourselves translators. It seems the fairest procedure to let the poem emerge in full (as it does, or as far as it will for us) from its opening strophe, and to let Professor Lattimore move along beside it. 1. Beloved brightness: the Greek "lover-of-brightness." This brightness is a transfiguring light that touches mortals, in a victory. In the Greek, the poem opens with the words of ap peal, the words that call attention?at once less strained and more compelling than Lattimore's "I beseech you," some thing, perhaps, between "request" and "require"?and con tinues immediately with the words 'lover-of-brightness, most beautiful of mortal cities." It is a compelling delight in grace (and grace has touched Akragas in touching the man, Mi das) mat renders her most beautiful. The words have a se mantic efficiency that is typical of Pindar and equally at odds with the "fine frenzy" of tradition and with Pound's "big rhetorical drum." 2. house of Persephone: literally, "seat, dwelling place of Persephone." It is clear enough in the Greek that the City Nymph is being addressed. like the city and the river that runs by it, she is called Akragas. But it makes for a puzzle in the English when one at last reaches "lady" (3). Pindaric usage would allow one to take "dwelling place of Perse phone" as a further attribute to the City-Nymph, the strain of moving from person to place eased by association, mortals</page><page sequence="6">238 polygram / 1: pindar's twelfth pythian Persephone, cities-dwelling place. Equally, perhaps, the phrase has shifted back for just this reason from dependence on the same verb of "dwelling" that governs "the templed hill." As the scholiast remarks, it is Sicily as a whole that is the "dwelling place of Persephone"; and it would be quite in Pindar s manner, and permitted, I think, by hyperbatic syn tax,1 to move from the island of the great goddess to the sharp local scene, just as before he had moved from the whole world of mortal cities to the island of the Goddess of Death. Persephone contrasted with the splendor in which Akragas delights. 4. in the kindness of men and immortals likewise: With its vague resemblance to something that is not English, the phrase is characteristic of Lattimore's translation. In Greek, the words "of immortals, of men" follow directly the attribute, the wish, "gracious"; next comes the connective particle, then the preposition, which means "with," and lastly the com pound word eumeni?, something like "good will." The com plex thought of the opening lines is developed further. The City-Nymph ("o lady") whose identification drew the poet into the poem begins to act within the poem. Seen logically, "she" is a mediating symbol, between divine and mortal; and the poet supports the argument in three successive lines by an etymological element, lost in Lattimore's translation. A "fine" response (eu-meni?i, 4) is called for by her "fine" position (she inhabits a hill of eminent buildings, a "high palace hall," eu-dm?ton kol?n?n, 3) and by the "fine" fame of the victor (eu-dax?i Mid?i, 5). Interest as well as logical propriety is at stake; and with the hill, site of communication between heaven and earth, the poet touches a more ancient propriety. He moves through the symbol toward the heart of myth, the place of vivid connection. "Of immortals, of men"; and their united good will is a presence that attends the gracious City-Nymph, not a vague adverbial phrase. The deepest life of anthropomorphic myth is in it. It is through the Person that the poet reaches the source?not by any simple leap of imagination, however, but by the close work ings of intelligence. It may surprise some people that Pindar 1 Compare, for example, line 9 and the position of re.</page><page sequence="7">Richmond Lattimore 239 should also be intelligent. There is no sign of it, for instance, in Professor Lattimore's translation. No sign, either, of the clarity of that intelligence. That good will is there, in Pindar, means that resentment is not or should no longer be there. Success, the moment of light, is not a simple advantage. Intelligence must acknowledge the forces of darkness, but equally it refuses to diminish joy. Most profoundly, it sees in their coexistence the occasion of form, the occasion of the poem. So when Pindar asks the City-Nymph to accept "this garland," he refers not only to the Delphic prize but to the poem itself, as that act of celebration which is also the act of mediation. For, as we have seen, the poem grows from the poet's effort to relate, to reach the heart of the Person ad dressed, the living center. The encounter has its danger, for the poet has himself accepted the victor s success?"accept . . . this garland f or . . . Midas / accept him also." But the poet is the person who can reconcile the danger and the success, in the poem. The poem is "about" the dark and what may be won from it?though "about" fails to communicate the growth of form: the way the myth itself emerges from the occasion of the victory; the way the final gnomic passage emerges from the myth as the abstract signature of form. The movement of creative intelligence. 7-8. The Greek frames the lines between the two names of the goddess, "Pallas . . . Athene," an effect of containment difficult to get in English (though H?lderlin gets it in Ger man ). Lattimore s balancing of "Pallas Athene" by "Gorgons" is rather different. But he does catch the repetitions of "found," here and in line 23, an important index of ring structure: And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. The mode of thought is coordinate with that animation of the symbol which, through relation to Akragas, draws the poet into the poem to reach finally, in his homeland, the Graces' Orkhomenos, the place of vivid connection. Such patterns of expectance are ultimately matters of syntax. like the strophic form, they confirm a world of discourse, in which</page><page sequence="8">24O POLYGRAM / l: PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN the famous Pindaric willfulness is function and measure of the given. Similarly, in the presentation of myth the Pindaric manner is allusive: "to elaborate a few things in matters that are extensive, for those that have ears to hear" ( Pythian 9.77-78 ). The given is stressed by a touch. The word "insolent" of the Gorgons (7); the word "lovely-cheeked" (not Lattimore's blurred "lovely") of Medusa (16).2 As the scholiast re marks, the poet calls Medusa "lovely-cheeked" not because she was so (though that is a failure in his imagination), but because she was vain and contended in beauty with Athene. Another touch in the phrase "and rendered bitter for Polydektes that contribution-feast" (14); and again the scholiast helps. At a feast where each brought a share, Poly dektes of Seriphos demanded that Perseus bring him the Gorgon's head. (Perseus gone, he could freely possess the youth's mother. ) Crise dhonneur, and the difficulty of the task. But the hero had the favor of Athene ( 18 ). Athene's resentment, Athene's favor (we feel the poem grow from that opening appeal), and the hero's trouble. Medusa's sisters pursued him as far as Boeotia, the scholiast tells us. And there grow the reeds that are used in flutes. After she had rescued him, the poem says, the goddess set to inventing the flute, in order to mimic the wail that had ap proached from the Gorgons. Watch them, as far as they can be confronted: girls' heads and snakes* heads, unapproach able ( Pindar 9, Lattimore 10 ) ; their lament a strange kind of libation (P.10, L.9-10); the jaws (of the girls? of the snakes?) eager-to-snatch and the shrill wailing (hissing?) drawing near ( 20-21 )?deadly in itself ( 8 ). The hero is already saved. How, we need not know. A greater design is being worked, from what might have been the due apotropaic response. Pensive fingers bind reeds and bronze together (21, 25), by weaving, as it were, out of the physical "weaving-through" of the elements the one many voiced tune. It is an invention for mortals, and the great act of naming follows: "the nomos of / over many heads." Nomos means technically a nome, a genre of music, but more deeply, 2 The Greek is eu-paraou, a further resonance of the opening etymo logical argument, and grimly reversed in the snatching jaws of her sisters.</page><page sequence="9">Richmond Lattimore 241 order. Pindar has drawn out the common name of the tune, "many-headed nome" (in playing which Midas had won his victory) ; but his elegant variation, as usual, attests a nurpose. Most of this is lost in Lattimore's translation. He fails equally to convey the just wit of Perseus' achievement. The Greek says "he completed to perfection the third part of the sisters, to sea-girt Seriphos and its people bringing the share [that was their due]" (11-12). The words "part" and "share" are etymologically connected: "third part" means "most choice part" and "share [that was their due]" means both his contribution to the feast and, another sense of the word, their death. Both Seriphos and its people were petrified into a rock of strange formation in the sea. Then the weird wit of the whole exploit is pronounced (?toi, 13?Lattimore's "surely" gives no hint of what is happening) in the first adventure and the last event. Perseus had to learn the home of the Gorgons from their sisters the Graiai, by snatching from them, for all their oracular powers (that is the point of the word Lattimore translates as "strange"), the one eye that they all shared. (There is a kind of punning in the words meros, "third part," moiran, "share [that was their due]," and even amaur?sen, "baffled, blinded," occurring toward the end of successive lines, 11-13.) He made that famous feast bitter to Polydektes ( a name which means "re ceiver of much" and is used elsewhere of Hades), and bitter, too, the slavery and intercourse forced on his mother. The strophe closes not, I think, with merely the display of Me dusa's head but with the act of cutting it (the Greek offers both senses) which made his revenge possible?the swift account of his adventures returning, in typical ring form, to the critical act with which it started ( 11 ). Syntactically, though, the strophe passes into the next. His mother was Dana?, his father "self-flowing gold." The ap parition has the more import as it suspends causation. More is meant than meets the eye. Behind, within, the numinous puns, the young hero's success and rescue, behind Athene's favor, her gift to men of the nomos that constrains the mon ster, is the baffling presence of Zeus himself. A quick flash, and he is gone: to reappear, as at the opening of the poem, for the "lover-of-brightness," so at the end of the poem: "if there is any olbos [a rich word?"splendid gain"] among</page><page sequence="10">242 POLYGRAM / i: PINDARS TWELFTH PYTHIAN men, without effort / it does not appear [does not shine forth]" (28). Lattimore's "success" is too opaque a word, though he suggests, unintentionally, the way in which the phrase "without struggle" corresponds exactly to the phrase "with good wilT in the opening strophe. Pindar remains in telligent to the end. But that visitation, hardly predictable, though inevitable when it comes, leaves its mark, a means to order. The nome that recalls struggle, that draws the peoples together in civi lized contest, is a dynamic principle of organization. Effort remains; and its tune makes (weaves?) its way through (Lattimore's "rippling," 25, is not a good idea) a thin band of bronze and the reeds that it binds. Art and nature. There is a still profounder vision. The home of the reeds is the sacred precinct of Kephisos* daugjhter, near Orkho menos, a city whose beauty is in its dancing grounds, the city of the Graces. And there the reeds are the constant justifiers of the dance, keeping time in eternal attendance?reeds at once and flutes. This sure vision of the poet's homeland corresponds to the opening appeal to Akragas ( a point stressed by the repetition of the word "to dwell," 3,26, missed in the translation). Kin ship of interest, xeni?,3 is established; the movement is over; the poet stands in the place of vivid connection. Here experi ence is knowledge. Tlie signature of form comes clear of process: "if there is any splendid gain among men, without effort / it does not appear." 3 Cf. Mary R. Lefkowitz, "TO KAI ETO: The First Person in Pindar," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 67 (Cambridge 1963) 177ff.</page><page sequence="11">*43 H?lderlin Ich bitte dich, glanzliebende, Sch?nste der sterblichen St?dte, Persephonens Siz, die Du ?ber den Ufern des schaafen?hrenden Wohnest, auf Akragas wohl- 5 Gebaueter Pflanzstadt, K?nigin, Freundlich mit der Unsterblichen Und der Menschen Wohlgefallen Nimm diese Krone von Pythons ber?hmtem Midas 10 Und ihn selbst, der Hellas hat Besieget mit Kunst; die vormals Pallas hat erfunden, den dreisten den Gorgonen Den verderblichen Threnos durchwindend, Athana.

Sense : "You who dwell along / across die shores of sheep-rearing [Akragas], on the well-built plant-city of Akragas" ( where Akragas is the river ). The two prepositions, ?ber and auf, are highly abnormal, for German, in this posi tion?with auf interposed between adjective (schaafen</page><page sequence="13">H?lderlin 245 ehrenden) and noun (Akragas, genitive). Possibly these prepositions imitate the Greek sequence of hn and the ac cusative case of the city dwelt in. Throughout, H?lderlin imitates Greek word order, disrupting German norms, put ting cragginess before clarity. Pflanzstadt indicates that he read the original to mean colonia, as a transplanted city: odd that he missed the sense of hill or mound, since he was satu rated with Greek (and subsequent) mountain symbolism. 7-S (P.5). If the phrase "Freundlich . . . Wohlgefallen" is construed as "You who are friendly toward . ..," that is, in apposition to the subject K?nigin and not an adverbial phrase, then H?lderlin follows here, too, the original exactly. 14 (P.,8). Durchwindend = (literally) "through-winding/' in the sense of "complicating"; this is very daring as transitive verb governing Threnos. H?lderlins dative den Gorgonen is one possible sense of the original. The three dens (two ac cusative, the middle one dative) in a row is rough only when not heard, since the middle e (long e) differs from the others. Athana at the end of the strophe follows the original and cracks the clich? Paltas Athene. 16/28 (P.9/16). Schlangenh?uptern / wohlwangigen Haupt profiles a contrast only latent in the original (where syno nyms are used). 24 (P.13). Original of ausl?schen means (verb) "blind"; the German would normally mean "extinguish" (a light, for ex ample): here the word tends to broaden the sense of the original toward annihilating (which may catch the Greek feeling by, as it were, overriding the letter). 33-34 (P.19). Jungfrau der Fl?ten keeps the ambiguity of the Greek word order. Both original and translation can read "Virgin of the Flutes" as well as "Song of the flutes" (the Lattimore translation has "music of flutes" only ). 38 ( P.21 ). streitt?nend for Greek ipuc??yKTrp. H?lderlin seems to have associated Ipi with c/w?. The original means "pierc ing," the German means "resounding with conflict."</page><page sequence="14">246 polygram / 1: pindar's twelfth pythian 42 ( P.24 ). By repeating der ( genitive plural ) before K?mpfe, H?lderlin preserves the original grammatical sequence of cases?accusative, genitive, accusative, genitive. Tins bend ing of German toward the Greek makes the line momentous, but extremely opaque, because of the interposing of Ange denken der in the middle of the phrase der volkerregten... K?mpfe. Normal German word order would be Das wohl ber?hmte Angedenken der volkerregten K?mpfe. 45 (P.26). sch?neinstimmig. The Greek means "with beauti ful dancing floors," but H?lderlins epithet means "beauti fully harmonized." Ptobably he associated the line with line 48 (Chors?nger) and was regarding the Charit?s here as a vocal chorus, not a dancing one. 55 (P.31). Hofnungslosigkeit. The original has the sense of "against expectation," but H?lderlin's word ("hopelessness") is not an altogether impossible translation. 56 (P.32). The original says "not yet," H?lderlin says "never." The last line imitates the original's rhythm. General points: Cragginess is obtained not only by the imi tation of Greek word order, but also by the dividing of the lines. The lines being shorter, the phrasing becomes knottier, transitions not suave but abrupt, single words and phrases more sharply profiled. H?lderlin s interesting compound adjectives are often (by one syllable) more polysyllabic than the originals; they are daring and new in German, not for mula-epithets, for example, schaafen?hrend, wohlwangig, selbstentstr?mt, streitt?nend, sch?neinstimmig. (Compare the function of these adjectives in the over-all combining of massiveness and thrust, vehemence and precision. ) What was H?lderlin doing here? Three combinable possi bilities: (1) making a literal translation, following in most</page><page sequence="15">H?lderlin 247 particulars the Greek word order, for his own use, and/or for his own poems (his late hymns were written after the period of these translations ) ; ( 2 ) working as he did in order to bring German and Greek together as closely as possible, in pursuit of his myth about Germany being a reborn Greece (for ex ample, his term "Vaterl?ndische Ges?nge" for poems enshrin ing in modern German visionary language the Greek wisdom of life); (3) making a draft for a translation that was never polished or finished. (These three categories correspond roughly to M. B. Benns view of H?lderlin's Pindar transla tions. )</page><page sequence="16">248 POLYGRAM / 1: pindar's TWELFTH PYTHIAN iii.

Trans pose Pindar from English (for us, his second language, even if we read him in the original) into German or Italian and something of the same sort happens. A foreign translation can bring to a familiar text that sudden air of strangeness in which we seem to see it for the first time. It "says" the same things, but it sounds different. The use of foreign translations is liberating, again, in that it keeps us from the parochialism of believing that our own language (and culture) stands in a specially privileged re lation to antiquity. When we say that a classical author "can not be translated," what we usually mean is that he cannot be translated into English. Yet just as no one language em braces the whole of reality, so no one (European) language matches Greek at every point and provides the perfect vehicle for translation. That first "totality'* of the Greek language (to adapt, and reduce, Walter Benjamin's lofty concept) can only be recovered by bringing together the different tongues into which its spirit and its form have passed.</page><page sequence="18">250 POLYGRAM / 1: pindar's TWELFTH PYTHIAN And there is a more obvious reason for approaching a dif ficult author like Pindar via another modern language. In reading an English translation, we are constantly worried by the way the writer, in trying to follow some turn of his orig inal, distorts English idiom or syntax. With a foreign transla tion, the chances are that we catch the approximation without being troubled by the distortion. Read, in the stand ard English version, Professor Lattimore's, the beginning of that passage in the third Pythian which prompted Arnold to exclaim that "the grand style in its simplicity is inimitable": But a life unshaken befell neither Peleus called Aiakidas nor godlike Kadmos, yet men say these two were given blessedness beyond all mortals. Inimitable? The grand style in its simplicity? What can Arnold have been thinking of? But read the same passage in RomagnoU's Italian: Ma inc?lume vita non ebbe n? d'Eaco il figHo, n? Cadmo divino, che pure sortirono, dicesi, fra gli uomini eocelsa fortuna. Is the inversion "n? d'Eaco il figlio" awkward, the Latinate "inc?lume" a trifle mannered? That is for Italians to worry about. The English-speaking reader receives the impression of pregnant, memorable utterance, a genuine stylistic eleva tion. Again, if you have no Greek and want to gain some sense of the famous lines from the same ode which provided Val?ry with the epigraph for "Le Cimeti?re Marin," you would be well advised to go not to Lattimore's version: Dear soul of mine, never urge a life beyond mortality, but work the means at hand to the end which is flat and uninteresting, nor to the Wade-Gery/Bowra version:1 1 H. T. Wade-Gery and C. M.

This is nobly sententious; it is also believable poetic speech. The English translators, struggling to follow the form of Pindar's invocation ("O dear soul"), come up with a phrase that could only be found in a translation. "O cuore diletto" does not belong to the Italian poetic tradition, but it is con vincing and it is elevated. From Romagnoli, the English speaking reader gains some sense of the way Pindar writes, the high, severe manner of this poet. Even if the reader possesses the lines in the original Greek, he possesses them more fully when he has heard them re-created in a living language. Not of course that Romagnoli gives us everything. His sententiousness is perhaps more in the Roman than the Greek manner, and he f ?Is to suggest both the strangeness of Pin dar's language and the fact that the Greek advances an intel lectually interesting proposition. If we want as much as this from the translator, we must go to H?lderlin: Nicht, liebe Seele, Leben unsterbliches Suche; die tunliche ersch?pf e, die Kunst.

He may well have been helped</page><page sequence="20">2$2. POLYGRAM / l: PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN by his language?Gildersleeve, it will be remembered, con sidered Italian "an exceptionally good medium for a trans lation of Pindar."2 Literary, poetic Italian enjoys an extremely fluid word order and it has preserved, until almost yesterday, the freedom to use words and constructions from the older literary language which allows the translator to suggest the formal, ceremonious quality of Pindar's diction. Above all, Italian possesses a high poetic style which, as Coleridge re marked, has been distinguished from the language of prose very much in the Greek way.3 Romagnoli can draw with full conviction on this tradition (fortified by a number of rather gaudy Greco-Latin neologisms inspired by Carducci and d'Annunzio), whereas an English translator like C. J. Billson, whose versions of Pindar appeared at almost exactly the same time, cannot draw on the older tradition of England without falling into absurdity.4 Italian, however, is weak in one re spect that matters very much to the translator of Pindar, the power to form compound epithets. Romagnoli faces the prob lem intelligently, sometimes turning them into adjectival clauses ('le spiagge di Cuma, cK?n siepe di futt?9 for ral #' wr?p Kv/ia? ??icpic?e? o^at; 'la diva che glauche ha le ciglia" etc. ) or, less often, but more strikingly since it is not an Ital ian usage, treating them as appositional noun clauses?"il Dio chioma ?Foro," "Cor?nide peplo leggiadro? and the like. Before getting down to his version of the twelfth Pythian, which does not, I think, show him at his best, it may be in teresting to quote a strophe from the third Pythian and watch how he handles the formidable problems it presents. Pindar devotes a great wondering period to the healer Asclepius: 2 Selections from The Brief Mention ( Baltimore 1930) 310. 3 "I cannot but deem it ... an advantage in the Italian tongue, in many other respects inferior to our own, that the language of poetry is more distinct from that of prose than with us. From the earlier appear ance and established primacy of the Tuscan poets, concurring with the number of independent states, and the diversity of written dialects, the Italians have gained a poetic idiom, as the Greeks before them had ob tained from the same causes with greater and more various discrimi nations, for example, the Ionic for their heroic verses. . . ."

How difficult this is to translate Lattimore conveys very well: They came to him with ulcers the flesh had grown, or their limbs mangled with the gray bronze, or bruised with the stone flung from afar, or die body stormed with summer fever, or chill; and he released each man and led him from his individual grief. Some he treated with guile of incantations, some with healing potions to drink; or he tended the limbs with salves from near and far; and some by the knife he set on their feet again. "If a man should undertake to translate Pindar, word for word," Cowley is reported as saying, "it would be thought that one madman had translated another." Lattimore's ver sion is close but it is not word for word (arguably be is too free with this author), nor is there anything about it that suggests insanity, either the poet's or ?ie normal kind. In deed it is too level, too pedestrian, and fails to convey the habitual strangeness of Pindar's Greek. Cowley continues: "as may appear, when he, that understands not the original, reads the verbal traduction of him into Latin prose, than which nothing seems more raving." This does not seem to me true of Boeckh's translation into Latin prose which, particu larly if printed in verse lengths, gives one the sense of the Greek at a glance and blocks out the structure in a way that an English translation cannot: Eos igitur, quotquot advenerant sponte natis ulceribus affecti, aut cano aere membra vulnerati</page><page sequence="22">254 POLYGRAM / l: PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN aut saxo eminus iacto, aut aestivo igni corpus laesi aut frigore, liberans alium alius alius generis doloribus exemit: hos quidem mitibus incantamentis curans, illos lenes potus bibentes, vel membris circumhgans undique medicamina; alios vero sectionibus constituit rectos. And here, finally, is Romagnoli's version: E quanti giungevano afflitti d'ingenite piaghe, o trafitti da lucido bronzo le membra, o dall'avventar di madgni, o sf atti dall'alido estivo, o dal gelo, mandava disciolti dai var? travagli, di blandi scongiuri cingendo talun, beverato quefl'altro di miti pozioni, o tutte di farmachi succhi f asciando le membra; ed altri rimisene in piedi con abiH tagli. The long Greek sentence is very beautiful. It is elaborate, yet it does not feel "constructed" in the way a Latin period us ually does. Its contours have been molded by the stress and tension of growth. It is orderly and symmetrical, because order and symmetry are the natural form of the material in the poet's mind. And it delights in variety: the cola are ir regular and the construction changes, notably with the verb pinontas in the sixth line. It contemplates, in loving detail, a wide range of sickness and cure ( three lands of sickness, two of them subdivided; four lands of cure), and yet contem plates it with a kind of prescientific (but in no sense primi tive ) wonder?wonder at the variety of human suffering and, equally, at man's power to heal. To get anything of this sort from a translation we must go to H?lderlin, but Romagnoli is in his way satisfying and certainly superior to any English translation I know. He still breathes something of the same air as the Greek, he seems to belong to the same family. In the second line Romagnoli can use, quite naturally, a "Greek ac cusative" ("trafitti le membra"?though I do not know why polios, "gray," becomes "luddo"), his third line is monu mental like Pindar's and moves to the same stately dactylic tune. He does not attempt the change of construction in line</page><page sequence="23">Ettore Romagnoli 255 six, using instead a causative verb, "beverato" (where H?l derlin dares to follow the Greek: "class Linderndes sie / Tranken"), but he has kept the shape of the whole period: row ftcv ?v, wraot, ?xokov : e quanti giungevano (eos igitur, quotquot advenerant) Awrot?... I|aycr : mandava disciolti (liberans... exemit) tow piv... ?fi&lt;t&gt; ir(?v : cingendo talun (hosquidem... curans) An English translator would of course not be well advised to retain this periodic structure, but my point is that the Italian translator, without violating the genius of his language, can and Romagnoli does, and in so doing he brings the reader to within hailing distance of Pindar's way of writing. Romagnoli's Pindar seems to me to represent an acceptable level of translation?the level we ought to be able to count on. (When the right poet turns up we may hope for some thing better, but gods' gifts come when they will. ) If Latti more leaves Pindar quite dead, Romagnoli undoubtedly gives him a kind of life. He conveys something of the movement and tone and what one may call the outward aspect of a Pindaric ode. Further than that be does not try to go. He hardly attempts to re-create, or reproduce, in Italian the inner life of Pindar's speech. It may be wondered, of course, how far this is possible, or even desirable, in a modern lan guage. Take a typical Pindaric phrase from the tenth Ne mean which the Loeb editor translates: "But from Sicyon, they returned with silver wine-cups." What the Greek says is Sucvcovot^c 8* ?pyvp&lt;&amp;d' VT &lt;i uvv olvrjpals &lt;?&gt;t?Xcus hre?av ?that is, they were "silvered with wine cups." There is no doubt about the picture; even a pedestrian commentator like Fennell sees that what Pindar means is "with gleam of silver shining on them." But the picture is a function of the Ian</page><page sequence="24">256 POLYGRAM / l: PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN guage?here, at least, intuition and expression are one. Pindar, in his habitual way, "disintegrates the fictions of common perception into their sensuous elements" (to use Santayana's fine description once again) and transfers the dazzle of the wine cups onto the men who carry them. But it is on the linguistic level that this happens: the moment of hallucinated vision is made possible by a kind of explosion that took place within the sentence as it was forming. When the dust settles, the elements are found to be differently con stituted and it is the men, not the cups, that shine. What is the translator to do? He cannot simply copy Pindar's phrase in English ("silvered with wine cups") as I did, for this will give no sense of the pressure at work in the language. And yet even this is better than doing what Lattimore does and placidly restoring Pindar's sentence to apple-pie order: From Sikyon they departed5 with silver of the wine goblets, Risk nothing, win nothing. Romagnoli at least has the de cency to suggest that the Greek is exciting: 1? recinse fulgore d'argento quando essi, le Sale del vino recando, tornar da Sicione. He tries hard for the picture, but he unfolds it into something far too immediately comprehensible, and into far too many words, and so fails to startle us into vision. Take another example, the splendid phrase from the sixth Isthmian, olvo86kov &lt;?iaAav xpw?&gt; 7T &lt;f&gt;pLKvlavy "a wine bowl shuddering with gold " The scholiast's comment, illustrating that refusal to face complexity and turbulence of which W. B. Stanford has spoken, offers two lines of interpretation: (1) the bowl is carved in high relief so that the surface seems rough or bristly (like a boar's back, Aristarchus says); (2) the bowl shines or glitters. This failure of insight is carried over into Virgil's version of the phrase, "?spera signis pocula," which marks an imaginative decline, a more limited, purely "human" vision. Pindar's bowl is a numinous object?one is 5 Following the MS reading, airi?av</page><page sequence="25">Ettore Romagnoli 257 reminded of the pewter jug with the sun shining on it which revealed to Jakob Boehme tibe being of God; Virgil's em bossed cups are no more than decorative objets ?tart. Where the tradition of interpretation and even Virgil fail us, it is not surprising that translators should do no better. Lattimore writes "a wine goblet cut in shuddering gold," keeping Pindar's word but not risking his construction. Ro magnoli wanders off into verbiage and loses tibe object al together: una coppa di vino, di guizzi tutti aurei comisca. There is more poetry, and more Pindar, in Boeckh's quite literal "phialam auro horrentem." A word-for-word render ing gets far closer to the original than a translation into second-rate verse (tibe point Coleridge made to the com pany of sensible and well-educated women puzzled by Cowley's dithyrambic treatment of the second Olympian). But of course we want much more. If Pindar is ever to be come a force in English poetry?and until he becomes a force in English poetry, we cannot really read him in Greek?we need a translator who can write with this sort of power: Stanching, quenching ocean of a motionable mind; Ground of being, and granite of it: past all Grasp God, throned behind Death with a sovereignty that heeds but hides, bodes but abides. He would not of course imitate Hopkins' mannerisms, but he could hardly fail to learn from the way Hopkins wrenches words out of their usual relationships, fusing them into new, torrential units of speech, locking them into almost asyntactic confrontations where they explode into meaning. (A phrase like "past aH / Grasp God" invites, entirely in Pindar's man ner, a variety of interpretation: "God [who is] past all grasp," or, yoked into a convulsive compound, a "past-all-grasp God," or "when all is passed, grasp, take hold of, God." ) H?lderlin, with whom the true Pindar first enters the Euro pean literary tradition, is the only translator who satisfies</page><page sequence="26">Z$S POLYGRAM / 1: PINDAR^ TWELFTH PYTHIAN these conditions. He did not, unfortunately, tackle either of the odes from which I have quoted, but the first sentence of the passage from the third Pythian which we examined dis locates relationship in a comparable way and presents the translator with a similar test. Romagnoli, as we saw, wrote "E quanti giungevano aflitti d'ingenite piaghe." (And Latti more, "They came to him with ulcers the flesh had grown") But what Pindar says, literally, is "They came the compan ions of self-grown wounds.'* On this curious expression Gildersleeve comments: "The sphere of partnership and companionship is wider in Greek than in English. We us ually make the disease, not the sufferer, the companion." H?lderlin, however, follows his usual practice and repro duces the Greek exactly: Die nun, so viele kommen eingeborner Wunden Gef?hrten. Were the translator not a great poet, writing in the belief that Greece was being reborn on German soil, we would put this down to crass Kteral-mindedness. What we have here is obviously something different. This is not an example of the translator allowing the original to violate the normal struc ture of his own language; rather, H?lderlin has allowed the Greek to impose its own view of reality, its own means of handling and disposing the data of experience. We all say that we want to get as close as possible to the Greek, but few of us care to get as close as this. In reading Greek we try, as best we can, to "think in Greek," that is, we enter the Greek world and accept its different structuring of reality. In so doing, we preserve the essential separation between the Greek world and our own. H?lderlin, driven by his myth of rebirth, moves in the opposite direction: instead of going to Greece, he brings Greece to Germany. He tries to think-in Greek-in-German. To translate Pindar, on this view, means to become Pindar and this is a higher price than most trans lators are prepared to pay. "Beyond Gadara towards the darkness we must not pass." It is a relief to turn back from this frontier of translation to the</page><page sequence="27">Ettore Romagnoli 259 sensible middle ground where Romagnoli operates. His ver sion of Pythian 12 does not, as I said, show him at his best, but it has its points of interest and there is perhaps some thing to be learned from his errors. 1-3. He begins with the verb of invocation which establishes the poet's presence, and the urgency of his presence (unlike Lattimore, who puts it at the end of the third line). And "arnica del fasto," for philaglae ("fasto" = pomp, splendor), is quite attractive, but it was a bad mistake to hold the phrase over till the middle of the second line. The shine needs to be up front. (So that the poem may start and end with bright ness: the unhoped-for, god-revealed moment of the conclu sion is in Pindar always associated with aigla, "brilliance"; cf. the aigla diosdotos of his last poem.) "Citt? la pi? bella ...* has too many words ("albergo" in poetic Italian simply means dwelling place) and fails to catch the way Pindar glances at the topos?if it was one then?that cities too have their death. H?lderlin's literal "Sch?nste der sterblichen St?dte" (or for that matter the Wade-Gery/Bowra "fairest of mortal cities") is die only rendering. "Ferace di greggi" is a mere statement?the place is rich in flocks, whereas the Greek is momentary, and visual. Lattimore's "where the sheep wander" is better. 4-8. The repetition of "gradisci" would pass in a translation of Meleager, but it will not do for Pindar who wastes no words. However, "intrecciando" the literal sense of the Greek, has the right concentration and leaves the reader to work out the meaning, as Pindar means him to do, unlike Lattimore's "followed in song," which lodges an enfeebling gloss in the text. (Wade-Gery and Bowra compromise with "wove to a tune.*) Gildersleeve is sound here: "The hardness of Pindar, not to say his obscurity, is not to be outdone, but it is not to be done away with. There are to be no periphrases for the sake of clearness." (Brief Mention p.351.) The Loeb translation, he adds, "sometimes goes too far in helping the student to follow the text." In lines 6-8 Romagnoli, like all translators except H?lder lin, fails to frame the action between Pindar's two terminal points, Pallas and Athana. See comment on 20-21.</page><page sequence="28">26o POLYGRAM / 1: PINDAR'S TWELFTH PYTHIAN 9-11. The diction is not very attractive, though Romagnoli does suggest something of the movement of the Greek and something of the strangeness of the action. But he spoils the rest of the strophe by changing the order of events. He pre sents a more or less linear sequence, moving from Perseus' killing of Medusa to his liberation of his mother Dana? from Polydectes, whereas in the Greek the action is framed (again) by the "heads" of the first and last lines, the snake wreathed heads of the Gorgons, the lovely head of Medusa (herself one of the Gorgons). Within this constructed space Pindar moves about freely, touching now on this detail, now on that. 17-18. The first Une has a shine on it and is rhythmically stronger than Lattimore's "born of the raining gold," but Romagnoli's Toro piovuto dall'?tere" hasn't the primitive power of Pindar's "self-flowing gold." H?lderlin scores again by being literal and scores doubly since his extraordinary epi thet "selbstentstr?mtem" outdoes the Greek in elemental power. Romagnoli, by telling us that the gold which fathered Perseus rained from the aether (three pieces of information which Pindar omits), weakens the image and moves halfway to the familiar anthropomorphic story of Zeus descending in a shower of gold and lying with Dana?. The Greek con templates a far more ancient mythological event: a child begotten by gold streaming of its own volition, ?wb xpwov ... a?To/ju?Ttoc KarapplovTo% as the scholiast says. Note also phamen: not "si narra" but the Yeatsian "I declare." Credo quia mi rabile est. 20-21. "Il lungo ululo lugubre" hasn't the stridency one hears in Pindar's eriklangtan goon (see Middleton on H?lderlins etymologically incorrect but very powerful formation, "streitt?nende"), but there is some energy, and imagination, in the words that follow?the lament spurting ( "sprizzante" ) from the flickering jaws ("fitto guizzar delle fauci") of the monster. However, neither Romagnoli nor H?lderlin nor any one else can suggest the remarkable way Pindar's sentence grows in the space between the definite article, ton, near the start of line 20, and its substantive, goon, at the end of the next Une.</page><page sequence="29">Ettore Romagnoli 261 Note that while you can speak of this sentence "growing" between these two points, it is equally possible to say that it is placed, or 'lield," between them?as lines 7 and 8, more obviously, are held between the two names of the goddess, Pallas and Athana, set at the beginning and the end of the couplet. The translators problem here is not primarily one of syntax and word order. It is rather that the effect of the Greek is partly visual, whereas Western poets have tradi tionally been committed to the temporal nature of their art.6 Pindar sets out his meaning in space, visually, in addition to developing it through time: the Gorgons are contained within the limits established by the divine names. This is a dimension of Greek poetry to which we are very insensitive; with our classroom habit of construing we reduce it to the limitations of our own syntax and there would be great value in a translation which used the typographical resources of modern poetry in order to make us look at an ode of Pindar. Of Mallarm?'s "Un Coup de D?s" Val?ry remarked, "il me semble de voir la figure d'une pens?e, pour la premi?re fois plao?e dans notre espace." A translator might learn a good deal from the way the four elements of the main sentence (UN COUP DE D?S / JAMAIS / N'ABOLIRA / LE HASARD), first given in the title, are held in suspense through several pages of smaller type and "released" bit by bit. 25-27. Romagnoli goes badly wrong, again, by changing the sequence of phrases and putting "dei balli compagna fedel" (his not particularly happy translation of pistoi khoreutan martures, "faithful witnesses of the dancers") at the start of the strophe rather than at the end of the period. Pindar's phrase is the culmination of a process which started at (Greek) line 19, if not before: Athene created the music of the flute in imitation of the fearful cry wrenched from the jaws of the monster Euryale; created it and gave it to men, naming it, by an etymological pun, "the many-headed tune." 6 Except for occasional, virtuoso performances, like Herbert's "Easter Wings," written in imitation of the Greek technopaegnion, or the re peated initial letters in Dante's terrace of the proud (Purgatorio 12) spelling out the word VOM and reminding MAN that his primal sin is pride.</page><page sequence="30">262 POLYGRAM / 1: PINDAR S TWELFTH PYTHIAN The flute's music calls men to war and also, as in this case, to the games (mimic war, strife transformed into play), as it passes through (compare the cry that passed through the jaws of Euryale and, earlier on, the death cry that "poured" from the bowed snake heads) "the slender bronze and reeds" ?that is, the flute with its bronze mouthpiece, hendiadys marking the conjimction of artifact and natural object and developing the poem's movement from "nature" to art, from savagery to order, from barbarous dissonance to musical sound and, equally, the poem's theme of art's sources in the daemonic. (TTie reeds through which the music passes were, in the myth, the snake necks of the Gorgons.) These reeds, the poem continues, grow?the Greek says dwell, the verb used of the tutelary goddess' habitance of her city in line 3, a recurrence preserved only by H?lderlin?in the dancing grounds by the city of the Graces, in the precinct of the nymph Cephisis. We have come a long way from the dark business of the central part of the poem, the crying snake heads, Polydectes' cruelty and Dana? s suffering, the people of Seriphus frozen into stone. Now, the dancing grounds, the city of the Graces, fostering spirits of growth and bloom and fruit, sanctified territory. It is at this point, as the sentence comes to a full close, that the reeds emerge as "the faithful witnesses of the dancers." Note the suggestions: ( 1 ) the reeds ( we may think of them as surrounding the dancing grounds ) separate wild from cultivated land; (2) as witnesses, the reeds remind us of the ring of spectators in whose presence Midas won his victory with the flute; (3) as the source of the flute's music, the reeds bear faithful witness by keeping the time?the measure of art, as against the lawless clamor of the monster world which Athene has subdued. 28-32. The quality of the writing suggests that Romagnoli is not very interested. One assumes he accepts tie genial old view that Pindar trots out a few gnomes to bridge a gap or bring the evening's entertainment to a decorous close. (Note the metrically banal final couplet, two nine-syllable lines jogging to the same 2:5:8 rhythm.) But Pindar is very in tent: the series of statements that chart the twists and turns of vicissitude may confront each other with little intervenient discourse but they are certainly not punctuated by yawns. In</page><page sequence="31">Ettore Romagnoli 263 fact, their function is clear enough. First, the play of un expected reversals enacted in the myth must be met or "held" by an equally active play of maxims. Much has hap pened beyond, or against, expectation"?for Medusa, Poly dectes, Dana?, Perseus, and of course for Midas who broke the mouthpiece of his flute, we are told, but won all the same. And, above, and beyond, all expectation, we have wit nessed the unpredictable inrush of divine grace, the sudden gold that flowed for Perseus' begetting. Second, and perhaps more important, the last three lines of the narrative have moved from mythological violence into a world of harmony and order. A gracious, divinely sanctioned interlude: that must not be prolonged. The jostling assertions that bring the poem to a close duly conduct us back to f amiliar territory, to our world of chance and change and labor. Pindar's gnomic passages have defeated every translator. Lattimore's conclusion is as dull, intellectually, as Romag noli's and not so well written. The last seven lines of the Wade-Gery/Bowra version, however, are not without ac complishment, even though the fingering is too light for Pindar: Any bliss that man may win (And without labour, none) God shall perfect, To-day, perhaps! yet Fate must be abided. Then loi Time's hand Throwing at you the unforeseen Turns calculation upside down, and gives you One thing, but another not yet. And yet perhaps the light touch is appropriate. The solem nity with which the aging poet will contemplate the god's gifts and man's uncertain fate is still far ahead. Here the note is buoyant, confident: "This he gives, that not yet."

Pound wrote in 1918: "The dilection of Greek poets has waned during the past pestilent century, and this decline has, I think, kept pace with a decline in the use of Latin cribs to Greek authors.* Later in die same essay he went on to say: The Latin can be a whole commentary on the Greek, or at least it can give one the whole parsing and order, and let one proceed at a comfortable rate with but the most rudimentary knowledge of the original language* (And the most rudi mentary knowledge of Latin, he might have added. ) Anyone who doubts the truth of Pound's claim can set Boeckh's version of the first strophe of this poem beside the Loeb translation and ask himself which provides more help with the Greek. Here is the Loeb : Lover of splendour, fairest of mortal cities, home of Persephone! thou that inhabitest the hill of noble dwell ings above the banks, where feed die sheep beside the stream of AcragasI I beseech thee, O queen, along with the kindly favour of gods and men, graciously to wel come, at the hands of renowned Midas, this coronal from Pytho. I beseech thee also to welcome himself, as cham pion over all Hellas in that art, which Pallas Athene in vented when she wove into music the dismal death-dirge of the Gorgons bold? Apart from the fact that it follows the Greek in a way that even the worst (or best) English translation cannot hope to do, the advantages of Boeckh's Latin is that it is dead. His words are simply counters. They perform their function, which is to map the original, without raising irrelevant lit erary associations of their own. The publication of the major ( and then the minor) authors with facing Latin cribs could do a great deal to encourage the study of Greek poetry. It would not be an expensive under taking.

But who wants such books? (Hie publishers question.) The classical elite presumably takes its classical authors straight. The Greekless reader?the captive public of the Humanities and the C.C. courses, the occasional browser in search of the glory tiiat was Greece?wants his translations in English, not Latin. And in between? How many people care enough for Greek poetry to force their way to the texts despite the difficulties of the language? How many people know that there is something "over there," in the squiggly writing across the river, as Tim Reynolds put it in a recent Arion?something that they need, and cannot do without, and cannot get from any translation? However many, or however few, everything depends on them: ces ent?t?s aux quels on doit la conservation de feu sacr? pendant les jours mauvais. D.S.C-R.</page></plain_text>
