<plain_text><page sequence="1">44 The Writer's Work, Guide to Effective Comtosition. Dean Memering and Frank O'Hare. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1980. Pp. 474. Many college writing teachers, faced with the conflicting claims of the numerous theories of composition espoused in the last two decades, have succumbed to the desire not to be bound to any one method and instead have attempted to avail themselves of the benefits of eclecticism, drawing material from many sources into patchwork programs. While a fortunate few have succeeded in synthesizing diverse methods into cohesive and coherent courses of study, many have only confused their students by not allowing sufficient time to master one system before proceeding to another. This result could be called the "If it's Tuesday, this must be sentence-combining" syndrome. Eclecticism is both the bane and the boon of Dean Memering and Frank O'Hare's The Writer's Work. Sacrificing depth for diversity, Memering and O'Hare manage to include in one textbook such disparate material as sentence-combining and the Christensen method, and to incorporate the work of theorists like Alton Becker and Kenneth Burke. Because identifying an audience before setting pen to paper is a dictum of most composition courses, it seems reasonable to ask whom Memering and O'Hare believe their audience to be. It is presumably those college composition teachers whose experience is sufficient to allow them to choose wisely among the multitudinous options presented and to supplement the sometimes scanty explanations. Only those able to do both can avail them- selves fully of the seemingly limitless flexibility of this textbook. Broadly divided into two sections with the headings "Writing"f and "Skills," The Writer's Work presents the writing process as a series of choices which the student must make. "The Composing Process" is the first of five chapters in the "writing" section, and it introduces the basic considerations of purpose, audience, and style, considerations which are successfully integrated throughout the text. The included writing exercises allow the student to explore the demands of each of these considerations and require him to produce accounts of personal experiences for different audiences and from different perspectives. These early exercises are indicative of one of the chief strengths of The Writer's Work: the assignments included throughout the text consistently provide opportunities for the student to actively experience the lessons of each chapter. "The Composing Process" chapter closes with a flexible writing structure consisting of prewriting, writing, and rewriting steps. The limited delineation of these steps allows considerable overlap, thus preventing unnecessary regimentation and reflecting the actual composing processes of many experienced writers. Personal writing, the mode that most students find easiest, is the concern of Chapter 2. Even within this relatively open area, different strata of formality are presented. Beginning with free- writing exercises and journal keeping, the assigsments progress to</page><page sequence="2">45 more structured voice-identification exercises and practice in ghost writing. The latter two are particularly valuable; the voice- identification exercises manage to incorporate consideration of audience into this most nihilistic of writing modes by demanding that the student consider how he wishes to be preceived, while the ghost-writing assignment requires the student to find an appropriate voice for recounting another student's story. Both of these assignments illustrate that the writer's voice can be manipulated to suit his purpose. The relatively informal exercises of Chapter 2 are followed by more structured invention procedures in Chapter 3, which is entitled "Strategies of Exposition." It is with this chapter that the teacher must begin to contend with Memering and O'Hare's penchant for presenting a potpourri of strategies that lack sufficient elaboration and tax the student's ability to assimilate. There is adequate material for several courses included in this chapter. Field analysis is extracted from the larger framework of Richard E. Young, Alton Becker, and Kenneth Pike's particle-wave-field theory, but it remains confusing even in this simplified form of presentation. Kenneth Burke's Pentad fares better, because it is presented essentially as a newswriter's formula with the ratios wisely reduced to an easily understandable form of interaction between questions. Brainstorming is introduced as a multileveled activity which includes both the collection of raw information and the search for a focus for that information; it is perhaps the most useful invention technique contained in The Writer's Work. Following an informative assessment of the limited value of the traditional outline as an organizing procedure, Memering and O'Hare briefly describe five types of expository writing, each of which represents a formal choice dictated by the writer's intention. Included are thesis and support, comparison and contrast, process, classification, and definition. Examples of each type of expository development are presented, and writing activities are recommended. The selection of writing examples is the second major strength of The Writer's Work. Numerous complete essays of varying quality that were written by college students are included, allowing the reader to analyze samples written on a level that does not seem unattainable to him and to determine which stylistic choices prove effective. Even the professional writing samples are chosen for usefulness rather than name value, and they often include everyday, natural speech designed to show that good writing doesn't need to be pretentious. By not trying to incorporate a literature course in the composition classroom, Memering and O'Hare manage to avoid the pitfalls caused by inappropriate readings that many composition text authors encounter. Chapter 4, entitled "Reasoned Writing," introduces the techniques of evaluation and argumentation. The basic principles of logic are discussed, with special attention devoted to syllogisms and fallacies. Exercises in fallacy identification follow, providing a means for the teacher to measure the efficacy of the presentation. The writing assignments include reviews and persuasive essays, with</page><page sequence="3">46 accuracy of information and simplicity of argumentation stressed in the instructions. Once again however, the teacher is faced with a dilemma: should he supplement Memering and O'Hare's material with lessons of his own devising, or should he exclude either portions or the entirety of this chapter? Argumentation is often taught as an entire semester course, but the material included in Chapter 4 is not detailed enough for such application. On the other hand, given the difficulties that many students encounter in reasoned writing, an attempt to include this chapter in a curriculum based on The Writer's Work would necessarily usurp time needed to develop the earlier expository skills adequately. "Writing with Sources" is the final chapter in the "Writing" section of The Writer's Work, and it concentrates on the research paper, the most highly structured type of writing that most students will be required to produce. Beginning with a thorough introduction to library use and reference works, Chapter 5 also contains detailed information regarding stylesheets that includes footnote and biblio- graphy examples, and practical information concerning note-taking procedures and the use of evidence. The chapter closes with a list of fifty possible research topics which many teachers will find useful. As already noted, the problems in the "Writing" section of The Writer's Work result mainly from its abundant but inadequately developed material. Although this problem of selection is not peculiar to Memering and O'Hare's textbook, it is made to seem more pronounced by the sheer volume of possibilities presented by the text, possibilities which time limitations must prevent from being realized. Teachers who are able and willing to choose wisely and supplement the lessons will find Memering and O'Hare's treatment of the writing process very useful however; the problems mentioned above may well be outweighed by the benefits of practical exercises, and pertinent readings. While much of the "Skills" section is equally well-conceived, its flaws are also more severe. Designed to assist students in producing writing that is both gramatically correct and structurally mature, the six "Skills" chapters employ the same informal, conversational style of presentation of the first five chapters, but that style is inadequate to meet the demands of explaining sentence-level structural considerations. Particularly in the later chapters, Memering and O'Hare are forced to revert to the nebulous explanations of dubious validity that have long plagued students who seek precise yet simple explanations of sentential phenomena. Chapter 6 is devoted to sentence-combining, a technique which O'Hare was instrumental in advancing in the early 1970's. Imprecision is not a problem here, since the sentence-combining exercises constitute a well-defined system that has been proven effective as a pedagogical tool. Short, kernel-like sentences are presented, and the student enlarges his syntactic repetoire by combining them into longer, more complex sentences through the employment of a variety of strategies. Both cued and noncued exercises are included; the cueing system is nontechnical and simple to understand, and it</page><page sequence="4">47 ingeniously also provides instruction in punctuation, while the noncued exercises allow the student the opportunity to make his own stylistic choices. Chapter 6 closes with "sentence chunk" exercises which present two or more sentences that constitute a discrete unit isolated from a paragraph. Study of how sentences interact provides a segue into Chapter 7, which is entitled "Effective Paragraphs." In keeping with their dictum that writing is a series of choices, Memering and O'Hare assert that "a paragraph should not be an accident; it should be carefully thought out and polished." Given the abuse recently heaped upon the paragraph as a unit of discourse, the authors of The Writer's Work find it necessary to qualify their statements by noting that what they are speaking about is "an idealized paragraph." Their ideal is found in Francis Christensen's "A Generative Rhetoric of the Paragraph" (College Comosition and Communication, December 1965), which presents a paragraph theory based on levels of generality. In identifying coordinate, subordinate, and mixed as the only possible paragraph patterns, the theory ignores the possibility of superordination, demanding instead that a sentence at a higher level of generality than the one preceding it begin a new paragraph, and it is also inadequate to explain the discontinuous dependencies that are so much a part of discourse. However, Memering and O'Hare's paragraph chapter does provide a practical means of teaching the traditional values of unity and coherence, thus faring somewhat better as a pedagogical tool than as an analytical one. Chapter 8, entitled "Effective Sentences," is a discussion of specific considerations in sentence-crafting; as such, it would more naturally follow the sentence-combining chapter, and why it does not isn't clear. Beginning with the usual indictment of such freshman writing sins as wordiness and overuse of the passive voice, the authors progress to a more positive presentation of such concerns as parallelism and effective repetition, their intention being to promote the virtues of clarity, economy, emphasis, and variety. Brief explanations of structural concerns are provided, followed by numerous sample sentences that illustrate the principles under consideration. It is unfortunate that Memering and O'Hare are seldom able to incorporate the advances made by linguistic inquiry of the last twenty-five years. Since the birth of transformational grammar in 1957, progress in syntactic study has been rapidly achieved; perhaps the two advances of linguistics potentially of most value to composition teachers are its precise terminology for describing syntactic structures and its insight into the relationship between comprehension ease and syntactic form. The former area of study is largely responsible for the precision and effectiveness of the sentence-combining chapter in The Writer's Work, yet that precision is abandoned in Chapter 8, and the reader is instead confronted by anthropomorphism of the type that has marred so many other composition texts. For example, a passive sentence is described as "one in which the doer of the action is invisible (The bear was shot), or the doer is hidden behind the word "fby"</page><page sequence="5">48 (The bear was shot by the hunter)." While such an explanation may serve to identify passives for the beginning student, it seems that more accurate and revealing terms than "invisible" and "hidden" should be used in a college-level text. Also disturbing is Memering and O'Hare's lack of adequate explanation for their usage criteria. In what sense do they employ the word "direct" in claiming that active sentences are more direct than passives? Although that statement represents the conventional wisdom, more accurate and useful explanations of the pragmatic considerations of active/passive pairs are possible. In a similar fashion, the authors assume that the use of a prepositional phrase in the sentence "She reacted with sarcasm to his proposal" is more emphatic than the use of an adverb in "She reacted sarcastically to his proposal," but the basis for this assumption is not given. Although in-depth explanations of linguistic foundations may not be appropriate in a textbook, it is certainly reasonable to expect educators to be aware of advances in fields related to their own and to provide ample consideration to how those advances bear on their own work. The problems of imprecise terminology and insufficient basis for judgment are less pronounced in Chapter 9, which examines considerations of effective diction, but they again become quite disturbing in the first of the final two chapters. Chapter 10 is a usage guide cast in the mold of traditional grammar handbooks; although Memering and O'Hare wisely avoid the absolutism that many grammar books exhibit in the face of conflicting usage trends, they are often unable to provide precise structural explanations of conventions that are generally held. Exemplifying this is their explanation of mixed compound subject agreement, which is phrased in a manner that actually allows ungrammatical sentences. Chapter 11, concerned with spelling and punctuation conventions, is somewhat more successful, possibly because of the relative simplicity of the material presented. The criticism contained in this review is not intended to suggest that The Writer's Work is not a useful pedagogical tool; it is only intended to note that certain aspects of the book can be improved. When compared to other available textbooks instead of a nonexistent ideal, Memering and O'Hare's work must be judged more favorably. Given the preparadigmatic state of composition research, the authors are justified in their inclusion of diverse material. Without adequate criteria available for absolute judgment, the teacher must serve as final authority regarding which techniques are best employed, and The Writer's Work allows him to do so. It is probable that further research will enable teachers to choose with greater confidence the materials to be included in a composition course. When that research has been conducted, Memering and O'Hare's textbook will become dated; until then it will remain a practical tool for experienced educators.
