<plain_text><page sequence="1">Das Sendschreiben al-QusayrFs ?ber das Sufitum. Introduction, translation and com mentary by Richard Gr?mlich. (Freiburger Islamstudien, Band XII.) pp. xix, 659. Stuttgart, Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH, 1989. DM 240. To be an heir of a glorious scholarly tradition is a great thing. This consideration is true in respect of both the author - Abu' 1-Q?sim 'Abd al-Kanm al-Qushayri (465/1072) of Nays?b?r and his translator - Richard Gr?mlich. The former represents the oldest school of Sufism and Ash'ar? dogmatics - that of Khur?s?n - and lists among his teachers such outstanding S?fis and theologians as Abu 'Al? al-Daqq?q (d. 405/1015) and Abu 'Abd al-Rahm?n al-Sulam? (d. 412/1021), Abu Bakr b. F?rak (d. 406/1015) and Abu Ish?q al-Isfar?yini'(d. 418/1027). It is owing to his learned predecessors Abu Nasr al-Sarr?j al-T?s? (d. 378/988) and al-Sulam?, who had thoroughly collected and classified oral S?fi heritage, that al-Qushayri's al-Ris?la became the most popular S?fi manual comparable only with 'Aw?rif al-md?rij'by 'Umar al-Suhrawardi, which incidentally was also translated by Professor Gr?mlich under the title Die Gaben der Erkenntnisse (Wiesbaden, 1978). The influence on the translator's work of the traditions of German Islamology is detectable too: al-Ris?la had already been paraphrased by Richard Hartmann as early as 1914, while Gramlich's approach and even the structure of the Sendschreiben remind the reviewer of Helmut Ritter's Das Meer der Seele (Leiden, 1955). The same can be said about previous books by the scholar, i.e. Die schulischen Derwischorden Per siens (Bde. I?III, Wiesbaden, 1965-81). Pointing out this influence the reviewer does not imply that the methods used by Gr?mlich are out-dated or apologetic. Just the reverse : the " Sendschrieben " has demonstrated that they remain sound having stood the test of time. The translator's "Einleitung" (E 11-19) abounds with helpful references to medieval Muslim writings that treat biographies of al-Qushayri, his teachers and disciples, as well as of those who commented on his chef-d'oeuvre. One may feel that Gr?mlich shrinks from an attempt to analyse these multifarious data. Instead, he simply recounts the major events of al-Qushayrfs life and presents the topics discussed in his book. This, of course, is a deliberate implementation of research principles by the scholar, who does not want to thrust his views on the audience. His few general conclusions are faultless (e.g. E 16), though they sound somewhat commonplace to specialists, who have the right to expect more spectacular results from the translator's tremendous undertaking. The translation for the most part is readable, even for one whose command of German is rather poor. Gramlich's long experience as a researcher in the field of medieval S?fi literature helps him to overcome serious difficulties presented by the Arabic text with its technical S?fi terminology and constant allusions to various aspects of Islamic tradition (Qur'?n, hadtth, adab, kal?m, religious and secular poetry). Some passages of the Sendschreiben suggest interpretations other than those preferred by the translator, but it seems that nowhere alternative readings are the only possible. The notes are concise and conveniently inserted in the text. They are well-documented by an impressive array of Arabic and Persian sources. Islamological scholarship is cited less frequently, though by no means neglected. The notes can be divided into two groups. The first includes</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 387 numerous references to medieval Arabic and Persian writings, where the same (or similar) statements and verses by earlier S?fis, as those cited by al-Qushayn, can be found. Extensive (and possibly distracting) biographical material is wisely replaced by short references, which (though Gr?mlich modestly denies it, see E 19) are sometimes almost exhaustive. He seems to draw from vast card indexes (or computerised data) carefully collected by him during his translation of al-Ghazal?, al-Suhraward?, and his work on his more analytical books about Persian Sufism. This fact adds to the importance of the Sendschreiben and makes it an indispensable reference-book for every serious student of Islamic mysticism which saves him a lot of tedious work. The second group of notes is the translator's explanation of obscure passages of the text. These are either Gramlich's own elucidations, or his translations of the relevant parts from al 'Ar?sfs (d. 1293/1876) and to a lesser extent al-Ans?rfs (d. 926/1520) commentaries on al Ris?la. Perhaps he sometimes places too much reliance on their understanding of al-Qushayrfs words. At least once, I believe, (O. 14) he gives al-'Ar?sfs rather far-fetched interpretation instead of a more literal translation, which, as a matter of fact, appears much later (45.4), when al-'Ar?sfs comments are ignored. Comparing these parallel passages the reviewer has discovered further slight inconsistencies, i.e. tawh?dw&amp;s first rendered as "Einheitsbekenntnis" (the concept included in the Analytischer Index), then as " Monotheismus " (the concept lacking in A.I.) ; sad in the parallel statements is translated first as " Tun ", later as " Wirken " (compare the translation of al-Junayd's words in 0.11 and 45.5, though in this case Gr?mlich acknowledges the difference). These, of course, are mere trivia, but they may discourage the reader not quite at home in the Muslim theological Gedankenwelt, and unable to compare the translation with the original. The fact that the same technical term is rendered differently without being mentioned in brackets may make him think about two different concepts. He will have difficulties with some other important concepts like "?rif alternately translated as "Gnostiker" and "Erkenner" of which only the latter appears in the A.I.; "Gehorsam" (?da) mentioned in the text and in the A.I. without reference to its Arabic counterpart, " Huldwunder " (kar?ma), "Furcht" (khawf) etc. This means that the reader is forced to base himself exclusively on the German text and its complex terminology, while those inclined to stick to the Arabic original(s) and not very familiar with German, may find the Sendschreiben a hard nut to crack. The translation, as mentioned above, is almost flawless and one cannot help admiring Gramlich's painstaking efforts to make his text accessible not only for the specialists in the field, but for all those interested in the history of Sufism and Islam. Some small points, however, should be noted. I think that the word "Vermenschlichung" for theological tashb?h (see O. 12 and the A.I.) is useful as a sort of "shorthand" employed by specialists well-read in Muslim theological literature. But it may be somewhat misleading to a considerable part of the translator's intended audience, because " anthropomorphism " is but one aspect of the Arabic term that might have been rendered by a less definite "likening". Sometimes I felt that the translation is slightly too literal and thus puzzling. For example, the phrase (21.3) "die Gewissheit besteht darin, dass das Innerste die Gesetze der verborgenen Dinge (ahk?m al mughayyab?t) wirklich erfasst", might have been less vague, had the translator rendered ahk?m as "characteristics", or "properties". Such an interpretation is common in the kal?m tradition (see, for example, how this term is treated by Richard Frank), which, as we know, was ardently supported by the author of al-Ris?la. These points, as well as some others not mentioned here, are altogether insignificant when measured against Gramlich's extraordinary achievement. However, one last observation should be made. The rendering into German of both al-Suhrawardfs 'Aw?rif al-md?rif and al Qushayrfs al-Ris?la is based on some uncritical (and unsatisfactory) oriental editions, as well as on a number of randomly selected manuscripts. As regards the Sendschreiben, one may notice that Gr?mlich often relies upon the Arabic text published together with al-Ans?rfs commentary on the margin of al-'Ar?sfs supracommentary (B?l?q, a.h. 1290). Moreover, one may have an impression, partly confirmed by the translator's own words (e.g. see "Vorwort" and E 18), that this publication served him as the main starting point in his choice of plausible readings. The reviewer must confess, that not all of them seem equally valid and can be contested. That's where</page><page sequence="3">388 REVIEWS OF BOOKS the lack of critical text is urgently even, painfully felt. From a strictly academic point of view, a critical edition of al-Ris?la as the first step is more logical than its translation founded on rather precarious textological ground. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that most scholars and the general public will welcome the latter and enormously benefit from the translator's labours. So, he must accept our congratulations and sincere gratitude. One wonders what S?fi writing will attract the scholar's attention next? Will it be Abu Talib al-Makk?, or al-Sarr?j?
