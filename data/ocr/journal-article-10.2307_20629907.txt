His publications in English include Toward a Social Production of the Sacred (1977), An Alternative Sociology (1979), Max Weber and the Destiny of Reason (1982), and A Theology for Atheists (forthcoming) as well as articles in Social Research and Praxis International.</page><page sequence="3">Preface This book is the middle term?as it were, the connection or link, hence "weak" in its concrete significance?between two other works which were intended to open and close, according to a problematic and therefore basically provisional point of view, the discourse on the social production of the sacred. The first vol ume, A Theology for Atheists, has the thankless task in the trilogy of being the pars destruens. It performs its negative critical purpose as regards a triple target, by demonstrating the end of Christian dualism, the crisis of the Enlightenment individual, and the insurmountable one-sidedness of the Marxist construct. It is scarcely necessary to note that we are dealing with ' 'ingredients" basic for the formation of the self-awareness of what is common ly identified as "the modern world." In the general plan of this project the third volume {After Christianity) seems on the other hand marked, if the strength needed to complete it is sufficient, by a propositional purpose. It attempts to disclose and aims to identify the elements common to the historical religions, those which seem to be grouped on the basis of their transcendant unity, and which justify on the histori cal but also on the prophetic level the current powerful demand for ecumenism. This demand, in the short term, certainly can be bureaucratically controlled and thereby suppressed by disciplin ary means. However, it does not cease, as far as can be seen, to have an obscure influence day after day, and on the world scale, behind the rigid facade of official orthodoxies. It seems to us that hope is entrusted to it, just as we see linked to it the practical possibility of the survival of humanity in the precarious nuclear condition in which we live today. F. F. 3</page><page sequence="4">Prologue Lay and Levitic, profane and inaccessible, pure and impure, rational and irrational, commercial and not-for-sale, everyday and unusual, fascinating and terrible?the sacred is present in these antinomies. It lives by these contraditions but does not submit to them. It stands above them and dominates them. The sacred is that which is not profane, the inaccessible, what is beyond the walls; but it is also the sustenance, what gives to the walls their profound meaning, their function and at the same time their functionality. The sacred is the forbidden, the uncrossable boundary, but it is also that which gives the meaning of the ultimate significances, those on which commercial transactions do not impinge but which?for this very reason?make the latter possible. The sacred is thus the prohibited, but it also goes be yond prohibition; it is its positive reverse. It is translated and revealed in the desire for the new and what is outside the every day, it betrays its presence in the nostalgia for the lost community, in the long search for an impossible return to the happy realm of the Mothers, the Golden Age when milk and honey flowed. The sacred is thus a threat to the grey prudence of the everyday, but it is also a promise of a fuller, richer, more livable life. The sacred is the toad everyone bears within him as though it were nothing, trying to maintain composure. It does not seem apposite to speak about its return, because in fact it was never eliminated; it was simply presented in false clothing. However, it is well known that what is deep prefers to be masked. The sacred is the wound, the daily stroke of the file which does not allow us to forget, by making history, the end of history, the bliss or the loss of fulfill ment. In tempore finis?complebitur visio. 4</page><page sequence="5">I. Signs from Beyond 1. The return of mystery An eclipse of the sacred was talked about at one time. People thought of industrialization as though it were a great, ruthless flatiron. Urbanization was considered a diabolical mechanism of dechristianization. It was assumed that industrialization had dis solved the "miraculous" mentality, the sense of mystery, the fascination and fear of the beyond. Nothing of this was true. The sacred is with us. Man's landing on the moon has not appreciably lessened the mystery of Heaven and Earth. Strange "unidenti fied" objects continue to streak across the sky and populate the heavenly vault. "UFology" is now a "science," with its special ists, its scholars and accredited interpreters, its impassioned fol lowers and its visionaries. Newspapers still related eyewitness stories which in their candid innocence and miraculous normality match those once told by Bernadette Soubirous about the Madon na of Lourdes. For example: "... It would have been eleven o'clock yesterday evening. I was sitting outside the house with my friends. I looked up and saw a round, white light, very close, streaking through the sky. It came from over there (and she pointed to the bottom of the valley, toward Chiavari). What a strange falling star, I thought." Paria, a woman of seventy-seven, speaks thus about the "great mystery" of the meteorite?or something else??which landed in a wood at Dercogna, on the outskirts of Davagna, 400 meters above and a couple of kilometers from Genoa, where the Val Trebbia divides from the Fontanabuona. Half a kilometer further down, in a clearing prepared for installation of a sewer, remain 5</page><page sequence="6">6 FRANCO FERRAROTTI the traces of the "mystery." A charred tree-stump, some square meters of ashes, and an unmistakable smell of burning. However, there is no hole in the ground and no other trace which could confirm that it was a meteorite. Guido Migliorini, an employee of the hospital at Zuarto, says: ' T was going down the road on Ribot, my horse. I take him out in the evening, because by day the cars annoy him. After the bend, Ribot reared up. Some moments later a white sphere landed down below. The dogs in the houses down there never stopped barking. I alerted the people in the village, where there was a bocce tournament. We were all there looking?about fifty people altogether. From time to time from the clearing there burst out little flashes, like embers under the ashes, which dissolved in the air, burning themselves out in a second. The phenomenon lasted for almost two hours." At three in the morning the firemen were still there, and later that morning they returned. The story, broadcast by news agencies and the radio, permitted many to see an occasion for good public ity. Rather than being frightened, the local people seemed satis fied that they were in some way being "discovered." Everyone, young and old, had something to say. Something really had hap pened, but what, no one knows. The experts are unruffled. "In fact, in the second half of August," says the scholar Mauro Valtolina, "the Earth is very close to the asteroid zone. Meteors fall, following an oblique trajectory, as in this case. In short, conditions are favorable to the fall of meteorites. However, it is strange that there was no depres sion in the earth, that is, unless the meteor was right at its end." Some traces, some burnt fragments, were in fact left. However, it seems that a couple of lads who arrived early in the morning? "uFology nuts"?took them away. In fact, in Davagna the fasci nation of the mystery remains, as does that of the nightwatchman kidnapped by ufos two years ago in a neighboring village. The signs multiply. When everything seems rosy and the great private sentiments are triumphant, when writers rediscover the</page><page sequence="7">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 7 syllabary and the simple language of the everyday, and one even quickly arrives at the level of equating this coupling to a great "revolution of two," there explodes the case of Guyana with more than 900 suicides, the Falklands war and that in the Leba non. The idyllic everyday conceals dramatic tensions. Behind the thin film of highly rigorous technical rationality, there slumber and simmer impulses and deep urges which current rationality is unable to understand and so restricts itself to denying and repress ing them. It is not only New York which offers the context, the setting, for films like "Rosemary's Baby." Turin?a rational, geometri cal city, capital of the motorcar, symbol of technical civilization and its triumphs?is also a capital of black masses, Satanic rites, and magic. Its Egyptian museum, perhaps the most important in the world after that of Cairo, is spoken of as a strange, mysterious meeting place. ' 'Turin is neither a small nor a large metropolis,'' it has been noted: "Baroque and modern, vanguard of material ism in the light of day. However, its second face is magical and esoteric. It is a magic city par excellence, where white and black magic have been present and balanced for millennia. It is the white apex of a triangle of positive forces which extend from Turin to Lyons and Prague. The apex of the black triangle with London and Chicago."1 It is said that if the first city in the world for Satanic cults is London, with its 70,000 Satanists, Turin is close behind, with a good 40,000; and if one took account of the cities' relative popu lations and the number of Satan worshipers per capita, Turin would lead the world. Turin's Satanists are not united, however. They are divided into three churches, which in turn break down into an assortment of sects with different rituals and liturgies. The first church is a precise reversal of the Christian church, a kind of upturned Christianity and Catholicism in which Satan stands and acts in place of God. The Simia Dei. The second church, by contrast, attempts to obtain material benefits and special favors for its faithful. The third church evidences a pro cess of degeneration, its "Black Mass" having become for the most part an orgiastic celebration based on sex and drugs.</page><page sequence="8">8 FRANCO FERRAR0TT1 2. The defeat of rational calculation The second millennium is nearing its end. The twentieth century will probably be remembered as the century of technology and its successes, from the controlled splitting of the atom to the landing on the moon. But it will also be remembered as the century of two world wars, an absolute historical novelty, and the atom bomb, the first real threat to the physical survival of mankind. The century of science and its practical application ends in this way paradoxically: with questioning of the stars, and need for new solidarities, a reevaluation of the meaning of the mysterious, of religion and the sacred, from which the false prophets of irre sponsible optimism and the traders in Eros swiftly profit. The scientific century par excellence thus moves to its close with the position of science being overturned. Far from dominating the mysterious, science is being subordinated to it. Consider, for example, the project of so-called Transcendental Meditation. The leadership of the Transcendental Meditation movement tends to ignore its typically religious origins and to stress instead its technical characteristics. As we know, Transcen dental Meditation basically consists in the attempt to reduce stress by inducing a state of internal tranquility and serenity through concentration on a key word, the mantra. In the view of the Indian master, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (who first introduced Transcendental Meditation into the United States in California, and thence to Europe), the human mind is comparable to an ocean, very troubled on the surface but peaceful in its depths. To resolve the problem of the modern world, above all so as to reduce the state of anxiety of contemporary man, the basic thing is to help man to attain the "silent abysses of the mind," according to the Maharishi.2 To this end, one has to lead the subject toward a mental activity of quietness which the daily rush of thought does not have the power to disturb. Little by little, the meditator can arrive at the "root" of his thought, at its source. He will arrive at this through contemplation of the mantras, defined also as</page><page sequence="9">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 9 "thought-sounds," or "thoughts whose effects are known." What is striking in the teaching of Transcendental Meditation is the insistence on the process of refinement of one's own spiritu al self-possession as a technique, autonomous from any religious background, able to be practiced like any applied formula, equipped with suitable methods of use. Not only this, it also is striking that Transcendental Meditation promises certain results, borne out by statistical investigations and scientific checks, and that it should offer its services to individuals, firms, political bodies, and governments in respect of a multiplicity of problems, from common crime to suicide, alcoholism, and drugs. A similar program of individual and social emancipation is characteristic of the projects of another Indian master, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Asked about the conditions for being recognized as a disciple of his organization, he replies: You say you don't want to become a number, but you already are a number. The question is not whether to become a name or a number or not; you are already a name, you are already a number. It is as though a person in a hypnotic state were to say that he does not want to allow himself to be hypnotised. San nyas is a process of dehypnosis. The hypnotised person must become de-hypnotised. . . . Society hypnotises you, the church hypnotises you, parents hypnotise you. All this has already taken place, it has been a long process of hypnosis. Now, one must move in the opposite direction and subject oneself to a period of de-hypnosis. Sannyas means liberation from everything which has been forced upon us. Sannyas is a counterprocess. Sannyas is not a new program. The orange, the mala, and the new name are only a gesture, a means of express ing the fact that you are ready to throw away all programs, a gesture on your part that you are open to me. It is only a gesture. For this reason it is easy. Anyone can take my San nyas, without conditions.3 Here contemporary industrial society, technically organized and based on rational calculation, the society which refers to science</page><page sequence="10">10 FRANCO FERRAROTTI as its legitimating basis, is depicted as a hypnotizing, irrational force from which to be liberated. 3. Death as a technical accident One might say that we are dealing with oriental phenomena, distant and irrelevant to our everyday existence, if not with fleet ing fashions or exotic infatuations. However, it is difficult to get rid of the suspicion that things are not that simple. The sense of death has returned, and with it the taste for questions which might have been said to have been buried forever beneath scientistic certainty and "factuality." Theoretical and practical progress seemed to leave no time for consideration of death, which (though from the point of view of the individual concerned it is certainly a dramatic and "terminal" situation) was inscribed under the heading reserved for "technical accidents," neither more nor less than a banal power-outage. There is no more satisfaction in the bland, enticing irony of those who chronicle the oddities of Californians seemingly unwilling to abandon their "dear departed" to the scarcely respectful attentions of the earth and worms, to the traditional grave, which, with a kind of distrib utive justice at the cosmic level, restores dust to dust. Irony seems to have lost its efficacy as exorcism. The smile is extin guished in a grimace of loss. It remains as a sign of the times, a variation of the obvious loss to which an economy and a society seem to be condemned, though for a while they had crossed the threshold of mere subsistence. Until very recently, questions concerning the meaning of death and the immortality of the soul once the last breath has been exhaled seemed to have a vaguely medieval flavor, unworthy of modern man and a free spirit. At most, there was permitted a reflection on the Tusculanan Meditations of Cicero, in which the notion of the immortality of man was drawn from the empirically statable fact that man is the only animal in the world who plants trees whose fruits he will probably not be able to enjoy. This is philology rather than wisdom about life. It is a linguistic</page><page sequence="11">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 11 hedonism, satisfied in the clear source of Ciceronian concinnitas, rather than an ethical admonishment for everyday practice. For contemporary man, reflections on this theme rapidly take on hues of melancholy and uncertainly. He thinks with uncon scious nostalgia that a thousand years ago, death had a precise significance as everything had significance. The world was gov erned by supreme certainties, no matter they were true or false. Why? Because death and life went forward together. The beyond and the 4 'out there'' went hand-in-hand. Death was only an aspect of life. It was denied to be the end, the terminus, but was account ed as a rite of passage, a continuation, a path: a path between one life and another, between earthly life and heavenly life, a passage uniting heaven and earth, world and over-world. Today, the situation appears radically changed. There are no longer certainties. Ideals and the great ethical reference points have been destroyed. Human activities have been removed from the domination of the great rules of revealed religion. They have become autonomous and specialized. In a word, they are "eman cipated. '' However, along the way they have also been exposed to doubt. They have lost their certainty; daily they must reproduce the terms of their legitimacy. One no longer dies as once upon a time. Certainly one dies, as all animals die, but the human does not die with serenity, the tranquil naturalness (which Lucretius and Leopardi envied) of other animals. One dies outside both the natural order of animals and the divine order, the warm bosom, maternally secure, of the great orthodoxies. Death has become a banal accident, to be hidden or disposed of in a hurry, without too much fuss. We have not been able to create men in accord with the hopes and programs of the authors of the October Revolution. We have not been able to dream up substitutes for the angels, those "intermediate beings" who were believed to accompany the corpse to its final des tination. In the face of the crisis of theology and the depressing spectacle of death as something become trivial, it might seem that we could solicit aid only from aesthetics. But then there is Dr. Raymond A.</page><page sequence="12">12 FRANCO FERRAR0TT1 Moody, who has demonstrated that rare virtue which one might call the courage of banality. He has applied the methodological rules of empirical research to the study of the ' 'life beyond life.'' On the question of immortality he has collected the evidence of those who, in many cases after having been declared clinically dead, have "returned." What these people, restored to life, have to tell us demon strates disconcerting similarities. Many state that they heard the doctor or someone else pronounce them dead, and that they then felt a great sense of peace and quietness, accompanied by sounds like a metallic clanging or a whistling of wind; they found them selves in a kind of dark corridor or tunnel from which one rose toward another, different situation; and further to have been able to watch, to see their own body from without, as one might observe an abandoned husk. In all the evidence there is present the sense of a limit, a boundary which separates two worlds, two spheres. One of Dr. Moody's witnesses says: "I 'died' of a heart attack and while I was 'dying' I found myself in a field. It was beautiful, and everything was bright green, a green not found on Earth. There was light?a beauti ful, uplifting light?surrounding me. I looked around in the field and saw a hedge. I began to go toward the hedge and saw a man on the other side; he approached as if to meet me. I wanted to reach him, but I felt myself dragged backwards, irresistibly, and in that moment I saw the man, too, turn and go back in the opposite direction, away from the hedge."4 In Moody's view, this evidence demonstrates that the attitude toward death is changing. Men today are tending to return to belief in the beyond. Moody is in this regard fairly apodictic: The reason why death no longer terrifies, lies ... in the fact that there are no more doubts about survival after physical death. One is no longer dealing with an abstract possibility, but an experienced fact. You will remember that I have spoken of the concept of ' 'annulment" in which death is compared to</page><page sequence="13">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 13 sleep, or oblivion. 4'Dead" people do not accept these defini tions but choose analogies in which death is rather seen as transition from one state to another, or as the entrance to a higher grade of consciousness or life. One woman, who was greeted by relatives already dead, equated death with a home coming. Others compared it with psychologically positive con ditions, like awakening, passing an exam, or escaping from prison.5 4. Cosmic migration This last observation is interesting. Together with the thought of death and its "humanization," as it were, today in the average social awareness there grows the need for escape; there is a sense of a constriction which is at once physical and spiritual. The psychology of the man hemmed-in is spreading?the man on whom the sky is closing in, who needs to make himself scarce; the man who feels the need for great, limitless horizons, and the attraction, powerful and mysterious, of the silence of the stars and of the deserts. Jung discussed the significance of the "things we see in the sky" from the perspective of collective psychology. There is no doubt that a very strong sense of claustrophobia is bound to weigh on a polluted and overpopulated world, whose capacity for natural self-cleansing is now exhausted in ever wider areas, and from whose bowels there flows only foamy water, fatally poisoned by detergents and other chemical substances and no longer drinkable. It is only natural that this feeling of claustrophobia and of siege prompts people to attempt migrations through space, to seek refuge in other galaxies. Astrology is regnant. To consult the stars becomes as important and common as obtaining a passport. As trology is the astronomy and the geography of tomorrow. Demand for it grows. Even the disinterested observer and the occasional visitor to bookshops knows that there is a strong, growing interest in astrology. In Italy the revue Astra, modestly defined as "a monthly of astrology and paranormal sciences," systematically enlarges its circulation and manages to organize conventions and</page><page sequence="14">14 FRANCO FERRAROTT1 tours with great success. The heterogeneous, socially composite, and culturally very fragmented nature of its readership is striking, and so, for that matter, is the tough competition it faces from periodicals like Gli arcani and // giornale del misteri. Astrology even affects mass custom, and not only its followers. In the 4 'Roman Summer'' of 1982?a revised and updated version of the classical "bread and circuses" organized by the Assessor of Culture of the Commune of Rome?an astrological event was the high point of interest, with the "Magi's Morning." 5. Consulting the stars It is a fact that according to reliable estimates there are about 2,000 astrologers at work in Italy, doing business which exceeds 40 billion lire a year. The striking fact is their distribution throughout the country. They seem to be concentrated in the technically more advanced and industrially more developed areas, where rationality ought to be higher and more widespread. Pure superstition? Perhaps. But despite the exertions to show the slender reliability of interpretations and predictions on the basis of a reading of the stars, the lovers of astrology multiply and readers of the morning papers anxiously peruse their own daily horoscope. The research on this question reported by Edgar Morin and his collaborators in The Return of the Astrologers has perhaps not received all the attention it deserves.6 The book has nothing of the merely capricious about it. It evokes problems and themes of pure moral theology. It sets up assonances and analo gies which are in some respects disquieting. It speaks of "a mass confessional," it describes and elaborates symbols which, while linked on the one hand to psychoanalysis, on the other hand directly involve the esoteric and suggest comparisons with magic. There is no doubt that astrology in its time was crushed by Catholic theology, lay rationalism, and scientific empiricism. Now there seems certain to be a contemporary emergence of a 44new gnosis," "a body of beliefs which have, as a common</page><page sequence="15">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 15 denominator, a magical echo, extraneous and hostile to Western positivist, scientistic tradition." 6. The end of the dichotomous vision It seems that the dichotomous vision of the world, as split into two clearly opposing spheres, one rational and the other irrational, can no longer be upheld with the serenity of the past. The fact is that magic is present in our society, and it is no longer?if we agree that it ever was?a more or less ' 'residual" element on the way to disappearance. ... On the contrary, if one thinks of the process of "rationalization" and hence of "de-magicalization" in which, according to Max We ber, ... the passage of contemporary society consisted, one would say that now we are decisively passing to a new phase of both social and spiritual life in the West. The ideology of "disenchantment" increasingly often makes itself heard. Post industrial and post-modern society yields to the magic fruit of increasingly disquieting silence, rediscovers (and perhaps does this "from the left") so-called "negative thought," and aban dons itself to the fascination of the penseurs maudits, rereads Nietzsche, Huysmans, Meyrink, Poe, Bulgakov. The cinema and the theatre devote themselves increasingly to dionysiac themes; and young people (and even some not-so-young) move toward the bewitching paradises of drugs or the mystical hori zons of oriental religions. Is post-industrial society thus em barking on the path toward a culture of "reincarnation"? And, if so, to what extent, and why?7 These are serious and significant questions.8 Some concepts, like that of "post-industrial" society, consist of formulations which are more suggestive than theoretically well-founded. The explanation of Weber's concept of Entzauberung, or "disen chantment," is approximate, but the extenuating elements here must be fully recognized, as it is the Weber specialists them selves who now endow him with a simplistic acceptance which is</page><page sequence="16">16 FRANCO FERRAROTTI external and basically misleading.9 The fact remains that the magical tendencies of which we are speaking indicate confirm able phenomena and to varying extents phenomena significant in modern societies which believe themselves technically advanced and essentially based on rational calculation. Morin theorizes on a series of attempts at conciliation of sci ence with the occult. With his customary magnanimity and verbal felicity he discusses a variety of theses, from original scientism to the spiritualist project, from evolution as an ascent to evolution as the illumination directed toward the super- and ultra-human. Certainly, in all astrological schools, belief in and acceptance of a spiritual life have tendencies and emphases of an optimistic na ture, in clear contrast with the witch culture which has today returned to fashion, in the light of feminist emancipation, but which historically is saturated with gloomy flashes and sinister magic. It is hard to overemphasize the negative connotations which bear on the woman, the witch or potential witch, for the whole of patristics, in scholastics and in general in the teaching of the Church. This should not surprise us too much. Is woman not perhaps the gateway to sin, the being which has a natural affinity with lust, the occasion and instrument of the Fall? In Proverbs there is a portrait of woman as a passionate and insatiable being inclined to "frolic" with devils?characteristics which were to return, updated and reinforced, in witches. Lustful, infected, adulterous and fornicating, not only sexually insatiable, but fur thermore able to provoke sterility and impotence in the men they decide to annihilate, witches are basically defined by the power they exercise not only on pleasure, but on the possibility of pro creation?that is, on life itself.10 In comparison, astrologers run the risk of appearing to be the priests of the obvious, if not the messengers of good humor. If things go badly, one should have the patience to wait: sooner or later they will get better. A negative cycle will be followed by one that is certainly better. The passage of a planet with damaging influences will be followed by one of a benign influence, and so on. Nor are individual problems overlooked. The classifications</page><page sequence="17">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 17 and categories?such as love, health, and work?are ones without specific references, which run unconstrainedly through the var ious social classes. The line proposed by astrologers is that of a quiet, sober, and judicious acceptance of given circumstances. Does the economic situation look unfavorable? All right. The individual subject is warmly advised to bear this in mind: for example, to not sign contracts, to keep away from financial spec ulation, and to give particular attention to income and expendi ture. Is the erotico-sentimental situation promising? The subject is encouraged to enjoy it, albeit with some caution, without let ting himself be swept away by the propitious moment, and with out putting at risk more stable links and more secure associations. Success and happiness are ends which can be achieved when one basically knows, through astrology, one's own most intimate self as well as that of the people with whom one enters into relations. One may act, or abstain from acting, according to the starry conjunction. But again, recourse to astrology can assist certain difficult decisions, and even carry to a positive solution situations which have appeared unresolvable. This facile optimism seems to prevail both when we are dealing with astrology for the uninitiat ed, the mass, in which aspects of direct aid dominate, and when we are dealing with a "rich" astrology targeted at a more de manding and refined public with grander economic needs. In this case there will be astrological forms which have greater recourse to scientific aids and language, used, however, in a subaltern manner and often arbitrarily. However, it is important to stress once again how the whole edifice of astrology rests on a symbolic universe which refers to an ultimate reality, or a framework of a general order, which it is possible to approach by way of progres sive approximations, by levels and stages of a frankly esoteric value. 7. Esoteric valency I think it is well-founded to believe that "esoteric valency" is today gaining ground especially through the mass media. It would</page><page sequence="18">18 FRANCO FERRAROTTI be wrong to consider films like "Star Wars" or "Close Encoun ters of the Third Kind" with the typical presumption of the specialist, as mere escapist spectacles. A deeper examination might reveal a meaning which calls in question the spirit of the time. Never as clearly as today does one observe the proliferation of rites, sects, religious and quasireligious groups, paramysties, and neo-Pentecostals. Big and little gurus, some obscure, others preceded by an established and cleverly orchestrated fame, "Children of God," "Moonies," charismatics more or less di rectly linked to the rustic tradition of local holy-men, magicians, and healers of various kinds, now enjoy the regard of the press and there is no bookshop without at least one well-stocked shelf with "UFOlogical" literature. There is reason for surprise, and cause for modesty, when we think that only a few years ago there was concern about an imminent eclipse of the sacred in industrial societies and in all the areas of the world dominated by rational calculation and charac terized by technico-scientific progress. Well-accredited sociolo gists like Peter L. Berger, and scholars of pastoral work like Gabriel Le Bras, not to mention a legion of their collaborators and disciples, expressed observations as sorrowful as they were? now we can say this?off the mark. The phrase ' 'the eclipse of the sacred" is echoed as the prevision of an inevitable and sinister event in many circles, a prevision whose pathos, noted before, was probably exaggerated in a confusion between Catholic Chris tian religious practice and religious practice as such. It was a diagnostic error caused by what cultural anthropologists and eth nologists call the "ethnocentric syndrome" or the tendency to make every possible human value coincide with one's own par ticular values, so as to reduce religion to a church religion and the creed of one's own specific church, to deny the values of other cultures, stamped and canceled out as "barbarisms" rejected as mystifying, and ultimately to prohibit the understanding of religi osity as an expression of internal impulses and intimate needs in the individual. This type of confusion and gross reduction (which is fairly</page><page sequence="19">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 19 widespread in Italian culture, historically deprived of the basic experience of the Protestant Reformation) has certainly aggravat ed the analytical mistake. It has led to the mistaking of the deser tion of the churches and the drying up of religious practice for a definite symptom of the fall of religiosity in the absolute sense. It has helped to stimulate a warning cry on the "mechanisms of dechristianization.'' 8. Religion and religiosity The confusion between church religion and religiosity as a deep, debureaucratized personal experience hindered a recognition that not only was the supposed "eclipse of the sacred" not taking place, but that there was rather an undoubted growth of need for religion and community, and that now we are witnessing the flourishing and growing "social production of the sacred." The hypothesis that the level of development of a given society in the technico-scientific sense must be in inverse proportion to the idea and practice of the mystical or sacred experience in its varied aspects and its innumerable forms, seems today broadly un founded. Rather, there emerges, as an argument worthy of further inves tigation, the function of religious or parareligious practices and rites which are being diffused not so much and not only as forms of cultural survival or, as the paleo-positivists and ingenuous rationalists believed, as residues of superstition, but on the con trary as expressions of a need for salvation and justification in precisely the most technically advanced societies, the United States and the European countries. This is an obvious fact which can be denied only with difficulty. Furthermore, explanations of these neomystical and parareligious phenomena in countries technically in the vanguard, when they are restricted to their purely intimate terms and those of individual salvation, cannot be called satisfying. In my view, one must establish the really social and structural connections which characterize them and provide them with a function of "psychic repair," as it were, especially</page><page sequence="20">20 FRANCO FERRAROTTI for those classes and social groups which industrial development, particularly where it is most advanced, seems now to condemn if not to extinction, certainly to marginality and irrelevance as autonomous social entities. It is from this perspective that there clearly emerges a mystify ing function of certain revivals of a religious and parareligious type. The hoped-for passage from the sacred to the mystical runs the risk of being transposed into the transition from the mystical to mystification. Clearly, the possibility of living an intense and genuine religious experience on the level of individual awareness is not here called into question. Rather, there here emerge the limits of an operation presented as the reply to a need for religious renewal, while in fact it hinders the necessary taking of rational decisions and logical political choices.</page><page sequence="21">II. The Wind of the Spirit 1. The bishops' "cry of pain" The return of what we have generically termed "esoteric valen cy" could be easily dismissed and judged to be irrelevant as phenomena of exotic infatuation, especially colorful ones in the case of movements of oriental origin whose life is as short as it is noisy. However, we have already observed that we are not dealing only with momentary infatuations linked to the capricious breezes of the taste of anonymous masses. One must also note the exis tence of carefully structured organizations with regular fi nances?considerable ones, apparently?resting on theories and techniques which, though their advocates never tire of condemn ing the limits of the pure scientific standpoint, do not desist from taking on tones and assurance so apodictic as to recall the general rigidly dogmatic outlook which formerly was typical of scientism. In particular, one should note that in the Catholic Church itself, traditionally so resistant to gnostic experiences and so jealous of its organizational and hierarchical prerogatives as to have in the course of the last decades conducted severe campaigns against "groups of the base" and "dissenting Catholics," Cardinal Leon-Joseph Suenens has recently opened up gaps which are of great interest to "neo-Pentecostalism" in a perspective of Chris tian ecumenism which is supposed to herald the unification of all the churches bound to evangelical teaching. It is scarcely neces sary to mention the extraordinary impact which this event would acquire by way of the healing of historical wounds and in the 21</page><page sequence="22">22 FRANCO FERRAROTTI framework of an age which shows itself increasingly character ized by a high grade of synchronic interdependence and in which the planetary dimension has ceased to be an abstraction by mak ing itself a daily experience and sentiment. 2. The new Pentecost One might say that the masculine temperament of Pope John Paul II, Wojtyla, which not even the assassination of attempt of 1981 has dented, even if one can see a certain flagging, goes admirably with the theorization and practice of the new pentecostal spirit. Charismatic renewal, which this spirit supports, is of clear ecu menical origin. But although it is rather clearly distinct from classic Pentacostalism, as Cardinal Suenens authoritatively ob serves, the current charismatic renewal refers back to the former, which has its origins in a modest house in Topeka, Kansas, and the prayers of the Methodist pastor Charles F. Parham. Through the disciples of Parham, and especially in the work of the black pastor William J. Seymour, founder of the "Azusa Street Renewal," the movement has developed and taken on a special physiognomy, though its promoters have no intention of creating a new sect and have chosen to remain rooted in their churches, faithful to the ecumenical approach which aims at overcoming, with a universalistic enthusiasm, all churches, sects, and sector alizing denominations. Historically, it has been the hostility of the traditional churches which has pushed the classic Pentecostalists to identify them selves as a specific movement, to win ground in the Protestant world and even to penetrate the Catholic world. Cardinal Suenens explains: Undoubtedly, the Renewal did not manifest itself simulta neously everywhere. Half a century was necessary before, following the experience of the small community of Charles Parham, this spiritual renewal could affect the "historical" churches, the Episcopalian in California from 1958, the</page><page sequence="23">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 23 Lutheran in the United States in 1962, the Presbyterian in 1962, and finally in 1967 the Roman Catholic Church and some Orthodox communities. We are dealing with an ecumenical fact of which we are only beginning to measure the importance and novelty.1 Cardinal Suenens is clearly concerned to make this charismatic renewal in its new forms rejoin the officially sanctioned attitudes of the Catholic Church. The texts to which he refers are unsur prising: those of the second Vatican Council. In particular, he quotes the Council's decree Unitatis reintegratio, and sees a prophetic inspiration in the exhortations this decree addresses to Catholics, that they open up themselves to the appeals of the Holy Spirit toward the "separated brethren." The fear that this inter pretation might lead to suspicions, in even the most futuristic and universalist impulses of the Holy Spirit, of purely proselytizing purposes, logically to be included in the traditional policy of strengthening the might of the Roman Church, seems to leave him wholly indifferent. In this regard he restricts himself to noting that it is precisely to Christians touched with the wind of the spirit that one owes one of the most impressive ecumenical demonstra tions of recent times: that of Kansas City in July 1977, when at least 50,000 Christians met together, half of whom?the Cardinal notes?were Catholics, in an atmosphere of lively brotherhood. "There is not yet full communion, and the problems pending were not yet clearly faced; however, a new climate produced a deep hope of reconciliation in the bosom of the people of God. "2 It is perhaps significant that the movement should begin in California, where the degree of religious fragmentation is strik ing and sects and myths abound and proliferate. Success appears slower and more difficult in Europe. In Italy not much is known of it, except that here, too, the movement spread with an impres sive swiftness, almost so as to disprove the traditional notion of the ' 'Middle Italian'' as basically cynical, indifferent to the ' 'ulti mate questions" and obstinately a Catholic atheist. At the end of 1980 those who regularly attended charismatic groups numbered</page><page sequence="24">24 FRANCO FERRAROTTI 30,000, divided into 450 groups. They managed to overcome ancient distrusts. They confirmed themselves as an important element of official Catholicism. Periodic seminars, impressive national conferences, and a pontifical audience seemed to con solidate this position. From the point of view of social composi tion, charismatic groups may seem first the privileged meeting place of the middle social strata?white-collar workers, magis trates, teachers, businessmen and the like; but in the districts of the urban periphery their membership is certainly broad. Offi cially, the charismatics boast of recruiting their proselytes in all social classes, street cleaners to university professors. Some characteristics have been empirically demonstrated. Women are prevalent; frequently entire families take part; the percentage of young people is significant. 3. The propagandistic exploitation of the crisis of the "external world" The literature produced by the charismatic movement must be read and interpreted in depth if one is to understand the attitudes and aims of the phenomenon. I do not believe that content analysis is sufficient except by way of a first approximation. The organ of the movement in Italy is the review Alleluya. In it we can read both the fairly refined articles of theologians and the witnessings of simple proselytes. The theologians make clear reference to the biblical tradition and to the role therein of prophesy and to the relationship, often difficult and dramatic, between the prophet and the community. The prophet cannot in fact demand obedi ence; he reaches beyond and even against the existing bureaucrat ic legal ordinances. His mission lies in "bearing witness." The theologian of the Italian charismatics is Domenico Grasso, of the Gregorian University. His works bring out a double re quirement: to base and legitimate the position of the prophet and the function of prophecy in the context of a religion as typically hierarchical as the Catholic, and to make plain that the prophetic moment is not a characteristic exclusively of the initial phase of</page><page sequence="25">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 25 the Church. What strikes one, even in a cursory reading of Alle luya, both in the contributions of the theologians and in the witnessings, is the importance of the figure of the leader as the one who is endowed with special charisms and prophetic visions, and who, precisely for this reason, is endowed with the functions of direction and leadership. The leader of the charismatic group is not necessarily a priest; recall that the movement arises precisely to supplement the defi ciencies of the traditional clergy. But how, then, does the relation ship between leader and the social base of the movement appear? Here there is a cluster of contradictions. The charisma of the individual, though it is to be encouraged, is channeled into the aims of consolidation of the group; it is a moment of extreme fluidity which must be induced to return to the institution. The charismatic movement here shows its characteristic ambiv alence/bivalence. While on one hand it presents itself as a lively, attractive movement, a renewed Catholicism, on the other hand, the ever-present risk of a totalizing sectarianism, magical and miraculist, must be constantly exorcised?as stressed by the Pope in audiences granted to the charismatics. The movement's review tries to perform this complicated and delicate function. The rul ing group also presents itself as the leadership of the movement, whether we are dealing with the more commonly known names of theologians whose contributions are more regular and specifical ly concern the relations of concordance and membership with the Church, or with theologians relatively extraneous in the sense that they write occasionally and sporadically, dealing with arguments which are more difficult for the context of Catholic orthodoxy. In a certain way, different dynamics and particular attitudes are to some extent brought together in a single framework in which the process of selection and the identification of what is good, and what is not, directly concerns the Catholic Church. Thus, the motives of the specificity of the charismatic experi ence in the context of the theology of the Holy Spirit, of charisma and its possible valencies, whether as function of the individual personality of the individual believer, or of the group, are</page><page sequence="26">26 FRANCO FERRAROTTI interconnected and frequently recur. Also by reason of this com plexity of dynamics, Alleluya?like some writings of Italian theo logians who back the movement?seems to be concerned with reinforcing and consolidating the belief of the faithful, rather than with external propaganda. At any rate, the external world is presented as a world in crisis due to the liberalization of sexual habits, the crisis of male and female roles, and widespread crimi nality. The main paths to follow are to abandon oneself to the Holy Spirit, to reject a rationalist attitude, to practice charisms, possibly experienced in a communitarian environment, to aban don roles prescribed by society, and to search for absolute values. One goal which should be stressed in comparison with other communities and recent groups is noninsistence on the necessity of a distancing from the family. On the contrary, there is an attempt to involve the family as a whole, in profound contrast to the practice of such movements as Hare Krishna or the Moonies. On the other hand, the conception of science is predominantly negative, without even the instrumental use to which it is put in certain movements of Indian or other non-European origin. This is true even if, given the type of social strata involved, one does not arrive at the level of catastrophe and irrationalist invective which is to be seen in the pronouncements of some individual charismatics, around whom there are formed spontaneous groups in a most fluid manner. The richness of empirical forms in which the charismatic movement manifests itself makes the task of offering a sufficient ly broad and mature interpretation of it, and setting out an expli catory or predictive model in which all the empirically significant dimensions are logically involved, particularly difficult. Howev er, the construction of such a model appears to be an urgent task. In the first instance, one must note?and not for the first time that the neo-charismatic movement, by its simple presence, ex plodes the simplistic theory of a progressive secularization. Sec ond?and this point has also been abundantly expressed?the neo charismatic movement points to the persistence of the sacred in a technicized and rationalized world, and, moreover, the limits</page><page sequence="27">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 27 of the classic theories concerning the religious phenomenon from Marx to Freud. 4. Explanation of the phenomenon What seems more difficult is the sociological literature; the ex planation of the charismatic phenomenon in the terms of, and within the dynamics of, modern industrial society. Let us here consider briefly three interpretative Schemas.3 According to Jean Seguy,4 it would be misleading to speak of the phenomenon in terms of functionalism, nor can one interpret it in a perspective related to Durkheim's position on anomie. He sees in the movement precise historical references, and feels he must specially relate it to pietism. Seguy's basic theory is that the charismatic movement is presented as one of the possible ways in which Anglo-Saxon Protestantism faced up to social and cultural changes in terms of "restoration." Since in the context of neo Pentecostalism one departs from individual sanctification, he sees in this a strong element of ambiguity. In fact, on one side the Protestant pastor is the guide so that each may have their own individual charisms. On the other hand, because he belongs to a specific hierarchical and institutional order, he has to watch that he does not go too far beyond this. In Seguy's judgment, in the Protestant area the movement thus refers to expressions of protest by individuals belonging to relatively high, cultured strata who confront the new cultural models proposed by the universities. Thus, the reference back would be to a problem of power and authority. In Catholic terms, on the other hand, Seguy suggests an interpretation which rests on the supposed large numbers of the upper strata, and the search for authority on the part of lay university members and some members of the clergy, who are faced with the changes initiated by Vatican II. Thus, an important position is given by him to the role of intellectuals. Seguy's analysis, which seems plausible from many points of view, especially as regards bringing out the ambiguity of the movement (the individual-institutional relationship), does not</page><page sequence="28">28 FRANCO FERRAROTTI seem to give full weight to some data emerging from the studies I have carried out in Southern-Central Italy. According to these results, the neo-Pentecostal movement performs?even if not mainly?a function of recognition not only as regards the redis tribution of power but, rather, social prestige, and the compensa tion in religious terms for loss of effective economic and political weight. Also without referring to the Durkheimian concept of anomie?and in this one can certainly agree with Seguy?there seems no doubt that the neo-charismatics present the opportunity for certain groups to escape historical irrelevance, to in some way count for something once again. Another interpretation which offers points of great interest is Andre Godin's.5 He stresses the properly psychological aspects of the charismatic experience. This should not be viewed in the sense of an attempted psychologization of the phenomenon. Rath er, the point of Godin's study lies in drawing to one's attention the standpoint of the subject or the charismatic individual, who can not be simplistically considered by others (among these, in his view, Seguy and Deconchy) as the passive locus in which extra subjective social dynamisms meet and cross. This reference is certainly important in that it is the presupposition for the exact phenomenological description of the way in which charisms ap pear, a mode which necessarily has its basis in the behavior of the subject: glossalalia, regression toward nonlanguage, prayers and giving up of thanks, experience of the presence of grace, witness ings, the question of the lost or refound ego, etc. In this perspec tive, the suggestion of analysis of this subjective behavior by way of the method of "autobiographical conversations" seems espe cially interesting. We see these linked to Smelser's model, ex pressed and followed especially by Luckmann as the "sociologi cal method of biographical analysis." In this regard, we may see how the adoption of the biographical method can help not only the analysis of the neo-charismatic movement but, in a much broader perspective, the methodological and basic renewal of the social sciences. Finally, from the research of Jean-Pierre Hiernaux, Jean</page><page sequence="29">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 29 Remy, and others, we find interesting proposals of abstract mod els hypothesized from a series of documentations and field re search. Thus one might distinguish a traditional or ascetic model in which there predominate aspects of "man" such as adhesion to certain moral rules, mystical practices, sacrifices, etc., as against those typical aspects of "animality" such as yielding to pleasure, letting oneself go on free will. The model is supposed to hinge on such concepts as the optimal distancing from the out side/city, toward the internal recovery of the village, the past, belief, the adult state, etc. This model would prevail in a narrow economy, as the hierarchical ladder would come to be based on an essential "quality of being." In this framework, God is con ceived as the regulator and guarantor. The "religious agents" are those who transmit the moral rule and look after its observance. In general, one might speak of bodily mortification in favor of the spirit. The second model hypothesized here is the so-called promo tional one, in which all the aspects of the complex human reality are to be considered as positive in themselves. The divisions soul/body, spirit/nature, etc., collapse. The life project proposed here refers to the full realization of one's own potentialities. Characteristic features thus come to be belief in a continuous progress, openness to the external, and insertion in a system of production and consumption of economically advanced societies. In the third place, a charismatic model is proposed which would borrow elements from the preceding models, and in which one would aspire to a "fullness of oneself," to be reestablished rather than to be pursued through abandonment, submission, passivity, serenity, peace, etc. The subject would reject any pro motional logic. He would not have a real life project beyond that of the "restoration of the self." According to these authors, "charismatic conversion" could be considered as a rite of pas sage. The realities as referents would be the group understood as a mediator, prayer, and abandonment. The model is presented with ambiguous characteristics, so much so that it could be taken by some as innovatory. The last type of model examined is</page><page sequence="30">30 FRANCO FERRAROTTI ultimately the "sociopolitical" one. It will be sufficient to remark how the charismatic model proposed here is based on many features brought out in the relevant studies, and demonstrates accepted characteristics. It remains to be pointed out that "charismatic conversion" cannot always be considered by itself as a rite of passage, as the "bap tism of the spirit" is reached after a certain preparation in which there intrude a series of withdrawals and meetings and does not always at the same time achieve the emission of gifts and char isms. Further, the problem of relations and the administration of power within the charismatic group, just as outside, is still not touched upon. A critical reading of the positions taken up in the face of the phenomenon leads to an outlook which hinges on four principal dimensions: 1. the subjective dimension, which cannot be eliminated in that charisma makes its appearance in the individual and is essen tially graspable with the biographic method; 2. the charismatic movement as a challenge to the power of the officially constituted hierarchy (a challenge thence variously composed and co-opted according to the logic of the routinization of charisma and its progressive bureaucratization); 3. the recourse to reasonings of an irrationalist kind, such as the stress on emotionality and miraculous effects, encouragement of abandonment to the Holy Spirit, space conceded to the leader, etc., and the ahistorical acceptance of the division of tasks ac cording to stereotyped and undisputed roles as a moment of basic ambiguity in the movement, which, however, make it more ac ceptable by the ecclesiastical hierarchy; 4. the function of compensation, and hence of reequilibration of relations between socially differentiated groups, in favor of strata and classes in decline as a result of structural changes produced by the process of industrialization. A standpoint of this kind perhaps allows one to grasp the phenomenon both in its important morphological aspects and as lived subjectively, and with regard to its institutional dynamic.</page><page sequence="31">III. Reason against Itself 1. The crisis of scientific rationality In its reductive meaning, scientific rationality has defeated itself. Having accurately defined the field of research with the purpose of confirming its own certainties, and by eliminating as mere superstitions or irrational residues any knowledge which did not seem to it open to precise measurement or purely quantitative verification, scientific rationality has ended up by undergoing a drastic impoverishment. It has finished by being technically per fect and humanly deprived of meaning. It has no longer either the courage or, perhaps, the ability or imagination to pose the basic questions. With a neurotic obsessiveness, it restricts itself to checking the internal correctness of its own operations. It decides through procedure. Thus, science has lapsed into scientism. Ra tionalistic reason has burnt its bridges with the everyday. In the name of absolute rationalism it has ceased to be reasonable. It has been turned into a new dogmatism. However, daily life continues. Questions and disquiets multi ply. The twentieth century is hurrying toward its end. Signs are awaited. Christ's lapidary phrase, almost contemptuous, comes to mind: "This generation looks for a sign . . . There will be no other sign given save that of Jonah." It is probable that this last fifth of the twentieth century, the century of technique, of the controlled splitting of the atom and of the moon-landing, will be remembered as the age of astrology, of meta-scientific mysteries, and life beyond life. Contrary to what the enlightenment and its not-always-aware modern followers believed, the gap between rational and irratio nal has not only not been broadened, but has in fact become 31</page><page sequence="32">32 FRANCO FERRAROTTI uncertain. This is not so much the unexpected result of a "dialec tics of englightenment," about which Horkheimer and Adorno wrote. It is rather the increasing awareness that not everything which is empirically unverifiable is necessarily pure superstition, and that, moreover, superstition itself refers to a world of tradi tional knowledge, of customary behavior and of need for existen tial significance legitimated by a double basic function: psycho logical assurance and cognitive data as a technique of survival. This awareness cannot be said to be satisfied by the notion prevailing today of the crisis of classical scientific rationality. This, in fact, is another "internal" conception of the crisis. In other words, scientific rationality is believed to be in crisis be cause it is no longer able, if it ever was, to dispense "laws" with universal validity, necessary and necessitating, according to a rigorous causal schema, and thus able to explain exhaustively the phenomena being explored. In the framework of this argument, the theory of relativity and the principle of indeterminacy are the essential reference points. Nor are we dealing with the "crisis" of European sciences theorized by Edmund Husserl. It is true that "the debate on physical science" between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, discussed under the rubric of "the crisis of the sciences," marks the crisis of the traditional image according to which scientific theories are destined to explain natural phe nomena through schemes of a logical and compelling nature in conformity with the so-called "natural laws of thought." There was insistence on saying that the principles of physical theory " must be defined and justified in terms of rational evidence. . . . By putting in question the abstract and a priori Schemas, relativ istic theory has restored many degrees of freedom to intellectual conduct and the scientific imagination."1 However, the question goes beyond the republic of scholars. It concerns average opinion. It has a social value in the real sense. It had been presumed that with the unstoppable progress of the sciences, the division between culture as reality and rational acquisition, and religion as the area of mystery and the "sacred" must be considered exhausted and that between religion and</page><page sequence="33">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 33 culture there must thus necessarily open a breach; and that fur thermore, as a direct consequence, with the march of progress and the ever renewed victories of science, the sacred should now be considered definitively in decline, near to death and victim of an irreversible eclipse. 2. The supposed eclipse of the sacred In view of the available data, never has a "scientific" prediction seemed so hasty.2 Not only are we not dealing with an eclipse of the sacred, but it is, rather, rationalistic reason which has entered into deep crisis and is demonstrating probably insurmountable limits. If the scope of research should not be unduly restricted on the basis of the "ethnocentric syndrome" referred to earlier, it appears that neither the sacred, nor religion understood as the structure established for its ' 'administration,'' can be said to be in crisis or in "eclipse." Rather, the opposite is true. However, in this regard the doubts, expressed by careful observers of the religious phenomenon in the contemporary world, concerning the somewhat improvised, not to say extempore, character of many modern theories about the so-called ' 'revival" of the sacred are to be taken seriously.3 It is undeniable that many socio-psychological and anthropolo gico-cultural studies appear affected by what I call the herd instinct; that is to say, they operate and are developed not on the basis of a profound, problematic core which thus necessitates them as obligatory and not chance movements, but rather they obey the cultural fashions of the moment and their capricious excitability, more sensitive to the commercial needs of the market than to those of a precise theoretical framework. It so happened that in the current intellectual debate?both on the rigorous con ceptual level of the specialized reviews and on the more catchy one of the dailies and weeklies?the dilemma was many times confronted: Crisis or revival of the sacred? Which of these two theories is confirmed by the facts?</page><page sequence="34">34 FRANCO FERRAROTTI In reality, neither the one nor the other. The famous cry of alarm concerning a supposed eclipse of the sacred in industrial civilization has been shown to be one as evocative as it is ground less. The sacred does not return, but for the simple reason that it was never eclipsed; indeed it was and remained at the center of the legitimating support of various forms of power?political, social, cultural, and economic.4 It is a fact of great importance which should be noted and explored, that what happened accom panying modern, greater mobility, both vertical and horizontal, in large human groups, is a profound evolution of the values which as a motivating framework govern social behavior. Alarm over the supposed crisis of the sacred according to this analytical perspective appears as the defensive and extra-scientific reaction of those social groups which, faced with the growth of new forms of religion, in particular as personal religiosity and noninstitu tionalized community, glimpse the decline of religion as bureau cratized ritualism and power structure.5 The phenomenon of the persistence of the sacred and the social function of religion deserves a more in-depth examination. From the first publication of some studies on Weber,61 have tried to set down the strong points but also the weaknesses and limits of classical rationalism in terms both of Enlightenment reason and of the Marxist approach. In this perspective, Weber naturally emerges in his tortured striving, at once Calvinist and neo-stoic, as the ideal witness of the crisis of the European consciousness, intrinsically linked in its own historical formation to a rational calculation aimed at the exorcism of what is not reducible to a mathematically demonstrable quantity and therefore logically constricted to confine itself to the internal checking of its own operations (technico-formal rationality according to the schema of the means-end relationship). It has or cannot have anything to say, meanwhile, about its own ends, their desirability or undesira bility; that is to say, about the collective aims of social action in which, in specific historic contexts, human co-existence is pres ent (substantial rationality). Missing this basic distinction has led even careful and methodologically well-endowed analysts to</page><page sequence="35">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 35 believe that with the progress of technology, and the moderniza tion and industrialization of society, the sacred would tend to narrow its area and enter a phase of eclipse. We have already noted that the analytical and interpretative mistake was here linked to a double perspective which was se verely limiting: a) in the first place, there was a tendency to make "sacred" and "religious," or the sacred and its administrative hierocratic apparatus, coincide; b) in the second place, there was a tendency to equate church religion with religiosity in the per sonal sense and as an intimate, subjective experience. This necessarily meant, as a hermeneutic consequence, that if external religious practice in the sense of the empirically observ able frequency of observing the sacraments, etc., was in decline, one had to deduce that the sacred was in crisis, while one could reasonably hypothesize that it was precisely the decline of "ex ternal" religious practice which indicated a powerful emergence of a self-managed, or at least different, sacred. 3. The theory of secularization This analytical and interpretative error found its most unrelenting expression in the theory of secularization. The theory is of obvi ous Weberian ancestry, but it is curious that the term "secular ized" should be found in Weber only once, when he is concerned with the consequences of the centralization of religion in the Temple of Jerusalem. Weber's influence on the formulation of the concept of secularization should rather be looked for in his analy ses of the process of laicization of the "profession," its evolution from religious vocation to civil practice, more or less qualified if also "sanctified" by the methodical life; and further in the pro cess of routinization of' 'charisma,'' which from being * 'an afflu ence of grace" and a "special quality" that splits the continuity of the existing situation by beginning a new phase and a new legitimacy, tends to cool down, as it were, by freezing into a bureaucratic structure regulated by the impersonal norm and by a "charisma" no longer personal but rather official.</page><page sequence="36">36 FRANCO FERRAROTTI It is probable that Weber's position has been misunderstood by contemporary authors concerned with the theory of seculariza tion. What in Weber is presented as globally interrelated and dynamically developing, as an ensemble of aspects of social activ ity, which interact and reciprocally condition themselves so as to not legitimate any priority for economics over ethics, or ethics over economics (to limit ourselves to a summary and crude char acterization), in the more hasty commentators seems fragmented. For them the sense of that contextual globalness is irremediably lost and we have fallen to the common fallacy of affected histori cism. In other words, historical development, especially in mod ern Europe since the Enlightenment, if not the Reformation, and later with the genesis and the progressive affirmation of industrial capitalism, has been simplistically conceived as a unilinear se quence of stages or levels rigorously set out according to a diach ronic schema for which, from the beginning of rational calcula tion and the subsequent crisis of the medieval world dominated by the Church, step by step one would necessarily have to pass to rationalization and thus to the fall of the artisan and peasant world, thence to urbanization and in general to modernization, to the division of labor and the specialization of tasks, to an increas ingly exaggerated technicization, to the autonomization of the more important social institutions, rejection of all transcendence and the decline of the sacred and the influence of religion and the churches on society. It is scarcely necessary to note that this conception amounts to a basic distortion of Weber's position, which does not appear reducible to a simplified historicist schema, given that it is open and logically tied to a conception of history as "historic life" in the broadest sense. Contrary to what some of his recent inter preters believe, it is true that for Weber the process of social rationalization is a global social process that involves the "disen chantment of the world,'' but this is not to be understood to mean that the modern world is by definition "desacralized." Probably at the root of the theory of secularization there are confusions both linguistic and substantive, of a certain serious ness. Further, as we have already stressed, one should note that, if</page><page sequence="37">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 37 erroneous conclusions are to be avoided, the perspective of analy sis should be maintained in terms basically broader than the normal Eurocentric outlook. One should look with care, system atically, at what happens on other continents and in other cul tures?without expecting each time a startling event like the mass suicide at the People's Temple in Guyana, which in any case, although it took place in the jungle of Guyana, began in the State of California. Then one notes that the "God Boom" in different forms is in full development. This boom is so strong that it rapidly arrived at paradox. From Nietzsche onwards it has been stated with some facility that "God is dead," but God is so little dead that there is impulsively growing a huge, interconnected "theology of the death of God." It is a fact that terms and concepts tend irrespectively to equate themselves and in reality hide differences and even radical con trasts by means of an elusive convergence. Religion, the sacred, and the divine do not point to the same realities. They move on different levels and obey incompatible logics. In its hierocratic form, religion is the expression of the administration of the sa cred. The sacred is contrasted to the profane, but it does not necessarily have need of the divine. One might say that the more religion gains as a structure of power and center of economic interests and socio-political influence, the more the area of the sacred contracts. The field of the religious and the field of the sacred do not necessarily coincide. With good evidence, one probably could maintain that when the need, or the ' 'hunger,'' for the sacred increases, then organized religion declines. The para dox is that organized religion is intimately desacralizing and that the pure experience of the sacred, even in its relation with the divine, is blocked rather than helped by the religious hierocracy. One would need hypothetically to conclude that there is not an eclipse of the sacred but of religion, more precisely of church religion. 4. Hunger for the sacred The authors of the thesis of the eclipse of the sacred have failed to</page><page sequence="38">38 FRANCO FERRAROTTI perceive a phenomenon of primary importance which today has world dimensions and moves through different creeds and reli gions: the "hunger" for the sacred. What lies behind this hun ger? What is the deep meaning of the growing "need for re ligion," which many today speak of, having recourse to an im precise and misleading formula? The explanation of the religious phenomenon provided for us by Enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century paleo-posi tivism explains nothing because it lacks the very object of expla nation. In any case, it is no longer sufficient. Aside from any historiographical canon, whether apologetic or iconoclastic, we must turn to the classics in order critically to reappropriate their teaching. The relations between reason, scientific rationality, and subjectivity must be reexplored, and therewith the concept of religion and of experience of the sacred as an individual and social fact from Luther to Hegel, Marx, Weber, D?rkheim, and Freud, up to the most recent currents of "social Christianity." Undoubtedly there are deficiencies and crudities which must be analyzed, understood, and called by their right name. For example, the concept Marx adopts for the religious phe nomenon, from his doctoral dissertation, to "The Jewish Ques tion," and after, is no longer acceptable in its entirety. Religion is not only by itself a superstructure, nor are we only dealing with a residuum of superstition to be eliminated by revolution and the consequent profound transformation of economic and social rela tions as Marx wished, or little by little by trusting in time and the diffusion of scientific mental habits as the ' 'free spirits" of the lay bourgeoisie believe. In the sacred there is a collective tension which analysis cannot neglect or leave aside. The criticism of the sacred in scientistic terms is insufficient and contradictory at the same time: it is insufficient because it reduces the problem to the purely psycho logical dimension of faith as credulity; it is contradictory because it proposes to criticize an object whose existence or importance it denies on principle. There is no doubt that the sacred should be demystified. Precisely for this reason, however, it cannot be denied on principle.</page><page sequence="39">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 39 From this point of view, the theory of secularization is a step backwards. It transforms the future perspective into a tearful act of nostalgia. It weeps for the disappearance of the sacred and does not realize that it has it under its own eyes. It does not recognize this because the sacred today loves the mask?as does everything which is deep and at the same time dangerous and vital for man. 5. Scientism as neo-dogmatism and hence as a betrayal of science The recognition of the constitutive and founding element of the sacred does not necessarily involve the devaluation of specialist scientific knowledge. However, it passes through the demystifi cation of scientism, an attitude which amounts to the crude deifi cation of science. It is the projection and also the consequence of an archaic characterological structure which needs to kneel be fore the Prince and pushes to their extreme consequences the new attitudes and mental habits which scientific investigation re quires. Not content with modifying the system of the deductive and a priori reasonings of classical tradition, scientism makes idols of them and freezes them into fetishes. This would not be possible in purely conceptual terms. We are not dealing with an operation of redirection which is purely intellectual and cultural. Society is called in question. The process of deification of science, which from the sixteenth century onwards proceeded within European society, but which already took its first steps in the early Middle Ages, does not correspond to any special illumination of individual scholars shut up in their cells. In the first place it responds to a question, as compelling as it is significant, of the society which is being transformed. The correlated crisis in the fall of traditional crite ria, the new horizons opened by the contacts and paths of commu nications with other unknown continents, the lessening of the basic legitimacy of the powers which, believing themselves eter nal, had made themselves exclusive in social terms, had at first reduced and then literally undermined the ancient legitimating presuppositions of important political and social decisions. Once</page><page sequence="40">40 FRANCO FERRAROTT1 tradition as a source of legitimacy had fallen, to whom could one turn? Where to find a new basis of consensus? Where could one identify a new instrument of self-hearing and self-direction for societies which had for some obscure reason decided to turn their backs on the past and were so adventurous or so imprudent as to enter onto the paths of modernization on a vast scale? Here emerge the cultural foundations of modern industrial societies. It would be too easy to maintain that everything began with some happy mechanical invention, whether the clock as Lewis Mumford believes, or the steam engine according to most people's opinion. It has been fully demonstrated that from the point of view of technical knowledge, classical antiquity could already have begun the process of industrialization on a large scale. If this did not happen it is due to the fact that the quantita tive abundance of consumer goods was not important. Not only this. The practical application of inventions and theoretical dis coveries was generally believed to be dishonorable: it bore the mark of manual contamination. Only a society which had lost its sense of direction, its external and higher parameters or its con stellation of transcendental values?whether we are concerned with Zeus's Olympus or Saint Augustine's City of God is of little importance?and a society which was so proud as to think it could express its own basic values by itself, immanently, and on the basis of absolute self-sufficiency, could discern in science and technology, understood as applied science, the new form and at the same time the fundamental base of its justification and orientation. It is said, moreover with good arguments, that the cultivation of science was an act of homage to God, insofar as it permitted and deepened the study of nature, which was God's own creation. Newton considered God as the Supreme Architect. He is the pantocrator, the creator and guarantor of the cosmic order. How ever, this argument, if it is satisfying from the point of view of abstract theory or in the heat of the scholastic theological discus sion, does not manage to explain the new, emerging conception of truth which is no longer expressible as adaequatio rei et intellec tus, but rather was acquiring an essentially operational value. The</page><page sequence="41">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 41 new scientific truth could no longer be reduced to truth as "rev elation' ' or aletheia in the classical sense, nor yet as "reflection'' or the "fitting of intellect into reality,'' in the manner of scholas tic philosophy and of Aristotelian-Thomist realism. The truth of modern science is not limited to recording or reflecting. It is not satisfied with fitting itself to natural processes by providing them with a kind of negative copy. It proposes to imitate nature and at the same time to invade it, exploit it, and if necessary recreate it by running the risk of denaturalizing it. 6. The humility of the scientist as a tactic Modern science is thus not the reflection of nature but rather its reinvention and in some cases its violation. The humility of the scientist as regards nature is an apparent one?a tactical attitude, almost a technique to disarm the adversary and take him by surprise. It is humility which is preparing the triumph, the truce which precedes the final attack and victory. "Natura nonnisi par endo vincitur," Bacon said, condensing in a single phrase the whole program of modern scientific research, from Galileo to nuclear fission. The power of modern science is there. Its appar ent inevitability and the roots of its power, both organizational and intellectual, roost and root themselves in this context. The greatness of a thinker such as Comte?and, before him, though less clearly, Saint-Simon?lies in having understood the connec tion between science and society through time, the social vocation of science, apparently extra-scientific and -political, and its ten dency to function as a new base of the legitimacy of the social system and inter-individual consensus. It is no surprise that the utilitarian principle in the England of the seventeenth century should emerge as an important main spring and often a decisive factor in scientific progress. Rarely does science appear as itself. It does not permit its real nature as an autonomous and self-propelling movement to leak out; it does not allow that its hubris be revealed in all its potency. As Merton has made clear, the science of origins does not renounce its</page><page sequence="42">42 FRANCO FERRAROTTI apparently vicarious, if not ancillary, function. The sanctification of science found an unexpected reinforcement in the Puritan ethic, which was based on utilitarianism and on the idea that all knowledge should be evaluated, contrary to the wisdom of the classics, on the basis of its utility. In fact, it was thought, every thing which helps to make the life of man happier and less hard is good in the eyes of God. Naturally?and on this point the utilitar ian and Victorian moralities were logical to the point of cruelty? this is to be understood as applying only for all those who deserve it or who pay for their welfare and their "good standing in the community" through methodical daily labor, zeal in undertaking their professional duties, and total dedication to their duty. In this context, science becomes the principal instrument of God. In the Christian Directory, which was to be so important for Max Weber's research into the sociology of religion, Richard Baxter seems to have had no doubt in this regard: Grace will be more clear and comprehensible if you persevere and succeed in your efforts. . . . For true love towards God and towards man, properly that of a heavenly spirit and a holy life, offers itself a marked pleasure and delights whoever gives themself to it: as if a man should find satisfaction in his own culture and his own wisdom by reading some excellent book and meditating on it, or discovering mysterious masterpieces of art or of science, this gives him more satisfaction through the very action itself than does the simple affirmation of his culture in general. What joy do the discoverers of the nautical chart, of magnetic attraction, of the printing-press, of can nons, find in their inventions! What pleasure did Galileo find in his telescopes, in finding irregularities and shadows on the moon; the Medician planets, the sixty-two rings of Saturn, the changes of Venus, the stars of the Milky Way, etc., etc. We are already in the dithyrambic mode, which we shall find in authors and in books as disparate and distant as the Manifesto of the Communist Party of Marx and Engels and The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution of C. P. Snow.</page><page sequence="43">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 43 Today there is an obvious fact which, understandably, Baxter missed. There is in scientific activity an unforeseen consequence to which we can perhaps point as the idealization of precision, the myth of quantified exactitude. It is true that the utilitarian princi ple, and the puritanical morality which backed it up, historically have helped science and its development by seeing in it primarily an instrument "for the greater glory of God.'' However, one must immediately add that the mental habits inculcated by the practice of scientific research and the prevailing mentality which makes its application possible on a vast scale in daily social life tended to stress the basic self-sufficiency of scientific reasoning and the autonomy, not needful of external justifications, of what Veblen was to call "the discipline of the machine." Science, which initially seemed to accept with good grace an instrumental function, did not delay in presenting itself as an end in itself on the basis of a strictly endogenous logic of develop ment. Once the external criteria of judgment had fallen, science became scientism: a public procedure insofar as it was a basis of social consensus?but ethically neutral, available, not averse to selling itself to the highest bidder or whoever might furnish the material needs for carrying out research independently of ends, satisfied with watching over and controlling the internal correct ness of its own operations. 7. Science and power The perfection of science in its scientistic version is thus formal and untouchable from within. It is a perfection without a goal. However, in proposing the despairing objective of an impossible neutrality, science leaves its followers disarmed before the pow erful of the day. As has been nicely observed, Before the State, the man of science is today harmless, natural ly subordinated. In the history of modern science, no heroic acts are recorded. Compare Galileo with Bruno in face of danger. Leonardo already served the Princes with his war</page><page sequence="44">44 FRANCO FERRAROTTI machines. The scientist often claims to live for knowledge. The reality is more modest. We are concerned with the search for a corner in which to feel safe, a defensive attitude in an individ ual of little aggressiveness. It is now late to hope for a reversal of these things. What was obvious for the ancients has not yet occurred to modern scientists: that one must keep knowledge destined to the few quiet, but the formulas and abstract, dan gerous formulations capable of fatal developments, damaging in their application, must be evaluated ahead of time and in all their implications by those who have discovered them, and consequently must be jealously withdrawn and hidden from publicity. Greek science did not arrive at a great technological development because it did not want to reach one. By keeping quiet, science makes the State afraid and is respected by it. The State can live, fight, and be powerful only with the means offered it by culture: it knows this perfectly. The tribal chief is viscerally dependent on the witch-doctor.7 By standing in his hide-out, the man of science hopes to preserve the minimal conditions?those margins of nonrenouncable free dom for the pursuit of his research. To this end he is ready to proclaim his "value-freedom," referring to the term Wertfrei heit, which Weber certainly used, but only in order to prevent certain colleagues from distributing from University chairs their personal opinions as though they were scientific conclusions and hence intersubjectively binding. In the majority of cases, rather, value-freedom becomes the screen for a quietum servitium in which science seems wholly divorced from conscience. The ap parent political and social neutrality of the scientist, his boasted moral indifference, can have a very high price. Proof of this statement is not hard to find. It abounds even in recent history, from the biological and genetic theories, scientifi cally untenable but imposed politically, of Lysenko, the protege of Stalin, to the brutal use of science on the part of the Nazis. According to the Nazi former President of the Danzig Senate, Hermann Rauschning, it is reported that Hitler</page><page sequence="45">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 45 believed science to be a social conquest which could be mea sured only in terms of its impact on the community. The objec tivity of science was only a slogan invented by professors to protect their interests; the idea of disinterested science was absurd. On the contrary, Hitler argued that what was called the crisis of science was simply the fact that those gentlemen grasped by themselves, with their objectivity and autonomy, that they had gone off-track. The simple question which pre cedes every scientific undertaking is: who and what wants to know something? Who wants to orientate himself in the world which surrounds him? It necessarily follows that there can only be a science of a certain type of humanity and a specific era. There is very probably a Nordic science and a national-socialist science, destined to confront liberal-Judaic science which in fact does not anywhere fulfill its function but is now in the process of cancelling itself out on its own.8 8. Against scientistic dogmatism: The return to science as a problematic human undertaking It is curious, on the other hand, how precisely the impossible neutrality which the scientist claims for himself, and which can throw him at the first opportunity into the arms of tyranny, should be at the basis of the process of his canonization. As the scientist prohibits himself from having values and recognizing that scien tific research is none other than a human enterprise, necessarily subject to the imperatives and ethical responsibilities of any hu man enterprise, it is here that the scientist comes out as a kind of lay saint, hero of abnegation if not of the democratic spirit. I have elsewhere drawn attention to this kind of "sanctity," which, however, suggested to thinkers such as Nietzsche the sense of a fundamental affinity with the virtues of the mule who trots straight on, undaunted, on the edge of the ravine, and who does not suffer from giddiness, probably because he has no imagina tion. The technocratic ideology, which functions as a presupposi tion for the sanctity of the man of science, is still widespread</page><page sequence="46">46 FRANCO FERRAROTTI today, notwithstanding the disastrous consequences of a science reduced to technico-specialist competence, which conceives itself as without moral significance. One can express the essence of this ideology in a few remarks. The scientist is rational because he believes, as the ultimate test of truth, in the cause-effect nexus. He does not, as Veblen re marks with his characteristic ambivalence, need a "natural" law or any other-worldly design in order to "gratify his sense of substance.'' In other words, he does not need a mythical, animis tic or anthropomorphic?in any case pre- if not irrational and undemonstrable?network which might in not purely mechanical and quantitative terms justify in his eyes (terms, that is, which would be susceptible to precise measurement) the flux of experi ence, and the (in the last resort) chance series of events. The scientist is thus free as regards emotional prejudices and the cultural idiosyncrasies linked to specific historical contexts. He is "open," by definition, to the new and the different. He has an experimental attitude, a flexible one, which favors interpersonal agreement, promotes understanding. One might say that he is "naturally" democratic and "social," not infected by any politi cal or cultural chauvinism, able to agree with his subordinates, optimistic, and ready to recognize the merits of his colleagues, and so forth. Snow's tone is frankly rhapsodic when he contrasts the mis sionary of the past in the technically backward countries with those whom he considers as today's missionaries: the technicians and the scientists. Many Europeans, from St. Francis Xavier to Schweitzer, dedi cated their life to the Asians and the Africans, nobly but pater nally. These are not the Europeans that the Asians and the Africans will welcome with joy under present-day conditions. They want men who will mix with them as colleagues, who will offer what they know, perform a clear technical task, and will then go away. By good luck, we are dealing with an attitude which is easy for scientists. They are in fact freer than the majority of people of racist sentiments. Their very culture</page><page sequence="47">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 47 in their human relations is democratic. In their internal climate the breeze of equality hits you in the face. At times without regard, as it does in Norway.9 The Norwegian breeze aside, Antonio Gramsci says nothing dif ferent, but indeed attributes to technical education in the special ist sense a primacy still more decisive. "In the modern world, technical education strictly linked to even the most primitive and unqualified industrial labor, ought to form the basis of the new type of intellectual.''10 With greater caution, Veblen speaks in all his books of the "discipline of the machine" and of the sense of circumscribed and empirically verifiable "factuality" which seemed to constitute the attitude of the engineer or the organizer of production, never to be confused with the typical parasite, the business manager or brasseur d'affaires, interested not in the increase in production through the best combination of produc tion factors, but rather in making money off people's backs by profiting from the cycles of the economic situation. In truth no one, engineers and writers included, has the future up his sleeve. It is certain that the future does not depend on simple scientific development. Probably it depends on the capacity of critical glo bal evaluation?that is on an integrated humanistic and scientific culture in which science may rediscover its function as regards the meaning of man without pretending to do this exhaustively. The scientific claim is clearly inadmissible. In fact, it reduces all knowledge to a single, scientific knowledge, seen as a "stipu lated" knowledge on the basis of methodological rules accepted as valid by a given scientific community. At the same time, it forces one to accept that to know means to measure and that moreover what is not exactly measurable or quantifiable is not knowable. Hence the intemporality of science. For the techno cratic ideology and for the scientism to which it relates as to its base, science properly has no history. It presents itself as the final, necessary and necessitating result of successive discoveries which give rise to the accumulation of the partial results, gradual ly achieved on the basis of the principle of self-correctability.</page><page sequence="48">48 FRANCO FERRAROTTI There is no doubt that self-correctability of specific scientific explanations when faced with new data exposed by research is the essential characteristic of the scientific argument and its process. However, scientific explanation does not live in a historical void nor in social isolation. One cannot ignore the fact, without falling into a disembodied and unreal notion of science, that there are also schools, teachers, loyalties, and betrayals by disciples?a whole, various, multiple world of economic and political inter ests which influence science and condition the directions of re search. The evolution of science and scientific thought is not reducible to a series of stages simply tied to new discoveries and their internal logic, to "turn-abouts," to new "paradigms," to use the term of Thomas Kuhn, which is not without ambiguity. The progress of science is not so smooth and "logical" as the scientists would like to have it believed. There is also a history of extrascientific interests, of struggle, of plots, of power, and of blood. The evolution of science and of its critical self-awareness passes through three basic phases, which I shall allow myself briefly to indicate: a) the phase of ingenuous idealization of science as dispenser of "divine" knowledge and the source of "laws," acritically seen as propositions with universal validity, necessary and necessitating; b) the phase of science as a problematic undertaking, no long er the source of an absolute knowledge, but able at the most to arrive at the formulation of tendential uniformities and general izations endowed with a probabilistic validity; c) the phase in which the scientific explanation tends to be presented as a purely causal and conditional explanation, en dowed with a character which is basically operational, in which research, rather than fitting itself to reality or reflecting real processes, tends to present itself as an active, controlled interven tion into reality. It is above all in this last phase that the cult of quantitative decision, and the "quantophrenia" which follows from this,</page><page sequence="49">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 49 reveal fairly crudely their limits and in particular demonstrate those neo-dogmatic aspects which run the risk of making science itself, as a whole, useless, by denying its basic preconditions. The usefulness which critical reflection on the sacred brings to the discussion of science is in this sense decisive. Outside and beyond any dogmatic temptation, it insists on the return of sci ence as the ability of man to place himself in a problematic relation with himself, with other men, and with the universe. The arrogance of the quantomaniacs does not recognize the virtue of equilibrium. They call themselves "tough-minded" as against the sentimentalism of those who hold to values and do not believe it is possible to restrict the context of human knowledge to the point where it coincides with simple quantitative measure ment. Whoever dares to leave the mortgage of the purely quanti tative criterion is stamped as soft-minded. In reality, even with a dispassionate examination of the question, it seems difficult to resist the temptation of applying to the quantomaniacs the defini tion of the idiot savant qui sait tout mais qui ne comprend rien. From Quetelet to the present, the attempt to apply mathematical reasoning and instruments to the study of social phenomena is an attempt which deserves respect: "at a certain point, towards the end of the nineteenth century" writes Viennese ex-socialist Paul Lazarsfeld, "quantification takes on its modern function in the field of sociology?that of translating ideas into empirical oper ations and seeking among the variables thus created some recur rent relationships. A whole series of historical studies on specific techniques will be necessary to clarify this general tendency."11 This is perfectly understandable and acceptable. What one cannot accept is the unmerited narrowing of the concept of meth odology to the point of eliminating from it concepts to make room for the specific techniques of enquiry. Still worse: the mathemati co-statistical instrument is stood on its head as regards its func tions, and from an instrument takes on the role of central support of sociological analysis. Lazarsfeld, put to the test, states that he is not concerned about the metaphysical foundations of his work. Good. However, the doubt arises, as Sorokin never tired of</page><page sequence="50">50 FRANCO FERRAROTTI emphasizing,12 that the theory of knowledge implicit in its re search did not go much beyond a crude gnosiological objectiv ism, if not an unwarily critical ingenuous realism. Even more acute, however, is C. Wright Mills's criticism. Taken up with the concern to measure social phenomena precise ly, and thus concentrating on the methodological-formal aspects of their work, Lazarsfeld and his followers put on one side the great classical tradition of sociological research: they are igno rant of, or put in subordinate order, the basic problems, and elide the historical dimension of social facts. In other words, it does not much matter to them what one ought to analyze and study as long as one studies and analyzes it on the basis of specific procedures and by making use of specific instruments of measurement. Natu rally, this leads Lazarsfeld and his followers, including the most recent ones, to a sovereign indifference in the face of the objects of research, their relative historical importance, their level of social decisiveness, so as to make them social scientists ready to dedicate themselves to any theme so long as one finds a customer prepared to pay expenses. An item is an item. From the decision to buy a certain brand of cigarettes to the decision to start a war or, more simply, to change jobs.13 Scientistic value-freedom still finds today, in the pale followers of quantomania (which in the work of Lazarsfeld had its most recent splendor) its defenders and representatives. Their unconfessed, but logically implicit, ideal is that human beings should flatten themselves out, but above all that they not speak, that they give up their characteristic and damnable unpredictability so as not to disturb the calculator.</page><page sequence="51">IV. The Presence of the Evil One 1. Satan's army We owe the most systematic and complete theoretical elaboration of the number, the locations, the quality and the orders, the science and the power of devils to Thomas Aquinas. The diaboli cal skills are multiple?the ability to unleash storms or the power of winds, to construct bridges and fortifications, and above all to tempt human beings. The privileged areas in the tempting activity of Satan's army are pride and lust. It is not surprising that it is precisely the ascetics, and generally monks, who were the chosen victims of diabolic forces. Howev er, one should note that the close connection between the figure of the Devil and the sexual sphere is reinforced by stories and leg ends relating to the loves and the children of the Devil. Not content with "possession," demons were said to have attempted in every way to couple with earthly women and produce children. This intention gave rise to many disputes on the part of theolo gians and experts on the real possibility of such coupling. Accord ing to St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure, the procedure was com plex. The Devil, himself without sperm, would first have had to have procured it, as a "succubus," so as afterwards to mate as an "incubus" with a woman. Other theologians have hypothesized a concrete amorous passion on the part of certain devils for certain women, possibly eventuating in the dissemination of a peculiarly cold sperm. Through the centuries there have been famous pacts with the Devil, as in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus or Goethe's Faust, but there are also serious defeats for the Devil at the hands of saints like Bernard of Chiaravalle or even of those who were 57</page><page sequence="52">52 FRANCO FERRAROTTI supposed to be his children, such as Luther. Meanwhile, in the progressive rhetoric of ingenuous rationalism, Satan and his court were taken as a symbol of scientific progress and of the rebellion against all tyrannies, or as the "avenging force of reason" to use the phrase of Carducci in the famous Hymn to Satan. 2. Demonology Is the myth of Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of Evil, a thing of the past? It is true that certain contemporary interpretations tend to see Satan as defeated by modern neuropathology and above all psychoanalysis. However, this is perhaps a premature optimism. There is no doubt that the idea of diabolical possession and the related one of exorcism appear seriously weakened, but it is perhaps too early to regard them as completely dissolved. After several decades, certain questions are outstanding con cerning the correctness?or not?of so much optimism about the supposed linear development of this process. The predictions of Mary, appearing at Fatima to three young shepherds, directly concern devilry in connection with high ecclesiastical hierar chies. The Virgin is supposed to have said, "Satan will walk in the midst of their ranks and in Rome there will be great changes.'' Lucia dos Santos remembers the swathe of light emanating from Our Lady's hands, and the vision which was displayed before their eyes: "... and we saw, as it were, a great sea of fire and immersed in this, black and burnt, demons and souls in human form, like transparent embers which then, drawn upwards by the flames let off by the souls themselves, together with clouds of smoke, fell back again on all sides as sparks into the great fires with neither weight nor balance, with cries and lamentations of pain and desperation which were horrifying or made one tremble from terror. The demons were marked by their horrible, digust ing forms, as terrifying, unknown animals, but they were transparent, like black coals in the embers."1</page><page sequence="53">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 53 Fatima is even today widely celebrated. There are many faithful who study the revelations related to the "third secret," not yet placed in the public domain, which Mary was supposed then to have revealed. While there are priests who admit that there are too many pathological states that have been confused with posses sion by the Devil, and also who want to forget (but how is this possible?) the victims of this collective psychosis, women for the most part, is it not also perhaps true that cases of exorcism are found also in our times? That in the capital of Italy Father Ga briele has been at this work for decades is a known fact which at various times has ended up in the national press. In his view there is no lack of devils around. Indeed, there are devils present in such numbers that daily they take this energy and persecute him even beyond the specific moment of exorcism. De Lutiis notes that exponents of traditional Catholicism have actually suggested that Vatican II was inspired by Satan, and in particular quotes Carlo Di Muzio. In Letters from the Other Shore, this writer states that The Devil never lost a word, a gesture, a decision, a difficulty, anything in the Council. Grotesque and majestic, despicable and magnificent, scarlet and dazzling, the Devil watched from a distance the old Pope on the morning of 26 January 1959, at the Basilica of St. Paul's Without Walls, when John XXIII announced the Ecumenical Council. From that moment on, the path of the Council was also his path. Mysteriously present everywhere, he always tried to realize his most cunning strategy.2 But, if I am not mistaken, did not this very text perhaps have a "preface" by Cardinal Luigi Traglia, formerly Vicegerent of Rome and thus the Vicar of the Pope in his diocese? It seems problematic, then, to reduce the problem to a few terrified peasants who might come from the countryside to con sult Father Gabriele (coming from the villages already studied by Ernesto De Martino in his time), as indeed there have been various attempts to make us believe. Besides, even if we were</page><page sequence="54">54 FRANCO FERRAROTTI dealing with a small number of humble people?which in any event is contradicted by the facts?the problem of the matrices of belief in Satan would remain open, especially the problem of the overcoming of forms of emargination and alienation which at least in certain periods and in specific contexts have been and are the substratum of this phenomenon. 3. Witches and magic A historical rereading is essential for the understanding of the various forms that belief in magic has taken, the preconditions which accompanied its development, and the social deficiencies with which, still today, it is predominantly linked. Now it is possible to recognize our relative good luck that there have been periods in which these beliefs were reflected in certainly more vicious behavior. The works of Franco Cardini help to define the terms for a better understanding in this respect. He bases the study of magic in a perspective of "long time-periods," which are "internally mapped by sudden changes, crises and multiple breaks. "3 Cardini notes that it is not magic in itself which should be considered negative, but the type of use which is made of it, and that wizards and witches are for the most part to be seen as emarginated people who suggest other, if not in fact alternative, morals and values regarding the dominant power and the frame work proposed and accepted by the generality of those belonging to a particular society. Hence comes the idea of recourse to the Devil, a pact with the Devil. This interpretation finds an obvious and considerable confirmation in the studies of burnings, whose victims were supposed witches charged with relations with the Evil One. In a recent study Serena Foglia deals with the history of witchcraft and follows the path of its sufferings and deaths. And again, one finds a framework of aberrant dismissals and problems of madness and perversion on the part of the judges, especially raging during the quite sumptuous and schismatic sixteenth cen tury. One of the aspects of demonomania which according to Serena Foglia should be enumerated among the most dramatic</page><page sequence="55">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 55 should be sought in the divergence to be seen between imagina tion and reality.4 As a result of three centuries of persecution, one can point to a very high number of victims, for the most part women (one might speak of genocide), and furthermore a significant penetration of Satanism within the Church. Prostitutes, single women?experts in medicinal herbs easier to obtain and cheaper than official medicines, who possibly turned to drugs and hallucinogens become the predestined victims of distorted mentalities who charge them with supernatural powers like flying, power over the elements, and so forth (powers which, in other contexts, have been accepted in the great saints), and who scrutinize their every word, distorting its meaning, or accuse them for their subsequent protracted silence. Among the first to discuss this collective madness, to put in doubt the correctness and credibility of certain trials and accusa tions, we find the voice of the Sire of Bergerac. Cyrano de Bergerac in fact asks himself why these witches?in his view, actually poor, ignorant, terrorized peasant women, unable to de fend themselves?should have accepted pacts of damnation with the Devil, their presumed Master, obtaining as their whole reward hunger and poverty in life and abandonment at the stake at the moment of death. Who, then, is the witch? According to Serena Foglia: In different social contexts the witch can be . . . considered as belonging to a rival faction; a dangerous deviant from the group; an internal enemy; a being who, for some deep-rooted imperfection, is not accepted as an integral member of the group; the representative of an enemy external to the commu nity itself.5 The analysis of belief in witches and their protector, the Devil, for Foglia refers to a dimension which is not only individual but also of the community, in which an essential role is played by the accusers. It thus refers back to the interactions which are created</page><page sequence="56">56 FRANCO FERRAROTTI between those who believe they are suffering from sorcery and those who believe they are creating it. More contestable in my view is the social framework dealt with. It follows that belief in witches flourishes in those societies in which social interaction is intense, and where the roles of the members are fluid and elastic. Where, on the other hand, this interaction is scarce or spread out, and roles are more precisely defined, the belief disappears. In fact, it would remain to be explained how it is that the phenom enon has been present in agricultural societies in which the roles were decidedly established and in the majority of cases ascribed. At any rate, the division between the imaginary and the real, and above all sexual phobia, are for Foglia at the basis of this double schizophrenia in which the man (hence normally the judge) projects on to the woman as temptress his own contemptu ous and distorted sexuality, while the woman is said to accept the role of "temptress" so as to obtain a certain power, however mediated and uncertain. Certainly the weight of the sex-fearing morality of the Church played a notable role in the formation of certain tendencies and beliefs. And if the Devil in some way was its beneficiary, many, especially women, have paid the price for it. Hence social emargination, differentness, and a sex-fearing morality are the motives which seem to accompany through the centuries belief in the Devil and Satanism. Further witness in this regard is provided by the studies of Alfonso M. di Nola, who has recently returned to the discussion, first with an interesting introduction to certain studies carried out by some of his collaborators in Tuscany,6 and thereafter with a text, The Devil, with the significant subtitle The Demoniac Syn drome as a Threat to Humanity.7 Previously, in his Inquest on the Devil, di Nola linked the persistence of the diabolical syndrome to a closed society in which evil becomes a "destructive and disruptive force." in which a certain obsolescence of certainties and guarantees prevails: to some extent, an "anomic" society. He</page><page sequence="57">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 57 firmly relates this phenomenon to the petit bourgeois strata, which is an interesting attribution inasmuch as we have in general been accustomed to relate it to strata of the subproletariat. Returning to this theme in The Devil, this historian of religion presents a stimulating reconstruction of the Devil in history?in Judaism, in the New Testament, and finally in the Middle Ages. At this point, we pause at possession and exorcisms. It is during the Middle Ages in fact?and in this he is in agreement with the majority of historical interpretations?that "the practice of exor cism took on an exceptional importance both in relation to the extent of the unhealthy conditions which were attributed to dia bolical possession and as a result of the frequent phenomena of collective hysteria and supposed possession."8 Di Nola dwells again on certain combinations: between the Devil and the witch es, the Devil and popular culture. The latter often links him to violent death, brings him close to the use of certain plants, and expresses its respect or fear or amusement in this regard by way of proverbs and so forth. Regarding the persistence of the phe nomenon in the contemporary world, he notes how the recent Satanic churches which have emerged in the United States by way of the trial of Manson and his followers, and which from time to time appear on the daily news, have quite precise historical precedents. Their position should historically be interpreted as originating in specific ideological couches which tend to emarginate movements and currents which con test the model or which, especially in modern times, express serious difficulties of the individual and collective conscience and attempt to experience at a nonelitist level abnormal situa tions of relations with imaginary worlds of power.9 Thus, for example, at the time of Leo XIII and the conflicts with Masonry, the basic reason for the conflict and the demonic conception which at that time the Church had of Masonry should be sought in the tendency on the part of the Church to repress the libertarian attitudes encouraged by Masonry. Continuing his ob servations, he excludes any basic change in the world of the</page><page sequence="58">58 FRANCO FERRAROTTI "subaltern nonurban periphery" in which the demonic tradition had performed a precise and well-founded role. At present "the Devil appears ... as the mythical seat of a decline in the quality of life impoverished in its essential values"; it becomes a "risky ideological situation'' in whose context there still seems space for a personalization of the Devil, with the evident risk of a reconfir mation of the "taste for the demonic" as a moment of the total alienation of the Christian and as a traumatizing exposure of the layman to new possibilities of emargination." 4. The persona of the exorcist In fact, the reassuring message which emerges, along with oth ers, from Herbert Haag's book Belief in the Devil,10 seems now widely dismissed and discounted. Beyond the messages of the last Popes (which of necessity reflected their times, at least in part) and the statements of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued in the institutional Catholic environment, even on the fringes of the Church, both in urban and in agricultural contexts, belief in the Devil seems to be a reality not yet defeated. At times this appears with the customary and traditional charac teristics, at other times with elements of a renewed, sinister fascination. The latter seems to occur more often in an educated, urban environment. In this respect, Malachi Martin's booker the Hand of Satan is indicative. This is not a scholarly work, but evidence from within the Catholic world.11 As a believer, Martin places himself with an internal perspective of concern and under standing for a phenomenon nonetheless accepted. In particular, he is concerned about the figure and work of exorcists, demon strating his full understanding and worry as regards the risks they come up against, precisely because of their activity, from ills both physical and spiritual in type in an obsessive crescendo which calls into question psycho-physical elements as well as faith. The author attempts, from the examples provided, to establish the image of the "figure" of the exorcist. This is most often someone who for a long time has dedicated himself to parish pastoral work</page><page sequence="59">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 59 and the care of souls; rarer is the instance of the theologian and the scholar. Often middle-aged, ordained some decades past, he is marked by a certain common sense and a certain balance. Daily behavior and religious conviction would be characteristic traits, especially as scrutinized in the choice of exorcists (even if the recent rule which enlarges the range of possible priests involved has perhaps helped to produce some changes). Martin thus passes on to the study of certain ' 'cases,'' trying to find in them a passage more or less similar and able to be checked. The phases which thus characterize exorcisms?at least for a major part?would seem to be linked to a * 'presence'' which makes itself felt increasingly sharply until arriving at a ' 'breaking point." The phases during which one hears the "voice" are especially unbearable: this often puts forth the deepest thoughts and facts concerning the one who is possessed, and at times the exorcist himself, until the real "encounter," which may entail considerable violence, including physical, and at best an "expul sion." Martin's book is pervaded by the theme of the risks con nected with these practices, risks which are said to involve who ever is in some way present and involved. In fact, at times the presence of Satan is said to have been frighteningly revealed to some inexpert helpers of the exorcist; blameworthy for not hav ing noticed the climate of tension created and having spoken, reacting on their own behalf and not only in the name of Jesus Christ; blameworthy, perhaps, for not having tolerated silently the harsh, diabolical revelation of their most secret sins. Exor cism would seem to have been tremendously dangerous, obvious ly, for the possessed, because at times the spirit settled in him might wish for the death of the body nurturing him, so as not to be forced to abandon it; and naturally it is dangerous for the exorcist, who impersonates the enemy in that he acts with the power con ferred on him by the Church. The cases chosen from among the many one could cite as examples are particularly interesting. In fact, we are dealing with cases which emerged following spiritual temptations. In this way, little by little, possession would have begun. There are doubts,</page><page sequence="60">60 FRANCO FERRAROTTI perhaps emerging following studies of philosophy, or derived from scientistic attitudes in the anthropological field. In one of these cases the negative reference is to Teilhard de Chardin. Through the breaches opened by scientism and false reasoning there is said to have appeared a progressive insinuation of the "Kingdom" with all its propositions and deceptions. Naturally, the openings may be related to various aspects. Thus the Devil can take advantage of typical features of contemporary disquiet, of the desire to experience abnormal attitudes such as bisexuality or trans-sexuality, or could infiltrate through attempts at penetration into the world of the unknowable, profiting from the arrogance produced by supposed conquests and discoveries in this regard. There is the case of the university professor who is supposed to have tried to return to preceding lives, to dominate and manage paranormal gifts such as second-sight, telepathy, trips outside the body, and similar things. It is pointless to say that in the text the theme of possession stands out as frightening, immediate reality, operative and threatening. If, moreover, one abandons the edu cated environment to which Martin refers, the persistence of the phenomenon of Satanism seems obvious. There is a trace of it in the most recent studies on certain contemporary religious groups and phenomena. Maria Macioti notes how the theme of the Devil, understood as the persistence and personification of evil, is present in the mes sages which certain persons who believe themselves endowed with particular charisms are said to make use of, and which become the "jelling-point" of extra-liturgical cults.12 One of the cases examined is that of Sister Floriana.13 Here, in the diary entries of the Sister, as in the "messages" for which she is supposed to be the go-between, Satan always finds room, and in various guises: as persecutor of the Sister herself, tortured and persecuted for the good that she does, because he hopes to break her will and drive her away from the paths of the Lord; or again, as a cause of the perversion of the contemporary world and hence as the mediated cause of the disturbance which is said to be spreading among the clergy and the ecclesiastical hierarchies. As</page><page sequence="61">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 61 an example of this, certain quotations reported here can be cited: "Do not yield for an instant to tiredness and the Devil who torments you . . . "; "These were two days and two nights which simple words cannot describe. I seemed to have been trampled on. With continual effort I could undertake the most necessary duties"; "God allows that His Creation be often mo lested and tormented, even physically, by the Devil"; "O Lord, you allowed hard days. With your grace I went onward, offering you every step. My whole body seems trampled and every move ment means sharp pains. All this is nothing, thinking of grave sins. ..." Moreover, it is reported that the Devil did not restrict himself to the persecution of the Sister. His prey was the "beings elevated in dignity in the . . . Church,'' as "few from the outside recognize such decay. Everything seems a success, the aposto late . . . Everything built without Me! Fearful void, the triumph of Satan!" Previously, the Lord requested pilgrimages and peni tance. "Now the pride of the Evil One has invaded the Earth and the curse of My Son lies heavily on poor humanity.'' Naturally, this is not a unique case, and similar points can be found, with elements of greater immediacy and crudeness, in the messages attributed to Enzo Alocci, who works at Porto Santo Stephano. In his statements, the evil present in the world is decidedly identified with Satan, defined variously as "The Beast," "The Hungry Beast," "The Infernal Beast," "The In fernal Protector," and so forth. Especially feared are "Satan's rage'' and ' 'the great infernal dragons.'' The correlation between the presence of Satan and earthly catastrophes, past or future, is a constant feature. The following remark may be indicative. Mary is speaking, and it is 16 September 1968: "I ask you only to love each other, to pray and be faithful to your Heavenly Father and to remove yourself from all dangers, as Satan is traducing so many souls and so many ruinations could worsen?wars, famine, ill ness, fierce storms and earthquakes, bringing the world to de struction."14 Everything will go well if we follow the directions of the Madonna. If not, the consequences will be terrible. "You will become beasts like the Devil, and you will be defeated by him</page><page sequence="62">62 FRANCO FERRAROTTI alone and dragged into the abyss forever. Now I bless you, son. Pray and make them pray for whoever lives and rules in the service of the Devil" (9 July 1976). In general the persecutions of the Devil are supposed to have two privileged targets. First, the men of God, the charismatics, the persons who through their sufferings witness in the name of the Lord. In these cases the persecutions can be physical, as demonstrated in the two cases referred to, or also spiritual. The Devil raises doubts and feelings of unworthiness in people close to God, and takes away their tranquility. For example, in the case of Maria Simma, renown for an ability to communicate with souls in Purgatory, the Devil is supposed to have made her believe that this was her illusion and that no soul had been saved through her intercession. Natuzza Evolo and Mother Speranza are classical examples of physical aggressions experienced at the hand of the Devil. For Natuzza Evolo, the intervention of Padre Pio is sup posed to have been necessary so as to relieve her of evil. Rosa Quattrini is supposed to have had warnings concerning the battle in progress today between Michael and Lucifer. The reason for the presence of Satan, in San Damiano as in other places, is linked to that of physical catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, etc.) which hang over mankind. One finds similar signs in the cases recently examined by Miriam Castiglione.15 The basic reason in the cases referred to is that the Devil is linked with doubt, criticism, the lack of an immediate and passive acceptance of the order willed by God and the Church; a weapon to fight submission, humility, acceptance of the lessons taught, sublimination, in some way, of conflicts which are obviously present. In cases of this kind, sexual repression and social emar gination are certainly underlying motives of considerable impor tance. Beyond the individual case and the motivations to which it refers, what is more important to emphasize is the obvious pres ence in the modern world of a belief which one might have supposed had been overcome, which the more advanced Catho lics accept, if at all, in dialectical terms, since good may be born and developed from evil. This is a belief which may take on</page><page sequence="63">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 63 different forms in the city and the countryside, for a peasant or a dockworker, or among the upper bourgeoisie of the Italian North (Bergamo and Turin often come to the notice of the newspapers by way of celebrations with drugs, linked with Satanic rites). However, it by all accounts exists, notwithstanding the progress of science and the development of psychoanalysis, and marks even today the reality of phenomena not fully explainable in scientific terms. 5. The blasphemous inversion and the Dionysean ego The most up-to-date and disinterested historical studies confirm that the Devil is not merely a medieval character. The arguments as set out by Norman Cohn are certainly hard to discount. In his view, the figure of Satan does not appear in the Old Testament. Although he certainly has an explicit role in the Book of Job, there is no doubt that there, Satan acts and speaks as a legitimate member of God's Court whose proposals do not fall outside, still less against, God's design. Further, Cohn notes, We are accustomed to consider the snake which seduced Eve in the Garden of Eden as a masked Satan. However, the text does not at all provide for such an interpretation, given that the - snake is presented as one of the creatures of God, and as such good, and is cursed only after his disastrous intervention and as a result of this. There is no passage in the Old Testament or in the Gospels which authorizes such an identification. Indeed, the first clear indications that the tempter in Paradise was Satan are to be found in noncanonical writings after the first century A.D.16 Satan would therefore be a late creation, corresponding to the idea that there is a whole category of human beings devoted to the service of Satan himself, a sect of his secret worshipers, commit ted to an unrelenting struggle against Christ and the Christians. One understands easily what the latent function of this imaginary</page><page sequence="64">64 FRANCO FERRAROTTI idea might be. It helps to legitimate the harshest persecution, to the point of extermination, of whoever challenges orthodoxy or dares in any practical or doctrinal way to challenge the Church as a hierocratic and political power structure. The basic role of Satan then becomes that of justifying the struggle against the heretics, the movements of protest of the emarginated and those socially excluded, the "witches" and in particular the Jews. In this sense the figure of the Devil has its special modernity. It is a fact that, not discounting the tribulations of the Blessed Cure d'Ars, from the end of the Middle Ages there is a progressive slide from the monstrous to the diabolical. It has been remarked that the end of the Middle Ages involves the gradual evolution from the monstrous towards the diabolical. From the thirteenth cen tury on, oriental devilry saturates the West (cf. the analysis made by J. Baltrusaitis, Le Moyen Age fantastique, Chapter 5). The increasingly sorry characteristics of the dying Middle Ages are added to the aesthetic commitment which is intended to set forth the image of an increasingly pessimistic world . . . The Devil, Woman, the Monster, come together and end up by producing together, or as a couple, a very powerful body. The Devil is a monster, the monster makes himself diabolical whenever possible, and life appears to be permeated by an ever-present, monstrous Devil which makes itself felt on the basis of some kind of apparition.17 This "apparition" is always very lively and through time was consolidated and laid down in "popular consciousness," if we can use this rather problematic concept, and gave rise to a rich flourishing of popular beliefs regarding devils, witches, fairies, magicians, and so forth. We must recognize that the inquisitors had no need to invent anything. Their original contribution was limited to interpreting these popular beliefs as a serious deviation toward the cult of Satan, to the extent of justifying their concep tion of the witch as being anyone?man or woman?who was voluntarily, explicitly involved in the service of Satan. It should</page><page sequence="65">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 65 be noted that at the height of the Reformation, witch-hunters were to be found equally among Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. It may disturb the systematic and doctrinal tidiness of precon stituted categories, but there can be no reasonable doubt regard ing the convinced participation of the Lutherans in the bloody witch-hunts, or for that matter as regards the important role of the Devil in the whole movement of the Reformation. This takes away none of the significance of Lutheranism as a crucial moment of "subjectivization of the rule," but meanwhile it is as well not to confuse doctrinarily the claim of' 'the liberty of the Christian'' in the terms in which it is discussed by Luther, for a concern for individual liberty.18 According to Cohn, the witch-hunt in Eu rope may be said to have finished in the eighteenth century, even if, to moderate a vision which today can seem too optimistic, he hastens to state that' 'the myth of the servants of Satan is not dead, and in the nineteenth century reappeared in a new context as the myth of the world conspiracy of the Jews. ... In the midst of Hitlerian anti-Semitism there is the idea that all Jews for thou sands of years, everywhere, were united in the incessant effort to tempt, subvert, and ultimately dominate the rest of humanity."19 Here, one may stress a notable convergence with Lutheran theology where it holds that the Devil is the Prince of this world, the God of this Earth (princeps mundi, Deus huius saeculi). In all Lutheran teaching, the presence of the Evil One is strong and basic. Not only are sins presented as diabolic manifestations, virtues themselves are demonized. The Devil does not only attack Christianity as a system; he attacks and tries to dominate individ ual Christians who by themselves cannot resist this attack. At the basis of Lutheran desperation there is this inevitable defeat, which can only be remedied through particular homeopathic treatment: pecca fortiter; crede fortius. Paradoxically, it is the decline of the belief in the power of the Devil which comes out as a plausible criterion to measure the decadence of Protestantism. On the other hand, the laicization of the Protestant claim opens the way to the post-Enlightenment conception of the Dionisiac ego. The Witches' Sabbath may well have been traditionally seen</page><page sequence="66">66 FRANCO FERRAROTTI by the inquisitors and their informers as the blasphemous meeting in which a mysterious conventical, with the blessing of darkness, met to worship Satan and to take his instructions for the implaca ble, incessant war on Christians. It is also true that the Sabbath might signify the formation of the new human community, be yond and against the utilitarian demands and the logic of the market: a new synthesis, the orgy as the founding moment of the new participation of the human in the human, the return to the innocence of the Greeks, that people of eternal childhood. These are disconcerting parallels, but ones which have been widely and persuasively analyzed: "Even the imagination of the Sabbath, Black Masses, etc., is one of the forms the Dionysean takes on. It then becomes demoniacal. . . In the fantasy of the Sabbath and the images represented therein, orgiastic ceremonies hold a position of primary importance. A naked woman is wor shiped or a young virgin is ritually deflowered, acts which begin the unbridled debauche dedicated to the God of Evil, to the Devil himself. Precisely as the act of communion euphemistically termed by the Christian Church the "kiss of peace" symbolizes the charitable relation between brothers and sisters, here it is the obscene kiss which marks the demoniacal religion: Obsculum sub cauda."20 The Dionysean ego arises from this madness, from this dereg lement. Dionysean drunkenness is more than drunkenness, it is the rejection of formal logic?predictable logic?in favor of a deeper rationality, of intellectualism in favor of wisdom.</page><page sequence="67">V. The Paradox of the Sacred 1. The interregnum A rational but also reasonable human being, driven by logic but also checked by wisdom?that sense of measurement which re calls Aristotelian sophrosyne?who accepts himself as a spirit but also as flesh and blood: this is the post-Enlightenment and post Christian individual, the human type, the type who most closely resembles the ideal of a complete human being. Historically, this illustrates the basic correction of the Cartesian methodological doubt and its basic conclusion. It is no longer "cogito, ergo sum," but rather: "cogito, ergo sum cogitans." The human existence includes abstract, purely logical thought, but is not exhausted in this. Closed in on itself, the Socratic discovery of the concept changes and is downgraded into conceptuology. It be comes a barrier and a resistance. It abstracts from the living but also loses it from sight. It wanders between ghosts and puppets. Man does not emerge from this enriched, but rather cut down and threatened in his specific existence. One of the most insidious and insistent ways out of the crisis of the historicist tradition arises in proclaiming the dissolution of the individual as Grundkorper, as the kernel of the social dis solved into the multiplicity of his functional interrelations. The very definition of man presented by classical humanism is then duly remolded into one less evocative but apparently more linked to the social process, which sees in man no more than the "con text of the system," the privileged place of interchanges, the flat crossroad of intrasystemic relations, given a destiny by their internal logic, returning after every change, however dramatic, to their conditions of origin. 67</page><page sequence="68">68 FRANCO FERRAROTTI For this reason, the idea of being a complete human being cannot be expressed in modern conditions, when the process of cortical intellectualization seems to have arrived at an advanced stage and has placed its cold hand on the most intimate relation ships; neither by religions in the narrow sense, more concerned with demonstrating rigid and Church-centred dogmas than an emancipatory message, nor by formal social institutions (state, unions, parties). The drama of contemporary violence is that of what is already present, but in a hidden manner and calling out to become visible. Violence is negative, in that it is the interruption of interpersonal discourse, but it has a potentially positive value as an instrument of visibility. What is commonly called "blind" violence is also a choice of the victim, and it is called historic. Who is affected by it is in reality called to the fore, becomes a character, emerges from the anonymous. There is a dialectic of violence still wholly to be explored. In the very moment in which there is killing, violence produces life. This is the old Orphean Pythagoran myth of the snakebite which gives life. For this basic reason, violence cannot be considered, and reduced to, a police problem, as suggested by the conventional wisdom, but neither is it a problem of a merely social nature. When we restrict ourselves to considering its socioeconomic and political roots, we are still inside the problem. Whether it be suicide or homocide, violence seems to link itself to the need of "being in fullness," to the need of a meaningful presence on the part of human beings who do not live but who have lived, and who die before being born. The novelty of the contemporary situation is that they are aware of this. They point obscurely to possibilities which are historically unheard-of. This is not the so called "revolution of rising expectations." This is the crisis which derives from the fact that neither revealed religions, nor consolidated interests and the politico-ideological structures which express and legitimate them, are capable of satisfying positively these possibilities of self-development. Here, the loss of meaning of the political structure has its</page><page sequence="69">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 69 origin. The relation of young people with institutions is instruc tive in this regard. One is not only dealing with rejection or conflict, to be made better with some interim patching up by "social engineering" in a more or less openly technocratic or authoritarian tone, as one says with a certain indulgent superfici ality, even from the orphans of Marxism. Order and disorder, institutions and extra- and anti-institutional space, do not con front each other, and are not extraneous to each other. Rather, it is the diminution, the drying-up of the motive connection of recip rocal "recognition." Hate and violence are still a relationship, even if at times a mortal one. They are still an embrace, however badly calculated. More fatal is indifference. The radical tradi tional individualists, when they believe they can overcome the crisis by realizing to the full the process of individualistic eman cipation, often in a hedonistic, permissive light, do not seem to see that in reality they are privatizing the public, and that the solution of the crisis goes through the apparently paradoxical desubjectivization of the individual. It is here, however, that the sacred shows itself powerfully as religious or as a common connection. 2. Accepting the problem as a problem A few Western thinkers?among them Heidegger?have intuited how the new individuality does not arise through an individualis tic and autonomous project, but rather only to the extent to which one no longer thinks of it but accepts its being thought about. One accepts the interregnum, the moment of attention, stasis for ecsta sy. In other words, one accepts a moment of epoche for the suspension of aggressiveness, acquisitiveness, and technical effi ciency. One thus understands what is enormously difficult today to understand: that important things, profound values, can never be completely (explicitly) enunciated, that the important things are said with a glance, with waiting, with silence.</page><page sequence="70">70 FRANCO FERRAROTTI I see in this regard the great contribution that Eastern thought might be able to provide, in that it is not the thought of a substan tialized Leibnizian ego, as it were, but rather the thought of a thought ego and hence a de-subjectivized one. The new subjectiv ity, which no one can predict in its precise essence, moves through the death of the previous subjectivity and the overturning of related existential attitudes. The very possibility of meanings not tied to the logic of the market is born, if it has reason to be born, on the basis of a fundamental indeterminacy. Unfortunate ly, nothing is now further from the average Western or Eurocen tric mentality than this attitude of the acceptance of the problem as problem. Nothing leads us less to live with the problem without the craving for immediately resolving it?no matter how through the mechanical external application of any formula. I draw this awareness not only from a truly philosophical re flection, but primarily from the gaps in sociological research in the field. Why does it always arrive so belatedly? Why does it never or almost never see the important things, the emerging problems? Why is it reduced to commenting on the obvious? The world has passed from diachronic logic to synchronic logic, and is defined by a co-presence which manifests itself in the multiplic ity of cultures and the plurality of value-sets, harshly rejecting the Plutarchian and elitist tendencies of yesterday's world. However, research continues to proceed and develop according to a typical ly Eurocentric perspective. This logic involves the systematic decline of preformed conceptual frameworks, the categories pre constituted around the human realities to be investigated. What does not come into these categories is canceled out, cut away, left aside as irrelevant. The complexity of the problems which face humanity today is made to suffer from the inadequacy of the conceptual and technical means for studying them. Hence derives the fear of the "new," distrust regarding the "different" and indeed of the involuntariness of thought. It is this fear which makes the West dangerous. It has not managed to have a meaning ful and equal contact with other cultures, on which it projects itself by destroying them. It creates the void where there is the</page><page sequence="71">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 71 ' 'other than itself.''' 'Give me your territory?or your human and material resources?and I will give you the Bible, or alienating productive technology." The West speaks only with its shadow. Its presence, whether in the capitalist form or in the contrary and symmetrical form of bureaucratic collectivism, is only the prem ise for genocide?not necessarily bloody, but rather well-oiled, painless, and technically sophisticated. Eurocentric logic has its persuasive capacity, and claims the collaboration of its own vic tims. Anxious, yearning to achieve Western welfare, these vic tims do not take into account that this welfare will necessarily destroy the reasons for which it is desired: it will create a desert, a desert of neon. The attitude of waiting, necessary in the phase of the interregnum, implies the elaboration of a new scientific meth odology, methodology as a technique of listening. It can no longer hand out precepts, predict, sermonize, make critiques and self criticisms, elaborate new programs?nothing of that. It is here that the limit, the error, of 1968 must be sought. This was an expansive protest which wanted to become a plan and finished by being neither protest nor project. Rather, it was neces sary to block everything, to listen, to wait, to stop life so as to recover it, to reaccustom the ear to listening, to prick up one's internal ear. This is a difficult operation, almost impossible for Western European man. It produces a moment of panic. Then Western man behaves like the hero of a mediocre American film who, faced with a problem, gets up, goes to the window, lights a cigarette, then grabs his trenchcoat and goes out, slamming the door. He does not know how to live with his problem. He does not know how to live it through. 3. Beyond dichotomous reasoning Here lies the importance of the crisis: the crisis must be lived through. This ability is rare. We have been accustomed to think that all problems are technically soluble, and that it is enough to know the formula and apply it. But real human problems are not resolvable once and for all. There are permanent tensions. They</page><page sequence="72">72 FRANCO FERRAROTTI demand a suspension of judgment; listening, acceptance, and waiting. In other words, they demand a religious attitude. Homo religiosus is not a man of a church, he is the man of listening and waiting. He has a more or less infinite capacity for waiting for being to show itself and truly has no other god outside his god, and his god is being, and he does not replace this with the little gods of consumer civilization like the automobile, the refrigera tor, the television, or the computer. Technical rationality has now covered the whole world and is occupying the full horizon of possible rationality. Hence arise the suffocation of the human potential for development, contradic tions which are no longer open to mediation, explosions of violence, and nostalgia for the community. These human beings do not want to die. The meaning does not wish to die. Finding the way out of this great historical crisis is this time not the responsi bility of a charismatic leader, an Old Testament prophet. The crisis makes one suffer, it wounds but at the same time reveals and illuminates. Eastern thought is not in a hurry to resolve crises. It accepts them as part of normality. But the lesson of Eastern thought in Europe has become fashion, an ingredient of the dy namic market of cultural consumption, a style. A radical reorien tation is necessary in order to overcome the division between rational and irrational thought, to turn back. The prevailing methods of reasoning are based on a dichotomy which impover ishes life: tradition and reason, order and disorder, past and future, agrarian and industrial, technical calculation and custom, structure and personality, movement and institution. Never, or too rarely, does the fantasy of understanding the world, not ac cording to a binary framework, in black and white, but as multi dimensional, multiple, many-meaninged, seem to make any headway. Here, then, is the importance of a discussion based on funda mental rationality, the importance of not letting a preconstituted, categorical logic prevail. To the possible objection that this means a return to primitivism, infantilism, or the renunciation of scien tific knowledge, one may reply that science should be recognized</page><page sequence="73">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 73 as having an instrumental, not a final, value. There are many modes of knowledge and perception of the real. The gap between the lived and the thought should be overcome. This should not be done by an immediate existentialization of the theoretical, but for the simple reason that thought, every thought, is such insofar as it is lived. The problem became radical in the West when, with the "industrial revolution," rational logic began to be equated with the quantitatively measurable. At the time of Rabelais it was not so important to know one's date of birth. Vico was mistaken about his year of birth in the Autobiography. We witness a pro gressive increase of quantitative precision and a concomitant, proportional impoverishment of meaning. The tendency to think in terms of preconstituted solutions has been asserted. Thus, problematic consciousness has decreased. In order to limit our concern to celebrated contemporary experience, it seems clear that one of the errors characteristic of the movement of 1968 lay in the belief that struggle against an authoritarian structure implied in itself an alternative structure, essentially nonauthoritarian. The limit of 1968, from this point of view, was a limit typically internal to the world it assailed. It was a very persuasive example of "wishful exploitation." It ended up com ing to terms with the authoritarianism of the fathers by substitut ing for it the authoritarianism of the grandchildren. In this sense, 1968 was a point of arrival rather than a point of departure, as it had been imagined by so many, or at least hoped for. 4. Frustrated youth protest Perhaps one too easily forgets that 1968 was a movement of international significance, at once the instant and the sign that the generation born at the end of the war was reaching maturity. It was only natural that this entrance should take place with the self assuredness, the irreverent certainty and the preemptory demands of those who did not carry within them the remembrance of bombings, the tragedy of civil war, the restrictions of the black out and the ration card. I am well aware that by taking this path</page><page sequence="74">74 FRANCO FERRAROTTI one runs the risk of reducing the discussion of 1968 to a body of gossip about the lost illusions of a generation. However, one cannot deny the evidence. It is a fact that the young people of 1968, even when they spoke in leftist jargon and made a display of ideology, wanted first of all a different, richer, more open life?as was said then, a more "liveable" life. That they had to fall victim to false prophets who exalted the virtues of spontaneity and minimal effort can no longer seriously surprise us. In this sense, the analytical error which snagged even informed and incisive observers is pathetic. Nineteen sixty-eight was not a beginning, a debut, as Alain Touraine might suppose, discerning in it the very sophisticated, theoretical plan of a "Utopian com munism." It was rather the beginning of an end, a protest and a rejection, a decisive "enough with war and its miseries, with work and its burden, with study and its boredom and discipline.'' Naturally, this protest on a world scale took on different color ations and tones in different contexts. American young men re fused to leave for Viet Nam. German youth reacted against an integrated, hyperorganized society lacking basic political opposi tion. In France there was an attack on Gaullist grandeur, while in Italy the principal and most convenient target was academic au thoritarianism. Distinguished in its immediate causes and objec tives, 1968 displayed, however, a basic negative convergence. It was against officialdom and constituted powers: it called them into account and contested their legitimacy. From this point of view there is no doubt that 1968 was a salutary jolt, a signal which the holders of power would be wrong to undervalue even today. In a study conducted together with John Fr?ser,11 think I have persuasively illustrated that 1968 responded among other things to the need of the postwar generation to say "No," to open a gap between ruling classes jealous of their prerogatives and inclined to mistake their functions for exclusive rights, to be transformed into untouchable privileges. However, precisely on account of its basically negative character, the dissent of 1968 apparently so strong, and often so spectacular, did not succeed in making itself a project. It remained a rejection, conflictuality, abstentionism, a</page><page sequence="75">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 75 rumbling. It is hard to withhold one's agreement from Luigi Manconi when he writes that "1968 produced no homogeneous corpus: neither a compact theoretical heritage nor a unitary sys tem of behavior and life-styles nor a coherent political program nor a univocal modus vivendi."2 It is probable that already in this fragmentary nature there was prefigured the variety of paths which the followers of 1968, with greater or lesser fortune, would pursue. Nicola Tranfaglia, look ing for the immediate origins of Italian terrorism, found them in the failure of the center-left and its reformist scheme.3 This argument seems to me a risky one. Considering the social type, the kind of social origin, the family links, the average age, the language and the "vision of the world" of many terrorists, I believe that one must find in them a significant connection with the movement of 1968. There has been talk of a "family album" in the sense that there are precise connections of ancestry and derivation between certain attitudes of global confrontation and terrorism. This is a plausible idea, provided that one takes care to note that family albums are not unilateral; that youth and student confrontation itself, through its unformed ideological character, has been able to produce influences not only to the left but also to the right, among the young people of Autonomia and Pot ere Operaio as among those who later find a place and a refuge in the arms of Communione e Liberazione. This tragic trajectory, from 1968 to terrorism, is still awaiting its Newton. It has yet to be redeemed from the impressions and ideologizing accusations, to be soberly put in historical context and understood in its most profound essence. Then, perhaps, one will understand that this trajectory is related to another, that which many leaders and some of the troops of 1968 have traced for some time, returning to the fold, to the formerly despised traditional political parties, the unions, the universities, and private and public industries. How many Associate and Full Professors, now academically seasoned, conceal under their everyday condescension a passionate 1968 past? And how many directors of enterprises, rising young indus trialists, successful men and women who pronounce now in the</page><page sequence="76">76 FRANCO FERRAROTTI muffled purity of Board Meetings, gave their maiden speeches in stormy open assemblies, servis d'ordre, or processions and dem onstrations, masked, or even armed? 5. The sunset of revolutionary pathos These veterans of 1968 have understood one important thing: that today politics has more need of operational efficiency than revo lutionary pathos. Not only this: that the social question of the nineteenth century type, that on which the Italian political parties still dwell, has been finished for some time; that today no one dies of hunger here, and that the oscillations between' 'right'' and "left" are now so normal as to make their differences irrelevant. Hence, there arrives a pragmatism so impartial as to seem at times amoral. It has been said that the disappointed ones of 1968 compensate for the loss of their ideals of social rebirth with an unfashionable and immodest search for power. It might seem that the struggle against the authoritarianism of the fathers was only one method, like any other, to get rid of them and take their place. This is an explanation in part well based, but if it is taken as a global explanation it is too mechanical and simplistic. Yesterday's idealistic tension has lessened, but not as a result of personal betrayals. It is politics itself which has changed its form and nature. From globalizing ideology, it has moved on to the need for specific competences. Incompetent power is con demned to inertia, for one cannot control what one does not know, and one knows not in general, but in a specialist sense. For this reason, the veterans of 1968, who from being confronters have become controllers, use with a managerial coldness all the instruments they have at their disposal. The orphans of 1968 have become fathers to themselves. Close administrators of their suc cess, they calculate with precision the relationship between the desired ends and the disposable means. But how long, and how, will it be possible to remain content with reproducing the exist ing, reducing politics to administration?</page><page sequence="77">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 77 6. Man in his situation Still more radical a question must be put. How could the new authoritarianism of the "grandchildren" have replaced the old authoritarianism? Just as the churches, as monopolistic adminis trations of the sacred and the divine, make themselves exclusive repositories of the rights of salvation, even the most extreme critical intellectual positions tend to be transformed and experi enced as positions of parasitic income. He who does not belong to the Church, who does not adapt to the norm or the precept, will remain outside, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth: extra ecclesiam nulla salus. The mystery of salvation has become a balancing act. The right, the reiteration of certain procedures and specific gestures, has been frozen into meaningless behavior, no longer as a sign of the invisible, but as an empty, purely habitual gesture. Why? Because there is inherent in the sacred, at this point removed from the market and thus from the typically Eurocentric, coercive logical categories, one essential bivalency, a basic ambiguity which defines it: The sacred gives life, but also death. It is the serpent you need to awaken, but also the serpent which can poison you. This ambiguity is disquieting for the European logical, mental approach. It goes beyond dichotomous categories. In this sense it is a danger. And yet human experience cut off from the sacred does not appear as a more rationally advanced experience, but rather rationally impoverished. The sacred does not console, but rationality itself needs this impetus, which opens it, pushes it beyond itself. The point at which the positivists and in general the nineteenth century rationalists saw in the sacred only a rationalization, they did not explain the sacred. They only explained certain phenomena of its exploita tion, of its practical use on the part of certain hierocratic power structures. They did not explain, and in reality they totally under mined, the social function of Utopia, that end beyond itself which every society needs to situate itself historically and evaluate itself. This has led to a rational society like that of today which, while it itself takes account of its processes of development, no longer</page><page sequence="78">78 FRANCO FERRAROTTI knows why these take place. Think of planning in today's indus trialized societies. One sets deadlines. One fixes objectives. But were one to ask "Why?" the embarrassment would be great. Qualitative problems have been reduced to quantitative terms of productive economic potential. This is development for develop ment's sake, or development as pure expansion, a cancerous proliferation as against ordered and homogeneous growth. It seems to me that the connection with the crude utilitarianism of the eighteenth and nineteenth century type, on which this century and its policies are still based, is clear. Arriving at the threshold of the second millennium, this century realizes that on the politi co-ideological plane it has not invented anything. It has obtained extraordinary technical successes; but the truth of technique, if one may really speak of this, is a banal truth. It is the eternal return of the identical, a process which is repeated, equivalent to itself, to infinity. Only crisis and awareness of crisis can break this chain. The churches which believe themselves repositories of abso lute truth are in a state of absolute backwardness, because they place themselves outside the possibility of entering into crisis. They lose sight of man in his situation, the only reality which counts. They cannot take account of the fact that today the possi bility of crisis is the only possibility of deeper truth. The new rationality in its obscure formation, runs through a reevaluation of madness and the rediscovery of the involuntary character of thought, its emancipation as regards the functional imperatives of its technical pragmatism and political subservience; the involun tary nature of thought as extrinsic nonplanning, nonsubordination of technical rationality; nonfinalized thought, which does not think according to aims predetermined for thought itself; thought which allows itself to think, which does not impose itself but submits, which does not order but understands, which bears witness to the human presence in the world. This is thought which has renounced the Enlightenment project of guaranteeing to all a kind of compulsory happiness, eliminating the dramatic moment of existence in which what is really human is the non-completely foreseeable, the action whose result no one can securely antici</page><page sequence="79">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 79 pate. As in classical Greek tragedy, the search for truth can destroy whoever ventures on its path; yet one must go to the limit, seek one's own truth, even if this coincides with one's own death. Oedipus Rex\ 7. The sacred as bivalent reality Human reason cannot present itself as an autonomous reality, absolutely independent, "freed" from animal nature. There is in man a "reason of reason" which should be sought in the deep tracks of human beings and which reason itself, hypostasized or even enthroned in its proud, miserable loneliness, cannot under stand. There is in reason left free and isolated in its supposed autonomy a potential for violence without bounds, incapable of providing itself with controls. Perhaps it is true that the madman is he who has lost everything except reason. A capacity for rea soning, that is, reasoning for its own sake, a reasoning in pure mathematics in which and through which, from link to link, one arrives at extreme consequence, logically compelling and at the same time meaningless; a skull, bright, perhaps, but fleshless. Reason against reasonableness? In his Autobiography, Darwin is on guard against this conclu sion. There is the proposal that a second life is permitted, to make a little music, to read poetry; in a word, to remove oneself from the myth of exactness and the cogency of formal scientific reason ing, pure rationality. Socrates is correctly condemned in Athens, because his criticism undermines the bases of tradition. The "corruption" of the young, of which he is accused, has this meaning. Tradition is a factor of psychological security, and is also a technique of survival. In Plato's Laws, where the "foreign er in Athens" vainly tries to subvert through rational critique the most ancient ordinances of Crete, of "divine origin," Socrates is absent. Instead, there is wine, relaxed conversation; instead of the tight, intense dialogue on the theme of formal logic, there is conviviality, warmth, and the desire to stay together. Bergson maintains that one is provided with a natural religion, which in his</page><page sequence="80">80 FRANCO FERRAROTTI view consists in "a defensive reaction of Nature against what is found to be depressing for the individual and degrading for soci ety in the exercise of intelligence."4 Pure intelligence is seen as a danger. It destroys the stages, jumps over intermediate steps, does not recognize the long term, and does not permit harmoni ous, slow developments. These are human gifts, not without merit, certainly. Bergson remarks: Creative effort has moved successfully only on the line of evolution of which man is the head. By way of matter, knowl edge has this time, as in a model, taken the form of constructive intelligence, and invention, which bears reflection within it self, flows into liberty. However, intelligence was not without danger. Up to that moment all living creatures had drunk thirst ily of the cup of life. They relished the honey which Nature had brought to the surface, and swallowed down what was left in addition without having seen it. Intelligence, on the other hand, went deeper. In fact, the intelligent being no longer lived alone in the present. There is no reflection without prevision, prevision without disquiet, disquiet without the momentary relaxation of the attachment to life. Above all, there is no humanity without society and society requires from the individ ual a disinterest which the insect in his automatism presses to the point of oblivion of himself. It is not enough to count on reflection to maintain this interest. Intelligence would counsel egoism. It is not surprising that on the basis of these presumptions, Berg son should see in religion a basically mitigating function of intel ligence which is obscuring and dulling, maternally conservative. "State religion endears man to life, and consequently the individ ual to society, by telling him stories similar to those with which one lulls a baby."5 Religion as lullaby! But how then to explain the wars of religion, the massacres, the burnings? 8. The dialectical pole between the rational and the sacred What one does not see here is that pure intelligence in its crazy advance does not imply the whole of rationality but rather only</page><page sequence="81">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 81 formal rationality, "conceptuology," syllogizing in the void, providing reasons for itself in an essentially narcissistic game as gratuitous as it is cruel. One needs a more substantive concept of rationality. Formal rationality does not adhere with all rational ity, nor is the Weberian concept of' 'material rationality" the only type or meaning of rationality which may be counterposed to the formal type. One must turn to the critical definition of the ration al, and ask oneself about the basis which constitutes it, and from what origin its validity is derived. Weber correctly defined formal rationality, but to this he could only contrast "material rational ity," the disordered uprising of special demands. In reality it is rational discourse as human discourse; the word of dialogue, polysemic, unpredictable and thus highly problematical, which should be returned to. The rational is not thinkable, still less communicable, without what is different and is contrasted with it; that is, without the irrational. It is what has been understood, and it is the recurrent undertaking of every philosophy. However, today one must understand that rational discourse, so as not to congeal and develop into a dogmatic argument, and so not to contradict and deny itself, must open itself to what is different from itself, not only to the irrational but also to the arational and the metarational. The procedure of pure intelligence has this terrible feature: that it destroys the intermediate stages and does not stop, it has no sense of ending. Like technical progress, which can only check the internal correctness of its own operations but has nothing to say about the aims of its own movement, which is thus reduced to the eternal return to itself, so formal rationality has its hubris, its internal violence which repeats itself to infinity and denies all sense of boundary and proportion. For the classics, the shade of the ananche, whose power was even superior to that of Zeus, the father of the gods, mitigated the hyperactivism of pure intelligence. There was nothing indefinite in their life horizons. The inscrutable incomprehensibility of fate and of necessity was an insurmountable limit to their undertak ings, their knowledge and their action, and saved them from the anguish of the indefinite and the infinite. The Pillars of Hercules were not a sentence; they were a saving boundary, a sign of the</page><page sequence="82">82 FRANCO FERRAROTTI cosmos. Formal or scientific rationality, on the other hand, is infinite because it is essentially indifferent, procedural. In a post humous fragment, Nietzsche raised this question. What is there ... in science? How does it present itself? In an important sense, almost as the opponent of truth: because it is optimistic, given that it believes in logic. From a physiological point of view we note that there are periods of decadence in a strong race, those in which the type of the scientific man matures. . . . Socrates as enemy of tragedy; as dissolver of those demonic-prophylactic instincts of Art; morality, dialec tics, the moderation of the theoretical man as a form of tiredness.6 A moderation, one must add, which is apparent; that is, a mutilat ing moderation which has unburdened intelligence of all its bene ficent, vital "ballast" and thus has made it at once swifter and poorer, insipid; a complacent and solitary warbling which of necessity arrives at sollipsistic rapture. The rational is thus a relationship', it is the intersubjective argument, and hence a communication which refers back to com munity and a whole of shared and commonly experienced feel ings. This is the rational as public discourse, therefore. It is able to make the critical return on itself as laid down between subjects basically equal, but it is a discourse not closed, not able to be stabilized as the only rationally possible argument without de grading it to a dogma in the service of an elite, which in its very constitution and in the privatization of the rational, by taking for itself the discourse corresponding to it in a given historical phase, denies community. It monopolizes intersubjective communica tion, rejects understanding of the other, blocks potential develop ment, and mutilates "possible conscience," in Lukacs's sense of a higher and higher awareness. This is the rational, therefore, as a discourse open also to the irrational, to the point of understanding it positively, of under standing its real, hidden reasons, as a sign, as an inarticulate cry for help, as a symptom. Eclipse of the sacred? By no means. For</page><page sequence="83">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 83 indeed, the crisis of bureaucratic formal rationality, or of logical ly posed rationality, enlarges the space of the sacred and pro motes it as an alternative, the instrument of human survival; in a word, as the need for a whole of metautilitarian meanings, alter native as regards market logic and formal rationality, such as to permit human society not to lose its own problematic conscious ness and not deprive itself of the dynamic in which the social function of Utopia is expressed. The dialectical pole is established between the "rational" (and "irrational"), that is, the meaningfully communicable, and the "sacred," that is, the unsayable.1 Reduced to its essence, the paradox of the sacred is as follows. The "sacred" is the metahu man, which is required most of all for human coexistence, to avoid the flattening-out of living, the obscuring of the parameter or point of reference against which to measure oneself, the loss of the "sense of the problem," the risk of the loss of what is really, uniquely human in man.</page><page sequence="84">VI. The Sacred and Chaos 1. The sacred as purifying destruction: The "Islamic Revolution" The modern crisis of world political leadership has reopened, like an old wound which has never ceased to bleed, the need for secure, total guidance. In this regard, the so-called "Islamic revolution" in Iran is an instructive example.1 Assessed accord ing to the preconstituted categories of current political science, this great event has been completely misunderstood. Subtle ana lysts and well-read thinkers of extensive culture have fallen vic tim to their commonplaces in a gross manner. In the latter half of 1978, when the regime of Shah Rehza Pahlevi was evidently tottering and condemned, Western commentators offered a pitiful spectacle of incomprehension and superficiality. From the ortho dox left more or less directly linked to official Marxism, to the "lay" radical-progressive opinion from Romano Ledda to Michel Foucault, among innumerable others, the facts of Iran have been seen through the lenses and criteria of the rationalist Western European tradition. On the other hand, when the Shah, friend of the West and pillar of the defense against the bordering Soviet Union, had greater need of direct support and backing on the international political scene, President Jimmy Carter, appar ently closed in by his "doctrine of human rights," hesitated to compromise, and set himself up as defender of the weak without realizing that the weak was the formerly omnipotent heir of the Sassanids and the sumptuous, not to say prodigal, organizers of the festivals at Persepolis. On the outskirts of Paris, where he lived in exile, Ayatollah Khomeini had no doubts. He wisely 84</page><page sequence="85">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 85 capitalized on the misunderstandings and delays of the West, well aware that the moralistic scruples of the Western analysts were his best ally. Some journalists, less blinded by the diachronic sequence of ingenuous rationalism, put forward doubts regarding the necessarily progressive nature of Khomeini's return. The Shi'ite leader, it was observed, demanded the end of the monar chy, "servile to the foreigner" and "waster of the resources of the country," and the creation of an "Islamic State." It is difficult enough to grasp in its consistency the border between spirituality and fanaticism. Using contemporary polito logical categories, it is not only difficult but impossible. It is a fact that at the end of April 1978, when the first tremors of revolt ran through Iran, Khomeini, still in exile, released an interview in which he tore down all the lines of compromise with the Shah; limits on which the Iranian religious hierarchy seemed disposed to maneuver. Khomeini stated: "For us, there is no possible compromise. His crimes are innumerable and he will have to answer for them. We were against the Shah's father, we are against the present Shah, we shall be against his son and against his whole dynasty." It must have been this note of an inflexible Robespierre which convinced the European analysts that they were now on the threshold of a 1789 in the Iranian mode. Never would a prediction be more hasty. Here is no construction of a state premised on human rights, on the basis of the "immortal principles" of 1789, but rather of an "Islamic State," a return to the origins, to the time of the Prophet Mohammed and the Imam Ali. When he is questioned in a more detailed manner, not so much on industrial ization or on agrarian reform but on the use of the veil and work outside the home by women, Khomeini's responses leave no doubt as regards the "democratic" and "modern" character of his revolution, and yet, inexplicably, these are left on one side. This is the blinding power of commonplaces. Khomeini states: "In Islam the choices of woman are free, but there are immoral choices prohibited to men as well as to women, and choices are different according to whether we are dealing with men or with</page><page sequence="86">86 FRANCO FERRAROTTI women." The truth is that in Khomeini's thought, from the start, the State which ought to arise on the ruins of the Western regime of the Shah is a rigorously theocratic one in which everything is ruled by the presence of the just, avenging God of Shi'ite Mos lems. The Shi'ite holy places are in Iraq, where half the popula tion is Shi'ite, but Iran is the center of Shi'ism?93% of Iran's 33 million people are Shi'ite. We are dealing with a mass inspired by a burning faith which the Shah, in his hurry to modernize the country, was probably wrong to neglect. The days when Naraghi, formerly the Iranian delegate to unesco, wrote of the his coun try's contribution to a conception of balanced relations between the Western European technocratic world and the theocentric Moslem civilization seem long ago and unreal. Article 2 of the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran is in this regard brutally clear: The Islamic Republic is based on faith in the following princi ples: 1) the uniqueness and omnipotence of God {there is no God but Allah) and submission to his will; 2) the divine inspira tion of the laws; 3) the resurrection of the body and its edifying function in the spiritual development of man; 4) the justice of God in the creation and his realm; 5) the Imamate and its basic function in the pursuit of the Islamic revolution; 6) belief in the higher value of the individual and his freedom within the limits of responsibility toward God. 2. The resurgence of integralism The practical consequences owed to "internal enemies" are evi dent, and it is Khomeini himself who makes them explicit: These people [the jurisprudents in the service of the Sultans] must be unmasked because they are enemies of Islam. Society must reject them, because to reject and despise them is a victo ry for Islam and the Moslem cause. Our young people and our sons must pull the turbans from their heads. Where is Iranian youth? Is it dead? I am not saying we should kill them. But at</page><page sequence="87">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 87 least act so that their turbans are pulled off. . . . To us has been entrusted the cause of purifying ourselves and leading others far from the ephemeral things of this world. ... Be faithful to your religion and place no reliance on this world nor have faith in it.2 It was to be necessary to wait until 1979-80, with the issue of the American hostages and the invective of Khomeini against the United States as "the Satan of the modern world," to become fully aware that the categories of Western political science do not manage to describe, still less to explain, the phenomenon, or the the "right" and the "left" positions. If these have already lost much of their meaning in relation to Western politics, still less do they serve to clarify the political function of the sacred and the contemporary resurgence of the fanatical "integralisms" of the "true believers."3 At this point doctrinal assertions are no longer sufficient. First-hand descriptions are needed, even if impressionistic, which come from research in the field. A journalistic survey in this case can present itself as the premise for an exhaustive inves tigation. A journalist travelling through Khomeini's Iran reports: The piano is forbidden, as is wine, and it is forbidden for the man to give his support to the woman, who is worth half of him, even as a witness. It is forbidden to think of a politics which would be distant from God or Islam; it is forbidden to indulge in discussions of Western politics as of Soviet politics, which are a wickedness to be hated unto death. . . .University is forbidden save for the Faculty of Medicine, given that doctors are useful even in a revolutionary period. It is forbid den to eat the flesh of animals not butchered according to the pastoral rite; it is forbidden to eat fish of species without scales. It is forbidden to rebel against the impositions of the rough who storm through the streets, who rage in the name of revolution, because it is the very hand of God and should not be account able to anyone for judgment, not to a captain, or a minister, but only to the Imam Khomeini who always approves of them.4</page><page sequence="88">88 FRANCO FERRAROTTI From this there emerges an everyday life of grey squalor, but here too these remarks miss the target. They do not allow us to understand that what counts is beyond this, and is to be found in the realm of the totally different. Rational planning is reduced to the minimum. The existential truth of this situation is to be found in the mouth of the poets: Our people, if they imprison one, are all in revolt. And if they manacle a poet, everyone becomes a poet. Our people moves forward over a bridge of martyrs to embrace the growing dawn, the dawn of celebration.5 The capacity to plan is to all effects replaced by the "bridge of martyrs." With the Islamic revolution Iran is subject to an out break of the sacred which takes it back to its principles and in some mysterious manner puts it outside history. For history itself is, in a real, a profound sense, the profanation of the sacred. For this reason too, categories and criteria of judgment used for historical facts are inadequate when we are dealing with the sacred, which is in essence the end, the fulfillment, the check mate of history. 3. The mass suicide of the "People's Temple" In the same space of time, while the Islamic revolution gradually revealed its "sacred" characteristics and presented itself as the culminating moment of a supreme purifying destruction, in the evolved United States (the never sufficiently denounced "Satan" of the modern world) there unfolded an analogous and essentially homogeneous phenomenon: the exit from history, through collec tive suicide, of a whole human group, gathered together in the</page><page sequence="89">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 89 sect of the Reverend Jim Jones, called the "People's Temple.'' In this case, all the descriptive and explicative Schemas of contem porary social science exploded at first blow. The event had an immediate, abnormal specificity. The 912 suicides by North American citizens at Jonestown in Guyana, on 18 November 1978, fell on an incredulous and dismayed public opinion.6 It should not be surprising that mechanisms of reassurance were released at once: nothing happened, and if by chance something had happened it happened far off, abroad, as at other times with primitive tribes not too well identified. But the seat of the sect, or the "cult" as it is perhaps more exact to say, was in the most civilized city?San Francisco, California?in those United States which are the advanced point of technical progress and rationally organized industrial societies. One has to go and see for oneself. Secondary sources are not enough. They give data and problems which simple intelligence, a splendid shortcut, is not able to foresee: the color of the earth, the landscape, the quality of relations between man and man and man and nature, the type of texture of co-existence, the "music" of society, that is to say the quality and style of the noises which announce human presence (the screech of the trams on a bend in Turin at night; the constant buzz of Manhattan; the animated silence, whispering, with lights out, of certain squares in Bom bay . . .). Pure intelligence leads to the loss of the senses. Guten berg man will enjoy an extraordinary visual sharpness, but his senses of smell, touch, and hearing risk obsolescence if not atro phy through lack of use.7 Direct participation, on the spot, is thus indispensable. So be careful of the delusions of the first meeting. San Francisco is an enchanted mirage. Its climate is fairly uni form through the whole year. From December to March it is the climate of a timid spring: already hot during the day, but with unexpected night-time repentances. There are mysterious and fascinating mists in the early morning, and sunsets which, seen from the Golden Gate Bridge or the Cliff House, are of an unreal beauty which in a reflective individual makes doubt rise: What have I done to merit all this? There are, however, small perceptions which crowd upon the</page><page sequence="90">90 FRANCO FERRAROTTI visitor on his arrival and which should not be left aside under a blanket of habit, perhaps by way of the overload. The steel cable buried under the roadway in the third track which helps the traffic of the small picturesque trams?the famous cable cars?puts out day and night the sound of a pulley which is more like a human cry than a metallic shriek. The idyllic, postcard atmosphere is only a facade. The scenic boulevard which leads, by way of the Presidio, to the rocks of Cliff House is a theatrical set. One needs to scratch only a little below the surface. The true face of the city will not be long in revealing itself. The atmosphere of quiet contentment in reality covers the drama of many, too many, people lost: braceros from Mexico, orientals from the Pacific, blacks from all the interior states more traditionalist and often closed into castes, New Yorkers with defeats, divorces, and var ious upsets on their backs, all come here to begin again, hopefully with a clean slate. California, here I come. . . . San Francisco is the point of the greatest' 'experimentation'' in the United States. However, we are not dealing with an experi mentation of an intellectual kind, something of the Left Bank, something halfway between the student maudit and Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf. Here we are not dealing with the conceptual level, or one does not play only on that level. The dice are not loaded. One plays with one's own skin in corpore vivo. Homosex ual couples more uxorio go down O'Farrell Street holding each other by the hand in the impinging dark of the mild evening. They cuddle. The lower blocks of Powell Street permanently swarm with a nocturnal fauna which drag on from one park bench to another, sleeping, eating, vomiting, copulating, according to a pattern of spontaneous and immediate life to which only Henry Miller might have done justice and which today would still be the delight of a Goya or a Daumier. Of every ten inhabitants of San Mateo county, eight are divorced, nine have religions different from one another, and one is an atheist. The average period of residence is no more than ten years. There is no surprise that human coalescence is difficult, putting down roots, aggregation. People are looking for a sign, an absolute leader, the certainty of</page><page sequence="91">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 91 belonging. In reality, everything seems ephemeral, diffuse, pro visional. Anything but a melting pot! Differences tend to be more marked, to close themselves in a desperate attempt for identity. Paradoxically this plasticity is the premise for an opening-up which grants California today basically a role of hopefulness, the faith that everyone will make it. Fed by the mass media and the whole mythology of individual success in a competitive society, this hope, however, is generally betrayed, especially among the blacks. The human groups which have behind them solid cultural traditions, sturdy family connections, concrete terms of socio psychological identity like language, cuisine, and so forth, save themselves. While I reflect on the mass suicide of the members of the People's Temple sect, it seems to me that none of the preced ing obtains for the blacks of San Francisco. Like all American blacks, they undergo an almost perfect genocide. They have been historically separated from their indigenous culture and have not been accepted into American culture. They are halted, blocked in a no-man's land. It is no surprise that the majority of the followers of Jim Jones were black. It has been said by some that they found in him the old white master, the slave-master of the Deep South, but to me this doesn't seem necessary. Indeed, California is for them a promise?a promise ultimately not kept. Here there is a most interesting paradox. In closed social situations?rigidly structured according to traditional stratifica tions, in which one becomes nothing other than what one was born to be, in which vertical mobility is practically nil and possi bilities of social promotion do not exist?the individual never has a way of demonstrating his value as an individual. He is never challenged, he has to prove nothing to anybody, not even to himself. However, where the situation appears fluid?where op portunities abound, or at least where they are said to abound, and where social stratification is not rigid, or where it is said that individual competence indeed moves one along? the inability to rise up the social ladder necessarily takes the forms and the character of a personal failure without recourse. In California it is precisely the absence of limitations and traditional closures which</page><page sequence="92">92 FRANCO FERRAROTTI makes personal failure harder. Better, infinitely better and more natural, is the almost gentle failure of the black in Alabama. These sociological considerations are essential to commence the understanding of the most spectacular mass suicide of this cen tury. That citizens of the most technically advanced country on the planet arrived at this should make one think. The ghetto in San Francisco might reasonably appear the pure and simple center for a gathering together of inferior individuals, who cannot look for excuses in the social exclusions of a feudal type, which do not exist here, or of those who "haven't made it," who have stayed behind solely through their own fault, and who have thus lost contact with the rest of society. 4. How one gets out of the black ghetto Here, however, a problem of general importance is raised. Let us pose this problem through a question: How does one leave the black ghetto in the United States? The paths are few. The first is afforded by the school, as an instrument and occasion for mobil ity, the acquisition of a specific professional status, an entry into the labor market with a competence which gives right to an equal remunerative and normative recognition, and at the same time social respectability. However, one knows how black schools are: integration marks time. On the other hand, universities "that count," which through their diplomas open the doors of presti gious, well-paid careers, are difficult and costly. The second path is that of enrichment through prostitution and drug-peddling, but we are already in the tortuous realm of the underworld and trans gression of the norm. The third is political life, but the move ments of the blacks are now waning; the leaders who have not acquiesced in cooptation by the existing power system have been killed. Since the assassination of Martin Luther King, the black movement has been leaderless. There remains a fourth way. The fourth way is that generically described as the religious one. Here, exploration is difficult. There is not only a question of</page><page sequence="93">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 93 finding in religious forms a certain psychic repair, a kind of compensation in sacred terms for the defeats endured in daily practice, nor does the problem consist only in the restoration in terms of religious exaltation of collective values which the domi nant society tramples and destroys through techniques of expul sion and emargination. There is a positive aspect of the religious path which should be stressed. This lies in the religious, sacred choice as the reason for living, an attempted reconstruction of the dead community, or the community which was never possessed, historically annulled. In this perspective, the case of the collec tive suicide of the members of the "People's Temple," however extreme, is not anomalous, and indeed it is confirmed in a tried and consolidated model. That the massacre should take place in Guyana but at the hands of American citizens should not be astonishing. The psychiatric and psychological terms are possibly inevitable, but they should not mislead the analysis. In fact it is true, as has been noted, that the ghastly collective suicide-homicide was prepared and in the end imposed by the leader of a parareligious sect at the height of his paranoic introversion. In the name of a collective purification of the contagion experienced from demoniacal forces of people from outside, sent officially to check the condition of the sect, Jim Jones, 47 years old, charismatic leader of the movement, unleashed a plan, prepared for some time, to confront the expect ed battles with the forces of evil. However, one should not fall into the trap of unilaterally psychologistic explanation, for it ends up by pigeonholing this event into the categories of an exception al, scandalously unique case, when in fact it belongs rightfully to the normality of those religious and parareligious groups which should be analytically distinguished into "cults," "sects," and "denominations." It seems to me that the "People's Temple" specifically enters into the category of cults. Jonestown?it has been perspicaciously noted?is the city founded in the name of the charismatic leader, a new Jerusalem or Promised Land in the mind of the leader and his adoring followers.</page><page sequence="94">94 FRANCO FERRAROTTI Not by chance, far from the evil world of the establishment. Isolated in the forest in a foreign country, a center created from nothing by the faithful of Jones, emigrated and transplanted by force from their ultimate Californian seat, San Francisco, when the difficulties, suspicions, the gossip, had already begun there to cast shadows on the organization of the "People's Temple." This flight of the community toward the Promised Land repeats a paradigmatically archaic model, unconsciously instilled by the leader: the flight of the Jews from Egypt toward Zion, or in more modern times the flight of the "Latter Day Saints" toward the New Jerusalem (Utah) pointed out by the vision of their prophet, Joseph Smith. For Jones, too, there was a prophetic vision. He had seen in a "spiritual revelation" the nuclear catastrophe of the whole world, the explosion of huge racial conflicts. For him, the end of the world was imminent. For this reason he had gathered around him, first at Indianapo lis in Indiana, his native area, then in California, in Redwood City, and thence San Francisco, a group of followers who adhered to his prophesies and waited for the salvation he prom ised the believers. This phenomenon which in an anthropologi cal perspective is not surprising if one thinks of the swarming? quite recent in this age of fragmentation and sociocultural crisis of the Western world?of millennarian, messianic, and Salvationist sects.9 The collective suicide in Guyana is therefore not exceptional in itself. Without going into all the laborious preliminary analytical distinctions between cults, sects, and denominations, which is nonetheless necessary, one may state that these sacral groups share common aspects on which one should reflect. First, they take the nucleus of their proselytes from among the emarginated, or at least the underprivileged strata of the population (blacks, hippies, dropouts, drug addicts). In the case of Jones's group we see 15-20% whites, of the middle and upper-middle strata, who feel guilty because of their privileges in American society as whites, and have given over to the group all their possessions in expiation.10 The second characteristic of these groups is that all recognize</page><page sequence="95">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 95 an absolute charismatic leader, whose decisions are not dis cussed, and to whom one indeed owes blind obedience however "unnatural" the orders may appear. In the case of the People's Temple, this acquiescence, this corpse-like obedience, leads to collective suicide, showing itself to be much stronger than the instinct of self-preservation. In other cases, it leads to prostitu tion for the benefit of the group, as in the case of the ' 'Children of God," or to absolute chastity, as in the groups of Vedan inspira tion, or to begging or even to marriage imposed on and accepted by partners who do not know each other, as in the case of the Reverend Moon, who marries off young people at a rate of five or six thousand couples a year. A third common aspect concerns the charismatic leader who, if he is not himself the direct link with divinity, is ' 'God on earth,'' so that only to someone who forgets this detail can Jones's words pronounced to his disciples at the hour of the suicide ("Today we shall all be in Paradise") sound grotesquely sinister, however they recall those of Christ on the cross. A fourth common characteristic is given by the usefulness of a certain level of persecution, which, as long as it does not go beyond certain limits seems wholly functional to the cohesion of the group. The "sense of the enemy" reinforces cohesion. This, to be sure, is a cohesion which is assured also by specific tech niques all tending to the weakening of individual will, inducing one to live only for the community, and in practice for the leader who represents and incarnates it. The individual disciple must learn to deny himself as an individual and to live as a function of another. For this reason too, he is made to renounce his family and all his preexisting links of friendship. He is led to perceive the entire world outside the community as a radically extraneous, if not a hostile one. Hence not only vegetarian diet, perhaps, but also exhausting work and the renunciation of any financial means to which one has free access. The community takes care of the individual disciple and at the same time "takes him into care," isolating him from the family and from the external world. Hence the fifth characteristic of the groups arises: a seeming</page><page sequence="96">96 FRANCO FERRAROTTI preference for children and for young adults still in the adolescent state, especially the very sensitive and artistic, endowed with a half-culture and a need of information and psychological experi ence superior to the average; all in all weak strata, easily impres sionable and moldable. Only Transcendental Meditation seems to open itself to whole family groups and not to single youths, who are otherwise the privileged human material from the point of view of proselytism. It is no surprise that the organizational structure of the groups shows a common tendency toward hierar chical structure maintained by an obedience unto death of the followers as regards the charismatic leader, who exercises an absolute power. Finally, all the groups are waiting for an extraordinary event: the cosmic catastrophe in which only the members of the chosen group will be saved. We find statements and attitudes of an analogous kind also with certain Catholic charismatics such as Padre Pio da Pietrelcina and Enzo Alocci.11 5. The "third term" or community rediscovered By reason of this series of arguments, one must apply a multi disciplinary perspective. However, it is also necessary, from a speculative point of view in the real sense, to understand what the tragic deviations noted above might tend to obscure: that the sacred endures as a need for meta-individual meaning which gives direction and orientation to the individual himself. The "third term"?i.e., the totality of experiences and shared values "produced" at once by every human group?allows interchange and synthesis with the interests and impulses of individuals. The risk of a more or less sophisticated psychologization of the terms of the problem is a real one, which the most aware commentators have not entirely escaped.12 On this level the problem poses itself as insoluble and it can be simply, if somewhat crudely, dismissed by referring to psychiatric categories. These are legitimate, cer tainly, with reference to specific subjects or individual idiosyn</page><page sequence="97">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 97 crasies, but are by themselves incapable of providing the inter pretation and understanding, if not the explanation, of phenom ena endowed with social importance. Thus, there is no surprise that research should restrict the problem area to quite narrow dimensions which, if they have the positive element of making the problem more manageable, however meet the undeniable disadvantage of impoverishing it to the point of making it rela tively insignificant. This reductive process usually takes two paths, opposed and symmetrical. The first absorbs it into the logic of the great mass media, flattening its contours to the point of transforming it into a theme of polite conversation with the opportunity for a supple mentary frisson for a bored public or as a strange novelty for seekers after esoteric experiences. The other path loses sight of the nature of the sacred as collective value by sinking it into a dark, unattainable abyss of individual introspection and by reduc ing it to the mysterious delights of mystical fervor. There is no doubt that the role of the mass media in the tragedy of Jonestown still awaits its full assessment.13 It seems clear that Congressman Leo Ryan, killed at Jonestown as he was boarding a plane to return to the United States, often pursued news stories and scoops which provided him with a way of shining on the front page. We know the imperatives of total exteriorization and radi cal open-mindedness which this involves: to live as a performer, life as a permanent rehearsal, as theater. The mass media and their employees have their unforgettable priorities. They do not "report"?that is, they do not reflect? reality, they construct it. Not only this. The mass media do not "mediate"?that is to say, they do not give the proper weight to?the facts. They do not inform the public but rather are parasitic on them; and thus they deform, reduce or amplify, cut and reformulate, so that a specta cle is produced. The followers of the "People's Temple" saw the mass media as systematic violators of their truth, the instrument of a systematic persecution of their leaders and thus of them selves. The deep hostility they demonstrated in this regard is that which one reserves for mortal enemies. The same mass media</page><page sequence="98">98 FRANCO FERRAROTTI who underlined the isolation of the blacks in the "People's Tem ple" in Guyana are silent about their isolation and their segrega tion in California. When on a visit to the San Francisco base of the group I mentioned the fact that the residents of Jonestown were there under duress, that they were transplanted under a coercion more or less violent, people responded to me with a wave of the hand which pointed to what was happening close by, on Steiner Street or Fillmore Avenue. In the huge courtyard beside the Temple there lay in more or less disorderly fashion old cars, wooden crates with the label "Guyana Agricultural Project," caravans, and at least five "buses in good condition." These must have been what Jim Jones used for taking his disciples from one place to another on the occasion of outdoor demonstrations to reward or punish friendly or hostile politicians. It looked like a camping ground in disarray. Meanwhile, at the corner of Geary and Steiner streets, the machines were working away, razing old houses which had be come the habitations of poor people, so as to level the soil. It was clear that a massive urban renewal was being got under way. In the place of those crumbling old houses there would soon be new, comfortable condominiums, with a single "inconvenience'': they would be too expensive for the old black inhabitants of this quar ter. Thus urban renewal would be transformed into a massive urban removal, a removal from the urban center of the present inhabitants, for the most part blacks with irregular and low in comes. This meant that a phase of still more marked emargina tion, not only socio-political and cultural but also topographical, practical, and concrete, would begin, as happened to the inhabi tants of the historic center in Rome at the time of the Fascist clearances, as happened everywhere in the world and as happens still today, irrespective of what political power is supreme, in Valle Aurelia, whenever a technocratic decision or the maximiza tion of profit makes its simplistic logic felt by opening up the path to the bulldozers. Not everything is abstract in the need for meaning and the</page><page sequence="99">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 99 sacred. On the contrary. What seems farthest from the everyday and its immediate needs is in reality essential to it and is its deep root. The idea of the agrarian community in Guyana is not only that of the New Jerusalem, the failed realization of a messianic dream or a total regeneration. It is also the response to very precise and weighty questions, although these are extraneous and not readily visible, thanks to middle bourgeois respectability. It is the response to social emargination, to the not knowing where to go once one has been uprooted from one's own area and once one's own community has been destroyed. It is from this point of view that the self-interested "dismissals" of so many comments demonstrate their interest. It is too easy to discourse wisely on the "death wish" or primitivism or "pseudo cohesion," or generi cally, on unsuspected madness. It can also be a matter of the exasperated emargination of numerically large groups, who are unable or made unable to express their political protest in an efficient manner through traditional channels, deprived of a real capacity to take reprisals, and involved in the smooth cruel mechanism of a technically advanced society in which there is no time to be given to someone who has fallen out. 6. The sign of divinity as power In this perspective appear also the deficiencies of a reduction of the sacred to the mystical?this process which would like to be purifying and humanizing, while it simply arrives at the quiet desperation of sollipsism.14 More seriously still: it functions as an anaesthetic and an alibi for the social responsibilities of groups in a position of relative advantage, for the heights of society which have no more interest in development and change in a structural sense, because from these they would only fear an alteration of existing equilibria and thus a threat to their privi lege. Emargination is therefore exalted as a source of desire and an ally of creativity. There is a confusion of marginality chosen as an ideal for living by a prophetic minority, with the factual</page><page sequence="100">100 FRANCO FERRAR0TT1 condition imposed by circumstances, by the social relationships which are still power relationships over inert masses reduced to silence and incapable of reprisal, their tongues slit and useless fuel for the history made by others. Here it is then that "sacred ness discovers in Nature the sign of divinity as power," and that "religion arises as the gesture of conciliation between the power of the world and the reality of man, the constant passage of the chaos into cosmos, the victory over the threat of obscure reality through the gesture of recognition of assimilation."15 This is a peculiar homeopathic cure which ignores the nature of religion as hierocratic structure, bureaucratized and often sclerotic, the arm of a sacred contradictorily conceived and administered as an exclusive monopoly to the point of crime,16 negation of the col lective character of the sacred and its profound genesis from below, the sacrilegious legitimation of the merchants in the Tem ple which deliberately ignores the fact that the sacred is such precisely in that it removes itself and surpasses the laws of the market, challenges the logic of former institutions and exalts the social function of Utopia. It has not been understood that the genesis, the "production" of the sacred is not to be sought in pure desire and thus in the idol and fetishism of the image. The genesis of the sacred lies in the need for community. In a sense the sacred comes before the idea of God: it constructs it in His image and appearance?as a protective force, a paternal power. It is the guarantee of the rediscovered community, beyond any formerly codified credo as the minimal basis of possible humanity. Strictly connected to the historical essence of God, the parable of the Good Samaritan is presented here as a basic text. Its suggestive ness is directly proportional to its basic character and its charac ter, at the same time revolutionary, in the real sense, not merely rhetorical according to the fashion which has become popular in the modern press. In it, in fact, there is once again confirmed the idea of the "approximate" as universal value. It is the whole "village morality," with its special idiocy which tends to see in the outsider the enemy or the "barbarian," which is here chal lenged and clearly defeated. In this sense, the parable contains a</page><page sequence="101">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 101 message which is profoundly innovative and has moral, social, and political-revolutionary consequences. The "villager" is transformed?more precisely is forced to transform himself? into a "dweller in the world." There are no longer "people nearest to you" because they are kin, blood relations, friends, neighbors, or co-religionists, and still less because they are phys ically neighbors or close. There are people close to you because they belong to the "human race" on the basis of an essential equality which, while it defeats any ethnocentric closure, refers us back to a common undivided heritage: all men are men. After this parable there is no priority, true or invented; there is no right of primogeniture; there is no racial discrimination or colonial domination (whether for good or, as one said some time ago, "civilizing") which could stand, even only as a temporary or emergency measure. The priest and the Levite who go onward and do not stop, passing by the wounded man, represent a bureaucratized facade religion, reduced to the mechanical form of an external rite, now without an authentic internal participation and thus condemned to decline into repetition of empty and hypocritical gestures of offi cialdom. Now it is the turn of the stranger, even the traditional enemy of the Jews, the Samaritan, who here represents the purely human man, with his natural virtues (the "man without myths" of Felice Balbo), to come forward and take up and look after the wounded man. But who is the wounded man? He is not only the unfortunate individual who by accident has run up against thieves. It is enough to live to run up against them. The Imitation of Christ explicitly confirms: "Every time I went amongst men I returned riddled with wounds." However, the wounded remain on Earth, suffering in the dust or on the asphalt, when society has lost the sense of a common, meta-utilitarian connection so as to reduce itself to the precarious balance of mutual blackmail, the external contact of pure physical nearness, which defines today's solitary crowds. Why does one go beyond this? As a way of distraction: by lack of understanding, not necessarily for a planned, conscious</page><page sequence="102">102 FRANCO FERRAR0TT1 nastiness; because "time is short"; because "the green light is on and we want to hurry so as not to block the traffic." The paradox of this epoch is basically banal. Everyone hurries be cause they are afraid of the blockage of the traffic, but no one arrives because like Marcus Aurelius's traveler, they have forgot ten the aim of the journey. The instruments have been perverted and transformed into ends. We revolve, anxious and lost, within a style of life technically refined and humanly absurd. We live in an era in which, contradictorily, there are present a maximum of interpersonal communications, indeed interplan etary ones, and also the daily despair of insurmountable loneli ness. Communications, instead of illuminating, are parasitic; they distort instead of informing and giving direction. The spaces of time necessary for personal meditation and for the critical acquisition of knowledge are destroyed. The rhythms of life are beaten out by impersonal technological imperatives which have the frustrating coerciveness of a perfection without an end. Possi bly, everyday violence itself is the most obvious symptom of this existential absurdity. It is a vital force which has gone off the rails, a badly calculated embrace, an often fatal short-cut which claims to be able to cut short the langeurs of logical discourse with the dryness of a proverbial, resolving gesture. Behind the apparent gratuitousness of many modern crimes there is hidden this anxiety for visibility, the need to get away from anonymity, the crisis of witnessing. One understands, but does not justify, the frustration of the rulers. The problem is too deep to hope that one can resolve it by decree. It involves value-orientations on which people, whether they know it or not, stake their own life and the meaning of their own death.</page><page sequence="103">Notes i. 1. See G.

"Only if we gather together all the phenomena which are usually assigned to the area of the sacred (and also many which do not seem to belong there) into a closely related and significant whole of 'power,' and further attempt to understand what power is from this point of view, can we finally identify how vast is the context of sacredness, infiltrating into all aspects of life in society, the connecting thread of all features of a culture, heavily coercive for all individuals. Why has this fact . . . escaped us till now? ... I think the answer is to be found in two main factors: 1) never having looked at culture really as a global model . . .; 2) always having assumed?even scholars who felt themselves and announced themselves to be 'lay'?that the Christian religion was of a nature quite differ ent from any other religion. This assumption originated in the fact?anyway quite evident?that Christianity, however lay the scholars were, still continued to belong to their cultural world and thus, as European, had necessarily to be different, superior to all the other cultural worlds," pp. 22-3 (emphasis in original). 5. It is easy from this point of view to understand the anxiety?more pastoral and organizational than cognitive in the scientific sense?which marks the thesis of the "eclipse of the sacred," as well as its typical concern and preoccupation with religious observance and its basic empirical indices, such as attendance at the sacraments, the number of vocations, religious as opposed to civil marriages, and so on.

The two examples given here?the "Islamic revolution" of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran and the mass suicide in Guyana by the members of the "People's Temple"?are not to be conceived as belonging to same sphere of historical experience and relevance. In particular, as far as the "Islamic revolu tion" is concerned, it is evident that Islam is taken here in its popular and "external" form, or dogmatic aspect, which by itself does not touch on nor fully respect the meaning of the great tradition of Islamic mysticism. This tradition is, in fact, a striking example of a universalistic, nondogmatic atti tude, open to all the transcendent elements and values which are present in the historically determined religions. The careful and humble retrieval, identifica</page><page sequence="107">THE PARADOX OF THE SACRED 107 tion, and assembling of such elements, essentially imbued with a strong ecu menical awareness, is perhaps the crucial condition for the theoretical elabora tion and the lived experience of a "perennial religion" under present day circumstances. The third volume of this project, of which The Paradox of the Sacred is the middle volume and A Theology for Atheists the first, will address this problem specifically. 2.

See McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy for the widespread consequences of spatial logic, spatially fragmented, linked to the press and to cultural consump sumption based on visual activity. Even earlier, at the start of the century, see Simmel's research on the psychic conditions of metropolitan life, its "cortical izing" effects, and ultimately the internal drying-out these seem to involve. 8. According to evidence I collected directly in San Francisco some weeks after the drama, the coercive nature of the migration seemed doubtful. 9. See V.

One can understand the anxiety and worries of the families of these members, remembering also the financial aspects of the question and the documented fact that new members are generally persuaded to transfer their funds to the community. The literature on this is not as full as one might expect. However, see M. Del Re, Culti emergenti e dirittopenale, Jovene, Camerino, 1982, also R. Ikor, Jeporteplainte, Puf, Paris, 1981, in which a father reports the case of his son's subjection, ending up in the clutches of a cult and then committing suicide. 11. See Forme del sacro, cit.. 12. For an instructive example, see E. Pozzi, "Secularisation et deboires due sacre: le suicide collectif de Jonestown," in Cahiers internationaux de sociologie, lxxii, 1982, pp. 131-43. Pozzi's criticisms of D?rkheim pertain exclusively to the tripartite typology of suicide as set out in Le suicide (altruis tic, egoistic, anomic). Perhaps a certain amount of attention to the general concept of "lay morality" in D?rkheim would have been profitable, as found too in lesser writings such as those collected in L'education morale, PUF, Paris, 1963, esp. pp. 41 ff.</page><page sequence="108">108 FRANCO FERRAROTTI 13.

Chernenko, in his role as ideological controller, has been promoting " socialist realism " in the Soviet arts and literature; it would seem that it is " socialist funerealism " that prevails in Soviet life. However " interim " a leader Chernenko may turn out to be, neither the problems of the " real " succession, nor the problems of the Soviet economy can be swept under the carpet. In this issue of SURVEY we scrutinize Andropov's 15 months in power and analyse what Chernenko's succession may signal. We also have an extended analysis of the problem of Soviet economic reform which includes a sensational Soviet document - the leaked Novosibirsk Report.

LEINFELLNER Editors: G. L. EBERLEIN, W. KROEBER-RIEL Managing Editor: H. BERGHEL Theory and Decision concentrates on three major points of interest common to the social sciences: 1. Application of the advanced methodology of philosophy of science, logic, and mathematics. 2. Discussion of empirical models in terms of formal structures. 3. Intensification of interdisciplinary communication. The journal is dedicated to the analysis and application of these methods. The aim is not to philosophize without intrinsic obliga tion, but to analyze concrete presuppositions, axiomatizations, and structures, and to criticize the methods and results of the aforementioned subjects for the purpose of increasing their efficiency and integration.
