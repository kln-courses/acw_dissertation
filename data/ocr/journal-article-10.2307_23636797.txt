<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIOLOGY OF DE VI ANC Y AND CONCEPTIONS OF MORAL ORDER Paul Rock {London)* Major perspectives on social organisation must often be distorted and simplified in order to make them serviceable. In university settings, for instance, the structure of teaching imposes a truncated and stereotyped form on many complex arguments. In this paper, I shall discuss the more interesting transformation which necessarily accompanies the close analysis of sociological problems. When a particular area receives detailed study, other issues are inevitably thrown out of focus. But it is never possible to dismiss all the peripheral issues. Some must be accounted for, although the accounts may be most cursory. Around any focus of explicit interest there are always penumbral areas which must be sketched in before the main work of analysis can be carried out. When focused research is cumulative and becomes the basis of a specialist tradition, the intellectual significance of these peripheral areas also becomes a stabilised part of the tradition. Their treatment receives much the same standardised form as the more detailed arguments which lie at the tradition's core. The specialist sociologists generally share a common knowledge about these areas rather than a common knowledge of them. That knowledge is the creature of a commonsense reasoning which is rarely thought to merit independent and critical examination. After all, it is subordinate to the tradition's primary concerns. It may eventually become so authoritative that it will simply trivialise the unexaminable features of the larger world. It is thus very often the case that particular branches of sociology vulgarise models of behaviour which receive more sophisticated expression elsewhere. They take for granted what others define as perplexing. Not only does this apply to areas of specialist interest, it also holds for levels of sociological abstrac tion. Macro-sociology must take as unproblematic the constitutive features of the small worlds which collectively make up social structure. It must take on trust the stability of the interpretative arrangements which men employ to make sense of their lives. Similarly, the micro-sociologist must acknow ledge the parts played by central institutions which he is unable or unwilling to examine. Such commonsense presuppositions about contexts tend to be fashioned after the manner of the central analytic style. Modes of thought which dominate the main tradition are echoed in the treatment of outlying areas. What is known about these areas must be reasonably consistent with what is known of the centre. Forms found in both regions must mesh with one another and share congruent patterns of development. Not only are the * D.Phil., Department of Sociology, The London School of Economics.

When the thought which is devoted to marginal issues is unreflecting, it is inevitably parasitic on the parental tradition. Moreover, the tradition's specific system of emphases will selectively highlight features of the penumbra which are relevant to it. Much of the penumbra will be simply ignored as having no bearing on the problems at hand. Around every specialist area there are subordinate zones which take on its colouring. Thus, deviancy will not be the same phenomenon to the sociologies of religion, politics and develop ment. If it does receive mention, it will be described by the peculiar vocabu laries of those sociologies. A sociologist doing focused work therefore suspends his sense of curiosity about the matters that obliquely concern him. It is this process of triviali sation which frequently leads to bad theory. Neglected issues need constant surveillance because they can damagingly insulate a tradition from other stances. What is one sociology's margin is another's core. The perspective obtained on a school by outsiders is usually affected by the school's manage ment of the outsider's interests and, when those interests are ineptly handled, the strategic concerns at the core may be disregarded. As a result, misleading conceptions may arise to inhibit the interplay of ideas. Since any specialist sociology is a set of perspectives which systematically preclude the asking of certain questions, the discouragement of outsiders who might put those questions will thwart development. Surveillance is also necessary because the influence exerted by the peripheral zones is generally potent. The formulation of ideas about central problems depends on what is taken for granted about the rest of the world. When what is taken for granted is ill-founded or inconsistent, the tradition's projects can themselves falter. An important example of such a relationship between centre and periphery can be discovered in the conceptions of political and moral organisation that are held by many sociologists of deviancy. Although I shall dwell on only a few of these conceptions, it should become clear that the deviancy tradition has failed to confront some critical problems in its interpretation of moral order. That interpretation is becoming ever more salient as the perspective pursues its exploration of the rule-making and rule-enforcing work which regulates deviant worlds. Such work is taken to mirror and sustain master features of a moral scheme which is largely based on intentional and unintentional duplicity. It is as yet poorly under stood by exponents of the tradition. The materials for its analysis have been extracted from the tradition's main repository of ideas and intellectual strategies. They have not been derived from the sociologies of politics or morals, disciplines which bear directly on the problems that are raised. Evolved to deal with very different issues, these materials are simply incap able of managing the peculiar problems that reside in this once marginal area. Such problems are of a distinct analytic order which demands special treatment. In my discussion of the failure to provide that treatment, I hope that I shall illustrate how knowledge can become deformed in an important area of sociology. 140</page><page sequence="3">THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVIANCY AND CONCEPTIONS OF MORAL ORDER By the "deviancy tradition," I mean that body of ideas which has become especially associated with the work of Lemert, Becker, Douglas and others. It is identified by its proponents and opponents alike as a dis tinctive perspective on social problems. It is chiefly distinguished by a phenomenalism and an emphasis on Verstehen which propel analysis towards the study of small, bounded social settings. Both features engender an ingrained distrust of approaches which are thought to reify, systematise or abstract. It is held that violence is done to the phenomenal world when explanatory ideas become too detached from concrete observable settings. Work is controlled by a methodological injunction to reproduce faithfully scenes as they are experienced by their participants. Analysis is typically constitutive, involving the systematic dissection of unfolding meanings and action. When generalisation is undertaken, it tends to take the guise of modest formalist statements about the underlying structures of behavioural and interpretative processes. A great stress is placed upon the analytic significance of changing identity for the understanding of developing inter action. The responses of self and others (particularly agents of social control) are the major descriptive materials upon which explanation is built. The focal concern of the deviancy tradition is therefore the changing contexts in which deviant selves are assumed or discarded. Thus, the moral careers of the drug-taker, the mental patient and the prostitute receive detailed ethnographic attention. These core features have impressed their imprint on the treatment of peripheral areas. In particular, phenomenalism has produced a radical version of pluralism which defines society as an agglomerate of small worlds which lacks overall structure. Close attention to the character of these worlds has brought about a heightened awareness of their great complexity and intricacy. When their finer contours are in focus, they readily appear as systems which can never be wholly reproduced elsewhere. They are regulated by their own laws which can never be generalised. Every social world is unique at this level of microscopic analysis. In particular, every world is distinguished by its unique structures of" values " and " meanings." Sociologists of deviancy are consequently most critical of theories of consensus. These theories are taken to portray society as a precisely defined moral order which is marred by little dissent. Deviants are held to be represented as the few who are estranged from a universe of overt agreement about a society's major concerns. By contrast, deviancy sociologists typically main tain that no good intellectual purpose is served by considering so opaque and abstract an entity as "society." Lemert (1967, p. 8), for instance, remarks " when attention is drawn to a contemporary, urban, secular, technologically based society such as [the American], the notion such a society has a common value hierarchy, either culturally transmitted or structurally induced, strains credulity." Phenomenalism has further elaborated pluralism through the emphasis placed by some thinkers on the vagueness, ambiguity and fluidity of everyday life. Description which aims to capture commonsense interpretations must reflect their confusion and uncertainty. Notions of structure are hard to 141</page><page sequence="4">PAUL ROCK apply to observable settings. They are impossible to apply to the world beyond such settings. Thus Znaniecki, who was one of the perspective's forefathers, dismissed the very idea of social structure as misleading. In Heracleitian fashion, he refused to impute solidarity and form to flux. Similarly, Douglas (1970, p. 20) argues: " Life is too immensely complex, too uncertain, too conflictful, and too changing for any set of abstract and predetermined rules to specify activities that will have results seen as adequate by the individual actors." Any effort to represent society as regulated by a shared moral system is typically identified as " absolutist." The myth of " absolutism " is upheld by professional apologists who falsely claim that morals are categorical and independent of human volition. The only valid context for moral judgment is the individual world in which an act occurs. Any other altern ative smacks of ethical imperialism. Thus Young (1971, p. 50) maintains: " Relativists would deny the possibility of speaking ex cathedra on behalf of society .... What is deviant or normal. . . cannot be judged in an absolute fashion : one cannot say in a definitive manner that to act in a certain way is absolutely deviant or normal; one can only judge the normality or deviancy of a particular item of behaviour relatively against the standards of the particular group you choose as your moral yardstick. To act in a certain way then can be simultaneously deviant and normal depending on whose standards you are applying." Relativism and pluralism also stem from the perspective's advocacy of practising systematic distrust. It is argued that the social world can become accessible to study only when its features are treated as thoroughly problematic. The sociologist of deviancy must distance himself from the assumptions that are entertained by the world's inhabitants and by authori tative outsiders. Husserl called this distanced state the phenomenological epoché. It promotes a reluctance to accept any social arrangements as part of a natural order. All is tentative and, in one sense, arbitrary. Consensus on any major scale either conceals pluralistic ignorance or else it is the result of deliberate mystification. Thus Douglas (1970, p. 21) states: " Official organizations have objectified the absolute morality for the whole society: they have become a largely independent force external to the great majority of individuals in society and exercising powers over them in matters of morality, normalcy, and social order." Young (1971, p. 51) remarks in like manner: " The relativists would suggest that a consensus, where it exists, is often created by the persuasive manipulation of public opinion through means such as the mass media, by groups possessing sufficient power to propagate their own particular values and notions of appropriate and reprehensible behaviour." 1 When conformity is not manipulated, therefore, it is coerced. Coercive confrontations engineered by agents of control are a major theme of the perspective's analysis. These confrontations are tragi-comedies of unintended consequences in which the emerging deviancy is made to serve the agents' institutional needs and " society's " need for moral definition. Agent and 1 Young does in fact later qualify his argument. 142</page><page sequence="5">THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVIANCY AND CONCEPTIONS OF MORAL ORDER deviant are not members of the same universe of discourse. Communication may arise within the special context of the interaction, but it reveals little of either actor's private understanding of the situation. It is a slender bridge spanning irreconcilable worlds. The agent's greatly superior power forces the deviant into some form of sustained interaction. Without that power, communication could not take place at all. Political and Moral Order as a Marginal Concern Structures of rule-making and enforcement are of paramount importance to the deviancy tradition. They define and shape the basic contours of deviant behaviour. Because the perspective identifies deviation as conse quential rule-breaking, it maintains that deviancy would not exist without them. When analysis proceeds beyond the limited confines of the deviant agent dyad, however, these structures are relegated to a virtually inaccessible periphery. Inaccessibility is both conceptual and physical. Conceptually, the institutional arrangements which order political process are not of a kind which permits the use of Verstehen and phenomenalism. They are too grand and impersonal in scale. At best, separate studies can permit the piecing together of a composite description. The level of abstraction which is required to grasp the whole is inconsistent with " naturalistic faithfulness." Physically, the structures are made inaccessible because they are regarded as no more than the organisational background to encounters between their representatives and rule-breakers. Many of their features are taken to be irrelevant to the perspective's concerns. Rule-making which has not created clearly recognisable deviancy has been ignored. Activities of control agents which have no obvious impact on deviants have similarly been neg lected. The organisational work which makes legislation and policing possible is simply taken on trust. In consequence, the perspective has selectively dwelt on antagonistic transactions which prompt identity trans formations in the deviant. After all, the job of the perspective's adherents is the investigation of matters which are palpably linked to deviancy. Law-giving and social control receive only a partial and unrepresentative reflection. The larger whole which might lend unity and order tojthe fragments has been left untouched. The micro-sociological stance of the perspective has further complicated the treatment of these fragments. Whilst all relations between institutions are mediated by individuals, it does not follow that an adequate under standing of these relations can be managed by reference to the characteristics of individual encounters alone. Yet, because the relations are peripheral and receive scant attention, there is a propensity to employ surreptitiously the language of interpersonal confrontation in their analysis. Matza's invocation of Leviathan as the embodiment of power serves allegorical and rhetorical purposes. It also points to an anthropomorphic handling of the state which dispels the difficulties posed by applying Verstehen to a macro-sociological entity. Isolated fragments of political process are described as if they were explicable in terms of personal process. For instance, 143</page><page sequence="6">PAUL ROCK Rubington and Weinberg (1968, p. 3) phrase the politics of deviancy in a micro-sociological vocabulary: " [The sociologist] focuses on the social definition of deviants. He studies deviance as an interactive process, and this requires him to take the pers pective of those who define a person as being a social deviant. He needs to find out (a) what are the circumstances under which a person gets set apart, henceforth to be considered a deviant ? (b) how is the person cast into that social role ? (c) what actions do others take on the basis of this redefinition of the person? and (d) what value, positive or negative, do they place on the facts of deviance?" Answers to these questions can be framed only within a particular system of concepts. That system cannot encompass the structural arrange ments which organise the contexts of defining encounters. The largest describable unit is the group of labelling agents who are bound by face-to face links. Relations between groups, and relations which do not impinge on the deviant directly, remain unsurveyed. The few deviancy sociologists who have explicitly studied these wider relations resort to some version of the anthropomorphism which I have described. The specific conflict between individual deviants and agents becomes translated into a general conflict between a personalised state and personalised groups of dissenters. Turk (1969, p. 32), for instance, remarks: . . law is directly tied in with social conflicts ; legality depends not upon social control or sovereign intui tions concerning absolute rights and wrongs, but upon the ability of some social groupings jointly to pre-empt the mechanisms for creating, maintaining changing and destroying laws. For the groupings powerful enough to have some impact on the legal process, laws will be rather satisfactory regulative compromises. For those groupings who have lost out, or never really com peted, in the struggle to control legal mechanisms, laws will be edicts. For them, to live in a legal order is to be dominated." Quinney ( 1972) argues : " While law is to protect all citizens, it starts as a tool of the dominant class and ends by maintaining the dominance of that class. Law serves the powerful against the powerless. Moreover, law is used by the state (and its elitist government) to promote and protect itself." Although there are exceptions, it is most difficult to discover in the writings on deviancy a description of legislation and rule-making which embodies more than anthropomorphic conspiracy theory. There is little conception of history. If the social contract was not imposed today, it was certainly imposed in the recent past. The contract conceived by the deviancy theorists contains a pristine set of vested interests which have not lost their immediate connections with a dominating elite. The perspective offers no understanding of law as a complex and variegated rule-system whose origins are frequently as mysterious to elites as to governed. It offers no vision of a legal system as a series of constraints upon law-giver and ruled alike. It does not refer to legitimacy and authority other than in the context of manipulation and mystification. It does not provide for the elaborate patterns of accommodation that characterise many situations of social control. The law-giver is an Olympian figure endowed with a rationality, 144</page><page sequence="7">THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVIANCY AND CONCEPTIONS OF MORAL ORDER an innocence of unintended consequences, and a clear self-interestedness. He stands aloof from the effects of the deviousness which Quinney (1972, p. 28) describes: . . we have taken at face value the belief that law is an absolute good in itself. Order, as well, has become an absolute value, a value that actually benefits those who rule at the expense of those who are ruled. Because of this indoctrination, many citizens today are willing to take up the law and order challenge that is being perpetuated by the power structure. Those not falling for this devious scheme are the ones who are feeling the actual pains of repression." Such a legislator is a strange creature to discover in sociological analysis. He lacks plausibility, if only because it is difficult to conceive of a powerful group which is utterly emancipated from the commonsense ideas that prevail amongst the powerless. As Manning observes (1972, p. 11), " the overall impression is one of enormous simplification, reification and an almost appalling absence of sensitivity to the complexity of human social interaction."But the origins of such a caricatured figure are quite intelligible. He is the natural outcome of an analysis which lacks a sense of history, a sensitivity to institutional patterns, and a range which is wider than a narrow focus upon encounters between deviants and officials. Like the urban villagers of Gans' ethnography, the deviancy theorists cannot discuss abstract bureaucratic process in language other than that of personal morality. It is nevertheless important to appreciate that anthropomorphism may well have a significant part to play in explanations of rule-making processes. It is plausible that legislators, diplomats and others account for their activities in a commonsense fashion which necessarily relies on some anthro pomorphic imagery. " The state," the " party " or the " country " are awarded needs, dispositions and qualities which render them manageable for political purposes. Thus, in certain settings, people do act as if the social reality of the deviancy theorists were valid. There is consequently some fit between the theorists' descriptions and the behaviour that is de scribed. Politicians may engage in conspiracy; they may personalise their adversaries ; they may respond only to a loosely constructed present. How ever, a commonsense rendition of commonsense understanding does not substantially advance sociological appreciation. Although theorists and actors may inhabit the same world of phenomenological fact, a reasonable detachment from that world is a vital pre-requisite of useful analysis. Many of the perspective's deformations can also be attributed to the assumptions which underpin ideas of pluralism and absolutism. The nature of moral systems should exercise much of the theorists' thinking. Increasingly, the sociology of deviancy is becoming defined as the study of the manufacture and application of rules. (Douglas, 1970) Yet there has been virtually no explication of the issues raised by this change of focus. (Hempel, 1952, p. 11.) New analytic matters may have been introduced, but their introduc tion has not been accompanied by any sense of uncertainty or curiosity. Thus, generally, the problems of morid order have been dispelled by fiat. No intellectual effort has been devoted to elucidating the nature of "values," " definitions of the situation," " rules " and the like. 145</page><page sequence="8">PAUL ROCK Such critically important concepts have remained somewhat empty and formless. Instead of emphasising the complexity of the phenomena which they describe, they have reduced them to a state of misleading simplicity. Rather than convey a model of moral life as densely textured and intricate, they have constructed a kind of sociological Flatland which contains no topographical features other than the boundaries which separate different regions. Relations between the " values " espoused by an individual or a group are correspondingly simple. There is no possibility of irony because analytically deeper connections are not envisaged. Values are therefore in conflict or in harmony: conflict cannot be studied as a manifestation of underlying consensus, and consensus cannot generate conflict. The schisms which divided the Stalinist and the Trotskyite, the paedobaptist and the Plymouth Brother, the Amish and the Mennonite, would be refracted into a simple pluralism with no uniting structures of belief. At the level of elementary phenomenalism, all the features of a moral order are collapsed into the two dimensional world of the surface. Flatland cannot be other than pluralist. Because a Flatland approach cannot envisage " values " as multi tiered, and complex in their relations, it gives rise to simplistic images of the nature of consensus, conflict and pluralism. It tends to engender blanket designations of situations which ignore all their internal heterogeneity. It is indeed rare that all the moral components of a situation can be charac terised so neatly. Rather, each of these master terms will be appropriate to some of its important features. When worlds are compared, it is essential to specify which of their components are under survey. Without such precise specification, analysis can be grossly misleading. It will instead be a mere caricature whose coherence flows from the grouping together of a few features which have been wrenched from a more ambiguous and recalcitrant whole. Because no area of two-dimensional space can be occupied by more than one element, moral choices must be made between discrete alternatives. Men may, for instance, adhere either to deviant values or to some version of absolutism. Only a few deviancy sociologists suggest that they can support more than one set of " values " simultaneously; that " values " are not neatly separable from one another in all settings; or that contexts play a vital role in shaping which " values " will become salient and what signi ficance they will acquire. An ideal-typical Flatland belief system is articulate, contained and coherent. There is no fuzziness or obscurity or contamination. The system is almost invariably portrayed as a clear and independent perspective on the world. This kind of description seems to be a recurrent result of attempts to translate beliefs into an analytically manageable form. As Shils (1968, p. 262) remarks: " Because of vagueness, ambiguity, unsystematic character, and variations in level of abstraction, actually held beliefs are difficult to describe, and there is a tendency on the part of sociological and anthro pological analysts to systematize, clarify, and specify actually held beliefs to a point which makes the holder of such beliefs appear to be a systematic philosopher." 146</page><page sequence="9">THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVIANCY AND CONCEPTIONS OF MORAL ORDER The systematic philosophers created by the theorists occupy neatly defined deviant worlds which are cut off from other styles of moral under standing. Their lives are predominantly organised around their deviancy. The drug-taker, the delinquent, and the politicised deviant are saturated with their distinct life-styles. The theorists' singular focus throws only what is deviant into relief. They impute coherence, solidity and discreteness to a phenomenon which appears to have a rather shadowy existence in everyday life. (Rock, 1973.) In so doing, they engage in reification because, in most situations and at most times, deviants are not deviant at all. The representation of society as radically pluralist becomes possible when specific kinds of value are held in a specific focus. To ignore the rest is to ignore the major part of the interpretative and communicative work which gives substance to social life. Not only is there a denial of complexity and ambiguity, there is a failure to differentiate between kinds of value. It seems to be assumed that notions concerning, say, murder, clothing, marihuana and chocolate are all inter changeable analytic units. Such notions are not subdivided into the ephe meral and the enduring; the general and the local; the compelling and the not compelling; the organised and the organising. Every " value " is much the same as any other; it is not distinguished by any peculiar place in the moral order of a community. The perspective's treatment of moral topography is further complicated by the unacknowledged ignorance which surrounds the area. The " absolutist " is criticised for improperly endowing society with consensus, but the dissensus postulated by the deviancy theorists is based on a very slight foundation. Despite the apparent confidence with which ideas of moral and political organisation are discussed by the perspective, there has been virtually no fieldwork aimed at uncovering the distribution and nature of morals and beliefs. We simply do not know how the members of British or American society order their understanding of deviancy and its attendant issues. By default, simple stereotypes of " middle-class reactions " or " ruling class ideology " play an important and probably mischievous role in explana tion. The occasional attitude survey does not substantially meet this problem. It is typically couched in the language of Flatland and cannot provide access to the contextual determination of meaning or the relations between meanings. More useful work would be informed by an alternative conception of moral order. Such work would follow the model of eidectic reduction: a progressive stripping away of layers of meaning in an attempt to lay bare the physiology of a moral system. It would proceed on the assumption that it is possible to discover tiers and clusters of meaning, each with its own contours, and each related to some larger principle of stratification. (Ladd, I957)2 Át the deeper levels, it might unearth understandings which are so universally taken for granted that they are not even noticed by those who maintain them. These background beliefs permit transactions to develop between structurally distant groups. What the deviancy theorists have 2 Ladd has performed some pioneering work in this direction. 147</page><page sequence="10">PAUL ROCK generally neglected is that quite detailed communication is possible between seemingly disparate groups. What may be treated on one level as pluralism can, on another, be seen as participation in a common universe of linguistic, symbolic and gestural styles. Despite all the diversity of British society, almost any of its members can engage in some sustained interaction with any other member. Amongst the higher strata of values, the topography would encounter outcrops which are salient and obtrusive. Such outcrops might well describe novel and contentious social phenomena which are in open dispute. Many of the deviancies conventionally studied by the perspective would be located in these areas. However isolated or unusual these outcrops might seem to be, they can be traced back to the more fundamental strata upon which they rest and from which they take some of their character. As I have argued, it may well be that much apparent pluralism is no more than a surface phenomenon. Conflicts revolving around life-styles, around the distribution of privilege, and around the import of fundamental social categories, may not be able to develop unless there is an initial pool of shared understandings about the significance of the things that are at issue. At a distance, many opposed groups are merely warring within the confines of a consensus. It does not follow that deviants and those who are engaged in their control do not define their relations solely in terms of conflict or competition. They will interpret their acts in phenomenally immediate terms. Yet the first-order constructs employed by these actors should not be accepted as definitive by the sociologist. Such an acceptance merely warps analysis. As Manning (1972, p.12) argues, the deviancy perspective typically " assumes the ' underdog's ' narrow, often very simplistic view of large, complex social segments which directly affect changes in the underdog's behaviour." The abundance of common meanings that are shared by both actors is analytically important although it may be obscure to them. On inspection, the policeman and delinquent, prison officer and prisoner, bailiff and debtor, judge and defendant, are the inhabitants of a world which is marked by pluralism and absolutism, consensus and dissensus, conflict and unity. It is the disentangling of these features, the mapping out of their connections, and the understanding of their effects that is the critical research task, not the simple application of a few over-arching concepts.
