<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading The Great Gatsby in New Jersey: Responses to Fitzgerald in Richard Ford's Bascombe Trilogy: The Sportswriter (1986), Independence Day (1995), and The Lay of the Land (2006) HORST KRUSE I. Richard Anderson's essay "Gatsby's Long Shadow: Influence and Endurance" includes an extensive list of novels and stories which "pay homage to the impress of The Great Gatsby " (36). The presence of Gatsby in these works ranges from "insistent tribute" and recognition of Fitzgerald's "magnitude of achievement" all the way to "casually . . . allusive comparison" (14). Additions to the list over the past two decades have continued to fall within this range. But the most prominent instance of an account of the reception of The Great Gatsby occurs in a work that does not come under the heading of fiction at all: - in Azar Nafisi's Reading Lolita in Tehran (2003). Subtitled "A Memoir in Books," the work sets out to detail, along with other contentions of similar nature, a violent contest over the proper way of reading Fitzgerald's novel in revolutionary Iran. What Nafisi has to say about Nabokov's Lolita in the first section of her book also holds for Fitzgerald's novel in her second section: it is ultimately the story of how The Great Gatsby "gave a different color to Tehran and how Tehran helped redefine [Fitzgerald's] novel" (6). The prominent position of Nafisi's book among instances of the reception of The Great Gatsby is due to the obvious clash that exists between the world of fiction (that of the American Twenties) and the world of its readers (that of Revolutionary Iran), a clash of civilizations reflected in the distance in time as well as space between the two worlds. While it is distance and the ensuing clash of civilizations that are at the heart of the problems experienced and described by Nafisi, it is proximity, the very lack of distance, that is at the root of the predicament resulting from an encounter with Fitzgerald and his novel described in another recent non- fiction account - in a book by J. R. Moehringer entitled The Tender Bar (2005) and also identified by its subtitle as "A Memoir." Living in the Long Island ©2010 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Society/Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 208 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 8, 2010</page><page sequence="2">READING THE GREAT G A T S B Y town of Manhasset, the place which Fitzgerald turned into the East Egg of his novel, Moehringer relates how he and his friends "strode each day across Fitzgerald's abandoned stage set" and how they "romanced one another among his ruins" (6). An aspiring writer at age twenty-three determined to write an autobiographical novel, he suffers from writer's block and explains how he would "grow angry with Fitzgerald": "Bad enough that he'd set an unreachable standard of perfection, that he'd already written the Greatest American Novel, but did he have to set it in my hometown? I'd think about my favorite novels - The Great Gatsby , David Copperfield , The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , The Catcher in the Rye - and their brilliance would paralyze me" (280). Both memoirs, then, demonstrate the importance of place in the reception of The Great Gatsby , and both conversely demonstrate the contribution that The Great Gatsby makes to the actual construction of place in these works. It is these two aspects of the impact of Fitzgerald's novel that I want to pursue in Richard Ford's Bascombe trilogy, in what appears to be the most prominent instance of a response to The Great Gatsby in the past two decades as well as one of the most deliberate and sophisticated attempts to construct place in fiction. II. The three novels, The Sportswriter (1986), Independence Day (1995) and The Lay of the Land (2006), that make up the Bascombe trilogy are all set in New Jersey; in the first two novels in the town of Haddam ("a fictional composite of Princeton, Hopewell and Pennington," but probably taking its name from the "thin men of Haddam" in Wallace Stevens's poem "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird"), in the last novel in a place on the Jersey Shore called Sea-Clift ("a version of Seaside Heights, Seaside Park and Ortley Beach" [McGrath 1]). Frank Bascombe, the first-person narrator-protagonist, is the author of an early successful collection of short stories, who moved to Haddam to complete (and ultimately failed to complete) his first novel, then turned his back on literature to work as a sportswriter, and after that became a thriving real estate broker. His decision to live in New Jersey is deliberate, and his feeling for New Jersey as a place is affirmed from the very first to the very last of the more than 1300 pages of the trilogy. It involves an outright rejection of life in New York City (in Gotham, as he calls it) and can be traced to the influence of William Faulkner and the portrayal of his Yoknapatawpha County. Evading imitation of the work of the fellow-Southerner by deciding on a different region (but nonetheless planting references to The Sound and the Fury in having The Sportswriter take place over Easter, and by naming Bascombe after Mrs. Compson's often invoked maiden name, as well as by choosing a narrator as obsessed as Quentin The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 8, 2010 209</page><page sequence="3">HORST KRUSE Compson is about telling his story), Ford creates his own version of regional avowal. Frank Bascombe moves in two steps from writing literature toward a kind of work that involves more immediate social immersion and direct contact with the realities of contemporary American life (albeit through becoming a realtor and thus sharing in what according to Faulkner is the original sin of land ownership). And he rejects "the transcendent themes in life" (Sportswriter 16) and in his work as a sportswriter opts for "sentences that are meant to be read, not mused over" (Sportswriter 143). But, ironically, Ford has him retain his apparent fondness for, and memory of, an enormous store of literary works - novels, stories, poems, as well as essays - and he draws on such works in cryptic or conspicuous quotation to structure the flow of narration and to emphasize the dominant thematic concerns of his trilogy. When Bascombe notices "a dog-eared copy of [William Carlos Williams's] Paterson' ' on the desk of a new colleague, he automatically concludes that the colleague "probably had life in pretty much the right perspective" ( Independence 112-13). The implicit approval of Williams's programmatic credo "No ideas but in things" is reflected in Bascombe's rejection of the "transcendent themes in life." At the same time Williams's devotion to New Jersey as locale supports the strong sense of place that pervades the trilogy. Conspicuous and cryptic quotations and references are thus perceived and exploited as markers which function in geographic as well as in thematic terms, and The Great Gatsby as referent would seem to play a major role in this procedure. At one point in the course of The Lay of the Land , we see Bascombe charting, as it were, his position on the Jersey Shore in relation to the denouement in Fitzgerald's novel as having been "transacted scarcely a hundred miles from here as the gull flies" (326). This is an instance, one of several, of how the older author serves the younger in the construction of his Jersey-centered microcosm and its embeddedness in the broader lay of the land. III. In his Esquire essay "The Three Kings: Hemingway, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald" (1983), which by three years preceded the publication of the first volume of the Bascombe trilogy, Ford has praise for all these authors: "As writers whose work taught me serviceable lessons about writing at a formative age, all three get high marks for mentorship" (584). He admits to having reread The Great Gatsby "for possibly the fourth time" (582). Yet he feels that "Influence ... is a hard business to assess" and probably also a matter to be anxious about, since "no one who's any good ever wants to write like anyone else" (584). But it is 210 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re view, Vol. 8, 2010</page><page sequence="4">READING THE GREAT G A T S B Y difficult not to perceive Fitzgerald as a model in some sections where neither his name nor the title of The Great Gatsby is actually mentioned. The first of such scenes occurs in The Sportswriter and is laid at nightfall in a boat off the coast, with the solitary narrator "staring off at the jeweled shore lights of New Jersey, brightening as dark fell, and feeling full of wonder and illusion - like a Columbus or a pilgrim seeing the continent of his dreams take shape in the dusk for the first time" (83-84). Though much shorter than the description of Nick Carraway's final vision on the beach of Long Island Sound, Bascombe's words nonetheless evoke Fitzgerald's text and invite the reader to observe Ford positioning himself in relation to the older writer by presenting a version not only set in another state, but in its comparative briefness staying closer to a sportswriteťs prose than to the style of what the narrator himself refers to as "the real writers" (Sportswriter 131). In a like manner, a library scene in Independence Day evokes its con- spicuous antecedent in The Great Gatsby. Both the library at the Deerslayer Inn at Cooperstown and its more spectacular counterpart in Gatsby's mansion are furnished with materials that have seen previous use. Gatsby's "high Gothic library" is "panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas" (37). On a somewhat more modest scale, the Inn's library is an "old wainscoted parlor lined with oak bookshelves, a full complement of cast-off butler and drumhead tables, slipcovered couches, wob- bly hassocks, nautical-looking brass lamps - all scavenged at antique fairs and roadside flea markets in the Cortland-Binghamton-Oneonta triangle" (319). While the visitor to the showy splendor of Gatsby's library is surprised to learn that its books are real, "[absolutely real - have pages and everything" (38), even though these pages turn out not to have been cut, there is an unexpected turn of quite a similar sort in the case of Ford's rendition of the "librarial moment" (322). Bascombe browses "down the shelf containing stiff bound editions of New York History , the Otsego Times , The Encyclopedia of Collectibles , American Cage Bird magazine, Mechanix Illustrated , Hersey's Hiroshima in three different editions, two whole yards of matched Fenimore Coopers, a Golden Treasury of Quotable Poetry , two volumes of Rails of the World , surprisingly enough another Classic Holes of Golf , a stack of recent Hartford Courants ..." (319). All these items are real, to be sure, but Bascombe is in for a surprise when he learns from an employee that they were never really intended as actual reading matter: "I didn't know anybody ever read those books. I thought they were just to make the room look cozy." The owner, he is told, "buys 'em by the metric ton from some recycler up in Albany" (323) - clearly, like Gatsby, the proprietor of the Deerslayer Inn is "a regular Belasco" (38). But what appears to be just an ingenious playful response to a classic scene (reaching back perhaps The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 8, 2010 211</page><page sequence="5">HORST KRUSE to include the impressive library at Bellomont in Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth [1905], to which its heirs "had made no perceptible additions" and which "was in fact never used for reading, though it had a certain popularity as a smoking-room or a quiet retreat for flirtation" [59] x) does indeed provide its own variation on the theme of illusion versus reality as developed in The Great Gatsby and thus promotes the central quest for reality, for what is real, on the part of both the protagonist and the author of the Bascombe novels. A more complex instance of intertextual engagement between the Bas- combe trilogy and The Great Gatsby emerges from the following cluster of oblique and outright references in chapter 8 of Independence Day , the middle volume. This section with its description of the narrator's Fourth-of-July trip with his teenage son Paul from Deep River in Connecticut to Cooperstown in upstate New York shows us Bascombe reading the landscape ("literary and history-soaked" as it is [286]) with his habitual attention to detail and significance. At a brief scenic turnout, he gets out of the car, leaving his sulky son in the seat with his New Yorker and his walkman (both items that keep him from perceiving reality): ... I climb out into the little breezy lot and walk to the sand- stone parapet beyond which the luminous Pleistocene valley leaps out stark and vast and green and brown-peaked with the animal grandeur of an inland empire any bona fide pioneer would've quaked before trying to tame Beyond me hawks soar, martins dip, a tiny airplane buzzes, a distant hang glider like a dragonfly wheels and sways in the rising molecules. A door in a far-off, invisible house slams audibly shut, a car horn blows, a dog barks. And visible on the hillside opposite, where the sun paints a yellow square upon the western gradient, a tractor, tiny but detectably red, halts its progress in an emerald field; a tiny, hatted figure climbs down, pauses, then starts on foot back up the hill he's tractored down. He moves for a long, slow ways above and away from his machine, turns and goes a distance along a curved rim top, then resolutely, undramatically goes over, disappears at his own pace to whatever world's beyond, It is a fine moment to savor, even alone, though I wish my son could break loose and share it. (286-87) The elevating experience induces the narrator's next move. "Satisfied and palpably enlivened," he turns "to pack it in," but he notices that Somebody has left a plastic bag of Styrofoam "popcorn" half out of the trash can A new warm afternoon breeze is shifting wispy kernels here and there around the lot. I stop before climbing in to 212 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Review, Vo l. 8, 2010</page><page sequence="6">READING THE GREAT G A T S B Y jam the bag down farther and to police up what bits I can with two hands. (287) As he does so, his son looks up and stares at his father where he is "tidying up the asphalt around the car" and proceeds to express his disapproval in slow pantomime. Both passages as well as their collocation take us to the ending of The Great Gatsby. Bascombe's solitary meditation is not unlike that of Nick Carraway when he ponders the course of history as he looks out on Long Island Sound. And Bascombe's all-but-instinctive reaction to the refuse instantly calls to mind the brief view of Gatsby's house immediately preceding Carraway's meditation: "On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone" (140). To corroborate our speculation as to where the inspiration for both aspects of the scene is to be found, the text of the novel goes on to provide a direct reference to Fitzgerald, which at the same time serves to bracket the two oblique references. Continuing his ruminations about the area they are traversing, Bascombe arrives at the following conclusion which would seem to betray regional partiality along with a realtor's appreciation: "Geography, while instructive, is also the Northeast's soundest selling point and best-kept secret, since in three hours you can stand on the lapping shores of Long Island Sound, staring like Jay Gatsby at a beacon light that lures you to, or away from, your fate; yet in three hours you can be heading for cocktails damn near where old Natty drew first blood - the two locales as unalike as Seattle is to Waco" (288). Citing the immemorial protagonists of the two authors in their greatest moments enhances the description and illuminates historical as well as geographical opposi tes. IV. The most prominent invocation of The Great Gatsby occurs in The Lay of the Land, the last volume of the trilogy. The conclusion of the work has Frank Bascombe arrive at what he himself calls his Permanent Period, which involves his ultimate conversion from dreamy evasiveness to the acceptance of reality. Of the large number of literary texts called on throughout the trilogy to elucidate plot and theme, it is Fitzgerald's novel which has been singled out by the author to illuminate the final phase of his protagonist's progress. The events are set in the year 2000, in "the waning weeks of [the] millennial year" (6), and many of these events augur significant changes. So also on the eve of Thanksgiving, when Bascombe drives over to watch the The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 8, 2010 213</page><page sequence="7">HORST KRUSE carefully staged implosion of the historic Queen Regent Hotel, an Asbury Park landmark. When he returns to his car he finds one of its windows broken, and after a long search he manages to locate a garage in Manasquan which is still open for business: "A long-legged, peroxided, pimpled kid with tattoos on his arms . . . sits in a tipped-back dinette chair across the tiny overheated office, bent over a foxed copy of The Great Gatsby - the old green-gray-and- white Scribner Library edition I read in 'American Existentialism and Beyond' in Ann Arbor in 1964" (326). Bascombe thinks back on his encounters with the novel, and he implicitly stresses its importance to the nation at large: "For decades, I reread it every year, exactly the way we're all supposed to." But then, surprisingly, he goes on to explain that he "got sick of its lapidary certainties disguised as spoiled innocence" ("Something I don't believe in," as he puts it) and "gave [his] last copy to the Toms River Shriners' Xmas Benefit." What for a book lover like Bascombe seems a drastic measure of rejection is modified, however, by his perfect memory of the text as well as his continu- ing emotional response to it. He instantly remembers that "Garage mechanics, of course, play a pivotal role in Fitzgerald's denouement" and he proceeds (as has been indicated) to place the present New Jersey setting in relation to that of the ending of the novel, "transacted scarcely a hundred miles from here as the gull flies" (326). Bascombe's concern with the book continues while he discusses details of the repair job at hand; he sees the boy as he "looks back with interest to his page," realizes that in his reading he is "near the end, where Meyer Wolfsheim says, 'When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out,' " which he considers sound advice. Even as he leaves to go to a neighboring bar to wait for the repair to be done, Fitzgerald's novel is still on his mind, with Bascombe continuing to interpret the scene in terms of its components. Apparently recalling Wolfsheim's references to Gatsby's and to Nick's college education, he takes the mechanic named Chris to be a "Monmouth College student on Thanksgiving break, the first of his immigrant family to blub, blub, blub." Further, he is tempted "to poll [Chris's] views about Jay Gatz. Victim? Ill-starred innocent? Gray-tinged antihero? Or all three at once, vividly registering Fitzgerald's glum assessment of our century's plight - now blessedly at an end." He also notes the disparity between the imagery of the "boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past" and that of a similar parable that he has just heard, and he refers to the author of the latter as a "Nick Carraway doppelganger" (327). This emphatic response to The Great Gatsby has its telling counterpart when Bascombe returns to pick up his car several hours later. What has happened in the interval is a climactic experience in Bascombe's long quest to achieve ultimate reconciliation with reality. Reading, under the somewhat 214 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Review, Vol. 8, 2010</page><page sequence="8">READING THE GREAT G A T S B Y unusual circumstances in the bar, the short biography of another real estate broker who has lost a boy precipitates his readiness to accept the finality of the death of his son Ralph that occurred all of nineteen years earlier. Reaching this final state of acceptance - accepting his "whole life" and his "whole self in it" (358) - implies completion of the long "trajectory from seeming to being" (Walker 162) - in terms of the trilogy's overriding thematic as well as its poetological concern - and has Bascombe return to the scene of his first encounter with the novel-reading mechanic a different man. He now begins to see Chris for what he really is: not "a struggling American Existentialist scholarship boy at Monmouth, but a sweet, knuckleheaded grease monkey weighing a stint in trade school or the Navy. He is who he ought to be." Bas- combe's insight and concomitant self-assessment continue to grow: "Possibly he's older than he looks. Possibly he's not even Greek. Possibly he's a father himself. Why do we think we know anything?" (352). Extricating himself from viewing the world through Fitzgerald's novel thus is an achievement that proceeds from Bascombe's conversion to reality, and while Ford has the novel reflect rather than actually produce the conversion, he has The Great Gatsby serve as the important touchstone. What survives for Bascombe as he turns to face the realities of life is the novel's abiding metaphor, its final image which, rather than partake of the text's "lapidary certainties disguised as spoiled innocence," bluntly affirms life's challenges: wishing the mechanic a "Happy Thanksgiving," Bascombe concludes, "We are beating on, Chris and me, against the current" (353). V. Much like the strategy of Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby that of Ford in the Bascombe novels is the strategy of the successful novelist of ideas who finds devices of plot and action (along with monologue and dialogue) to negotiate his thematic concerns. Responses to Fitzgerald's novel become part of the strategy. Introducing identifiable copies of The Great Gatsby (the Scribner Library edition SL #1, the prevalent classroom text of the 1960s and early 1970s), placing them in the hands of a student in a literature seminar of 1964 and (a "foxed copy") in the hands of a mechanic in the millennium year, having the older reader get rid of his copy whereas the younger reader picks one up of his own accord and hangs on to the book during the discussion of his business - these details, while providing reliable data regarding the reception and the continued popularity of the novel, point to a more important role of the book in the Bascombe trilogy. They reflect the impact that the novel has had (and continues to have, now that a "foxed copy" has trickled down to an unlikely reader) in shaping the ways in which we interpret the realities of The F. Scott Fitzgerald Review, Vo l. 8, 2010 215</page><page sequence="9">HORST KRUSE life. Right up to the point of his conversion Bascombe is apparently unable to free himself from its influence on his thinking; its hold on him, as we learn, has prevailed long after he had rejected what he had begun to consider the "lapidary certainties" of the work and thus gotten rid of his last copy of it. Ford asserts the finality and the importance of Bascombe's conversion and deliberately installs the teachings of William Carlos Williams's Pater son and the poetry of Wallace Stevens as new texts. By having him develop and practice a more realistic credo of his own, in other words: have him proceed from seeming to being as he enters the twenty-first century, the author deliberately places his protagonist in a New Jersey context (as opposed to that of Gotham) in the moral geography of the trilogy. All dominant concerns converge in the follow- ing passage, in its oblique reference to Stevens's "The Emperor of Ice-Cream" (1922) with its climactic invocation, "Let be be finale of seem," and in its very tangible expression of regional identification through anthropomorphic description of direct physical contact of man and nature: On the day I got home from the hospital, the weather turned ice- cream nice, and the low noon sun made the Atlantic purple and flat, then suddenly glow as the tide withdrew. And once again I was lured out, my pants legs rolled and in an old green sweatshirt, barefoot, to where the soaked and glistening sand seized my soft feet bottoms and the frothing water raced to close around my ankles like a grasp. And I thought to myself, standing there: Here is necessity. Here is the extra beat - to live, to live, to live it out. (Lay 485) However forceful the thrust of regional identification is in this description of Frank Bascombe's return to the Jersey Shore, on the very last page of the trilogy, it would seem that even here the author invokes the images of Gatsby and of Nick, "on the lapping shores of Long Island Sound," "scarcely a hundred miles from here as the gull flies," to achieve his own denouement in deliberate intertextual dialogue with Fitzgerald's novel of eighty years earlier - clearly affirming his own position on Jersey soil as much as in the twenty-first century, nonetheless using The Great Gatsby to place an immaterial but permanent historical marker in the American landscape, literary as well as topographical. Notes A prominent feature of his work, Ford's strategy of conspicuous and cryptic quo- tation, has been commented on and investigated in several critical studies of his writings, such as Laura Barton's "Other Voices, Other Rooms," Fred Hobson's "The Sportswriter: Post-Faulkner, Post-Southern?" and Elinor Walker's Richard Ford.
