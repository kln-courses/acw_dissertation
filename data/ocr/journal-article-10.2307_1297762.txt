<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDIEVAL MEDICINE The Medieval Health Handbook- Tacuinum Sanitatis, by Luisa Cogliati Arano (translated and adapted by Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook from the original Italian edition). George Brazil- ler, Inc., New York, 1976, 153 p., illus., $25.00 (75-21725). Here is a surprising, fascinating, beauti- ful book-one characterized by fine scholarship-that takes us back six or seven hundred years in our thinking about health and medicine. Tacuinum Sanitatis is a collection of illustrated plates and their legends, compiled from five illuminated manuscripts of great importance in the development of medi- cal botany and the herbals of the Middle Ages and later. These manuscripts for the most part were overlooked until recent times. The five documents, all related in style and content, are the Tacuinum of Liege, the Tacuinum of Paris, the Tacuinum of MODELING CELL REARRANGEMENT Mathematical Models for Cell Rear- rangement, edited by G. D. Mostow. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn., 1975, 271 p., illus., $17.50 (74-29731). This book contains a valuable review of work on the theory of cell rearrange- ment processes, which is central to the study of morphogenesis. Through it, four papers by Pyatevskii-Shapiro et al. and one by A. V. Vasiliev are now made accessible to English-speaking scientists, thanks to translation by Y6as. The balance of the book consists of seven American papers, starting with Stein- berg's pioneering paper in Science (1963), which began this particular di- rection of work. Richard Campbell's 22-page annotated bibliography of the subject (including comments on the papers in this book) will be invaluable for any future workers in the field. The bibliographies of the papers demon- strate the need for this book: The American authors cite the Russians even less than the Russians do the Western papers. The principal characterization of these papers is that they are far more con- cerned with operating the mathematical models than with testing predictions which come out of the mathe- matics. This appears to be more true of the Russian work than of the Ameri- Vienna, the Theatrum of the Casana- tense Library in Rome, and the Tacui- num of Rouen. They appear to have been produced during the last two decades of the 1300's and 1400's in the Po Valley of Italy. Each is thoroughly considered in the scholarly text that precedes the reproduction of a selection of the illustrations and their respective texts. The first clues to their existence came in 1895, 1896, and 1905 for the first three; the last two, although named in library lists earlier, were actually made known only during the 1950's. Each document comprises an illustrated manuscript with succinct commentaries for each plate. All bear the characteris- tic of work done in the Po Valley during the so-called Gothic Period. Further- more, although each was obviously the work of a different author, they all show in their texts and illustrations the mark of Arabian medicine. It is prob- able that the Arabic culture in Spain influenced the preparation of these health books. At least the source of inspiration of form of the Tacuina may can. It is not clear whether this charac- teristic reflects a philosophical attitude or the collective conclusion that Stein- berg's basic concepts need no further proof. If the latter is the authors' motivation, then I believe they are correct. Still, it would have been valu- able if more of their discussions had been carried further to the point where testable predictions were clearly stated. Thus, the book's title is valid, in that it refers more to mathematical models of, and not to the physical explanation for, cell rearrangement. Perhaps it is still a bit early to ask for a comprehensive explanation; if so, then this book will be an important help to those who seek such explanations in the future. A major part of the scientific explana- tion for a phenomenon, such as cell rearrangement, must be the demonstra- tion that the phenomenon (together with all that is involved in it) is com- patible with the rest of science. A vitalistic theory for cell rearrangement would "explain" everything, of course. But it would lead nowhere, in a large part because it would be incompatible with physics and physical chemistry. It is, quite possibly, in the breaking down of one of the few remaining bastions of vitalism that the physical theory of cell rearrangement serves biological science the best. ROBERT J. GOOD Department of Chemical Engineering State University of New York Buffalo, NY 14214 have been the historic Arabian physician Ibn Botlan of whose writings there are still extant a number in Arabic. The Tacuina, although not directly of his writing, may be considered to represent a kind of synthesis of them. The very term Tacuina comes from the Arabic taqwtn, meaning "tables," in reference to the legends beneath each illustration and outlining the nature, usefulness, dangers, antidotes, etc. of the subject of each plate. This artistically produced volume pre- sents 48 full-page color plates with the respective "tables" or texts. These are followed by 243 smaller illustrations, with texts, in black and white. Most of the plates represent plants. Of particular interest is No. XX (from the Tacuinum of Vienna)-the Fruit of the Man- dragora. It figures a man together with a dog tied by a rope to the neck of a highly anthropomorphic root of the mandrake-an early representation of the curious method of collecting this toxic and narcotic root and the beliefs that persisted for hundreds of years that any person pulling the root himself would be, driven mad by the shrieks emanating from the plant. The "table" for this illustration reads: "Nature: Cold in the third degree, dry in the second. Optimum: The highly fragrant variety. Usefulness: Smelling it helps alleviate headaches and insomnia; spreading it on the skin works against elephantiasis and black infections. Dangers: It stupefies the senses. Neutralization of the Dan- gers: With the fruits of ivy. Effects: It is not comestible. It is good for warm temperaments, for the young, in Sum- mer, and in the Southern regions." Following the plates and their "tables" there is a complete Table of Concor- dance and a Bibliography. This volume is an extraordinary contri- bution to the history of medicine, to botany, to disciplines studying lifestyles of the 1300's and 1400's in Europe. It may immediately be recommended for all interdisciplinary libraries and re- search centers, and it will be extremely helpful as collateral reading in university courses. The publisher has done a masterly job in high quality of publication, and, in this way, he has kept faith with the level of scholarship of the author. For the price, the book is a gem.
