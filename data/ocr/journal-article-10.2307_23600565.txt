<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES MOSAIC JUDAISM AND JUDAISM OF THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD - THE JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY OF STRABO by Bezalel Bar-Kochva Strabo's ethnographic excursus on the Jews (Geographica XVI, 2, 35-37) is the most enthu siastic account of Jewish origins to reach us from Hellenistic and Roman literature. While earlier scholars attributed it to Posidonius of Apamea, in the last few decades it has been suggested that Strabo himself was the original author, or that he drew on an unknown Stoic philosopher or a Jewish author with a Stoic education. This paper attempts to show that Pos idonius was indeed the original author of the excursus. Major features of the excursus are here analyzed both in their own right and in comparison with parallels from Hellenistic literature. The discussion shows that Strabo did little more than copy the 'account' from his source, which was not Jewish. All the features in fact have extant Posidonian parallels. It is shown that some of these features are exclusively Posidonian, while others may be exclusively Posidonian. Those features that are definitely or possibly not exclusively Posidonian are nevertheless not all found combined in any author. All the signs indicate that Posidonius is the source. Pösidonius' ethnographic account was most probably included as an introduction to the description of Antiochus VII Sidetes siege of Jerusalem in 132 BCE. Posidonius' version was Utopian, rather like his description of the Golden Age, partially preserved in Seneca (Ep. Mor. 90). Posidonius strictly distinguished between ideal (Mosaic) Judaism in the remote past and the degenerate Judaism of his own time. The former was an exclusive, classless society, the state of the wise, living in harmony under the leadership of Moses and his immediate successors, without laws or formal institutions, believing in the Posidonian version of a Stoic divine being, worshiping it in a simple way and in a modest temple devoid of any material representation of the divine, in which select persons maintained communication with the divine being through dream-divination. This community of the wise was located in an unattractive region, where it had no need of military preparations and could instead cultivate good relations with its neighbors, most of whom willingly accepted the Mosaic-Posidonian philosophy. The decline set in with the rule of the 'superstitious' priests and worsened under the (Hasmonean) tyrants, who made the Jews a war-loving nation. What motivated Posidonius to idealize ancient (Mosaic) Judaism? His wild inaccuracies cannot be put down to sheer ignorance, especially considering the proximity of Jews and gentiles in his native city of Apamea; neither, as can be judged from his description of con temporary Judaism, was he concerned to glorify the Jewish people. The explanation is based on the peculiar features of the ethnographic genre, to which the Jewish excursus belongs, and on Posidonius' tendency in other historiographical accounts to mobilize the material in the service of his philosophical conceptions. His Utopian description of the Golden Age is par ticularly suggestive, as it includes several parallels to features in the Jewish excursus. The account of the Golden Age enabled Posidonius to illustrate his ideals in an imaginary society. I suggest that the Jewish ethnography, which was required by the historical context of his narrative, gave him an opportunity to illustrate these ideals in terms of an existing, well</page><page sequence="2">VI ENGLISH SUMMARIES established nation, which would therefore more effectively serve his purposes: his ideal so ciety could still be set up in a less than ideal world, and indeed had existed not long before his time and was practicable as long as the rulers were wise. Posidonius was not doing anything unusual, however; it was common practice among Hellenistic ethnographers to mold and shape the ethnographic material in accordance with their views, and they frequently presented the nation they were describing, or certain of its features, as a model for imitation. The Jews were particularly suitable for Posidonius pur poses, because of the apparent philosophical nature of their religion, which included their monotheistic convictions and their opposition to material and anthropomorphic representa tion of the divine. The apparently good relations between Jews and gentiles in Apamea may also have played a role in his choice. THE GOD OF MOSES ACCORDING TO STRABO by Ivor Ludlam Bezalel Bar-Kochva's paper, appearing in this issue, offers a philological and comparative analysis of Strabo's Jewish ethnography, particularly with regard to its social, political and cultic aspects, which demonstrates that Strabo's source is Posidonius of Apamea, the most prolific Stoic author and historian of the first century bce. Another feature of Strabo's Jewish ethnography, the peculiar conception of the God of Israel, is the subject of the present paper. Philological and philosophical considerations indicate that here, too, Strabo's source is Posidonius. The most problematic sentence in Strabo's account of the God of Israel is the statement, 'For this one thing alone is God, the [thing] encompassing all of us and land and sea - the thing which we call heaven, and universe, and the nature of the things which are'. Scholars have used this sentence both to prove and to disprove a Posidonian source. In fact the sentence cannot be Stoic, let alone Posidonian; at the same time, it may be shown to be alien to its immediate context, a speech delivered by Moses, which is a reworking of an account by Hecataeus. The sentence has been imposed upon the speech, and seems to have replaced some terms by which the deity could be conceived of simultaneously as all-encompassing and all-pervading. The identification of the deity simultaneously with the all-encompassing heaven and the omnipresent kosmos points to a Stoic who not only located the ruling part of the kosmos in the heaven - the outermost sphere of the aither - but also conceived of the substance of this ruling part as informing the rest of the kosmos. That informing substance itself could be said not only to control the universe (as the 'ruling principle', the hegemonikon) but to be the universe. Possible Posidonian evidence that Chrysippus and Zeno held this view must be suspect. Only Posidonius himself conceived the system that could allow such a position. His system, particularly his view of pneuma, is discussed at length in this paper. Hecataeus had portrayed the Jewish God as all-encompassing heaven. Posidonius would have regarded this as only one aspect of his own Stoic god. Therefore, I suggest, he had Moses extend the list of God's attributes to enable the inclusion of two aspects, e.g., heaven, pneuma, hegemonikon (and hence) kosmos. The intermediate hegemonikon or 'ruling principle' is a necessary link, without which the leap from all-encompassing heaven to the kosmos in its entirety is incomprehensible. In Strabo's account, however, the peculiarly Stoic terms have</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES VII been removed and replaced by 'the nature of the things which are', which is coextensive with kosmos but cannot be squared with the all-encompassing heaven. Who could have made such a modification to Posidonius' portrayal of Moses' speech? Posidonius presented his concept of the ruling principle in a peculiarly Posidonian part of Stoic physics which dealt with causes. Strabo, therefore, would have reacted strongly against an appearance of the ruling principle in Moses' speech, where it must have appeared, by replacing it with non-technical terms. Conversely, it may be noted that it is against Posidonius that Strabo rails on the issue of the causes, and not against other geographers. All this indi cates that Strabo is the author of the offending sentence, but that his source was Posidonius. ON THE ROLE OF THE YOZER IN THE LEGACY OF ELEAZAR BI-RABBI QILLIR: NEW FINDINGS by Shulamit Elizur Although many qerovot by R. Eleazar bi-R. Qillir are known to us, both from printed mahzorim and from Geniza fragments, only a few yozerot have hitherto been attributable to him. Thanks to the conclusion of a Qillirian yozer for the Shavuot festival discovered in a Firkovich manuscript, we can now attribute to Qilliri a magnificent yozer belonging to the same system. Besides this new yozer we also cite a parallel Qillirian yozer, only three strophes of which have previously been published, and carefully analyze the relationship between the two yozerot. An additional yozer, possibly attributable to Qilliri, is included in an appendix. ALL ARE INVITED TO READ by Shmuel and Chana Safrai All the evidence indicates that in the early synagogue of the Second Temple period it was customary for one person to read from the Bible. The passage read may have been short, though not less than three verses. One of the religious and liturgical innovations of Yavneh was to introduce several readers, each making the appopriate blessing before and after the reading. The early custom, preserved in the Greek-speaking Diaspora (lo'azot), was later explained by Rabbinic tradition as due to a shortage of knowledgeable readers in the commu nities. Women did not participate in the early ritual, as only one person was involved. Tannaitic tradition maintains that this should be the case in the Diaspora whenever there is only one reader. Once several readers were introduced, women participated as well. The Babylonian Talmud, elaborating on the situation in the Diaspora, introduced the con cept of respect for the community, implying on that socio-religious basis that women should not participate in the reading. The result was that women were eliminated from this part of the public service.</page><page sequence="4">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES HE POSED HIM A DIFFICULTY AND PLACED HIM' - A STUDY IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE TEXT OF TB BAVA KAMA 117a by Adiel Schremer The story of Rav Kahana's escape from Babylonia to Eretz Israel and what happened to him in R. Johanan's academy (TB Bava Kama 117a) is extant in two versions of the text. The better known version is that of the printed editions and most manuscripts; the other may be found in MS Hamburg 165 and a Geniza fragment published by A.I. Katsh, (Ginzei Talmud Babli, Jerusalem 1975, p. 201). The better known, longer version has drawn scholars' attention since it alludes to certain features of an institute for Torah study (academy) in the talmudic period. An attempt is made here to determine the relationship between the two versions of the text, by focusing on a single expression in the version of MS Hamburg and the Geniza fragment (אקשי ליה ואוקמיה) and its parallel in the longer version (אקשי, ואוהביה בדרא קמא). This expres sion, appearing after Rav Kahana's questions to R. Johanan, is extremely rare in the Talmud, and is found elsewhere only once, in the story of צרת הבת (TB Yevamot 16a). Following J. Fraenkel, the present author believes that the expression indicates that a difficulty was posed to a person, who was unable to find an answer; this led to a tense situation. This explanation contributes to a better understanding of the story in Bava Kama and may also shed light on the evolution of the text. It is argued that the common version is secondary, resulting from a misunderstanding of the rare phrase. While the pronominal suffix in the word אוקמיה ('he placed him') should be understood as referring to R. Johanan, to whom Rav Kahana posed questions, it was understood as reflecting the former's reaction to these ques tions, and hence as referring to the latter. As a result of this confusion, the word אוקמיה was understood in a concrete sense, leading in the next stage to its replacement by the more precise word אותביה, 'he set (or placed) him'. Finally the words בדרא קמא were added, that being where Rav Kahana was formally placed. This misunderstanding seems to have occurred at a time when the original meaning of the rare expression was already unknown. It may therefore be assumed that it did not occur in the Amoraic period, when the expression was still in use, but much later - probably somewhere in the Gaonic period; a more precise dating is impossible. OPEN BIBLE CRITICISM IN AN ANONYMOUS COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF PSALMS by Israel M. Ta-Shma A newly discovered Russian manuscript, dated by the copyist's colophon to the year 1285, is a commentary on the Book of Psalms. The first part contains Rashi's commentary, but from Chapter 40 to the very end of the book, without notice, Rashi's commentary is replaced by a previously unknown anonymous work on Psalms, unquestionably of 12th-century French or igin, by some scholar of R. Joseph Kara's circle - possibly R. Joseph Kara himself. The outstanding feature of the commentary is its extreme critical character. The individual psalms are interpreted according to the different historical events which the anonymous com mentator believes formed their background, many of these events having taken place hun dreds of years after the time of King David. This extreme measure of open Bible criticism</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARES IX and peshat methodology is an amazing example of early French Bible criticism; other striking examples, of German Pietist origin, were described in some of the present author's previous articles and are reexamined here. It follows quite clearly that the 12th-century Spanish Bible criticism represented by Abraham ibn Ezra is much less radical and much more covert than the contemporaneous Franco-German parallel. 'THE HISTORICAL BESHT־ - RECONSTRUCTION v*. DECONSTRUCTION by Immanuel Etkes Book Review on: Moshe Rosman, Founder of Hasidism. A Quest for the Historical Bacal Shem Tov, Berkeley 8c Los Angeles (University of California Press) 1966, xi+303 pp. Rosman's book offers a new historical evaluation of the figure of the Besht and the role he played in the emergence of Hasidism. This evaluation is the outcome of a comprehensive, systematic study which aims to reexamine both the findings of previous research and the methodological assumptions underlying it. The two major characteristics of Rosman's study are the standpoint of the social historian and a tendency to adopt a severe, critical position in relation to the reliability of sources. This tendency is influenced by post-modern criticism. These qualities have affected both the struc ture and the content of the book. The first part, 'Context', discusses the historical context in which the Besht lived and acted. The second part, 'Text', proposes a meticulous, systematic examination of the various sources for the Besht's life. The third part, 'Images', is devoted partly to a reconstruction of the figure of the historical Besht and partly to the image of the Besht as seen by Habad Hasidism. This review surveys the chapters of the book in detail, one by one. It demonstrates Rosman's contribution to illuminating the historical context of the Besht's life and activities. His discoveries in archival sources are of particular importance. On the other hand, the present reviewer is critical of some of Rosman's conclusions as to the reliability of the sources. This criticism relates to the possibility of drawing conclusions about the figure of the Besht from the stories in the book Shivhei ha-Besht and of studying the Besht's spiritual world in light of the material cited in his name in the writings of R. Jacob Joseph of Polonne. While Rosman is inclined to doubt the authenticity of these sources, the present author suggests that they be evaluated in a more positive light. In the last part of the book Rosman pictures the Besht as a local bacal shem who earned fame and prestige in the vicinity of Miedzyboz. He is inclined, however, to belittle the Besht's role in the emergence of Hasidism. This reviewer disputes these conclusions and proposes a different evaluation.</page></plain_text>
