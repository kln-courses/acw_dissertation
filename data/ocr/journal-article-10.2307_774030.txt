The use of centuries to mark the eras of western art after the medieval is in order to avoid the usual stylistic di- lemma in which something Gothic is clas- sified as Renaissance or something Neo- classical ends up either as Baroque or Modern. The XYZ division is made up of mis- cellaneous groups of slides which, for a variety of reasons, cannot be included in the previous divisions. It includes ELE- MENTS or principles of the various arts, which cannot be filed with the historical material, PHOTOGRAPHY, PRINTS, and VARIA-miscellaneous minor arts of the twentieth century. Fig. 2 shows the heading and top unit of a five unit slide-order-blank which is used here also as a matrix for illustrating the location of various classification and label entries. The location letters and numbers in ( ) and over the "subscribed" guide entries are not parts of the original blank. They are introduced here in order to facilitate the repeated references to them in connection with the various eras, areas, and arts. By comparing fig. 2 with the outline, with its corresponding letters and numbers in parentheses, and with the sample labels and guide cards illustrated below, the reader can deduce practically all necessary variations in labelling.

DIMITRI TSELOS University of Minnesota OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEW ART Ludwig Hilberseimer It is not nowadays generally known that the author of this article, one of the world's foremost city and regional planners, was for a decade after the First World War among Germany's most penetrating art critics. The present arti- cle, one of many which he wrote for German periodicals in the 20's, was first printed in 1923 in the catalogue of the Gabrielson-G6teburg collection of paint- ings. It was reprinted in 1928 in a special number of the magazine, Kunst der Zeit, edited by Dr. Will Grohmann. In that year Mr. Hilberseimer became pro- fessor of city planning at the Bauhaus in Dessau. He continued in that capacity through all of the vicissitudes of the Bauhaus until it was definitively closed by Hitler in Berlin in 1933. He came to the United States in 1938 on the invitation of the then Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago. From that year to the present he has been professor of city and regional planning at the Armour Insti- tute and its successor, the Illinois Institute of Technology. He is author of eight books on architecture and city and regional planning. It seems to the translator of this article feasible once more to republish it, since its content is still as valid and vital as it was 35 years ago when it was written and since the German version has become very scarce. It is appropriate furthermore, to publish it in English since this will serve to introduce Mr. Hilber- seimer in the role of art connoisseur and critic to the English-reading public al- ready acquainted with his works on architecture and planning.-Howard Dearstyne "Now is the time barbarians are needed. Now is the time it is necessary to have lived very close to God and no longer to study him out of books. One must be able to view the natural life with enchanted eyes; one has to have strength and even 349 Hilberseimer: Observations on the New Art</page><page sequence="2">anger. The time for gentleness and dille- tantism has gone by. The time for pas- sion is beginning." With these words Charles-Louis Philippe characterizes the spiritual physiognomy of the nascent ex- pressionism. Barbarity was for art a means of rejuvenation. Or as Gauguin once said of himself: he went far, far back, farther than to the horses of the Parthenon. back to the hobby horse of his childhood days. Parallel with expressionism and stimu- lated by it, aesthetics has also pressed on- ward to the remotest things. To the most primitive. To the earliest origins. To a comprehension of prehistoric and exotic art and of parallel phenomena of the present day, the creative works of children and the insane. The astonishing, bizarre-grotesque form creations of prehistoric and exotic art are revelations of magic. Manifestations of the metaphysical. Interpretations of spirit- ual experiences in the case of children and the insane. In all cases they represent an intuitive picture of the world. An unshak- able belief in one's own vision. Elements derived from primitive art and the art of children have determined, to a great ex- tent, the form world of expressionism. Al- though it cannot be said that the expres- sionists directly followed these elementary forms, they were nevertheless strongly in- fluenced by them. But far more decisive than form for ex- pressionism was color. Color is its par- ticular domain. The expressionists, adher- ing to the colorful painting of the Middle Ages, used color for its psychological effect. The Russians especially achieved with it the most far-reaching results. Ex- pressionism used the psychological ele- ment of color to create a completely new, transformed world. Color is like music for it, with endless possibilities of variation. It solves the deepest mysteries. The optical picture of the world is suffused with color. Cubism is essentially the composition of a plane surface by means of contrasting divisions. It recognized the fact that a work of art is a self-sufficient organism, constructed in accordance with its own laws. It reverted deliberately to the funda- mental elements of all artistic creation, viz., geometric shapes. It recognized the identity of form and substance. In cubist works texture and a variety of materials never before used in painting are organ- ized into unified compositions. An art prac- tice followed systematically in the Merz pictures.' In spite of its striving for the objective cubism like expressionism ended in sub- jectivity. It persisted in concerning itself far too much with anthropomorphic forms. It is no accident that a new classicism de- veloped out of cubism. Form, along with color, is a means to the attainment of any artistic end. It checks the chaotic. It produces organic structures. When, however, the artist begins to play around with forms and to content himself with the achievement of balance and pro- portion, a kind of sterility sets in. A calcification of the form structure. A dis- sipation of intensity. A kind of dissolution of self. A retrogression sets in. A conscious turning backward to the past. Thus it was that primitivism, exoticism and infantilism developed within expressionism. In com- mon with the moribund cubism a leaning upon classicism. This striving to attach oneself to dead traditions is nothing other than an attempt to substitute an intellectual rapport with the past for the living tradition which has been lost. But in no sense a return to nature. Detectable in all of these en- deavors is a seeking after those enduring principles which the art of the past re- veals in nearly all of her works. But every dependence upon the past is bound to These were collages made by the Ger- man artist, Kurt Schwitters out of odds and ends of paper, cloth and other mis- cellaneous materials in combination with paint. One of the earliest of these included a newspaper fragment bearing the latter half of the German word Kommerz and Schwitters adopted this as the title of hi, Merz pictures. With Schwitters, chopping the word Kommerz in two and using half of it to designate his pictures was no ex- ceptional procedure. He once sliced a poem by Goethe vertically into two parts and called each mutilated portion a poem by himself.-Translator's note.

Only then can they become its symbol. With dadaism a wide-ranging activity entered as an invigorating influence into art. Its effect in Germany was chiefly poli- tical. In Switzerland and France it led to a further development of cubism, to pure abstract art. A phenomenon parallel- ing Russian suprematism. Suprematism exhausted the possibilities of non-objective art. The fact that a suprematist could see fit to paint a white square on a white square signifies, indeed, the end of abstraction.2 Complete destruc- tion of substance. But at the same time highest concentration. Utmost tensing of the will to achieve the ultimate unity. Suprematism breaks down the solid pic- torial elements of cubism into planes. Thus it creates consistently two-dimensional painting. It is a rhythmic play of abstract planes. Simple geometric forms. The suprematists seek the zero point of art. They carry to a conclusion the process of analytic subtraction. They await the com- ing of a new synthesis. The constructivists have resolutely pur- sued a new course. That of reality. The determination to take possession of reality is clearly perceptible in their non-utilitarian constructions. The constructivists have pro- ceeded from construction in painting to the construction of objects. To architecture in the most comprehensive sense of this term. 2 This refers to Kasimir Malevich's famous painting of 1918, White on White, now in the Museum of Modern Art.- Translator's note. Constructivism is the logical conse- quence of the cooperative working meth- ods of our time. Thus it has an objective rather than a subjective basis. It accepts without reservation the fact that art like the whole of life is rooted in society. It seeks its form elements in the manifesta- tions of our industrial age. Mathematical clarity, geometric severity, purposeful or- ganization, rigorous economy and the most exact construction are not only technical but also eminently artistic problems. They constitute, indeed, the essence of our epoch. Constructivism draws every object into the realm of art. It creates reality in- stead of illusions. The works of the constructivists, in the last analysis, are merely experiments with materials. They are working consciously toward a solution of new problems of materials and form. Their works are only a transition to utilitarian architectonic struc- tures. A well-disciplined training for architecture is their final objective. 351 Hilberseimer: Observations on the New Art</page></plain_text>
