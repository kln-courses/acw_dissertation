<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SEMIOTIC INTERPRETATION OF GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ'S NO ONE WRITES TO THE COLONEL by Donald E. Socha University of Wisconsin - La Crosse When reduced to a simple abstraction on a literal level of reading, Gabriel García Márquez's novella, No One Writes to the Colonel, pub- lished in 1961, is, in the words of the noted Latin American literary critic, Emir Rodriguez Monegal, "a Hemingwayesque story about an ex-revolutionary waiting in proud destitution for a promised government pension." 1 On this objective level, the story details the fruitless attempts weakly made by a septuagenarian and nameless colonel, the indomitable survivor of one of his country's many failed political revolutions, to eke out a meager existence during the last solitary years of his life. His lifelong companion in poverty is his practical but sickly wife, who offers a counterpoint of reason and acceptance of a humble fate to the colonel's stubborn resistence to capitulate before an oppressive reality. The circular story, covering a time span of several uneventful weeks, ends on the same note of utter despair with which it began. During this period, the couple is depicted as being pulled between two opposing poles - one represented by an unpromising reality of sickness, dire poverty and habit, or a continuation of the past -the other oriented toward a future which offers some muted hope of physical or psychological escape from that stagnant reality. Some nine months prior to the opening of the story the couple's only son, Agustín, was vilely assassinated at a local cockfight while distributing clandestine materials. As a result, the son will be mourned by family and friends for one year. Thus, in the words of the colonel's wife, "we, the parents, have become the orphans of our son" (II).2 Time in this story is at once circular, simultaneous and linear - circular in the ironically repetitious effect that chronological time plays on events in life, simultaneous in the architectonic and synchronic</page><page sequence="2">88 Donald E. Socha intermingling of past, present and future events, and linear in the narrative progression towards death beginning in October and ending in December. The couple's expectations for breaking a circle of poverty and loneli- ness are kept alive, as in the thread to life from which they cling and the active linear development of a plot, in the form of a fighting cock, which promises to bring in profits to the colonel within several weeks, if necessity can be staved off long enough to reach that future date. The rooster had belonged to Agustín, and in one sense is a métonymie displacement of the son as a symbol of hope. Far from acting as a fixed or static symbol, the rooster represents an array of metonymical substitutions involving the displacement of metaphor by goal, agent, object, instrument and cause. It is also, for example, a cause of the couple's hunger for they feed it instead of themselves, the instrument of the colonel's pride, and the goal of his waiting. While in the couple's house, tied by his leg to the stove or the bedpost, the rooster represents a domesticated capon, a metaphor of the tired colonel whose fight has left him. Later, it comes to signify individual resistence to a relentless, brutal and anarchic physical world, a symbol of denial: of the physical self, of others, of nature and of humanly constructed conventions and institutions. Another expectation, tied to the past, operates to sustain hope. The colonel's posture of confident and innocent trust in that he will soon receive a promised government pension in the mail, as compensation for his former revolutionary pursuits, corresponds to a circular or repetitive story within a story. Every Friday for 1 5 years the colonel repeats a ritual in which he greets with apprehension and fear the arrival of the town's mail boat, follows the postman on his rounds, and ends by staring at his vacant cubbyhole in the post office. This rite is the source of the story's title for, indeed, no one ever does write to the colonel. It is on this literal level of reading the text that the reader can appreciate Márquez's indictment of a constantly shifting political estab- lishment, whose central government is incapable of long-term legislation which could result in the colonel's receipt of his long overdue pension, or at least of some old age assistance. Also salient is Márquez's humorous satire of society, developed in much the same style as in his later novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and to which he alludes when he evokes the colonel's youthful revolutionary experiences (39, 42, 55, 66). In the nameless town in which this story occurs, a characteristic admixture of pious religious conservatism and popular superstition, of political paterna- lism and friendship masking clandestine activities, coexist with stereotypi- cally corrupt authority figures. The insensitive town mayor appears on his balcony dressed in long underwear, while lamenting funeral processioners pass below him. The town priest, Father Angel, is portrayed as a type of moral policeman who spies on those who enter the movies he has rated as</page><page sequence="3">A Semiotic Interpretation of García Márquez 89 unfit for viewing. To make matters even worse, the town is under martial law, and the curtailment of freedoms includes: religious ratings of public movies, government censorship of printed materials, military reconnais- sance of all group gatherings and nightly curfews. These familiar aspects of life under repressive military regimes present nothing new to readers of Latin American literature, who will recall the rigors of life and suspension of basic liberties in the indianist novels of social protest by Alcides Arguedas, Mariano Azuela and Ciro Alegría, not to mention Miguel Ángel Asturias's scathing probe of life under a political despot in El señor presidente. What does qualify No One Writes to the Colonel as meritorious of careful reading and literary analysis is the existence of carefully construct- ed patterns of interconnected images and symbols, whose meanings are enhanced as they are interpreted on two levels. First, in relation to four universal themes: old age, entrapment, time and dehumanization; second, in relation to each other. This shall be the focus of my investigation. To begin, I will examine the story's themes. The first theme, that of old age, is developed within the story by constant reference to immanent death, through dialogue which shows a morbid preoccupation with the subject. As the town doctor enters the colonel's home for a routine check, he quips "Everybody dead?" (16). The colonel's wife exclaims "When I'm well I can bring back the dead" (20). "Death is an animal with claws," says another character (36). These fragments of isolated dialogue enter into the game of unraveling meaning, although their initial effect as non-sequiturs is to disconcert the reader. They do, however, serve as clues to a poetic reality experienced within the story. Indeed, the hyperboles are realized and metaphor is literalized. Allusions to the spirits of the dead (19), ghosts (28), sickness (8, 11, 19, 47) and directly to the death of someone in the town abound throughout the story as an omnipresent force. Setting too implies significance and extends the theme of fatality. Vegetable decay and decomposition sur- round the colonel - his thatched roof leaks at the same time he feels the sweat of fever trickle down his spine; the trees are rotting; his patio wall is falling down (3, 5, 6, 15, 42). The opening scene of the story sets an ambience of natural corrosiveness, rot, fungal activity and decay which is a metaphorical amplification of significant setting related to the char- acters. Both the colonel and his wife suffer from a myriad of ailments and are continually attacked by mosquitoes, flies, lice and moths. The story begins at the onset of the rainy season and the rain is corrosive, causing both rust and dysentery. As always, the colonel feels poisonous lilies and fungus growing in his gut at the onset of the October rainy season (3). His wife is bedridden with asthma (47). The story then passes to a surreal funeral involving the entire town. Even the title of the last movie seen by</page><page sequence="4">90 Donald E. Socha the colonel's wife, entitled "The Dead Man's Will," alludes to the quasi-state and tenacity of the old man. Death has taken such firm root in the psychology of the town's inhabitants and their everyday activities that the distinction between mortality and vitality is blurred. Much as in Juan Rulfo's Pedro Páramo, the mumified living (the colonel often resembles a mummy wrapped to the ears his woolen blanket) (4, 28) are like ghosts in limbo and the dead are presented as, simultaneously, exercising an eerie hold over the world of the flesh. Agustín lives on, not only in the memories of his family and friends, but also as a presence which writes letters and animates the almost human rooster. The living are thus dehumanized and objectified. At times they are scarcely more significant than the anthropomorphic objects which surround them. Initially, the colonel's only vitality is noticed in his still youthful eyes, symbolic of his irrepressible spirit. Death's approach is also shown by the colonel's refusal to live in the present. His life is suspended between dream-like memories of the past and unrealistic hopes for the future. Time passes slowly in the last moments of the colonel's life. Indeed, as noted by the doctor, the couple's clock "keeps time with the buzzards" (16). Constant references to the time of day, a past month, year or date do little to help the reader focus on a changing sequence of events, but rather serve a thematic purpose seen in other works by Márquez, according to a study by Germán Darío Carrillo in his book La narrativa de Gabriel García Márquez. Accordingly, the slowness of time, references to the weather, the time of day and to minute detail, such as how the colonel dresses himself, his habits and the nature of his reactions, emphasize the stoppage of linear time, when life appears useless and lacking in real goals. The theme of time's betrayal over the individual is quite literally connected to that of old age and death, which in turn represents a dehumanized existence. All the colonel's comrads have died (24, 60). The colonel functionally approaches the level of existence of caged animal life and the physical immobility of the vegetable realm, as do others who live in the town. Normal or natural hierarchies of life leading up from the elemental to the angelical realms are inverted or truncated. The town and its inhabitants are trapped in a non-redeeming limbo. The colonel's wife is so thin and sinewy she seems to have the power of walking through the walls. The colonel often feels as if his body were superfluous (33). Symbols which portray the theme of entrapment, which we have already discussed on a socio-political scale, abound in the story. The colonel's net-like hammock, where he fitfully rests in a dream-like vigil punctuated by fevers, nausea and vivid memories, and his wife's mosquito netting, which envelopes her bed, become objective correlatives of entrap- ment and isolation. Such a view of two ordinary objects is sustained by the</page><page sequence="5">A Semiotic Interpretation of García Márquez 9 1 use to which the objects are put and by the inordinate repetition made of them by the author. The nets become yet other symbols of the characters' desperate situations. This grid-like pattern of the net amplifies to include other objets which repeat the visual image of interwoven threads of criss-crossed lines. For example, the symmetrically arranged cages of animals arriving on the riverboat for a circus (54), the pattern of the post office boxes watched intently by the colonel (12), the baroque painting of a Virgin covered in tulle (4), a stiff netting, the wrought iron window gratings on Sabas's new house (10) and the wooden grille at the entry to the couple's patio (25) all represent a kind of sequestered entrapment in the story. At one point in the narration, the colonel becomes little more humanly substantial than a wet piece of woven fabric stretched between two hooks in the tailor shop where his son once worked (32). This image corresponds to the image of the colonel stretched out in his hammock. It also neatly summarizes his bipolar dichotomy - stretched between hope and futility -and the constant comparison of the colonel to the objects which surround him as signs to his nature. The picture of the Virgin behind nylon netting with roses and cupids which hangs in the colonel's house is an idealized extension of the image of his wife behind the mosquito netting. She too wants to plant roses, but the pigs always eat them. Both the colonel and his wife are dehumanized by their entrapment. He is reduced to the category of an object; she to an image without substance, like the picture on the wall. Neither one of them feels that they really know each other, despite over forty years of marriage (41). As is becoming evident, the four major themes overlap through many connected semantic and imaginary threads, under the leit-motif of es- trangement. Time is related to entrapment through the continual vigil for a letter which will never arrive and through the reliving of the past through memory and dreams. Dehumanization, in turn, correlates to old age, time and entrapment through the equation of people to objects, the slowness of the passage of time, and the inability to live comfortably in the present. Correspondences among these themes become richer and more elaborate as the individual reader restructures and hypothesizes about the purposes and significance of dialogue, images, symbols, references and characterizations. The major themes delineated above are equivalent to what Umberto Eco terms generalizing or particularizing synecdoches in his article "The Scandal of Metaphor." Our next task herein is to establish what he terms a "polydimensional network of properties which connect the various images and symbols of the story" (243). This procedure will entail the use of intermediary terms which will permit disambiguation within the hermen- eutical and contextual circle of the text. Simply stated, some properties of objects serve as the interprétants of other objects. In relation to what</page><page sequence="6">92 Donald E. Socha has been discussed, the net can be viewed as an intermediary term connecting the various images and symbols of entrapment. An example or two should suffice as a means of introduction to our isotopy, or path of investigation, and to the complexity of the correspon- dences involved in a semiotic inquiry. As the story unfolds, the colonel is preparing to leave home one rainy afternoon in order to attend the aforementioned funeral of the town trumpet player, the first natural death in years in that area. His wife searches a memento-filled trunk for an umbrella. She locates one at the bottom of the chest, wrapped in old newspaper and covered with moth- balls. As learned much later in the story, the umbrella is associated with past memories, having been won in a raffle during a circus celebrating a political election many years prior when the couple's son was a mere boy. The newspaper wrapping is significant, for within the context of the story it represents both chronological time and censorship. News is little more than obituaries and advertisements. The mothballs signal the omnipre- sence of circular objects representing recurrence and habit. As the colon- el's wife unwraps the umbrella it is discovered that, much like them, only the rigid frame of metal wires remains. Rot has destroyed the satiny cover, as it has taken in like manner its toll on the couple. On several occasions the pair is described in terms of their metallic skeletal frames. The colonel's wife is of the same material as her stove (53). The colonel's bones are articulated as if with nuts and bolts (25). He has a cast iron stomach (35). Referring to the couple's ravaged bodies, the colonel's wife declares "we're all rotting alive" (6). Thus, old age, decomposition, memories and dehumanization are intertwined under the image of the umbrella, which relates a happier past to a dismal present. Death is also associated with the umbrella by the slightly addled wife of Sabas, a self-serving political traitor, who admits to the colonel, again, later in the story in yet another seeming non-sequitur, that "umbrellas have something to do with death" (36). By means of a process of sense and reference, of hypothesis, induction and deduction, the meaning of the "umbrella image" is related to disassociated events, to the characters' situations, to bizarre descriptions and ultimately to meaning. The umbrella is also connected to the theme of entrapment, in two senses. The first manner is through the association of morphological properties, in the maner in which the net metaphor was deciphered. The colonel has recurrent nightmares, accompanied by fevers. He explains his sickness to his wife by recounting his dream of the spider web (15, 43), an unequivocable metaphor for fatal entrapment in a net. The frame of the rotted umbrella and the spider web are associated imaginatively through their structures. In turn, the net-like structure of the web relates the</page><page sequence="7">A Semiotic Interpretation of García Márquez 93 umbrella to the images of the net previously discussed, which, in turn, are associated with the other themes of the story. In yet another sense, the umbrella is connected with entrapment and death. During the funeral, it is Sabas who shields the colonel with his own umbrella. Sabas is quite literally the town spider, associated with hypoder- mic needles, who stung his political partners to death to save his own skin and become wealthy. The colonel struggles with his own pride whenever forced by necessity to seek a favor of Sabas. Indeed, it is Sabas who waits for hunger to cause the colonel to sell him his fighting cock so that he can reap the profits from this undoubted champion of the cockpits. The colonel feels trapped by Sabas's influence. His office, appropriate to his Satanic and venomous characterization, is described as an inferno (43). Thus, from the intermediary term of "umbrella" as entrapment, we pass to Sabas as an agent of death, to the rooster, as a symbol of resistence to the tyranny of political repression. The entire story can be reconstructed based on such associations. The circus is also related to all the events, symbols and characters described thus far. Sabas originally arrived in the town with the circus as a snake charmer, boasting one of his pets coiled around his neck. Caged animals have been connected to the net image and, interestingly, the colonel's decomposed umbrella was won during that same circus which brought Sabas to the town. The circus is once again arriving in town as the story concludes. Curiously, the colonel sees another snake charmer, described exactly like Sabas. We are reminded of the etymology of circus, derived from the latin for circle, and of the theme of circular repetitive time, as well as simultaneous time, making present, past and future indistinguishable. We have already seen the circus associated with mem- ories, through the "umbrella image", and with entrapment, through the images of caged animals, indicative of the condition of the town's dehuman- ized inhabitants. T ruly, Márquez has developed a highly unified network of correspondences within this work of art. It would require more elabora- tion to reconstruct the entire network of properties and correspondences sketched out here. Several of the symbols and images which can be ascribed to each theme or generalizing synecdoche might be an interesting way to conclude this preliminary investigation. Further insights into his intricately and masterfully woven web, where no element in the story appears superfluous or in semantic isolation, await the discovery of each new reader. The theme of old age is repeatedly connected with death, sickness, solitude, decomposition and inactivity, as we have shown. Its semantic field is metaphorically expanded outward from the colonel to include the entire town and all those marginal beings entrapped within who live under martial law, that is to say, all who are politically disenfranchised, reli-</page><page sequence="8">94 Donald E. Socha giously repressed and socially isolated, which in some respect includes everyone. The town itself is described as "paralyzed, sunken and in a stupor" (45, 56) by its "motionless river of steel" (45). The townspeople neither sing nor play music, for they are all in perpetual mourning. Recurrence in time dominates the town's social life, visited by travelling salesmen and those who leave only to return shortly thereafter. The circularity of life is imaged in the circular arena of the cockpit (55) and in the roulette wheel (50), both of which are subjected to scrutiny by local authorities and are connected to activities suspected of creating political unrest. Marquez goes to great lengths to unite the theme of circular time with images of circularity and of endless repetition. One image of this type is the pendulum clock which the couple cannot sell and which, much like the symbol of the umbrella, unites the story's themes and images. When the clock ceases to function, toward the middle of the story, it is wrapped in newspaper in order to be transported by the colonel to be fixed, who suggests that toting it through town would be like walking around with the Holy Sepulcher. The ancient clock, with its pendulum movement, is yet another metaphor for the human yet untouchable colonel, who swings back and forth like a pendulum, between the past and the future, but whose movement is inscribed in habitual circles like the dial. Images of circularity abound in this work: we see them in the children gathered around what the colonel's wife terms the "evil-omened rooster," (55) in the circus performer with a snake coiled around his neck selling medicines without a license (55), and in the whirling blades of the electric fans in Sabas's office and in the pool hall (35). The colonel refers to some round pills he totes as like carrying death in his pocket (36). Inscription within the circle is inextricably associated with death and isolation in all the many connotations of these words. At the close of the story, distraught by the colonel's refusal to face reality and by life's unfulfilled promises, the colonel's wife utters "it's the same old story as always" (60). Like the expectation of a pension, the rooster also proves to be another circular ritual. The colonel refuses to sell the animal to Sabas and withdrew him from the trial fights which he was winning. He plans on waiting for a big event later next month. From this point on, Marquez concludes the linear development of the plot by emphasizing recurrence in staccatto-like succession (60-62). The words lose and minute are repeated in conjunction with a mirroring-effect achieved through paired and multiplied numbers echoing the concept of a "Catch 22". In his hammock, semi-conscious, on death's threshold, the colonel falls to the bottom of a substance without time and space (61), a situation which structurally and semantically mirrors the beginning of the story, where he felt as though he were revolving in concentric circles, floating through jelly (14). Alone, unchanged, starving and tormented by</page><page sequence="9">A Semiotic Interpretation of Garcia Marquez 95 the memories of Neerlandia (42) - the never-never land of his youthful revolutionary hopes -the colonel will persist in the expensive illusion provided by his only hope for the future -the rooster's chances in the circular pit - scheduled for next month. He has himself become the intangible substance of metaphor, the projection of an image of the past and the fantasy of an unfulfilled future, yet, in this uncompromising stance he somehow feels pure, invincible and explicit (62).
