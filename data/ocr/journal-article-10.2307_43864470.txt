<plain_text><page sequence="1">4 Arthur Schnitzler's Literary and Philosophical Development Robert O. Weiss While it is the hope of those who sincerely appreciate the work of Arthur Schnitzler that the considerable, most grati- fying interest in this author during 1962, the centennial year of his birth, will not only continue but increase in the future, the possibility cannot be dismissed that not all of the recent enthusiasm is based entirely on scholarly or artistic consid- erations and may consequently diminish after the close of the centennial year. Furthermore, like the initial phase of any trend-reversing movement, the present Schnitzler-Ren- aissance - if such it is - has been inspired and sustained by the efforts of relatively few individuals, and there is as yet little valid evidence to indicate a fundamental change of attitude toward Schnitzler on the part of many literary hist- orians and Germanisten. It seems useful, therefore, to recall briefly some of the most commonly advanced criticism of Schnitzler and, by outlining his growth as Dichter und Denker, to expose the key fallacy largely responsible for the persistent misjudg- ment of his writings. Thus it is not the purpose of this article to submit the results of a new, original investigation, but rather to present already known, or at least easily verifiable information in such a manner as to show Arthur Schnitzler as a continuously growing author, thereby refuting the wide- spread assumption to the contrary. Even today it remains a crucial fact that prior to 1962 scant attention was paid to Schnitzler in the literature. * This indifference is hardly surprising because - with rare meritorious exceptions - he has been described in terms of disparaging and inaccurate stereotypes . Most of the stand- ard works on German literature still present him as the</page><page sequence="2">5 exponent of Viennese Decadence and his philosophy as re- stricted to moral relativism. He is regarded as an arch- impressionist and the poet of Austria's tired young Epi- cureans. His writings are considered mildly entertain- ing, but shallow. For too many years these opinions have been repeated uncritically in the seminars and classrooms, and therefore one can hardly blame the students of German literature for not investigating Schnitzler any further after having read, dutifully but already in a negative frame of mind, a few of his works on the required reading list. Incidentally, over 150 of Schnitzler's writings have been published, yet it seems that those selected for re- quired reading are usually chosen from the author's ear- liest and least mature productions. Consequently, Schnitz- ler's name frequently evokes nothing but the memory re- sponses of such works as Anatol2 and Liebelei, ^ besides, of course, of a work that was not written for publication at all, namely Reigen. ^ His infinitely more important writings, on the other hand, such as his essays Über Krieg und Frieden, 5 or the penetrating philosophical study, Per Geist im Wort und der Geist in der Tat, 6 or his Buch der Sprüche und Bedenken, ? to name only a few, are relegated to perpetual obscurity. There are, certainly, several factors that have caused the unfortunate underrating and misjudgment of Arthur Schnitzler. It seems, however, that the most serious er- ror has been the tacit assumption that his literary and intellectual development was arrested at the level of his early publications. To be sure, it would have been quite easy, lucrative, and pleasant to continue giving to audiences and readers what they obviously wanted, as shown by the enthusiastic reception of Anatol and Liebelei: some light- hearted gaiety, a little melancholy, a lot of sparkling and witty dialogue in a slightly risque setting, and not too much depth - a prescription which Schnitzler could have filled very easily for the rest of his life. Only he would not have beëh AiiïhUriSchnifziër had he adjusted his work to the</page><page sequence="3">6 demands for merely good entertainment. Thus he did not fol- low the tempting career of a manufacturer of best sellers but rapidly outgrew the stage of süsse Mädel and leichtsin- nige Melancholiker, even though he continued using such figures as literary devices. Neither praise nor adverse com ments could detract him from the path that his artistic evol- tion, his personal honesty, and his social conscience delineated A lesser man would have taken warning from the ominous reactions in powerful circles that followed the publication of Freiwild in 1896, 8 a play with a strong message against the practice of duelling and a bitter reproach against some aspects of the code of honor among the officer caste. Un- doubtedly he was well aware of the furor he would unleash against himself if he were to persist in his criticism of such sacrosanct follies, but Schnitzler remained true to himself. Four years later he published Leutnant Gusti, 9 a novelette in interior monologue form, attacking the myth that every army officer is automatically a gentleman by virtue of his commission. Now the storm broke in earnest. Leutnant Gusti had ap- peared in Neue Freie Presse on December 25, 1900, and almost over night the author became persona non grata. One of the results was the revocation of his reserve com- mission as Oberarzt by the military authorities. Subsequ- ently the flood gates of chauvinism and anti-Semitism opened wide, and Schnitzler was deluged with abuse. No invective seemed too strong, no vituperative slander too low to be flung at him, Eventually the commotion sub- sided, but in certain circles that included quite a few Germanisten the name Schnitzler had permanently become anathema. Leutnant Gusti was not a singular phenomenon in the author's literary work, even if one considers Freiwild and Spiel im Morgengrauen 1 1 as. ej ust another facet ofthe same problem. The play Das Vermächtnis ^ (1897) carries just as strong a social message. It is a very eloquent con-</page><page sequence="4">7 demnation of certain elements in Schnitzler's own social stratum, the upper middle classes. Schnitzler, a man who hated hypocrisy, created here a veritable rogues' gallery of hypocrites . This drama also tends to invalidate a fre- quently raised accusation against its author, namely that he is incapable of arousing strong emotions . The unbiased reader of Das Vermächtnis wtM feel as much aversion to- ward the sanctimonious and heartless Professor Losatti in Das Vermächtnis as he is capable of mustering with re- spect to any figure created by any author. The sadistic physician in the same work evokes a similar reaction. The even more frequently advanced argument that Arthur Schnitzler was not interested in anything outside the range of love and death is to be rejected as well. Clearly he dem- onstrates a very strong concern with social injustice in the dramas Freiwild, Das Vermächtnis, and Professor Bernhardi, 13 and in his novel Der Weg ins Freie. 14 These last two works concern themselves also with the way public opinion is manipulated in the interest of in- dividual politicians and pressure groups, in addition to other social questions. Indeed, it may be stated that the social problems constitute Schnitzler's second thematic group if one counts the Anatol-type works as the first. In another thematic group the author presents preter- natural and parapsychological phenomena. This field is more circumscribed in time than any of the others. Most of this work was accomplished in the period from 1900 to 1909 and consists chiefly of Die Frau mit dem Dolche, Das Schicksal des Freiherrn von Leisenbohg, 16 Die Weissagung, 17 and Das Tagebuch der Redegonda. i8 These works are not the only ones containing problems of the preternatural but merely those in which such questions constitute the central theme. In all of them, however, the author, for whom the mysterious nature of reality al- ways had a strange fascination, carefully leaves open the possibility that the phenomena in question could have been due to chance or natural causes, after all.</page><page sequence="5">8 A great many other topics can be discerned in Sch- nitzler 's writings, among them the ever recurring ones of the essential loneliness of the individual, man's in- ability really to understand or possess completely an- other human being, the nature of jealousy, the lure of life, existential anguish, and the psychology of death. 19 Through the microscope of psychology Schnitzler ob- serves human behavior and emotions in their multiple manifestations, and he faithfully reports to his readers what he has found. His characters range from princes to beggars, and from truly noble persons to veritable dev- ils in human form. To accuse Schnitzler } then, of having a narrow horizon and a small selection of themes, mani- festly constitutes an injustice and unscholarly bias. Fred- erick J, Behariell has compiled a representative listing of such criticism in his article "Arthur Schnitzleťs Range of Theme"2° showing that few authors can compare with Schnitzler in respect to versatility and thematic scope. It is therefore superfluous to elaborate on this point. An observation by Victor A. Oswald, Jr. serves very well as a summation of this aspect of Schnitzler criticism: "It is time for us to stop thinking of Schnitzler as the poet of 'love and death, ' as the 'arch-impression- ist, ' and rather to take exact account of what he him- self felt was the basic characteristic of his compie^ make-up» His own name for himself was - Naturforscher. "21 Following this advice of Oswald's, a detailed study of the psychotic figures appearing in Schnitzler's works was conducted. 22 There are over thirty of such characters, and they are so accurately described that many of them could be used as illustrative material for advanced con- cepts of modern psychiatric theory. The author's most scientific story, Flucht in die Finsternis, 23 js a case in point. Upon reading the novelette for the first time, few people would discern at once the wealth of psychiatric mat- erial contained in it. One would know, to be sure, that the story deals with a man who is gradually losing his mind,</page><page sequence="6">9 but one would not realize that a detailed and complete clinical history can be constructed from the informa- tion available in the book. The same principle applies to other works by Schnitz- ler describing psychotics. There, too, a surprising amount of clinical data was extracted from writings which, for the most part, captivate the reader solely through the development of the plot, the admirable style, and the pleasing form. It is only reasonable to assume that Schnitzler did not undertake the painstaking labor of including so many clinical minutiae just to impress an occasional reader who is able to appreciate them. They represent, rather, evidence that the author's essential perfection- ism would brook no inaccuracy. It appears obvious, then, that the development of Schnitzler 's topical range greatly exceeds the limited scope of his early writings, and the same holds true for the development of his style. The usual classification of Schnitzler as an out-and- out impressionist is a serious error. While many of his better known works are indeed written in the impression- istic manner, this is not at all the only literary school demonstrable in his writings. It seems that the deplorable tendency on the part of some literary historians to classify first and then to ignore the factors which do not fit the classification has been operative here. In Das Vermächtnis and Freiwild, for example, the obvious theses of social reproach place these works in the realm of fighting natural- ism in spite of the temperate style, and if one did not know that Therese^ was written by Schnitzler, he would have to classify the book as a late-naturalistic society novel, since it has all the necessary characteristics. Also, it is diffi- cult to consider the novelette Spiel im Morgengrauen as anything but naturalistic. In this work Schnitzler uses</page><page sequence="7">10 even the description of unpleasantly realistic details, cert- ainly a naturalistic technique. One need only look at the end of the story where the body of the suicide is pictured: "Der Leutnant Willi Kasda, im Mantel mit hochgestelltem Kragen, lehnte in der dem Fenster zugewandten Ecke des schwarzen Lederdivans, die Lider halb geschlossen, den Kopf auf die Brust gesunken, schlaff hing der rechte Arm über die Lehne, der Revolver lag auf dem Fussboden, von der Schlafe Uber die Wange sickerte ein schmaler Streifen dunkelroten Bluts, der sich zwischen Hals und Kragen ver- lor. " Instances of expressionism also present themselves in Schnitzler's writings. In the puppet play Zum grossen Wurstl^S one finds the typically expressionistic figures without names or individual personalities. There are der Heitere, der Bissige, der Unbekannte, der Wohlwollende, der Räsoneur, der Naive and others - all symbolic charac- ters, generic types representing classes and ideas instead of persons . Romanticism is not missing from the author's work either. As a matter of fact, he repeatedly utilized the romantic medium of the Märchen when he wished to ex- press philosophical ideas without relating them to any particular point in time or a specific stratum of society. Thus we find the ideological cores of the short stories Die drei Elixiere,26 Legende, 27Geschichte eines Genies,288 Die dreifache Warnung,29 and Die Hirtenflöte30 shrouded in the language and atmosphere of the fairy tale. The long- ing for and the pursuit of the unattainable, demanded by the Romanticists, is also very clearly contained in these stories . With the exception of Geschichte eines Genies, they all picture man's quest for understanding the incompre- hensible or his tragic attempts to provide himself with powers that are not for him to possess. The mystic ele- ment, an important ingredient of the romantic literature, is present not only in these novelettes, but also in the author's works dealing with supernatural phenomena. Rom-</page><page sequence="8">11 antic irony is demonstrable in Zum grossen Wurstl, in spite of its expressionistic setting. Here the poet rises above his own work and thoroughly satirizes it as well as himself. 31 For an instance of Weltschmerz, another attribute of romanticism, it may suffice to point to the motivation for suicide of the poet Filippo Loschi in Schnitzler's five-act Renaissance drama Der Schleier der Beatrice. 32 Just as Schnitzler's keen scientific mind and his great artistic talent created a rare and most fortunate combin- ation of a physician and an author, his stylistic evolution culminated in a surprisingly smooth and pleasing synthesis which reduces its classification into any one of its compon- ent literary movements to the status of a half-truth at best. Upon examination of Schnitzler's philosophical develop- ment it becomes obvious that he was compulsive on the subject of truth. Its ephemeral properties and its relation to falsehood fascinated him. In Dié grosse Szene 3 3 the actor Konrad Herbot deceives Edgar Gley, by means of truth, as to his relationship with Gley's betrothed, Efeisy. Everything Herbot says to Gley is objectively true, but the things he leaves unspoken turn his words into lies . The letter from Daisy which he offers in evidence is gen- uine, but it is an instrument of falsehood because it was written earlier than Gley assumes, before Daisy had be- come Herbot's mistress. There are many other instances demonstrative of the relativity of truth to be found in Schnitzler's works, and it is possible that his pronounced skepticism may have been a direct result of his truth fixation. For the same reason, however, he eventually became distrustful of his own skepticism and gradually arrived at the realization that truth on its most profound level must be anchored to absolute ethical values and personal responsibility. Josef Körner clearly describes the shift from the author's early moral relativism to his stern rejection of these tenets in his old age. 34 The transition was gradual; there were no sudden, startling</page><page sequence="9">12 changes, and this may be the reason why it is not general- ly reflected in the discussions of Schnitzler's work in the histories of literature. Körner is of the opinion that the transformation was completed by 1912, having begun in 1903 with Der einsame Weg. There may be yet another reason why no difference in Arthur Schnitzler's Welt- anschauung was noted: he did not alter his characters mat- erially. They did not suddenly become moral giants but remained outwardly what they had been before. The change was profound but subtle. Formerly the central characters, such as Anatol, incurred only superficial adversities, for the most part, as a result of their amoral philosophy and behavior, while the author seemed to smile upon them tol- erantly. Later, similar figures suffer catastrophic inner consequences, while their creator appears to contemplate them sadly, pointing out that "this is not the key to life nor the way to happiness. One need only think of Erasmus and Dionysia in Die Hirtenflöte (1911) to remove any doubt as to the validity of Körner 's contention. This, briefly, is the essence of the story: Erasmus has intellectualized himself into the extremes of amoral philosophy, to the point of forcing his wife Dion- ysia to leave their home in order to realize all her potent- ialities to the utmost. The woman complies, racing from one adventure to another, experiencing greatest exultation and deepest despair, the peaks and abysses in human re- lations; but when she returns from her fantastic excursions to the man who had sent her away and who had absolved her in advance, she cannot bear to stay with him. His amoral- ity is so strongly developed that he does not even ask ques- tions and is genuinely uninterested in the details of Dionysia 's Odyssey. Instead, satisfied that she has complied with his request, he intends to take up where they had left off, as if nothing had happened . Dionysia, however, is now unable to live with Erasmus who has a naturalistic slogan in the place of a soul. She would have welcomed recriminations, jealousy, even punishment, but she cannot accept the monstrous hybris of jenseits von Gut und Böse. These are</page><page sequence="10">13 her parting words to Erasmus: "Ja wärst du erschaudert vor dem Hauch der tausend Schicksale, der um meine Stirne fliesst, so hätt' ich bleiben dürfen, und unsere Seelen wären vielleicht ineinandergeschmolzen in der Glut namenloser Schmerzen. So aber, tiefer als vor allen Masken und Wundern der Welt, graut mich vor der steinernen Fratze deiner Weisheit. "35 The message is clear: the tenets of moral relativism are wrong, and their consistent application is self- defeating. A related idea is expressed in Der letzte Brief eines Literaten (1917). ^ The unnamed central figure, a most egocentric writer, elopes with his fiancee, although he has been told by her physician that she is seriously ill and cannot survive the demands of marriage. In his gigan- tic conceit the young man justifies his irresponsible step not with his love for the girl, but with his intention to collect emotional material for his great literary work from the anxieties to be expected and even, or especially, from the pain he expects to experience at Maria's prob- able death. His awakening moral conscience, however, drives the man to realize the futility of his behavior and , consequently, the enormity of his guilt. He cannot undo the harm he has wrought - Maria is already dying - butlhe cm andcctoes permit his love for her to emerge fully, free from any pose, beautifying the girl's last days on earth. Since it has now become impossible for him to survive his victim, he kills himself as she draws her last breath. Again, this is not a story written by a moral relativist. The same applies to Casanovas Heimfahrt (1918). ^ To be sure, the old adventurer in this tale feels no pangs of conscience. As a matter of fact, he performs prodi- gious feats of immorality and depravity, but his reward is terrible. He loses everything he values most, and in the end he presents a loathsome picture, even to him- self, as he returns to his home town: old, repulsive,</page><page sequence="11">14 impoverished, dishonored, and utterly lonely. Fortunately, direct evidence is available regarding the question of Schnitzler's eventual attitude toward Free Will. The following excerpt from G.S. Viereck's interview with the author needs no elaboration: "'Do you accept the tenets of the Behaviorists who deny complete- ly the freedom of the will? ' 'No, ' Schnitzler answered. 'I am turning away more and more from my earlier mech- anistic conceptions. I believe in Free Will. Man is res- ponsible for his actions . . . Man is the master of his soul, even if his freedom of choice be limited by circum- stances and hampered by heredity . . . "'38 Perhaps the clearest indication of Schnitzler's break with absolute determinism may be found in his Buch der Sprüche und Bedenken, where he states categorically: " Nein, so leicht hat Er es sich nicht gemacht: Er hat sich einen ebenbürtigen Gegner ins All gesetzt, den frei- en Willen, der in jedem Augenblick bereit ist, mit der Kausalität den Kampf aufzunehmen und es sogar dann zu tüp, wenn er selber glaubt, sich einem unerfor schlichen Ratschluss in Demut zu unterwerfen. No doubt exists, however, that Schnitzler Is. acceptance of Free Will and individual responsibility represents a relatively late stage in his intellectual development. A comprehensive treatment of his previous determinism and moral relativism is presented in Selma Koehler's article "The Question of Moral Responsibility in the Dramatic Works of Arthur Schnitzler. "40 When touching upon the philosophic convictions of any person, the question of religion inevitably suggests itself. In the case of Schnitzler, Frida Ilmer has done a careful analysis of this problem. Speaking of Legende and Die dreifache Warnung she writes: " Here Schnitzler raises the question as to the nature of God. Both stories grant the existence of some power superior to human will</page><page sequence="12">15 and not explainable by the laws of cause and effect as we know them in the material world, a power which deter- mines our fates, inaaccordance with reasons that we cannot grasp. Miss Ilmer adduces further proof for Schnitzler's acceptance of the God-idea through pertinent excerpts from Zum grossen Wurstl, as well as from other sources, and she arrives at this well-documented but guarded con- clusion: "Instead of skepticism, we find in Schnitzler's utterances a reverent attitude which is so strong that it causes him to view the universe itself and all life in it as the greatest conceivable miracle. "42 On the strength of the literature and the author's own writings it may be stated that he never became religious in the orthodox sense, but that he found his way to recog- nition of Free Will, moral responsibility and the existence of a supreme power. With almost equal certainty one may add that his God concept was not anthropomorphic, but entirely abstract. Beyond that one should not go unless more evidence is discovered. As Arthur Schnitzler approached the peak of his intel- lectual maturation and artistic creativity, his world was racing toward its death. The agony started in 1914, and when it was over, an irreplaceable part of western civil- ization lay dead with its defenders on both sides. With them, a part of Schnitzler had gone forever. It is significant that Schnitzler never published any- thing that touched upon the great cataclysm. For him, the subject of the World War, which attracted multi- tudes of writers, was taboo. He would' not probe in the wound that burned in his soul as long as he lived. Priv- ately he did make notes on his thoughts and feelings during the period from 1915 to 1919. These appeared eight years after his death under the title Ober Krieg und Frieden, 43 but some of them had been published</page><page sequence="13">16 previously (1932) in Die neue Deutsche Rundschau. 44 They represent a touching but hopeless attempt of a rational, civilized Kulturmensch to argue agaist the savage insan- ity of war. In vain he asks, for example, why people will say "er ist einen ischönen Heldentod gestorben, " but never "er hat eine herrliche Verkrüpplung erlitten. "45 The same pages contain a very serious statement, a profound truth that no age, no nation may ignore with- out disastrous consequences: "Gewisse Epochen lassen ihre ganze Grauenhaftigkeit darin erkennen, dass inner- halb ihrer zum grössten Unrecht werden kann, was sonst das erste Gebot aller Sittlichkeit scheint, nämlich: die Wahrheit auszusprechen. - Epochen, in denen die Wahr- heit nicht nur gefährlich werden kann flir diejenigen, die sie aussprechen sondern auch für diejenigen, die sie hören, sind im Innersten ungesund. "46 It appears that Schnitzler refused to recognize the ugly post-war realities in his subsequent writings, in spite of, or perhaps because of his great empathie ability. Never- theless he continued his literary work, and his ripest, finest products stem from this autumn period of his life. The characters and their environment, however, are taken without exception from the pre-war era. This fact as well as Schnitzler's increasing reticence and self-im- posed loneliness seem to indicate that he made a with- drawal -type adjustment to the self-styled brave new world which may not have impressed him as being so brave. He could not tear out by the roots - his heart, his spirit and intellect , his concepts of beauty and truth - all deeply anchored in the past - in order to transplant himself into an epoch in which he may have discerned already the seeds of an even more frightful holocaust. Thus Schnitzler turned back to his own time and continued to write his fine , sensi- tive literature, filled with tender beauty and much wisdom, and a great deal of disconsolate sadness. On October 21, 1931, Dr. Arthur Schnitzler died. When</page><page sequence="14">17 the time comes in which art will no longer be judged by the twisted yardstick of prejudice but by its intrinsic value only, Arthur Schnitzler will truly come into his own, for his work is timeless. The problems about which he wrote will still fascinate people in the remote future, and they will reach for Schnitz ler's books eagerly and gratefully.
