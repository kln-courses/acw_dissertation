<plain_text><page sequence="1">Louise Bourgeois: The Early Work. By Josef Helfen stein. 156 pp. incl. num. col. pis. + b. &amp; w. ills. (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in association with University of Washington Press, Seatde and London, 2002), ?26.95. ISBN 0-295? 98248-9. This is the catalogue of a 2002?03 US touring exhibition, organised by the Krannert Art Museum, Urbana-Champaign, tracing Bourgeois's career from the late 1930s, when she left Europe for America, to the mid-1950s, when she began to break away from Abstract Expressionism. As well as some twenty of her first sculptures (some never before shown in pub He), the exhibition included examples from her brief, highly charged exploration of painting and a selec tion of drawings of subjects ranging from the land scapes of her childhood and anthropomorphic houses to alienating machines and high-rise buildings. Also included was her suite of engravings He disappeared into complete silence (1947), in which she reflects in word and image the experience of moving to Amer ica. Helfenstein's essay documents the making of Bourgeois's Personages, the series of wooden standing figures (later cast in bronze) that occupied her throughout this period. There is a full chronology, a selective exhibition history and bibliography.</page></plain_text>
