Mendelsohn Prince Georges General Hospital John D. States Rochester General Hospital Univ. of Rochester School of Medicine J. W. Melvin Highway Safety Research Institute Injuries to the vertebrae, vertebral ligaments para-spinal musculature, or spinal cord have been documented in both medical and engineering liter- ature, including published proceedings and texts on spine injuries. It is generally recognized that fractures or fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine are produced by impact to the head which causes excessive bending and/or rotation, or distraction, of the bony elements of the cervical spine. Cervical injuries may also occur if the head is stabilized and the lower torso or but- tocks are accelerated cranially. Infrequently, direct impact to the posterior cervical area may produce localized osseous injuries. (See Refer- ences 65 and 76.**) Case reports of cervical spine injuries with- out head impact are few, and individual cases have been hidden in articles not directly addressed to such "non-head impact" type of cervical spine ♦Reprinted from The Journal of Trauma with permission from The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.

When a mechanism for a fracture or fracture- dislocation in the cervical spine is sought, the assumption is usually made that there has been loading of the head. However, this may not be the case. Neck injuries without head impact, in other than rear-end vehicle collisions, have been re- ported. The present report summarizes clinical reports, experimental studies, and previously un- published experimental and clinical crash data on cervical spine injuries produced without impact to the head. LITERATURE REVIEW Cervical spine injuries, especially fractures and/or dislocations, are caused by hyperflexion, hyperextension, compression, shear, twisting forces, lateral bending, or a combination of these factors. These mechanisms have been associated with direct impact to the head, face, or neck, and such in- juries have occurred during sports activities, from falls, or industrial accidents in which there is impact to the head or face (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19, 39, 42-44, 56, 66, 68, 83). In automobile crashes the head may strike some interior car ABSTRACT Because of its flexibility and structure, the cervical spine is disposed to various mechanisms of injury: although not so common as injuries caused by head impacts, cervical fractures and/or fracture-dislocations have been reported without direct impact to the head. Some cervical injuries reported have been sustained by wearers of lap and shoulder belts in auto accidents; however, we do not consider belt use a potential hazard because ample evidence has accrued in the medical and engineering literature to document general injury and fatality reduction by use of seatbelts. We believe that in many instances occupants would be more seriously injured or killed were belts not worn. The present paper reviews reports of cervical injuries without head impact found in the litera- ture and case histories of such injuries from the Highway Safety Research Institute of The Univer- sity of Michigan, as well as experimental studies in animals, cadavers, and volunteer subjects. 469 0096-7 36X/80/880 1 -0469$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">470 D. F. HUELKE, ET AL. structure, or if the occupant is ejected, head- to- ground impacts also can cause neck fractures. Variations in site of impact to the head or face and in the direction of force applied produce dif- ferent types of neck fractures or fracture-dis- locations (6, 15, 50, 57, 62, 67, 79). Because the head can rotate on the spine in many directions, clinicians have frequently con- ceived the mechanisms of injury to be head impact and not torso impact which accelerates the torso from beneath the head/neck complex to produce dynamic hyperflexion or hyperextension and possible cervical spine injury without head impact. However it is known that cervical injuries can be sustained without head impact, as in the rearend automobile collision where sudden forward acceleration of the struck car also accelerates the body of the occu- pant, causing a rearward displacement of the head relative to the torso (70, 71). It is hyperex- tension and stretching of the cervical structures beyond their functional capacity that causes injury in such instances (60). Sometimes hyperflexion follows, which can cause additional cervical in- juries (21, 23, 25, 40). Although these are us- ually of the cervical ligaments or muscles, fra- ctures or fracture-dislocations have been reported. Similarly, angular head rotation without head/ face contact has been reported to produce headaches, cerebral injuries, and hematomas (10, 31, 51-53). In rearend collisions, hyperextension and/or hyperflexion injuries of the cervical spine are common and usually are not life threatening. How- ever, Garrett and Morris (23) reported three cases of "dangerous" neck injuries to drivers in cars without headrests in rearend crashes. Backstrom (4) reported a 19-year old female passenger who was wearing only a diagonal shoulder belt in a rearend collision; she sustained a fracture of the dens and no head trauma was reported. Back- strom also cited a car occupant with a C7 fracture with a T1 transverse process fracture following a rearend collision. In this case, restraint usage was not indicated. All of these patients sus- tained their neck injuries without striking their heads. Gershon-Cohen et al. (24) reported 14 auto- motive crash induced spinous process fractures in the cervi co- thoracic area caused by sudden hyper- flexion or hyperextension mechanisms. These authors were able to reproduce such fractures experimentally using cadavers. Not infrequently, neck fractures and dislo- cations occur in pedestrian accidents. In a study on pedestrian fatalities (33) 25 fatalities due solely to neck injuries were found in 232 pedes- trians, many above the C3 level. In such cases it was postulated that the neck was fractured by hyperextension or by forceful sideward bending. Recently Tharp and Tsongos (74) stated that pedestrian neck injuries often occur without any contact with an impacting surface, in "a whiplash type of event in which: a) the pedestrian's body is contacted at high speed, b) the body is acc- elerated rapidly to the vehicle's speed, and c) the forces required to accelerate the head must be exerted through the neck and these exceed the strength tolerance of the neck." A neck fracture thus can occur without head contact, produced by inertial loading or excessive acceleration forces. Fruin and Perotte (20) presented a case of an 8-year-old female pedestrian who sustained an atlanto-occipital dislocation without evidence of fracture or head impact. By a personal communi- cation, the authors indicated that there were no abrasions, lacerations, or contusions to the head, nor any skull fractures. In another report (37) of neck fracture with- out head contact a lap-shoulder belted front right passenger (22-year old female, 5'2", 100 lb) was riding in a 1969 Oldsmobile Delta 88, when it was struck head-on by a 1970 Ford pickup truck at an estimated traveling speed of 45-55 mph for both vehicles. Her injuries were an abrasion across her anterior chest wall from the upper right to the lower left, a fracture of the mid portion of the right clavicle, a fracture of the atlas (lam- ina and pedicles) with minimal subluxation and no neurologic deficit. Four cases of neck fractures without head impact in lap-shoulder belted car crash victims have been reported by Taylor et al. (73). The patients had shoulder-belt marks on the sides of their necks. Three had "hangman's fractures" of of the axis; the fourth had an anterior lateral subluxation of C5 on C6 with bilateral crushing of the lateral masses.

Burke (8) cited a 60-year old male driver who hit a tree at high speed while wearing a lap- shoulder belt. His only reported injuries were a forward subluxation of the C6 on C7 with quad- ruplegia. He had a pre-existing narrowing of his spinal canal from cervical spondylosis. No head impact was reported. A lap-shoulder belted 69-year old male phy- sician reported on his own cervical fracture- automobile crash (36). He crashed his car into a ditch. His head "went forward but didn't hit anything." He sus- tained fractures of the sternum and of the odon- toid process. In a review article on car crash injuries, Voight (78) reported that fractures of the dens may occur when the front of the vehicle is raised on impact with the upper portion of the chest wall or the lower neck striking the instrument panel, allowing the head to continue forward. Other fractures of the cervical spine in lap- shoulder belted car occupants involved in crashes have been reported. Hamilton (28) described two cervical fractures in lap-shoulder belted front seat passengers. One, a 25-year-old female, had a flexion-compression fracture of T1 without any head impact. Arndt (2) reported cases of lap-shoulder belted drivers with fractures of the left trans- verse process at T1 (two cases), and two fractures at C7 and Tl, and C4, Tl, and T2. These were reportedly due to excessive neck movements rela- tive to the shoulder belt which stabilized and restrained the upper torso. In another case report (30) a patient wearing a lap-shoulder belt was a passenger in a car that struck the rear of another. She had a fracture of the odontoid process, and there was no sign of head impact. In a report of 177 fatalities in 139 vehicle crashes three auto occupants suffered fatal neck and chest injuries without head impact, in side impact crashes (32). Stott et al. (72) presented a case in which a 1973 model Chrysler Charger V 8 (right hand drive) hit a pole. Impact to the rear of the drivers' seat produced per- manent side crush about 30 inches long. The dri- ver, involved in a right angle impact, survived with a fractured pedicle of the second cervical fracture due to lateral bending over the shoulder belt; no head impact was reported. A case of a fatal cervical cord injury in a swimmer has been reported (44). A 16-year old boy made a normal, usual, rapid underwater turn during a meet. His movements became "clumsy"; he finished swimming the length of the pool with ob- vious difficulty and after being pulled from the pool he collapsed and died shortly thereafter. No neck fracture or dislocation was found at autopsy but the central cord area was edematous from the medulla to at least the C4 level. Recent peri- vascular hemorrages were noted about the C2-C3 level. The rapid sequence of voluntary hyper- flexion, torsion and hyperextension is considered the mechanism of this injury. CASE HISTORIES OF HEAD INJURIES WITHOUT IMPACT The Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) of The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is the repository for all detailed reports of in-depth mul ti di s ci pi i nary accident investigations conduct- ed throughout North America. Some 39 different teams from throughout the United States and Canada have provided accident data for this computer file. Data collected for each case include the environmental characteristics of the crash, ve- hicle information, and precise detailed descrip- tions of occupant injuries. This file is biased: the more severe collisions and the more serious injuries are more often included. The vehicles are relatively new cars, most having occupant safety features such as high penetration resistant (HPR) windshields, padded instrument panels, im- proved door locks, collapsible steering columns, padded sunvisors, and lap-shoulder belts. The following cases were found in the HSRI files: A 197 2 AMC Gnemlln 2-dm. coupe wa 6 stnuck In the lelt Aide by a 1964 Fond Falcon. Damage was to the dnlven' s do on. and to the B- pillan Immed- iately behind It. The 17-yean-old lap-shoulden belted male dnlven (5' 7", 157 lb) s obtained a dislocation ol the atlas lnom the base ol the skull with ligamentous teaming, bnulslng ol the spinal cold, abdominal Inj unies, and othem mlnorn Inj unies about the body. His Inactunes ol the neck wene ola dislocation type; no head contact was Indicated by the Investigalo ns ol this cnash ( Sl-00018 ). A 19 73 Dodge Cononet 4-dn. sedan was stmuck In the lelt side by a 1971 Dodge Cononet. The unnestnalned 54- yean- old male dnlven ol the 1973 Cononet (S' 10", 2 30 lb) was stnuck at his doon . He sustained a mldaxlllany linean abnaslon, had cnepltus ol the antenlon uppen lelt chest ( lelt doon), and an abnaslon below the lelt elbow (doon and! on anmnest) . He had a cenvlcal Inactune and was dead on anni v al (candlac annest) . Thene w ene no Inj unies neponted about his head on lace (UM- 832). A 1973 Toyota Conolia 4-dn. tunned In the path ol a motoncycle. The Impact caused the automobile to nolioven onto Its night side. The 17-yean-old (5' 2", 110 lb) lap-shoulden belted Iemale dnlven ol the Toyota had a Inactune ol the llnst cenvlcal ventebna wilh tnansectlon ol the medulla, and s evene Inj unies 0 1 the pelvis and lowen extneml- tles. Also, thene wene abnaslons ol the hands and lace. This Is an example ol latenal whiplash In- juny without any necond ol head contact (l/M 73004). In an attempt to find additional unpublished cases, approximately 2,200 U.S. and Canadian neuro- surgeons were sent a brief questionnaire regarding their recall knowledge of cervical fractures with- out loading or trauma to the face or head. A total of 267 responded to this inquiry. Forty neurosurgeons recalled such cases and enumerated some details citing a total of 78 cases, not in- cluding pathological fractures. There are un-</page><page sequence="4">472 D. F. HUELKE, ET AL. doubtedly many more cases than the 78 reported. It is interesting that three cases of fracture- dislocation occurred in falls in which victims landed on their buttocks. There were also two cases cited in which sudden head turning resulted in fracture or fracture-dislocation. There was one instance of a hangman's fracture. It appears that in all of the above cases cervical fractures and/or dislocations were sus- tained by inerti al or acceleration loading of the neck, i.e., not by direct impact to the head or neck. Although some of these individuals were lap-shoulder belted, it has been documented that lap-shoulder belted occupants are less likely to sustain fatal or severe injuries when compared to their unrestrained counterparts (8, 35) under similar circumstances. CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA In recent years reports of experimentally induced neck fractures and/or dislocations have increased our knowledge of neck injury mechanisms and human tolerances. In laboratory experiments anthropomorphic dummies, live human subjects or cadavers, lower primates or other animals have been used to study the kinematics and the mechana- isms of cervical spine injury. Experimental studies of hyperextension in- juries, using lower primates, rabbits, or other experimental animals which accelerated with the head free to move but not allowed to strike any- thing, have produced soft-tissue damage, hemor- rhaging, ligamentous damage, fractures and dislo- cations, and cord injury in the cervical area (26, 45-47, 61, 80-82). Studies in human volunteers and cadavers (54, 55) have determined biomechanical data on neck torque, shear, and tension in hyperextension and hyperflexion. Other reports have also added to our knowledge of neck tolerance to impact in human subjects (17, 18, 22, 48, 49). In an unpublished experiment (75), a Seattle orthopedic surgeon allowed himself to be rear- ended in February 1958. He sat unrestrained in the drivers' seat of a 1950 Ford 2-dr. sedan as it was struck from behind by a 1949 4-dr. Chrysler sedan at 10 and 20 mph. The left door was remov- ed from the Ford to facilitate high speed cinema- tography (450-550 frames per second). The driver of the Chrysler wore a lap seat belt and the steering wheel was specially padded. Analysis of the high-speed movies by one of the authors (JS) revealed that the subject's head, neck, and torso moved rearward without significant change in position relative to each other until the torso and shoulders bottomed out on the seat back. The head continued to move backward without rotation, inducing a serpentine configuration in the cer- vical spine. Following this, the head violently rotated rearward 120 degrees, hyperextending the cervical spine. The pelvis and lower torso then moved forward releasing the hyperextension loads on the cervical spine. The subject denied any significant pain or disability but admitted that 6 months later his neck still occasionally hurt. Using human cadaver specimens on an accel- eration sled, Schmidt et al. (64) produced neck fractures and fracture-dislocations in both forward and rearward decelerations. Similar research by Clemens and Burrow also demonstrated neck fractures without head impact (11). Several other studies have documented neck fractures of lap-shoulder belted cadavers in forward deceler- ations, fractures produced without head contact (12, 55). A recent biomechanics study using unembalmed human cadavers in simulations of frontal force crashes showed cervical fractures in two subjects (61). One, a 74-year-old female, was found to have a fracture of C7 with cord transectic... This injury was attributed to inter- action of the upper thorax and lower anterior neck with the steering wheel rim. Similarly, a 72-year old male had a fracture in the C7/T1 region due to the same type of interaction with the steering wheel. Both tests were conducted with a crash severity of 33 mph and 206 average deceleration. In both cases the torso was decelerated, allowing the head-neck complex to flex over the steering wheel, and there was no direct head impact. DISCUSSION Volunteer, primate, and cadaver studies (18, 48, 58, 75, 77) have revealed that the cervical spine acts as a highly flexible and extensible link between the head and the torso. When the torso and lower body of a vehicle occupant are accelerated the unsupported head tends to slow the motion of the thorax because of the flexibility of the cervical spine. As the torso moves beneath the head, the cervical spine assumes a serpentine configuration. Ligaments then reach their limit of extensibility, producing a checkrein effect on the vertebrae, and finally the head. In hyper- extension the anterior longitudinal ligament of the upper thoracic and lower cervical spine would appear to be the first to reach the limits of extensibility. This tightening initiates the serpentine spine configuration which appears first in the lower cervical area and then moves cephalad as a wave formation. The upper cervical vertebrae then flex, causing the posterior ligaments to tighten and ultimately initiating head rotation. Intervertebral discs and facet joints play a role in these kinematics (27). The geometric configuration of the facet joints imposes strict limits on the range of motion in extension and lateral flexion of the cervical spine. In most subjects, ligamentous elasticity is necessary to achieve full range of motion permitted by bony configuration. "Muscular tone" or "athletic conditioning" plays a role in this phenomenon. Ballet dancers and swimmers, in particular, require a high degree of flexibility to perform competi- tively and more closely reach the bony geometric limits of their joints. In contrast, a sedentary, elderly subject no longer uses full range of motion of the joints, allowing ligamentous tightness to develop. Cervical spine range of motion decreases</page><page sequence="5">FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS 473 with advancing age, in part, because of this phenomenon (65). The elasticity and hysteresis of articular cartilage of the facet joints and of the inter- vertebral discs become factors limiting joint motion in the cervical spine. Articular cartilage and intervertebral discs deform in normal joint motion and are energy absorbers, particularly as the limits of joint motion are approached. Subchondral bone (bone beneath the supporting articular cartilage) and the end plates of the cervical vertebral bodies also provide energy absorption (59). Minimal deformation occurs with physiologic motion. Rigidity develops in sub- chondral bone in osteoarthritis and traumatic arthritis. The role of the musculature is more difficult to assess in injury causation and injury toler- ance. Experimental studies in volunteers under- going subinjury threshold accelerations, however, indicate that the active musculature plays a highly protective role (29, 77). Accident investigation reveals that tensing of the cervical spine muscu- lature in anticipation of impact may significantly protect or mitigate injury (71). Fractures and distractions of the thora- columbar spine due to inerti al forces or acceler- ations are well known. These usually are sustained in lap-belted automobile occupants or in airplane pilot ejections (34, 38, 41, 63, 69). In automo- bile crashes, for example, the lap belt restrains the pelvic area but allows dynamic torso hyper- flexion over the belt which may cause fracture dislocations, as described by Smith and Kauf er (69). In such cases there is no direct force applied to the buttocks or shoulder area. Even in unrestrained individuals in automobile crashes there can be vertical forces acting on the thora- columbar spine causing hyperflexion similar to that which is seen in pilot ejections (34, 41, 63). Some of the cervical injury cases reported here were due to similar mechanisms. In these subjects there had been restraint of the upper torso region by a lap-shoulder belt or by a speci- fic car structure, resulting in hyperflexion, hyperextension, or lateral bending of the neck. In some cases direct loads were applied to the lower anterior neck. The interactions of the flexible linkages of the spinal elements of the neck and the loads ap- plied to the neck by the dynamics of the vehicle and occupant can produce the types of injuries reported in this paper. It is concluded that head impact is not necessary for cervical injuries to occur. REFERENCES 1. Aitken, A. P., Bradford, C.H.: End results of ruptured intervetebral discs in industry. Am. J.
