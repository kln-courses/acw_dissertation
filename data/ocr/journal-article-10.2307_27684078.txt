XI, 218 S. 64 Abb. 6,50 $. The thesis of this study is that Wolfram von Eschenbach (p. XIII) developed Con tes del graal by Chr?tien de Troyes into his own Parzival chiefly by using themes taken from the Graeco-Roman Hermetic litera ture. The authors also argue that Chr?tien himself may have used Hermetic materials (155-62) when he took ?the stories of the Grail? from a book given him by Count</page><page sequence="2">842 Gnomon 1966 Philip of Flanders. They trace parallels between the Contes del graal - briefly re lating the title to the Hermetic krater (pp. 158-59) - and the Hermetic Asclepius, while reiterating the claim that Apuleius' Metamorphoses were also an important source. In this connection they have ne glected to observe that most of the 12 th 13 th century manuscripts of the Asclepius place it among the philosophical works of Apuleius. There is no necessity, therefore, for suggesting that the book used by Chr? tien ?may have been the Latin translation of a Syriac or Arabic version of the trea tises, brought back by Count Philip from his stay in the Holy Land? (p. 156). To return to the main thesis, the au thors argue that Wolfram's knowledge of the Herm?tica was not direct but was given him orally by a certain Kyot, a real person to be identified with William of Tudela, author of the first part of the Chanson de la croisade albigeoise (on cdas Kyotpro blem' cf. R. Lowet, W. von Eschenbachs P. im Wandel der Zeiten, 1955, 13-110). What Kyot had was an Arabic version of the Herm?tica, which he related to Wolf ram in French. It was Arabic because Kyot twice refers to the tale of Parzival as ?heidensch geschriben? (416, 25; 453, 11, ed. A. Lietzmann). According to the authors, Wolfram him self provides the key for this discovery be cause he indicates that (1) the authority for the story is hidden (2, 5-8) and unwritten (115, 29-30); (2) Kyot found it in Tudela (D?l?t, 453, 11-14); (3) it was age-old and true, foretold by Plato and ?Sibille din prof?tisse?; its theme is that redemption for the greatest guilt will come (465,19-27). The authors use this mention of Plato and the Sibyl to pass to Lactantius, who referred to Plato and Hermes Termaximus (De ira 11, 11-12) and also to Trismegistus and the Sibyls (Div. inst. 4, 6, 3) and stated that these authorities agree with the pro phets in regard to the Son of the Supreme God. In order to obtain a reference to re demption, the authors have to claim that it is ?implied in reference to the power of the Son? (p. 4). Since the Sibyl (if not the Herm?tica) is in fact mentioned by Wolfram, we may wonder if the Sibylline Oracles (cf. 8, 139) or Sibylline literature generally do not pro vide a better source for his mention of the phoenix (469, 7-13) than the Herm?tica do. The most unusual aspect of Wolfram's lines lies in his description of the new and beautiful plumage of the bird, and a simi lar emphasis is to be found in the poem De ave phenice (125-44) ascribed to Lactan tius (cf. J. Hubaux-M. Leroy, Le mythe du ph?nix, 1939, 36). The authors have to admit that the phoenix ?does not appear directly in the Hermetic texts? (p. 108) - adding the word ?directly? to Festugi?re's ?ne para?t pas? (La r?v?lation d'Herm?s Trism?giste, 3, 1953, XI). In a chapter on cthe transmission' the authors argue that the Herm?tica reached Wolfram through Arabic versions. (1) He mentions ?Tebit? as a wise man (643, 17); this is Th?bit b. Qurra, a 9th-century Sa bian born in Harran, Mesopotamia, where we know a form of Hermetism flourished; Thabit himself wrote a book on Hermes. In the 13 th century Bar Hebraeus men tions dialogues of Hermes with Tat as still extant in Syriac. Were they extant in Arabic ? It is suggested that though there are no traces of the Corpus Hermeticum in Arabic, nevertheless there were many Arabic Herm?tica. It is also claimed that ?Trevrizent? is derived from treble escient (from triplex scientia, in turn from the Arabic Mutallat al-hikma, the equivalent of Trismegistos). One wonders if the de tour into Arabic is really necessary. The main part of the book is devoted to thematic parallels to Parzival from the Herm?tica. First comes the 'Gottesbegriff3 (cf. G. Weber, Der G. des Parzival, 1935). It is hard to see why the themes involved must be derived from the Herm?tica rather than from traditional Christian theology: God is not anthropomorphic but infinite (Trinity), incomprehensible, immutable, Light (with Love as in the Johannine lite rature), gracious, truthful (cf. John 1, 17), Father of the Word, etc. In spite of some exaggerations, one might well consider the views of J. C. Daniels, S. J., Wolframs Parzival, S. Johannes der Evangelist und Abraham bar Chija (Disquisitiones Caro linae 11, 1937). The authors adduce no few er than five Hermetic passages on 'nous' to illustrate the line (797, 30), ?Sin geist mac gr?ze helfe tuon?, but none of them illustrates it. The Grail itself is next deriv ed from the Greek xpar/jp (not a new idea; cf. the references in H. J. Koppitz, Wolf</page><page sequence="3">E. Birley: Erich Swoboda t 843 rams Religiosit?t, 1939, n. 83, p. 424) through Latin cr?tera, and identified with the xpocryjp of Corpus Hermeticum 4. But as Koppitz points out (198) Wolfram's Grail is clearly derived from ?el graal? in Chr?tien de Troyes, whether or not cr?tera &lt; gr?l. We conclude that in spite of the remarkable ingenuity of the authors their thesis is not demonstrated. The 64 illustrations at the end of the book include portrayals of such diverse subjects as ?ibis-headed Thoth?, ?beard ed Hermes? and ?youthful Hermes?, ?Isis?, ?Rapture?, ?Saturn with a Crutch?, ?Saint-Antonin, Town Hall?, and finally ?The grail community, twentieth century? (Bayreuth). They are supposed to ?illus trate the principal elements of our story?, but their relationship to the thesis is not altogether obvious. Chicago Robert M. Grant</page></plain_text>
