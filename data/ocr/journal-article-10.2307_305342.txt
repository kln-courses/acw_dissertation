<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Boris Pasternak. In the Interlude: Poems 1945-1960. Tr. into English verse by Henry Kamen, Foreword by Sir Maurice Bowra, Notes by George Katkov. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1962. xiv, 250, $7.00. (Also available in paper at $1.50, without the Russian text. ) Prefaces, like jacket blurbs, are best ignored. But when, as in the present, they spread illogic and misinformation, it is impossible to pass over them chivalrously. In his preface, Professor Bowra makes a number of statements which, combined with Mr. Kamen's translations, serve to place Pasternak within a reductive tradition, namely the Pre-Raphaelite, in which he does not belong. Furthermore, English Pre-Raphaelitism with its enchanted woods and crying winds of which one finds some analogues in the later Pasternak (although in him these images really belong to what Professor Poggioli has called the poet's "anthropomorphic pathos, " which links him more nearly with the "Neo-Romantics"), offers comparisons which are not only misleading but also limited to the later and poorer work of the poet. Most sensible critics agree that Pasternak's best work belongs to such volumes as Life, My Sister ( 1922), Themes and Variations ( 1923), The Year 1905 (1927), and The Second Birth (1932). His poems of these years are the powerfully imaginative ones which had such a revolutionary and salutary effect on his contemporaries. The poems in these volumes are full of surrealistic, autonomous images, planijunctive metaphors in which two seemingly disparate levels of experience are yoked by sheer imaginative force, and lines driven by startingly active verbs. By com- parison, the later poems are passive and adjectival. But to call Pastemak's work at any time "classical" (viii) is to completely misrepresent it, and to assert that these translations catch "this classical quality" (viii) is to dignify them out of all proportion. Professor Birkenmayer points out the many inaccuracies in translation. I should like to deal with these renderings on another level, that of their pretention to being English verse. Mr. Kamen's Pasternak is self-indulgent, uncraftsmanlike in his diction, and sentimental. It must be pointed out, however, that many of the infelicities one finds here are not those of Pasternak's originals. But listen to the English: "And though the night may forge and weld/ Its chains of grief to make me stay, " (p. 23) (bad Gordon Bottomley); "There's chattering no more" ( p. 33) ( inversion 308 SEEJ, Vol. VII, No. 3 (1963)</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 309 for rhyme's sake); "For life is but a moment,/ Is only a dissolving/ Of ourselves into others, / Life is simply a giving, " (p. 35) (the sort of puerile wisdom found in Sturge Moore which Yeats had sense enough to delete from his own work). I could go on. But why? Suffice it to say that Mr. Kamen may indeed have that "command of English verse" Pro- fessor Bowra claims for him (viii) but it is, to my mind, a command of the worst English verse. Mr. Kamen anglicizes Pasternak. I would not quarrel with this, but the English Pasternak is third-rate, nostalgic and abstract as in: "Straight to the soul of days now gone, / The source from which they flow, /To theirfoundations, to their roots/ And to their very core; " (p. 101) -and transplanted to a tradition to which he is in no way related. Messrs. Bowra and Kamen, like so many contemporary students of Soviet literature, are lost in the ideological desert of the cold war. The Pasternak they envision, "unpolitical" (vii) and with "his faith in the Russian Revolution waned" (vii), is a wish in the manner of any mirage. Pasternak's volitional disengagement is hardly "unpolitical. " It is po- litical to the utmost degree, but more than that it is a natural stage in Pasternak's career as a poet. He was never otherwise. But the Paster- nak industry continues in the West, making out of him a lonely, alienated, politically disillusioned man more in accord with its own sentimental re- duction of our relationship to Soviet society than with any objective reality. Oswald LeWinter Columbia University This volume is one more attempt to familiarize the English-speaking world with Pasternak's poetry. Besides the poems from Doctor Zhivago, it includes the poems written between 1958 and the author's death ( 1960). In the Translator's Note we read, among other things, the following statement: "I have aimed primarily at exact translation and have taken no liberties with meaning; theEnglish is as close as possible." ( p. xiii) Unfortunately, these words have a hollow ring when Mr. Kamen's transla- tions are compared with the Russian original. Practically all translators of Pasternak (and Mr. Kamen is no excep- tion to this rule) fail to reproduce the basic elements of the poet's style. Pasternak is well known for his masterly use of colloquialisms; without them, his poetic diction loses much of its freshness and vigor. Moreover, his style is terse; he hates verbosity. Every word used by him has its own precise meaning. All this can be seen, for example, in the following passage from Vesehznjaja raspz'tica (Spring Floods): I zv6nu ?llpavsix podk6v Dor6goj vtorila vdog6nku Vodd v vor6nkax rodnik6v (p. 16). In Mr. Kamen's translation, this passage reads: And as the ringing horseshoes galloped by, Within the hollow-echoed streams The water followed with its clear reply (p. 17).</page><page sequence="3">310 The Slavic and East European Journal The verb s7lpat', whatever it may suggest in Russian, certainly does not imply either ringing or galloping-all the more so because the preceding stanza clearly indicates that the horseman rode slowly (tasbilsja, p. 16) likewise, rodnik6v (p. 1 6) refers to fresh-water springs, not "streams" (p. 17). These, in turn, are not "hollow-echoed" (p. 17); at least, this is not what v vor6nkax means. In short, Pasternak's diction is diluted, his meaning distorted, and his poignant terseness replaced by needless verbosity, Mistranslations, or inadequate translations, can be found on almost every page of the book. Sometimes a simple Russian sentence is twisted beyond recognition when translated into English as, for example, Ja ljubljf tvoj zamysel uprja'myj (p. 2), which is rendered as "Unswervingly your purpose holds my love" (p. 3). Often two dictionary meanings, neither of them correct, are given for one Russian word: thus, neotvratim is translated as "destinate and uhconcealed" (p. 3). Vsi' tbnet v farisbjstve is not exactly "Now is the time of the Pharisees" (p. 3). An example of outright mistranslation is "the constant stream's sleepless refrain" (p. 5), allegedly the equivalent of the Russian Ruiejkdv bess6nnyx bol - tovnjd (p. 4). The future tense in the last stanza of Mart (March) means nothing to the translator, who blissfully changes it to the present tense (unless he thinks that sm6lknut on p. 10 is the present tense). It would serve no purpose to go through the remainder of the book and enumerate even the most obvious errors, omissions, and distortions: this has been done already, with devastating thoroughness, by Vladimir Markov (Slavic Review,XXI, No. 4, pp. 769-771). Suffice it to say that Mr. Kamen's mishandling of Pasternak's poems has resulted in yet another amputated version of the flesh-and-blood poetry of the original. Sigmund S.
