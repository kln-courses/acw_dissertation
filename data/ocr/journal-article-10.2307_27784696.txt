<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fate Stevens: The Final Fiction. By B. J. Leggett. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2005. 170 pp. $36.95. What's surprising is that B. J. Leggett's thesis about Wallace Stevens' late poems should appear at all new: essentially that his developmental arc as a poet traces his more and more explicit encounter with the "less and less human [...] savage spirit" (CP 327-28), or, in other words, with the real real. For Leggett, this spiritual rendezvous occurs full force both in the poems collected in The Rock and those written afterwards. Leggett addresses, among others, "The Plain Sense of Things," "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour," the eponymous "The Rock," "The Green Plant," "Looking across the Fields and Watching the Birds Fly," "To an Old Philosopher in Rome," "Not Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself," and last poems like "The World as</page><page sequence="2">South Atlantic Reviezv 263 Meditation," "The Sail of Ulysses," "As You Leave the Room," "The Course of a Particular," and "Of Mere Being." To be sure, Leggett suggests that we get intimations of Stevens' detecting a "cosmic imagination" in post-War poems like "Credences of Summer" and especially "The Auroras of Autumn." But one can plausibly regard even them as partially beholden to Stevens' epistemo logically tense substitute for religion in modernist times. "Death is the mother of beauty" in his Harmonium period, an aesthetic spur. Subsequently, he tries to make this aesthetic-existential vision respon sibly ethical: to find a "supreme fiction" rife with social "ideas of order." Only from the late forties to his death does Stevens' faith in the self-resurrecting powers of the imagination hit the wall. In Final Fiction, Leggett reverts to a method defining his two earlier books on Stevens' early and mid-career poetry. Poems get produced, are, in essence, made meaningful to begin with, and so might best be read and interpreted, by virtue of other kinds of texts marking the poet's environment at the time of a particular poem's composition. Leggett prefers to emphasize the philosophical "intertext," but less as a matter of direct influence than how it can help one "determine [...] the significance of key elements of the poems" (30). Arguably, most critics implicidy use this method. Leggett, however, means to interpret poems according to informed speculations about what readings affect ed the poet when he was writing a particular poem. For example, what with its "stale grandeur of annihilation" senti ment, Stevens' vision in "Lebensweisheitspielerei" derives from (note its German tide) Stevens' likely reading of a 1924 translation, owned by him, of Schopenhauer's Wisdom of Ufe (29). Stevens' awareness of "cosmic imagination" in this and other poems in The Rock parallels Schopenhauer's vision of the world as at bottom blind "Will," even if, suggested by the poem's whimsical tide, Stevens happens to reject Schopenhauer's resulting pessimism (32). Less playful is how two of George Santayana's texts impinge on the "liminality" theme (80) in "To an Old Philosopher in Rome." The Santayana figure in the poem looks at his physical surroundings not simply from the point of being about to die, but as if he could now imagine his complete absence via a cosmic will, in terms of which the world now appears entirely as idea. Leggett cites Santayana on this vision: "'The whole world belongs to me implicidy when I have given it up, and am wedded to nothing in particular in it'" (90). Or, in the words of Edmund Wilson on</page><page sequence="3">264 Book Reviews Santayana (yet another intertext for the Stevens poem), the poem's fig ure comes to regard each object around his dying self "as 'a monad in the universal mind'" (85). Leggett's own intertext happens to be the criticisms that he cites throughout his discussions of Stevens' late poems. These include J. Hillis Miller's two "brilliandy wrongheaded" 1970s essays on "The Rock" (94). Deconstructionist criticism may have become passe, but Miller's reading still sticks in Leggett's craw for the way he sees it con tinuing to influence the poem's interpretations. Leggett therefore devotes an entire chapter exposing Miller's misreading of various sec tions of "The Rock," even to the point of citing how he literally mis takes the "of" in the phrase "the cure of the ground" to mean an effort to cure the bare, meaningless real. The "of" instead here means "of belonging to," and so refers to that real's curing us of our anxiety over its very meaninglessness (105). More serious, in using "The Rock" to illustrate language's (and not just the poem's) abyssal irresolution, Miller ends up unwittingly claim ing that any reading of "The Rock" is right, especially ones like his that recognize that they can never be "right." Relying on the poem's inter textual context comprising other poems in The Rock as well, Leggett instead wants to cure the poem precisely of such critical abstraction. In short, he wants "The Rock" to say something: that Stevens' vision of self "seventy years later" has come to nothing(ness), the result of his unflinching awareness of "the cosmic imagination." Miller's para doxical effort to have the poem literally say nothing ? la deconstruc tion ironically fails to convey that vision. Yet Leggett, too, must resort to critical abstraction to expose this failure, as when he asserts: "The audacious premise of 'The Rock' is that the 'particulars] of being' represent an attempted 'cure' offered by some activity contained in the nothingness on which they rest [...] 'that gross universe'" (103). Leggett's critical readings of other poems discussed in Final Fiction are easier to come by and harder to contest, perhaps because the crit ics whom he there engages slide into anthropomorphic biases more blatandy than does Miller. Thus, for example, Leggett's interpretation of "Looking across the Fields and Watching the Birds Fly" dismisses critics who confuse the poem's "Mr. Homburg" with a spiritual vision Stevens supposedly disparages (64), or else who think that the poem as a whole simply affirms the power of human imagination (65-66). As Leggett states it, not only Milton Bates but a host of other reputable</page><page sequence="4">South Atlantic Review 265 Stevens critics apparently "cannot accept a Stevens persona who endorses an epistemology in which the poetic imagination is sub servient to an external entity larger and yet a little like'" (67). It is not hard to see why. Can anyone easily affirm let alone accept a vision of life that Leggett claims Stevens does in "Of Mere Being," where non-human being transcends one's particular life and so "nec essarily survives 'the end of the mind' in death" (141)? Stevens cannot any longer find meaning in an aesthetic of death mothering beauty, which he did all the way up to the period when he argued that a poem "must give pleasure." His late vision of a non-human real lets all that go. It even goes beyond its manifest individuation in Nature or the Emersonian Not-me, say, which some critics associate with Mr. Homburg's position. Alternatively, given his European name and its class pun, one might connect "Mr. Homburg" with a Schopenhauerian figure, whom Leggett in this case frames as having "sought for a world that could be accounted for on the basis of the human" (70). Instead, Mr. Homburg, existing "at the edge of things," again shows how late Stevens ends up imagining himself and his present and past acts of imagination as themselves being imagined by some "cosmic imagina tion," or that "Savage" Other-force "Whose blunt laws make an affec tation of [the human] mind" (CP 517,519). Stevens' "final" or truly "supreme fiction," in short, applies to himself with himself. Leggett sometimes comes close to reifying that force. Retaining the word "imagination" also risks anthropomorphic misreading, even an inadvertent wish to insinuate the governance of a cosmic order cum holy writ. I prefer misreading Leggett on that score. His own Final Fiction drives toward something more no-holds-barred about Stevens' late poems, thus prompting the critical efforts denying it. In that sense, besides offering many provocative readings of the poems, Leggett's work moves beyond the now somewhat "rotted" template of reality imagination, which too often reduces Stevens' works to epistemologi cal play?Juebensweisheitspielerei indeed. Leggett resists that option. His Stevens ends up moving toward an autodidactic, almost Buddhist-like coda, tracing a conversion from former faith in imaginative play to the darker vision of voiding imagination altogether. Stevens' late poems track his collision with the real real, nothing more and nothing less, and as if this were all that one could do. They take place in the no man's land between events of human making?including notions of divine point?and "the nothing that is" (CP 10).
