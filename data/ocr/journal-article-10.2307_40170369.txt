<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Colors of the Earth: Nature and Landscape in the Poetry of Joy Harjo and Humberto Ak' Abal Emanuela Jossa Native poetry, in both North and Central America, is characterized by the use of a trope that issues from a generally shared worldview - namely, the earth's colors as a metaphor for the relationship between humans and nature. To illustrate this literary and cultural phenomenon, I have chosen to analyze the works of two poets of the same generation but of different genders and cultural heritages: Joy H (Tulsa, Oklahoma, born in 1951) and Humberto Ak' Abal (Totonicapan, Guatemala, born in 1952), of the Creek and Mayan K'iche ethnic groups, respectively. As geographically and linguistically distant as the two poets are, they both display a consistent and highly significant use of this trope. Initially, the colors of the earth, intended as a representation of the metaphoric and metamorphic passage from the human to the telluric essence of being, activate a process of identification that is shared by both poets. Subsequently, however, a linguistic analysis of a number of their poems provides clues as to the poet's perception of his or her inner self, and this trope brings to the fore profound emotional and cultural differences between the two writers. In the case of Ak' Abal, harmony is achieved. In the case of Harjo, conflict and separation prevail. I will begin by quoting a few lines from "Remember," a poem included in She Had Some Horses, Joy Harjo's collection on which this study is focused; then I will quote, in its entirety, an unpublished poem by Humberto Ak' Abal. Remember the earth whose skin you are: Red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth, brown earth, we are the earth.

("Remember," 11-18) Embarazada "Cuando yo estaba embarazada, esperandote, sentia muchas ganas de comer tierra, arrancaba pedacitos de adobes y me los comia ..."

I tore pieces of adobes and ate them." My mother's confession broke my heart. I have sucked clay milk. That's why my skin is the color of earth.1</page><page sequence="3">The Colors of the Earth -fr 587 A process of identification with the earth and, in specifically poetic terms, with the earth's colors is central in the two poems - an unequivocal indication that both Harjo and Ak' Abal (indeed, like most native poets) participate in the profound, intimate relationship with nature that all native communities of the American continent share at the everyday as well as cosmogonic levels. In fact, as distant as these levels may appear to be, the natives' existence represents the realization of their cosmic vision in their daily life. For the poets, nature frequently not only provides the initial inspiration but also constitutes the starting point of their search for identity, both individual and collective. This is a signally peculiar trait of native literature. It is intrinsically related to the marginalization that natives experience throughout most of the continent, and it is linked to loneliness, violence, and even the denial of life. The search for identity issues directly from this marginalization and, ultimately, exclusion. In native poetry, the individual's relationship with nature is represented as a dialogue between beings that are part of the same universe. Without this intimate relationship, the individual's body, mind, and spirit would be fragmented and incomplete. Accordingly, in both Joy Harjo's and Humberto Ak' Abal's poems, nature is not merely a backdrop or an object of contemplation but an interlocutor, a witness, and a source of consolation. It is precisely this common nexus with nature that leads to the specificity of the individual poet's utterance. In She Had Some Horses, Harjo's relationship with the landscape takes on the configuration of a dialogue between two beings, whereby the poet searches in nature to find her own self and, she hopes, reconstruct her lost identity. Harjo's verses communicate the perception of a distressing incompleteness, an existential and spiritual vacuum that the poet can fill only if she reconstructs her life in harmonic concordance with nature. Only if the poet's spiritual universe is reflected in the morphology of the American landscape can it overcome this life-denying sense of displace- ment, and the resulting fragmentation of the self. Language, and ultimately metaphor, become the vehicles of the transformation of the body, the landscape, and the city. We have here a modification of the course through which the individual being engages in his or her search for mysterious connections with all the creatures of the land. These are the objects of a constant process of metaphorization that involves a further process of transformation. Thus metamorphosis becomes the basis of identity. In "Remember," the poet establishes a</page><page sequence="4">588 4" Journal of the Southwest strong link between every being and the stars, the family, the plants, and the wind. Humanity is depicted as being relentlessly in motion, whereas the elements of nature acquire anthropomorphic forms - "wind," for instance, is not referred to as it but as she and her. To be sure, uncertainty dominates and complicates this process of identification. The substance of nature, as well as its depiction, is vague and problematic. As we have seen in "Remember," it is through careful observation as well as the evocative language of poetry that the land- scape must be reconstructed. Accordingly, Harjo's poems express two simultaneous processes of re-creation: that of the native woman's iden- tity, and that of the new landscape to which poetry gives birth. Often, as the result of the conflictual relationship whereby the city ostensibly suffocates the explosive energy of the earth, nature seems to founder beneath the white, Christian urban environment. At other times, as in "Anchorage," the city appears to be fragile, at the mercy of the strength of air, water, and fire: Once a storm of bowling earth cracked open the streets, threw open the town. It's quiet now, but underneath the concrete is the cooking earth, and above that, air which is another ocean, where spirits we can't see are dancing joking getting full on roasted caribou, and the praying goes on, extends out. ("Anchorage" 8-16) In many of Harjo's poems, the conflict takes the form of a dialectic between stillness (the city) and movement (the natural landscape): indeed, as she writes, "underneath the concrete / is the cooking earth." In the Creek poet's view, it is from this movement that language is born. Through the word and its sound, poetry renews humanity as well as the earth (the main topic in the vision of North American natives), producing an equation between body and earth, a connection of geog- raphies that cancels out time and space. The earth and the woman give birth according to an explosive, uninterrupted cycle of creation and destruction - witness the myths of gestation that, principally among the Pueblos, the Navajos, and the Apaches, establish a parallel between</page><page sequence="5">The Colors of the Earth * 589 the earth and the primordial womb. The recapturing of the landscape through the memory (or, more precisely, the ancestors' memory) of the land when it was inhabited by the natives, permits one to recover one's consciousness of belonging to it. In "Skeleton of Winter," the poetic voice searches for a creative and regenerative interaction with the Ari- zona and Oklahoma landscapes through images that infuse space with a mythical entity: I am memory alive not just a name but an intricate part of this web of motion, meaning: earth, sky, stars circling my hearth centrifugal. ("Skeleton of Winter" 35-41) Discovering deep connections among the animal, vegetal, telluric, astral, and human worlds, the poet tries to create a new harmony capable of restoring the universe denied to the Creek woman. However, she is still a fragmented being; her identity is still an "intricate part," because she achieves the process of identification with the colors of the earth only with great difficulty. In many of Harjo's poems, identification is nothing more than a tentative longing, an unfulfilled desire, and the fragmentation extends to both the woman and nature. Often it is an uncertain as well as stressful process. At times, fear hinders her recovery of the earth's colors. In "Call It Fear," a poem built around the word edge, this word occurs in a variety of situations and carries different meanings, both concrete and abstract. It refers to both the geographical and the human space: There is this edge where shadows and bones of some of us walk backwards. Talk backwards. There is this edge call it an ocean of fear of dark. Or name it with other songs. ("Call It Fear" 1-6)</page><page sequence="6">590 * Journal of the Southwest "The edge" can be an ocean of fear, but also a fantastic place where bones and shadows walk. The essence of "the edge" depends on the names that the chants give to it. It lives inside the poet: There is this edge within me I saw it once . . . (13-14) It is no longer the sheer drop of the cliff. It has become a string of shadow horses kicking and pulling me out of my belly . . . (27-28) The "edge" is both inside and outside. It shapes an internal as well as an external landscape. The two levels, however, are distinct, and the search for memory in the landscape stops precisely when faced with this limit. In "The Woman Hanging from the Thirteenth Floor Window," the woman "sees Lake Michigan lapping at the shores of herself." She feels as if the landscape is penetrating her until it licks her most hidden parts; even though nature cannot help her, the excision abides. Ultimately, the woman remains hanging from the thirteenth floor, and suicide and salvation are left as equally possible suspended outcomes. The absence of a definite ending derives precisely from this dissociation vis-a-vis the landscape, from this inability to receive comfort from it. On the other hand, it is impossible for the woman not to learn how to listen to nature, which is transformed with her: nature does reveal the truth, or at least the manifestation of something profound - a vision that reveals the meaning of beauty. Landscape can be represented also through a falcon, as in "Con- nection," or through the moon and the wind, two elements that hold special places in the poetry of Joy Harjo. Moon and wind can comfort, and they can be interlocutors or witnesses, as in "The Friday Before the Long Weekend": I can't do anything but talk to the wind, to the moon . . . (32-34)</page><page sequence="7">The Colors of the Earth * 591 Or again, as in "September Moon": Wind blowing my hair was caught in my face. I was fearful of traffic, trying to keep my steps and the moon was east, ballooning out of the mountain ridge, out of smoky clouds out of any skin that was covering her. Naked. Such beauty. Look. We are alive. The woman of the moon looking at us, and we looking at her, acknowledging each other. (11-20) In this poem, the images of the landscape become "mediators of immensity," to borrow from Bachelard - an immensity that has been extended by contemplation. In spite of the decaying world, a comfortable relationship with the moon is created, and the poem propagates waves of pleasure. Elsewhere, however, the moon is deformed, distorted, or even destroyed. In "Backwards," it is thrown from a bridge, and when at the end it returns to the sky, it is "torn at the edges," tragically revealing the failure of dreams when faced with historical reality: as a child, the poet had dreamed of riding on horseback to the moon, but then the white man cut the moon into pieces. The road to reconstruction, therefore, has uncertain exits, and the named elements are hardly assigned the role of fijjurae. This helps clarify the frequently contradictory connotations of the horse: its body is icy while it gallops through fire; it is mute, and yet it is endowed with words. In the poem that gives its title to the collection, the relationship between concept and subject changes with the flow of the animal's evocation: She had some horses. She had horses who were bodies of sand. She had horses who were maps drawn of blood. She had horses who were skins of ocean water. She had horses who were the blue air of sky.</page><page sequence="8">592 * Journal of the Southwest She had horses who were fur and teeth. She had horses who were clay and would break. She had horses who were splintered red cliff. (1-8) If the horses are viewed as a metaphor for the natives, this enumera- tion reveals the complexity of their history. The parallel but contrasting structure of the poem brings to the fore contradictions and tensions that do not cancel each other out but, rather, create an irresolvable riddle, which is the tangled knot of collective memory. For Laura Coltelli, however, the poem's final line points to a way out: She had some horses she loved. She had some horses she hated. These were the same horses. (48-51) Coltelli interprets the last verse as suggesting the unraveling of this rigid binary logic into "paradoxical accumulation and, possibly, disquieting luxuriance" (my translation). For me, the final line instead acknowledges the impossibility of overcoming that logic, reconciling the opposition, and reducing reality to a single, simplistic vision; it communicates the awareness of the extreme difficulty of a dialogue with the past or with all-encompassing nature. The individual's push toward fusion with the landscape seems to be blocked and, virtually, immobilized because of the disintegration of one's sense of self and of the world. By contrast, a lively, harmonious bond with nature characterizes Humberto Ak' Abal's poetry. As an heir of Mayan culture and the grandson of a shaman, Ak' Abal knows that every element of nature is a living manifestation of the cosmic harmony of which humankind is part. Consequently, his relationship with the landscape is sensory, dynamic and, above all, reciprocal - that is to say, it is a relationship between two living beings. This reciprocity is the cognate of Joy Harjo's poetic dialogue, which is oriented towards the construction of another geography that is as much of the body as of the landscape. However, the Mayan poet does not feel the need to reconstruct nature. The landscape is ever-present both around him and inside of him; his sensations vibrate in unison with those of the animal and vegetable worlds. Thus, he finds</page><page sequence="9">The Colors of the Earth ■&gt; 593 his identity reflected in the Guatemalan landscape. His conscience is neither fragmented nor displaced, and there is no need for him to mend fractures or to re-create spaces, because all places are complete in either their majesty or their simplicity, for they all belong to the poet and to the Mayan people. When he is faced with alienation and with the loss of his self ("hoy amaneci fuera de mi / y sali a buscarme"),2 nature presents him with clear answers: Color de agua Busco mi sombra y la encuentro en el agua. Tengo ramas tengo hojas soy arbol . . . Y miro el cielo como lo miran los arboles: color de agua. (Ak' Abal, Ajkem Tzij 247) Color of Water I search for my shadow and I find it in the water. I have branches I have leaves I am a tree . . . And I look at the sky as trees look at it: the color of water. According to the Mayas, humans' ultimate humanity resides precisely in their capacity for metamorphosis. Inherent to a cosmological system of which Ak' Abal is well aware, a perpetual process of transformation takes place, involving all beings on a reciprocal basis. The poet's life and, consequently, his poetry are also part of this process of change. Accordingly, the manifold metamorphoses introduced by the poet who,</page><page sequence="10">594 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest in rapid succession, turns into a tree, a bird, and a nest, is intended not to reestablish a lost oneness but, rather, to recognize it. The poetic dialogue with nature is created and strengthened by this reciprocity - a reciprocity that is peculiar to all indigenous cultures. All beings move rhythmically. They constantly communicate, and for this reason they also share emotional ties. Thus, in Ak' Abal's poems, the natural elements take on touching cognitive and communicative characteristics. Let us reconsider the image of the moon. As we have seen, in Harjo's poems only occasionally can the moon assume a comforting role, whereas in the terrifying final lines of "Backward" it participates as a victim in an overwhelmingly painful scene: The moon came up white, and torn at the edges. I dreamed when I was four that I was standing on it. A white man with a knife cut pieces away and threw the meat to the dogs. (19-25) The poem conveys the tragic feeling of a suffered injustice, which inexorable cruelty empties of all possibility for consolation. In Ak' Abal's verses, on the other hand, the moon enters houses, sits down on the floor, and becomes a shelter for children: Regario La luna era una casa grande sentada sobre el espinazo del cerro. Cuando mi papa me reganaba, yo me iba para la luna y alii dormia. (Ak' Abal, Ajkem Tzij 135)</page><page sequence="11">The Colors of the Earth ■&gt; 595 Scolding The moon was a big house sitting on the back of a hill. When my father scolded me, I went to the moon and slept there. The intimacy between the moon and the Mayan child turns out to be impracticable for the Creek girl, because even the moon itself has been violated and, therefore, is unrecognizable. In Harjo's verses, it survives as a sorrowful idea of violence, dispossession, and expropriation of all places where one might find shelter. This loss of spaces corresponds to the poet's history as a Creek native. The Creeks were expelled from their lands in 1832 and deported to Oklahoma; when oil was discovered there , they were again expropriated from the lands that had been granted to them. As a result, at the beginning of the twentieth century only an impoverished minority of the Creek population remained. Clearly, Ak' Abal also suffers from discrimination, marginalization, and genocidal violence. In the "Hojas rotas" section of Tejedor de palabms, he writes about the tragedy of the Mayan people, but he also shows the strength of their resistance. The basic component of this resistance is linguistic continuity. Ak' Abal not only speaks K'iche but writes in that language - only afterward translating his poems into Spanish. Here lies the main difference between Joy Harjo and Ak' Abal. The former tells us that the Muskogee word for horse is vokko, but in her poems she writes "horse." For the latter, instead, the K'iche language constitutes the epistemologi- cal base of his relationship with the world. The poet's identification with nature is already written in his grammar. The specific character of the Mayan language, which is grounded on lexical play, the metaphorical quality of the sentence structure, and a genius for putting daily life into words, is reflected in Ak' Abal's poetry, as it is in the ancient texts. Through the use of paired formulas, parallelisms, and iterations, the Mayan text creates a harmonic universe based on the deep relationship that links together all beings. Associations, synonyms, and echoes all create a network of semantic connections whereby plant life leads to religious notions and the animal world leads to the notion of morality. Because of this network, everything around the Mayas acquires</page><page sequence="12">596 ^ Journal of the Southwest familiar connotations, prompting a deep awareness of belonging to a specific space. Not so with Joy Harjo, who writes in English but, first, has to undo the underlying mental structure of this language, which conforms to the Western idea that language is constituted in opposi- tion to nature and with the intention of appropriating it (Rogachewskj, 27). Harjo discusses her uneasy rapport with the English language (this "linguistic drama") in Reinventing the Enemy's Language, a collection of Native American stories she edited in 1997. In "The Deer Dancer," included in In Mad Love and War, she appeals to her own language when she wants to express the tragedy of her annihilated world: How do I say it&gt; In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses. I could say it in my own and the sacred mound would come into focus, but I couldn't take it in this dingy envelope. (19-21) On the contrary, as Rogachewskj says, the K'iche language "consti- tuted itself as part of a natural universe which is highly communicative and both expressive and reflexive - and, consequently, the human lan- guage manifests itself as a dialogue with rather than an appropriation 0/nature" (31; my translation). As a poet writing in this language, Ak' Abal has an internal perspective on nature that claims his capacity for feeling and conscience, and therefore his need for a poetical language that enables him to express not only what he feels but also what he thinks about what he experiences. This language often resorts to onomatopoeia. According to the poet, onomatopoeia is a form of communication that speaks directly to the spirit by immediately delivering the essence of meaning through sonorities that suggest the essential qualities of the evoked object. For instance, proj reproduces the noise of the flames, and means "fire"; tish is the noise of the grain being watered, in other words, "irrigated"; tun is the sound of the drum and, therefore, is the name for drum. In short, onomatopoeia stresses the idea of putting a name to an experience by way of sound communication - that is to say, through a dialogue with the substance of nature rather than through the appropriation of a mute and inert object. Thus, for the Mayas, a name is not simply a means of identification but the very essence of the person or the thing or the place. Whereas Joy Harjo does not want to</page><page sequence="13">The Colors of the Earth -fr 597 be "just a name" ("Skeleton of Winter"), when uttering his own name Ak' Abal reaffirms his identity as well as his existence on the earth: the beaten drum makes the sound "turn ab'aj," repeating his name, affirm- ing that he is living in the world: "I am, I am." Consequently, losing a name is like dying: Sin nombre No podre olvidar el ladrido de los chuchos cuando comian a los muertos que se quedaban tirados en los caminos. Los chuchos tambien se comieron mi nombre. ( Retono salvajeI 3 7 ) Nameless I'll never forget the barking of the dogs while they were eating the dead abandoned along the roads. The dogs ate my name too. For the K'iche people, referring to a place by its K'iche toponym means evoking its essence and significance. P sun (not Patzun, as the ladinos of Guatemala say today) means the "place where there is the music of wind," while Tula and other names of cities are integrated by the suf- fix ja, or "home"; in other words, the local name a lready includes the notion of house and of welcoming (Chavez, 186-87). Moreover, the home - or ja - is represented by the human figure, in a metamorphic play which, once again, conveys the deep relationship of reciprocity between all beings:</page><page sequence="14">598 * Journal of the Southwest Ri ja - la casa Uchi'ja (boca de la casa,) Puerta.

Upam ja (stomach of the house,) Interior. Ja, House. The Popol Vuh, the ancient Mayan sacred text, shows us that the word is both evocative and creative. In contrast to the expropriation of sacred places, rivers, and mountains, the Mayan poet, who owns the word, can create an interior landscape contiguous to the exterior one because he possesses the K'iche word. Oficio El poeta debe Uenar vacios y crear espacios. El poema estara completo. (Arder sobre la hoja 63) Work The poet must fill vacuums and create spaces. The poem will be complete. The comforting function and consoling use of name, onomatopoeia and, ultimately, language is precisely what the Creek poet no longer</page><page sequence="16">600 * Journal of the Southwest enjoys. Deprived of the places and of their names, Joy Harjo looks for new sonorities to reassemble that which has been lost. Through strategies of composition designed to do violence to the verse and to compose texts that come alive by means of pauses and accelerations, Harjo creates, in Laura Coltelli's words, "an English language based on a tribal concept of language." Thus, through language, the poet begins to restore her own image. As N. Scott Momaday says, it is through verbal expression, be it oral or written, that people ultimately realize their humanity. &amp; Notes 1 . All translations from Ak' Abal are mine. 2.
