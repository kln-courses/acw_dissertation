It was discovered in 1880 and H. Wankel, K. J. Maška, M. Kříž, K. Absolon, K. Žebera and B. Klíma took an active part in its research. The Předmostí site was settled several times in the course of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic and the overwhelming majority (well over 90 per cent) of the tens of thousands of pieces of the stone industry, as well as the entire bone industry and works of art discovered here come with certainty from the so-called main cultural layer, from Pavlovian. The relatively rich collection of bone instruments of diverse shape have not yet been published as a whole, only isolated reproductions of few pieces are known. The analysis of the complete collection of bone tools kept at the Anthropos Institute shows that their composition has the specific features of the central European Pavlovian. Most shapes lack analogies in the west European Upper Palaeolithic cultures. Practically the same holds also for eastern Europe, only few, sporadically scattered artifacts of this kind have been discovered. Předmostí, Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov, three sites yielding practically identical bone inventory, form the core of Pavlovian, with its highly developed art and rich stone and bone industries. This article is a reprint of a previously published article (Valoch K., 1982: Anthropologie (Brno) 20, 1: 57–69). KEY WORDS: Předmostí – Pavlovian – Paleolithic – Bone tools – Ivory tools – Reindeer-antler tools The settlement of mammoth hunters embedded in the generations of researchers – the latest were conducted by loess near Předmostí in Central Moravia is undoubtedly B. Klíma in 1971–1975 – and numerous references to one of the best-known Palaeolithic localities anywhere in significance of Předmostí and its cultural remains in all Europe. The site began to be excavated by J. Wankel in the literature about Palaeolithic, it happened that not only 1880, so the history of research here dates back more than stratigraphy and excavation features but also material 100 years. Despite excavations performed by multiple relics from this site remained as good as unknown. This article is a reprint of a previously published article "VALOCH K., 1982: Die Beingeräte von Předmostí in Mähren (Tschechoslo- wakei). Anthropologie (Brno) 20, 1: 57–69."

However, and observations by J. Wankel, K. J. Maška, M. Kříž, all of the objects were presented for the first time as J. Knies and K. Absolon scattered in excavation logs and a complete collection, whose overall character expressed various publications were comprehensively and lucidly the specific traits of Pavlovian – the Central European published (Klíma 1970, Absolon, Klíma 1977).

The discovery Institute and some small assemblages were stored in of these morphologically specific artifacts in the last two several Moravian regional museums and private decades of the 19th century was a historic event because collections. statistical recording of the material became it was the first time that an inventory appeared in Europe impossible, it is welcome that the Institute of Archaeology which was different from French standards and did not of the Academy of Sciences has published the numerous find its analogies earlier than some decades later in Dolní drawings by K.

The unique character of these stock of types was documented, even though without any artifacts was so conspicuous that H. Obermaier declared stratigraphic division.
