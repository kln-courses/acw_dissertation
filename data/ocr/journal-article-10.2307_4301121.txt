<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIEF SCULPTURES FROM PERSEPOLIS A group of relief sculptures from the Per- sian royal seat of Persepolis 1 is sufficiently large to convey a true impression of the ex- traordinary refinement and uniformity of Achaemenid art under Darius (521-485 B.C.) and his successors. Fastidiously designed, perfectly wrought, indifferent to human personality, they express the spirit of the monarchy, for the Achaemenids were im- perialists of the coldest type. As a Persian noble exclaimed: Cyrus was a father, Cam- byses was a master, but this Darius is a huckster. "Darius, the Great King, the King of kings, the King of lands, King of this wide earth, son of Hystaspes, the Achaemenid," as he names himself, founded the platform and palace of Persepolis to impress upon en- voys and tributaries the vast extent of his empire, the majesty of the reigning family, and the protective intimacy of their God Ahura Mazda. The principal theme of all Persepolis sculpture, embellished with cer- tain cosmological symbols, is the King en- throned, the supporters and guards of the throne, and the variously clad and armed peoples of the provinces bringing at the festi- val of New Year their characteristic offerings to the King: chariots, horses, sheep, kine, camels, lions, metalware, jewels, bows, rai- ment, and produce in all kinds. "Now if thou thinkest: How many were the lands that King Darius possessed! then look on the representations of the bearers of the throne; then wilt thou know, then wilt thou be informed that the spear of the Persian has advanced far away, then wilt thou be informed that the Persian has defeated the fighter far away beyond Persia." Two reliefs in the Winthrop Bequest represent provincials in Median dress bear- ing up a stairway, respectively, a kid, (fig- ure i) and a pair of bowls containing tribute in kind, perhaps perfumes or precious stones. In neither case is the relief more than half an inch deep; and it is probable that they were part of the decoration of the Stairway of Artaxerxes III (359-338 B.C.). Other reliefs may be older. Two, cut to a depth of an inch and a quarter and an inch and three quarters respectively, show heads of "Immortals" or archers of the Royal Guard, wearing the crown of spikes FIGURE I MAN BEARING KID (H. 27 IN., W. 14 3/4 IN.) (the kidaris?), such as are everywhere repre- sented in the roles of supporters of the throne, guards, and sponsors introducing the tributaries to the Royal Presence. A strung bow carried on the left shoulder and a quiver at the back are visible upon one relief; part of the quiver baldric and the traces of a Epear in the right hand remain on the other (figure 2). It is possible that these date from the time of Darius himself. The figure of the God Ahura Mazda "Who made this earth, Who made yonder heaven, Who made man, Who made good 1 It is not known when these reliefs were re- moved from the site; they were in England in 1914- 44</page><page sequence="2">PERSEPOLIS RELIEFS things for man, Who made Xerxes King, sole King of many, sole Commander of many" upon another relief (figure 3) may have been part of the decoration of the Hall of a Hundred Columns in the north part of the Persepolis platform, a building which has been attributed both to Darius and to Xerxes (485-465 B.C.). Its size, its content, _ FIGURE 2 HEAD OF AN ARCHER (H. 22 1/2 IN., W. I4 3/8 IN.) and its line of division suggest that it is the missing top of the huge jamb of the south doorway of that structure.2 Ahura Mazda, an almost monotheistic worship of Whom was the gospel of Hystaspes' protege Zara- thustra or Zoroaster, is represented by the addition of an anthropomorphic figure to the old Assyrian winged disc of Assur. It floated above the baldachin of the enthroned King; on the lower block, which is still in situ, were carved the curling ends or attach- ments of the circlet which encompasses Him and the tail completing the birdlike wings of His symbolic vehicle. The sculptor in this case never finished his work: finger-nails, the curls of hair and beard are not indicated. A fine-grained dark limestone, of unusual cohesive strength, is the material employed. The unfinished surface of the Ahura Mazda relief proves that the sculptors used the tooth-chisel as well as the point and the FIGURE 3 AHURA MAZDA (H. 28 3/4 IN., W. I 7 7/8 IN.) chisel. For the delicate cutting of the curls a sculptor's drill must have been used; and an expert modern sculptor 3 estimated about a week as the time necessary for working the curls of one of the beards. It is curious that the reliefs, perhaps be- cause of their often perfect and unweathered surfaces, generally impress spectators as be- ing cut in very hard stone. Weathering may have been delayed, it has been suggested, by a high degree of polish, preparatory for the application of the colours with which these sculptures originally glowed. ERIC SCHROEDER 2 Cf.
