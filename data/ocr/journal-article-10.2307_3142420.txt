<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIBLICAL WORLD VOLUME XLI FEBRUARY 1918 NUMBER 2 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER, MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" That is the challenge which Christianity flung at the feet of science, or what passed as science in the days of the Gnostics. And that is the challenge which Christianity flings at the feet of empirical science today. We believe in God; God who is the Father, revealed by Jesus; God who is the immanent Will of our universe; a God of love and law. Yet this confession of the faith of successive millions in the heavenly Father must ever defend itself against assault. Once Christianity was forced to vindicate its faith in the cosmic Reason; and it saw materialism shrink into an oracular agnosticism. Today our Christian experience itself is tortured into yielding us doubts, and that, too, the psychology of religion. For religion, we are sometimes euphemistically and sometimes bluntly told, has been forced to confess its central illusion. It has a psychology with much information concerning hysteria, hypnotism, alternating personalities, and adolescence; an encyclo- pedic wealth of tribal customs, totems, dances, myths, devils, fairies, and tabu; elaborate questionnaires and convincing statistical curves, sociological inductions and anthropological reductions. But no God. For in the beginning primitive men invented "God" that he might create heaven and earth. Far be it from any serious student of religion to belittle, or in the slightest degree to hinder the ambition of those who would study the human soul in its search for spiritual help. 73</page><page sequence="2">74 THE BIBLICAL WORLD But to study experience and its resultant intellectual conceptions is not to deny an outer world in religion. The psychology of sensa- tion is not the world about us; that will exist however inconclusive may be our metaphysics. The Ptolemaic or the Copernican astronomy is not the sun and the eight planets. Even Uncle Sam, that creature of anthropomorphic patriotism, stands for an unimagined nation with prairies and mountains, legislatures and armies. Religion may have made its gods, but it never made its God. Suppose it had, would you pray to a psychological mood? Would you, indeed, be religious any longer ? To have a belief function well you must not tell yourself it is false. A godless religion would be about as morally effective as an unloaded revolver after the highwayman has discovered its emptiness. No honest man need be afraid of facts. If there be no God, we will not help to make one with stained glass windows, social customs, and theologies. We will face our task in our lonesome, loveless universe, and then, bewildered and protesting, but with souls that have never sought consolation in a comfortable lie, we will fall back into the universe from which we sprang. But it will not be the psychology of religion that will break our faith any more than the pre-Kantian empiricism broke our great- grandfathers' faith. When faith in God the Father fails, it will be because of the world's evil and suffering, its moral enigmas, and its outraged sense of justice. For injustice and sensuality, conscienceless capitalism, and materialistic philosophies are to be overcome, not by the idea of God, but by a real God mighty in battle. With this faith the church dares to face its tasks. With anything less it would be nothing but a group of antiquarian triflers.</page></plain_text>
