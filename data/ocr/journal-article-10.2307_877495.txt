<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN SUNDERLAND The Legend and Influence of Salvator Rosa in England in the eighteenth century JAMES Northcote, in a passage from The Dream of a Painter wrote about a figure who '... trod about in the wild scenery [in the region of the Alps] as if he defied the elements. I took him to be one of a banditti, till my conductor informed me it was no other than Salvator Rosa." This gives one a glimpse of the legend which had, by the end of the eighteenth century in England, grown up around the life of the eight- eenth-century artist. He was seen as a wild, romantic, independent figure, a self-styled outlaw, grimly and stoically laughing at the follies and disappointments of the world, anti-academic, remaining true to the dictates of his own heart and mind, unsullied by any compromise with patrons, conventions or traditions, except those which he himself freely accepted. His art was seen to reflect his personality and character. His work was popularly believed to have con- sisted of rugged landscapes peopled with brigands or banditti. For those who knew more about him, and had actually seen some of his pictures, he was known also as a painter of horrifying and macabre witch scenes and stoic philosophers and hermits. The myth of Rosa's personality was largely dependent on a number of apocryphal stories about events in his life which were widely disseminated during the course of the eighteenth century. Two in particular caught the popular imagination: his supposed capture by and sojourn with the bandits of the Abruzzi mountains, and his supposed part in support of Masaniello in the revolt in Naples in I647. Neither of these events is mentioned by Passeri, Baldinucci or Pascoli. Both these stories were current by the middle of the eighteenth century, one due to Bernardo de Dominici's Vite de Pittori, Scultori ed Architetti Napoletani, which was first pub- lished in 1742-43. De Dominici was responsible for some of the most extravagant legends about Rosa, including the Masaniello myth,3 but he does not mention the story about the stay of Rosa with the bandits of the Abruzzi. G. A. Cesareo, whose Poesie e Lettere edite e inedite di Salvator Rosa, published in I892, effectively scotched most of the Rosa myth, says that Lady Morgan invented the story of Rosa's cohabitation with the bandits,4 but in facc the story was known before as it is related and accepted by William Gilpin in his Essay Upon Prints of I768 (p.83). I suspect that the sources of these legends, and thus the myth of Rosa's personality, were oral rather than written, and that they owe their dissemination to the early Grand Tourists at the end 1 JAMES NORTHCOTE: The Dream qf a Painter, one of the supplements in Memoirs of Sir Joshua Reynolds...

The letters of the Earl of Shaftesbury from Naples, 171 --13, refer to Rosa's life and paiptings,5 and it seems likely that men such as Shaftesbury heard stories, probably suitably exaggerated, from Italians who were old enough to have known Rosa or his contemporaries. Whatever the sources of the myth, it found its most com- plete, and absurd, expression in Lady Morgan's The Life and Times of Salvator Rosa, (1824). Lady Morgan's book, ex- quisitely reviewed and satirized by William Hazlitt in the Edinburgh Review of July, I824, is really a novel on the lines of Anne Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho masquerading as a monograph. Each incident, or alleged event, is drawn out to excessive length and padded with any amount of local colour and pseudo-historical background. Her treatment of sources, all of which she appears to have read, has a cavalier and almost masterful quality. Two instances will suffice. In her narrative on Rosa's captivity by the banditti she writes: '... and though few of his biographers allude to the event, and those few but vaguely [i.e. not at all], yet tradition authenticates a fact, to which some of his finest pictures afford a circumstantial evidence.' (Lady Morgan, op. cit., Vol.I, pp. Io8-og.) Concerning the alleged part of Rosa in the revolt of Masaniello, she wrote in a footnote: 'Passeri and Baldinucci pass over this most important and singular event in Salvator's life. Being Church and State men, and living in due fear of the Inquisition, they probably thought they best served the memory of their friend by this silence'. (Lady Morgan, op. cit., vol.I, p.385). John Constable, with his usual perception, wrote, 'Salvator Rosa is a great favourite with novel writers, particularly the ladies. ..,6 Although the Rosa myth provided an inaccurate picture of the facts of Rosa's life as we now know them, there is a degree of imaginative or poetic truth in. Lady Morgan's book which, allowing for the inevitable distortion of the time of writing, when Byron's star was high, rises above the factual inaccuracies. It is interesting that in the wake of Cesareo's book of I892, V. Cian, in I936,7 attempted to show that Rosa, far from a romantic hero, was a hypocrite, adulterer, coward and reactionary. This other extreme is also wrong, and the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Rosa led a far more domestic life than either extreme would allow. But there is no doubt that Rosa was a romantic, which the contemporary of Byron duly admired. It was, indeed, the close similarity between the Rosa myth and the romantic ideal of the artist held in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, which accounted for much of the strength of Rosa's influence; and his influence was as much dependent on his life and personality as on his works. It is significant that Lady Morgan felt herself fully qualified to write a long monograph on Rosa and his art, although she freely admitted that she had not seen many of his pictures (Lady Morgan, op. cit., Vol.II, p.365). Rosa's art was also misunderstood. It was oversimplified, attention being directed first to the landscape aspect, then, later, to the figure paintings, where the macabre and horrific elements were spotlighted, generally at the expense of the serious 'History' painting side, upon which Rosa himself set most value. This image of Rosa's art was perfectly in tune with the preoccupations of eighteenth-century artists and connoisseurs. He was mainly known as a land- scape painter,8 and his name was linked with Claude and Poussin, whether Nicolas or Gaspard or both it is not always clear. When travel in search of the 'Picturesque' in the British Isles began, it became fashionable to compare the Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland in particular with paintings by these artists. William Hutchinson, in his Excursion to the Lakes, of I776, wrote; 'The paintings of Pousin [sic] describe the nobleness of Uls-water; - the works of Salvator Rosa express the romantic and rocky scene of Keswick; - and the tender and elegant touches of Claude Loraine, and Smith, pencil forth the rich variety of Winder- mere.'9 Rosa's name was used as a label to describe wild and rugged, usually mountainous, scenery, with blasted ex- pressive trees and gloomy and often stormy skies. After the publication of Edmund Burke's A Philosophical Enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful (1757), Rosa's name and the word 'sublime', as applied to landscape, became almost synonymous and interchangeable. His name was invoked by many of the Grand Tourists during their passage over the Alps to Italy, and frequently appears in letters written describing the journey. It is not surprising that many people, including, as we have seen, Northcote, believed that Rosa had painted Alpine scenery, which he had not. James Barry shared this misconception, and wrote to William Burke, the brother of Edmund, on 24th Septem- ber 1766, from Turin: 'All this tract down to Grenoble, one sees was the country Salvator Rosa formed himself upon.' (The Works of James Barry . . ., 1809, Vol.1, p.59). Barry goes on to criticize Rosa's landscapes for not being wild enough to describe the Alpine scenery. Often Rosa's wild landscapes were believed to contain figures of banditti. Indeed this was one of the standards by which paintings were attributed to him, often wrongly, in the eighteenth century. There are, in fact, not as many landscapes as one might expect by Rosa in which decorative or picturesque banditti appear, although there are many pastiches of Rosa's work which contain such figures. The Rocky Landscape with three figures (No.20 in the Hayward Gallery exhibition), at Christ Church, Oxford, is one of the few Rosas of this type. Helen Langdon has also pointed out to me that although storms were popularly associated with Rosa's landscape paintings, no painting by Rosa actually shows a storm in progress. One of the reasons why it was believed that Rosa had painted many pictures of landscapes with banditti was that this type of picture frequently appears in the work of artists influenced by Rosa such as Marco Ricci, and small bandit-like figures continue to appear in the paintings and engravings of artists such as Piranesi and f See BENJAMIN RAND: The Life, Unpublished Letters, and Philosophical Regimen of Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury [ 1900oo], especially pp.469-7o. 6 Quoted in E.

However, undoubtedly the main reason why Rosa was associated with banditti so closely in the eighteenth century was the availability of, and admiration for, Rosa's etchings, the Figurine series, dedicated to Carlo de' Rossi. Many of these figures show brigands or bandits in a kind of 'para- military' armour, mainly deriving from the costumes which appear in the northern prints of Dtirer and his contempor- aries. In Rosa's etched series they appear either alone or in small groups, resting or gesturing. These etchings were widely known in the eighteenth century in England and France, which is proved not only by John Hamilton Morti- mer's pastiches of the I770's, but also because William Gilpin and Joseph Strutt refer to them in their works on engrav- ing,10 and further because a series of twelve etchings by Jean Georges Wille after drawings by Charles Parrocel, entitled Reitres et Lansquenets, was published in Paris in 1753, which is heavily dependent on the Rosa etchings; and because de Loutherbourg produced two etched series of Soldats, 1763 and 1766, which again must derive formally from Rosa's Soldati and Guerrieri." Finally the evidence of numerous sale catalogues in the eighteenth century shows that these Rosa etchings were frequently found in the collections of artists and connoisseurs. One slightly unexpected example of this is Mrs Hogarth's sale catalogue for 24th April, 1790, in which lot 31 appears as: 'Salvator's (sic), Soldiers, and Ghezzi's caricatures.'12 For most artists, these Figurine, which often provided models for bandits inserted into 'Rosa' landscapes, were purely picturesque and amoral figures. When they appeared in landscapes they were there for decorative or formal compositional reasons. But for some artists, and I suspect that John Hamilton Mortimer was the most important of these, the figures were often included to convey a certain intellectual or moral meaning. This was that the sublime and rugged landscape was peopled with figures whose charac- ter echoed the savage grandeur of their setting. Lady Morgan makes this point when discussing the inhabitants of the wild mountainous regions of Italy (Lady Morgan, op. cit., Vol.I, pp.Io6-7) and the concept of climate and physical surroundings affecting character was, of course, a common- place to readers of Montesquieu or, later, Herder. These bandits were, it seems, at least to some, human beings freed from the fetters of society and also in a rather unspecific way at war with governments and established values. As Italian bandits of the seventeenth century they could well have been specifically opposed to the cruel autocracy of the Neapolitan rigime, but in the eighteenth century their meaning was on a more generalized level. What the banditti stood for, and thus what Rosa himself represented, because we have seen that Northcote in his Dream saw Rosa as a bandit, was the standard anti-academic platform. In opposition to Rosa was seen the weight of academic tradition, the constraints of unnatural discipline and the observance of unnecessary convention. The fact that Rosa wished to be known as a great 'History' painter, perhaps not within, but certainly not directly opposed to, the classical academic tradition, was usually ignored or unknown. The series of fifteen etchings, which Mortimer dedicated to Joshua Reynolds in 1778, included two depicting artists of a past age, Salvator Rosa and Gerard de Lairesse. Rosa appears dressed as a bandit, sitting in a landscape with his hand to his heart, studying a book of drawings or engravings of bandits in a landscape in the Rosa manner, whereas Lairesse appears as an old man, leaning on a crutch, walking slowly away from a book which has 'Nature' inscribed on its open page. This suggests that Mortimer is contrasting the methods of the academically trained artist, leaning heavily on a crutch, symbolizing the support, or constraint, of academic tradition, forced to find 'Nature' only in the pages of a book, with the artist who searches for inspiration in his own heart and in the contemplation of nature. The inclusion of the two etchings in a series dedi- cated to Reynolds is a nice irony. The ideas described above remind one of the quotation, taken from Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, which Mortimer himself used in an idealized self-portrait drawing,is and again in the inscrip- tion to his Shakespearian character, Poet, from the same play: 'The Poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rowling, Doth glance from heav'n to earth, frohm earth to heav'n, And as imagination bodies forth The form of things unknown, the Poet's pen Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name.' Act 5, scene I. Shakespeare, as an unclassical poet known for his ability to break the rules and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art, was sometimes compared to Rosa in the eighteenth century. In the European Magazine for January 1795, p.33, an anony- mous writer claims; 'Mr. Garrick, when he was in Italy, used to call Salvator Rosa the Shakespeare of painting... Reynolds himself used Rosa's paintings as an example of 'The original or characteristical style' (Discourse V, line 249); that is, a style of painting which is not of the greatest dignity or nobility, but one that is worthy of note and succeeds because it is wholly consistent and harmonious with itself. Reynolds also mentions Rubens and Poussin as achieving a 'characteristical' style for much the same reasons. It is interesting that Rosa and Poussin were com- pared by the Earl of Shaftesbury in the Second Characters as two 'honest moral men' who were good friends in Rome.'4 It was, in fact, quite commonly believed that Claude, Salvator and the Poussins all lived as neighbours in Rome.'5 10 WILLIAM GILPIN, Op. cit., p.83; JOSEPH STRUTT: A Biographical Dictionary; containing a Historical account of all the Engravers...

It is worth stressing here that Rosa was considered by academically-minded artists such as Reynolds to be not quite respectable. His work was not placed on the highest rungs of the academic hierarchy and his attempts at 'History' painting were considered to be lacking the dignity and true nobility of the Grand Style. His excellence as a landscape painter, however, was universally accepted; as I mentioned above, he was not normally thought of as a 'History' painter. Apart from the Figurine, Rosa's work was accessible in England from at least the 1770o's in the form of engravings.e6 John Boydell's Catalogue . . . (1779) lists engravings after thirty-five works attributed to Rosa in the United Kingdom. Later Lady Morgan (1824) listed over ioo works attributed to Rosa in the British Isles (Lady Morgan, op. cit., Vol.II, pp.365-7i). In the first half of the century, Rosa seems to have been known best as a landscape painter, indeed almost exclusively so, but engravings after some of his subject and history pictures were produced increasingly from the middle years of the century. This tallies with the fact that the moral content of his art, and the macabre subject-matter of some of his paintings, became better known in the second half of the century, and the romantic qualities of his art were seen not only in the 'savage' landscapes, but also in works such as Saul and the Witch of Endor, which was not etched by Rosa but was first engraved by A. Laurentius, c.I1744/5. Admittedly this picture would have been known, if only by description, to the readers of the Richardsons, but it was probably only after the engraving appeared that the composition with all its 'horror and witchery' became widely known. It is difficult to get a clear picture of how far Rosa's work was known. It seems likely that to a knowledgeable few, such as Mortimer and Reynolds, Rosa's many facets were appreciated, whilst to the majority of artists and writers only the landscape side of Rosa's art was known. Rosa's Satires also, though only in the original Italian, were more often republished in the last thirty years of the eighteenth century.'8 Thus a more rounded though still not wholly accurate, picture of Rosa's life and art was available at the end of the eighteenth century in England than at the beginning. Who is to say, however, that our own picture of Rosa is the final one? No doubt we reveal the preoccupations of our own age just as transparently in our judgement of the past. After the publication of Lady Morgan's biography, interest in Rosa moved even further away from the work itself and increasingly centred on incidents from his 'ro- mantic' life. Francis Haskell has shown that this interest in anecdotes from artists' lives was widespread in the nine- teenth century19 and Rosa was only one artist among many. The personal and domestic lives of great men was of great appeal to the Romantic temperament. During the 1830's and I840's in the Royal Academy exhibitions and carrying on into the I870's in the Paris Salon exhibitions, there were a number of paintings which illustrated incidents from Rosa's life, most of which were drawn from the pages of Lady Morgan. A favourite one was the story of Rosa's alleged stay among the Brigands of the Abruzzi mountains. A lithograph after a painting by Adrien Guignet, Salvator Rosa chez les brigands, is reproduced in the Album du Salon of I844.20 Daniel Maclise, in England, exhibited two paintings of events from Rosa's life, Salvator Rosa and his Patron, at the British Institution in I835 (138), and Salvator painting his friend Masaniello, at the Royal Academy in 1838 (13i7). Both paintings are lost, but an engraving and related drawing (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) for Salvator and his Patron exist (see Hayward Gallery exhibition, No.I49). The two Maclise paintings both illustrate incidents described in Lady Morgan's biography 'and the incidents, as far as is known, are apocryphal. These many genre pictures, which were of a sentimental and anecdotal quality as far as we know, were probably not influenced by Rosa's own style to any extent. They could just as well have been incidents from the life of Raphael or Michelangelo or Titian. The prolifera- tion of illustrations to Rosa's life thus saw the end of his influence as an artist. A parallel can be drawn between the influence of Rosa in art and the influence of the 'Picturesque' in art and land- scape theory. The two are closely connected, as Picturesque theorists inevitably discussed the art of Rosa, placing it on the 'sublime' side of the picturesque spectrum. William Gilpin's own drawing style was partly based on his know- ledge of Rosa's work, and it is interesting that there is a drawing in pen and wash (Collection, Mr D. P. Clifford) by Captain John Bernard Gilpin, William Gilpin's father and teacher, which is a copy after a 'Rosa' landscape at Chats- worth, which was engraved by Joseph Goupy and George Lambert. There was a schematic quality in both Picturesque landscape and the Salvatorial 'sublime' which tended to reduce art to a formula, and an easily learnt one at that. It was, ultimately, too easy to invoke the name of Salvator Rosa in relation to rugged and wild landscapes, just as it is today too easy to invoke the name of Freud in connection with the subconscious. 'Salvator Rosa' was a neat label, but it lacked depth and it was too loosely applied. Thus it could not satisfy the demands of the fully Romantic temperament, just as the Picturesque did not satisfy Wordsworth. In book XII of The Prelude he writes of the Picturesque: '.. . For this Although a strong infection of the age, Was never much my habit - giving way To a comparison of scene with scene, Bent overmuch on superficial things, Pampering myself with meagre novelties Of colour and proportion.' 16 See PETER TOMORY: Salvator Rosa.

The fully Romantic artist such as Turner saw nature as beyond, above and outside the grasp of man. Lastly, a very brief postscript on Ruskin's interpretation of Rosa. Whereas the late eighteenth-century Romantic saw Rosa in terms essentially of the individual struggling against society and echoing in his character the harshness of the elements, Ruskin saw Rosa, certainly as an artist at war, but as engaged in a more cosmic and overwhelmingly ethical battle against the luxuries and materialism of his age. There are the seeds of this interpretation in Lady Morgan, but Ruskin developed them and stated it more completely in moral terms. He linked Rosa with Diurer in this fight for spirituality, though he saw in Rosa the spirituality of the condemned man. 'All succeeding men, however powerful - Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck, Reynolds - would have mocked at the idea of a spirit. They were men of the world; they are never in earnest, and they are never appalled. But Salvator was capable of pensiveness, of faith, and of fear. The misery of the earth is a marvel to him; he cannot leave off gazing at it. The religion of the earth is a horror to him. He gnashes his teeth at it, rages at it, mocks and gibes at it. He would have acknowledged religion, had he seen any that was true.'22 21 See MANWARING, Fp. cit., p.120. 22 JOHN RUSKIN: Modern Painters, Vol.V, Part IX, Of Ideas of Relation: Second, of Invention Spiritual, Chapter IV, Diirer and Salvator.
