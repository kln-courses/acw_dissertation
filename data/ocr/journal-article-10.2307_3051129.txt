Pp. xvii + 314; 1 color ill., 98 black-and-white ills. $55 Written by the dean of scholars of Central African ethnography and art, these two books are the first to appear in a series of five volumes. Daniel Biebuyck's long-awaited and ambitious en- deavor integrates ethnographic data with iconographic materials in an exploration of traditional African sculpture. General sur- veys and exhibition catalogues in this field have been notorious for their neglect of the cultural framework within which the art operates. Knowledge of its function and meaning has been su- perficial and imprecise, reflected in the mere labeling of given objects as ritualistic, ancestral, or fetishistic. Even in more spe- cialized studies, stylistic distribution and formal relationships have often become a preoccupation to the exclusion of the complexities of how the objects were used and how they communicated mean- ing. It is Biebuyck's purpose to correct this deficiency. Although it is devoted to the Southwestern region, the first volume of The Arts of Zaire begins with a general, critical eval- uation of the sources and evidence for the study of Central Af- rican art. Here the author reviews the history of ethnographic and art research and examines their interpretive methods. As such, this is an essential preface for the other volumes of the series. Biebuyck's scholarly rigor together with his personal involve- ment, stemming from the circle of Frans Olbrecht at Ghent Uni- versity in the 1940s, give him a unique perspective. His familiar- ity, moreover, with pertinent material in district and province archives in Zaire as well as with Belgian government records sup- plies a mine of little-known information. The volume on the Southwestern region treats thirty-four eth- nic groups, bounded in the north by the lower Kasai, Kwango, and Kwilu Rivers; on the west by the middle and upper Kwango; and on the east by the middle Kwilu and Kasai divides. Most peoples of the Kongo cluster and Teke-related groups are excluded here in order to be incorporated in a future volume. As might be expected in a study of the Southwestern region, the traditional settings of the Yaka, Pende, Mbala, Holo, Yansi, and Hungaan and their art are prominently reviewed. The surprise inclusion in the volume is the host of ethnic groups unfamiliar to most con- noisseurs of African art - identified as the Wuum, Bolia, Sengele, Sakata, Buma, Dzing, Tsong, Mbun, Pindi, Tsaam, Dikidiki, Mbeko, and Mbinsa, to name but a few. This attention to lesser- known peoples presents a wider scope and restores order to a mass of collected objects, even though many of the documented ex- amples are rough and crude in their execution. Clearly, the au- thor's interest is in the art object as cultural artifact rather than in an evaluative selection of masterworks within a corpus of ob- jects. As Biebuyck notes at the end of Volume One (p. 252), it will remain nearly impossible to determine the artistic originality of many of these small ethnic units because of the sparse evidence and unknown collection data. I might add that, because of the territorial fragmentation and historic mixing of many of these small groups with other ethnic components, the usefulness of some of the author's precise classifications would appear limited. Part Two presents an ethnographic overview of the Southwest region that expands previous ethnographic summaries, including that published by Vansina, et al., in 1966.1 Languages spoken, territorial intermingling of peoples, economic subsistence, and broad similarities in political organization and initiation systems are reviewed, as well as body adornment, insignia of rank and status, weaponry, and oral literature. Part Three begins with a summary of the various classifications of sculpture styles for the Southwestern region. The influential categories and subdivisions offered by Olbrecht's classic study2 are treated, as are the later nuances of classification that were proposed by Maesen, Burssens, and Cornet in various exhibition catalogues and other publications. On this base, Biebuyck then proceeds to delineate the spectrum of functional categories and conceptual frameworks, on a cross-ethnic level. Initiation rites, consecrations of chiefs and other dignitaries, therapeutic and pro- tective cults, diviners and ritual specialists: each manifests the historical, economic, sociopolitical, educational, recreational, and psychological functions of art. Then follows a detailed list of gen- res that enumerates the varieties of anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic masks and statuettes and includes as well decorated mus- ical instruments, staffs, weapons, ornaments, household furnishings, and architectural embellishments. Finally, each in- dividual ethnic unit is discussed in one of seven geographical groupings: for example, peoples on the right bank of the lower Kasai-Lake Maindombe divide, peoples on the right bank of the lower Kasai between the lower Inzia and lower Loange, and so forth. Individual sections begin with the ethnography of a given group, then proceed to the institutional settings where masks and figures are involved, and conclude with objects assigned to an "other" category, all discussions replete with bibliographic ref- 1 J.

In the face of scattered published sources as well as un- evenness, contradictions, and gaps in reporting, the author has masterfully integrated valuable data into a broad cultural frame- work for specific objects or groups of objects. Because the socio- ritual contexts of many of these societies have been greatly altered or have even ceased to exist in recent years, the reconstruction of traditional contexts at the turn of this century has necessitated archival rather than "field" investigation. Surprisingly, there are no maps to guide the uninitiated through the complexities of rivers or ethnic areas. This volume requires the constant use of supplementary materials for reference, for which I would recommend Olga Boone's Carte ethnique du Congo: Quart Sud-Est.3 Moreover, the hundred black-and-white illustrations pertain to only a few of the examples discussed. Nu- merous references are made to art objects published elsewhere in order to broaden the visual range of this study, but, unfortu- nately, the citations are often to illustrations in rare and long-out- of-print publications available in the United States through only a few libraries. A greater number of illustrations would seem more appropriate for the scope of this work. Biebuyck's entries for individual objects include the size of the object, its provenance, the collector (if known), and references to previously published sources. Illustrated examples derive from the oldest documented collections in major European museums, at Tervuren, Hamburg, Antwerp, Amsterdam, and Leiden. Al- though the author is careful to qualify the provenances of some objects with such phrases as "and ascribed by him to the .. .," still other objects (e.g., ills. 60, 61, and 68) are uncritically given an ethnic provenance with no direct documentation. Further- more, a few sculptures are presented as "collected by Van Wing among the Yaka" (ills. 37, 41, 43, 46, 47) with little indication that an older generic usage of this name may include several ethnic components now designated as separate. This same problem exists in the provenance, for example, of ill. 41, given as "Gingengi- Lukula." This was a trade center on the Lukula River, in the 1920s, with a mixed population of Suku and Mbala (while the object itself, a mask, is clearly northern Suku in style). Despite the au- thoritative tone and comprehensive coverage of this first volume, there remains a need for continued critical analysis of the existing documentation in conjunction with comparative attribution and stylistic analysis. Volume ii, dedicated to the arts of Eastern Zaire, is strikingly different in scope. Focus here is placed on a single social insti- tution, the Lega bwami association, as a unitive factor for treating the entire region. In Part One, Biebuyck explores the use of art objects in ritual performances by the top two grades of the Lega bwami, along with the known history, structure, and ideology of this organization. Aphorisms, variously sung, murmured, whis- pered, or tonally produced on musical instruments, are the pri- mary exegetical documents employed for the understanding of initiation-related objects. The variety of objects in this context ranges from miniature sculptured masks and figures to spoons, billhooks, knives, ax blades, and natural objects, including skulls, carapaces, claws, beaks, feathers, and leaves. The forms, materials, terminology, ownership, transfer, and the contexts for the presentation of anthropomorphic figurines are treated in Part Two, where the author is, I think, at his best. The names of the figurines bring to life specific good or evil char- acters as defined by the bwami association, although the author stresses the arbitrary relationship here between the verbal and iconographic features. He cites examples where identical mean- ings are conveyed by heterogeneous forms, and he points out that a single type of object is not necessarily limited to one set of mean- ings - largely because of differences in the contexts of usage. Lega figurines function as initiation devices and help convey a system of moral, social, and legal teachings that is expressed in the bwami association's displays and dramatic performances. Works of art are not meant to be understood by outsiders, but rather serve as a secret script or as mnemonic devices that aid in memorizing an enormous number of proverbs and ritual actions. Multiple levels of meaning within a given example may signify advancement in bwami grades, prestige, social integration, and remedy against sickness as well as group continuity. Within these complexities, perhaps few scholars other than Biebuyck could so patiently unravel the intentionally cryptic nature of the art. Part Three is dedicated to zoomorphic figurines, which, like the human figurines, are personified characters with significant habits and physical features. Pangolins, chameleons, antelopes, frogs, snakes, elephants, and birds are among the large variety discussed. The Lega, like their Nyanga and Komo neighbors, are passionate hunters with firsthand knowledge of animal behavior, and virtually all types interest bwami initiates, not just those which are otherwise ritually significant. And yet the author points out that, in addition to the identifiable characters, there are gener- alized four-legged figurines that can stand for as many as three different animals; and there are animals represented by a few light wood sticks tied together or even by an anthropomorphic figurine hung upside down. In Part Four, the masks of Central and South Legaland are treated in five major types, again with the relevant terminology, ownership, acquisition, manner of keeping, function, use, and meaning both within and outside initiation contexts. Made of wood, bone, ivory, or molded in copal, masks range from min- iature versions with whitened faces and fiber beards to large face masks that are not worn but kept in collectively owned baskets, affixed to fences, or placed on symbolic graves. Maskettes refer to the skulls of forebears as givers of life and persons of authority. Larger masks represent lineages that introduced certain rites; they validate seniority claims and signify solidarity for those under- going the same initiation. A miscellany of Lega sculpture types, varying from phallic sculptures to spoons, are described in Part Five along with their use in dramatic performances and their multiple levels of meaning in related aphorisms. For example, phallic sculpture often signifies the complex character Yanga and can be symbolically replaced by other items like torches, bark beaters, or the motif of pointed stripes. In presentation, the object can be simply shown, held against the pubic area, manipulated in a suggestive manner, or held against a miniature canoe or perforated mussel shell, or used to beat a slit-drum. Miniature versions of phallic sculptures serve as emblems of virile status of kanyamwa women and are worn by them attached to a belt. In Part Six, entitled "Bwami Traditions," Biebuyck presents re- gional differences in bwami practices among various Lega subgroups, and he summarizes their historical traditions. Bwami and analogous voluntary associations and chief's initiations, found among neighbors of the Lega, are viewed as regional variations of common ancestral institutions developed during the migration of Lega-related peoples - but modified by the ritual of pre- established Pygmy populations. This second volume thus presents a welcome amplification and a broader perspective than Biebuyck's previous work, Lega Cul- ture, published in 1973. The eighty-four illustrated art objects, each with extensive notation, are with two exceptions previously unpublished. Yet nothing is illustrated of the art of the Bembe, 3Tervuren, 1961.</page><page sequence="3">364 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1988 VOLUME LXX NUMBER 2 Nyanga, Mbole, Mitoko, Lengola, and other neighboring peo- ples, nor again are any maps provided. To be sure, the author's previous writings on the arts of Eastern Zaire, in the journal Af- rican Arts and elsewhere,4 included maps and numerous other illustrations; and these articles must, I think, still be consulted to supplement the present volume. Biebuyck's conceptual interest in the flexibility of usage and the multiplicity of meanings that can be attached to works of art is obvious in each volume, and it serves especially well when con- flicting data from various researchers must be reconciled. The integration of art objects with music, drama, oral literature, and with other man-made objects is significant for the exploration of the social motivations, values, and thought systems that underlie artistic production. On the other hand, the author steers clear of treating the changes that have taken place, since the 1880s, in the conventional forms, design, and stylistic variations of this art. Both volumes of The Arts of Zaire are summations of the state of research on the art of Central Africa up to the 1980s. But as an anthropologist, Biebuyck is far from staking sole claim to interpretation of the material. He calls rather for more interdis- ciplinary studies, for small-scale comprehensive monographs and analyses of limited topics - whether based on further field studies or archival research. He urges further study of adornment, ar- chitecture, furniture, graphics, and gesture as well as the equally important interrelationships between artwork and oral literature, dance, song, and the ambiance of display. Although at times Biebuyck's work makes uncompromising de- mands on the reader, its primacy in the serious study of these regions is beyond question. His volumes will remain a standard authority on the traditional art of Zaire. ARTHUR P.
