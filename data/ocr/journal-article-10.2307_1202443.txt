<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hypothesized God of C. S. Peirce and William James Gary Alexander / University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point It is clear that Charles Peirce, who initiated the idea, and William James, who founded the movement, differed about the meaning of pragmatism, a fact that Peirce recognized in announcing "the birth of the word 'pragmaticism,' which is ugly enough to be safe from kid- nappers."' Peirce had originally intended to establish a method of clar- ifying ideas by asking us to "consider what effects, that might conceiv- ably have practical bearing, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our concep- tion of the object" (5.2). In his numerous expressions of this pragmatic maxim, Peirce consistently maintains that these "effects" cannot be limited to the ideas and actions of the individual. Rather, he under- stands them to entail an interpretation of experience that denies abso- lute individuality and assumes truth to be independent of subjectivity. Furthermore, despite the implications of his philosophy for a theory of truth, Peirce adamantly maintained that pragmatism is a philosophical method rather than either a worldview or a theory of truth. James interpreted pragmatism "more broadly" than did Peirce, pre- ferring "to express Peirce's principle by saying that the effective mean- ing of any philosophical proposition can always be brought down to some particular consequence, in our future practical experience, whether active or passive; the point laying rather in the fact that the 1 Charles S.

His pragmatism reflects his psychology of the conscious self, wherein the individual must make decisions in the short run of a single life regarding the truth or falsity of specific propositions and beliefs. Here, in associating pragmatism with truth and truth with the individual, James's philosophy diverges greatly from Peirce's original intention. Peirce notes this difference in observing that James "defines prag- matism as the doctrine that the whole 'meaning' of a concept expresses itself either in the shape of conduct to be recommended or of experience to be expected. Between this definition and mine there certainly appears to be no slight theoretical divergence, which, for the most part, becomes evanescent in practice; and though we may differ on impor- tant questions of philosophy-especially as regards the infinite and the absolute -I am inclined to think that the discrepancies reside in other than the pragmatistic ingredients of our thought" (5.466). Perhaps Peirce is correct in maintaining that the differences between their two positions vanish in practice, but the theoretical distinctions are none- theless substantial enough that he prefers to rename his position in an attempt to distinguish it from those of James and other pragmatists. Their respective interpretations of God provide a good example of the similarities and differences between James's and Peirce's pragmat- isms. On the one hand, both men understand "God" to be a hypothesis, subject to Peirce's methodological dictum that reasoning can never pro- vide "absolute certainty, absolute exactitude, absolute universality." In fact, "we cannot be absolutely certain that our conclusions are even approximately true" (1.141). This is Peirce's "fallibilism," and it is central to both his and James's efforts to make sense of religion in light of the discoveries of modern science. Both philosophers took the posi- tion that while science, per se, is not hostile to the religious enterprise, the scientist's fallibilistic attitude makes it impossible for any single reli- gious tradition to present its dogmas as being absolutely certain. Since pragmaticism/pragmatism presupposes this attitude, it is requisite that any philosophy of religion developed on this basis recognize the fallible nature of dogma. Not even God, as we will see, escapes this methodo- logical requirement. The psychologist, James, argues that God "is real since he produces real effects" that are "exerted on the personal centres of energy of the 2 William James, "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results," in Collected Essays and Reviews (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1969), p. 412. 305</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion various subjects."3 This deity may be finite, he claims, as long as it is larger than the sphere of human consciousness, looks favorably on indi- vidual ambitions and efforts, and promotes strenuous ethical action. James believes that human beings most need a sympathetic God, one who supports the individual's efforts to fashion a meaningful life. Still, he does not reduce God to a set of psychological categories, arguing that "there are religious experiences of a specific nature, not deducible by analogy or psychological reasoning from our other sorts of experi- ence. I think that they point with reasonable probability to the contin- uity of our consciousness with a wider spiritual environment from which the ordinary prudential man (who is the only man that scientific psychology, so called, takes cognizance of) is shut off."4 Still, James does maintain that, in order to be experienced as a real aspect of human experience, this deity must be understood and interpreted in terms of the individual consciousness and will. Peirce rejects this psychological approach, arguing that God is a demonstrable element of the universe and is experienced by individuals but that the deity's reality is not dependent on individual experience. His theism rests on a pragmaticism that presupposes a universe that continually develops (synechism) in terms of three fundamental cate- gories: "firstness," or purely qualitative possibility; "secondness," or encounter; and "thirdness," or law. As we will see, Peirce runs the risk of pantheism in developing his theism on the basis of these categories. Nonetheless, he believed his position to be consistent with Christian theism, despite the fact that he remained relatively indifferent to the traditional attributes assigned to God by theologians. One indication of his efforts to remain with a traditional Christian framework is his strong disagreement with James's belief in the sufficiency of a finite God. This appreciation for traditional Christian theism notwithstanding, Peirce shared with James a rather negative opinion of theology. In his view, the "backward condition" of metaphysics could be attributed to the fact "that its leading professors have been theologians" (6.3). What is more, he charged that "the ideas of theologians always appreciably differ from those of the universal church. They swamp religion in fal- lacious logical disputations," which results in "the continual drawing tighter and tighter of the narrowing bounds of doctrine, with less and less attention to the living essence of religion." Finally, he complains, matters reach the point where it is declared "that the salvation of each 3 William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, in The Works of William James (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), p. 407. 4 William James, A Pluralistic Universe, in The Works of WilliamJames (1977), p. 135. 306</page><page sequence="4">The Hypothesized God of Peirce andJames individual absolutely and almost exclusively depends upon his enter- taining a correct metaphysics of the godhead." At this point "the vital spark of inspiration becomes finally quite extinct" (6.438). James, in similar fashion, presumed that many of the definitions and attributes of God advanced by theologians "have absolutely nothing to do with religion, for religion is a living practical affair." Theological discussions of these attributes "have the trail of the serpent over them as the books on theology have actually worked them out. One feels that, in the theologians' hands, they are only a set of dictionary adjectives, mechanically deduced; logic has stepped into the place of vision, pro- fessionalism into that of life."5 Religion, he claims, is kept alive by "something else than abstract definitions and systems of concatenated adjectives, and something different from faculties of theology and their professors." Definitions and the theological systems that are erected on them are merely "aftereffects, secondary accretions upon those phe- nomena of vital conversation with the unseen divine... [that occur] in the lives of humble private men."6 These harsh judgments of theology reflect the fact that both Peirce and James consider religion to be primarily a matter of lived experi- ence, rather than affirmation of strictly defined doctrine. James's classic definition is that "religion . .shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they appre- hend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." He adds two important qualifications to this definition, accept- ing as divine any "godlike" object, "whether it be a concrete deity or not," and demanding that this object be responded to "solemnly and gravely."7 This latter requirement recognizes that some individuals devote their lives completely to trivial things, and James refused to include total commitment to trivia within his definition of religion. By far the most important element of his definition, however, is the assumption that reason "would never have inferred... specifically reli- gious experiences in advance of their actual coming." That is to say, "reason, working in abstraction from specifically religious experiences, will always omit something." It is only "from the facts of experience," for example, that reason can "infer" the reality of a God.8 Peirce agreed that there is "in each individual... a sort of sentiment, or obscure perception, a deep recognition of a something in the cir- cumambient All.... But religion cannot reside in its totality in a single 5 James, "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results," pp. 426-27. 6 James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 352. 7 Ibid., pp. 34, 36, 39. 8 William James, "Reason and Faith," in Essays in Religion and Morality, in The Works of William James (1982), pp. 128, 124. 307</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion individual. Like every species of reality, it is essentially a social, a public affair" (6.429). He thus goes beyond James's more privatized definition to argue that the essence of religion is social. However, he agrees with James that if it is to make sense, religion must be grounded in individual experience. Peirce's emphasis on the social dimension of religion is reflected in his willingness to remain associated with the Christian tradition. Unlike James, who wrote in 1904 that he had vir- tually outgrown Christianity,9 Peirce asserted that Christianity repre- sents the epitome of religion when it is defined not as "mere belief," but as "a life...a living belief-a thing to be lived rather than said or thought" (6.439). Keeping these different views of religion in mind, let us turn now to an examination of Peirce's and James's analyses of God. I do not attempt in what follows to present a chronological interpretation of either man's theism.10 Rather, I offer an overview of their respective theisms, with an eye to discerning how they differ in light of their respective interpretations of pragmatism. Of particular interest is the fact that each develops a philosophical position that rejects the notion of a God who can be known with absolute certainty. In so doing, they introduce a tension that is unresolved in either Peirce's pragmaticism or James's pragmatism, that is, between their personal belief in some sort of Christian God and a theoretical position that makes belief in God an individual option that is not absolutely necessary to an adequate interpretation of the universe. JAMES S FINITE GOD William James's personal belief about God was clear. In a 1904 letter to James Leuba, he admits to having "no living sense of commerce with a God. I envy those who have, for I know the addition of such a sense would help me immensely. The Divine, for my active life, is limited to abstract concepts."1 We find a more extended personal statement in his response to a questionnaire sent him by James Bissett Pratt in the fall of 1904.12 Asked what religion means to him personally, whether it is "a belief that something exists,"James replies "yes." He describes it as "a social reality" that functions for him as "the social appeal for 9 Henry James, ed., The Letters of William James, 2 vols.

James, ed., 2:212-15. 308</page><page sequence="6">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James corroboration, consolation, etc., when things are going wrong with my causes (my truth denied, etc.)." When Pratt asks what he means by God, James replies that it is "a combination of ideality and (final) efficacity." On the question of whether God is a person, he states that "he must be cognizant and responsive in some way." Asked why he believes in God, whether it is as a result of some argument, the philosopher replies "emphatically, no." He indicates acceptance of the authority of the "whole tradition of religious people, to which something in me makes admiring response" but rejects the authority of either the Bible or any individual. Finally, he asserts that he believes in God "because I need it so that it 'must' be true." In a statement that reflects his acceptance of a finite deity and which verges on polytheism, James asserts that "'God,' to me, is not the only spiritual reality to believe in. Religion means primarily a universe of spiritual relations surrounding the earthly practical ones, not merely relations of 'value,' but agencies and their activities." James's personal God, as characterized in this response to Pratt, is thus vaguely a person, and yet it is but one among the multiple spiritual realities in which human beings believe. James, by his own admission, has no real sense of communication with such a God. In his more systematic reflections, James speaks of God in essentially four different ways. First, he characterizes God as the finite limit of the field of consciousness. Describing the stream of thought as a succession of conscious fields, he observes that "every definite image in the mind" exists amid "the sense of its relations near and remote, the dying echo of whence it came to us, the dawning sense of whither it is to lead. The significance, the value, of the image is all in this halo... that surrounds and escorts it."13 In The Varieties of Religious Experience, this field of con- sciousness is said to include a subconscious religion through which a God might possibly communicate with an individual, that is, "whatever it may be on its farther side, the 'more' with which in religious experi- ence we feel ourselves connected is on its hither side the subconscious continuation of our conscious life."14 A second use to which James puts "God" is ethical. Here the deity functions to excite the "strenuous mood," James's central ethical cate- gory. This is the attitude that causes us, for example, to forgo present pleasure for the future attainment of an ideal goal or to sacrifice per- sonal pleasure on behalf of an ethical principle. James considered belief 13 William James, The Principles of Psychology, 2 vols., in The Works of William James (1981), 1:246. 14 James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (n. 3 above), p. 403. 309</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion in God to provide the strongest possible motive for such activity. While he was well aware that ethics can be justified on nontheistic grounds, he still considered belief in God to be the superior inducement to strenuous ethical action. In fact, he argued, "even if there were no metaphysical or traditional grounds for believing in a God, men would postulate one simply as a pretext for living hard."'5 A third and related interpretation of "God" is found in The Principles of Psychology, where the deity is discussed in terms of an "ideal social self." James has described the "empirical self" as hierarchical, consist- ing of a material, social, and spiritual dimension.'6 The first consists of those things that belong to the individual, such as clothing, home, and, in a sense, one's immediate family. The social self is the varied recog- nition that we receive from others, while the spiritual self is our "inner or subjective being," that most intimate part of the self that is "felt" by the individual and that is concretely experienced in the fullest sense of the term. Each of these selves includes both immediately actual and remotely potential elements. James argues that the "potential social self is the most interesting" of the potential selves since it causes us to act in ways not immediately understandable or acceptable to others. In particular, it enables us to go against the crowd in acting on matters of principle. When we find ourselves in situations where our actions or beliefs are not acceptable to, or not understood by, those whom we respect, then we may be "inwardly strengthened...and steeled against the loss of [the] actual social self by the thought of other and better possible social judges than those whose verdict goes against [us] now." This "ideal social self" is one "that is at least worthy of approving recognition by the highest possible judging companion, if such companion there be. This self is the true, the intimate, the ultimate, the permanent Me that I seek. This judge is God, the Absolute Mind, the 'great Companion."' This ideal aspect of the self is associated with the "sense of an ideal spectator," says James, by those who "are possibly the most religious" individuals. 17 Finally, in an essay on "Reflex Action and Theism,"James describes God in terms of his conception of mind as a "triadic structure of impres- sion, reflection, and reaction." Rather than address the issue of the actual existence of God, he argues that this is 15 William James, "The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life," in The Will to Believe, in The Works of William James (n. 3 above, 1979), p. 161. 16 James, The Principles of Psychology, 1:279-92. 17 Ibid., pp. 300-301. 310</page><page sequence="8">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James at all events the kind of being which, if he did exist, would form the most ade- quate possible object for minds framed like our own to conceive as lying at the root of the universe. My thesis, in other words, is this: that some outward reality of a nature defined as God's nature must be defined, is the only ultimate object that is at the same time rational and possible for the human mind's contemplation.... Theism, whatever its objective warrant, would thus be seen to have a subjective anchorage in its congruity with our nature as thinkers; and, however it may fare with its truth, to derive from this subjective ade- quacy the strongest possible guaranty of its permanence.'8 While James believes that such a deity must be "conceived as the deepest power in the universe" and "under the form of a mental person- ality," he rejects the idea of God as an absolute.19 "If," he asserts, "it should prove probable that the absolute does not exist, it will not follow in the slightest degree that a god like that of David, Isaiah, or Jesus may not exist."20 The only requirement is that God be conceived as external to the individual personality, that is, "all that the facts require is that the power should be both other and larger than our conscious selves.... It need not be infinite, it need not be solitary."21 Given this assumption of otherness, the divine and human personalities are similar "at least in this-that both have purposes for which they care, and each can hear the other's call."22 James's God thus represents an ideal limit that is conceived along the lines of the rational structure of human thought. His God is a moral force that induces individuals to choose the most strenuous and prin- cipled action possible in situations where they are called on to act ethic- ally. It is a God that may or may not exist but in which belief can make a significant difference in the way a person interprets the meaning of existence. Such a God is a reasonable hypothesis based on what we know of the human mind, that is, belief in God is rational in light of the structure of consciousness and the assumption that there are purposive tendencies in the natural order in which that consciousness participates. Individuals, acting on the basis of their beliefs, contribute to the evolv- ing reality of the universe. Therefore, belief in God is both reasonable and useful. Nonetheless, James does not demand that a pragmatist adopt his theism. He is well aware that his arguments for a finite God imply polytheism, observing that "the original polytheism of mankind has only imperfectly and vaguely sublimated itself into monotheism, and 18 William James, "Reflex Action and Theism," in The Will to Believe, pp. 93-94. 19 Ibid., p. 97. 20 James, A Pluralistic Universe (n. 4 above), p. 54. 21 James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 413. 22 James, "Reflex Action and Theism," p. 98. 311</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion monotheism itself, so far as it was religious and not a scheme of class- room instruction for the metaphysicians, has always viewed God as but one helper, primus inter pares, in the midst of all the shapers of the great world's fate." He proposes simply that "if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true."23 That is as far as he takes the question, since it is possible to account for the world without having recourse to the theistic hypothesis. In short, there can be no doubt of James's own belief in the reality of God, but it remains the case that his pragmatism does not require that there actually be such a deity. While he believes that the theistic posi- tion provides the soundest basis for the most strenuous ethical activity, James's philosophy does not require that such a deity be present either in order for the universe to make sense or for ethical activity to be induced. We can be human and moral whether there is a God or not. Without God, however, James thinks that we will not be as moral as we possibly can be. This is an important point for him, since he presumes that "we all help to determine the content of ethical philosophy so far as we contribute to the race's moral life."24 His primary concern is the effect that belief in God has on the individual's willingness actively to engage life and to contribute to the positive meaning and morality of the whole. In summary, we can say that James's God is psychologically real to the individual and induces that individual to participate most vigorously in the actualizing of life's possibilities but is in no way neces- sary to the explanation of either human life or the cosmos. In this latter position, James's conception is quite different from Peirce's interpreta- tion of experience and God. PEIRCE S PHILOSOPHICAL DEITY Like James, Peirce considers theism to be hypothetical, thus remaining consistent with his fallibilistic attitude toward all knowledge. At the same time, he seems to have considered this deity to be a necessary ele- ment of a universe interpreted in light of his categories and his synechism. Donna Orange, in her excellent study of his theism, notes that "it seems undeniable that Peirce himself thought God, under var- ious names, was a conception required by the rest of his philosophical views. His pragmatism and theory of inquiry required an ideal truth. His synechism needed a continuum to include all continua. His norma- tive sciences wanted the summum bonum, and his evolutionist cosmology, he believed, required the double Absolute, the Alpha and Omega. 23 William James, Pragmatism, in The Works of William James (1975), p. 143. 24 James, "The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life" (n. 15 above), p. 141. 312</page><page sequence="10">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James Each of these-the ideal truth, the Absolute, the summum bonum, and even the continuum-was a philosophical description of the God of religious experience and of worship."25 Whereas James's conception of God is always linked to his psychology of the individual consciousness and is not required by pragmatism, Peirce's deity is integral to his overall pragmaticism philosophical position. Peirce believed that God, variously described, is necessary in order to account for the character of the universe as human beings experience and interpret it. And, in opposition to James, he declares that "the God of my theism is not finite. That won't do at all.... A finite being... is one of a genus; so that it would, to my mind, involve polytheism" (8.262). Still, like James, he rejects traditional theism in favor of his own interpretation, one which he presents in various ways. In a statement that he claims "is essentially that of Christian the- ology" (1.362, n. 1), Peirce describes God in terms of his three cate- gories: "the starting point of the universe, God the Creator, is the Absolute First; the terminus of the universe, God, completely revealed, is the Absolute Second; every state of the universe at a measurable point of time is the third." Further, he states that "if your creed is that the whole universe is approaching in the infinitely distant future a state having a general character different from that toward which we look back in the infinitely distant past, you make the absolute consist in two distinct real points and are an evolutionist" (1.362). This view, in Peirce's opinion, is completely consistent with traditional Christian trinitarianism, while still allowing for an understanding of the universe as evolving. Since he considers human reason the key to our ability to understand this God, Peirce thinks it fully justifiable to conceive of the deity in anthropomorphic terms. He has noted that it is impossible to grasp the conception of an absolute first or absolute second, and there "is no absolute third, for the third is of its own nature relative" (1.362). The God available to human reason must thus be understood as related to that reason and be interpreted in terms that express our ability to grasp its nature. "To believe in a god at all," asks Peirce, "is not that to believe that man's reason is allied to the originating principle of the universe?" (2.24). In a more dramatic vein, he asserts that "there is a degree of baseness in denying our birthright as children of God and in shame- facedly slinking away from an anthropomorphic conception of the universe" (1.316). At other times, Peirce refers to God in aesthetic terms, arguing that "the very meaning of the word 'God' implies. . . aesthetic spiritual per- 25 Orange, p. 87. 313</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion fection" (6.510). The only evidence for "the existence of a governor of the universe" that he finds plausible is the lawful character of that uni- verse. In particular, the "character of those laws themselves," which he describes as "benevolent, beautiful, economical, etc.," leads Peirce to assert the presence of God within the developing cosmos (6.395). He finds this development to be guided by an agapastic principle that itself can be associated with God. Agapasm, or evolutionary love, achieves "the good result..., first, by the bestowal of spontaneous energy by the parent upon the offspring, and, second, by the disposition of the latter to catch the general idea of those about it and thus to subserve the gen- eral purpose" (6.303). The advance of creation depends in part on the responsiveness of the created. By using such terminology, Peirce makes it clear that he associates agapasm with the Christian God, whose nature he finds to be lovingly expressed in the developing universe. Peirce associates agapasm with "self-control," a concept similar to James's "strenuous mood" in being "the capacity for rising to an extended view of a practical subject instead of seeing only temporary urgency" (5.339, n. 1). Both within the individual and in the lawful universe as a whole, there operates a principle of love (agapasm) that strives to take into consideration the widest expanse of possibility in pursuing and concretizing particular purposes. Self-control and pur- pose thus go hand in hand and contribute substantially to Peirce's interpretation of God. In fact, he says, I think that the existence of God, as well as we can conceive of it, consists in this, that a tendency toward ends is so necessary a constituent of the universe that the mere action of chance upon innumerable atoms has an inevitable tele- ological result. One of the ends so brought about is the development of intelli- gence and of knowledge; and therefore I should say that God's omniscience, humanly conceived, consists in the fact that knowledge in its development leaves no question unanswered. The scepticism just spoken of would admit this omniscience as a regulative but not a speculative conception (8.44). This regulative, agapastic ideal presses toward an "advance" that "takes place by virtue of a positive sympathy among the created spring- ing from the continuity of mind" (6.304). Unlike James, Peirce doubts that any great achievements could be produced strictly by the individ- ual, and his agapasm accounts for the necessity of the social. Both the individual and religion are, he argues, essentially social dimensions of experience. The important thing is that we be aiming always at a deter- mination of the truth, despite the fact that we can never be certain we have obtained it. This, however, is sufficient if we are satisfied "that investigation has a universal tendency toward the settlement of opinion" (8.43). This faith contributes to our sense that the universe develops in 314</page><page sequence="12">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James a reasonable manner and, out of its growth, as Orange notes, "God as summum bonum emerges." Orange cites Peirce's comment that "the laws of nature are ideas or resolutions in the mind of some vast conscious- ness, who, whether supreme or subordinate, is a Deity relatively to us" (5.107) and adds the observation that the "process of evolution consists in the fulfillment of these ideas, resolutions, or purposes of the deity's mind."26 Here, then, in the language of evolution, purpose, and love, Peirce describes God in terms of a lawfully developing, aesthetically experienced, universe. Here, too, he displays at least some sympathy with James's finite God in describing the supreme consciousness as being a God in relation to finite consciousness, whether it is "supreme or subordinate." Probably the most well known of Peirce's discussions of God is his "Neglected Argument," which he describes as actually a "nest of three arguments" for God's reality. The first, or "humble argument," is the idea that anyone who freely engages in play, or "musement," about the nature of the universe "will inevitably develop" both an idea of God and "a deep sense of the adorability of that Idea" (6.486). His second argu- ment is the claim that "every heart" will respond to this adorable deity, since it is the "natural" result of "free meditation" and need not be forced by means of rational argumentation. This, he says, is "properly the neglected argument, yet I have sometimes used the abbreviation 'the N.A.' for the whole nest of the three" (6.487). The third of this nest is "a study of logical methodeutic, illuminated by the light of first-hand acquaintance with genuine scientific thought." The student here dis- covers that the "humble argument" is "nothing but an instance of the first stage of all such work, the stage of observing facts, or variously rearranging them, and of pondering them until, by their reactions with the results of previous scientific experience, there is 'evolved'...an explanatory hypothesis" (6.488). However instinctually certain the idea of God may appear to the individual, it remains subject to the fallibilistic attitude of the scientist and pragmaticist. It must constantly be tested in order to determine its status as a truth-claim; it cannot be assumed as an a priori truth that stands without testing. This position, of course, presents Peirce with a problem, since he is strongly convinced of the truth, or at least the necessity, of the theistic hypothesis. Consequently, he claims that the hypothesis of God is different from ordinary hypotheses in three ways. First, he asserts that theism is much more plausible than other types of "deliberately formed hypotheses" since it has "sprung from Muse- 26 Ibid., p. 67. 315</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion ments." It is, he thinks, so powerful an idea that "there is great danger that the investigation will stop at this first stage" (6.488). Second, the God hypothesis is decidedly vague, differing from the normally func- tioning hypothesis by not providing definite mental images. He describes God as a "disembodied spirit" that "probably has no con- sciousness" since consciousness as we experience it "is either merely the general sensation of the brain or some part of it, or at all events some visceral or bodily sensation" (6.489). God must be different from this type of conscious being, although we must not attempt to specify the nature of God's being too clearly. Finally, Peirce argues that the hypothesis of God is unique in influencing the "whole conduct of life of its believers" (6.490). This is the God who is the "super-order" of the universe, a necessary being that is logically connected with the charac- ter of human thought and that consequently has a powerful influence on the nature and direction of that thought. In contrast toJames's more psychological description of God, Peirce describes the deity in terms of his understanding of the logical character of reason as a threefold process of feeling, reaction, and law, that is, the formation of "habit." Peirce's God, we might say, is here the habit of the universe, the law of laws to which he thinks all of us would respond if only we mused freely and playfully. As Orange points out, the significance of this view of God is its hypo- thetical character. "The great advantage of a 'hypothetical' God is to keep the believer intellectually honest. No matter how plausible and attractive a believer may find a religious view of the world, one who holds all beliefs lightly will always be ready to notice a 'surprising fact' which might require the revision or rejection of the believed hypothe- sis."27 We must add to this observation the comment that there is a problem in promoting a God that is both necessary and hypothetical. The serious religious believer is not inclined to hold beliefs "lightly," a fact that Peirce surely recognizes. Nonetheless, he retains within his theory this tension between a necessary infinite being and a hypothet- ical object of belief. In so doing, he stamps his pragmaticist philosophy of religion as thoroughly modern in recognizing that the very idea of God is problematic and, simultaneously, recognizes the importance of the God hypothesis for western humanity. In abandoning traditional theological conceptualizations of God, he is willing to run the risk that faith in God can survive the same type of experimental attitude that motivates the scientist. In fact, it must do so in order to survive as a meaningful reality. 27 Ibid., p. 92. 316</page><page sequence="14">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James Finally, we have Peirce's direct description of the pragmaticist's God: "If a pragmaticist is asked what he means by the word 'God,' he can only say that just as long acquaintance with a man of great character may deeply influence one's whole manner of conduct... if contempla- tion and study of the physico-psychical universe can imbue a man with principles of conduct analogous to the influence of a great man's works or conversation, then that analogue of mind-for it is impossible to say that any human attribute is literally applicable-is what he means by 'God"' (6.502). While we cannot prove God's existence, "we can catch a fragment of his Thought, as it were" (6.502). This God is real in the sense that anything is real that retains its essential character inde- pendently of what is now or ever will be thought about it. When we think about God we are reflecting on a reality that, in Peirce's opinion, is not determined by our thoughts. God is a reality in which he finds "pretty nearly everybody more or less" to believe (6.496), as long as we remember not to render the idea too precisely. It is our precise ideas of God that are disbelieved, thinks Peirce, not the reality itself. This brief survey of Peirce's scattered observations about God reveals, on the one hand, a peculiar combination of traditionalist con- victions (e.g., God must be vaguely omnipotent; God invites us to pray; God is a necessary being) and, on the other, a conception of deity as thought, or habit, that leans strongly toward a pantheism in which all human thought-all creation, in fact-is but a fragment of divine thought. While I do not think Peirce considered himself a pantheist, his theism contains both traditionalist beliefs and this pantheistic flavor. For example, the traditionalist Peirce makes such comments as "it is a degraded conception to conceive God as subject to Time" (4.67); or, the individual who truly muses on the nature of the cosmos will necessarily come to believe that there is "a God over it all" (6.501); or, "nothing can be made out from the orderliness of Nature in regard to the existence of a God, unless it be maintained that the existence of a finite mind proves the existence of an infinite one" (6.407). Comments like these indicate his personal faith in the Christian God. However, when he describes God in terms of evolutionary love, of his categories, or as the order of the universe, then it is possible to claim that Peirce's theism is at least potentially pantheistic. The fundamental question that contemporary students of religion must ask is whether musing on the cosmos results in the necessary intuition of the God of Western monotheism, in gen- eral, of Christianity, in particular, or of no God at all? Peirce, of course, assumed the answer to this question to be that we would infer the Christian God, albeit in a manner radically different from the tra- ditional conception. 317</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion PRAGMATICISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THEISM: SOME IMPLICATIONS Their respective theisms reflect significant differences between Peirce's and James's interpretations of pragmatism. Peirce sought to achieve clarity of thought by avoiding entangling pragmaticism with truth claims. However, he developed a conception of God on the basis of his analysis of the categorical nature of mind and universe that appeared to him to be very likely necessary-even true. His pragmaticism is a logical theory, and his God is a logical aspect of the universe inhabited and interpreted by the human mind. It demands interpretation and symbolism, as a thoroughly social human being struggles to make abid- ing sense of the world in which it exists. His God is the order of the whole, an infinite mind that Peirce thinks is the logical counterpart of the finite mind. Truth in this system is independent of the individual and requires the efforts of many persons over time even to be approx- imated. And, according to the fallibilism that characterizes pragmati- cism, we can never even be certain that we have approximated the truth. James transformed Peirce's pragmatic maxim into a matter of indi- vidual choice and behavior, emphasizing the relationship between truth and individual will. While not reducing any possible deity to psychological categories, he nonetheless interprets God in light of his understanding of the field of consciousness. Nowhere is this more apparent than in A Pluralistic Universe, where he claims that "my present field of consciousness is a centre surrounded by a fringe that shades insensibly into a subconscious more.... [And] just as we are co-con- scious with our own momentary margin, may not we ourselves form the margin of some more really central self in things which is co-con- scious with the whole of us? May not you and I be confluent in a higher consciousness, and confluently active there, tho we now know it not?"28 This "co-conscious" other is James's finite God. It is real and true because individuals believe in and need God. While James's pragma- tism presupposes that existence entails relationships, his philosophy of religion focuses strictly on the effects of religious belief on the lives of individuals. His pragmatic theism thus assumes the primacy of subjec- tivity and introspection. Despite their differences about the nature of God, both philosophers reflect the Western tradition in equating the feeling of being at home in the universe, combined with a certain awe in response to its lawful nature, with theism. Even here, however, each is aware that traditional monotheism is seriously challenged by the development of the modern 28 James, A Pluralistic Universe, pp. 130-31. 318</page><page sequence="16">The Hypothesized God of Peirce andJames sciences and the encounter with non-Western religions that have come increasingly to characterize the modern age. In closing, let us consider each of these developments. The pragmaticist/pragmatist encounter with non-Western religions hinges on Peirce's and James's rejection of theological dogmatism. James admits that his preference for monotheism is based, at least in part, on his awareness that the term "usually gives offense."29 Peirce bluntly observes that a reasonable individual will "see that men in other countries and in other ages have held to very different doctrines from those which they themselves have been brought up to believe." Such persons "cannot help seeing that it is the mere accident of their having been taught as they have and of their having been surrounded with the manners and associations that they have, that has caused them to believe as they do and not far differently." That is to say, honesty cannot "resist the reflection that there is no reason to rate their own views at a higher value than those of other nations and other centuries; thus giving rise to doubts in their minds." Consequently, "the willful adherence to a belief, and the arbitrary forcing of it upon others, must .. .both be given up" (5.381-82). Although neither Peirce norJames is quite willing to abandon mono- theism, they do limit its scope rather severely. To be consistent, it seems that the pragmaticist/pragmatist must either abandon the hypoth- esis altogether, a solution neither Peirce norJames condones, or accept wholeheartedly the fact that a modified theism is but one religious option among the many offered within the world's diverse cultures. Any form of theism can be given rational support, provided the inter- preter remains true to a consistent set of first principles, but no inter- pretation is necessarily correct and perhaps none is necessary at all. This is the central uncertainty that marks James's and Peirce's theisms as thoroughly modern in outlook. Despite this uncertainty and in spite of the apparent tension between their personal beliefs and philosophical perspectives, both James and Peirce offer a substantial resource for contemporary students of religion faced with the difficulty of making sense of religious pluralism without, however, being able to rely on a unifying transcendent symbol that is universally acceptable. That is to say, "God" no longer functions as the central unifying symbol for Western culture, at least in the way that the deity has been traditionally conceived.30 29 Ibid., p. 140. 30 Three recent discussions of the decline of the Western God are: James Turner, Without God, Without Creed: The Origins of Unbelief in America (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985); Eberhard Jiingel, God as the Mystery of the World, trans.

The Spiritual Crisis of Western Civilization (New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston, 1983). 319</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion By rejecting the primacy of dogma and in arguing that theism is hypothetical rather than certain, James and Peirce reduce monotheism in particular, and theism in general, to one religious option among others. If we accept this implication of the fallibilistic interpretation of religion, then we find ourselves in concert with those theisms, such as may be found in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, which regard gods as expressions of the deepest character of the cosmos, needed by some but unnecessary for those who truly grasp the nature of existence. While neither philosopher is finally willing to reject theism outright, in their philosophical methods they remain sensitive to this possibility. In so doing, they provide a valuable resource for reflecting on the mean- ing of theism in a culture that has grown increasingly indifferent to the question. Finally, the pragmaticist/pragmatist interpretation of theism rejects an assumption, commonly made today, that science can provide models for advancing the cause of religion. Christian Fundamentalists, Evangelicals, and Liberals alike have a tendency to believe that a truly adequate religion can be developed on the basis of a properly under- stood science. Evidence abounds, ranging from liberal accommoda- tions to theories of biology and physics to Fundamentalist attempts to prove the literal truth of the Bible on the basis of a so-called creation science, to support the presumption that a good many contemporary believers think that the models of a correctly interpreted science can give new life to traditional convictions. A pragmaticist/pragmatist philosophy of religion does not look favorably on this assumption that sound religion depends on scientific discovery. James and Peirce understood the relationship of science and religion to be neither mutually destructive nor mutually supportive. Rather, they regarded the two as independent spheres of interpretation that certainly influence each other and share a common basis in instinc- tive experience but develop on their own respective terms. Perhaps the greatest impact of modern science on our understanding of religion is the fallibilistic attitude itself and the attendant realization that no single interpretation of religion, or of God, is superior to any or all others. Having accepted this attitude makes it possible at least to look more clearly at those common human experiences that give rise to diverse religious beliefs, some of which entail theism and others of which do not. This, in fact, is whatJames and Peirce have done. Their intellectual honesty makes both of them admit that no one, not even the pragmaticist or pragmatist, can claim that a particular theism is abso- lutely true. Each stated only that it seemed to him that his interpreta- tion of God was the most plausible one available, given his understand- ing of the pragmatic maxim. 320</page><page sequence="18">The Hypothesized God of Peirce and James James and Peirce, in their ways of addressing the question and in the interpretations that they develop, offer a position that helps us to make sense of religious theism without demanding that belief in God be a requirement for authentic faith. Specific dogmatic beliefs will not last forever and can never be more than hypothetical. The experiences that give rise to such beliefs will, however, remain as long as there are human beings. If we are to understand humanity as instinctually or inherently religious, then we must accept the fact that there are many equally authentic ways to express this impulse. As we honestly recog- nize this fact, then we may find that Peirce and James do not simply offer resources for reinterpreting traditional Christian conceptions of God but that they also offer a position that requires openness to other religions by the very fact of rejecting the idea that any God is an abso- lutely necessary hypothesis. Even Peirce, who comes very close to making God a necessary component of the logical universe, is forced to withdraw from a strong claim of necessity and acknowledge that the "humble argument" is only a hypothesis that, like any other, must be proven true or false over the experimental long run. This, at least, is the direction in which the pragmaticist/pragmatist theism is headed, despite the fact that its leading practitioners preferred Christianity over other religious traditions. And this theoretical openness to the validity and equality of diverse religious perspectives is, in my view, one of the principal values of the pragmaticist/pragmatist interpretation of God. 321</page></plain_text>
