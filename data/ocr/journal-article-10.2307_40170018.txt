<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cultural Collecting Fever in New Mexico: Figurines and Governor L. Bradford Prince Patricia Fogelman Lange Imagine my surprise during a recent investigation of pottery fig- urines when I came across an article suggesting that a significant num- ber of stone idols were reproduced in the late 1800s, sold as excavated artifacts from Pueblo ruins, and modeled after an existing ritual tradi- tion. I realized that figurative images have long been reproduced in the Pueblo world from stone or pottery with incising and/or paint as dec- oration, but they were relatively rare forms. A small number of exca- vated figures have been described in the archaeological literature, sug- gesting relationships to legends, fertility, and witchcraft (e.g., Bandelier 1892; Hewett 1906; Nelson 1914; Dumarest 1919; Kidder 1932; Morss 1954) . Believed to be sacred objects encouraging regeneration, they were classified as the same form of imitative magic as Frazer (1940: 11-37) discussed in his classic work. Small (or large) stone images - human, animal, or formless - were often termed effigies and utilized for personal power or in curing ceremonies, frequently adorned with miniature bows and arrows, necklaces, whistles, or paint. My purpose in the following paper is to shed light on the stone idol collection owned by Governor L. Bradford Prince in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries based within a newly created market. The impact of this genre of manufactured idols on the archaeologi- cal community, which at first believed them to be authentic and later to be fakes, was enormous. They were created forty years after the United States gained control of the territory of New Mexico and at a time of increased commodification of ethnic arts due to railroad transportation of visitors and industrial-made goods. Whether of pottery or stone, fig- urines as an art form were examples of "markers" as Graburn (1976: 5) Patricia Fogelman Lange has a Ph.D. in art and culture from New Tork University. She is a Research Associate at the Museum of Indian Arts &amp; Culture/Laboratory of Anthropology and is teaching a course in art and anthropology at Santa Fe Community College.</page><page sequence="2">218 * Journal of the Southwest defined the word, "important in presenting to the outside world an ethnic image that must be maintained and projected as part of the all- important boundary-defining system." The creator of these idols was a member of Cochiti Pueblo. Among the Rio Grande pueblos, Cochiti has been home to a number of inno- vative changes in artistic traditions during the past 125 years.1 But in- novation is not synonymous with reproduction and claims of ancient heritage representing something they were not. Thus, the following condensed excerpt elaborating upon these stone reproductions by the early linguist John P. Harrington (n.d.) piqued my investigation: While making a study of the ethnology of the Keres Pueblos of New Mexico I have obtained information concerning an enor- mous number of fraudulent stone "idols" manufactured some years ago by an Indian of Cochiti, who pretended to have discov- ered them in ancient pueblo ruins. They were sold by the Indian in Santa Fe and have until recently been exhibited in the rooms of the Historical Society of New Mexico in that city. A fraud so unique in its nature and conducted on such gigan- tic scale was never before perpetrated in the history of American archaeology. The idea of forging the "idols" originated in the mind of an erratic Indian named Cleto Yurina, who preferred to associate with Mexicans rather than with his fellow tribesmen and was in need of money for gambling and drinking purposes. As- sisted only by his wife, this Indian hacked the images out of stones, working secretly in a wild dell in the mountains north of Cochiti, and smuggled them into Santa Fe on burro back, where he dis- posed of them to the number of many hundred. The story of the manufacture of the objects is a matter of com- mon gossip among the Indians of Cochiti and among Mexicans living in the vicinity of that pueblo and at Agua Fria, a hamlet sit- uated between Cochiti and Santa Fe. These gossipers consider "Idols" too dignified a term to bestow upon the fake images, and commonly dub them "monos," meaning in Spanish "monkeys."2 Cleto,3 the Indian idol-faker, was born at Cochiti pueblo about the middle of the nineteenth century. He had, as is customary among Pueblo Indians, a Spanish name, Cleto Yurina. . . . . . . The stone "idols" were made in the summers of 1886, 1887, and 1888, as nearly as I have been able to ascertain. As stated above, Cleto was assisted by his wife, Reyes, only, and the</page><page sequence="3">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico ■&gt; 219 secret was carefully guarded from the other Indians. . . . The "idols" were made in the Arroyo Hondo. This is a small but deep canyon which runs parallel to and a short distance north of the Canada de la Cuesta Colorada. It does not empty into the latter, but reaches the Rio Grande separately. It is twelve miles north of the Cochiti pueblo in a very wild country. Mexicans sometimes call the little canyon "Canoncito Hondo" instead of "Arroyo Hondo." In the immediate neighborhood of that dell are found all of the kinds of stone used in the forgeries, i.e., tufa, sandstone and gypsum. The greater number are made of tufa, which is very easily worked and very plentiful in that locality. Cleto's only in- strument was an old axe. With this he chopped them out with great skill. The images were claimed to be "fetishes from the pueblo ruins." He pretended to have found them at ancient ruins on the Pajarito Plateau. Fetishes are said by the Indians to have within them or connected with them a magic power or mana. The idols of these Indians, as well as the counterfeits made by Cleto, fall into two classes: anthropomorphs, of which it is said in Indian, "they have the form of people," and zoomorphs, of which is said, "they have the form of wild beasts." In addition to the more realistic human forms among those of Cleto's workmanship we find some tall and cylindrical like a post, called in Indian, "tall idols." Of these it is also said: "they resem- ble a stick of wood." Another deviation from the usual style of these anthropomorphic specimens is that which consists of a spheroidical rock on the broad side of which eyes, nostrils and mouth are indicated by crude incisions. Of these the Indians say: "it is merely a face," and they laugh especially at the idea of their being called "idols." It is in some of these water-worn and not ar- tificially shaped ones that the recent and fraudulent character of the carving is especially noticeable. As soon as a number were finished they were buried. This was done merely as a preventative lest any one find or see them, and not in order to give them an ancient appearance. When ready for a trip to Santa Fe, Cleto and his wife packed the idols in gunny- sacks. In transporting a load the following route was taken. Start- ing from the mountain den where they were made, they went down the Arroyo Hondo in an easterly direction about four hun-</page><page sequence="4">220 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Figure 1. 50468/12 Cochiti figurine, early twentieth century.

They followed this trail to the north, crossing the high Potrero de los Alamos, and descended into Alamo Canyon. Taking the trail running down this canyon they forded the Rio Grande at the mouth of the Alamo and then took the trail leading up the Canoncito de los Cimarrones on the east side of the river. Tra- versing the mountainous heights at the head of that canyon they passed between the Cerro Colorado on the south and the Cerro Mojino on the north and descended into the place known in Spanish as Bocandos. It is there that the first houses were passed. They went thence to Agua Fria, and then to Santa Fe. The most casual examination of the "idols" convinces one of the falsity. That there is such an astounding number of them also belies their genuine-ness. In all the excavations that have been made in the district north of Cochiti only two stone idols have been found and these bear no resemblance in style or type to</page><page sequence="5">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico &lt;■ 221 Cleto's counterfeits. He may have had a few genuine specimens as patterns for some of his forms. The Indians criticise one sharply for calling these forgeries idols or fetiches. They say they are nothing but monos (Spanish monos, "monkeys"). They regard the manufacture and successful passing off of these fakes as the greatest joke ever played by an In- dian on the Americans. It is said about Cochiti that Cleto gave each idol a separate name, claiming that it was some special divin- ity. It is needless to add that no living Indian is able to connect a single one with the fetish of any Indian divinity, although fetishes of the two war-gods, and several animal gods are in common use at Cochiti. A large consignment of the counterfeits found its way to the Smithsonian Institution some years ago but were never exhibited there. A collection of them has also been displayed in the Metro- politan Museum in New York City. By far the largest number that has ever been shown publicly was on exhibition until recently at the rooms of the New Mexico Historical Society in Santa Fe. After reading this narrative, I am certain the reader is perplexed and questioning how L. Bradford Prince relates to the previously men- tioned stone images. I hope to clarify this enigma. L. BRADFORD PRINCE: A RISE TO POLITICAL PROMINENCE Le Baron Bradford Prince (1840-1922) was born and died in Flush- ing, New York, but considered New Mexico his second home. Born into a prominent family with descendants dating back to the May- flower, he was a Columbia Law School graduate of 1866, an author, orator, jurist, collector, and historian. His involvement in New Mexico included: 1879-1883, appointment as chief justice and subsequent res- ignation; 1883, conception and supervision of the Tertio-Centennial celebration, a historical pageant, while simultaneously assuming the presidency of the New Mexico Historical Society;4 1884, defeated in a congressional race, he turned his energy toward his law practice, writ- ing, historical research, and the collection of archaeological and histor- ical objects; and in 1889-1893, was appointed governor of the terri-</page><page sequence="6">222 * Journal of the Southwest tory of New Mexico by President Benjamin Harrison at the urging of railroad and financial interests. While presiding in this office, Prince transformed the Palace of the Governors into "a treasure house of ar- chaeological and historical material" (Walter 1932: 374-76). Prince's first wife died shortly after their wedding, and he subse- quently married Mary C. Beardsley (1846-1925) in 1881. The Princes retained two residences: one in New York and, for forty-three years, an- other in Santa Fe on East Palace Avenue.5 Both Mr. and Mrs. Prince maintained high social positions in Santa Fe society, lavishly entertain- ing dignitaries. An avid history enthusiast, Mrs. Prince was a lifetime member of the Historical Society, translated early Spanish archives, and wrote articles (Walter 1926: 88-89). THE PRINCE COLLECTION In the late 1800s, an obsessive need to collect was the norm and a newly created outside market stimulated production. Additionally, as early as 1879, many visitors to the Southwest were scientifically docu- menting ethnographic artifacts of a "rapidly disappearing" indigenous culture. The resulting effect of this overall "collecting fever" was a di- minished supply of handmade goods. Many values appeared to shift after American occupation of the territory, when as early as 1880, Ban- delier noted the sale of idols (Lange and Riley 1966: 233, 269). After befriending some men at Cochiti, he noted that they were willing to sell him small images of squirrels, foxes, or pumas linked to magic and ritual.6 Such figures were created only by medicine men, intended for internal ritual use, and never shown to outsiders. Amateurs as well as professionals were fascinated with Southwestern objects, and Prince was no exception. After residing and working in New Mexico for three years, his restless desire plunged him into the serious collection of pottery, stone axes, and even skeletal material (Lange and Riley 1966: 243-14). By 1885, he had amassed a consid- erable number of stone idols according to Bandelier's Final Report (1892: 152); his pursuit of and obsession with his avocation are indi- cated in the correspondence of his wife Mary Prince (SR&amp;AC), a major player in the acquisition of the Prince collection.7 In a letter to her husband dated March 5, 1886 (SR&amp;AC), Mrs. Prince wrote that Cleto Urina (named earlier by Harrington) had re-</page><page sequence="7">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico * 223 ceived fifty lashes from pueblo officers for selling a figure of a lion or bear to Prince. This punishment was instigated by Jake Gold, a knowl- edgeable Santa Fe trader, who realized the fraudulent nature of the fig- ures, neither old nor excavated from pueblo ruins, he had purchased from Cleto and relayed his discovery to friends at the pueblo. Yet, de- spite this information, Mrs. Prince decided to purchase six idols from Cleto, one with a turquoise mouth, light gray eyes, and wearing a beaded necklace, and two small enough to hold in the hand. For these Cleto was compensated with $5.65, a mended man's coat, food, an Id doll, rattle, and candy. Cleto pleaded with Mrs. Prince not to reveal her source of idols and to show them only to her husband when he returned. During the following two years, Mrs. Prince continued ac- quiring items from Cleto naively writing to her husband that she had learned "Adolfo" (Adolph Bandelier?) was at Cleto's house and "'begged &amp; pleaded offered much money if he would take him to the Canada de Cochiti for idols.' Cleto did not know anything about them. He is honest with us. I think." Cleto also brought metates, pottery, and curious implements for her to see. From her correspondence, Mrs. Prince procured a minimum of sixty-six idols for forty-five dollars but lacked funds to obtain additional purchases. THE ART OF THE STORYTELLER At this time, exaggeration and tall tales surrounding objects were common practices among Anglo traders, such as Jake Gold, in order to entertain and lure buyers into purchases. In 1882, Bandelier noted in his journal that during a visit to Jake Gold's shop, he had just missed Cleto Urina (Lange and Riley 1966: 244). This information suggested that the clever and enterprising Cleto Urina was becoming familiar with business opportunities in Santa Fe and ways of expanding his world fi- nancially. Following the lead of such role models, Cleto, too, became the storyteller, mixing reality and the spirit world and representing himself as the locator of sacred objects to accommodate the market de- mand for idols. His production of this genre was accompanied by his own tales describing their collection history as he named and identified each as a special divinity embedded with cultural meaning. At least sixty-three idols were roughly documented by Mrs. Prince in a small lined notebook8 whose pages dated from March 30, 1886 to</page><page sequence="8">224 * Journal of the Southwest September 20, 1886 (SR&amp;AC) with brief descriptions accompanied by several drawings; notations included the location or origin and the seller, such as Cleto, his mother, or J. G. (Jake Gold?). One of Mrs. Prince's descriptions was accompanied by a story of Cleto's (number 136), in which he suggested that the veins of stars on the body of one idol constituted the head and body of a child. Into the hand had been cut two eyes and a mouth of which UC" (Cleto?) said, "This is a woman. There is the child." The illusion of antiquity was compounded by his narrative that idols were obtained at locations in or around Co- chiti, such as the estufa or kiva, Pueblo Quemada, Pueblo Colorado, Barranca Blanca, and Cile (Sile).9 In Prince's stories about his purported ethnographic finds,10 he claimed that the idols were excavated from pueblos that dated back to prehistoric times and convincingly conveyed to the reader in "New Mexico Stone Lions" (SR&amp;AC) that he had unearthed them.11 He bolstered the authenticity of his collection by theorizing that Pueblo People of New Mexico and the Hopi of Arizona were direct descen- dants of the Aztec and Toltec civilizations that had migrated from the northwest. Such was his reasoning as to why stone images emerged amongst the pueblos of New Mexico. Well read, Prince was aware that early Spanish writers such as Antonio de Espejo described the numer- ous Indian idols destroyed by Franciscan priests. But, Prince contin- ued, in the last eighteen years more than 1,000 had been excavated from pueblos decimated by fire. In their great rush to escape, he claimed, prehistoric or early historic people left their sacred possessions among the debris of "charred timber and half vitrified ashes." Prince concluded, in his publication "The Stone Lions of Cochiti" (SR&amp;AC), published in 1903, that the Stone Lions were "great fe- tiches connected with the chase" (1903: 20) and considered them the largest pieces of aboriginal sculpture that existed in the United States, comparable to the great stone sculptures of Mexico, Yucatan, and Cen- tral America.12 Objects were collected by scientists or the well-to-do as a passionate hobby. Likening the collecting of objects to books (which is not a big hurdle to jump), Benjamin suggested in "Unpacking My Library" (1969: 59-67) that collectors appeared to see through objects into their distant past and "to renew the old world - that is the collec- tor's deepest desire when he is driven to acquire new things." By taking possession of objects, the collector established a relationship of owner- ship which "is the most profound relationship that one can have to ob-</page><page sequence="9">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico &lt;■ 225 jects." And collectors probably connected to the "aura" or mystical ritual value in these and other artifacts as ownership transmitted a portion of ritual power back to the possessor. Westerners such as Prince who obsessively and passionately searched for cultural objects, were the perfect target for Cleto Urina's reproduc- tions. What Urina probably did was to physically imitate the original altering of the image while maintaining enough of the appearance to pre- serve its cultural essence. Prince, on the other hand, deconstructed the object's sacredness through a shift in context as images became aesthetic objects to be displayed. Politically, Prince was a well-known, powerful man and to be associated with him would have imbued Cleto Urina with great prestige while stimulating his productive response. Unfortunately we will never know the degree of encouragement he received from Mr. and Mrs. Prince, but Cleto anticipated and satisfied their needs by reproducing a size- able number of idols. He followed an earlier pueblo precedent when in 1880 Bandelier wrote that near Pueblo Quemado on Potrero Que- mado "many stone hammers and hatchets were found and sold by the people of Cochiti to visitors from Santa Fe" (Lange and Riley 1966: 154). Simultaneously, the acquisition of these idols confirmed the good fortune of the Princes as well as their good sense of taste. In this interrelationship, the Princes and Cleto were all "agents of change" to employ Graburn's phrase (1976: 20) as buyers and sellers in a recipro- cal market. It was the antiquity and cultural use of objects that determined value and authenticity in Prince's eyes, as he became the obsessive collector rather than the scientific authority. Intrigued by the past, age and ritual use became synonymous with authenticity. Yet, it is interesting to note that Prince could not, or chose not, to distinguish reproductions from originals. Even if he did not recognize these idols as reproductions, over time he would have acquired sufficient discriminatory skills to ob- serve visual differences in their physical characteristics. It is possible Figure 3. 362546, Tufa figure. Courtesy of Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, photograph by author.</page><page sequence="10">226 * Journal of the Southwest that his evaluative criterion was more concerned with their figurative expression of a purported sacred, cultural nature based upon associated stories. And like the trader's ability to influence innovative forms in pottery and textiles, Prince's relationship with Cleto was significant, for eventually the total number of pieces he amassed exceeded 1,600; pre- cisely 1,650 stone idols were manufactured between 1885 and the early 1890s. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY REACTS Although Prince expressed his desire to exhibit his collection at the USNM in 1897 (SR&amp;AC), by 1899 the scientific community publi- cized their dilemma and concerns with the Prince collection. They declared it to be of no scientific value due to its lack of authenticity. This evalua- tion was based upon volume, a deficiency in provenience, their apparent recent appearance, and metal tool marks.13 Or perhaps they recog- nized in the multitude of reproductions, the lack of an "aura" as "an instrument of magic" as de- scribed by Benjamin (1969: 225). This negativity was reaffirmed in the unpublished diary of Fred- erick Webb Hodge (SWM: Hodge Papers), who during his 1899 journey through New Mexico spoke of the Prince idols with great disdain: After examining the Prince ColPn with care I came to the conclusion that very few of them were ancient and that many if not most were made recently &amp; probably for purposes of sale. My surmise was later substantiated by A. F. Spiegelberg who informed me that probably all of them were manufactured by a man named Kleto of Cochiti who has a son named Anastasio. Some of the specimens in the Hist. Soc rooms are of gypsum, smeared with red paint but are fresh &amp; new where the paint did not penetrate the interstices; these also show undoubted file or rasp marks as well as evidences of fresh metal tool marks. One group has embedded as eyes modern shell beads of native manufacture with small holes drilled with a metal instru- ment &amp; fastened with fresh gum to which wool fiber adheres.

He wrote: [I] inquired what he knew about the Prince collection of idols &amp; he verified the names Kleto and his son Anastasio given me by Spiegelberg of Santa Fe. He also said the fact that Kleto was in the business of making idols was well known in Cochiti &amp; that he was well informed that Prince had contracted with Kleto to buy all he made. Once he and his uncle accidentally ran across the workshop of Kleto in the heavy undergrowth in the mtns some miles away where they both saw numerous idols that had been broken in the making. A couple of hatchets, some bits, and cold chisels were seen there. Formerly he said, Kleto tried to make idols of hard stone, but found it difficult to make them look "an- cient," consequently after that time he devoted his attention to the softer material (tufa, tuft, pumice, etc.). It was Kleto's custom to pack the images on burros &amp; take them to Santa Fe at night, off the beaten trails. On one of these trips he was surprised by some of the Cochiti in the act of packing some very tall idols on his back up a declivity, the burro not being able to get up with them. It was owing to this and the previous discovery by Cyrus and his uncle that Kleto's reputation as an "ancient idol" maker became known throughout the pueblo. Similar notes and feelings with differing details were recorded as late as 1938 by Edgar Lee Hewett, who wrote to Lansing B. Bloom (NMHLA) regarding the stone idols: I was convinced of their spurious character when I first came to New Mexico in the late nineties, and I discovered that Professor Starr had arrived at the same conclusion, probably long before I did. We compared notes on the matter about the year 1899. The complete expose of the "stone idols" was made by John P. Har- rington after he came on our staff, and is contained in a manu- script which I have on file, but which I never thought best to publish, especially as the collection practically disappeared many years ago, and no contention has been made as to its authenticity. I personally knew Cleto Yulino and his son, who between them manufactured practically all of the idols of the Prince collection, and I well knew their workshop under the big cottonwood tree down the arroyo only a few minutes' walk from the pueblo.</page><page sequence="12">228 * Journal of the Southwest Although Harrington, Hodge, and Hewett disagreed on several points in this tale, they agreed on the basic premise that the Prince idols were made by Cleto and were of recent vintage. There was disagreement as to the spelling of Cleto's first and last name, in the type of tools used, the location of the workshop, and Cleto's assistants. (I have followed the spelling for Cleto after Harrington, n.d. and Lange 1959: 514). In- terestingly, Hewett confirmed the Hodge theory that Cleto and his son (not his wife) were coworkers according to the Harrington manuscript, which lay in his files. Although Prince realized a market value of $50,000 for his collec- tion and was interested in selling it by 1900, word of the "fake" idols had spread throughout the scientific community. It is rumored that a humiliated Prince disposed of a large portion of them in a well in the patio at the Palace of the Governors, Santa Fe. A number were later un- earthed when the well was excavated in 1971 by Lambert (1985: 209) who mentioned in her paper: There seems to be an increased interest in the folk art of the Co- chiti Indian who set up a 'rain god' and effigy manufacturing fa- cility in his pueblo, and who first brought his idols to Bradford Prince and Jake Gold, both of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Indian buried his work at the site of old Kotyiti on his reservation to an- tique them. Word of his discovery of many fetishes spread beyond Santa Fe, and collectors, including a number of well known mu- seums eagerly bought many of them. After the completion of the excavation, the idols were returned to the well and, to date, remain buried there. IDOLS Images created by Cleto satisfied a Western desire to identify with the strength of the sacred and the past. Yet, the outsider will never know the degree of authenticity of the original captured by Cleto in his reproductions due to strict Pueblo regulations. But there are some archeological samples with which to compare them. For example, the four paintings Bandelier (Burrus 1969: 142-43) presented as a gift to the Vatican were entitled "Idoles: Potrero de las Vacas, Nouveau- Mexique north of Cochiti." Borrowed from Prince, these seven idols</page><page sequence="13">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico ■&gt; 229 were documented in Bandelier's journal between February and March of 1886. 1S They appeared to be textured and planed with file or rasp marks but with no accompanying description as to material, size, etc.16 Jeancon (1923: 65-66) wrote that the eccentric forms of concretion fetishes he excavated in the Chama Valley were related to their emer- gence from the supernatural, an explanation that might be applicable in this case. Such fetishes have been seen on altars at Hopi and Zuni. Jeancon (1923: plate 56), pictured fetishes made from gypsum, fluo- rite, pottery, selenite crystal, and even from black earth and grease. In "New Mexico Stone Idols" (SR&amp;AC), Prince described the larg- est number of idols in his collection as being made from hard lava, soft tufa, granite, or marble.17 The sparseness of features in some suggest great difficulty in working the hard stone. Ranging in size from several inches to five feet, some were in the shape of birds and quadrupeds while the majority were human figures. He described his figures as be- ing of three types: (1) cylindrical - measuring two to five and one-half feet high like a square post. The upper part represented a head with eyes, nose, and mouth; the remainder of the body was decorated with horizontal lines; (2) long oval - the upper part represented the head, carved arms were in three or four positions, and some had carved legs; (3) head only - possessing a diameter of three to four inches to larger than a human head. Some figures had elaborate features and expres- sions; some had flat heads while others were globular. Twelve of these images were discovered with crowns and entitled Figure 5. 372547, Tufa head.

Hewett (1906: Plate XVTa), which he designated a "War God" and categorized as a ceremonial object; Alfred V. Kidder (1932: 86-91) excavated four stone idols at Pecos Pueblo; and N. C. Nelson (1914: 90-92) exca- vated Pueblo Blanco in the Galisteo Basin and discovered in a shrine a carved stone image of fine-grain sandstone, twenty-one inches high with a flat base.19 Public institutions that hold idols in their collections are the Amer- ican Museum of Natural History, New York City, with two rectangular stone idols possibly collected by Herbert Spinden; the United States National Museum, Washington, D.C., with three idols acquired from the Prince estate; the Milwaukee Public Museum, with three examples of basalt idols: one was a rounded head and the other two were upright rectangular figures; the Brooklyn Museum, with six idols collected by Father Noel Dumarest (1919: 211) and illustrated in his monograph on Cochiti Pueblo; and the sixty-five idols from the original Prince Collection now housed at the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe.20 THE VIEW OF IDOLS IN MODERN TIMES Even though Prince died in 1922, his collection continued to be a source of scandal, as indicated in a 1932 letter from Jesse L. Nusbaum of the L of A to Neil Judd at USNM. Following the directions of Edgar Lee Hewett, Nusbaum, in the dark of night, transported a portion of the Prince Collection from the Old Governor's Palace to the basement of the old barracks building where the art museum now stands. When the Fine Art Museum was constructed, a wagonload or more of the idols was transferred to the old University of New Mexico building near the Santa Fe railroad station. Many were stolen and "used in adobe walls and lining walks of some of the residences in Santa Fe" (USNM).21 Prince's son (USNM) inherited the problem of his father's collec- tion, and when in 1932 he received a letter from the Smithsonian, he expressed his displeasure over the idols as follows: "The only practi- cal use that I have found for these Idols is to sell a pair of them to East- erners who come out here and build 'Spanish-Indian' houses, and try to make them look as odd as possible; they have them plastered in on each side of a fire place, or sometimes at the sides of a gate or drive-</page><page sequence="15">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico * 231 way." He did not believe these "house-hold Gods" to be "fakes" and remembered "as a boy how two Indians would arrive in the dead of night with these packed on the backs of burros, as they feared being seen and caught by the head priests of the Pueblo. They practically all came from the Pueblo of Cochiti." Prince's son suggested the museum retain a few and dispose of the remainder (advice which they ultimately followed). CONCLUSION Examining all the idols described, it is my conclusion that most, if not all, of the Prince collection (especially those with drilled eyes and two nostrils, several with four protrusions, those with curved arms across the chest, those that are just large heads, etc.) were probably produced by Cleto Urina and his assistant(s). I will go out on a limb and say that the three at the USNM, three at the Milwaukee Public Museum, at least four at the Brooklyn Museum, two at the American Museum of Natural History, the seven painted by Bandelier, and those at the L of A were creations of Cleto's imagination. These stone idols reflect a moment in Southwestern ethnographic and cultural collecting history - a time in which cultures as well as objects reflecting those cul- tures were passionately collected. Now I sit and wonder whether authenticity, which early scientists disputed, is the question to be posed, or should one view these stone idols as objects of art because historical contexts affect what is consid- ered artifact or art? Art never remains static and what is considered art is reflective of when it was produced. But, in the case of stone idols, the scientific world viewed these objects as neither artifact or art. Appar- ently the use of modern technology such as metal rasps destroyed the authenticity of the artifact, whereas according to modern values, to- day's viewer applauds artistic innovation. And when does an ethno- graphic object become an art object? The answer must be when it is de- contextualized, exhibited outside its original purpose, and distanced as an aesthetic object according to those "authorities" who determine what is art. As the Santa Fe market enlarged, many ethnographic sacred and secular objects were exhibited and/or sold as art. Equally complex is the factor of time. Do the same reproductions which express a cultural interior space become authentic over time and</page><page sequence="16">232 * Journal of the Southwest valuable in their own right? Do we, through sympathetic magic, grant "the copy the character of the original, the representation the power of the represented" (Taussig 1993: xviii)? If so, the resulting effect is that reproductions create their own canons of authenticity, especially after one hundred years. Another perplexing question revolves around what constitutes In- dian "art." Is it something made by a full-blooded Indian or can some- one with a partial Indian bloodline qualify? Does a reproduction by Cleto, a full-blooded Cochiti Indian, not constitute the authentic char- acter of the Prince reproductions, since they were made of similar ma- terials (stone) to those not intended for internal use? Clarifying this thought further Benjamin (1969: 224) wrote, "The unique value of the 'authentic' work of art had its basis in ritual." Or perhaps this story has nothing to do with these types of philo- sophic questions. Maybe stone idols become almost secondary as game playing becomes primary; Cleto evolved into the master storyteller and Prince into the butt of his joke. * ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Thank you to Louise Stiver, Curator of Collections, and to Anita McNeese, Registrar, both at the Laboratory of Anthropology for their assistance.

Beginning in the early 1870s, a number of Cochiti potters began to move away from creating traditional bowls and ollas to creating upright figures. Succeeding this was the short-lived "secretly made" genre of stone images cre- ated by one Cochiti man. And in recent history, Helen Cordero instituted a "Storyteller" tradition which revolutionized Pueblo potterymaking to become a paradigm for many contemporary Pueblo potters. 2. This term was discussed by Bandelier as early as 1880. Pueblo people be- lieved that in order to injure another person, one "makes a mono, that is, an image of earth or clay, of the one whom he wishes to hurt (selecting, if possi- ble, earth on which he has urinated), and pierces this image" (Lange and Riley 1966:160). 3. Cleto Urina was a mail messenger for Adolph F. Bandelier (Lange and Riley 1966: 269). In 1874 he married Reyes Archibeque (Lange 1959: 514), who died in 1897. Cleto died in 1899; a son, Anastacio, was born in 1876 and died in 1901; another son, Sebastian, was born in 1890. According to church records, several other children were born in between but probably died while very young. Only the names of Cleto, Anastacio, and Sebastian appeared in the 1897 census of Cochiti (Starr 1897: 40). Cleto was a member of the Kwirena Society and Sebastian was a member of the Koshare Society. Sebastian married an Anglo woman and moved to Wisconsin to become known as Chief Ever- green Tree, performing bird whistle imitations at the Wisconsin Dells and else- where (Lange 1959: 512-14). 4. Prince held this position until his death in 1922. Although the New Mexico Historical Society received its charter in 1860, it only began function- ing in the 1880s through the efforts of William G. Ritch. When Prince became president, he became obsessed with the organization, giving his time and own financial resources for the acquisition of objects of historical interest (Twitchell 1925: 415-16). 5. Harrington (1916:232) stated that Prince had a ranch near Placita Larga as well. 6. Additionally, these men mentioned small alabaster figures of Masseua, the War Captain, and others forty centimeters high (Lange and Riley 1966: 261) which they could obtain for sale. 7. Some items in the Prince collection were identified by two Cochiti men as medicine gods (Lange, Riley, and Lange 1975: 438, n552) or healing fig- ures, collectively owned sacred objects that should never be sold and whose creator must remain anonymous (Lange and Riley 1966: 191). Stone images are traditionally used on ceremonial altars to represent characters from narra- tive legends. Elsie Clews Parsons (1925: 107-8) called small stone images of Masewi, the War God, a fetish. White (1942: 330^2) wrote that such images usually depicted Masewi and Oyoyewi (the Twin War Gods), Paiyatyamo (young children), and animals. Effigies, like altars, help man obtain power from the deities. Stone figures are also termed "Kopershtaia," or our Mother, which remains ambiguous in definition and understanding. Kopershtaia is served by</page><page sequence="18">234 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Masewi and Oyoyewi in Shipapu (Dumarest 1919: 209). Human stone images often have suggestions of arms pressed against their body, sometimes legs, and barely delineated facial features. Parsons, in Dumarest (1919: 210), suggested that zoomorphic idols represented six cardinal directions: north, the mountain lion; west, the bear; south, the badger; east, the wolf; zenith, the eagle; and nadir, the shrew. 8. Mrs. Prince described idols that ranged from two and one-half to nine- teen inches high, were of red lava, black lava, dark gray lava, brown lava, mar- ble, sandstone, and quartz, and took the form of humans, birds, dogs, animals, or rounded stones. 9. I have found the descriptive terms relating to site identities and locations in Bandelier (Lange and Riley 1966), Hewett (1906, NMHLA), Prince (1903), Harrington (n.d.,1916), and Hodge's (SWM) writings vague and difficult. Even Bandelier (1892: 158) stated that "the nomenclature varies greatly according to the source whence it is obtained." Various accounts may have reflected the knowledge of these locations at that time, but this information has not been perpetuated in present-day USGS maps. What can be determined is that most ruins were clustered around the Bland Canyon area near the Stone Lions and that the large pueblo ruin described by Prince could be Yapashi. See Harring- ton (1916: 409-56, Map 28) for the best mapping of this area and descriptions of sites. According to Bandelier (Lange and Riley 1966:152-69), Pueblo Quemado or burned pueblo was a prevalent name, and there was also a Potrero de la Canada Quemada. But Harrington, in his research, was not able to locate it. There was a canyon and stream called Potrero de la Cuesta Colorada near Ya- pashi or the Stone Lions, which Bandelier (1892: 152, 157) described as in the cliffs above the Stone Lions. He added that the name Canada de la Cuesta Co- lorada, was derived from the "seams of blood-red iron ochre that appear in cliffs west of it, and at the base of the San Miguel Mountains." Harrington (1916: 422-23) said that Capulin Canyon is another name for Canon de la Cuesta Colorada. The ruins of a Pueblo Colorado exist today in the Galisteo Basin. Barranca Blanca means "white banks" or "white canyon" and was three miles north of Cochiti in Canada de la Peralta, which widened into Canyon Quemada, located seven miles west of Cochiti. 10. Prince was quite determined to establish his expertise on a national level by contacting institutions and heads of state. As a consequence of his ef- fort, a total of ninety- five idols and fetishes were received and confirmed in an 1890 receipt from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which had displayed a number of them. Additionally, Prince gifted a stone idol to the President of the United States in 1890 (SR&amp;AC). By 1892, the Counsel Gen- eral of Spain requested that the Prince collection of "Gods" be exhibited at the Madrid Exposition, and fifty-eight idols were displayed there (SR&amp;AC). The USNM considered the Prince collection part of its exhibit at the 1892 World's Columbian Exposition (SR&amp;AC). 1 1 . Either Pnnce was misinterpreted or he actually stated that his collection was taken from Chaco ruins. In 1892, both the Milwaukee Public Museum</page><page sequence="19">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico &lt;■ 235 and the Oneida Historical Society of New York (SR&amp;AC) wanted to examine the idols and requested a donation. (Could such stories be likened to the child's game of "telephone," in which the beginning statement sent through the tele- phone line becomes distorted into a statement differing from the original?) 12. Bandelier had made a journey to these areas twenty- three years earlier and had published an account in 1881 (1892: 152, n2). Since the two men were well acquainted (Lange &amp; Riley 1966:168-76), Prince would have been aware of Bandelier's work. In fact, Bandelier was introduced by Prince at an 1886 lecture Bandelier presented to the New Mexico Historical Society on pueblo pottery (Lange and Riley 1996:125). In the same year, Bandelier was commissioned by Archbishop J. B. Salpointe of Santa Fe to present Pope Leo XIII a written account accompanied by paintings of the Southwestern missions in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of his priesthood occurring the fol- lowing year (Lange, Riley, and Lange 1975: 8); four of Bandelier's paintings were of idols from the Prince Collection (Burrus 1969:142-43). 13. An additional factor may have been confusion caused by the inversion of humor so prevalent in many cultures especially the Pueblo world (see Lange 1993). Harrington was probably correct in assuming that Cleto Urina's repro- ductions were viewed as a joke by the Pueblo world. 14. Cyrus Dixon, born in 1865, was a principal informant and guide for Bandelier. He acquired his American name during his years at the Carlisle School, but he also was known as Santiago Quintana or Zashua, the name of the leading character in Bandelier's novel The Delight Makers. 15. Bandelier described idols discovered at the pueblo ruin of Yapashi (1892: 152, nl) as "rudely carved human figures" and larger ones were cate- gorized as "Yap-a-shi," a name applied only to humans as opposed to animal forms. "Other names given to such images in Queres idiom are I'jiar-e Ko, and Uashtesh-kor-o. Many of them may represent the same deity or idol. The Tshayanyi, or medicine-men, have most of them in their possession, although some are in private hands." They were identified by a Cochiti man as medicine gods but did not resemble any other idols in the literature. Harrington (1916: 419) disagreed with Bandelier stating: "'Yapashi' refers to the Stone Lions Shrine, although I find no statement to this effect in Bandelier, who called the pueblo ruin 'Yap'a'shi' because stone idols were discovered at the ruin by Mr. L. B. Prince." Yap'a'shi means "sacred enclosure. The name is merely one of many descriptive terms which might be applied to the shrine by the Cochiti In- dians, and is not a real name of the shrine." 16. One was an upnght reddish figure with a rounded head tilted to one side. The face was ground flat, into which the rounded eyes and mouth ap- peared to be inset stones or beads, the nose was sharply angular, and around the neck was a beaded necklace. The body, with a flat base, seemed to be heav- ily marked by a metal tool. The arms were bent upward across the chest and the idol had flexed awkward legs. Another single image with a reddish cast on a flat base was observed on a three-quarter angle. Again the face was ground flat with an inset bead or stone and downward-turned mouth. The body was sim- pler than the first one described, with horizontal markings suggesting tool</page><page sequence="20">236 * Journal of the Southwest work and two bent arms across the chest but in a tighter position almost ex- tending from side to side. There were no legs. The third painting showed two small images on a flat base in the same style. One had a groove for the mouth while the other had a circular mouth with an inset bead or stone. A groove sep- arated the head from the body. The fourth painting presented three (seemingly small) images. Two were ovoid on a flat base with head and body planed. One had drilled holes for the eyes and mouth, and the back appeared heavily grooved. The other had beads or stones inset for the eyes and mouth. The third figure differed greatly from all others in these paintings and appeared to be made from a soft tufa-like porous material. In profile, it was a darker brownish/red with a small rounded, ovoid head and almost circular body. There was a sug- gestion of an eye and four stubby protrusions opposite the curved back sug- gesting arms and legs. 17. Strangely, Prince classified the Stone Lions, more than six feet long and carved of solid rock, as being taxonomically in the same category as other idols he collected. Today we know that the Stone Lions are sacred images for the Pueblo of Cochiti as well as several other tribes. 18. Four bizarre-looking heads with two eyes and two nostril holes from the Prince Collection were photographed in "Leslie's Weekly" (SR&amp;AC); three of these possess down-turned mouths while one has an upturned mouth. They all have a large cup-like shape on the top of the head which might suggest a topknot of feathers worn by men in dance ceremonies. In Mrs. Prince's lined notebook are several sketches: number 101 is an old red lava idol nine inches in height and accompanied by a sketch of arms in low relief meeting on the chest. Another, number 104, is a black lava idol measuring seven and three-quarters inches on a flat base with four horizontal protrusions from the midsection of the body suggesting arms; a rounded head with two holes for eyes and one for the mouth extends from this body. A drawing of number 117 which is a light gray-pink sandstone, highly stylized profile head of a man with no size dimen- sions but described as "head of man." It has an eye, nose, and mouth. Another, number 120, is the profile of a dark gray lava animal, five and three-quarters inches long, which resembles a modern bear fetish. Number 120 is an animal in black fine lava drawn in profile with protruding ears, eye, snout, and stylized legs. A white quartz idol, number 136, is twelve inches tall, with a cylindrical head, two small upright ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and a circular mouth. 19. The squatting figure Hewett excavated has two arms compressed against the body and almost reaching the closely flexed legs carved in low relief, and a head shaped from the same piece of stone with no neck but two holes for eyes and one for the mouth; two protrusions on the chest suggest breasts and another suggests genitalia. Kidder found one figure lying over a kiva near the plaza of the North Quad- rangle; it measures eleven and one-quarter inches high and is carved from dark green chlorite schist. The squatting figure, with elbows on its knees and hands spread across the chest with a suggestion of fingers, has closely flexed legs and the suggestion of feet. Across the top of the head is a deep notch, possibly for a feathered headdress or wooden tablitta. Presumably, several holes in the</page><page sequence="21">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico * 237 notch held feathers. The head has nose and ears in relief while the eyes and mouth are incised. The highly polished surface indicates frequent handling. The second, smaller figure is eight and three-eighths inches high and is also of chlorite schist, with little of the head remaining. The neck is indented and the head arises from squared shoulders. It is a rectangular block without legs but with arms and grooved fingers. Remains of red paint are evident on the body and head. A third idol is a crudely shaped sandstone rectangle sixteen inches high that has lost its head. The flat- based body has arms that meet on the chest. The last idol is of hard gray limestone measuring eight inches high. The rounded head arises from a slight indentation indicating a neck upon an ovoid shaped, flat-based body. Bent arms, neck, and nose are barely suggested and it is with- out eyes or mouth. All idols exhibit bent arms close to the chest, but their ma- terials differ. Examples of a number of small worked sherds thought to be hu- man effigies have been uncovered, as well as a large one made from a piece of Biscuit ware (Kidder 1932:150-52). The figure found by Nelson is cylindrical in shape with the head tapering above the oval face as if wearing a hat. The eyes, nose, and mouth are very dis- tinct and protrude from the flat face. Nelson said that the face is covered with dark red paint while the body has traces of green. Both colors have powdered mica added. This image is totally dissimilar to any other previously described. 20. The figures at the American Museum are eighteen inches high with two drilled eyes and nostrils, and a wide mouth. One has curved bent arms and flexed legs, while the other has no legs. Catalog cards from the USNM, dated April 9, 1935, indicate that three examples from the Prince collection were ac- cessioned as a gift into the fraudulent antiquities section. One idol is a rectan- gle thirteen inches high of white/gray tufa. The slightly curved front has two eyes, two nostrils, two cheek incisions, and a double ringed band separating the head from the body. The back of the stone is planed. The second is an ovoid human face nine and one-half inches tall, with two drilled eyes and nostrils, wide down-turned lips, and two ears protruding from the side of the head. The last is an animal made of tan/gray tufa eight inches high with an exposed spine and standing on four short legs. The head has two slight protrusions suggest- ing pointed ears, with drilled holes for both eyes and nostrils as well as an anus. In the Milwaukee Public Museum is one rounded head five inches high with two large drilled holes for the eyes and nostrils and a large hole at the base. An- other was fourteen inches high made from a solid piece of stone with two drilled holes for eyes and nostrils, the forehead had a horizontal carved crease and an upturned wide mouth; a double ringed band separated the head from the short body on a flat base, and bent arms rested on the chest. The second figure was twenty-one inches high with two drilled holes for eyes and nostrils and a carved crease turning slightly upward as a mouth. A single ringed band separated the head from the flat based body. One arm was bent upward across the chest and the other turned down, both possessing long frog-like append- ages. No accession information was available for them, but they were probably the idols requested in an 1892 letter.</page><page sequence="22">238 + Journal of the Southwest The Brooklyn Museum collection has two full figures on a flat base with drilled eye holes and nostrils, no mouth, and no legs; one arm is bent across the chest and the other extended downward. One figure has a protrusion on its head which suggests a horn. Two are large heads on flat bases: one rounded and the other, oval. They both have drilled holes for eyes and nostrils with in- cising for the mouth. The oval head has a chin and neck. The other two figures have bent arms across the chest and flexed legs. In the smaller of the two, both arms and legs are curved rather than angular. It has a sharply defined head with the face shown as a flat plane, two rounded eyes, and a mouth. The larger one has two small holes for eyes and one for a mouth. The top of the head slants on an angle. In 1959, a collector accumulated seventy- five to eighty pieces from the original Prince collection over a ten-year period. Eventually, in 1984, he do- nated sixty-five pieces to the L of A, Museum of New Mexico. The majority range from two and three-eighths inches to twenty- two inches high. Among them are human figures, several animal shapes, three human heads, and the re- maining few are bizarre-looking or of an undetermined identification. Some of the human figures have bent arms raised toward the face while a number have one arm turned upward and the other downward. Some have no arms and only one has bent legs. One, at least, has turquoise eyes while the remainder have a hole for eyes; a number have two holes for nostrils, and some have a slit or hole for a mouth. Only one appears to have no features except a division of the whole into three parts suggesting a head, middle section, and lower body. Three have a rectangular head and body while the others are curved or pointed. None of these are like those previously discussed, but they do retain some resemblance. 21. A 1934 memorandum to Dr. Wetmore from Neil M. Judd at the Na- tional Museum (USNM), extracted forty years of correspondence concerning the forty stone "idols" first received in April, 1902, as follows: May 5, 1892, Prince to Professor Mason: idols excavated for seven or eight years. Possess many and want to sell 50 for $1,000 or $20 per figure. September 21, 1892, A. F. Spiegelberg to H. W. Henshaw: might be able to obtain some stone idols for $5.00 each if interested. September 28, 1892, Prince to Major Powell: suggested that the museum purchase 100 idols for $1,500 at Chicago World's Fair. January 3, 1893, Henshaw to F. W. Hodge: Major Powell agreed that they do not want idols. Because Prince will not furnish collection data, specimens are valueless. January 16, 1893, James Mooney to Professor Holmes: discussed Prince collection with Dr. Matthews, who felt Prince was a competent judge in New Mexico. "If he gives false statements it is because he himself has been deceived." April 1, 1897, Walcott to Prince: accepted earlier offer to deposit some idols in National Museum. April 26, 1897, Walcott to Prince: expressed gratitude that Prince will send collection.</page><page sequence="23">Cultural Collecting in New Mexico ■&gt; 239 August 2, 1901, Max Pracht of Texas to Professor McGee: saw notice in lo- cal paper that Prince will exhibit his "home-made fake gods and idols." Hodge doubts this, for "the idols have no scientific value." August 24, 1901, Prince to Professor Wilson: forty idols have been shipped. Undated memo, Professor Holmes: "We can do nothing but store them. They are worth nothing and ought never to have been accepted." March 2, 1903, Holmes: recommended repacking collection and storing at Prince's expense. Three broken and several abraded. March 4, 1903, Mason: recommended Prince be informed that collection will be repacked and stored, for the museum cannot purchase it. March 25, 1903, Prince: idols were lent to National Museum and never in- tended to be sold. April 13, 1903, Prince to Rathbun: enclosed copies of 1897 letters and re- gretted idols have not been exhibited. April 16, 1903, Rathbun to Prince: crowded halls do not permit exhibition of idols. February 10, 1932, Wetmore to William B. Prince: does he want his father's collection returned at his own expense? Otherwise they will dispose of them. February 17, 1932, William B. Prince to Wetmore: has no use for idols and does not care for them. March 3, 1932, Wetmore to William B. Prince: will discard idols unless re- ceives a reply. May 2, 1932, Wetmore to William B. Prince: will wait for reply until May 16. There is no additional correspondence except for an addendum by Judd, who stated he examined all forty pieces and agreed they are fraudulent, "They do not agree in technique with similar carvings excavated in New Mexico ruins by N. C. Nelson and other qualified archaeologists." Out of forty, seventeen are columnar and carved on one side; fifteen are roughly discoidal with a rude face on one side; and eight are animal figures. One is of sandstone, two are of calcitic rock, and the remainder of tufa. He recommended all forty idols be destroyed.
