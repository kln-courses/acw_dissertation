Smith's "genius" according to Bloom was manifested in bringing together within Mormonism several "fundamental princi- ples" that comprised what Bloom termed "the American religion."1 Bloom, in charac- terizing Mormonism "the American reli- gion," gave substance to a statement made by the great nineteenth-century Russian writer Leo Tolstoy who had become acquainted with the church and its beliefs as the result of correspondence between his daughter, Taty- ana, and Susa Young Gates - the talented, 1 Harold Bloom, The American Religion : The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation (New York, 1992), 77-128. According to Bloom (103) "What I call the American Religion is a far larger and more diffuse phenomenon than is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and as such seems to me to have three fundamental principles. The first is that what is best and oldest in us goes back well before Creation, and so is no part of the Creation. The second is rather than a belief founded upon mere assent. The third is that loneliness of belated American time, and the American experience of the abyss of space." articulate daughter of Brigham Young.2 Despite his extensive discussion of Mormonism, however, Bloom overlooks one important topic: the relationship between early Mormonism and antebellum reform within American society in the period before the American Civil War. Bloom's oversight is not surprising given the author's observa- tion that the Mormon church today, in com- bination with their supposed arch-rivals, fundamentalist Baptists and other American evangelicals have become "socially, politi- cally, and economically reactionary bastions of the American establishment." Bloom attributes Mormonism 's current anti-re- formist position to what he labels "a reac- tion- formation against both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young."3 In a similar vein, Lawrence Foster in his seminal 1981 study, Religion and Sexuality: The Shakers , the Mormons , and the Oneida Community , while not characterizing Joseph Smith an antebellum reformer, suggests that Mormonism's founder fits the archtype of those "displaced New Englanders" living in the "burned-over" district of New York State "attracted to an extraordinary range of cru- sades aimed at the perfection of mankind and 2For a discussion of Leo Tolstoy and his relationship to Mormonism see: Leland A.

Mormons, according to Winn, saw themselves as active propo- nents of what he labels traditional "re- publican values." Winn, while not character- izing Joseph Smith or his followers as ante- bellum reformers or even using the term "reform" to describe their activities, does label Latter-day Saint efforts to restore "republican values" as a crusade "to redeem the nation."5 More to the point, Geoffrey F. Spencer in an engaging essay entitled "Anxious Saints: the Early Mormons, Social Reform, and Status Anxiety" asserts a direct relation- ship between early Latter-day Saint concerns for certain social issues, including temper- ance, slavery, the changing status of women, and the desire of Americans, generally, to deal with these same issues. Spencer, more- over, suggests that early "Mormon efforts to reshape society could be understood as an attempt to restore a status that was seen to be diminished and to resolve anxieties created by the emergence of a pluralistic, changing social environment." Specifically, Spencer 4Lawrencc Foster, Religion and Sexuality: The Shakers, the Mormons, and the Oneida Community (New York, 1991), 129. Kenneth Wum, Exiles in a Land of Liberty: Mormons in America, 1830-1846 (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1989), 2-3. The so-called "republican ideology" that the Mormons sought to preserve according to Winn "rested on the foundation of a virtuous citzenry composed of independent property-owning men whose self-reliance, civic spirit, and hardy disdain for enfeebling luxury separated them from the very wealthy and the very poor.... The republican citizen scorned luxury... Republican government balanced precariously between anarchy and tyranny. Good citizens were expected to arm themselves, form militias, and exercise constant vigilance in putting down challenges that threatened to upset this fragile equilibrium." sees Mormon reform activities within the context of what he terms "status anxiety."6 But Spencer also stated that such "status anxiety" was not unique to the Latter-day Saints, noting that "the issues of moral re- form were one way through which" any cultural group, be they Latter-day Saints or otherwise, "acts to preserve, defend or en- hance the dominance of its own style of living within the total society."7 Looking to the ideas presented by Geoffery Spencer and others as a point of departure, it would appear that Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saint movement that he founded can be better understood within the context of the broader movement to bring about significant social, political, and eco- nomic reform within American society dur- ing the first half of the nineteenth-century. Like other nineteenth-century reformers, Joseph Smith was influenced by his back- ground, especially the economic and social situation of his family. The future Mormon leader, during the years prior to 1 830 and the formation of the Latter-day Saint movement, had good reason for deep anxieties about the social-economic status of himself and his family. Born on 23 December 1805 in Sharon, Vermont, Joseph Smith, Jr., the fourth child in a family of nine, was exposed to unsettled, uprooted conditions in a frontier environment. By the time young Joseph was eleven, his parents, Joseph Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith, had moved their family in and out of nine different New England communi- ties. 6Geoffrey F.

His fa- ther, Joseph Sr., due to continuing economic mis- fortune, had difficulty pro- viding for his family. After repeatedly failing as a far- mer in various parts of New England and unable to establish himself as a merchant, the elder Smith in 1816 moved his family west to Palmyra, New York.8 Looking for a new beginning in this frontier environment, he hoped to benefit from the boom generated by the recent completion of the Erie Canal. But by the time he arrived with his family, the best farming land had been taken and the boom had subsided into hard times culminating in the Panic of 1 8 1 9. 9 These dif- ficulties, combined with three successive crop fail- ures, ruined the elder Smith's hope for future wealth. This adversity, moreover, "may have driven [Joseph Sr.] to excessive drinking, a habit he apparently retained until his conversion to Mormonism many years later."10 As for Young Joseph, he, along with his brothers and sisters, "received scant school- ing" because of the compelling need to secure employment to supplement the fam- ily's meager income.11 Young Joseph work- ed as a day laborer on various neighboring Lucy Mack Smith Drawn from life by Frederick Piercy, 1 853.

Money-digging through the use of various devices including "seer stones" was "a common form of folk magic practiced primarily by the poor and itinerant in New England and western New York." But it was generally "opposed" or looked down upon "by middle and upper-class Americans."12 Young Joseph, in fact, was brought to trial in Bainbridge, New York, in 1826 as a "glass- looker," at which time various friends and associates were interrogated as to his per- sonal character.13 Joseph Jr.'s money-digging activity combined with the family's general poverty caused the Smiths to be socially snubbed by their more affluent, middle-class neighbors. The Smiths were forced to endure such humiliation even though, in the words of one commentator, they "were, on the whole, good, decent, hard-working people who should have fared better."14 Such ostracism apparently "took its greatest toll" on Joseph Jr. 's mother, Lucy Mack a "fiercely proud and socially ambitious" woman. Lucy, more- over, found the Smith family's chronic eco- nomic difficulties particularly galling, given that the Smiths and Macks were both of prominent New England stock. Ancestors on both sides of the family had "accumulated a substantial amount of property," and "achieved political distinction in state and local offices" in Massachusetts. However, the family's economic decline began with the migration to Vermont of Asael Smith, Joseph Jr.'s grandfather. This decline accelerated following the marriage of Lucy to Joseph Sr. in 1796. 13 12Hill, Quest for Refuge , 3. For the most detailed discussion of Joseph Smith's involve- ment with money digging and magic, generally, see D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View (Salt Lake City, 1987). 13Hill, Quest for Refuge , 1 1 . 14Winn, Exiles in a Land of Liberty, 1 1 . 15Ibid., 6-8. Within the Smith family, moreover, Joseph Sr. apparently failed to fulfill the traditional role of male patriarchal domi- nance. Joseph Sr.' s problems with alcohol might have been a contributing factor. What- ever the case, his wife Lucy assumed a "strong role" in overseeing family affairs, at least equal to that of Joseph Sr. "Assertive, proud, inclined to self-importance" Lucy according to one writer presented "an inter- esting contrast" to Joseph Sr., who was characterized as a "reticent" personality. Thus, Lucy and not Joseph Sr. was appar- ently "the greatest influence" on Joseph Jr. during the future Mormon leader's early years.16 Further overshadowing Joseph Sr. was Alvin, the oldest son. According to at least one observer, "It was he who worked the farm and was the mainstay of the family."17 Thus when Alvin suddenly died in November 1823 of complications resulting from bilious colic, the loss was profoundly felt. Joseph Jr. lamented the loss of his bro- ther, characterizing him "as the noblest of my father's family."18 Exacerbating all these difficulties was the Smith family's unsettled religious situa- tion. Long before Joseph Jr.'s birth, both of his grandfathers had broken away from the traditional churches of New England, despite 16Hill, Joseph Smith , 38. Another writer "expressed the opinion that Joseph's mother provided his motivation" in that she '"had the intellect' and spurred her son on with visions of his greatness." As quoted in Hill, Joseph Smith, 456, fn. 7.

By contrast, Joseph Jr. "was very saucy and insolent to his father" on at least one occasion, according to the statement of Issac Hale, his father-in-law, 20 March 1834, as con- tained in Brodie, No Man Knows My History , 439. 76</page><page sequence="5">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal their Puritan roots. Both grandfathers, how- ever, retained fervent religious beliefs, vari- ously millennialistic and mystical, but could find no home within various organized chur- ches.19 In turn, Joseph Sr. and Lucy also manifested "religious heterodoxy." Accord- ingly they both rejected the negative view of humanity evident in the Calvinistic tenets of New England Congregationalism. They believed, instead, that free will and one's own ability could influence his or her own salvation. Eschewing various established churches they embraced "Christian primitiv- ism" or a return to "true" Christianity as taught at the time of Jesus, believing that various innovations within the established churches down through the ages had cor- rupted the true faith.20 There were further complications when conflict developed within the Smith family over religious practice and belief when Lucy joined the Presbyterian Church following the family move to Palmyra. She was joined by two sons and one daughter.21 Other family members, however, held back, including her husband and young Joseph. The elder Smith, despite his own deeply held mystical, univer- salistic beliefs, steadfastly refused to join the Presbyterians or any other church, even in the face of his wife's persistent admoni- tions.22 It appears that Joseph Jr. "was dis- tressed by [this] religious conflict between his parents."23 Young Joseph responded by agreeing to attend church with his mother but "did not find the experience edifying."24 Further aggravating this situation, young Joseph, himself, was caught up in the reli- gious fervor of the Second Great Awakening affecting Palmyra and other parts of the "burned-over" district of western New York.25 As a result, a number of denomina- tions vied for his allegiance causing further inner turmoil. Joseph Jr. later confessed that "my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect and I felt some desire to be united with them." But he held back, adding: "So great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person as young as I was and so unacquainted with man and things to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. My mind ...was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were.. .great and incessant."26 Deeply troubled, Joseph Jr. sought divine guidance and in the wake of a "vision" was allegedly instructed to join none of the existing denominations.

Lucy's motives for taking the lead in trying to get her family to associate with a congregation at this particular time, given the smiths9 "religious traditioin of family hetero- doxy" is not completely clear. Winn has sug- gested that Lucy was caught up in "the religious fervor" of the Second Great Awakening and like other women of the time, "played the role of God's fifth column in this movement, subver-ting irreligion in the household." Perhaps, also, joining an established congregation would help in the Smith family's quest for social respectability. 22Ibid.

Smith, himself, assumed the title of "first elder" indicating "his preeminence over the whole church."28 Thus for Joseph Smith, this new denomination, ultimately known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or the Mormon church), resolved the sharp religious divisions within his own family while at the same time allaying his own deeply felt anxiety concerning the "true" source of religious authority.29 Joseph Smith, moreover, apparently hoped that revenue generated from sales of copies of the Book of Mormon would help ease his own family's chronic financial problems.30 The Book of Mormon, besides serving as the basis for this new and, in many ways, unique American religious denomination,31 can be viewed as a clarion call for radical reform, that is, the need to resolve the multi- tude of problems, political, economic, as well as social, plaguing American society during the antebellum period. Alexander Campbell in commenting on the Book of Mormon noted that Joseph Smith's work: decides all of the great con- troversies - infant baptism, ordination, the Trinity, regeneration, the fall of man, the atonement, transubstantiation, fast- ing, penance, church government, reli- gious experience, the call of the minis- try, the general resurrection, eternal punishment, who may be baptized, and even the questions of free masonry, republican government, and the rights of man.32 While Campbell was a less-than-sympathetic critic by virtue of his leadership within the rival Disciples of Christ (from which the Mormon church drew many of its early converts) he was perceptive in noting the deep concerns expressed in the Book of Mormon relative not just to specific reli- gious-sectarian issues, but also social, politi- cal, and economic problems which Campbell alluded to under the category of "republican government, and the rights of man." Thus the Book of Mormon can be viewed as a docu- ment of strong social-economic protest. According to one noted scholar of American religious history, "The single most striking theme in the Book of Mormon is that it is the rich, the proud, and the learned who find themselves in the hands of an angry God. Throughout the book, evil is most often depicted as the result of pride and worldli- ness that comes from economic success and 27What actually occurred relative to Joseph Jr.'s various "visions" and his subsequent writing or "transcription" of the Book of Mormon have been and continue to be topics of intense debate.

For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; where- fore, their treasure is their God. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also."34 In other places the rich found themselves under attack. Alma, a well-known Book of Mormon prophet condemned those who "persist in the wearing of costly apparel" and who set their "hearts upon the vain things of the world" He warned that if they "persist in turning [their] backs upon the poor and the needy they shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except they speedily repent."35 Lawyers along with merchants came under the sharpest attack as economic op- pressors. Also denounced were vain, learned clergymen more concerned about their own ornate clothing and general appearance than conditions of the poor and needy in their midst36 In general, the main focus of divine displeasure were "the interlocking themes of pride, wealth, learning, fine clothing, and oppression of the poor."37 By contrast, the Book of Mormon clearly identified with the plight of the poor and downtrodden. As for specific remedies, the Book of Mormon called for radical reform, a new religious-political order based on economic equality and communal cooperation. Smith's work lamented the current division of Ameri- can society "into classes."38 The "ideal" society was one in which "there should be equality among all men." There would be no idle people. All would labor "with their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want."39 The Book of Mormon described in glowing terms a "golden age" in which "every man did deal justly one with another" and during which "they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift."40 In general, the Book of Mormon was a critique of the "rampant exploitative individu- alism" that characterized the larger Ameri- can society during the Jacksonian period. Thus, it rejected the accepted norai or "ideal" of the "self-made man" who could achieve success through individual initiative. "The good of the community took prece- dence over individual self-interest."41 It has also been suggested that Smith's work had an "anti-capitalistic quality" to it.42 What- ever the case, the Book of Mormon "pro- jected a Utopian vision that challenged the political, economic, and social values of 33Nathan O.

This assertion has been echoed more recently by Marvin S. Hill, Quest for Refuge , 17, who qualified his use of the term by stating that such "anti-capitalism... had more to do with the divisive, pluralistic character of capitalism than to permanent ideological objections to it." R. Laurence Moore in Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans (New York, 1986) 42, suggests that Mormon "anti-capitalism" rested on opposition to 4 the atomistic individualism of a society that thrived on competition and conflict." 79</page><page sequence="8">Volume Fourteen 1994 antebellum America."43 It anticipated the ultimate destruction of "an old way of life" and the subsequent building of "a new social order from the ground up."44 The Book of Mormon found a ready audience, despite the radical tone of its basic message, or more precisely because of it, and the fledgling Mormon church grew rapidly. From some 280 converts at the end of 1 830, the movement more than doubled to over 680 within a year after Smith's own migra- tion from New York to the Midwest in 1831. At that time, two new Mormon settlements were formed: the first at Kirtland, Ohio, where Smith maintained his principal resi- dence with his wife, Emma Hale, whom he had courted and married in January 1827, and the second established in the then fron- tier community of Independence, Missouri. By 1835 total church membership stood at 8,835, a thirteen fold increase in just four years! And three years later, in 1838, this number had doubled to 17,881, with over 10,000 (a majority) living in Mormonismi principal gathering place of northwestern Missouri.45 The "earliest [Mormon] disciples" were "men and women of modest means and little education."46 "Most converts," noted one writer, "had a history of [geographic] mobil- ity, economic insecurity, dissatisfaction with contending sects and hope[d] for a millen- nium in which discord and hardship would be eliminated and status in the Lord's king- dom would depend upon spiritual rather than material values."47 In general, they were "characteristically poor, uprooted, un- schooled, and unsophisticated" like Joseph Smith, himself.48 Thus they not only respon- ded to the basic message contained in the Book of Mormon but also identified with the Mormon leader in terms of their own so- cial-economic backgrounds. For example, Brigham Young, who joined the Church in 1832 and would emerge as a principal Mormon leader, had been raised in such desperate poverty that his family was broken up when he was just fourteen in the wake of his mother's death in 1815. Leading a no- madic existence while living in various communities throughout upstate New York, Young tried with limited success to make a living variously as a carpenter, painter, and glazer prior to joining the Mormon move- ment.49 Young, like Smith, was "denied the 43Moore in Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans, 42. 44Foster, Religion and Sexuality , 143. In making this observation, Foster stands in opposition to the interpretation presented by Kenneth Winn in his Exiles in a Land of Liberty who argues that the primary objective of Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, and the Mormon movement was the restoration and perpetuation of American "republicanism" and the values within that ideology. This author tends to find Foster's basic assertions more convincing than those of Winn. 45 This according to "official" church statistics given in the Deserei News 1991-2 Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, 1990), 333.

As a result, Young "retained deep resentment against the social distinctions of the churches of his youth."50 Other notable Mormon leaders, including John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Heber C. Kimbell, Parley and Orson Pratt, came from similar back- grounds in that they were "poor farmers or artisans barely finding funds to meet their needs" prior to joining the church.51 Joseph Smith, moreover, possessed a number of striking personal qualities which aided him in commanding the allegiance of his followers. In his physical appearance, he was imposing, "muscular," standing six feet tall, and considered "very handsome, except for his nose, which was aquiline and promi- nent."52 According to one writer "he had remarkably blue and compelling eyes under heavy eyelashes, thick blond eyebrows, a high, slanting forehead and light auburn hair." His face "was sensitive" and "he looked at others directly, with an open and sympathetic interest" while possessing a smile that was "easy and warm."53 Although another account characterized his "gaze" as "veiled and slightly mysterious."54 Whatever the case, Smith's wife, Emma, was reported to have remarked that "no painting could catch his expression, which was always changing in reflection of his thoughts and feelings."55 In addition, Smith possessed a certain "charisma" particularly evident while speaking. He projected "intense feeling" according to one writer, in delivering ser- mons whereby "the blood drained from his face, leaving a frightening, almost luminous pallor."56 These varied qualities enabled Joseph Smith to command and hold the allegiance of his followers. As Mormon leader, Joseph Smith im- plemented certain practices in the spirit of reform manifested in the Book of Mormon while at the same time consolidating his own power or control over his followers. Smith promoted active, widespread participation by members of his church. "Exceedingly egali- tarian," in the words of one writer, the Mor- mons had "no professional clergy." Virtually all adult male members (but no females) were ordained to offices within the Mormon priesthood.57 Such egalitarianism was also evident in Mormon doctrine, in particular, Joseph Smith's assertion, through revelation, that virtually all humankind would be saved, even non-believers along with the wicked and unrighteous. Despite such a universal view, however, the "degrees of glory" in the hereafter would vary with the "highest de- grees" reserved to practitioners of the true faith, that is, Mormonism.58 Also providing greater opportunity for his followers, Smith established special positions of leadership for his most capable and loyal followers. These included an "assistant president" plus two counselors to aid him in running the Bringhurst, Brigham Young and the Expanding American Frontier (Boston, 1986) 1-24. 50As noted by Hatch, The Democratization of American Christianity, 121. 51As described by Marvin S.

In March 1835, Smith, through revelation, established himself as church president, or premier officer "over the whole church." The powers of this office were enhanced by Smith's designation as "seer, revelator, translator and prophet."60 Accordingly Smith made fre- quent use of personal revelations to instruct and direct his followers, which gave further divine sanction to his authority. Smith's published revelations appeared, first, in a Book of Commandments, brought forth in 1833, and two years later, in an expanded volume known as the Doctrine and Cove- nants. The latter work, ultimately canonized as holy scripture in 1 835, was upheld by the Mormons on a par with the Book of Mormon and the Old and New Testaments. In the meantime, Joseph Smith asserted his role as a reformer in another important way. In February 1831, he called for a new economic order. The Law of Consecration and Stewardship established in February 1831, through revelation, was "a prescrip- tion for transforming the highly individualis- tic economic order of Jacksonian America into a system characterized by economic equality, socialization of surplus incomes, freedom of enterprise, and group economic self-sufficiency."61 Members of the church were expected to "consecrate" or "deed" to the church all of their property. In turn, the church would then grant an "inheritance" or "stewardship" to every family out of the properties so received. It was hoped and expected that the consecrations would ex- ceed the stewardships. Out of this surplus the church would then grant stewardships to poorer and younger members of the church.62 The Law of Consecration and Steward- ship was designed as a "leveler" to bring about a condition of relative temporal equal- ity among church members. It was in the spirit of the "ideal" egalitarian society sug- gested in the Book of Mormon and further described in a later revelation given by Jo- seph Smith. The Mormon leader proclaimed, "It is not given that one man should possess that which is above another, wherefore the world lieth in sin."63 Smith's effort paralleled the attempts by other groups of antebellum Americans to implement their own forms of economic communitarianism, in particular the Shakers under Ann Lee and the followers of Robert Dale Owen at New Harmony. The Mormon system, however, was less all- inclusive or in the words of one writer, "more aliken to farm tenancy than to the true communal agriculture practiced by the Shak- ers and New Harmonists."64 The Mormon system "aimed at equality in consumption" rather than equality "in the capital controlled or managed by individuals." Individuals "were to be given responsibilities propor- tionate to their need, circumstances, and capacities."65 As one writer has suggested, "The spirit of true Marxian com- munism - 'from each according to his abil- ity, to each according to his need' - was implicit in the whole system."66 Despite the relative moderation of the Mormon Law of Consecration and Steward- 59Ibid., 104:1 lb-18 (107:22-40, LDS). «Ibid., 104:42 (107:91-92, LDS). 61 Leonard J.

Smith and other leaders could persuade "only about half' of those church members living in Independence, Missouri, to participate in the program "and those [doing so] almost invariably [were] the poorer."67 Further upsetting Mormon efforts was the forced expulsion from Independence of those Latter-day Saints living in that com- munity during the summer of 1 833 by hostile non-Mormons leery of not just Mormon communitarianism but of the Mormons, generally.68 A significant amount of Missouri anti- Mormon hostility stemmed from anxiety concerning Latter-day Saint views on the issue of black slavery - rapidly emerging as the most critical issue among antebellum reformers. Joseph Smith and his followers assumed a basic antislavery position.69 The expression of Mormon antislavery attitudes is not surprising given that Smith along with the vast majority of his Latter-day Saint followers were from nonslaveholding regions of the northeast. Reflecting this attitude, the Book of Mormon condemned human bond- age in general, despite its concurrent and seemingly contradictory racist concepts, that is, a belief that the Indians' dark skin was related to their degraded condition and the product of unrighteous behavior.70 Joseph Smith, moreover, expressed his own deep anxieties relative to the disruptive potential of black slavery in American soci- ety in response to the 1832-33 South Caro- lina secession crisis. Through a 25 Decem- ber 1832 revelation, destined to become one of the most famous in Mormon canon, Smith predicted that numerous wars would "shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina." In time "the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States" and war ultimately spread to "all nations." Even more ominous, black slaves would be involved in these apocalyptic events: "And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disci- plined for war."71 Such cataclysmic expecta- tions clearly fit in with basic Mormon millennialistic beliefs. 67Hill, Joseph Smith, 149. Grodie, No Man Knows My History, 140, has suggested that "Missouri had particularly resented the communistic nature of the Mormon settlement" in Nauvoo. In a manifesto drawn up by local Missouri settlers in Independence the Mormons were described as "deluded fanatics or weak and designing knaves... in claiming revelations direct from heaven, especially that God had given them this country for an in- heritance." Other causes for the Mormons' expulsion from Jackson County included non- Mormon suspicions concerning Mormon attitudes toward the Indians as well as toward black slavery. For an account of the circumstances surrounding the expulsion of the Mormons from Missouri see Warren A. Jennings, "Factors in the Destruction of the Mormon Press in Missouri, 1833," Utah Historical Quarterly , 35, Winter 1967, 56-76. ^'Newell G. Bringhurst, Saints, Slaves, and Blacks contains an extensive discussion of such attitudes. See: especially, 3-83. 70Book of Mormon, Alma 15:10 (27:9, LDS).

Discussion of Book of Mormon racist concepts are particularly evident in I Nephi 3:134 (1 Nephi 12:23 LDS) and D Nephi 4:33-35 (2 Nephi 5:21-24 LDS) where certain individuals are cursed with a "skin of blackness" and the Lamanites become "a dark and loathsome, and a filthy people full of idleness and all manner of abomination." Although this same work holds out the possibility of ultimate redmption whereby the descendents of the Lamanites, the present-day Indians would lose "their scales of darkness" and become "a white and delightsome people" provided they become "civilized" and adopt the true faith of Mormon-ism.

It stated: "So long as we [the Latter-day Saints] have no special rule in the church as to people of color, let pru- dence guide...." It concluded, "in connection with the wonderful events of this age much is doing towards abolishing slavery and colo- nizing the blacks in Africa."72 Non-Mormon Missouri reaction to this article was swift and violent. Combined with their perceived suspicions of the Mormons generally, this newspaper article triggered the Latter-day Saints' forced removal from Jackson County, Missouri, in 1833.73 Mormon antislavery views were, moreover, a significant factor in the complete expulsion of all Latter-day Saints from Missouri some five years later in the wake of organized mob violence sanc- tioned by the states' governor and other officials. The so-called Mormon Missouri War of 1 838-9 culminated in Joseph Smith's own near execution and six-month confine- ment in the Liberty County jail.74 Despite their violent expulsion from Missouri, Smith and his followers continued to express gen- eral antislavery views over the course of the next five years. Although they remained aloof from, and indeed, condemned the actions of militant abolitionists such as Wil- liam Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Weld, Fred- erick Douglass, and others. Smith and his followers, moreover, carefully distinguished their own views from those of various anti- slavery organizations including the American Colonization Society and the American Anti-slavery Society.75 Joseph Smith showed himself to be an antebellum reformer in other ways, particu- larly following the Mormon migration to and settlement of Nauvoo, Illinois, the Mormons' primary gathering place after 1839. Smith personally directed the Mormon migration to Nauvoo, which by the mid- 1840s boasted some 12,000 residents, making it the second largest city in the entire state.76 In addition to his role as religious leader, Smith took charge of both economic and political affairs within the burgeoning city. In promoting the city's economy, Smith did not formally re- institute the recently abandoned Law of Consecration and Stewardship.77 But he did encourage close, economic cooperation among his followers in developing local farming, the mainstay of the Mormon's economy, along with various mercantile and commercial enterprises. To further this end he directed establishment of the Nauvoo Agricultural and Mechanical Association in 1841. 78 nEvening and Morning Star, July, 1833. ^Jennings, 'Tactors in the Destruction of the Mormon Press in Missouri, 1833," 56-76. 74Stephen C.

Flanders, Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi (Urbana, Illionis, 1965) is a good starting point in seeking an understanding of this important period. 77Although Joseph Smith had through revelation attempted a revival of the Law of Consecration and Stewardship in modified form in 1838 during the Mormon sojourn, it was soon abandoned. One aspect of this effort was retained, the so-called "law of tithing" whereby church members were required to pay a tithe or a tenth "of all their interest annually." Doctrine and Covenants 106 (119, LDS), 120, LDS (not in RLDS Doctrine and Covenants). 78Flanders, Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi , 144-178 discusses such activities. See 48-55 for a description of the formation of 84</page><page sequence="13">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Politically, Nauvoo secured what one writer has labeled "a quasi-sovereign govern- ment," thanks to a liberal city charter secured by Smith from the state government of Illi- nois. This charter gave the city council power to "make, ordain, establish and exe- cute all such ordinances not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States or of this state." It made the city's mayor a particu- larly powerful figure, granting him legisla- tive, executive, as well as judicial author- ity - the latter, by virtue of the mayor's concurrent position as chief justice of the municipal court.79 The charter, moreover, allowed Smith and his followers to organize and maintain their own armed force. Nomi- nally a part of the Illinois state militia, the Nauvoo Legion, consisting of every able- bodied male resident between eighteen and thirty-five, came to number "some five thou- sand men" by 1 844.80 This military organiza- tion was the result of Smith's deep concern for the safety of his followers in the wake of the Mormons' brutal, bloody expulsion from Missouri - an act sanctioned, and indeed, carried out by local and state officials.81 Joseph Smith, himself, exercised signifi- cant political and military power due to his membership on the Nauvoo City Council, and ultimately his role as the city's mayor, plus his office as commander or lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion. He used his authority to promote certain reforms. The city allowed no saloons or public drinking establishments, a situation in sharp contrast to other frontier communities. If citizens of Nauvoo wanted to drink, they were required to buy their alcohol from a shop specifically licensed for this purpose and to consume it in the privacy of their own homes.82 This en- forcement of public temperance was in the spirit of the Mormon Word of Wisdom. Based on a revelation given by Joseph Smith in February 1833 during the Mormon so- journ in Kirtland, Ohio, the Word of Wisdom called for abstinence from "wine or strong drink" proclaiming them "not good ... for the belly."83 Joseph Smith's call for Mormon abstinence took place during a time when a rising tide of temperance agitation culmi- nated in the rise of the so-called "Cold Water Army," and was most evident in the forma- tion of some five thousand temperance soci- eties by 1834.84 Similarly, the Nauvoo City Council enacted a strong anti-vagrancy ordinance directed against idle persons and others who could not "give a good account of themselves." Such individuals were subject to a $500 fine and a six-month jail sentence. The council even sought to limit public the Nauvoo Agricultural and Mechanical Association, various laborers' cooperative industries, along with the organization of pro- ducers and consumers' cooperatives over the next five years. 79Ibid., 98-99. 80This figure was given by Hill in Joseph Smith , 97.

For a recent discussion of temperance reform within the context of American society at large, see Joseph Gusfield in Symbolic Crusade : Status Politics and the American Temperance Movement. It should be noted that the "Word of Wisdom" also called for a prohibition on the consumption of tobacco noting that "tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man;" as well as "sparing use" of the "flesh... of beasts and of the fowls of the air." By contrast "All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life." Doctrine and Covenants 86: 2b-c (89: 12-14, LDS). Smith's admonitions, calling for the limited consumption of animal flesh and fowl were not unlike the recommen- dations concurrently being promoted by such American dietary reformers as Sylvester Graham. 85</page><page sequence="14">Volume Fourteen 1994 utterances of "profane and indecent lan- guage."85 In another move to enforce public morality, Joseph Smith, along with other members of the Nauvoo City Council, acted against the proprietors of a local brothel when news of its operation came to their attention in October 1842. The city council pronounced the brothel a "public nuisance" and ordered a detachment of the Nauvoo Legion to demolish the building in which this enterprise was located.86 On a more elevated level, Joseph Smith acting as Mormon church leader, concerned himself with various other issues affecting women. A fundamental issue involved the proper role and place of women within the church. The church manifested a definite male, patriarchal orientation evident from its earliest days and reflected in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. In the words of one scholar who has carefully examined these two works, both conveyed the stark assumption that "women are insignificant - or at least less significant than men."87 Accordingly, the Book of Mormon referred to only six women by name, in sharp contrast to the hundreds of men so men- tioned - a logical situation given this work's primary focus on relationships within male- dominated societies.88 Similarly, the Doctrine and Covenants was "generally addressed to 'men' or assumed an all-male audience."89 It gave minimal attention to women, referring to them a mere five times in contrast to the mention of men, by name, over 400 times!90 The limited role allowed women within the church is nowhere more evident than in the fact that women were not allowed ordina- tion to church priesthood offices.91 This restriction held even though women, from the earliest days of the Mormon movement, manifested what has been characterized as two special spiritual gifts, the ability to heal the sick through blessings or prayer, and the gift of speaking in tongues.92 Also, during the Mormon sojourn in Kirtland, a female mem- ber of the church named Hubble "professed to be a prophetess of the Lord.. .and had many revelations" in affirming the truthful- ness of the Book of Mormon.93 In upholding a strong male, patriarchal role within his movement, Smith was appar- ently influenced by two basic factors: first, it is possible that Smith was reacting against his childhood environment within his own family, where his mother, Lucy, a strong, dominant individual, had exerted an influ- ence, at least equaling and perhaps exceed- ing that of his father. Joseph Sr., by contrast seemed a weaker or more benign figure. Second, Smith might have been responding to what one author has termed "the feminiza- 85Brodie, No Man Knows My History , 269. *Tbid., 268-9. 87 As noted by Melodie Moench Charles, "Precedents for Mormon Women from Scriptures," 45, 49; in Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective , eds., Maureen Ursenbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Anderson (Urbana, Illinois, 1987).

Newell also notes "a remarkable prophecy" given by Elizabeth Ann Whitney "concerning the Indians on 10 October 1833. Smith, however, reacted against the actions of women such as Hubble. His concern was evident in a February 1831 revelation in which "none other" than Joseph Smith "appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations."

Mormon females, in particular married women, be- came more assertive apparently as the result of increased responsibilities within their families - a consequence of the absence of their husbands. A large number of Mormon males left their families in response to calls by church authorities to serve as missionar- ies, leaving their wives primarily responsible for their families.95 Pressure from such in- creasingly independent and assertive Mor- mon women culminated in the formation of the Relief Society in March 1842. Some 1,341 women involved themselves in this new organization, a number representing 10 to 1 5 percent of Nauvoo's Mormon popula- tion. These women chose as their first presi- dent none other than Emma Smith, the strong-willed wife of Joseph Smith!96 The major announced objectives of the Relief Society were "to seek out and relieve the distressed" and "to watch over the mor- als - and be very careful of the character and 94 Ann Douglas, in The Feminization of American Culture (New York, 1977) discusses this important development. According to Douglas, 97, "the nineteenth century minister moved in a world of women. He preached constantly to women; he administered what sacraments he performed largely for women; he worked not only for them but with them, in mission and charity work of all kinds." 95As suggested by Jill Mulvay Derr in "Making of Mormon Sisterhood," in Beecher and Anderson, eds., Sisters in Spirit , 156-8. ^ïbid., 158. The standard work dealing with Joseph Smith's first wife, Emma, is Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery, Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith (New York, 1984). reputation of [its] members." In seeking "to house the homeless and provide work for widows" and help other dependent people, the Relief Society's role was similar to that of numerous other contemporary women's auxiliaries and benevolent and reform societ- ies throughout the United States. Such orga- nizations by the 1840s numbered in the thousands.97 Relief Society activities, moreover, soon expanded into the spiritual realm. In fact, Joseph Smith's own assertive mother, Lucy, suggested that "the organization could pro- vide the opportunity for women to refresh each other spiritually" Thus members of the organization engaged in testimony bearing, gospel instruction, and occasionally spoke in tongues. More important, Joseph Smith, himself, apparently granted the Relief Soci- ety additional powers. Smith characterized this organization as "a select Society... a kingdom of priests as in Enoch's day" to whom "the keys of the kingdom are about to be given." He further stated that the officers in the organization, Emma Smith and her two counselors, were "not only set apart, but ordained" to "administer to the sick and comfort the sorrowful." According to another account, "several other sisters were also ordained and set apart to administer in these holy ordinances."98 These allusions to "priests," "keys" to be given, and "ordina- tions," has caused some writers to suggest that Joseph Smith was on the verge of grant- ing Mormon women the powers, if not the actual offices, of the Mormon priesthood. The suggestion that Joseph Smith was about to move in such a radical direction, has emerged as a sharp point of debate among certain writers as well as spokespersons 97As noted by Derr, "Making of Mormon Sisterhood," 158. Keith E. Melder, Beginnings of Sisterhood : The American Woman 's Rights Movement, 1800-1850 , examines this develop- ment within the larger American society. 98Newell in "Gifts of the Spirit: Women's Share," in Beecher and Anderson, eds., Sisters in Spirit, 115. 87</page><page sequence="16">Volume Fourteen 1994 within the Mormon church." Ultimately, however, the whole issue of the Mormon priesthood vis a vis the Relief Society be- came moot with the formal disbanding of the womens' organization in 1 844 just two years after its formation. This move came in reac- tion to attacks by certain Relief Society members to the still secret but highly contro- versial practice of Mormon polygamy.100 Indeed, Joseph Smith's introduction of polygamy to a small, select group of follow- ers in 1841 followed by its divine sanction- ing through revelation on 12 July 1843, represents the Mormon leader's most radical effort to "reform" or alter the role of women within the basic structure of the family.101 Smith's sanctioning of plural marriage ap- pears to be a bold departure, running counter to his earlier teachings in the Book of Mor- mon, which contained five separate denunci- ations of polygamy, linking this practice with "fornication," "whoredoms," and various problems of family disorganization.102 But, in fact, Joseph Smith began to move away from his initial monogamous position shortly after publication of the Book of Mormon. In July 1831 Smith apparently suggested that plural marriage would be introduced at some future date.103 It also appears that Joseph Smith, himself, may have taken at least one plural wife as early as the mid- 1830s while still living in Kirt- land. 104 But it was not until 1 84 1 that Joseph Smith unveiled the practice of plural mar- riage to a small group of his most trusted followers, including Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball.105 The precise number of women taken as plural wives by each of Smith's close associates was "very re- stricted" usually numbering just "two or three."106 By contrast, Joseph Smith took unto himself a considerably larger number of women, despite strong protests and opposi- tion from his first wife, Emma. The precise number of women who became Smith's plural wives is difficult to determine, with varied estimates ranging from twenty-seven all the way up to eighty- four! 107 Joseph Smith's precise motives for implementing plural marriage are difficult to determine. On a doctrinal level, Smith's introduction of this extremely controversial practice represents a critical stage in the evolution of Mormon theology. Through a series of important revelations and various statements given between 1841 and 1844, Smith introduced a number of significant doctrinal concepts, including the introduction of sacred, secret temple ceremonies, as essential for complete Mormon salvation, along with several revolutionary concepts concerning the nature of God and human- kind's own relationship to the supernatural.

In promoting the latter concept, Smith asserted the existence of numerous divine beings throughout the total expanse of the universe. Smith, moreover, preached an even more radical concept that humans currently living upon the earth had the potential to become "gods" ultimately assuming dominion over worlds of their own through a process known as "eternal progression." Ultimate godhood, however, could be secured only though the strict adherence to various Mormon ordi- nances and practices, including plural mar- riage. Indeed, the practice of plural marriage would serve as an effective means for faithful Mormon males to produce the largest possi- ble number of offspring to be subject to his exalted godlike authority in the hereafter.108 Joseph Smith in introducing plural marriage was apparently also influenced by an antebellum American society experienc- ing profound social change. One scholar has suggested that Mormon polygamy repre- sented "an attempt to restore earlier patriar- chal patterns in marriage" currently under attack. "At the deepest level [Mormon polyg- amy] was a fundamental protest against the careless individualism of romantic love, which seemed to threaten the very roots of family life and social solidarity."109 Smith, perhaps, was also influenced by one addi- tional factor: the prevalence of various forms of marital experimentation, particularly evident among various groups in the upstate New York environment where he had grown up. These ranged from the Shaker religion directed by Ann Lee which preached com- plete sexual abstinence with male and female members living completely separate from each other, to the Oneida Community under John Humphrey Noyes which preached "complex marriage, "a practice that involved ia8Ibid., 143-4, 179. 109Ibid., 139. sexual relations with multiple partners.110 In sharp contrast to the secrecy sur- rounding the introduction of plural marriage, Joseph Smith was very open in promoting himself as a reform candidate for president of the United States in 1 844. Rejecting the two major parties, Smith ran as an Independent. But at the same time he adopted a broad- based reform platform clearly influenced by the two major parties, the Whigs and the Democrats, and the small, but highly visible Liberty Party. Echoing the Whigs, the Mor- mon leader called for the reestablishment of the national bank. Smith also expressed ardent expansionist views not unlike those of the Democratic Party under the leadership of James K. Polk. Thus Smith opposed British claims to Oregon, advocated the annexation of Texas and, if it could be arranged peace- fully, annexation of both Canada and Mexico as well. Like the reformist, antislavery Lib- erty Party, Smith called for abolition of black slavery. This would be accomplished through gradual, compensated emancipation with revenues gained from the sale of public land. Three additional reforms not on the agendas of the existing political parties included prison reform whereby virtually all imprisoned convicts would be freed, a call for a reduction in the size of the United States Congress by half and reduction in its pay, and a proposal that the President of the United States be given authority to suppress mobs and protect the constitutional rights of all citizens, irrespective of the wishes of any state governor.111 To direct his campaign, Joseph Smith utilized a newly created political organiza- tion, the Council of Fifty. While separate and distinct from the Mormon church, the council 110As with his discussion of the Mormons, Lawrence Foster's, Religion and Sexuality, 21-122, represents the most scholarly discussion of the marital practices of these two groups. mJoseph Smith's platform with an intro- duction by Richard D.

This organization dispatched more than three hundred spoksmen throughout the United States who organized dozens of political rallies in major cities in the East and the Midwest.112 Expressing confidence of ultimate victory, Smith and his backers talked about building "a coalition of the oppressed" including, interestingly enough, American Catholics who like the Mormons were a despised religious minority and vic- tims of persistent antebellum mob vio- lence.113 What success Smith would have achieved in the political arena will never be known. The Mormon leader was killed by an armed mob on 27 June 1844 while impris- oned at Carthage, Illinois. Smith's arrest and subsequent death came at the end of a chain of events stemming from Smith's introduc- tion of plural marriage. This practice had generated increasing controversy within the church as more and more Latter-day Saints became aware of its existence. By June 1 844 a group of Mormon dissidents had com- pletely broken away from Joseph Smith, denouncing him as a "fallen prophet." They formed their own organization, and com- menced publication of their own newspaper, The Nauvoo Expositor , which openly at- tacked Joseph Smith and plural marriage. In response, Smith acting in his capacity as Nauvoo's mayor, had the newspaper de- clared a "public nuisance" and ordered destruction of the press along with all avail- able copies of the newspaper. Smith, how- ever, quickly realized the explosive situation caused by this clear violation of basic First Amendment rights. Thus, he agreed to be taken into custody and stand trial on the charges brought against him. Smith did this li2Klaus J.

But Smith's arrest was not enough to prevent his own death at the hands of a well-organized mob composed of local citizens unwilling to let the legal process take its course.114 In conclusion, Joseph Smith and the early Mormon movement reflected many aspects of the reform impulse which charac- terized American society during the antebel- lum period. This was evident in Smith's advocacy of such reforms as temperance, prison reform, and the abolition of slavery. But such proposals were minor parts of a much larger reform program whereby Joseph Smith and his followers envisioned the cre- ation of an entirely new social and economic order to be built on the ruins of what they felt to be a fundamentally corrupt and decadent American society tottering on the edge of imminent collapse.115 Mormon communi- taiianism and the practice of plural marriage would be important, essential components in hastening the creation of this "new heaven and new earth." Indeed, the Latter-day Saints as reflected in their name, believed the mil- lennium and second coming to be imminent. While the radical new society envisioned by Joseph Smith and his early followers did not come to pass, the Mormon movement or Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which numbered some 26,000 members at the time of Smith's death in 1 844, has grown to well over seven million members in the early 1990s. An ironic consequence of this growth is that the present-day Mormon 114Dallin H. Oakes and Marvin S.
