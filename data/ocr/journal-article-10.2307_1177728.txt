<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore Research in Communist China* By CHUN-CHIANG YEN INTRODUCTION The study of Communist folklore, especially that of Russia and Communist China, has not been fully evaluated.1 The present study proposes to examine the folklore research achieved in Communist China since 1949. A preliminary account will be given of the introduction of the science of folklore from Europe to China, and folklore activities during the 1920's and 1930's to enable the reader to compare the theories of the pioneer students of Chinese folklore and folklore workers in contemporary China * This material derives from a seminar paper which was presented in partial fulfillment of the Master's degree at Harvard University. I express my gratitude to Professor Francis Woodman Cleaves for en- couragement and many valuable suggestions. I also avail myself of this opportunity to thank the Harvard-Yenching Institute for the financial aid which made the present research possible. The data were originally collected for a manuscript which I prepared under the direction of Professor Richard M. Dorson and submitted on July 27, 1964 as first draft for a Master's thesis at Indiana University. 1. Five articles deal in some length with the ideology of Com- munist folklore: Richard M.

Pre-Communist China Folklore Activities (from 1918 on) 1. Folklore introduced to China as a science in the field of ethnology. The collecting of modern Chinese materials started with the Folksong Collecting Bureau (Ko-yao cheng-chi ch'u 1j;~ ftA) organized in the National Peking University in 1918. Folklore as a science was not, however, generally recognized in China for almost another decade. In 1926 Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei V5iF (1867-1940), then director of the Academia Sinica at Nanking, made the following remarks: Min tsu hsiieh Kt- is a branch of learning which examines the cultures of peoples so as to further the descriptive or com- parative studies [of the cultures-trans.]... But in German the singular form for Volkerkunde is Volkskunde which comes from the English word Folklore. This English term was created by W. J. Thomas [sic] in 1846 to replace the term Popular antiquities...3 For the first time min-tsu-hsiieh in the sense of "Volker- kunde" was seriously understood in China as a disciplined science. Min-tsu-hsiieh, as indicated above, is a concept modeled after the European school of folklore. In defining "Vergleichende Volkerkunde" as meaning that "which samples the data on be- havioral patterns of ethnological groups to compare their simi- larities and dissimilarities," Ts'ai referred to such works of Western scholars as Garrick Mallery's Picture-Writing of the American Indians, Karl Groos' The Play of Man, Heinrich Schurtz's Grundriss einer Entstehungsgeschichte des Geldes, and 2. Unless otherwise indicated the translations of citations from the writings of these students and workers are my own. Also I should like to note that since neither all Communist simplified Chinese characters nor all standard Chinese characters are available in Japan, in certain cases Japanese "kanji" A ("Chinese characters") had to be used. 3. Cf. "Shuo min-tsu-hsiieh # S; ," Ts'ai Yiian-p'ei min-tsu- hsiieh lun-chu t.C.:@i~ (ed. Chung-kuo min-tsu-hsiieh hui 4t1S ~-;t^ ), Taipei: Chung-hua shu-chii rp J, 1962), p. 1. The term "Volkskunde," it may be observed, seems to have been used as early as 1806. Cf. Ake Hultkrantz, General Ethnological Concepts (Inter- national Dictionary of Regional European Ethnology and Folklore, Vol. I), Rosenkilde and Bagger, Copenhagen, 1960, pp. 139 and 243. 2</page><page sequence="3">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA Richard Andree's Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche.4 Meanwhile, Ts'ai treated folklore of Chinese origin on a par with that of European and, in most cases, referred to Chinese folklore as older. For instance, he wrote: The ethnographic study of min-tsu-hsiieh [i.e., Beschreibende Volkerkunde-trans.] originated early enough. In China we have the Shan-hai ching IiS;M [The Book of Mountains and Seas], a book written in the pre-Han period. This book, though it deals with geography and abounds in materials of ancient mythology, offers a fairly rich account of min-tsu-hsiieh.5 He pointed out further that "although the tendency to include min-tsu-hsiieh in anthropology seems to be possible...now that the study between the dissimilarities and similarities of the cul- tures of peoples has beei more accentuated.. .min-tsu-hsiieh has long since become independent of anthropology."6 Min-tsu-hsileh, as Ts'ai defined it, is affiliated with cultural history, sociology, psychology, linguistics, geography, fine arts, literature and, of course, anthropology, archeology, and ethnology. From the above remarks it is evident that at the very outset min-tsu-hsiieh showed the influence of European scholars, particularly F. Ratzel, E. B. Tylor, F. Graebner, W. Schmidt, and G. E. Smith. No less unmistakable is that, even at this early stage, nationalism played a predominant role in the study of folklore in China; and that was inevitable, insofar as Chinese cultural background is concerned. 2. Folklore research in the Academia Sinica As a result of Ts'ai's remarks on min-tsu-hsiieh proposals were made to establish a center for advanced studies, including folklore research. On November 20, 1927, the Academia Sinica, with its Research Institutes, was organized.7 At first, speculation over the distinction between folklore and ethnology was incon- clusive.

However, pursuant to a later decision, folklore research of an anthropological nature with an emphasis on folk nar- ratives and customs was carried on by the Research Institute of History and Philology (Li-shih yii-yen yen-chiu-suo K Sr-' pff established in 1928); and research of an ethnological nature remained in the Social Sciences division. The Academia, with Ts'ai Yiian-p'ei as Chairman, conducted some remarkable work. In the field related to folklore research, for instance, under the direction of Ts'ai, anthropologists and experts were sent out to the Yao and Miao tribes in Kuangsi, to the aborigines in Formosa, to the Goldi people in the Northeast (Tung-pei jt1, Manchuria), to the Li's in Hai-nan tao, and to the Yi's in Yiinnan to carry out fieldwork. Several reports on this fieldwork were published.8 Ts'ai also proposed to establish a folklore museum. As a result Dr. T. W. Dantzel was invited to China in 1932 to help establish a national folklore museum.9 A detailed plan was drafted. Unfortunately, owing to financial and other problems, Dr. Dantzel's design had to be shelved. From 1934 on, min- tsu-hsiieh and anthropology (a research unit developed later) were incorporated into the Research Institute of History and 8. For example, cf.

It should be noted that the field- work undertaken during this period was strictly limited to the field of ethnology. Oral narratives remained largely an unmined source. 3. Early Western pioneer folklore collectors in China Up to the Literary Revolution in 1917-1918, according to the prevailing tao #8 ("code of ethics"), intellectuals regarded oral narratives which circulated in the vernacular with contempt. Attempts to collect these narratives from oral tradition were out of the question. However, the tao did not affect the Westerners in China who saw in Chinese folksongs "the true feelings of the people," and regarded colloquial tales as belonging "undoubtless- ly to the folklore."10 A few Westerners made what may be considered pioneer collections of oral songs, tales, and proverbs based on fieldwork. In 1888, Arthur Henderson Smith (1845- 1932) published in Shanghai Proverbs and Common Sayings from the Chinese, a collection of Chinese proverbs with detailed Eng- lish annotations. Baron G. A. Vitale published in Peking in 1896 his Pekingese Rhymes, a volume of one hundred and seventy songs in Chinese with notes and translations in English. The Rhymes was followed by his Chinese Merry Tales (1901), a collection of ninety-nine humorous tales written in Mandarin. Isaac Taylor Headland (1859-1942) heard most of his songs from nurse-maids, collected some one hundred and fifty, and trans- lated and published them in Chinese and English parallel texts in his Chinese Mother Goose (1900).1n These pioneer collec- tions, though they suffered from being localized in the Peking areas, were first-hand folklore materials taken directly from the oral tradition. They provided landmarks which the Chinese folklore workers sought to follow some twenty years later. 4.

After May Fourth, pai hua bj, or the "vernacular" became the medium for mass com- munication; old tradition, the tao and its imitations were defied. Interest in a plain-speaking and expressive literature of the people was brought to public notice. As mentioned earlier, the Ko-yao cheng-chi ch'u, organized in 1918, began a series of "Selected Folk-songs" in the Peking University Daily (Pei-ta jih-k'an 1Lz kE ilJ, from the end of May 1918 to May Fourth 1919). In 1920 a Folk-song Research Society (Ko-yao yen-chiu-hui 3kft%) was founded. In 1922 the Society was reorganized as a research unit in the Institute of Sinology at Peking Univer- sity. Professor Chou Tsou-jen )Mf'FA was appointed chairman of the Society to resume the work of collecting. As of June, 1925, the songs collected totaled 13,339 of which 2,226 were published in the Folk-song Weekly (Ko-yao chou-k'an Wti:J). Besides folksongs, other notable contributions included proverbs, legends, folktales, and marriage customs.l2 The Weekly appeared in December, 1922; it was discontinued during 1926-1935 and re- continued in 1936.13 But after only one year the Sino-Japanese War brought an abrupt end to the Weekly. lla.

Folklore research in South China and the political con- flicts between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Com- munist Party Prior to the Japanese invasion of China in 1931, the National Sun Yat-sen University (Kuo-li Chung-shan ta-hsiieh Hg fi l1 Ak, Kuangtung University, Kuang-tung ta-hsiieh )f;Xt until 1927) in Canton had gradually attracted public attention as a folklore research center in south China. Canton, the first citadel of Western interest and politically the seat of the Kuomintang, provided for Kuang-tung University an environment characteristic of the National Revolution (Pei-fa 1Lft, or the Second Northern Expedition) of 1926-27. New ideas were being shaped. Communism was tolerated for the campaign against the northern warlords. Active reformers such as Kuo Mo-jo Xq^ and Lu Hsiin H, (Chou Shu-jen XnkA) were on the faculty of the University. Literature, as proclaimed by Kuo Mo-jo, then Dean of the College of Arts (1926), must be "expressive of sympathy with the proletariat, socialistic, and realistic."l4 Lu Hsiin succeeded Kuo as acting dean for only a few months (January-August, 1927), when the Communist- Kuomintang split of 1927 occurred. Radical reformers were re- moved from the Sun Yat-sen University. Professor Fu Ssu-nien tgfi?f, formerly one of the student leaders of Peking University in the May Fourth Movement, became director of the Institute of History and Philology (August, 1927) at the Sun Yat-sen University. It was in this Institute that a folklore research project, similar to that of the Research Institute of History and Philology in the Academic Sinica, was initiated. The Institute was incorporated with several other activities such as the Folklore Society (Min-su hsiieh-hui Eitl , 1927), Show Room of Folklore Objects (Feng-su wu-p'ien ch'en-lieh-shih )N ,,DAIJ_, 1928), and a folklore program offering general and related courses in folklore (1928). The Folklore Weekly (Min-su ~I{), edited by Chung Ching-wen MA:t, was the communication organ for folklore scholars.15 14. Cf. Kuo Mo-jo Ja "Ke-ming yii wen-hsiieh m~T~," Mo-jo wen-chi iS;I , Vol. X, Peking: Jen-min wen-hsi.eh ch'u-pan-she A f-ti ha , 1959, p. 323. 15. Chao Wei-pang, "Modern Chinese Folklore Investigation," Folklore Studies, Vol. II (1943), pp. 81-83. 7</page><page sequence="8">CHUN-CHIANG YEN The folklore project in south China was characterized by a challenge in both subject matter and discipline. For one thing, the research was no longer limited to folksongs, which almost monopolized the pages of the Folk-song Weekly of Peking Univer- sity; instead, riddles, legends, folktales, gods and deities became the focus of interest. Secondly, a desire for depth and breadth rather than mere collection for collection's sake now manifested itself.16 And thirdly, by 1928, the science of folklore was clearly recognized as a necessary academic program in higher education in China. The Kuomintang-Communist split of 1927 created great tension in south China, especially in the Sun Yat-sen University. Within two years some of the pioneer folklore workers parted with the Folklore Society. Ku Chieh-kang ~lIJ, formerly a member of the Folk-song Research Society at Peking University and in 1928 director of the Institute of History and Philology at Sun Yat-sen University, left in 1929. Chung Ching-wen, editor of the Folklore Weekly, and Ch'ien Nan-yang AiX , a member of the Folklore Society, found their way to Hangchow where they joined Lou Tzu-k'uang :TF and started a Chinese Folklore Society (1930). Publications by the Society included Collections of Folklore Studies (Min-su-hsiieh chi chien R{f-t), and Folk Monthly (Min-chien yiieh-k'an 1jJ f{lJ).17 Meanwhile, as the Chinese Communist Party was outlawed, Mao Tze-tung and his men fought their way out from the Hunan-Kiangsi-Kuangtung border regions (1927-1934) and launched their historical "Long March" in 1934-35. The "Long March" covered eleven provinces, crossing the aboriginal zones of the Chuang's and Yi's, the land of the Lolo's, and the Kansu area of the Hui's. By October 1935, they reached their destination, the Shensi base in the Northwest. 16. Chao Wei-pang lists a number of books which were included in a certain Folklore Series published by the Folklore Society of the National Sun Yat-sen University; for example, there were the transla- tion of List of Types of Indo-European Folk-tales ["Some Types of Indo- European Folk-tales," based on Charlotte S. Burne, "Applendix C," Handbook of Folklore, London, 1914] by Yang Ch'eng-chih tTH~j, Discus- sions of the Tale Meng-kiang-ni (Meng-chiang-nii ku-shih t'ao-lun chi 4S;i~]j^ ) by Ku Chieh-kang, Superstitions and Legends (Mi- hsin yii ch'uan-shuo ;-~,f=) by Jung Chao-tsu V]ofi, Talks on Folk- tales by Chao Ching-shen &amp;f0i~ and so on.

Again, with the Japanese encroachment in China's Northeast (Tung-pei) beginning in September 1931, security in North China was threatened. When China finally declared war with Japan in 1937, all government-owned institutions and universities had to move their posts from north, central, and south China to the Southwest. There in Chungking, the war-time capital in the Szechuan Province, the Folksong-Proverb Society (Yao-yen hsiieh-hui )i=| ) was established (1941); and also the Folk- song-Proverb Collecting Bureau (Yao-yen ts'ai-chi ch'u =i t) under the Board of Education (Chiao-yii-pu -Wff, 1941).19 The Sino-Japanese war, concluded in August 15, 1945, was fol- lowed by the civil war from 1945 to 1949, resulting in the Kuomin- tang's withdrawal from mainland China to Taiwan (Formosa). A folklore research institute was set up in the Academia Sinica in Taiwan.20 In Communist China, folklore research has been carried on by the Research Society of Chinese Folk Literature and Arts (Chung-kuo min-chien wen-i yen-chiu-hui ~p9 S;~r~ ~), an organ established in February 1950. Folklore research, as directed by the Chinese Communist Party, has deviated from the main tendencies of folklore research in the West. II. The Early Period of Communist Folklore (from 1930 on) 1. Folklore used as military and educational materials in the Communist area. The Chinese Communist use of folklore for political purposes may be traced back to the 1930's. Within their mountain hideout, 18. Cf. Edgar Snow, Red Star Over China, New York: Random House, Inc., 1938, pp. 182-184; see also, The Long March, Eyewitness Accounts (ed.

As a result, the study of folklore activities for this period is dealt with briefly in this paper. 9</page><page sequence="10">CHUN-CHIANG YEN the Communists sought to build up an army against their enemy, the Kuomintang. Mao's small battalion of workers and peasants, which he led from the Hunan Province, was formed from a group of five to six hundred bandits. Later, other combat units led by Chu Te ., and P'eng Te-huai ,, at Ching-kang-shan RJijU on the Hunan and Kiangsi border, joined them. There at Ching-kang-shan Mao disciplined the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.21 Mao's legions grew to ten thousand known as the Hung-chiin rt~ or, the Red Army, since 1928. Living on limited resources with a ragged and hungry army to feed,22 the Red chiefs reckoned on certain tactics to solve their problem: (1) to maraud the enemy's service corps, food supplies and rations, and (2) to confiscate the holdings and moneys of the bullies and landlords.23 Thus, in January 1929, the Reds broke through the Kuomintang blockade, moved south- eastward to the Kiangsi-Fukien borders, and established their base at Jui-chin 4l in Kiangsi. In December 1929, a conference was held in Ku-t'ien W3, Fukien, in which Mao laid down the principles and rules for "building up the Party and the Army." Also discussed were the methods for developing art and literature "to meet the neces- sities of rallying mass struggles, of winning the masses over from the enemy's side."24 So, as demanded by the Party, revolutionary tales and folksongs were to be propagated among the soldiers; "flower-drum song singing" (ta-hua-ku fTTE) ), drama per- formances and other games were to be encouraged.25 The Central 21.

And whenever occasion allowed, whether it was a show or a revolu- tionary folksong singing, the performance was always directed in such a way as to "keep close cooperation with what was to be the Government's essential mission."26 For instance, in the so-called "enlarge the Red Army to a million movement," re- volutionary folksongs resounded: Ai ya lai! Enlarge a million, iron Red Army, Red Army of chivalric renown, The fifth "campaign" will be ruined anon, Sister comrades, Kiangsi victory will soon be won! Ai ya lai!

Lu Hsin, himself a writer critical of social and political decadence, who left Canton in the autumn of 1927 for Shanghai, became an immediate object of Communist search, as an asset to their political campaign, i.e., to "(let) the proletarian contest in a war of the compatriots-the class struggle, in order to obtain an out- and-out emancipation for mankind."28 On March 2, 1930, the Chinese Left-wing Writers League (Chung-kuo tso-i tso-chia lien-meng 'X~i i~) was established. The League proposed that "art must be against the feudal class, against the capitalist class"; that "...'a Marxism-literature-theory-research-society ("Ma-k'e-ssu-chu-i wen-i li-lun yen-chiu-hui o% ,_q,-^r~ f )")' ' ...

Communist folklore after the "Long March." From 1930 on, the Communists were mainly engaged in war with Chiang Kai-shek. Folklore activities, other than for propa- ganda use, were eliminated for the time being. And by the spring of 1933, Chiang had waged four of his major "Campaigns for the Extermination of Bandits (i.e., Communists)" without success. It was Chiang's fifth "Campaign," however, that had forced the Communists to plan their Long March. With the termination of the Long March in northwestern China, the Communists under- took to outwit the Kuomintang strategically with the result that Chiang's final "Campaign for the Extermination of Bandits" eventuated in an overall anti-Japanese war.31 Folklore activities in the period of the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) were associated with three coalitions, represented by the North China puppet regime, Nationalist China in the south- west, and the Communist base in the northwest.

The north- western group, headquartered at Yenan, embraced the Party- directed activities and theories with which the present study is concerned. In the Northwest, as elsewhere in North China, Ch'in-ch'iang }~E (a kind of folk-drama peculiar to the area), story-telling, folksongs and plantation songs (yang-ko ekS, or "seedling songs") were the common forms of entertainment. The content of the narrations, especially that of ch'in-ch'iang and story-telling, con- sisted of sagas, legends, and popular fiction of old tradition, some of which, in the eyes of the Communists, "bear strong color of feudalistic consciousness," are "corrupt" and "of low taste." A gradual implantation of Communist elements was in process. Modern drama and playlets with themes of anti-Nipponism, and the people's revolution occupied the audience.33 New story- telling themes praising "good things of the new society" took the place of the old.34 Revolutionary and anti-Japanese folksongs went hand in hand with the traditional folksongs. Plantation songs combined with country dance struck one observer as being "an-all-talking-singing-dancing poor man's opera."35 After Mao publicized his "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Art and Literature"36 (1942) with the main idea that art and literature should focus on the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Party sent experts in art and literature, or rather, the so-called wen- kung t'uan ~FIC ("culture [mission] working team") to the 32.

Folklore utilized in the "War for People's Liberation" (1945-49). The "popularization" of art and literature is governed by a single dogma: the majority of the masses are illiterate, and need "culture, knowledge, art and literature...which are readily acceptable to them...."37 On that account the wen-kung t'uan had a unique mission: to educate the masses, technically utilizing story-telling, ballad-singing, yang-ko, and other suitable forms. However, as it was also Mao's contention that "art and literature are subordinate to politics,"38 the wen-kung t'uan, in addition, were sent on a political errand: to arouse class consciousness, a preparation necessary for the "people's liberation." The wen- kung t'uan worked to considerable effect. With the spread of the "agrarian reform movement" in and out of the Communist areas, the wen-kung t'uan cadres entered into the milieu of the masses, and collected yang-ko plays, poor man's drama, "drum lyrics" (ku-tz'u MAP), "quick rhymes" (k'uai-pan ft ) recited by the peasants, workers, and soldiers, some of which were published under government auspices.39 Meanwhile, the Communists lost no time in imposing upon the people the ideology with reference to Chiang Kai-shek that "the war he started is a counter-revolu- tionary war directed by U.S. imperialism against the inde- pendence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people."40 There was no alternative but to "overthrow the dic- tatorial Chiang Kai-shek government." Chiang's fall was in- evitable. With the unification of China making collecting work all over China possible for the first time, the Communist manipu- lation of folklore developed a new intensity. 37.

Folklore Research in Communist China Folklore studies in contemporary Communist China fall into two major fields: (1) textual research, which includes studies on the origin, history, commentary, and verification in the broad field or in a specific genre of folklore; and (2) fieldwork, i.e., collecting various oral genres from different peoples. Inspection of the works produced shows that research of the first kind, whether it be the effort of an individual or a team, presents orderly handling of documents, minute references, and un- mistakable originality, while that of the second group, being primarily intended for the "propagation of new art and literature of the peoples under socialism," functions, in that sense, in build- ing up collections which await further scientific treatment, such as motif indexing. 1. Textual research A. Deity belief and mytholgy Textual research originated with scholars soundly trained in the Chinese classics. Generally speaking, the materials they dealt with came from classical sources. Some works that were completed before 1949 saw republication after the Communists came to power. Wen I-to (1899-1946), for instance, in his "Shen- hsien k'ao tWl,ll,41 investigated the origin and conceptual process of deity belief in China. Tracing the ethnologic origin of the Ch'i r people from the west part of China where cremation rituals prevailed, quoting a verse by Mo Tzu X:-, he affirmed that crema- tion signified the transfer of the soul from the present life to eternity. Developing this idea Wen maintained (pp. 156 and 161) that: ...The immortality of the soul is premised on the existence of a "futurity"...where the soul abides and rejoices eternally. Again, because of a prejudiced conception that the [relationship between- trans.] things is antithetic, [men-trans.] regard soul and flesh as being opposed to, and interfering with, each other; therefore they 41.

This book first appeared as "Chia-chi Shen-hua yii-shih Fp _j-t ," in Wen I-to ch'iian-chi X-^^k , Vol. I, Shanghai: K'ai-ming shu-tien fJlA S 1948. 15</page><page sequence="16">CHUN-CHIANG YEN also think that, unless the flesh perishes completely, nothing can be done with the emancipation of soul; hence, the ceremonial custom of cremation takes its rise. ...If man can rise to heaven, he, like the gods, will become immortal, almighty, and joyful in all happiness. Because there are so many advantages after man's rising to heaven, to live cannot be better than to die. Therefore, the state of being alive is the means by which mortalness can be reached. The living flesh is temporal; the soul that is left after death is eternal; the temporal is a false- hood; the eternal, the truth... As viewed in this light, deity is a kind of theistic ideal... Since all men can be transformed into deities, belief in deities arises from the principles of equality. Further, he pointed out that the character "hsien" 11 or "immortal" was originally derived from the characterfg, also pronounced as hsien, of which the right-side radical ~ means "go- ing up high" and the left-side radical &lt; , a "human being."42 Research on mythology has hardly begun in Communist China where there is a tendency to infuse it with ideological terminology. Men like Yuan K'o JiJ claim that mythology "ought to be interpreted in terms of labor." So, in his Chung- kuo ku-tai shen-hua 4B-SftjE~ (The Mythology of Ancient China),43 Yuan contents that in the beginning of the universe, "labor creates men.. .and all the gods that were praised were the laboring heroes of ancient times."44 In the Communist works on mythology, Western scholarship or achievements are seldom referred to. Definitions regarding myths appear to be tentative. Thus, narrations dealing with the events of the anthropomorphic beings are defined as belonging to the realm of legends (ch'uan- shuo fS-), while fables of great antiquity are called mythology. The difference between legends and myths is explained by the fact that the former, following the advance of civilization, grad- ually rejected the savage elements of the latter; instead, legends acquired the outlook of a sophisticated and humane mind; and the deities were further personified, gods and heroes became intertwined, and history and mythology were mixed up. Hence, 42. Wen I-to, Shen-hua yii shih, pp. 160-161. 43. Yuan K'o iP, Chung-kuo ku-tai sheng-hua rptftrt=J, Shang- hai: Shang-wu yin-shu-kuan ~, 1954.

For instance, the reasons that cause the creation of myths are analyzed as follows (pp. 1-2): In primitive man's world, there was...no separation of daytime and night-time, nor distinction of waking from dreaming. The events [he encountered] in daytime sometimes appeared in a dis- guised dress in his dreams, changing into all kinds of wonders. Awakening with a recollection still obscure, [he] thought these wonders were the vision he had experienced. When narrated over and over again, various kinds of myths were brought into being. In primeval times, the immaturity and obscurity of language was also an important cause in the rise of myths. The organs of sound of human beings could not have been skilfully fashioned; further- more, the vocabularies and idioms must have been simple and in- sufficient. In order to let others understand, primitive man must make his ideas a show accompanied with exaggerated gesticulation of hands and feet. Things thus exaggerated lost sight of their original truth and eventuated into myths. B.. Folktales and folksongs The invention and spread of folk tales and songs have long been issues for folklorist debates. Despite decades of debates, it has never been clear whether folk tales and songs were in- vented independently in centers of different geographical areas or spread presumably from one single origin to various locations via borrowing and transmission. Chinese literary men such as Cheng Chen-to ,gfK (1897-1958) raised similar issues and proposed a comparative study of origins and transmissions of specific folklore genres. Cheng gave two examples as bases for comparative study: (1) the tale about King Solomon-his judg- ment over a lawsuit between two women, each of whom claimed to be the mother of a baby, and the tale about the wisdom of Pao Cheng (fl. 1056) over a similar lawsuit;46 and (2) the tale of "Real Friendship" contained in the Gesta Romanorum, and 45.

Yet, Cheng's methods involve using European tale samples, whose contents are viewed as contradicting the Communist Party's ideology. The Brief History of Storytelling (Shuo-shu hsiao-shih d'J^ 5) by Ch'en Ju-heng &amp;rf appeared in 1936. Twenty years later, with further materials on hand, Ch'en rewrote the book under the title History of Storytelling (Shuo-shu shih-hua ll^ ) . The author gives evidence of sources showing that the earliest record of storytelling is traceable to the T'ang dynasty (A.D. 618-906). Thereupon, he took theories that the storytelling tradition had started with the Buddhist monks of the mid-T'ang dynasty who preached religious scriptures through "tell-singing" (chiang-ch'ang ,Hp) in the vicinities of monaste- ries;48 later on, storytelling was no longer a privilege of the monks alone; professional storytellers appeared among the townsmen; stories of a religious nature gave way to sentimental romances and laid the foundation of storytelling for generations to come.49 Further, Ch'en aims at detailing different styles of storytelling from the T'ang on down to the Ch'ing dynasty, as well as the lives of great storytellers and highlights of some of the tales told.

His Chinese Folksongs (Chung- kuo ko-yao r4'Akff), a series of lectures on folksongs delivered for the students of Chinese literature at Ch'ing Hua University (since 1929), demonstrates his comprehensive views on the study of folksongs from different approaches. First, on terminology, he says rnin-ko JS is seemingly a translation of "folksong, or people's song" from English. However, he thinks that ko-yao RtiS is a more suitable term in that it carries the connotation of "folksong, or people's song." As for "ballads," which are very rarely encountered in the realm of Chinese ko-yao, he suggests following Louise Pound's phrase of "romantic narrative songs."50 For that reason he prefers to use shu-ch'ing-ti hsii-shih tuan-ko E'[bflM,QT. S as an equivalent of "ballad." On the definition of folksongs, Chu frankly admits that "although we have had an exact comprehension of folksongs since 1913, when the Peking University started to collect folksongs,...yet...it seems that we are still in want of exact definitions about folksongs."51 In his opinion, it is better to refer to materials from abroad. He cites Frank Kidson's conception of folksongs as being "song and melody born of the people and used by the people as an expression of their emotions and (as in the case of historical ballads) for lyrical narrative,"52 and formulates (page 6) in his own words the definition of min-ko: Folksong (min-ko) is that which expresses an event, a legend, or a feeling in a perceptible form through an individual; that which is generally understandable and perceivable in the midst of the folk. Yet very few people can make it a fixed model. To further his idea that the min-ko rests on no "fixed model," he cites Louise Pound's Poetic Origins and the Ballad, p. 202: ...All types of songs are folksongs, for the literary historian, which fulfill two tests. The people must like them and sing them- 50. Chu Tzu-ch'ing X n f, Chung-kuo ko-yao B,gS, Peking: Tso- chia ch'u-pan-she fftthW , 1957, pp. 7-8.

They must have achieved an existence not dependent upon a printed original. On the origin and development of ko-yao, Chu sums up the pan-Western arguments advanced by Frank Kidson and, par- ticularly, Rose Adelaide Witham and Louise Pound. He con- cludes that all except Pound hold to the belief that ballad is the earliest form of folk-poetry. But insofar as the ballad itself is concerned, Chu is of the opinion of Pound that it is a late-comer.53 He mentions that it was Professor R. D. Jameson who in his "Comparative Folklore Methodological Notes" introduced the Finnish School of the Historical-geographical Method to Chinese students, saying that Kaarle Krohn's Die Folkloristische Arbeits- methode (1926) could be applied to researches in tales, myths, legends, songs, games, riddles, creeds and customs.54 Chu's Chinese Folksongs, though not completed as he wished,55 is a recommendable work. The spirit of the work lies in Chu's impartiality. He tries to present a critical view of folk- songs from Chinese sources; meanwhile, he introduces as much as he can of what he knows about folksongs in Western thought. The first Communist research that deals with folksongs of a specific period in Chinese history is the Yileh-fu Songs and Folksongs from the Six Dynasties (Liu-ch'ao yiieh-fu yii min-ko 53.

Chu's work was supposed to include ten sections in the follow- ing order: definitions of folksongs; the origin and development, the history, the classification, the structure, the rhetoric, the evaluation, the research method, the history of collecting, and the bibliography of folk- songs.

The areas of the origin and diffusion of these songs are suggested in commentaries based on an analysis of historical documents. Unlike that of most other specialists, Wang's emphasis lies in determining the author- ship of folksongs and poetry and in clarifying ambiguities. C. Folk drama and puppet shows Chinese folk drama is believed to have developed more or less from religious festivals. The Odes of Chou (Chou sung ),i5), which are believed to have flourished in the early Chou dynasty between the 11th and 12th centuries B.C., are generally regarded as having the earliest reflections of religious per- formances in which music, singing, and dancing took place.57 But records of later periods make a systematic historical study of Chinese folk drama a field still not quite free from contro- versies. "The Shaping and Developing of Chinese Drama" ("Chung-kuo hsi-chii ti hsing-ch'eng ho fa-chan ggIIJj^l]r M%") by Chou I-pai )Mft notes that "the basic factor that determines the art of drama is the representation of stories."5 The earliest story performance given in Chou's article is one of the variety shows of the Han dynasty known as chileh-ti 2ft. As Chou quotes: There was a man of the Eastern Sea [called] Huang the elder- ly. While young he engaged in magic; he could control snakes and tigers. Girded with a red-metal sword, with a band of red silk about his locks, when standing he was able to bring forth clouds and haze; when seated he was able to make mountains and rivers. When he was growing weak and old, [his] strength failing, and having over-indulged in wine, he was no longer capable of practis- ing his magic. Toward the end of Ch'in, there appeared a white 56.

Huang the elderly, then by means of his red-metal sword, went to repress it. Since his magic was of no avail, he was killed by the tiger. Tradition made a theatrical per- formance out of this [event]. A Han Emperor also made a chiieh-ti theatrical performance out of it.59 To antedate the entity of chiieh-ti Chou quotes The Western Capital (Hsi-ching fu iAS) by Chang Heng a (A.D. 78-139) in which chileh-ti was mentioned.60 Chou interprets, then, the performance of the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" story as one determined by a plot which requires that "Huang of the Eastern Sea" be killed by the tiger (a person in disguise). He regards, therefore, the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" performance as a starting point in the history of the formation of Chinese drama. He concludes that the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" was a satire on the shamans; that it is certainly not the shamans who played the role of Huang. And he says that the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" was a folk-legend (min-chien ch'uan-shuo kR'fiS); it was first adopted as a "story representation" and afterwards as a chiieh-ti show by Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. Also, Chou be- lieves that the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" was a legend popular in the areas of the Eastern Sea; Huang was not a native of the Western Border Region (Hsi-yii iA); hence the performance it- self was not influenced by the plays of an alien country, such as those of India, for example.61 In regard to Chou's arguments, it will be helpful in the present study, as it would have been in Chou's article, to discuss some historical facts. We recall that folk legends about the Eastern Sea ("Tung-hai" i:g) were very popular in the Ch'in- Han period and that according to one of the most striking ones the First Emperor (Ch'in Shih-huang ~t~) (259-210 B.C.) sent 3,000 virgin males and the same number of virgin females, led by Hsu Fu tir, to the Eastern Sea to seek the elixir vitae.62 The mere mention of "Tung-hai" in the "Huang of the Eastern Sea" episode does not necessarily lead to a solution such as Chou reached. Again, a closer examination of Chou's quotation and several original texts (Hsi-ching tsa-chi ~Gg) shows in- dubitable proof that Chou deliberately avoided quoting the San-fu 59. Ibid., p. 10. 60.

By the above references I have attempted to show that, how- ever Chou may argue, a historical study of Chinese drama is still a field arousing controversies. Sun K'ai-ti * in On the Origins of the Puppet Show (K'uei-lei-hsi k'ao-yiian {ffciAR ), first written in 1944 and revised in 1952, cleaves to the belief that the puppet show originated with ancient funeral ceremonies. In The Rites of Chou (Chou li ]l)L), it says that the fang-hsiang-shih fftkE , an official attendant wearing a prodigious, ugly-looking effigy, marched in front of the funeral procession to dispel the evil spirits. The performance of this fang-hsiang was, in Sun's opinion, a type of dancing play. Sun mentions that, in the Han dynasty, the popular funeral minstrelsy was k'uei-lei !I ("prodigious figures") which was a new term for fang-hsiang; that in Em- peror Ling's (e) time (168-189) k'uei-lei was even entertain- ment for the courtiers as a dancing play.65 At present, numerous treatises and works on general and local Chinese dramas are pouring out. A number of works shows that there seems to have been a tendency to specialize in Chinese drama as it developed from the folk tradition. But the research in general has focused on relating drama to the history of 63.

It can also be seen how the ideal of the Literary Revolution-to create a plain-speaking and expressive literature of the people-has, with the infusion of Communist ideology, come to be "expressive of sympathies with proletarian socialist-realism"; that the propagation of the proletarian litera- ture, as proposed by Ch'i Ch'iu-pai, is to be achieved by utilizing storytelling and ballad-singing. Then there follows the "brigand- age" period of Mao and the Long March. Having this chronology in mind, we shall not find it difficult to anticipate what folklore materials are to be collected, what are the major areas of in- terests, where collections have been initiated, and what have been the purpose of collecting folklore materials. A. Collecting projects subordinated to Party control Since all folklore actvities are regulated by the Party, the initiation of a collecting project takes place through a certain pro- cess. It is usually the propaganda bureau of a provincial administ- rative committee which initiates the collecting program by notify- ing another local organization such as the sub-division of the Cen- tral Academy of Ethnological Studies (Chung-yang min-tsu-hsiieh yiian ke-sheng fen-yiian r;- ~t' ), or a branch unit of the Chinese Writers Association (Chung-kuo tso-chia hsieh-hui ke-sheng fen-hui N ,#i+$ZiE). Any such local organiza- tion, on being informed of its "mission"-for instance, to collect tales or any other folklore genres of a given ethnic group- begins to mobilize whole regiments of workers to form a field- work team. For example, in 1958, the Yunnan Provincial Propa- ganda Bureau and the Branch Unit of the Chinese Writers Association initiated a project to collect folklore materials among the minority ethnic groups in Yiinnan Province. The fieldwork team, consisting of 115 Party radicals, teachers and students of local advanced schools, plus one hundred and some translators, was sent to Ta-li ( Tk), Te-hung ('), and Hsi-shuang- pan-na (WAKFi) to work among the Pai ( ), T'ai (B, Na-hsi 24</page><page sequence="25">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA (MlS), Yi ($), Chuang (f), Miao, and Ha-ni (~JE) minorities.66 The target areas of the collectors could be the people's com- munes, the workers' places, or the Fukien frontier stations. The team members were reminded that, wherever they went, they were in no wise to be a hindrance to the workers' work but to help them in all possible ways. In other words, their mission not only aimed at collecting but also at stirring up the spirit of the people at work so that more productivity could be expected. However, individual collecting does occur; in that case it is usually the editor of a local newspaper who writes an editorial reiterating the need for a general collecting movement. But even then the Party tune is apparent. Take, for example, an editorial written in the Ssu-ch'uan sen-lin pao EJ)[Ift[ (Szechuan Forest Daily) on January 10th, 1959: ... an exquisite piece of folktale usually circulates from genera- tion to generation... Its characteristics lie in the fact that through the details of the story a highly concentrated reflection on the labor- ing people's thinking and feeling is revealed: their hatred, their likes; their opposition and their pursuit... Before the Liberation, many 'people...fought against three big enemies [the Japanese invaders, the Chiang Kai-shek clique of Nationalists, and the U.S. supporters of Chang-trans.] and toiled with their own labor to create a fortunate prospect for the future... Many of the touching revolutionary folktales are in urgent need of collecting, classifying, and editing. For this reason we think that the notification from the Provincial Propaganda Bureau that everybody take a part in collecting folktales is timely, necessary, and should be resolutely and thoroughly executed. B.. Materials already collected-folksongs, legends, folktales For the most part the working team collects all genres of folklore. But in cases where a special mission is designated, as, for instance, the Great Leap Forward Folksongs Collecting Movement in 1958, the collecting would be confined to a par- ticular genre. Notwithstanding this, published sources show that the major genres of folklore collected are folksongs, folktales, and oral narrative poems (from the minorities). In subject matter, both the songs and tales aim at wiping 66.

They are, in other aspects, designed for putting into practice Communist China's economic and political campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward Program of economic develop- ment, and for fostering the resentments imposed upon the people against all "imperialists." Naturally there are endless versions of folksongs about the people's "working spirit," "mobilization for the great leap forward," "great leap forward in the people's communes," "great leap in steel foundry," "mining workers in the great leap forward," "building the water dam," "Long March," and so on. Folksongs of this kind were published in Hung-ch'i ko-yao (t&amp;I.Rffi) which also has an English edition entitled Songs of the Red Flag.67 Folksongs of the old tradition were still collected in the early issues (prior to 1958) of a monthly called Folk-Literature (Min-chien wen-hsiieh 3rpjf-Z) which has been continuing publishing collected folksongs, folktales, folk narratives, and essays on folklore since April 1955.68 The folk- tales which permit greater flexibility of narration, cover a broader scope. There are tales about the origins of the traditional Chinese festivals, fairy legends, tales about local customs and historical remains (all in the earlier issues of Min-chien wen-hsiieh), allegorical fables, stories for children; tales about miners, anti- Japanese legends, the people's revolutionary legends, and legends about Chairman Mao, Liu Shao-ch'i, and Chu Teh.69 A collec- tion of folktales containing 124 stories collected from 30 ethnic groups was published in the Selected Chinese Folktales (Chung- kuo min-chien ku-shih hsiiun iB$-i) in 1958. The col- lection consists of stories about the creation of the universe; the moon and the creation of her satellites, the moon goddess and the laureate tree; tales of the Mongolian "cowboy" and the heroic adventures of his steed; the young Uighur fifer and his triumph over the landlord who suppressed the poor; the praising 67.

The materials collected from these areas constitute what may be called the folklore of the minority peoples in contemporary China. 3. Folklore of the minority peoples in China A. Introduction Within the reaches of the border regions in China there are fifty-one ethnic minority groups whose population totals some 35,500,000. Most of these peoples dwell in the plateaus and mountainous regions covering an area of about 60 per cent of China proper.72 The areas, though compartmented into five major Autonomous Regions known as the Inner-Mongolia, the Sinkiang- Uighur, the Tibet-Chamdo, the Kwangsi-Chuang, and the Ning sia-Hui, are politically unified under the Republic. With the exception of a few, such as the Sinkiang-Uighurs, the Mongols, the Tibetans, and the Yi's (#), most of the minority peoples have no written language. The folk-literature of the minorities has been preserved solely through oral tradition. With a view to "preserving the cultures" of these autonomous regions, ever since the Liberation, the Party has shown a keen and eager interest in folklore collecting activities, especially among the Chuang's in Kwangsi which borders North Vietnam; the Yi's and T'ai's in Yuinnan which has borders with North Vietnam, Laos, and Burma; the Tibetans in Tibet adjacent to Nepal and India; the Uighurs in Sinkiang, a region rich in strategic mining materials, which borders on Russia; the Mongols in Inner Mon- golia adjoining the Soviet satellite Mongolia People's Republic; and the Yen-pien Autonomous Region in Kirin which is adjacent to Korea. The first measure undertaken was to have cadres trained bi-lingually in the branch institutes of the Central Academy of Ethnological Studies in these Auonomous Regions. It was reported that in 1963 there were over 200 students who, after two years hard study of the Uighur language in Sinkiang, completed their language training at Urumchi (Wu-lu-m'u-ch'i 72. This figure is based on Yang Liang-ts'ai ;t4 , "Feng-fu to-ts'ai ti shao-shu min-tsu min-chien wen-hsi)eh ~~bS]/~];JI t rA- ," Min-chien wen-hsiieh (September, 1959), p. 115. 28</page><page sequence="29">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA ,I,t r), .K'e-shih (94t) and Yili (fQJ-) respectively. These students, before they came to Sinkiang, were high school grad- uates selected from T'ang-shan JiLI, Pao-ting ~i (both in Ho-pei Province) and Peking, the areas where the standard national language, Mandarin, is spoken. Now with the language facility acquired they can freely express their thinking and feeling and read current books and newspapers with readiness.73 Another report noted that in 1964 there were over 8,000 linguistics workers in the Mongolian language in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.74 In due time, when a motion for collecting is made, the trained members are immediately available for fieldwork as translators. The fieldwork project that has been carried on in the autonomous regions has been extensive both in scope and dura- tion of time. The previously mentioned Yiinnan working team investigated the folklore of seven minority groups. After six months, the total number of items collected ran up to more than 100,000. In the meantime, the Propaganda Bureau of the Pro- vincial Government of Ch'ing-hai Province mobilized over 350 people from provincial literary organizations to explore the folk- lore resources among the Sa-la (4i?t) people, the T'u (-) people and the Tibetans.75 The Investigation Group on the Social History of Ethnological Studies in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Chung-kuo k'o-hsiieh-yiian min-tsu-yen-chiu-suo Kuang-hsi-shao-shu-min-tsu she-hui li-shih tiao-ch'a-tsu F_Jf4@ lR~:?,?^fi lAS/'^a~ ItSAf) has even carried on the sociological studies of several groups for seven years. The in- vestigation has been described as "systematic and well planned." In the course of the investigation, the authorities concerned have published Synopses on the Kwangsi Minority Ethnic Groups (Kuang-hsi shao-shu-min-tsu chien-chieh B/'t.ffik). The materials collected include historical remains of cultural and material value, tablet-inscriptions, copies and originals of archives holdings, folksongs and ballads, wall engravings, and relics of the Stone Age.76 With a fairly adequate grasp of the folklore materials collected from the minorities, and cooperating with each of the working teams in Yinnan, Kweichow, Szechuan, 73.

Folksongs and folktales of the minority peoples In the field of folksongs and folktales, the collection has been fruitful, if not qualitatively successful. The most ostentatious work is Folksongs of the Minority Peoples of China (Chung-kuo shao-shu-min-tsu ko-yao IEt1ftS'J ). It includes 3,511 texts of songs edited and selected by the Research Institute of the Linguistics of the Minority Peoples of the Academy of Sciences.78 Other collections of favored folksongs also see publication in local and central newspapers and periodicals; a number of them is published under special collections such as Selected Folksongs of Eastern Mongolia (Tung-meng min-ko hsiian KiJ^ ), Collection of Folksongs of the Pai People (Pai-tsu min-kou chi b&amp;JX ) , Songs of the Na-hsi People (Na-hsi-tsu ti ko ,A- PBk), Folksongs of the Tibetans (Tsang-tsu min-ko a&amp;~R c), Selected Folksongs of the Chuang People (Chuang-tsu min-ko hsiian chi {~tW., ), Selected Songs of the Yao People (Yao-ko hsiian chi AgR ), Selected Folksongs of the T'u-chia People (T'u-chia-tsu ko-yao hsiian ?fiKg . ).79 Folktales, like folksongs, insofar as their narrative content is concerned, can provide immediate tools for propaganda. Tales may be propagated to effect a consolidation between culturally different peoples, especially the Han majority and the various minority peoples; and to elevate the cultural level of the minori- ties. In consequence of these political and educational aims, the collecting of folktales is encouraged. The Selected Chinese Folktales, referred to earlier in this section, is a collection of 121 tales of which 45 are collected from the Han people and the rest from 29 ethnic groups such as the Mongols, the Hui's (the Mohammedans), the Uighurs ffi , the Miao's ,, the Li's ~, the Yi's, the Chuang's. A special edition of animal tales was published in 1962 in the Collection of Chinese Animal Tales (Chung-kuo tung-wu ku-shih chi ^ggi ;g:). These 93 tales were selected from those already published in magazines and 77. Cf. Yang Liang-ts'ai, op. cit., p. 116. 78. Lao She, op. cit., pp. 15-16. 79.

The animals speak in impersonated speech, one outwiting the other, while the tales end on moral notes. In this respect the selection as a whole is devoid of Communist propaganda.80 The fieldwork team in Yiinnan since 1958 has collected several times in the aboriginal areas. As a result of their collecting, they processed part of the collected folklore and contributed 101 tales in the Selected Folktales from the Ethnic Groups of Yiinnan (Yiin-nan ko-tsu min-chien ku-shih hsiian ~; ~F's'iB^' ).81 A few of these tales have been translated by Wolfram Eberhard and published in the Folktales of China (University of Chicago Press, 1965). There are several other volumes of selected tales from the minorities, such as Folktales of the Uighurs (Wei-wu-erh-tsu min-chien ku-shih fffi&amp;r i-mT), Collection of Legendary Tales of the Pai People (Pai-tsu ch'uan-shuo ku-shih chi btRfdr. ), Folktales of Tibet (Hsi-tsang min-chien ku-shi 4rjI)J. ), and Folktales of the T'ung People (T'ung-tsu min-chien ku-shih ti&amp;r m &amp;t) .82 A pre-Communist linguistic study of the Yiinnan Yi tribes contains ten tales with transcription of texts from the Yi language and provides Chinese translations. This research, car- ried out by Kao Hua-nien AA#+, has provided a key work for linguists and folklorists for speculative studies on comparative linguistics as well as source work for the study of the Yi language.83 C.

Chinese Communists and the rise of bandit-lore The beginning and development of the "People's Revolution" in many aspects resembled the traditional banditary revolts in China. Facing a militarily superior Kuomintang force, the Reds had to resort to bandits as army reinforcements. Their means of feeding the army was "to take from the rich," to maraud the enemy's service corps. Swearing blood brotherhood, they safely marched through the areas of the Yi and Lolo tribes. Now it is the Communists who reign over China. They must think of some solution to justify their historical past. The solution is: "All dark forces which endanger the masses of the people must be exposed while all revolutionary struggles of the masses must be praised."90 So, for the first time in modern China, all historical records about bandits are screened for re-examination. In the first place, peasant revolts, from the late Han dynasty down to the late Ch'ing dynasty, are discussed. Critical appraisals are rendered of the failures and merits of the people's revolts. In each case the conclusion reached is usually the same: "Peasantry revolts of the Chinese people were tremendous. The revolt activities were made in the disguise of religion. But without the guidance 89. In the A-hsi-jen ti ko ]bitt (see note 84 above), for in- stance, as a punishment of men's covetousness, the God of the Universe set atop a huge tree a yellow bird whose wings, covering up the sun- light, shadowed the earth with darkness. Later, the heat of the sun burned the bird to death. Its body became corrupt and turned into mountains; its wings fell piece by piece to the ground and changed into mud. So the sunlight shines upon the earth again. The original idea of this episode was: after the death of the bird, the flies laid eggs on it and the eggs of the flies turned into maggots which ate up the corpse of the bird (op. cit., pp. 23-24; 26-27; 27, note 1). 90. Mao Tse-tung, "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Art and litera- ture," Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. IV, p. 87. 34</page><page sequence="35">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA of an elite the revolts were doomed to failure."91 In this manner the Communists justify their responsibility for the cause of the "people's revolution." Secondly, all the official records about "righteous revolts (ch'i i igS)" such as those of the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties are being sorted and published without reserva- tion, insofar as the contents are concerned. The editors emphasize, however, that the ruling classes of the past "distorted" history and considered "righteous revolts" to be brigandage and ruffianism; that it is the reader who must "remain cool" and analyze from different angles the historical incidents and recog- nize clearly to what class viewpoint these historical records belong.92 While the Communists have attempted to adjust the urban people's concept of "bandit," there remained for them still the problem of how to smooth over the "ill-guided" idea of "bandit" on the part of the peasantry. The styles of the official records followed certain patterns specially designed for documentary communications between mandarins and higher court officials. The peasant folk, scarcely educated, cannot be "benefited" from these published documents. To deal properly with this problem the Communists favored a bandit-lore collecting campaign among the peasantry. The motivation can be easily understood: the rural areas are the places where bandits had been active; hence, the popularity of tales, songs, and legends about bandits among the rural folk. Therefore, beginning in April 1958, Folk- Literature (Min-chien wen-hsiieh RrMJzZT-) began to publish 91. Cf.

These stories, in general, emphasized how the peasant folk were oppressed by yang-mao-tzu ~=T ("the foreign hairy ones"), erh-mao-tzu z=i ("the running dogs of the yang-mao- tzu"), and the Manchu officials. Referring to Chang's tales, the editor's note (April, 1958) says: "We know that many places circulate revolutionary folksongs and stories which are concerned with anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, such as stories about the Opium War (Sino British War), the T'ai-p'ing t'ien-kuo ;kZ XSt [1850-1864, The T'ai-p'ing Rebellion], the Nien chiin f, [in the 1860's, The Nien Rebellion], and Hui-min ch'i-i jf [c. 1825, 1845, 1866, 1873, and 1878, The Revolts of the Hui People].... 'We hope that folk-literature workers from all places will, with a highly political enthusiasm, concern them- selves with the collecting of this kind of materials."93 After the publication of Chang's Boxer stories there seemed to have been no hesitation as to why bandit tales and songs should remain neglected. In the following year, folksongs about the I-ho-t'uan and legends and songs about T'ai-p'ing t'ien-kuo appeared in Folk-Literature alongside with tales about the I-ho-t'uan. Legends and songs about the Nien rebellion were published in Folk- Literature beginning in January, 1960.94 Collections of bandit tales and songs in book form also circulated. In 1960, the branch Research Institute of Literature of the Academy of Sciences in Kiangsu Province published Collection of Folksongs and Legends of T'ai-p'ing-t'ien-kuo (T'ai-p'ing-t'ien-kuo ko-yao ch'uan-shuo chi gTiS-fi~{~;-K).

Even Ku Chieh-kang, one of the organizers of the Folksong Research Society in Peking University (1922), who became director of the Institute of Philology and History in the Sun Yat-sen University (1928-29) and whom Lu Hsiin criticized as a "modernistic opportunist" (1927), encourages the collecting of Boxers' stories. It is Ku Chieh-kang who proof-read the stories of the I-ho-t'uan collected by Chang Shih-chieh. In his letter to the editor of Folk-Litera- ture (March 14, 1958) he says: "These stories are really touch- ing. From these stories we can tell how dissatisfied were the masses of the people towards the ruling class under the emperor, the officials; how the imperialists oppressed China and stirred up the righteousness of the people, insomuch that the people had to rely on huge swords to resist arms and artillery; how the reactionary ruling clique, taking no head of the people's re- sistance, toadied to the imperialists and begged peace negotiations in order to ensure their survival. This is the real history of the people."97 Again Ku in his article "After Reading the I-ho-t'uan stories" ("Tu-le I-ho-t'uan ku-shih chih-hou ~-YT:F;Lty j ") writes: "The areas that the I-ho-t'uan occupied were vast.

Folklore theory and techniques in pre-Communist and Communist China 1. Terminology For the purpose of understanding the study of the develop- ment of the science of folklore in China, a closer examination of Chinese folklore terminology would seem to be necessary. A. Pre-Communist China A modern term for the science of folklore in the Chinese, language is min-su-hsiieh If!?, which has been widely used since the founding of the Folk-song Research Society. Min means "people, folk"; su as a noun means "customs" and, as an adjec- tive, "popular." Hsiieh means "study, science." Hence, min-su- hsiieh altogether means "the study (or the science) of the cus- toms of the people." There seems to have been a tendency among the members of the Society to use min-su-hsiieh as an equivalent of "the science of folklore" in English. But it appears that even some of them seemed to have trouble in defining properly the true meaning of the science of folklore. For the Chinese folklore scholars who were still haunted by the ethics of the old tradition, to engage in folklore studies meant a sacrifice of their reputation. Min-su-hsiieh was encouraged by means of excuses such as "for the benefit of social reform," "for bringing new ideas to modern Chinese literature." This confusion was best exemplified by Ch'ang Hui g;t, formerly a member of the Folk-Song Research Society of Peking and now 98. Ku Chieh-kang, "Tu-le I-ho-t'uan ku-shih chih-hou kST [^f1' i~J;S ," Min-chien wen-hsiieh (February, 1959), p. 53. 38</page><page sequence="39">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA a member of the Society of Chinese Folk-Literature and Arts in Communist China. He said (1922): "So, in order to study folk- songs, not only is [an appreciation of] literature important, but also important is the understanding of the people's psychology. In order to investigate the people's psychology it is extremely necessary to pay attention to books concerning folk customs (min-su)... We should from now on study min-su-hsiieh {ti - (Fockeore) [sic] enthusiastically !"" The pioneer Chinese folklore scholars, headed by Chou Tso-jen, Shen Chien-shih ft?, Ch'ien Hsiian-t'ung A1M3, Liu Fu V!JM, Hu Shih -M Ku Chieh-kang, Ch'ang Hui, Lo Ch'ang-p'ei ,St, and many others, may be called the literary school of folklore of Peking University. They showed some interest in, and encouraged the study of, min-su-hsiieh, but none of them was of a mind to raise min-su-hsiieh as a science among other disciplines; nor did they develop any folklore theories. Aside from that, min-su-hsiieh, because of the word su, was easily misunderstood as a study about "popular stories and customs and beliefs." Ts'ai Yiian-p'ei made an attempt in 1926 to clarify the point that "'folklore' was created by W. J. Thomas [sic] to replace 'popular antiquities' which means min-su-hsiieh... Here in this article I use min- tsu-hsiieh as an all-embracing term...to follow that in the Ger- man language..."100 But the term min-su-hsiieh, or the English equivalent "popular antiquities," had become so predominant that it was widely used in North and South China folklore socie- ties from 1920 on until the founding of the People's Republic. Nevertheless, Ts'ai's effort was a good start toward a scientific approach to folklore, and the study of folklore as an independent discipline gradually made headway in China. Beginning in 1928, the second stage of folklore studies in China can be said to have emerged, in the folklore department of Sun Yat-sen University. In general, the folklore scholars, chiefly Ku Chieh-kang, Jun Chao- tsu ,Vg1 Yang Ch'eng-chih ;~ , Ch'ien Nan-yang ig, Chung Ching-wen, and Pai Shoui-i ?B succeeded in collecting folk- tales and legends and gradually made their way as folklorists. The folklore activity in this stage was characterized by an effort to combine fieldwork materials and experiences with speculative 99. Cf. Ch'ang Hui tg, 'T'an Pei-ching ti ko-yao jt,ftle - ," Hu-shih wen-ts'un Mtjt], Vol. IV, Series ii, Shanghai: Ya-tung t'u-shu kuan =i # , 1925, pp. 350-351. 100.

The public then saw the publication of works such as The Talks on Folk-tales by Chao Ching-shen jE?g, Supersti- tions and Legends (Mi-hsin yii ch'uan-shuo sf-=3) by Jung Chao-tsu, and many other works on different folklore genres. Unfortunately, for lack of available references, they cannot be discussed here. The folklore activities of this stage were heightened by the advent of Wolfram Eberhard, who collected fairy tales and legends in Chekiang and South China. Fortunate- ly, some of the collections of this period became a reality to Western folklorists, owing to Eberhard's effort in having prepared a handy bibliography in his Typen Chinesischer Volksmirchen.l10 These are the two stages of folklore activities in pre-Com- munist China. B. Communist China The Chinese Communist folklore workers have used the term min-chien wen-hsiieh lJN,lf~, since the founding of the People's Republic. Min-chien means "amid the people"; wen-hsiieh means "literature"; hence, min-chien wen-hsiieh means "literature of the people," or simply "folk-literature." The folklore workers in the field are called "min-chien wen-hsiieh kung-tso-che SRXl -:Tfiff ," that is, the "folk-literature workers." Realizing that min-chien wen-hsiieh applies to oral tradition only, the "workers" also use another term, min-chien wen-i ~rs$4: wen by itself means "literature"; i means "arts"; hence, min-chien wen-i means "literature and arts of the people" or "folk arts and literature." These two terms are often interchangeable. The Communist "workers" use these terms to distinguish min-chien wen-hsiieh 101. The works by Chao Ching-shen and Jung Chao-tsu referred here are based on Chao Wei-pang, "Modern Chinese Folklore Investiga- tion (Part II)," Folklore Studies, Vol. II, Peking, 1943, pp. 84-85; 85, note 18. Cf. also Wolfram Eberhard, "Benutzte Literatur," Typen Chinesischer Volksniirchen (Folklore Fellows Communication No. 120), pp. 390-408; pp. 409-410, Helsinki, 1937; cf. also, "Bibliographischer In- dex," in Volksmdrchen aus Siidost-China (Folklore Fellows Communi- cation No. 128), pp. 300-308, Helsinki, 1941. According to Prof. Eber- hard, the books (published prior to 1935) mentioned in the bibliography are almost all in the Library of the University of California at Berkeley. 40</page><page sequence="41">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA from the "short-lived, capitalistic min-su-hsiieh."'02 However, it must be borne in mind that min-chien wen-hsiieh is not a term invented by the Communist "workers". Min-chien wen-hsiieh first appeared in the folklore department of Sun Yat-sen Univer- sity as a section of academic work of that university.103 It also appeared in a 1933 edition of the Tz'u-yiian n'gJ: Min-chien wen-hsiieh, Folklore, refers to that kind of literature which circulates among the folk in oral tradition, such as mythology, tales, legends, folksongs, etc. Folk-literature has two characteristics: (1) the inventors were not individuals but a collective body of the whole people... (2) folk-literature exists in oral tradition, not in written texts. It differs from written literature in that the inven- tion and circulation of folk-literature, for instance, a tale or a song, depend solely on oral tradition whereas ordinary literary work circulates after the work is written down on the paper.104 Perhaps, it was because the term min-chien had a more political appeal, meaning "coming from the people" that the Communist "workers" decided to use it.105 In Communist China, folklore research was at first conducted by the Research Institute of Literature in the Chinese Academy of Science. Later, the Research Society of the Chinese Folk- Literature and Arts (Chung-kuo min-chien wen-i yen-chiu-hui '1X1Hr2almS ^ ~ ) was organized in February 1950 in Peking. With the establishment of this Society, the collecting and publish- ing of folklore materials were handled by the Society itself while the Research Institute took care of folklore research of a literary or linguistic nature such as the compiling of the long folk- narratives of the minority peoples. The Society consists of both pre-Communist and Communist folklore workers, men such as 102.

Scope of folklore studies A. Pre-Communist China A review of the folklore activities in North and South China shows that folklore research in pre-Communist China intended to cover the following topics: folksongs (of the city, of the rural folk, of the far-off soldiers), children's rhymes, riddles, proverbs, fairy tales, legends about emperors and literati, legends of gods and immortals, festivals, customs, animals and plants, places and old buildings; folk-belief and superstitions, folk- religion, mythology, folklore of the Miao and Yao tribes, folk arts (mainly museum articles such as costume and festival articles, New Year's pictures, musical instruments, images of gods and sacred objects), and folk medicine.106 Of these folklore genres, mythology and folk medicine were still not fully ex- plored, while folk-drama went unnoticed. B. Communist China Although all the folklore genres of the pre-Communist period are retained and, in addition, some other fields are included such as folk-drama, oral narrative poems, and folk-literatures of the minority peoples, and bandit-lore, there is a certain Communist tabu to be observed: beliefs in ghosts and superstitions should not be tolerated. The people are indoctrinated to "despise ghosts" and "thoroughly do away with superstitions".107 Folktales and legends that have superstitious elements are retained to the 106. Cf. Chao Wei-pang, op. cit. (Part I), pp. 59-60; 63; 68; 70-71; 75; (Part II) pp. 80-84. 107.

Folk-medicine that appeals to magic arts are virtually non-existent. It is no wonder why there is no publica- tion in the field of folk-beliefs and superstitions. 3. Folklore theory and techniques A. Pre-Communist China If there is any folklore contribution bearing on folklore theory, belonging to the pre-Communist era, it would be the inspirational essay by Ts'ai Yiian-p'ei, entitled "Shuo min- tsu-hsiieh" |%Si , in which he demonstrates that min-tsu-hsiieh (Volkerkunde) is a science which examines the cultures of different peoples and furthers the descriptive or the comparative studies of the cultures of these different peoples. Ts'ai's term min-tsu-hsiieh seems to be most applicable, then as now, to the situation in China: an area of multi-linguistic characteristics, an area populated by peoples of different religious faiths. In a narrow sense, min-tsu-hsiieh implies the studies of the cultures of the peoples in China; and, in a broad sense, the cultures of the peoples in Asia and other continents. However, Ts'ai. like many of his contemporaries, was not a folklorist. His theory on min-tsu-hsiieh was merely an interpretation (a translation) of European folklore ideas. But Ts'ai's ideas brought light to the folklore studies in both North and South China, especially the folklore center at Sun Yat-sen University. Ts'ai also in- dicated that min-tsu-hsiieh is affiliated with culture history, sociology, psychology, linguistics, geography, fine arts, literature, anthropology, archeology, and ethnology (see the first section of this paper). Generally speaking, folklore theory of the pre-Communist period followed that of the Finnish school. This was true in both North and South China. Chu Tzu-ch'ing in his Chinese Folksongs (Chung-kuo ko-yao), which had been Chu's lecture series since 1929, illustrated conspicuously the Finnish school of the historic-geographic method as introduced by R. D. Jameson.l08 In South China, Chung Ching-wen in his essay "A Glimpse at Persian Tales" ("Po-ssu ku-shih k'ui-liieh" h i:r P. ) wrote: "Candidly speaking, my work mainly is to supply 108. See note 54 above. 43</page><page sequence="44">CHUN-CHIANG YEN similar types of Chinese variants which they [the folklorists of the Finnish school-trans.] have not yet discovered, and, based on these materials, reach a comparatively exact conclusion-to determine the geographical areas where these similar variants occurred.109 Technically, the pre-Communist folklore workers preferred recording with strict fidelity, making detailed transcriptions, faithful translations, proper motif-indexing, and classifying of types of tales. Folklore research should be a "purely scholastic work"; folklore research and propaganda should be separated.110 B. Communist China In an all-powerful, Party-controlled land, independent folk- lore theory is a forbidden paradise. In Communist China, it was Chung Ching-wen who tried to lead a rebellious younger generation to challenge the Red supremacy, in an attempt to foster freedom of folklore speculation, following the pattern of the European school. The result was that Chung, together with European theory, was condemned. In Communist China, folklore theory must follow the Party 109. Chung Ching-wen ;tfC, "Po-ssu ku-shih k'ui-liieh VAfi5j r M," Min-su yiieh-k'an TSI1, Nos. 21-22, quoted in "Chung Ching- wen shih ko shen-me yang ti chuan-chia S C-f l ," by Chiang Lu f, Min-chien wen-hsiieh (February, 1958), p. 11, and n. 20 on p. 13. 110. A few pre-Communist folklore techniques are traceable in the "regulations concerning the collection of modern Chinese folksongs" (cf. Chao Wei-pang, op. cit., Part I, p. 60): 7. The contributors are expected: a. to annotate the dialect and idiomatic expressions. b. to copy the songs as they are, no matter whether they are elegant or vulgar; not to polish the language and not to change the vulgar-written characters or colloquial expres- sions. c. to note the sound of the local characters that cannot be found in dictionaries. Transcription in Roman or phonetic alpha- bet is preferable.... e. to note the society and time in which the songs were or are circulating. Most of the points in this passage were proposed by Chung Ching- wen in his pre-Communist writings which are now being attacked by Communist folklore workers; cf. Chia Chih (1), op. cit., pp. 9-14. 44</page><page sequence="45">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA ideology. Yet it is interesting to note how the study of folklore theory is treated in the work of Chung Ching-wen. In his essay "Some Basic Understandings About Folk Literature and Arts" ("Tui-yu min-chien wen-i ti i-hsieh chi-pen jen-shih StSlF ~-&gt;; S^g* "), Chung observed that ...folk literature and arts originated and developed from the masses of the people in their long process of social life and social struggles... The masses by means of their artistic creation have genuinely and fruitfully preserved their own life history as well as the history of the spiritual world. Gorki once affirmed that, 'if we have no knowledge of the oral tradition of the people, it would not be possible to understand the real history of the laboring people...' The composition of folk literature and arts is a com- plicated one. Some elements are the infusion of the literature of the ruling class; some are the work of urban petty bourgeoisie who imitate the literary works of the upper strata; some are the absurd inventions of the Buddhist monks and Taoist practitioners... All these, speaking strictly from the angle of the masses, are a sort of 'additional' contents. Indeed they are really poisonous and corrupt the air.111 This article heralded Chung's career as a Communist folklore worker and the continuation of folklore in Communist China. However, Communist literature shows that Chung is a "pseudo- Communist folklore worker," and that the study of folklore in Chung's hand plays a role of intriguing complexity. It is a story of conflict between the Party and Chung and his followers over the rightful application of folklore. The Party views folklore as a device for propagandizing "socialism"; folklore is intended for "rendering services to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers."112 Chung, on the other hand, argues that propaganda and the study of folklore should be distinguished as black is from the white; that the study of folklore should be purely scientific. He reiterates: "the comparative study of analogous and similar folktales is quite significant."113 Regarding folklore techniques, Chutg, as a professor in folk-literature and arts in Fu jen ta-hsiieh f -fi A (The Catholic University of Peking) 111.

He suggests that a folk-literature and folk-art worker should be aided by other disciplines, such as folklore, ethnology, and anthropology.114 In the matter of recording, transcribing, and translating, he favors completely truthful and accurate work. He intends to initiate a folklore journal on the international level, and refers to the low qualities of some of the articles in Folk-Literature.l5 More- over, he believes that folklore research should not be allowed to play into the hands of those who know nothing about folklore, such as Chou Yang and Chia Chih.116 In Chung's mind, the study of folklore can be maintained by playing with words such as "the masses of the people," "the laboring folk," "Gorki said...," and so on. But, unlike his contemporaries, such as Ku Chieh- kang and Ch'ang Hui, Chung fails to realize that folklore exists only for the use of the Party. It is the Party that authorizes his "duty to serve the Party." Folklore is designed for what the Party expects it to be, not for what an individual likes it to be. However, Chung's challenge to the Party is evidence to show to the free world how much free will or so-called "new demo- cracy" is being exercised in Communist China. It is apparent that Chung's claim for a rightful application of folklore aroused wide interest among his colleagues and students, for in 1957 there was a motion to abolish the Research Society of Folk-literature and Arts.117 The reason given to sup- port this motion was that folklore should be conducted as "scientific research," not "for the service of socialist politics."ll8 Now the Party being critically exposed, the Communists threw 114.

Because "folklore of the capitalistic strata originates in countries of capitalism to meet the demands for consolidating the reactionary sovereignty over the subject people and for expand- ing colonialism."l12 Further, to give evidence, a Communist quotes in parte a passage from the "Introduction" of Charlotte S. Burne's The Handbook of Folklore (pp. 3-4) of which the text in toto'22 reads as follows: [The conception of man's past history which has resulted from, and now directs, the study of folklore, has already made its impress on modern philosophical thought, and] it would be difficult to over- estimate the additions to the sum of human knowledge which may be made in course of years by a continuance of the study on these lines. Meanwhile one very practical result should follow from it, namely, the improved treatment by governing nations of the subject- races under their sway. "This is a naked description," says the Communist Chiang Lu afI. "It has exposed the reality of the matter of fact. Yet, is this not what Chung Ching-wen has lauded as 'the glorious anthropologists' or 'the pure scholastic movement [of folklore-- trans.]' ?"123 Despite the fact that the Communist folklore workers have no theory of their own, they agree that Chung has none of his; "'Chung is only plagiarizing the old stuff of the capitalist strata folklore."'24 Criticizing the Finnish school of the historic- geographic method, Chia Chih says: ...the so-called scholastic research is merely to examine from what country a tale comes and to formulate a type-index of tales, thus, to strip the skins and sinews from many touching stories and pull out a few pieces of bones-the types of motifs, to fix them into the 119.

As for the tales, their social significance, their concrete, artistic outlook and the ethnological characteristics, all are excluded.l25 The comparative method of studying folktales is also attacked for a similar reason: By means of the comparative method and the type-index Chung Ching-wen says that the motifs of tales of different countries and peoples are "similar" or "analogous" and draws some unreliable "conclusions" that such motifs occurred in such and such places. Beyond this, very often Chung neglects the differences of tale variants (even though sometimes he superficially touches a tiny bit, he tries to explain through arguments such as "transmission" or "psychologically similar occurrence"). Yet, he never searches into the fundamental reasons that there are differences and analogies between tales.126 Favoring a "faithful recording" but against a "word by word transcription" technique, the Communist folklore workers pro- pose a "proper modification" policy.127 As the Communist folk- lore workers admit, faithful recording is the basis of all scientific research. But what is the so-called "properly manufactured" technique? Here is an instance, the story of "The Fisher Boy" ("Yii t'ung" j) ). It narrates the adventures of an old fisherman who earns his living by fishing on the Dragon River, a down-at-the-heels life. In the rolling waves, at the risk of his own life he procures a white jade fish-jar. On the fish-jar is engraved a tiny fisher boy. The fisher boy can become alive and grow and, with his fishing- rod, can hook the fish which are engraved on the bottom part of the fish-globe and which also can become alive and grow. The fisher boy lifts up his fishing-rod and splashes the fish on the water. The splash of water scatters in all directions and falls in golden drops. When the fisher boy stops angling and returns, a spread of gold beans is scattered around the fish-jar. The old fisherman picks up a handful of the gold beans and heads for the market. Just as he takes out the gold beans to buy something, a foreign missionary swaggers by and questions him. The old fisherman, being too honest, tells the pastor every- 125.

Chia Chih (1), op. cit., p. 13; also Chia Chih (2), pp. 28-29. 48</page><page sequence="49">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA thing. Next day the old fisherman is brought to the yamen ("court house"). He is accused of having stolen a fish-jar which belonged to the pastor. After questioning the fisherman, the mandarin decides that the pastor should have the fish-jar. The old man is so incensed that he falls into a faint and breaks the fish-jar. The fisher boy comes back to life and hooks the pastor's upper jaw, and throws him up in the air. The mandarin is frightened to death.128 In order to see how this tale was processed it is necessary to quote in full detail the technique involved. According to Chang Shih-chieh, the collector of the story of "Yii-t'ung," his view of processing the story is as follows: In processing this story, several junctures were handled in this way: in the beginning paragraph which describes how the old man procured the precious thing, the informant gave a comparatively simple narration. I made this paragraph a detailed description. This will present a striking picture of the old man's courage and wisdom and reveal the fact that procuring a precious thing is not an easy matter (the narrator tried to explain this point but did not make it clear). In the section in which the fisher boy was fishing and the splash of water scattered and fell into gold beans, the narrator only mentioned that the fisher boy was singing while fish- ing. Based on this subsidiary event, I let the fisher boy sing an eight-line song. In my opinion, the story itself is beautiful, especial- ly in this particular section. If I allow the fisher boy to sing, will this story not bring a more successful result? So I added eight lines of song. In the section in which the old man was brought to the court to hear the judge, the informant only told that the district magistrate wanted to give the fish-jar to the pastor; that as soon as the old man testified how he had procured the precious jar, he fell in a dead faint. Immediately after that, the fisher boy be- came alive. I made some arrangement of the talks between the district magistrate and the old fisherman. In telling how the old man had obtained his precious thing, the informant mentioned that the fisher boy was dressed in Chinese costume, but the informant did not mention this point [in the section in which the fisherman was brought to hear the judge-trans.] in the "court house." I added this point in their talks so that the old man's defense silenced 128. This summary is based on an article by Chang Shih-chieh (1), "Wo-tuei sou-chi cheng-li ti k'an-fa it~b ~;," Min-chien wen-hsiieh (December, 1959), pp. 92-93. Part of this summary is taken from Chang Shih-chieh, "Yii-t'ung j^,,," Min-chien wen-hsiien (April, 1958), pp. 81-86; for an English version cf. "The Fisherboy," (tr. Gladys Yang) Chinese Literature, Peking (January, 1960). pp. 108-115. 49</page><page sequence="50">CHUN-CHIANG YEN the magistrate and the pastor. It was not until the magistrate and the pastor had completely exposed their "real intention" ["simply want your fish-jar," said the pastor-trans.] that the old man fainted. I think this point not only gives a contrast between the characters but also makes the central thought striking. I think this kind of processing does not change the theme and the main details of the story; nor does it lose the atmosphere and the color of the original. I think this may be considered to be faithful.129 That "proper reworking" is allowed is further justified by the argument that, "since folk literature has two face values-it is an artistic work and, again, it is valuable material in respect to culture and science-therefore, there should be different methods of processing them. As scientific research materials, there must be emphasis on the faithfulness of recording;...the collectors should..., according to the requirements of scientific research, record and transcribe the articles and selected materials and provide the original records for scientific workers. As literary work, although a similarly faithful recording is also emphasized, but for the purpose of providing the people with a comparatively refined work, it is our opinion that a proper arrangement and reworking should be effected."130 One may ask: when will scientific folklore research make a start? The answer is in readi- ness: "We must under available conditions gradually develop our scientific research. Folk-literature, like any other science, will in the course of time achieve its mission of aiming at inter- national standards. But elevation must be fulfilled on the basis of popularization. At present we should first give heed to the %Nork of popularization."'3' 129. Chang Shih-chieh (1), op. cit., p. 93. Prof. Eberhard points out that it is doubtable whether the narrator did say "pastor" or "foreign missionary." As a type, this kind of story belongs to the "The Moham- medan finds treasures." The evil man is a non-Chinese. Prof. Eberhard is of the opinion that it is along the lines of party policy to replace the non-Chinese with an European and not to mention the Muslim as an evil character. I wish here to express my thanks to Prof. Eberhard for his patience in reading part of this paper in 1964 and for his valuable comments. 130. Chia Chih (1), op. cit., pp. 12-13. 131.

Changes of social background The economic life of the people in pre-Communist China was mainly based on agriculture. There were no "people's com- munes." The people as individuals had leisurely moments. This could be well illustrated by the folksong quoted below. This song, like many of its contemporaries, suggests a slow tempo best suited for leisurely singing. The atmosphere is romantic; it is a picture full of folk imagination: The Flute Is Sounding The moon shimmers in its brightness, The sea is wide and deep. Maiden Ch'iung Lien hearkens to the sounding flute; She secretly leaves the dragon palace for Chang Lang's tryst.132 The moon shimmers in its brightness; The sea is wide and deep. The sweetie across the river hearkens to my sounding flute; She looks around behind the door for the oars.133 The moon shimmers in its brightness; The sea is wide and deep. The nocturnal sand-grouse listens to the sounding flute; My sweetie and I meet in the sea surrounding us.134 This folksong was from the Chekiang province. Now, in a song of the same province in Communist China, we detect a change in the economic life of the people. People live and work for the "people's communes." The people are deprived of their leisure moments. The people sing for "more production." The singer in the song is part of a collective body of the laboring folk. The scene, though somewhat romantic, is more realistic; it is a picture of commune life: 132. Ch'iung Lien and Chang Lang are the hero and heroine in Chekiang legends. 133. The people in Chekiang used to put their oars behind the door when they returned from fishing. 134.

The "old scraps of Chinese folklore" they picked up are abundant in Peking, where the folk are well-known for their nrocking humor. These songs and little tales depict the daily life of the town folk and occasionally in- dulge in moral satires on the emerging "modern" generation. For instance, failure to observe filial piety may be censured in a song: Jr-IIl.E~~ A The magpie has a long tail - after he -T~78 ;~IT has taken a wife he no more wants his AfljRt,W11jtw- ~ mother - when his mother wants to eat some lalti Allf A&lt; VXcheap cake then (he says) "there is no Ml~J^{AVLI iidle money to mend willow spoons" _ when (H,_h_,g his wife wants to eat pears - then he gets ready his ass - and goes to the market _ JTi7 - zwhen he has bought the pears he peels 7T-fT i them - and asks, wife, wife, will you eat A[trMA[UPL] pears?136 This story is about a woman who lies about her age: His Wife's True Age137 A man took an old woman as wife.

So he asked her, "How old are you?" The woman said, "My age is still wee; only forty-five." Her husband said, "Why, then, in that horoscopic slip of yours it was written you're thirty-eight! Insofar as I can judge, your age could hardly be less than forty-five. You must tell me the truth." The woman said, "Actually I am aged fifty-four." Still her husband couldn't believe it and kept asking her, but she wouldn't yield any further. When night came, her husband had a funny idea and told the woman, "You go to bed first. I want to have a look at my salt jar. Yesterday the mice filched it and ate a good bit." As soon as the woman heard this, she couldn't but give a hearty laugh, saying, "Old dame that I am, throughout sixty-eight years of my life I haven't ever heard people say that mice filch salt to eat !" Now these humorous-natured Pekingese folk seem occupied in the Party's campaign for national industrialization. "Idle" stories could only hinder the productivity of the working people. Collections of merry tales are few. A few songs from Peking are collected in Songs of the Red Flag. In these songs, the people's voice is "for work"; their humor turns on mechanization: Change Your Abacus For A Computer138 What was right for yesterday is no good for today; by evening the quotas fixed in the morning are overfulfilled several hundred per cent. Hey, you there, Mr. Statistician! You'll be needing air transport to draw that graph. It's time you got rid of that abacus and got an electronic computer instead. After reading in Songs of the Red Flag, such songs as this: Every Hand's As Busy As Can Be139 Every lathe is turning with a roar, everyone is on the battle-field, every hand's as busy as can be, every crate of products flashes gold, every drop of sweat is trickling down, every face is alight with a ruddy glow, every wall is covered with red flags, every red graph shoots towards the sky, 138.

B. Changes of themes and ideas Throughout this study an attempt has been made to describe the folklore research achieved in Communist China. A useful approach to the study of Chinese folklore is to note the funda- mental differences of folk expression between the people in the Communist world and the people in the free world. In China, the folk idea of the pre-Communist period centers around gods, immortals, emperors. It describes man as a hybrid, possessing human and divine nature. (In Communist terms, the belief in a divine nature is a "superstitious tradition.") The Communists believe that the human component is a reflection of the folk peasant himself; the divine is an imaginative construe beyond reality. For instance, in a legend of the pre-Communist period, "Chao K'uang-yin," the central figure is an emperor. The legend is told as follows: Chao K'uang-yin (No. 1)140 In his youth Chao K'uang-yin (who later became the first Em- peror of the Sung Dynasty) was good for nothing and the terror of his village. One year there was a terrible drought and all the crops were burnt up. The people beseeched the gods to send them rain, but not even a drop of dew appeared. Chao was a passionate gambler. If he won, he went off with the money; if he lost, he never paid a cent. In this way he gained his living, but naturally during the drought no one wanted to gamble, and he was in a bad way. He became more and more quick-temper- ed and depressed, but one evening a new plan occurred to him, which, if successful, would enable him to live a little longer. He went to the headman of the village and said: 'If you give me one hundred strings of cash, I will beg the gods to send rain.' The headman was a little sceptical of his being able to do this, but he called together the inhabitants and consulted them as to whether he should pay the money or not. 'What do you need for the sacri- fice?' he asked Chao K'uang-yin. 'Nothing really,' he replied, 'just 140. Wolfram Eberhard, Chinese Fairy Tales and Folk Tales, Lon- don, 1937, pp. 288-289. 54</page><page sequence="55">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA make a circle of fire, and put a table in the middle for me to stand on.' The village elders and the peasants were surprised at this request, but in view of the desperate plight that the village would be in if no rain fell, they agreed to provide the things. When the fire was burning, Chao got on to the table and called out: 'When is rain coming?' He himself never expected anything to happen, but, having a golden tongue and jade words, the Wind Count and the Rain Master, without hesitating, sent a storm of rain at once. In a recently published legend of Communist China, the folk idea is unmistakably different: Prince Lu141 Defeated Li Hung-chang142 Prince Lu led his warriors and horsemen, five hundred thou- sand, strong, great and magnificent, conquering and fighting south and north from Anhui to Shantung, from Shantung turning to Honan, from Honan to Hupei. In less than half a month they ravaged several provinces. As they marched, it was splendid! The banners and flags, waving and unrolling, covered up the skies and the moon. Man elbowed man; horse side-stepped horse, crowding and milling around. The streets were swarmed with soldiers who set themselves in a pat- tern five leagues broad and ten leagues long. Little hills where men and horses marched were trodden flat. The droppings of the horses filled up the rivers and creaks. When the spiral horns from each camp were blown, the heavens and earth turned dull. The beating of the battle drums could shake the mountains and the earth. The Ch'ing ogres [the Ch'ing Government, soldiers, etc.- trans.], no sooner had they heard of the coming of Prince Lu's soldiers and horsemen, were terrified even more than did the mouse when it was met by a cat. The Ch'ing ogres used to sing: Grand Papa of Heaven, Grand Mama of Earth We promise to offer swine and sheep. Grant that they be the banners red and white, May we see not the Blue Banner's face. Prince Lu was the banner lord of the blue banners. He slew the number one old ogre of the Ch'ing Government, Seng-ko-lin- ch'ing143 at Ts'ao Prefecture; he also defeated Tseng Kuo-fan, the 141. Prince Lu, or Lu Wang tE, was surnamed Jen {, with given name Chu i (Jen Chu), or Hua-pang f{L (Jen Hua-pang). He was one of the Nien Rebellion leaders. 142.

When the news of Prince Lu's coming reached the Purple Forbidden Palace of Peking, the civil courtiers were afraid and were not able to rise from their beds; the military officials, putting on wind-protecting hats, pretended they had a cold. The Empress Dowager was struck with fear, and for seven days tasted no food nor beverage. Her white face turned a yellowish waxen color. Daily she stood at the pavilion in the palace yard. Clutching a thousand-league-eye [a telescope-trans.], a gift from the foreign- ers, she peeped through it, looking southward and looking south- ward; even the shadows of the clouds she took to be Prince Lu's fighting men and horses. Grasping a rosary in her hand, all she did was, not praying Amida Buddha, mutter and grumble, 'If Prince Lu comes, what shall I do? If Prince Lu comes, what shall I do?...' The eunuch Li Lien-ying noticed the thousand-league-eye in the Empress Dowager's hand. An idea suddenly occurred to him. Immediately he bent on one knee in salute and said, 'Your Venerable Majesty, your humble slave that I am has a plan which might be a solution to the trouble of the nation.' Empress Dowager, who was at her wits' end, gave an answer of her own accord, 'Mind you state it clearly without delay !' 'Your slave that I am thinks that the people across yonder sea are able men. They make striking-clocks; they make thousand- league-eyes; besides, they make foreign guns, foreign cannons, foreign ships. It may be well to invite these foreigners to smite the Nien rebels. And to buy their foreign guns, foreign cannons. Will this do or not?' On the Empress Dowager's face blood suddenly flowed, 'I enter- tained this idea long ago ! . But where could we hunt a keen-minded, able, and most faithful and loyal statesman to deal with the for- eigners?' Li Lien-ying winked with that wink of a slave and said, 'Your slave that I am has heard that Li Hung-chang, Governor of Kiangsu, is skilful in foreign affairs. It is best to summon him to the court.' The Empress Dowager thought and thought. As she could think of no other person more adequate than Li, she summoned Li to the court. From that time on Li Hung-chang became[, as the saying goes, -trans.] 'the wife who, being a daughter-in-law, suffers hardship and watches for the death of her mother-in-law; now she queens it.' Throughout the whole day he was occupied in buying foreign guns, fixing foreign cannons, enlisting irregular troops, enlarging militia. Burning with arrogance, could he behave like a mere man any longer? he even forgot who his ancestors were! The Empress Dowager observed that he was, indeed, loyal and faithful and handed over to him more troops. But because of this he became more arrogant than ever, as though oil were poured 56</page><page sequence="57">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA upon flames. When Prince Lu heard of this he became fiercely angry. He brandished a brush and wrote on the field gun several big charac- ters: 'Pu sha chien-tse Li Hung-chang, pu suan Chung-kuo hao erh-lang.' ('If traitor Li Hung-chang cannot be put to death, none can be called good Chinese fellows.') He divided the soldiers and horsemen into several units along different routes and adopted 'winding up tactics' [guerrilla warfare-trans.] to counterattack the Ch'ing ogres. When the troops of Li Hung-chang hastened to Ts'ao- chou Prefecture, Prince Lu's men turned their course to the Kuei-te Prefecture of Honan; when Li hastened to Hupei, Prince Lu had already wound through Anhui to Shantung, stealthily reaching after the hind quarters of Li Hung-chang ! Without a great effort than 'blowing-dust-away,' he seized thirteen hsien in the Ts"ao-chou Pre- fecture of Shantung. In this manner Prince Lu led Hi Hung-chang by the nose, spinning him about for one year and eight months. The ogreish Ch'ing soldiers thus dragged around were exhausted; so were the horses. So dragged out was Li Hung-chang that he couldn't get his breath. He panted, drawing one deep breath after another. Riding on his saddled horse he wailed and called upon heaven: 'I am Li that must have been in debt to a predestined retribution,. that I be confronted with Jen Hua-pang, that evil demon. O Heaven ! O Heaven! Bless me! Bless me!' Prince Lu's men and horsemen were rolling in, while the more Li Hung-chang fought, the fewer became his soldiers. At one time, Prince Lu assembled five thousand horsemen and five thousand foot soldiers at the bank of the Yellow River. They were all set for the coming of Li Hung-chang. One day, Prince Lu with his Nien brothers was twisting the grass into straw ropes and weaving straw sandals when all of a sudden a horseman mounted spy rode up and reported, 'Ogre Li, leading fifty thousand Ch'ing ogres with some foreign-gun corps, is coming at our battle array.' Prince Lu, undisturbed, threw away the still unshaped straw sandal, bound his red turban, spat spittle, and rubbed his hands. He picked up his weapon weighing forth-eight catties and waved to the Nien brothers, 'Brothers ! Be ready! When these old sandals are worn out, we'll be wearing new ones by the time we come back...' Before his words had fallen in the air, he had already rushed to the camp gate. His yellow steed came neighing and running to Prince Lu. As soon as it saw Prince Lu, the horse capered about, shaking its head and tail. Prince Lu leapt high and jumped on the horse's back. Like a puff of smoke he dashed out. The soldiers Li Hung-chang led billowed like sea tides toward the garrison gate. 57</page><page sequence="58">CHUN-CHIANG YEN Prince Lu gave a tug at the bridle, and rode to the sloping hills on the left side of the garrison gate. He lifted up a banner pole some ten feet long which had been erected on the hill slope. He raised it thrice and swung it thrice from left to right. At once the Nien horsemen from all camp held fast to their spears and swords and lined up in a single column. The Prince lifted up the great banner and let his horse race forward for several hundred feet. Looking at the Ch'ing ogres, pushing on like ants, he struck the ban- ner pole in the ground, and his soldiers, who were spread out in single file, immediately formed a double column. The soldiers on foot were followed by the horsemen. The soldiers on foot were equipped with long spears; the horsemen were ready with their steel swords. All were in solemn silence, each one waiting in his own position. Behind the Nien army was the Yellow River with boisterous breakers and the noise of the rushing waves. Hearing the roaring waters behind and catching a glimpse of the Ch'ing ogres in front, Prince Lu waved to his army and shouted, 'Brothers, do you hear? Behind us is the rolling Yellow River. Do you see? In front are the Ch'ing ogres with daggers drawn. What must we do? Look here !' As soon as he had finished speaking, Prince Lu took his double-barreled gun, and aimed at the round guord on top of the pole of the big blue banner. P'ing ! There burst out seven fire balls from the guord. In a twinkling, the Nien army like a volcanic eruption rushed toward the enemy position, their sword clashing in every direction. The Nien foot soldiers flourished their long spears. The Ch'ing horsemen in front wielded sabres. But before they could reach the Nien army from a far distance, they were pierced by the long spears hurled by the Nien soldiers. One following another, like frogs that were pierced, they dropped from their horses. In less time than it takes to smoke a pipe, several thousands of the Ch'ing ogres were pierced and perished. Now when the foot soldiers on the Ch'ing ogres' side pushed forward for a counterattack, holding up their shields and bending their waistes like gadflies, the Ch'ing horsemen were all pierced, dead and done! At this moment, the fighting horsemen on the Nien's side manoeuvred. Kicking and whipping their horses, they made a detour and reached behind the Ch'ing foot soldiers. The Ch'ing ogres were like the ingredients for boiled dumplings on the verge of b,lng chopped. The Nien horsemen whipped their swords, and look! the cutting! Ka-tzu ! Ka-tzu! as though sharp knives were cutting the pumpkins, yet the cutting was quicker than that. In less time than one needs to finish his meal, the Ch'ing ogres were chopped dead, twenty or thirty thousand of them. When Li Hung-chang saw that he had lost to Prince Lu's battle array consisting of cavalry and foot soldiers, and that his men were almost all lost, he hurriedly urged the foreign gun corps to go into battle. 58</page><page sequence="59">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA P'ing-p'ong ! P'ing-p'ong ! the soldiers of the foreign-gun corps fired at the Nien army in battle array. At this moment, Prince Lu was chasing the fleeing Ch'ing ogres when he heard the clatter of gunfire. Reining in his horse, he stopped and knocked thrice on the forehead of his steed. Strangely, his yellow horse straightened its neck upward and whinnied endlessly 'whee whee...whee whee whee....' After the whinnying, each of the horses, as if enchanted, turned its tail southward and its head northward and kicked up its hind-hoofs. In a moment, the sky became gloomy, the earth dark. The sun and moon were obscured. The ogreish soldiers, their eyes blinded with the yellow sand dust, fired shots at random. Thus, the foreign gun corps of Li Hung-chang was neutralized by Prince Lu. Li Hung-chang was so frightened that he fled breaking wind and wetting himself and ran for his life. Prince Lu, the victor, captured quantities of horses, guns and swords, gunpowder and bullets. From that time on the Nien army grew larger than ever. Narrated by Jen Ch'uan-i. Processed by Li Tung-shan. In this legend the folk expression is different from that of the pre-Communist tradition. It celebrates the rebellion of a rural folk against the imperial ruling class. The agnostic depicted is a folk hero, an outlaw living and vivid beyond super- stitious belief. But, above all, the nucleal difference in the pat- tern of folklore themes between pre-Communist and Communist China as reflected in the texts above is that: (1) in pre-Com- munist China the theme in general is to overcome human im- possibilities by appealing to supernatural powers; (2) in Com- munist China, the theme is that all hopelessness is overcome in a seemingly sound logic of events. In the matters treated, the pre-Communists rely more upon legend as it is told by the folk than real history, while the Communists focus more on real history than mere folk invention. However, one may well raise the question whether, in the example of this tale of the Nien rebellion, we still have genuine folklore. Have the tales in Communist China been collected from the mouths of many nar- rators or are they the products of the pens of party writers? In cases such as this legend, the decision is often extremely difficult. 59</page><page sequence="60">CHUN-CHIANG YEN V. Conclusion Folklore research in Communist China viewed as a whole is still in the beginning stage. Aside from Party control in folk- lore (and other sciences), the lack of discipline among both fieldworkers and folklore research designers marks the course of folklore research in Communist China. A few works in textual research, such as those by Chu Tzu-ch'ing, Cheng Chen- to, and Wen I-to, which appear to have some good points, are survivals characteristic of Western folklore scholarship in the early twentieth century. The collecting of folklore, in the absence of proper guidance from the Party and for lack of trained folklorists in the field, results in the belittling of folklore as popular literature. After the criticism of Western folklore scholarship by the Communists in 1957-58, it is clear that Party control of folklore research will be absolute. This control would tend to reduce the scientific study of folklore to a prolonged stagnation. However, despite Party control of folklore research, the investigation of the folklore of the minority peoples cannot be overloked. The compiling of the history of folk-literatures and the collecting and publishing of the oral narrative poems and other folklore genres of the minority peoples are tangible results achieved by the Communists in this area of research. In contrast with pre-Communist China folklore research, which existed as a tail-wind of the New Culture movement, folklore in the hand of the Communists has been utilized as a tool for the propagation of a "plebeian literature." The Chinese Communists make no bones of admitting that folk art and literature should be subordinate to politics. Why should folk- lore in a Communist regime be expected to be anything but "folklorism"? But the problem is not here. That folk art and literature should be subjected to politics is evidence of an inconsistency in the economic and political setup of a Communist state national- ly and internationally. In the case of Communist China, for instance, it would seem to be economically necessary for the Communists, faced with a severe population problem, com- plicated by the limitation of arable land, to initiate a "wiping- away-superstition movement" in the rural areas, in order to restore more lands for agriculture by flattening the burial grounds. Traditionally regarding the choice of burial ground as crucial in the fates of their descendants, people of the upper 60</page><page sequence="61">FOLKLORE RESEARCH IN COMMUNIST CHINA class used to implore the help of shamans and diviners in finding lands that possessed the most propitious feng shui Rt; ("winds and waters"-the Chinese term for geomancy). They would then buy as much space as desired for the burial of numerous generations. Now, "wiping-away-superstitions" is to be under- stood in the Communists' purpose "to stick that Red Flag of atheism into the mind of the folk."144 In the "wiping-away- superstition movement," which is part of the land reform project, rallies are held in rural areas, to which the shamans and diviners are summoned to perform their witchcrafts. Failing to bring forth ghosts, the diviners testify publicly that there is "no ghost, no spirit;" that what they do is to earn their living by cheating. The optimistic conclusion from the rally is that feng-shui is no- where to be found: "not in the graves, but in the laboring hands of the folk."145 Again, in a Communist state, economic development is determined by the structure and aims of a Party-designed economic system. That is to say, the Party economists lay out the economic plans projecting the diversified lines of production in enterprises, while the fulfillment of such economic plans relies upon the labor potential of the masses. The execution of a planned economy involves the problem of effective supervision. This is true whether the enterprise is built on the basis of free competition or government monopoly. But in a Communist state the problem of superintendence is extremely serious: the workers work for the state but have no definite future of their own. Working for an indefinite future only builds up discontent re- flected in low production, whatever the designed economic plans. A recent case in Communist China was that of the "great leap forward" program of economic development early in 1958. In seeking effective measures to curb the workers' demoralization, the Party leaders claimed that folksongs had a special value. As one Communist points out, new folksongs can serve as means to "guide and promote productivity. They can stir up the work- ing energy... They are the best examples of instruments for self-amusement: no need to spend money; singing a song while working is a stimulus. Nor are they a hindrance to production. 144. Cf.

Dinko Tomasic in his chapter "The Partisan Movement" gives an excellent analysis into the political ideologies of the east European Communist states, an analysis which may bring some light to our understand- ing of the political situation in Communist China: The ruling strata, on the other hand, are already resorting to the old device of reviving and stimulating the paralyzed energies of the masses, and of redirecting dissatisfaction and feuds within their own ranks by emphasizing the possibility of the external threats. They may even indulge in external aggressive adventures for the same purpose. The emphasis on military preparedness and extreme nationalism in these countries, and the news of border tensions and guerrilla warfare in the area where the Eastern and Western spheres of interest clash, indicate such a possibility.149 This analysis helps explain why research into the folklore of the minority peoples in the border regions is most strongly emphasized, in proportion to the whole folklore research program now carried on in Communist China. Through reading many of the narrative poems, these simple-hearted border peoples are al- ready psychologically stimulated by resentments "against aggres- sive wars, against plundering, against the aggressions of the strong powers." When the time for action comes, these peoples simply rush against their "common foes," whether the battlefield be in Cambodia or Laos, in Vietnam or India, in Korea or Sinkiang. 146. Cf.
