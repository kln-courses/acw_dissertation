<plain_text><page sequence="1">January-April, 1 955 13 BOOK REVIEWS parallels the story, and they *oin in the end. It is a clever device. Science usually frowns on fiction in its field. In some cases it is justified. But here is a good exampIe of the fictitious narra- tive, carefully told, which will reach a wider audience witb a far more powerfuly told and palatable message than the scraps of fact available could ever do. Bodsworth takes facts for foundation, then builds with plaus- ible fictional materials a dramatic yarn of live versus geography and the elements. Some will brand Bodswort}1's writing as anthropomorphic. Perhaps it is, but only to the extent that the smooth flow of his tale demands. The author shows clearly in sev- eral passages that he has a scientifically ac- ceptable understanding of bird behaviour. I have but one real criticism. It is aimed not at Bodsworth but at some sources he quotes. A bird with such abundance and which laid four eggs can withstand high annual losses, indeed a theoretical maximum of 66 per cent. Was l9th century hunting really so effective that it exceeded so vast a reproductive force? Or has the full story yet to be discovered and told? The many illustrations by Terry Shortt are beautifully and accurately done. One il- lustration (p. 12) is below the high stand- ard of the rest, but this is the fault of the printers who have printed it too large. Torontonians Bodsworth and Shortt have produced a memorable little book. R. Y. EDWARDS Theo. H.

University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wis- consin. xiii - 424 pp., 22 figs., 5 tables. $7.50. Chapters deal with accounts of early set- tlerst behavioral characteristics, food, move- ments, roosts, nesting, utilization by man, methods of capture, decrease and extinction anatomical description, nomenclatureJ dis- tribution, and migration. This fascinating book appears to be the last word on the sad annals of the Passenger Pigeon. All sources from folklore and newspaper accounts to scientific reports have been gleaned to make this the most comprehensive work to date on this species. Extensive quotations from original sources give first-hand impressions of various aspects of the subject. There are impressive accounts of the great numbers of these birds that occurred during the past cen- tury, and one is amazed at the large figures given to indicate the numbers utilized for human food. Less well known is the fact that great numbers were used in trap shoot- ing. Estimates suggest that as many as 500,- 000 per year were used for such purposes during the eighteen seventies. In discussing the various factors that have been mentioned in connection with the final extinction of this bird the author comes to the conclusion that the Passenger Pigeon became extinct through constant persecution which prevented it from raising a sufficient number of young to perpetuate the race. The volume is concluded with a volumin- ous list of references and an index. This book should appeal to the amateur conservationist and professional ornithologist alike Dr. Schorger has rendered an important service in bringing this vast amount of material to- gether in one place. GEORGE E. Huosox Last of the Curtews by F:red Bodsworth. Illus by T. M. Shortt. 128 pp. Dedd, Mead. Combine a good writer and an enthusiastic naturalist, add extensive library research, have these produce a story, and a book like this must result. The tale follows one of a dying race, the Eskimo Curlew, through a year of its life. k begins on the Tundra, moves south in dramatic migration to Patagonia, and returns again to an Arctic spring. Tl2ere is a bistorical theme throughout. Apt quotations from the past both introduce each chapter of the story at hand and sketch briefly the decline of a species from abundance to vanishing point. These tell of slaughters by man, and finally link slaughters with virtual extinction. This thread of history</page></plain_text>
