(Published also by Heinemann, Lon- don.)-In his delightful foreword, Roger Tory Peterson points out that thousands of interesting facts fill this book of a distinguished scholar and ornithologist. The au- thor, Curator of the Division of Mammals and Birds at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, unpretentiously sums up his notable presentation by re- marking that our current knowledge of the phenomenon of bird migration still amounts to only a few guideposts planted in an almost virgin forest. This new edi- tion of his earlier French publication, translated by Constance D. Sherman, is revised and brought up to date. Jean Dorst knows the worldwide literature on the topic thoroughly and selects from it with the viewpoint of a true ornithologist the pertinent facts, data, interpretations, and theories. He covers the phenomena of bird migrations as they occur the world over on every continent and ocean. He writes brilliantly and with an amiable Gallic charm from which we can accept an occasional emotional anthropomorphism such as of birds fighting "jealously"; but I think one should not write that birds "migrate to avoid winter." From the factual viewpoint his writing is objective and well- weighed, and his sound definitions of migration terms should become generally ac- cepted by all ornithologists. Migration, though evolved from non-cyclical or one-way movements, he reserves for cyclic or periodic movements. Other types he defines in- clude emigration, immigration, invasion, extension, and dispersal. The author suggests the term "rest area" where it is more adequate than "winter quarters," correlating it with the period of sexual inactivity (not "inactive sexual period," p. xiv). The short introductory survey of migratory phenomena throughout the animal kingdom impresses on the reader the enormous diversity of migratory behavior in other animals as well as among birds, where it is so highly exemplified. While birds and their migrations have attracted the attention of man ever since ancient times, his understanding of the periodic appearance and disappearance of birds was long ob- scured by mystic and religious veils. Only gradually were those early advocates of the theory of migration believed, and we may assume that the observations and the writings of such a famous early "migrationist" as Pierre Belon were forgotten when in the eighteenth century the revolution of scientific thinking began. From his stimulating historical review, Dorst leads to the methods of studying bird migrations. He starts out with the all-important field observation including the mod- ern sophisticated methods of Graber's acoustic and Lowery's moon observation and the very promising radar control. He makes full use of the data from banding activi- ties all over the world. He lists the major banding efforts, headed by the U. S. A. with a total of some 11,000,000 bandings with some 600,000 new additions every year, including about 900,000 recoveries and some 50,000 yearly additions of recovered banded birds. In classifying the diverse migration phenomena, Dorst groups his examples quite significantly according to ecological or taxonomical bases. He talks about pathways and goals of coastal birds, swallows and swifts, ducks, starlings, and others. He makes the reader familiar with the principal migratory routes in the Old World and the various important analyses of European ornithologists. His statement that there are more species wintering in east than in west Africa, because of the supplementary influx of birds from eastern Europe and Siberia, makes me wonder if this is indeed so. There are enough migrants known that cross Africa from the northeast to the southwest. Thorough investigation of banded migrants remains still a challenge for ornithologists all over Africa.</page><page sequence="2">Oct. Reviews 559 1963 J The author turns next to migrations in North America. He points out differences from those found in Europe. There are no geographical barriers between the temper- ate and tropical region like the Mediterranean and the Sahara, no east-west ramparts like the Alps, and the North American continent itself encompasses a huge area suit- able for wintering. Dorst mentions the tropical origin of a large proportion of the Nearctic birds as the reason for their cyclic flights, and he describes the over-all prob- lem of migration in North America referring to the migration patterns of a number of species. Shorebirds, pigeons, cuckoos, hummingbirds, flycatchers, and further im- portant groups of migrants are used to evaluate the complicated system of migratory flyways from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He points out that there is nothing rig- orously exact about these flyways, and with his examples he calls to attention the necessity of further detailed investigations at the specific and even subspecific level. In too many cases we still have to rely on Lincoln's historic plottings of pathways and wintering zones which challenge ornithologists to apply modern research tech- niques, the result of recent field studies, and new accumulations of bandings to com- plete the picture of migration. The author calls to our attention seasonal flights in the southern hemisphere. Few, but fascinating intertropical migrations make us aware of the effectiveness of direct environmental stimuli. The discussion reaches a peak with examples of spectacular seabird migrations, the notable oceanic flights of the jaegers, the nomadic wanderings of the skuas, and the most fascinating flights of the Arctic Terns and other long- distance travelers. It is pleasant to note that Dorst had not the habit of compiling other compilations; he rather profoundly studied and listed the contributions of the original investigators. He points to correlations between transoceanic flights and pre- vailing winds, as in the case of the Short-tailed Shearwater or the Wilson's Petrel; and he marks our lack of knowledge about releasing and directing stimuli in other cases of migrations over the seas. Penguins are mentioned migrating by swimming, and the author briefly refers to the Emperor Penguin's reversed annual cycle and migration pattern as compared to those of other austral penguins. We may add that some of them also migrate by walking, and their cyclic goal-directed migrations also include those appearing during the reproductive cycle. Land birds as "hitch-hikers" across the ocean on board ships, swept by wind, or actively migrating across the great waters are further mentioned in this chapter. In Modes of Migration the author writes about narrow and wide migration routes, multiple airways, primary and secondary routes, ecological attractions and repulsions, and influences of weather conditions on migrations. Migratory behavior patterns are analyzed as to period and duration of migratory flights, and various sociabilities of migrants, flock formation, diurnal and nocturnal migrations, and migratory peaks are all discussed. Avian mass movements, controlled by external and/or internal factors, lacking the regularity of cyclic migration, are described under Bird Invasions for a number of species. Little is analyzed here by ornithologists, and for interpreting guesses we still depend much on results from analyses of invasions and population dynamics in mammals. With a short discussion of possible hibernation found in some species of birds, Dorst leads over to the study of physiological stimuli of migration. He carefully dis- criminates between endogenous and exogenous components determining or influencing the annual cycle, writes about connections between migration and molt and sexual cycle, and partial migration based on physiological variations in one and the same species, population, and, we may add, even individual. He thoroughly covers Rowan's</page><page sequence="3">560 Reviews [ Auk ILVol. 80 early pioneer experiments as well as recent investigations on the influences of temper- ature, light, thyroid and pituitary activity, etc. He wisely points to the possibility of an infinite number of special cases and an even greater variability of their deter- minants. In Orientation of Migratory Birds the author lists the various methods of approach and the results they have yielded. He refers to Griffin's concept of different types of homing, reviews the explanations involving unknown senses, and subsequently winds up with orientation based on known senses and referring to familiar topographical features (primarily of ecological importance) and to astronomical landmarks. Dorst leads the reader through the late Gustav Kramer's famous pioneer studies and his findings on sun-compass orientation, Hoffmann's investigations of the starling's inter- nal clock, Matthews's sun-navigation theory, and the findings of the Sauers on the star orientation of nocturnal migrants. He writes about enormous advancements but does not forget to remind us that we still know practically nothing about the psycho- physiological processes that enable the birds to get their bearings from the all-impor- tant celestial bodies. With a thoughtful approach to the question on the origin and evolution of bird migration, whose answer "must remain in the realm of pure conjecture," Dorst con- cludes and sums up his treatise. He has revealed a single part of avian life in the framework of ecology, the science of our century, a part as complex and diverse as the whole class of the birds itself is. It reminds us to be on guard against oversimpli- fied explanations. In itself the book is a guidepost for future research, a magnificent scholarly work. It is fairly well illustrated with maps to which the publisher could have added a well labelled map of the world on the end sheets just for the numerous younger ornithologists who have not yet acquired enough geographical knowledge and experience of the globe spanned by the migrants. Nevertheless, young and old ornithologists will immensely profit from this book that objectively reviews a fasci- nating history of ornithology and its channelling into recent advancements that char- acterize ornithology as highly contributive to the modern advancements of the biolog- ical sciences.-E.
