<plain_text><page sequence="1">Le Fronton Sculpt6 en Gr&amp;ce des Origines i la Fin du IVe Siecle. (Biblioth6que des Ecoles Frangaises d'Athbnes et de Rome, 165.) By E. LAPALUS. Pp. 487; pl. 23 + 38 text figs. Paris: E. de Boccard, 1947. In this valuable work the author discusses exhaustively all Greek pedimental sculptures known from literary or archaeological sources, from the late seventh century B.C. to the close of the fourth. The book is in three main parts: 'Les origines et le developpement de l'ornementation tympanale,' ' Les conditions techniques de l'ornementation tympanale,' and 'Les thi6mes de l'ornementation tym- panale.' This scheme involves much repetition since the same compositions are considered again and again from slightly different angles, but it makes for clarity. The number of temples and similar structures listed in the excellent bibliographical and chronological tables is about sixty, but so little is known of many of these that the dis- cussion turns chiefly on about thirty compositions belonging to about twenty buildings. From the sixth century there are the Gorgon temple of Corcyra, the second temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, Temple C at Selinus, the Alc- maeonid temple and the treasury of Siphnos at Delphi, the treasury of Megara at Olympia, the temple of Apollo Daphnephoros at Eretria and nine or ten compositions from the Athenian Acropolis; from the fifth and fourth centuries there are the temple of Aphaia at Aegina, the temple of Zeus at Olympia, the Parthenon, the Nereid Monument of Xanthos, the temple of Asklepios at Epi- daurus and the sixth temple of Apollo at Delphi. It will be noticed that only two of these buildings, both small, are Ionic, and, in fact, only three other Ionic buildings of the period, all small, are known to have had pedimental sculpture. After an Introduction, which emphasises the imperfection of the evidence, Lapalus devotes some forty pages to the architectural history of the pedimental frame. This section is sensible, but not very illuminating. His assertion (p. 38) that it is now definitely established that the megaron had a flat roof should be reconsidered in the light of Akerstr6m's study (Opusc. Arch. II. 2, 1941) of the remains of Mycenaean roof-tiles. One striking point made in this section (p. 64) is the profound change in structure necessitated by the con- version of the wooden pediment into stone: from being a light screen the tympanum became a solid wall with im- portant supporting functions. Lapalus talks good sense about Pindar 01. xiii, 20 ff., but strangely ignores fr. 53 (now Paean xi, 8), which shows Pindar using the word ai-r6s in this connexion. In discussing the origins of pedimental ornament he regards the scanty evidence for painted tympana as doubtful and in any case confined to small buildings (p. 76). Apart from this, Lapalus's main conclusions may be summarised as follows: The original purpose of pedimental decoration in important buildings was utilitarian in a religious sense-the application to the prominent tympanum surface of prophylactic apotropaia. These take four chief forms: Gorgoneia, as in Temple C and other Sicilian temples, perhaps a Corinthian feature: complete Gorgons as in Corcyra: confronted animals: and fighting animals. At Athens, from the early sixth century at latest, small buildings, which were mostly less definitely religious than temples, admit to their pediments favourite legends from the epic cycle designed largely as attractive illustrations. In the large buildings, which were all temples, pedimental com- position, as it becomes more elaborate, begins stiff and formal, under the influence of the precise rhythm of column and triglyph frieze, and falls into exactly balanced groups, flanking an axially central motive, but in small buildings there is more freedom and less respect for the architectural setting. At first, in buildings of all sizes, the decoration adheres closely to the tympanum surface: it is not till the second half of the sixth century that the designers of pedi- mental ornament began to appreciate the effectiveness of high relief and free sculpture, which take up the strong con- trasts of light and shade characteristic of the colonnade below. Even later the tendency to relief treatment some- times persists, for instance in the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. The indifference, in small buildings, to the architectural fitness of pedimental sculptures which is shown on the Athenian Acropolis is not universal in Greece, since the small early sixth-century Orthia temple at Sparta shows the motive of confronted lions. After the fifth century the designers of pedimental groups of all sizes, though free in handling and rhythm, seldom forget the claims of the framework and setting. As for the subjects of the pedimental groups, the develop- ment in large buildings begins with the appearance, in the centre, of an anthropomorphic deity, at first hieratic and detached but later taking part in some general action. This scheme may be subtly modified, as in the Parthenon, but it is not till the fourth century that such compositions as those of Epidaurus and Tegea dispense with the central deity altogether. The eastern facade is always more im- portant than the western. This rough summary gives no adequate idea of the fullness and excellence of Lapalus's work, and the few detailed criticisms which follow must not obscure the book's general merit. On p. 10o5 the assertion that an opening, for light or venti- lation, in the tympanum wall 'lost all justification when the tympanum was placed over an external colonnade' seems illogical. Lapalus often insists on the decisive influence, especially on the subjects of the pedimental groups, of what he calls the local ' clerg6 ': the name may pass for Delphi and Olympia, but is hardly applicable, at all events in connexion with At._ena temples, to late Pisistratid Athens (p. 136). He has also a trick of confusing drama and reality. On p. 146 he speaks of the Pythian priestess in the prologue of the Eumenides' referring, more or less consciously to the sculptured decoration of the temple of Apollo, qu'elle avait sous lesyeux,' and on p. 455 he assumes that in the pediment of the Cabirion at Thebes, which he assigns to the beginning of the fifth century, Parthenopaeus (inferred only from an inscription on the horizontal cornice) must have carried a shield with the exact device described by Aeschylus in the Septem of467 B.c. He has some excellent remarks on polychromy, but at times, for instance on p. 409, n. 2, he seems to forget its probable effect in clarifying confused</page><page sequence="2">132 NOTICES OF BOOKS groups. A more general criticism is that he is apt, though he tries hard to avoid the temptation, to slip into using as solid evidence reconstructions whose uncertainty he has previously emphasised. For example, on p. 199 he treats Dinsmoor's ascription of the Niobid group to the Bassae temple with extreme scepticism, but on p. 405, where it fits his scheme of development, it is described as' probable.'
