Levy 20 It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material. -J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick, Nature 171, no. 4,356 (1953): 738. Why art and science? In 1953 philosopher Stephen Toulmin wrote that "the heart of all major discoveries in the physical sciences is the discovery of novel methods of representation, and so of fresh techniques by which inferences can be drawn-and drawn in ways which fit the phe- nomena under investigation."1 Art historians alert to the junctures between art and science have similarly observed that new models and the methods of representation that attend their formation are central to artists as well as scientists, making possible fresh ways of perceiving the world.2 The year 1953 was also when James Watson and Francis Crick published their seminal article describing the structure of the genetic molecule, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which began the ongoing search to unravel the genetic code. With increased understanding of DNA, scientists have begun to explain mecha- nisms of heredity and explore possibilities of genetic manipulation and intervention. In response to the extraordinary implications of these discoveries, artists have engaged genetic structures, process- es, and interventions as topics for their art. Like two earlier issues of the Art Journal edited in 1984 by Sam Edgerton, this issue directs attention to the interface of art and science. Here, however, the interdisciplinary perspectives of scientists, historians, and sociologists, as well as artists, are focused on a more specific topic-the relationship between art and a cen- tral scientific paradigm, the genetic code. The most recognizable icon in the modern field of genetics is the double helix of DNA, and its structure is the basis for many of the articles in this issue of the Art Journal. DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands wound around an axis-the double helix. The backbone of each strand is composed of alternating sugar and phosphate links. Complementary base pairs (adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine) join the DNA strands. During the process of self-replication, the strands separate, and each par- ent strand passes on its genetic coding by forming complementary pairs with a new strand. During transcription sequenced (ordered) bases of DNA are copied into ribonucleic acid (RNA) for eventual translation into protein through the intermediary of amino acids.3 Recent discoveries show that mechanisms of genetic repli- cation can diverge from this basic plan. Some amino acids, for example, are formed by two instead of the usual three bases, with the third, although present, being irrelevant. In addition, retro- viruses can make DNA from RNA, reversing the usual process. Another example of divergence is the prion, a protein believed to be capable of infecting an individual and then self-replicating without the formation of either DNA or RNA.4 These and other differences from the initial dogma about DNA indicate that much remains to be learned about the code. It is in part this open-end- edness that makes the process of genetic discovery responsive to cultural factors. In addition, genetic discoveries are responsive to cultural factors because they dramatically impinge on our daily lives. We see this in our legal systems (DNA typing to establish identity), our medical systems (gene therapy), and our history (evolution). In the light of Watson and Crick, our basic means of systematizing have been examined and changed. A new phylogenetic ordering of birds, for example, will soon be based largely on DNA typing. This grouping is now used in tandem with older methods of classifica- tion. These wide-ranging effects have made genetics a subject of artistic inquiry. By establishing a common basis for all life, the genetic code refashions memento mori, transformation, and organic themes pervasive in art and emerges as a model of gener- ativity, authority, and controversy for artists. The ensuing artistic discourse concerns origins, boundaries between Self and Other, SPRING 1996</page><page sequence="2">notions of individuality and gender, and relationships between nature and culture. Contemporary artists are increasingly utilizing visual themes from genetics in their work, but this activity began long before the discovery of DNA and even before Charles Darwin. Some artists' works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were suggestive of the great chain of being, an assumption that all forms in nature existed as a continuum of intermediate shapes.5 Pre-Darwinian theories were made visible over several centuries in singerie paintings, anthropomorphic images of monkeys, suggest- ing a common hereditary link with man.6 Works by Jan Brueghel II and David Tenniers the Younger provide examples. Although not a singerie, J. M. W. Turner's Interior at Petworth (ca. 1837) reflects the influence of the great chain of being.7 In the eighteenth cen- tury an imprecise evolutionary idea, "Transformism,"conceived by Denis Diderot, was suggested in paintings of monkeys by Jean- Pierre Chardin (fig. 1) and illustrations in L. C. Buffon's 1753 print- ing of Histoire Naturelle. Darwin's publications of 1859 (On the Origin of Species) and 1871 (The Descent of Man) stimulated a range of artistic and scien- tific response. Gregor Mendel established a formal theory of the gene in 1865, although his work went largely unnoticed for half a century. In the prior art/science issue of Art Journal, Charlotte Dou- glas explored how, after such scientists as Thomas Morgan con- firmed and promulgated Mendel's work (around 1910), artists including Mikhail Matiushin and Pavel Filonov (fig. 2) were respon- sive to biological issues in their art.8 In this context Douglas dis- cussed vitalism, an evolutionary vision that artists found compelling because it invoked biological metaphors while avoiding strictly FIG. 1 Jean-Pierre Chardin, Le Singe peintre, ca. 1735-40, oil on canvas, 111/8 x 91/8 inches.

"Social Darwinism," along with Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, supplied artists in Marxist Russia with a model for their own revolutionary art. Others visualized evolutionary themes in the first half of this century through organic metaphors. Between 1899 and 1904 the German biologist Ernst Haeckel (fig. 3) helped to disseminate Dar- win's theories through published lithographs of Radiolaria, one- celled marine animals.9 Art historian Sara Lynn Henry has examined the biologically oriented work of Swiss artist Paul Klee (fig.4) in the context of artistic response to evolutionary cur- rents.10 Similarly, D'Arcy Thompson's published ideas (1917)11 became of interest to several Abstract Expressionist artists (see Martin Kemp's article in this issue). Relationships of art to the bio- logical sciences are also apparent in Wassily Kandinsky's work around 1940.12 The relationship between art and the biological sciences is part of a long history of scientific influence in art. Apart from evo- lution and biology, other scientific fields also provide pertinent examples of scientific influence on art. Historians have questioned and explored the general impact on artists of science and its "novel methods of representation" through examinations of artists' works and manuscripts. Art/science links in the Renais- sance have been, perhaps, most frequently explored, but other periods of art have also been examined for these connections. Kemp has shown that color theory and perspective encouraged Renaissance artists to envision the science of optics,13 and Conrad Hal Waddington explored how painters were affected by quantum ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">22 FIG. 3 Ernst Haeckel, Radiolaria, 1974, lithograph; from Art Forms in Nature (New York: Dover, 1974), fig. 93. physics.14 Art historians Linda Henderson and Craig Adcock have examined ramifications of the fourth dimension and non- Euclidean geometry on art.15 With the explorations of earlier artists in mind, the ques- tions considered in this issue focus on the specific impact of the genetic code on the last half of twentieth-century art and the var- ious ways the code can be represented. Representations (by both artists and scientists) are considered here in the broadest sense, including forms, patterns, conceptions, and operations of the model. The artistic rendering of mental constructs requires differ- ent means of visualization than the portrayal of objects, and much of genetics is concerned with what is invisible to the eye. In addi- tion, conceptual and technological developments now available to artists have enabled them to respond to scientific currents in ways that would not have been possible earlier. A variety of artistic forms relate to the particular conceptu- al, structural, and linguistic structures exemplified by the genetic code. Several sections of this issue focus entirely on artists' repre- sentations: artists' pages, "Models, Metaphors, and Matter," and "The Gene as a Cultural Icon." At the beginning of the issue, artists' pages include direct graphic renderings related to the genetic code, exhibiting fresh content and traditional artistic methods. Jon Tower and Frank Moore present two stylistically complementary viewpoints in this section. How does the genetic code inform art? This is one of the basic questions asked in this issue. In "Doing What Comes Natu- rally: Morphogenesis and the Limits of the Genetic Code," Kemp challenges the code's usefulness to artists, examining some artistic responses to scientific models. He contrasts the genetic model with a fresh look at an alternative and earlier morphological model, namely that of Thompson in his 1917 publication On Growth and Form. Kemp sounds a cautionary note, acknowledg- ing the centrality of the code as a scientific model yet asking us to be wary of embracing the code too readily as an artistic paradigm. The section "Models, Metaphors, and Matter" can be approached as a response to Kemp's challenge. The section is by artists and scientists who deliberately reflect on scientific ideas. As opposed to literally applying scientific principles, the artists use sci- ence as a creative point of departure for their art; as such, the sci- entific rules are not restrictive. New representations encompass karyotypes (photographs of chromosomes), computer-generated images, and topological structures, in addition to the portrayal of new concepts related to the genetic code through more tradition- al means. By interleaving scientists with artists in this section, the segregation of art from science is minimized. Aesthetic beauty is evident in photographs by Ruth Kavenoff obtained with an elec- tron microscope and computer-modeled images by Marvin Rich. Influence has not been in only one direction, from science to art. As explored in articles by the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, the historian of science Robert Root-Bernstein, and the chemist Roald Hoffmann, scientists have themselves been affected by aesthetic concerns. Kemp's paper is followed by a "dialogue" between two authors: Gould and Root-Bernstein. Gould traces the importance of form across all scales of life down to the molecular world. He conveys the importance of physical model making for Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA. While also showing like Gould how aesthetic preferences fruitfully guided Watson and Crick, Root-Bernstein examines how aesthetic consid- erations can create biases. He believes, for example, that visual SPRING 1996</page><page sequence="4">evidence should now force reconsideration of how the strands of DNA unravel during replication. In doing so he challenges accept- ed orthodoxy in science. Both he and Gould show that science is itself embedded in culture. The assembled essays fall into three main categories: the influence of genetics on art, the influence of aesthetics and culture on genetics, and the work of specific individuals who portray these interactions. These categories are not rigidly delineated, and examples of contemporary art form transitions and provide the major focus. Dorothy Nelkin, a sociologist skeptical of deterministic explanations, provides an overview of current artistic production. Nelkin explores social ramifications of the genetic code through representations in fine art, illustration, photography, and popular culture. She categorizes and evaluates the art in terms of aesthetics, shared communication, and the stated or implied social message. Other contributors explore aspects of model making with respect to scale, structure, and materials. As Toulmin observed, sci- entists make use of "novel representations." Hoffmann, for exam- ple, regards DNA as "clay to be fashioned."16 He views certain chemical alterations of structure that "improve" on nature as anal- ogous to the creative activities of artists. Similarly, considerations of scale invariance are developed in Rhonda Roland Shearer's arti- cle. Shearer characterizes DNA by its fractal structure and regards fractals as a new geometry that can provide an alternative to dual- istic thinking, suggesting revisions of basic categories of concept formation. Artist Joe Davis speculates on the archival capabilities of genetically engineered organisms. Davis has worked collaborative- ly with geneticists using techniques of bioengineering on a project to create the living, invisible art form Microvenus. Like Davis, chemist Robert Shapiro considers the linguistic aspects of genetics and envisions its text as a source of information. In very different ways Davis and Shapiro explore art and genetics as vehicles of communication, considering the implications of durability. 23 FIG. 4 Paul Klee, Little Cosmos (Kleinwelt), 1914, etching, 55/8 x 3 /4 inches. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. I conclude these essays with a focus on artists working with scientific models. In "Repetition and Scientific Systems in Art," I have addressed the usefulness of models like genetics for specific artists. Science provides these artists with a process by which art can be made. This text along with those that precede it may be collectively viewed as responses to Kemp's opening challenge. The mixture of contributors represents a working effort to bridge the persistent schism between the natural sciences and the humanities. Several of the artists work with geneticists (Kevin Clarke, Joe Davis, David Kremers), and others have scientific back- grounds in addition to being professional artists (Thomas Kovachevich, Michael Joaquin Grey, Todd Siler, and me). Some contributors are primarily scientists who come to art by way of excellent visualization techniques (Ruth Kavenoff and Marvin Rich), and others explore scientific influences across several fields of art, an example being the Renaissance scholar, Kemp, who writes here about twentieth-century artists and scientists. For art, science has traditionally and uneasily served as a source of authority. The public generally grants greater authority to science, although the reverse may be true for this audience. June Wayne, for example, singles out Rosalind Franklin's underval- ued contribution as a woman scientist as inspiration for her print (see "Models, Metaphors, and Matter"). By reflecting on the orig- inal oversight of Franklin's contribution, we are reminded, as ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">24 2 Donna Haraway says, that "in a sense, science is a kind of gen- der-the chief sign of rationality and order, and as such, gains precedence over the feminized domain of culture."17 With increased knowledge and familiarity of science, it seems likely that artists and art historians will bring more scientific concerns into the realm of art. Historians of science distinguish between internalists who consider their subject to be self-contained and externalists who stress the importance of social influences in science. Similarly in art, formalists look within art itself for its content, regarding sci- ence and art as incommensurable entities. Others view art as socially mediated, embracing scientific rationalism and varied cat- egories of knowledge. Clearly, a continuum exists between these extremes of belief. As formalism has become less widespread, both artists and art historians have looked to science, among other areas, to provide new representations. Artists will always respond and contribute to changing ideas and representations passed down through new discoveries. The pleasures offered by art and science are similar and include making connections, stimulating the mind, and problem solving.18 Cer- tainly science has the potential for utility and is valued for its abili- ty to make meaningful generalizations. By contrast, one tends to look to art for emotional specificity and grounding in experience, material, and presence. Interaction between culture and science is abundant at different levels, and the aim of this issue of Art Jour- nal is to present and to exemplify their complex reciprocity. Notes Thanks to David E.
