Die Felsbildstation Hodai. Mate rialien zur Archäologie der Nordgebiete Paki stans, vol. 3. Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1999. xvi + 430 pp., color and black-and-white ills., maps. DM 198. The third volume of Materialien zur Archäologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans (MANP) documents another significant collection of petroglyphs and inscriptions in the Upper Indus region of north ern Pakistan. Die Felsbildstation Hodai fol lows Die Felsbildstation Oshibat (MANP 1 ) and Die Felsbildstation Shatial (MANP 2), which were both reviewed in BAI 11.1 In this vol ume, approximately 1,700 petroglyphs and 200 inscriptions are described, categorized, and ana lyzed by Ditte Bandini-König and other collabo rators (pp. 1-134). An extensive catalog (pp. 135-385) provides a brief synopsis of each draw ing and inscription, which are clearly illustrated with ink drawings, black-and-white photographs, and color plates (pis. A-F, 1-127,1-XIX). The vol ume also includes an excellent bibliography, maps, indices, and an Urdu translation by A. M. Tahir. Bandini-König makes important observa tions about the local character of this station, where most prehistoric hunting scenes, Buddhist stüpa carvings, and later drawings of warriors, riders, disks, and animals were probably executed by local artists. Oskar von Hinüber (pp. 89-94) has deciphered the Brähmi and Proto-Säradä inscriptions recording names of residents and visitors, as well as Buddhist donative formulae. Unlike Shatial, Hodar has only a few examples of Kharosthi, Sogdian, and Bactrian graffiti, but the proportion of rock carvings to graffiti is higher at Hodar than Oshibat or Shatial. This exhaustive study of rock drawings and inscriptions at Ho dar lays the foundation for constructing a rela tive chronology of particular iconographie and paléographie styles. Data from these visual and written records supply valuable evidence for un derstanding the impact of cultural and religious changes in this high mountain valley in the Northern Areas of Pakistan over the course of three millennia. The Hodar "Felsbildstation" (a concentration of rock drawings and graffiti) is located down stream from Chilas at the confluence of the Upper Indus River and the mouth of the Hodar valley. Trails through mountain passes of the Hindu Rush connect Hodar with Gilgit, and paths along the northern bank of the Indus River lead to other complexes. Although M. A. Stein crossed the Indus at Hodar in 1913 during his third expedition to Central Asia, Hodar is not regarded as a transit station like Oshibat or Shatial (p. 4).2 Archaeological evidence of settle ment at Kino Rot (a rock outcropping above the petroglyphs and inscriptions) may be dated as early as the first half of the first millennium b.c.e., according to Harald Hauptmann in "Die Höhensiedlung Kino Rot" (p. 104). Hauptmann also proposes that Kino Rot could have func tioned as a residence for the local ruler of the Hodar valley (p. 102) or a Patola Sähi outpost due to its fortified position (p. 104). As Ruth Schmelzer and Hellmut Volk explain in "Mor phologische Landschaft Beschriebung um Hodar" (pp. 110-16), the large swampy area (formerly a lake) in the middle of the station is an unusual topographical feature in the high mountain desert environment. Bandini-König suggests that Ho dar's prominence as a place for rock drawings and inscriptions could be related to the uniqueness of the swamp, the strategic location of Kino Kot, or its position at the mouth of the valley (p. 134). In "Versuch einer Chronik der Talschaft Hodar am Oberen Indus" (pp. 117-34), Bandini-König re constructs a relative chronology for petroglyphs and inscriptions at Hodar. Prehistoric dating of certain petroglyphs at Hodar in the first millen nium b.c.e. is based on several factors, including overlap of later drawings, degree of patination, and stylistic criteria. For example, a darkly pati nated drawing of a giant human figure with out stretched arms (pp. 29-31, 351, 94:2, pi. XHIb), which could represent a local deity connected with the lake or swamp, probably belongs to one of the earliest phases at Hodar. Bandini-König suggests that the efficacy of this large drawing (over two meters in height) may have been en hanced because it was drawn high on a rock (pp. 124-25), an intriguing possibility which could be relevant to interpreting the structural sig nificance of other petroglyphs and inscriptions in northern Pakistan. Many other prehistoric drawings on stones 35, 64, 90, 92, 95, and 116 are hunting scenes consisting of armed hunters, 179</page><page sequence="2">Reviews dogs, and biconcave illustrations of caprini (wild schamanistische Rituale, bei denen ja der Kon mountain goats, possibly ibexes), markhors, and takt zu diesen Wesen gesucht wird," p. 125). felidae (often indigenous snow leopards).

Since most of these simple drawings are later than stüpa illustrations and Brähmi or Proto Säradä inscriptions, they could reflect new cul tural influences during the period after ca. 700 c.e., when Buddhism declined locally. Bandini König stresses that warriors and riders should not necessarily be interpreted as invaders, since few examples clearly demonstrate cultural or religious antagonism by overlapping or damag ing earlier drawings (pp. 29, 118). Decorated disks (section 16, pp. 64-70, 127 drawings) are also common symbols which generally appear later than Buddhist petroglyphs and inscrip tions. Many of the disks contain patterns similar to Iranian and Central Asian solar symbolism. These symbols may have functioned like tam gas, identity markers of family or clan affilia tions, when literacy in Brähmi, Proto-Säradä, and other scripts declined (pp. 130-31). Some disks are held aloft as shields by warriors and horse men. Axes (section 4, pp. 54-57, 30 total draw ings), which are still important symbols in ritual ceremonies in northern Pakistan,6 often appear in conjunction with disks, riders, warriors, and other drawings of the late or post-Buddhist phase. Bandini-König's suggestions that such drawings may be connected with Bhattas (Tibetans, Turks, or Dards?), who could have exercised some in fluence in this region following the collapse of the Patola Sähis in the eighth century, are intrigu ing, but difficult to prove (p. 133). Some symbols in later petroglyphs may survive in living tradi tions of northern Pakistan, such as wood carvings on mosques and furniture, patterns woven into shawls and carpets, and other varieties of folk art. As Bandini-König aptly observes, petroglyphs and inscriptions from Hodar are valuable sources for interpreting the history of northern Pakistan because they preserve "a fragmentary picture of changes which a valley was subjected to over time" (p. 133). The wide variety of petroglyphic motifs and the awareness of different scripts (par ticularly Brähmi and Proto-Säradä) demonstrate that Hodar and other high mountain valleys along the Upper Indus formed "... possibly a poly glot, but certainly a polygraphic (or polyiconic) society," as Jettmar envisions.7 Rather than an isolated Shangri-la impervious to change, Ho dar was obviously influenced by religious and cultural movements emerging from and sweep ing through South Asia, Central Asia, and Iran. Different layers of rock drawings and graffiti illustrate significant phases of Hodar's gradual transformation from a prehistoric hunting sta tion in the valley to a settlement on Kino Kot, sacred space for shamans along the edge of the lake, and a local shrine for Buddhists at the confluence of the Hodar stream and Indus River.
