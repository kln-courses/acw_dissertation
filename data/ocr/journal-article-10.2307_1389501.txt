The theoretical logic of sociobiology is reviewed, the scope of the theory is discussed, and its problems of inference, ecology, and myth making are analyzed. The explicit claim made by inerpreters that the theory provides ultimate explanations, and the implicit claim to a privileged status for these, cannot be theoretically, empirically, or logically justified. The article by Crippen (this volume) presents us with three theses. One is that the sociocultural sciences can benefit from nomothetic theories. (I agree, and have said so before [Freese 1980]). A second is that the sociocultural sciences can benefit from incorporating biological factors, processes, conditions, or mechanisms into their nomothetic theories. (I agree, and am trying to promote that now [Freese 1992, 1993, 1994]). A third is that principles of sociobiology' provide the logical and empirical foundation of nomothetic sociocultural theories. Heretofore, social scientists have objected to sociobiology-wrongly, in my view-because it seemed to be just a modem version of biological determinism. Correct is to object to its simplistic utilitarianism, its simplistic reductionism, its imperious attitudes, and its faulty logic. This article touches on all of these to one extent or another. Critics of sociobiology are legion. They range from evolutionary biologists (e.g., Ho and Fox 1988) to ecologists (e.g., Levins and Lewontin 1985) to philosophers (e.g., Kitcher 1985) to the editor of this journal (Turner and Maryanski 1993), and every feminist I know of (e.g., Bleier 1984). Kitcher's is the most formidable critique of sociobiology per se. More generally, social scientists should know that the neo- Darwinian interpretation of evolution by natural selection-sociobiology is just an application of that-itself has been subjected to substantial criticism in the last decade or so (e.g., Depew and Weber 1985; Sober 1984; Eldredge 1985; Wesson 1991). Not inclined (or requested) to provide a comprehensive review of all that, here I shall just rework portions of the score conducted by Crippen, for it provides some * Direct all correspondence to: Lee Freese, Department of Sociology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164.</page><page sequence="2">338 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 modem melodies for the 1990s to the root chords of sociobiology, the rhythms of which have not changed much since the 1970s. My conclusion is that the composition of nomothetic theories of culture and society using themes from biology requires a wholly different orchestration than sociobiology can possibly provide. THE THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF SOCIOBIOLOGY To follow the structure of sociobiological argumentation and its promises for sociocultural science, there are a few thoughts we shall need to clear the way. One is a distinction between sociobiology as (1) a body of theory, and (2) a field within which sociocultural problems for investigation can be defined. These are not the same. We shall start with (1), where promises cannot be kept, and finish with (2) where promises are so far unfulfilled. Another thought to bear in mind is that the modern theory of evolution by natural selection, sometimes called the neo- Darwinian theory or the genetical theory or the synthetic theory, or just neo- Darwinism, was forged as a synthesis of the original Darwinian theory with the population (and now molecular) genetics of the twentieth century. The term Modern Synthesis to describe all this dates to Huxley (1942), who contributed to it. Finally, human sociobiology is just an application of general sociobiology, which rests on some uncontroversial axioms. The Axioms of General Sociobiology Animal behavior, social and otherwise, had long been studied by ethologists when the advent of the Modern Synthesis provided a foundation to explain the biological basis of social behavior for any social species. The basis is evolutionary, and a set of informal axioms to reason about social evolution may be expressed so: (1) Variations in animal behavior, including socially organized behavior, are subject to natural selection (provided that there is genetic variation to enable selection). (2) Habitat variation provides the ecological force to place variants under natural selection. Note, there are three types of variants available. Available, as with any species, are the genotypes (inherited gene composition) and phenotypes (observable characters) of individuals, but also another type involving patterns of social or cultural behavior whose phenotypic expression by definition requires a collectivity. We might just as well call the sociocultural phenotypes what they are: sociotypes. (3) The organization of sociotypes is constrained and predisposed by the organization of phenotypes, which in turn is constrained and predisposed by the organization of genotypes. This formulation of axioms does sociobiology no disservice and will do for expository purposes. (There is no generally agreed upon formal axiom set.) It is presumed and understood that behavioral variants in animals are traits of phenotype and are, therefore, subject to selection and gradual evolution. The basis of this axiom is simple: The natural selection of many other phenotypic traits of physiology and morphology in animals could not have occurred if variations in</page><page sequence="3">The Song of Sociobiology 339 their behavior, including their social behavior in some instances, had not also been subject to selection. To biologists this axiom is "self-evident." It is also presumed that genes and behavior are not independent. Genes set limits to the expression of behavior and genetically predispose it when the proper environmental conditions are satisfied. This does not mean that genes "determine" behavior. It means that genes fix norms of reaction in the typical environments of carriers. By norm of reaction is meant a range within which variation in the phenotype can occur in the environment, but beyond which it cannot. Norms of reaction-limits-clearly surround behavior. You and I, for example, may walk, run, jump, swim, or crawl, and there are norms of reaction for these behaviors. We never fly, because genotypes put that beyond any norm of reaction for any humans. If there are norms of reaction for behavior, then behavior has to be genetically predisposed. That means genetic constraints convert to general pathways for behavior, not that behavioral outcomes are predetermined. In specific cases-for very specific hypotheses-genes and behavior may be more or less independent. But for the general case, behavior does not happen without somas, for which there are norms of reaction, and somas do not work without genes. So this axiom is "self- evident," too. The principal axioms of sociobiology are just the principal ideas of neo-Darwinian selection applied to social behavior. Nobody should deny that animal behavior, including social behavior, is subject to evolution by natural selection. That includes the social behavior of Homo sapiens. How could it be excluded? The theory of natural selection cannot be pushed too far. To say that Homo sapiens evolved at all is to say its behavior evolved some, and social behavior is just one type of behavior. Unless we wish to jettison the entire theory of natural selection, and there are good reasons not to do that,2 these axioms of general sociobiology are prima facie true. Enter human sociobiology. Interest in sociobiology was galvanized by the publication in 1975 of Edward 0. Wilson's tome on the subject, very little of which directly concerned humans at all.? But Wilson, along with others, did not hesitate to apply the core theory of sociobiology to the human case. To follow their logic and expose the illogic, we shall need a brief sketch of the main problems and core content of the original theory. Though now developed since its premiere, the core theory and its problems still drive periodic pronouncements, such as Crippen's, that the sociocultural sciences have finally found, if they would but only notice, their long-sought comprehensive general theory. The Core Theory of Sociobiology In Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975),4 Wilson announced, and others quickly followed suit, that the main theoretical problem of sociobiology is this: How can altruism evolve by natural selection? Wilson also announced the answer, and again, others followed suit. The answer was kinship. Therewith came to be defined the central subclass of initial theoretical problems because, as it happens, only these problems would service Wilson's overall program. Wilson stated his program was</page><page sequence="4">340 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 (in part) to reformulate the foundations of the social sciences, including the humanities, so that these last branches of biology, as he called them, could be incorporated into the Modem Synthesis of evolutionary biology. Sociobiological treatments of altruism and kinship, in the beginning at least, bore the brunt of this plan. The analysis of the evolutionary origins of social behavior, in which altruism and kinship figure so significantly, is grounded in the neo-Darwinian mandate for genetic survival. This is a mandate for competition between alternate alleles (different forms of the same gene) that contribute to behavioral variants. The natural selection of better adapted behavioral variants and their alleles can be shown mathematically to maximize the mean genetic fitness of a population over time. When an allele is differentially replaced through natural selection in a population, it is said that the mean effect on individual fitness for that allele has been maximized. The idea of maximizing mean individual allelic fitnesses comes, in sociobiology, to be interpreted as a property of the individuals that carry the selected alleles. Provided alleles that encode for behavioral variants, the behavior of individuals is therefore supposed to maximize their fitness-more precisely, their inclusive fitness since that kind represents the general case for which Darwinian fitness is a special case. We1l get to the difference in a moment. The maximization of inclusive fitness by means of behavior was enshrined by Barash (1977) as a "central theorem" of the Modem Synthesis. Some evolutionary biologists themselves (and some philosophers) descrated the enshrinement, and this idea certainly is not theorematic on my rendering of the axioms of sociobiology. Yet Crippen, adding Lopreato's (1989) qualifications, elevates it to nomothetic status. Some writers, seeking safety, have preferred to talk about fitness-enhancing behavior instead of fitness-maximizing behavior. Many talk as if this were some sort of motive for behavior, although nobody actually says it is. (It would be absurd to say or think it is.) Almost all talk about this idea in teleological terms, and Lopreato once called genetic fitness "a quest [that] inheres in the behavioral core of natural selection" (1984:106). Eventually, we shall examine the rhetorical association of inclusive fitness with purposiveness. In any case, in the theory of sociobiology three points about fitness are sure. First, it is individuals who maximize or enhance their overall fitness by means of their behavior. Second, the measure of their success or failure is their genetic representation in posterity. Third, fitness-enhancing sociocultural behaviors, when selected, react back on the gene pool so as to change the distribution of variants available for future trait selection. In other words, fitness is not one way. Genes and social behavior evolve together in a reinforcing cycle of enhanced fitness that produces stable sociotypes. In general, we are to understand the evolution of forms of sociocultural behavior and organization as due to fitness-maximizing on the part of ancestors. That is to say, the sociotypes there are, are now because of those that were, and those that were became so because at the time they evolved they were superior adaptations by fitness-maximizing individuals who left more genes to posterity</page><page sequence="5">The Song of Sociobiology 341 and, thus, a predisposition to continue their successful sociotypes. That is not to say that everything is now fixed and the evolution of sociocultural forms has come to a stop. It is to say that observed sociocultural forms were naturally selected behavioral variants, having associated genetic variants, that over evolutionary time can become fixed in a population and over shorter times may appear to have. Sociotypes are adaptations that can be positively selected. The ones we see are the ones that were. Now we have a hint why kinship is so important to this. Genetic survival is achieved through reproduction that yields offspring called kin. Kinship is the vital center connecting genotypes to sociotypes. Kinship is a sociotype-the only one definable in purely hereditary terms. With kinship, genes can be played like chips wagered at a gaming table. Watch now, as the evolution of sociocultural organization is traced by way of kinship to a central problem defined for the behavior of individuals: how to maximize the representation of their genes in posterity. It looks like something of a genetic crap game if one accepts this metaphor commonly used to describe it. In fact, it has been the subject of game-theoretic analysis. The surest way for someone to enhance his or her individual fitness is to shoot the dice oneself-to sexually reproduce. But reproduction is thought to entail assorted costs,5 and sexual access may be denied for various reasons. If the costs are too high or access is denied, how is one to maximize the representation of one's genes in posterity? Bet on the shooter. This is a play gotten from the theory of kin selection advanced by W.D. Hamilton (1964, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972). Hamilton's problem, which also exercised Darwin, was this: How could behavior that reduced the fitness of the individual be selected for? How, in other words, could one explain altruistic behavior in which somebody else's genetic fitness was enhanced at the expense of one's own? Such a condition may prevail in benign circumstances, such as when some material benefit is foregone for what appears to be some group benefit; or in dramatic circumstances, such as those involving self-sacrifice. How could altruism have evolved by selection and be maintained in patterns of behavior, to say nothing of sociocultural organizational forms? Such behavior ought to be selected against. The implicit attitude in the question of altruism was: How does the individual benefit from what appears to be (genetically) self-defeating behavior? The explicit attitude was to seek an answer within a genetic calculus for kinship. The answer was that selection would favor an altruist depending upon the benefit- cost ratio of an altruistic act, measured against the proportion of genes shared by common descent between the altruist and the beneficiary of the altruism. Gene proportions, called coefficients of relatedness, can be calculated. For instance, you and I share half of our genes with full siblings, one-fourth with grandchildren, and one-eighth with first cousins. When lineages are known, this arithmetic is straightforward. If the benefit-cost ratio (benefit to genes, cost of action) is more than two to one between siblings who are, respectively, beneficiary and altruist,</page><page sequence="6">342 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 then the altruist has a genetic interest in acting as an altruist because his sibling will perpetuate that fraction of his genes that they share. The ratio would have to be better than eight to one for that same altruist if a cousin were the beneficiary, for selection to favor the altruist. In any case, the behavior is a matter of genetic self-interest-a genetic wager of sorts, with known probabilities. The genetic interest inheres in the fact that there are two ways in which one can serve the mandate of individual genetic survival. One is to reproduce. That is Darwinian fitness. The other is to help those who are genetically closest to you to reproduce. That is inclusive fitness. An altruist, in Hamilton's analysis, enhances his Darwinian fitness by enhancing his or her inclusive fitness. Provided the proper benefit-cost conditions are satisfied, an altruistic action should maximize the representation of the altruist's genes in posterity by way of the altruist's kin-a bet on the shooter. There is no suggestion of any conscious calculation of genetic benefit-cost ratios as a guide to wagering altruistically, since this theory applies to organisms that are capable of calculating no such matters. The argument is that natural selection will favor organisms that behave according to this calculus, and because it has favored them in the past, they are genetically predisposed to behave in terms of it now. A pattern of altruistic behavior should be positively selected in a group of individuals because their average inclusive fitness should be greater than that of individuals in comparable groups that exhibit no such pattern. The modem theory of kin selection tells us that altruism can be expected among siblings more often than among cousins, other things equal, and more so among any kin than among those who are genetically unrelated. It also suggests that altruism as we know it has ulterior motives. It definitely implies that, from a genetic point of view, there is no such thing as selfless altruism. It was Hamilton's analysis, which is highly regarded, that enabled Richard Dawkins (1976) to entertain us with the anthropomorphic concept of selfish genes. That is why Wilson said kinship is the answer to altruism, and why altruism forms the core theoretical problem of sociobiology. This problem and its solution are necessary for Wilson's program. With the theory of kin selection, sociobiology gets into human families, and with families, it has sociocultural organization. It has, moreover, a firm grasp on the oldest and most important of all human institutions. Besides being any person's introduction to human society, the family, as many have observed, is the fundamental basis of human social behavior and organization. Human society started there. In part, it continues there. The sociobiological explanation given for this fundamental institution and for much that goes on within it or around it, is that individuals have a selective advantage when they behave altruistically toward relatives, for this enables them to pass on their genes by proxy; and, of course, families directly promote individual Darwinian fitness by regulating sexual reproduction and caring for offspring. In the awarding of biological bases to human sociotypes, first prize goes to the family. What about when families are not involved? Suppose there is minimal genetic relatedness between interacting persons or within groups. How then are we to explain the evolution of sociocultural forms? Wilson had said that perhaps all the</page><page sequence="7">The Song of Sociobiology 343 most complex forms of social behavior "are based in one way or another on kinship" (Wilson 1980, p.35). Sociologically, that is not strictly true if it means that kin relations can explain all of human sociocultural organization. There are many forms of sociocultural organization that depart from strict kin connections. But for some, there appear to be parallels, and this may be what Wilson was getting at. Nepotism, a form of social organization in which favors are exchanged and opportunities extended to family members, is easily explained by direct reference to a genetic calculus. Another form of social organization, patronage, may have its origins in nepotism. Patronage is something like nepotism extended to include others who are not kin. In theory, patronage should be favored by selection, even though genetically diverse individuals are implicated, when the genetic interest of persons is served by a patronage system. Patronage relations, like any others, can be advantageous for survival and reproduction, and so enhance individuals' inclusive fitness. Anyhow, lineages are sometimes traceable in patronage systems. They are also sometimes traceable in ethnic groups. Genetic interest can get in there, too (Reynolds, Falger, and Vine 1986). In small societies with a simple division of labor and primitive technology, many norms of reciprocity are so closely associated with mating that, to a certain degree, they may determine patterns of courtship, kinship, and descent. These norms of reciprocity can be interpreted in terms of a genetic calculus. But in more complex societies, reciprocity relations and social structures become inordinately complex, and some have nothing whatsoever to do with kinship-not in fact, not in analogy. What to make of this? About the same thing we have made of matters already. The theory of sociobiology covers the condition of no direct kinship with the idea of reciprocal altruism. This, advanced by Robert Trivers (1971), is a special version of the general theory of social exchange and rational choice.6 Reciprocal altruism refers to cooperative behavior that is beneficial to others and costly to oneself but undertaken with an expectation of positive return and without considerations of genetic relatedness. The idea is that genetically diverse individuals will cooperate when the inclusive fitness of both is enhanced. Trivers argued that selection should favor an individual who helps only those who help it in return and, when reciprocal altruism like that evolved, it should be a stable adaptation. If true, that could form the basis of sociotypes that go beyond pure kinship- for example, patterns of social relations in which moral norms provide for helping others. Sociotypes organized according to reciprocal altruism should be positively selected because populations that exhibit them should have higher fitness than those that do not. Those sociotypes should endure because they represent superior adaptations. Indeed, it probably does enhance the inclusive fitness of the members of human populations when they have an ethic by which they agree to help each other, compared to others that do not. Can this analysis be extended to include very complex forms of human social organization that behave on a macroscopic scale-say, to relations involving large scale economic and political institutions? Can it explain the evolution of the state,</page><page sequence="8">344 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 for instance? Yes, if one adds coercion, to fix parameters for reciprocal altruism. Coercion is said to be a fundamental property of the economic and political relations of complex societies, where it is employed by exploiters of various stripes and is maintained by manipulation and control on the part of modem states. Here, too, there is no genetic calculus, but again, inclusive fitness is supposed to be served. Coercive social relations should be selected for because some individuals profit genetically from the exercise of those relations, and so will attempt to preserve them. Populations in which this pattern evolves are thought to be better adapted than populations in which it does not, and so, complex social, political. economic, and cultural relations based on coercion can be expected to evolve and be preserved. In sociobiological theory kinship, reciprocity, and coercion connect. A hypothesis supported by Pierre van den Berghe (1979) has them evolving in sequence in human societies as human cultures elaborate the idiom of kinship in more complex sociotypes. For all sociotypes, individuals are presumed to be functioning according to an evolutionary calculus of benefits and costs-that is, genetic benefits and costs. The behavior of individuals, and the social relations they form, is said to be guided by a mandate to serve inclusive fitness. The mandate issues from a presumed conflict of interest whenever two individuals interact since, as Robin Dunbar (and numerous writers) put it, "each individual's interests will lie in promoting its own genes and not those of other individuals" (Dunbar 1982, p. 169). Not all the identifiable interests of individuals are said to be purely genetic or to directly concern reproduction, but all are indirectly interpreted in terms of their consequences for maximizing genetic representation in posterity. This interpretation is guided by the implication from selection theory that the better adapted stand to be selected, and the better adapted were those who (consciously or not) were maximizing-or at least enhancing-their inclusive fitness. So, their superior adaptations are preserved in their sociotypes. Sociotypes founded on reciprocal altruism or coercion are interpreted as stable resolutions to fundamental confficts of genetic interest beyond the control of immediate kinship. There is a considerable literature that speculates on the details of all this. In it can be found post-hoc interpretations of how this or that sociotype was adaptive or fitness-enhancing. The literature argues how assorted sociocultural phenomena not ostensibly connected to differential reproduction-for example, expropriative crime (Cohen and Machalek 1987) or the origins of mind (Lumsden and Wilson 1983)-in fact are. It supplies a very large array of evolutionary hypotheses of genetically based social adaptations that are presumed to have been fitness- enhancing for the populations in which they evolved. Put in ordinary language, this literature presumes to tell what we are, who we are, how we are, and why we are. This was, after all, part of Wilson's plan-to find the nature of human nature. Some thought sociobiology to have found it, and a hallelujah chorus formed. Evolution by natural selection had been known to produce human muscle and bone and sinew and gait but, as if that were not enough, hosannas were now sung for the production of morals, mind, spirit, and essence. This is a big leap-not from</page><page sequence="9">The Song of Sociobiology 345 the evolution of somas to their mental properties, which is a defensible extension of theory, or even to matters of ethics. The evolution of ethics had occupied Darwin himself. The big leap is to natures and essences. To discover the nature of human nature is to discover the essence of humans. An essence is a property that normally is taken to define some fundamental, eternat certain, immutable verity. Find an essence and presumably we have an ultimate truth and final answer, for which humans have been searching, lo, the countless millennia. Some members of the neo-Darwinian chorus so modulated core melodies for performance in human keys that essences could be heard in the song of sociobiology, and neo-Darwinian lyrics became fine-tuned into myths. THE MYTH-MAKING PROBLEMS OF SOCIOBIOLOGY In considering the theoretical problems of sociobiology social scientists will be quick to note, as numerous other critics have, that the problems are cast in anthropomorphic metaphors. Mostly, the metaphors take the form of economic benefit-cost analysis or quasi-rationat individualistic utilitarianism. The language in which the problems are conceived, which conditions their interpretation, is laden with notions of the investments, advantages, benefits, opportunities, and costs to individuals who are presumed to follow strategies that maximize their interests. The fundamental interest assumed to be maximized, as we saw, is their inclusive fitness. The common currency of all the intellectual transactions of sociobiology is the currency of neo-Darwinian theory: the differential survival of alleles. In evolutionary theory it is axiomatic that evolution is adaptation, and adaptation presumes something to be adapted to. So, sociotypes selected from genetic variations are analyzed as solutions to problems, posed for the adapters by their context, which affect reproductive success. Some solutions are optimal for this; others are not. Optimizing matters because to maximize the representation of one's genes in posterity is to adapt. The optimal adaptations confer a selective advantage in a competition in which some genes "win" and others "lose." There is an implied ergonomic calculus to all this. Indeed, some of the models employed to infer optimal adaptive solutions to the fundamental problem of genetic maximization have the same mathematics as the models of microeconomics and rational choice theory, from which they were borrowed. The theory of sociobiology expresses a genetic utilitarianism. So, what if the metaphors are anthropomorphic and the models utilitarian? Combined, these can lead to myth making through rhetorical excess, in which scientific theory and fact are used as props for ideological and moral agendas, that is what. It is stretching matters to charge sociobiology with having a moral agenda, but in its fervor to explain human behavior, culture, and society the credibility and potential of sociobiological analysis has been undermined because some extrapolations of the core theory amount to manifest myth making. Sociobiology does not need myths. Some sociobiologists apparently do.</page><page sequence="10">346 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 The Myth of Creation Most of the myths of sociobiology derive from a creation myth, a characteristic of all self-contained doctrines that seek deep meaning and ultimate explanations for the human condition. Creation myths tell about origins. In sociobiology, this honor goes to the gene, sanctified as first cause and controller. Thou shalt place no other entities before it. The gene, an abstraction in population genetics, in sociobiological theory takes the principal material form that determines the essence of things. Impelled to say which came first, the chicken or the egg, sociobiology unhesitatingly swallows the egg. Individuals are said to behave in the service of selfish genes, as Dawkins and others were fond of saying, which the individuals carry and preserve for posterity. Wilson (1980) offered a catechism to express this: Individual organisms are just DNA's way of making more DNA. The catechism implied, among other things, that complex sociotypes are just so many more evolutionary means by which genes replicate themselves. Indeed, it implied much more: The Purpose of Life is the preservation of genes, and life's ultimate meaning could be found in evolutionary biology (Wilson 1977). In On Human Nature, Wilson found "cardinal value" in the survival of human genes (1978, p. 204) and, through a circuitous intellectual route, found genes to be "the hidden masters" (p. 4) of human morality, ethics, and ideology. Spirituality, he also said, was "just one more Darwinian enabling device" (1980, p. 58). All human purposes were said to lie in genetic imperatives-a holy grail of sorts. And why not, if genetic design is the foundation of phenotypic design, which in turn is the foundation of social design? Look through the lens of the population geneticist, and this is what you might see. This creation myth falls short of the standard. One might attribute origins to genes in the sense of attributing functional primacy to them, even while acknowledging they do not function in isolation, provided one also acknowledges they represent an arbitrary reference point for the analysis of interdependent processes. That could stand. But, caveats included, sociobiology has genes for the vital center through which must pass all things great and small. Of the genes, it is written, we shall know them by their works, and the works they do are the design of natural selection, now a surrogate for the Grand Designer In The Sky. Natural selection, the prophets of sociobiology teach, molds virtually all of the characteristics of species. That cannot stand. There are evolutionary forces to mold species, issuing from the interaction of ecological with genetic variation. But there are no selection forces to "mold" anything at all (Endler 1986). There are selection effects. The organization of some phenotypic design is a product of evolution that may be measureable by selection, but it takes forces to set things in motion. Selection is a statistical artifact that is incapable of forcing, moving, or "doing" anything. Evolution can occur without selection and selection can occur without evolution (see Grant 1991). The point is significant: The creation myth of sociobiology turns on understanding evolution as caused by selection, with causality operating in a rather tight circle at</page><page sequence="11">The Song of Sociobiology 347 that. But evolution measured by selection contains no creative force of its own by which to set things in motion. Attribute such a force anyway to a process that describes the evolution of organized phenotypic design and you must, in the recesses of your mind, be thinking in terms of a designer-in this case, something like a Grand Selector, a possessor of agency (not necessarily personal) with which to create the order of things and guide its destiny. Natural selection hypostatized and entified has this deific quality to it. Now, if we want theology, we need some notion of a deity, and to a hypostatized deity we may always attribute creative force to enable grand designs. But here we have a dilemma. On one horn, descriptive natural selection cannot convert into a deity, not through any burst of creative logic or twist of words. On the other, with causal natural selection-selection as original creative force and agent-we do embrace a Grand Selector. Do that, and we have something as supernatural as The Grand Designer. This replaces one creation myth with another just like it. If we had been thinking in terms of evolution rather than selection, we would not be pinned like this. But we were not, and now our origins are equally mythical. Natural selection just does not work as a stand-in for God. As with other creation myths, we have grafted this one from psychological and, perhaps, from spiritual need-but not from scientific logic. Myths of Human Nature Other myths follow from the creation myth. They come from assorted writers, some of the better-known being-in addition to Wilson-Pierre van den Berghe (1978, 1979), Joseph Lopreato (1984), and David Barash (1977, 1979). The derivative myths include, among others, the following characteristics attributed to humans: a male imperative to dominate; male promiscuity; female coyness; needs to victimize and avenge; an instinctual basis for collective behavior; the biological joy of warfare; status and power striving; racial bigotry; instinctual aggression; spitefulness; and cheating and lying. These are sociotypes presumed to be advantageous for enhancing inclusive fitness. They are some of the essences. They are not supposed to be entirely immutable, as essences normally are supposed to be. These essences are supposed to be genetically based predispositions that evolved by selection and are shaped by culture. Most neo-Darwinian writers who have discerned the human essences allow for considerable plasticity in culture and for a dynamic coevolution of genetic, behavioral and cultural traits. Humans, therefore, are not pre-ordained to express these trait-essences, nor are cultures powerless to change the conditions for their expression. Ethnographic detailt as Wilson sheepishly put it, is "genetically underprescribed" (1980, p. 284). Generally speaking, sociobiologists deny a strict biological determinism, and wonder why anyhow such would be worse than an environmental determinism that now prevails in theories of human sociocultural behavior. We could relax with such moderating injunctions but for the infelicitous prose of some of sociobiology's interpreters. The theme that biology is destiny is very much woven into the shroud of rhetoric, and some of the denials are disingenuous. Biological determinism would, of course, be no worse than environmental</page><page sequence="12">348 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 determinism, but we ought to object to being offered so deep a poverty of choices. The choice offered by sociobiology is mostly a form of gene-culture coevolution (not all gene-culture coevolution theorists are sociobiologists). Gene-culture coevolution is predicated on the idea that culture is part of the biology of humans. Just that one good idea by itself can generate myth making. To take one example, an early and not unique writer in this genre, Robin Fox (1971), performed a thought experiment-the kind that cannot actually be conducted-in which he imagined a group of unenculturated Homo sapiens. He then deduced from selection theory the cultural forms they could be expected eventually to evolve. It turned out to be the culture in which he himself lived- even including such niceties as gambling, an armaments industry, and psychotherapists! It seemed to Fox that the culture in which he lived was optimally adaptive and, therefore, his unenculturated specimens eventually would happen upon it. They would if, and only if, it were true that biology strictly determines culture, does it on some principle of optimality, and follows Fox's implicit criteria for optimality. Fox is entitled to his criteria and his assumptions.7 We are entitled to ask what was left out and what was smuggled in. Left out are the normal understandings that biologists take for granted when they contemplate gene-phenotype relationships and speak as if there existed genes for traits. They know that is sloppy talk. They know, and have known for a very long time, that any phenotype is a product of the complex interactions of the genome and its multiple environments. They also know that it is not correct- it is unforgivably misleading-to explain some phenotype by partitioning its causes into percentages (cf Barlow 1980). It is not possible, for instance, to coherently say that such-and-so trait is due to sixty percent heredity and forty percent environment, because estimates of explained variance are obtained between, not within, individuals.8 Biologists know as wellt and have often said, that in most cases a hypothesis of one gene/one trait is false. Confusions never arise when at issue is the explanation of a disease such as Huntington's Chorea, which indeed is traceable to a single dominant gene. The confusions arise when complex human behavior patterns, never traceable to single genes, are at issue. In sociobiology, they are at issue. And every now and then, and more frequently now, a herald emerges to trumpet a gene for alcoholism, or for homosexuality, or for suicide, or for crime. What can this mean? It can mean that these behavior patterns are the result of a confluence of genetic, biochemical, environmental, and sociocultural influences. And that, of course, is true, but can you name any human behavior pattern for which that is not true? That sketch of an explanation says something about why people become alcoholics, homosexuals, suicides, or criminals, and also why some people become investment bankers. It does not tell us why a particular person became one of those rather than another. But there, with the interest in personal destiny, another intended interpretation for the effects of heredity on behavior can surface: genes that cause alcoholism, homosexuality, suicide, crime, and investment banking, just like that inherited dominant gene for Huntington's Chorea. Here comes the notion of genes as controllers.</page><page sequence="13">The Song of Sociobiology 349 It is not true of any complex human behavior pattern that we know of. No genetic master controllers have been located, and none likely will be, because the role of genes in influencing human behavior is far more complex than that child-like notion permits. In service of this point, let us adduce just one of the conclusions warranted from known facts of human ontogeny, namely, that the final wiring of an individual's central nervous system may be only remotely programmed by the genome. In humans and many other vertebrates, more neurons are formed than are used in the functional synaptic circuits, the unused cells withering on the vine, so to speak (Katz 1982, 1983). The completed neuronal structure is entirely stochastic with respect to the genome, for the number of synaptic connections is too large to permit one-one specification. In other words, the human brain is not genetically hard-wired. Therefore, hard-wiring cannot program complex human behavior or the culture constructed of it and around it. After all, it should surprise us greatly to learn that an individual's choice of investment banking for a career was predisposed because of a particular nucleotide sequence in the genome. The identification of any particular genes significant for a complex human behavior pattern would enable us at most to conclude that there is a genetic disposition, which is an attribution of relative difference in tendency, to learn the behavior pattern. Learning itself is a stochastic process. If we were to perform an imaginary multiplication-imaginary because we do not and cannot know the values, multiplication because that is what mathematical reasoning dictates in this instance-of the probabilities of central nervous system structure, given a particular genome, times the probabilities of a complex behavior pattern, given a particular central nervous system structure, we would obtain infinitesimals. So our explanation, such as it was, comes to no more than restating in a disguised way the general explanation schema: Complex sociotypes are a product of the interaction of genetic, biochemical, environmental, and sociocultural influences. This is where we began. It did not get us very far. What is it that gets smuggled in to deterministic explanations relating genes to cultural sociotypes? The technical concept of genetic fitness. This is where allelic fitnesses are measured at a single chromosome locus on the assumption that all other allelic variation is averaged out.9 The sociobiological commandment to maximize individual inclusive fitness traces to this. It is a hypothetical, idealized condition that enables experimental genetics to proceed. For sociobiology, it is the theoretical germ for a dynamic that generates fitness maximizing behavior and stable sociotypes that represent adaptations. In other words, the sociotypes, which indicate the essences, are treated as if they were grounded at single loci. Of course, in fact they are not, and no one really says they are. But, if one believes they are or can forget the "as if" proviso, one certainly may describe genotype-sociotype connections in a language of preformation, as Fox did and others have. There are, however, no scientific reasons that anyone ought to believe that, and every reason to take the proviso into account. The theory of natural selection in the works of sociobiology rides the wave of single-locus selection models unperturbed a great ways. It sets the foundation for human culture and even gets to the point of</page><page sequence="14">350 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 revealing that most elusive set of qualities we call human nature, which qualities for the most part are not very pretty-as if all that turned at the junction of single chromosome loci. It is dubious, and we should be on guard always in regards to, whether scientific theories ever could reveal such a thing as human nature. That is not because human nature is inscrutable but, rather, because human nature is another word for fundamental human essence. If there is a human nature, there is a ringworm nature. We do not talk that way in describing ringworm biochemistry and life cycles because we have no defensible scientific idea of, nor any reason to suppose, a fundamental ringworm essence. Essences are beyond science, being the province of theology, philosophy, and mythology. There is, to put matters succinctly, no scientific reason to have faith in what sociobiology takes to be the essences of human nature. These are just not the kinds of matters that are scientifically decidable. It is not surprising that evolutionary myth making, purportedly telling of the essences, has been called vulgar as well as, in Wilson's case, natural theology (Kaye, 1986). Why draw conclusions like that? We have, first, unproven and unprovable suppositions that particular behavioral and social phenotypes evolved by selection and were, moreover, selected as optimal strategies for enhancing genetic fitness. Note, the predicates that describe these phenotypes are not part of a vocabulary of technical scientific description but, rather, belong to a vocabulary of psychological and moral discourse. We have, second, an equating of these phenotypes with human nature. We have, third, a human nature that almost any moral discourse would call evil. We have, fourth, the suggestion that in principle this evil can be healed (with great difficulty), and its carriers redeemed, because the first causes and controllers, the genes, do not determine immutable natures. Natural selection is said to be forgiving when adaptations improve, and the commandment to seek salvation through maximizing inclusive fitness can be obeyed-and even defied, according to Crippen, and Lopreato (1989)10-in the mysterious ways of cultural evolution. Finally, we have a refied concept of natural selection. We have something that altogether has very strong Christian overtones without the Christian nomenclature (and, I might add, without its logical edifice). Myths of Ontology We also get myths about the things there are. I shall take up just one example, chosen because its author is so well known and so otherwise talented, and its ontology so patently ludicrous. To extend the theory of genetical selection to human culture required sociobiologists to conceive appropriate units of cultural inheritance. Their task would be simplified, they knew, if cultural symbols had properties similar to genes. With this in view, Richard Dawkins (1976, 1982, 1989) conceived of cultural replicators he called memes. A meme, in the stance he struck, was any well-defined unit of culture that can be symbolized and communicated to others and, thus, imitated and elaborated by others-"a unit of information residing in the brain"</page><page sequence="15">The Song of Sociobiology 351 (1982, p. 109). Being culturally transmittable, Dawkins argued that the memes are replicatable, as it were, inasmuch as they spread from brain to brain. Provided there are brains capable of being wired for imitation, memes ought therefore to evolve and be selected, Dawkins said. He went further. He affirmed the view that memes should be regarded as living things, not just metaphorically but technically so (1989, p. 192), since they are replicating entities that can be supposed to correspond to particular wiring in neurons. Dawkins went further still: he suggested that memes were self-replicating (p. 198), and even that they had an interest in replicating themselves: "Selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage" (p. 199). When Dawkins finished by opining that a cultural trait may evolve because it is advantageous to itself, I was out of breath. Living things? Having interests, no less, which they perpetuate to their own advantage? What manner of things are these? What sense can be made of saying that a unit of information residing in the brain and taking the form of cultural traits, symbols, and ideas of human beings, has interests? I have a great deal of interest in these words being read and understood and culturally transmitted, but these words have no interest in that. If any of their ideas are replicated, this will be due to people, who are the replicators of ideas and who may bear some interest in doing so. And, if replicated, the ideas may blend with others, spread by diffusion, perhaps, and be culturally inherited. If we wished to explain that process, or its disruption, what kinds of interests is Dawkins demanding that we conceive? Memes, like Mendelian genes, are hypothetical entities. This manner of things can have interests? The concept of interests has been left unguarded in neo-Darwinian thinking. In the next section we shall see how genetic interests transmogrify into personal interests when the inclusive maximization principle is interpreted to explain individual behavior in sociocultural contexts. Here memetic interests, residing in persons and forming parts of sociocultural contexts, tyransmogrify ... into what? Or perhaps we should say ... from what? Come to think of it, perhaps we should have doubted the very concept of genetic interests in the first instance. It is naturalt I suppose, to want to extend as far as possible any theory as good as natural selection, in order to make the most of it. Dawkins has wanted to generalize principles of natural selection until they can operate on any system of inheritance for which replicators can be defined (Dawkins 1982). We observe that replicator is an abstract, idealized, class concept. I cannot tell how such a class might have "interests" because the things there are that we know to be possessors of interests are not like that at all. In The Selfish Gene Dawkins opened the gate to an airy-fairy world of interest-bearing entities, mostly unknown and unknowable, and set them to roaming the sociocultural universe. This hardly satisfies one's desire for theoretical parsimony in the sociocultural sciences."' And the Sociology of Knowledge I should think it obvious that all the foregoing is extra-theoretical, extra- empirical, and extra-scientific. Scientific theories are sometimes decidable by</page><page sequence="16">352 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 evidence. World-views and their ontologies, which underwrite all scientific theories, are not. The myths of sociobiology derive from a world-view gotten from its core theory, but the content of these myths raises another chicken and egg question all its own. Like the evolutionary theorists of a century ago who wished to infer social morality from biology, we may wonder now as other critics have whether human moral conceptions and social structures are not by a trick of psychologic being grafted onto nature to reinforce an a priori world-view-whether these modern evolutionary theorists are not inferring biology from prior conceptions of social morality. Karl Marx, the story is often told, thought that about Darwin. Marx once wrote to Friedrich Engels that he thought Darwin (whom Marx admired) was finding in nature a structure and organization that paralleled the society in which Darwin lived. The observation seems to be valid again. In the song of sociobiology, the lyrics tell of self-interested, materialistic, individualistic, opportunistic, self-aggrandizing, competitive, and entrepreneurial strategists made of selectable, marketable Cartesian parts the whole of which, subject to the commands of first causes and controllers, is unempowered. Observe that the metaphors in the models describe the culture of the modelers. The metaphors and myths of sociobiology look like simple projections to the external world from the commoditized subculture of the universities and professions in which the academics who write this prose find themselves. This "sociology of knowledge" interpretation does not need to get too lofty. All it takes is to observe that, once again, evolutionary theorists seem to be recreating their social structure in their theories of the world. The qualities these professors have purportedly derived about human nature from conditions supposedly grounded in biology are, in fact, qualities of the people and social relations in modern universities and academic professions. Sociobiological myth making about human behavior therefore may tell about us more about the social and cultural experience of college professors than of the human species itself. THE SCOPE OF SOCIOBIOLOGICAL THEORY Myth-making by itself, however affronting it may be, is not sufficient ground to reject sociobiology's claim to privileged status for the nomothetic explanation of sociotypes. If we take the core theory on its own terms and try to use it as a paradigm for nomothetic sociocultural theory, as Crippen and others have suggested we should, its reach exceeds its grasp. The foundations of the core theory provide an implicit scope to restrict neo-Darwinian explanations of human sociotypes to a mere repitition of the workings of the maximization principle- a principle that applies only across reproductive generations. This is not an interesting or informative mode of sociocultural explanation. The theory of sociobiology, as with any other theory, has a bounded scope of application. This means the theory is expected to be true for restricted classes of phenomena under certain conditions but beyond those its truth, as a matter of logic and fact, has yet to be demonstrated. The field of general sociobiology</page><page sequence="17">The Song of Sociobiology 353 potentially covers a broad and expanding domain of phenomena that provides a proving ground, so to speak over which the core theory may range to find true interpretations for restricted classes in the domain. To the extent that true interpretations can be established as a matter of theoretical and empirical investigation, the program of general sociobiology can be achieved. At issue is how well the theory ranges over its domain, or how far it can reach, and what other bodies of theory might be needed to fill in the blanks. Any provisional conclusions about that necessarily apply to human sociobiology, which again is our referent. Meiosis, Recombination, and Kinship As Kitcher (1985) emphasized and I remarked before, the core theory of sociobiology is no more and no less than neo-Darwinian selection theory. That, remember, is genetical selection. This implies that the theory of sociobiology technically can reach no farther into sociotypes than kinship. Kinship is the end of the line because there ends the arithmetic of meiosis and recombination. With the climax of meiosis and recombination at kinship the genetic calculus peters out because, when coefficients of relatedness other than zero can be calculated no more, the theory of sociobiology can find a true interpretation no more. That does not mean it is false ever more. It means any other extension of the scope of the theory is a matter of faith not inference. The faith is well placed or not according as how the axioms of the theory are interpreted and evidence developed. We shall come back to that. For now, we need to realize that the operative theory of sociobiology is ticketed to ride no farther than the genetic calculus for coefficients of relatedness can take it, and at kinship its ticket gets punched. It is not possible to calculate positive coefficients of relatedness for those that are not kin, and when that cannot be done, it is no longer possible to logically infer the selection of evolutionary adaptations and explain the origin and maintenance of sociotypes as an outcome of genetic inheritance. What can be done is what, in fact, is done. This is to treat the selection of evolutionary adaptations as a hypothesis to guide investigations on a case by case basis. It is always possible to describe some form of social behavior or organization, to suppose it had (or still has) a certain adaptive value, to ask what that might have been (or is), and to try to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the form on the assumption that it was positively selected because it enhanced fitness. Endler (1986) has noted that a great many valuable investigations in biology would never have occurred without using natural selection and adaptation as initial working hypotheses. Finding and describing an organized, functional evolutionary design, as Williams (1966) wished for, would be a difficult problem without highly circumspect adaptation-selection hypotheses. There is every reason, therefore, to take the theory of natural selection as far as the genetic calculus permits, using the selection of evolutionary adaptations as a framework for investigation. It has of course been taken much farther, and that has produced just the opposite of Williams' wish, namely, Gould and Lewontin's (1984) lament. This lament decried the construction of post-factum adaptive stories for anything and everything that</page><page sequence="18">354 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 comes into view, on the assumption that all evolved forms were optimally adapted and naturally selected. When the genetical theory of natural selection is extrapolated to explain features of human culture, there are no limits to what one might suppose is an adaptation-no limits unless the hypothesis is bracketed, as Gould and Lewontin and others insisted it must be. The reason to insist is that almost no adaptation-selection hypotheses can be proved or disproved. The selection of physiological and morphological traits of phenotype usually is just assumed not proved (Bonner 1980), and traits of social behavior present additional problems of proof. If one assumes that everything there is came to be by way of adaptation and selection, one may become employed in the construction of undecidable adaptation hypotheses. This is why Lewontin (1984) called the adaptation idea, referring to the unrestricted manner of its use, a postulate of metaphysics. Sociobiologists were so chastised for invoking adaptation as an explanatory catch-all that their rhetoric has now become much more guarded. But their practice cannot really change too much, for without a focus on evolutionary adaptations they really have very little to say. The idea must be used if not as a working hypothesis then at least as a general orienting framework. But evolutionary adaptations have to be Darwinian-they have to relate to genetic inheritance. Sociobiological theory therefore lives and dies by the genetic calculus. With evolution grounded to natural selection and selection grounded to population genetics, the theory of sociobiology has no power to explain the functional organization of sociotypes among genetically unrelated individuals. But what about the theory of reciprocal altruism? Does not this get us beyond the calculus of coefficients of relatedness? The answers are, yes and no-yes in a very interesting way, but not in the way in which sociobiologists have presented it to us. Reciprocal altruism is the crucial link connecting genotypes to complex sociotypes in the theory of sociobiology-simple sociotypes like families being connected by the theory of kin selection. But complex sociotypes? If explanations of complex sociotypes are to be somehow grounded in theory to population genetics, then they have to be somehow grounded at what happens when chromosomes match up. Meiosis and recombination are the happenings at chromosomal loci. Tell us who mates with whom, and your evolutionary analysis is secured to the theory and evidence pertaining to the relevant biological processes-meiosis and recombination. Hamilton's theory of kin selection is secured to these. But anything that ventures further out-beyond where chromosomes can match up at loci; beyond kin, in other words-is not secured to these. Trivers' theory ventures further out. It tells when genetically diverse individuals ought to cooperate. Social scientists are familiar with all sorts of theories that propose conditions for reciprocity, utility, and cooperative exchange; indeed, these theories currently have a trendy status in social sciences. Trivers has supplied one more. It is interesting because it is multispecific, and it gives an entirely different reason than the others to expect cooperation and reciprocity. It may well be sound</page><page sequence="19">The Song of Sociobiology 355 in ways that the others are not. But the evidence is inconclusive, and anyhow, its significance comes less from direct evidence in the first place than from the role it occupies in the theoretical logic of sociobiology. To reach beyond the genetic calculus, Trivers' theory of reciprocal altruism begins beyond it. It has to reach back to the biology of reproduction, since it is not grounded there. It therefore is not a biological theory. It is a social evolutionary theory with implications for biological reproduction. Just because it supplies a crucial link in the structure of sociobiological theory is not sufficient reason to prefer it to some other social theory of reciprocity, exchange, and cooperation. Evidence would be desirable also. Yes, reciprocal altruism goes beyond the genetic calculus, because it starts there, but in doing so it forsakes the protection afforded by the web of evidence and inference available to any hypotheses substantiated by knowledge of the happenings of the chromosomes. The web of evidence and theoretical inference in which reciprocal altruism must take refuge is among the sociocultural evolutionary theories. That web is much less secure in spite of recent advances in the theory of gene-culture coevolution (see Durham 1991) and in simulation studies on the evolution of cooperation (Axelrod and Dion 1988). It is, of course, a central intention of sociobiological pioneers to connect biological and sociocultural evolution. To halt the wagons at the end of the genetic trail- at kinship-is not intended. But the trail they have blazed leads to a chasm running wide and deep: In the recent evolutionary past humans have developed macrosocial organization among genetically diverse individuals. This condition is now phenotypic except for the simplest human societies, which are receding anyhow, and the reach of the macrosocieties extends even to those. The phenotype is unique in evolutionary history, for the few other social species that form macrosocieties do so among genetic kin, and the remaining social species do not organize in macrosocieties. Culture, its rapid spread and Lamarckian evolution, and a plethora of ecological conditions irreversibly altered in the last ten thousand or so years have accentuated the condition of genetically diverse macrosocial organization to where it has become an irreversible trajectory for the human species that only catastrophic population mortality could change. Reciprocal altruism supplemented with the idea of coercion is much too small and simple a theoretical edifice to bear the weight of explaining all that has gone and continues to go with that. Ultimate and Proximate Explanations There is another major limitation of scope sketched into the map of sociobiological theory. It is defined by a distinction too weak to interest philosophers and too primitive for them to bother with, yet it provides a bedrock for sociobiological theory. Herbert Spencer used it over a century ago, and Ernst Mayr reintroduced it in 1961. E.O. Wilson borrowed it, because he needed it, to characterize the scale on which the theory of sociobiology applies. Since the scale is evolutionary, which may involve immense time frames, Wilson held that sociobiological explanations dealt with ultimate not proximate causes. Everybody, including Crippen, says the same.</page><page sequence="20">356 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 Roughly, this is the difference between long term and short term, or between processes behaving at slow rates and fast rates, between which there are lawful dependencies that are removed from each other in a causal order. Mechanisms of physiology are short term, for instance, compared to mechanisms of evolution. The former behave quickly in comparison, and their functioning causally depends on what evolved over the long term. It is possible to think of ultimate causes as setting boundary conditions within which proximate causes operate. They fix initial parameters. Perhaps another way to be clear on the difference between ultimate and proximate causation, in terms applicable to evolution by natural selection, is to observe that a temporal measure of scale is built into the theory itself: the reproductive generation. Evolutionary selection occurs across reproductive generations not within them. Any change that occurs within a reproductive generation can be taken as due to proximate causes. Ultimate causes reside in the evolutionary adaptations. That is about as clear as that distinction is ever going to get, and there are a couple of reasons for bringing it up. First, no inference about the causes of some change that occurs within a reproductive generation is possible using the theory of natural selection. Within generations the operative process is development. This implies, for instance, that the core theory of sociobiology has absolutely no application to something like the socialization process of particular humans, since that is a developmental process that occurs within a reproductive generation. Evolution does not explain development, rather, it sets the initial parameters or boundary conditions for it. Thus, it would be meaningless to interpret the behavior of some person in the context of his or her own socialization as adaptive let alone selected, if any reference to evolutionary adaptation or natural selection is intended. Hypotheses concerning evolutionary adaptation are said to provide explanations in terms of ultimate not proximate causes. For any proximate process, natural selection can be invoked only to define the boundary conditions within which the proximate process behaves. A supplementary theory of the proximate process is needed to complete a sociobiological explanation. Even then, inferences from ultimate to proximate evolutionary mechanisms can be justified only if they follow the one specific, rigorous route available, running through reproductive generations of kin. Any analysis of some proximate condition, presumed to have evolutionary origins, must take account of this in order to make theoretical sense. What about inferences from the proximate to the ultimate? Sociobiological theory is a theory of ancient origins. What is, the theory says, arose from the evolutionary past as a matter of genetic selection, and what is represents a continuation of what was adaptive. To locate the origins of what is, one has to look to what was-to the evolutionary history in terms of which ancestral forms gave rise to current forms and to explore further what might be adaptive about the current forms. Only then will one completely understand the current forms. Describe the proximate process, we are enjoined, and then provide a reasonable hypothesis about its ultimate evolutionary origins.</page><page sequence="21">The Song of Sociobiology 357 That is fair enough, as a general injunction goes. However, the passage from proximate to ultimate is beset with considerable problems of inference, which we take up next. THE INFERENCE PROBLEMS OF SOCIOBIOLOGY By alternating between recipes for ultimate and proximate causation, sociobiology is able to serve up a soup of sociotypes in which forms of sociocultural behavior and organization are characterized as proximate solutions to the problem of maximizing inclusive fitness, which provides the tie to ultimate evolutionary origins. However, by stirring together ultimate and proximate causation, there comes to the surface an unpalatable mix of inferences. In the terms of this untasty metaphor, some worms appear in the soup. Superfluous Inference One worm is superfluous inference. This is a frequent problem when ultimate causes are intentionally connected to proximate causes or are simultaneously invoked. I cite several examples, all taken from the same source for convenience, from which I quote to save the trouble of paraphrasing, and to which I add underscores of certain phrases in order to build a point (Lopreato 1984, all emphases added). [Tierritoriality as a predisposition may be defined as a genetically based tendency to acquire and defend space containing resources that directly or indirectly enhance fitness (p. 120). To seek control of the necessities of life in a situation of scarcity is in principle an indirect way of competing for genetic representation in future generations (p. 129). William H. Durham (1976) has convincingly argued that the cultural tradition of head-hunting among the Mundurucu [a preliterate tribe] had the effect of decimating their neighbors competing for scarce protein. Accordingly, head hunting may be viewed as a cultural accretion of the urge to victimize, whose function was to diminish competition on the hunting grounds and thus to enhance the Darwinian fitness of the perpetrators (p. 138). In the process of appropriating the means for settlement, [the American settlers] found resistance from the Indians who were certainly not lacking in the sense of territoriality and possession. The colonists, therefore, early had a score as well as a country to settle, and their superior technology and army were as efficient as their aggressive hypothalamus was ancient and subservient to the drive toward genetic maximization (p. 140). [Expressions of victimization] are mechanisms whereby some individuals and groups appropriate the vital resources of others or altogether eliminate others from the [sic] existence, increasing thereby their own life chances and inclusive</page><page sequence="22">358 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 fitness. The result is susceptible to cultural explanation, but ultimately it is predictable from the principle of natural selection, which sensitizes us to the fact of competition for genetic representation in future generations (p. 141). In the contexts in which these quotes appear, Lopreato is trying to connect proximate to ultimate causation. The ultimate cause invoked is competition for genetic survival. I underscored the proximate causes, and they vary, but note that they are all ecological. They all concern resources directly or indirectly. One can look at them as diverse from an evolutionary point of view or as identical from an ecological point of view. It depends on what one wants to explain. From an ultimate evolutionary point of view life may be organized for genetic survival. From a proximate ecological point of view, life is organized for energy capture and resource transfers. Now, there ought to be no doubt of some general connection between energy capture and resource control and utilization, on one hand, and survival, reproduction, and fitness, on the other. No biologist I ever heard of doubts it. However, for the purpose of explaining sociotypes, that needs to be said only once. Having said it, or presumed it, and seeking then to explain why, say, some preliterate tribe is killing off its neighbors, it is quite sufficient to observe that they are competing for scarce protein. If one can describe and explain the proximate ecological features of some sociocultural system, further reference to ultimate evolutionary causes is entirely superfluous. Nothing is gained in the way of knowledge; indeed, the invoking of genetic maximization is no more than an injunction by which to organize observation protocols. Given a condition of competition for vital resources, the manner in which that competition will be resolved most certainly is not predictable from the theory of natural selection or from some principle of genetic maximization. One needs ecological theory and facts instead. Evolutionary processes may set the boundary conditions. Ecological processes set the initial conditions for change in the system. To understand the ecology of the system an understanding of its evolutionary history may help- when that can be constructed, and in the case of social behavior, which leaves no fossils, often it cannot. It does not help our understanding at all to be told that sociotypes are all just different and clever ways by which DNA makes more DNA. It may be true, provided appropriate bracketing, but it is superfluous for the analysis of proximate dynamics. This, however, is the train of thought that informs the sociobiological analysis of sociotypes: Describe the proximate ecological variants of sociotypes, interpreting them in terms of their utility for genetic maximization. Genetic maximization is the ultimate causal mechanism that drives the ecological variants. With this attitude ecology becomes a body of proximate details by which ultimate evolutionary adaptations are realized. The attitude derives from another, taken up next (there may be a hydra in this soup).</page><page sequence="23">The Song of Sociobiology 359 Invalid Inference Invalid inferences relating ultimate to proximate causation often ensue because of a misrepresentation that derives-I can only presume-from an ignorance of formal logic. When I said that ecological processes set the initial conditions for change in some system, I did not mean to assume that ecological processes (or sociocultural processes) have no lawful order of their own. That is exactly what is assumed by many who take seriously the distinction between ultimate and proximate causation. For them ecological (or sociocultural) phenomena are proximate, consisting of variable initial conditions at (short term) sites of (long term) evolutionary selection, and no more. That is why, they say, we need ultimate evolutionary explanations: Only those provide the constant laws needed to calculate system change given the variable initial conditions.'2 The evolutionary laws are the universals, the ecological (or sociocultural) circumstances the particulars. I say this is ignorant of formal logic because-to put the matter technically- whether a well-formed formula is a substitution instance of some other well-formed formula depends upon how logical quantifiers and predicates attach to variables. It is this logical procedure that defines universals and particular instances of them. A distinction between universals and particulars does not depend at all, and cannot be made to depend, upon temporal scales, serial causation, or the differing rates of interaction for processes that are differently scaled. All those matters may enter into theories, some more or less comprehensive than others, and in theory there may be postulated ultimate and proximate causal orders. It is certainly possible to incorporate into theory long-term and short-term, and fast- or slow-changing, parameters. However, it is invalid to infer that ultimate causes are universals and proximate causes are particular instances of them. This means it is invalid to entertain the thought that ecological forces (or sociocultural forces) are instances of evolutionary forces. They are not. Some habitat (or culture) at some time may be the long term result of evolutionary forces together with its own shorter term ecological (or sociocultural) forces. The connection, if there is some, can be validly construed only if we understand a lawful order of ultimate causation as governing-in the sense of setting the boundary conditions for-a lawful order of proximate causation that behaves at quicker rates of interaction. But this allows that proximate forces and phenomena may be subject to their own internal lawful behavior every bit as much as are ultimate forces and phenomena, and allows that proximate lawful orders can be analyzed independently. For more than two thousand years, logicians and philosophers have wrestled with the ideas of lawful causation, universals, and particulars. They did not settle matters by interpreting universals as ultimate, particulars as proximate, and lawful causation as the exclusive privilege of "ultimate" forces. Some sociobiologists did, but it cannot stand as a scientific theory of causality-which is why philosophers pay the distinction no mind. They dispensed with it long ago under the name of Aristotelian causation.</page><page sequence="24">360 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 Inferences About Causes and Purposes There really is a hydra in the soup, pointing in different directions for cause and effect. If evolutionary adaptations for genic maxiniization are ultimate causes but one happens to be describing a system of proximate causation-say, headhunting-certain theoretical locutions become uninterpretable. It is incoherent to say that our headhunters have a drive to maximize their genic representation in fdture generations. If genic maximization is something that is driven, it is not driven by headhunters and is not a property of them. If it is driven by ecological or selection pressures, possibly we could say that its drivenness attaches to genes, because we have uncritically accepted sociobiological talk about genetic interests being realized through the behavior of individuals in a population. Should we attempt to explain individual behavior by deriving it from genetic interests, however, note that presumed genetic interests now become personal interests. An implication to this effect is common in the literature that Kitcher (1985) calls "pop sociobiology." Crippen does this. He assumes that to maximize (or optimize) fitness in the long run is to maximize (or optimize) utilities in the short run: Behaviors that yield pleasure are those that promote self-preservation and the optimization of individual inclusive fitness.... For example, the emotional inclinations to acquire material resources and creature comforts, to be accorded the deference and respect of others, and to satisfy our wide ranging appetites for, among other things, amusement, fellowship, intellectual stimulation, serenity, and sex serve as proximate motives underlying behaviors that, on average ... enhance individual inclusive fitness (pp. 317-318). And there is more: Humans are ... proximately motivated to avoid threats to physical safety, the prospect of social isolation, material deprivations and impoverishment, and interpersonal slights to one's status and sense of personal integrity (p. 318). Later, Crippen adds physical well-being, the respect of others, and access to leisure, love, and eternal bliss to the list. How does Crippen know this? What is the evidentiary basis for all those claims about motives? Crippen must know, and so I gather would regard it as quibbling to point out, that some pleasures (e.g., cigarette smoking) promote self-destruction and that some kinds of pain promote self-preservation. But it is not quibbling to ask for a show of evidence that (1) behavior that optimizes personal utilities in the short run optimizes inclusive fitness in the long run, and (2) that to optimize inclusive fitness in the long run is to optimize personal utilities in the short run. I know I am watering the wrong horse when I ask for evidence here. These affirmations about human motives derive from the a priori assumptions that "humans are opportunistic maximizers" (p. 327), their utilitarian individual motives having</page><page sequence="25">The Song of Sociobiology 361 evolved by selection; and that, because humans show all manner of interest in material pleasures, therefore this was adaptive for these "essentially self-seeking animals" (p. 325). Connecting the maximization of inclusive fitness to utilitarian motives is a theme that Alexander (1979), among others, worked and Kitcher (1985, ch. 9) so effectively criticized as evolutionary folk psychology. I am wondering why Crippen proceeds as if critiques of evolutionary folk psychology can be ignored, and continues at this late date still to offer proximate-motivation hypotheses as candidates for serious scientific standing in evolutionary analysis. I gather it is because proximate utilitarian motives "may be harnassed in the service of behaviors that have little, and perhaps even negative, influence on an individual's inclusive fitness" (Cripper, p. 318) in complex societies. If culture can subvert the pure workings of the maximization principle, perhaps our scientific task now should be to exhibit how this is so-how culture has derailed humans off their evolutionary track. This has been urged upon us before.'3 I shall not review all the objections-tiring to sociobiologists but valid still-that were so effectively leveled in the past against this methodology. I prefer instead to focus on the pattern of reasoning, undertaken in apparent innocence, that purports to form a "close and mutually reinforcing link between the proximate motives ... and the ultimate cause (fitness maximization) of human behavioral strategies" (Crippen, p. 318). This is a slippery slope. Rhetorical locutions that attribute drives, motives, or quests to the realization by individuals of genetic maximization in a specific population are suggesting that evolutionary forces operate on individual behavior. The slope slips two ways. First, the properties of evolution are not the properties of individuals; individuals do not evolve. Second, our evolutionary "force laws," whatever they may be, must transpose somehow from the ultimate to the proximate order of things. The more we think about that feat and what it might mean, the more uneasy we should feel about the ultimate-proximate distinction in the first place. It avails nothing to equivocate with talk about tendencies and averages. The most theoretical sense that can attach to a locution such as "these organisms are driven to maximize their inclusive fitness" is "natural selection would favor these organisms should they act as if they had drives to maximize their inclusive fitness." That latter, please note, is a statement about natural selection, not about any organisms in question. It may be true of natural selection, but what in this could interest or inform a sociocultural scientist? Hypotheses about what natural selection should favor in the long run cannot convert to reasons why individuals behave the way they do in the short run. It would be interesting if they could, but different units of analysis are involved when alternating from ultimate to proximate matters. Natural selection is a long-term measure of evolution, not a short-term cause of it. Accordingly, interpreting the "ultimate" evolutionary causes to some "proximate" circumstance can result in nonsense locutions leading to errors of inference about causes and effects in the circumstance, at worst; or, at best, should we stand down from those, leave us bored. Give us a theory of human motivation and its supporting evidence, if you please, even</page><page sequence="26">362 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 a utilitarian theory if you must, and we could be interested. But do not tell us your theory and evidence derive from evolution by natural selection, or we shall not be. Nonsense locutions form one head of the hydra. Another is the order of causation. The body, you may have discerned, is teleology. Analyses that alternate from ultimate to proximate arenas, attempting thereby to infer something about the causes or effects of genetic maximization, are often phrased in a language of personal telos. Such phrasing can create an important ambiguity about the order of causation intended for neo-Darwinian explanations of sociocultural behavior. How so? Well one can put the order of things a couple of different ways. One way is to say that the reason some animals become social is in order to preserve their genes. This is textbook teleology, and it appears in the prose of many sociobiologists. But, of course, taken literally, it is not true. Literally it suggests that some future goal-the preservation of their genes-is why animals become social. But that is not why, and we are told not to take this sort of teleological phrasing too seriously. Very well, I am not inclined to anyhow, so let us put the order another way. Let us say that, because some animals became social, they were better able to preserve their genes. I should think that is true on the face of it and not worth arguing about. Of course, it does not tell us why the animals became social, but neither did the first formulation, except perhaps to mislead us. The first got us to thinking that, since natural selection has certain net effects, selection is directed toward those effects. This is the ticket to teleological design. It tells us that headhunters hunt heads because it preserves their genes, while we just thought that headhunters' genes are preserved because they hunt heads. We can think there is teleological design if we wish, but now we have gone beyond the idea of mere evolutionary design and again embraced a Grand Designer-just what the original theory of natural selection did away with. It makes no difference if we place The Grand Designer at a chromosome locus instead of somewhere in the sky. If we recall the assorted environments in which genes simultaneously interact and stochastically manifest themselves in development, we must accept in our heart an evolutionary design without a first cause and creator. However, once we lose faith in our Grand Designer, we can no longer think that genes (mediated by culture) cause headhunters to hunt heads, nor can we pray for macroscopic design from those wonderful microscopic molecules. We have to take the design as undesigned, and as a total system in which ontological priorities for causation cannot be assigned. But then we are without warrant to give any "ultimate" explanation for why headhunters hunt heads. While the first way of putting things is wrong, since evolutionary design does not imply a designer, unfortunately the second way of putting things does not seem to tell us much. We want to know why our animals became social and the general answer is not in order to reproduce better and secure a place in genetic posterity. The animals' social organization may have had that effect-probably did. But so what? Our animals almost certainly became social in order to survive better.</page><page sequence="27">The Song of Sociobiology 363 I do not mean that was their purpose. I mean to key on a simple observation: For almost all living things, save those few that do nothing but reproduce, survival is a much more immediate imperative than reproduction. Selection would favor, by means of differential reproduction, those animals whose sociality increased their survival rates compared to nonsocial populations. To understand the evolution of their sociality we would need to know what was involved in that, what the habitat pressures were, what the conditions of their biomes were, how they used and transformed the resources available to them, what demographic, spatial, and geochemical considerations applied-in a nutshell, what their ecology was. The theory of sociobiology cannot tell us that. For that, we need evolutionary ecology. It is not just details we need. We need nomothetic ecological principles. How are we to get them if ecology is dismissed as a collection of so many proximate details that illustrate ultimate evolutionary causation? THE ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF SOCIOBIOLOGY Here and now, we need to clarify the difference between the theory and the field of sociobiology. The theory has occupied us almost exclusively. The field of sociobiology can be thought of as any and all phenomena the theory might apply to and be developed for-not in the sense of providing complete and privileged explanations to and for, but in the sense of advancing our understanding when taken in tandem with alternative explanations. The alternatives I wish to comment on are ecological. The ecological "problems" of sociobiology are not the same for its theory and its field. Ironically, its field defines a set of ecological problems in a positive sense, but its theory has an ecological problem in a negative sense. It is oversimplified, but not misguided, to keep the following contrast in view: Ecology is about survival; natural selection is about reproduction. We know full well these are not independent matters, but we also know they are not the same matters. There is an asymmetry between them. Individual organisms have to survive before they can reproduce. With few exceptions, they do not have to reproduce before they can survive. The body of theory we might need to explain their reproduction, or the intersection of their survival and reproduction, therefore cannot be the same as the body of theory needed to explain their survival. The field of sociobiology has been trumpeted as the arena in which to seek explanations for the lot. However, if the theory of sociobiology is taken as the only operative one by which to explain the field of sociobiology, then the program of sociobiology cannot much succeed. It is too broad a field with too narrow a theory to support its program of connecting genotypes to phenotypes to sociotypes. The theory has always held that ecological variation operates on genetic variation through phenotypes that exhibit sociotypes. However, it has emphasized one side of this equation, the genetic term, to the exclusion of the ecological term. This is because it explains the ecological term as an ordered product of the genetic term: First come eggs, then come chickens, then come foxes, then come better chicken eggs. Supplemental</page><page sequence="28">364 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 theory, telling us how foxes operate on chickens, together with what is operating on the foxes, are needed to connect eggs to the organizational design of behavior. That is the domain of ecological theory. The theory of sociobiology provides only a sketch of a program for explanation whose contents presume the entire subject of evolutionary ecology. It does not cover the subject and cannot be a substitute for it. It can provide a ground for it. But even there sociobiological theory conceives ecological domains as restricted to the realization of ultimate causes by proximate instances. On that view, ecology becomes the study of applied evolution, and the sociocultural sciences become applied evolutionary sciences. That short-circuits natural wiring. Between evolutionary, ecological, and sociocultural theory there are many empty spaces. The empty spaces are implicit in the third axiom on which I suggested sociobiology is founded. Now, one can always quarrel with my construction of the axioms. However, no biologist would, and no social scientist should, quarrel with the idea expressed there. Consider what is implied by saying, as the third axiom does, that social organization depends upon phenotypic organization, which in turn depends upon genotypic organization. It implies there are different levels of analysis at issue, and the levels connect in theory and nature. We do not have to take the idea of levels too seriously, and I do not, because its ordinary connotations do not stand up well to analysis. We do have to take seriously the idea that various natural entities may be functionally organized to behave at different rates of internal interaction and on different scales, notwithstanding the fact that the different types may interact with each other. Genotypes, phenotypes, and sociotypes are just such classes of entities. They represent different levels of analysis. Accept that and we accept that any plan to reduce human social behavior and organization to matters of evolutionary biology cannot succeed. The reason to deny the wish to subsume theories of human social behavior and organization under evolutionary biology has nothing to do with any special properties of humans. It has to do with the matter of reduction itself. Some sociobiologists say, and almost all seem to think, that all of science is inherently reductionistic, so theirs is no exception. Well, that depends upon what one means by reductionism. There are some distinct meanings to bear in mind. One is that the phenomena of nature can be scientifically understood only if one inquires as to just what entities and relations constitute the phenomena; that is, only if one discovers the parts that function as an integrated whole, and how they do this. This attitude, because it represents a desire to know what things are made of, is sometimes called constituitive reductionism. If this is what is meant by saying that science is reductionistic, it is certainly true a great deal. This concept of reduction turns on the concept of a system of interacting elements-of processes, entities, and relations-and parameters for their functioning. The concept of a system, however, is rather holistic, and has been anathema to the microevolutionary focus of sociobiology. The preferred attitude of reduction instead is a simplified and incomplete aberration of constituent reductionism,</page><page sequence="29">The Song of Sociobiology 365 which social scientists may recognize by the name methodological individualism: Social organization is the linear outcome of aggregated individual interactions. Consistent with this philosophy, sociobiologists regard hypotheses about synergisms and emergent properties with considerable suspicion. Unfortunately for this attitude, much evidence is accumulating that some very interesting phenomena are not linear at all. If we deny the synergisms, we are denied access to the nonlinearities. Methodological individualism gives us half a loaf. Ahright, let us try another meaning. Another meaning of reductionism is the philosopher's sense of theory reduction. This has nothing to do with the constitution of nature and everything to do with the constitution of theories. They are reducible one to another, one perhaps being subsumed by another (on a Hempelian interpretation of explanation) because the one is a special case of the other. Whether theories are reducible one to another is a matter of logical demonstration and is much more technical than I am letting on. It does not matter. If this is what is meant by saying that science is reductionistic, it is certainly false. Theory reductions are rarely undertaken because there is usually little point to undertaking them. In just the same way, there would be little point in trying to reduce some theory of human sociocultural behavior in such a way as to include it within a more comprehensive biological theory. Such a reduction might offer some proof of consistency or inconsistency between the respective theories, and might be valuable on that count. It would not prove anything about the world. For the case at hand it certainly would not prove that evolving sociotypes are DNA's way of making better DNA. Proving something about the world is exactly what the theory, field, and program of sociobiology are trying to do. Sociobiology is trying to prove that sociotypes are adaptations-even though the selection of very simple traits of organic phenotype are usually just assumed not proved. It is trying to prove that sociocultural evolution is reducible to differential allelic survival, but that is an article of faith. It is trying to prove that macroevolutionary processes, especially those around which turn large scale ecological phenomena and systems, in which human sociocultural systems are implicated, are accountable for as microevolu- tionary or microecological. That too is an article of faith. Sociobiology is trying to do all this with an operative theory that accords no real significance to ecology except as a backdrop for DNA replication. The lack of ecology in the theory of sociobiology is not compensated for by the perfunctory acknowledgment that genotypes and phenotypes interact in complex ways, vis- a-vis proximate environmental variations, to produce evolutionary results. That is not a solution to any class of problems. That defines a class of problems-the domain of evolutionary ecology. Tell us something, but you are going to have to tell us a great deal for there is a great deal to tell in the case of humans, about the interactions of genotype, phenotype, sociotype, and biophysical environment, and you will be telling us something ecological. Neo-Darwinian theory does not, so the theory of sociobiology cannot.</page><page sequence="30">366 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 The field of sociobiology, by contrast, is actually a program for ecological investigation. To develop the field is to do ecological science. With neo-Darwinian selection as its operative theory, the field is inherently microecological and therefore incomplete. But, if interpreted with appropriate circumspection and without extra-theoretical baggage-without myth making, Aristotelian causation, and kindergarden theories of personal motivation-sociobiological theory is indispensable to the understanding of microecological phenomena. When the core theory is supplemented with auxiliary theories and models, that can give us a piece of the action of human ecology-of evolutionary human ecology. Some fine examples can be found in the anthology of Smith and Winterhalder (1992) and the works of Maryanski (1992, 1993) and Machalek (1992). We shall have to be content with a very small piece if proximate is our code word for ecological, or if we think there are no ecological laws behaving in their own domain. What can we learn if we treat matters of human ecology as just so many variable details by which evolution by natural selection winds its way through sociocultural history? To understand human evolution, of course we need ecological particulars. But what if we wish to understand human ecology? Encrypted in the theory of sociobiology is an attitude that ecology is a name for the particulars of social evolution. There is every reason to turn this attitude on its head. Why not regard the story of human evolution as providing some of the particulars for human ecology? Imperious Theory, Easy Standards Sociobiologists tell us, as Crippen did, that evolutionary theory provides covering laws for the sociocultural sciences. But philosophers of science are not so taken with the covering law model of explanation as they once were. That model-I doubt this was ever intended-made it possible to claim a privileged status for any covering laws that could be shown to have the widest scope of application. Modern philosophies of science accord a more modest status to any theory or law that purports to explain something. Modesty, however, is not sociobiology's strong suit. To the contrary, we have seen it is imperious. Its proponents do not appear to think that sociobiological explanations are relative to contrasting alternative explanations any of which limits what can be explained-even what can be asked to be explained-in virtue of the presuppositions brought to bear. I am here implicating (without doing it justice) Alan Garfinkel's (1981) concept of contrast spaces for explanation. Depending upon how scientific questions are posed, different explanations and insights may be forthcoming from contrasting spaces of altemative possibilities-there being no explanation that can ever claim absolute privilege. All explanations are relative to altematives, and none can be total or final. To take seriously the explanatory scope of a theory and its limitations vis-a-vis other theories is, in a word, to bracket a theory. But to do this, one must forswear an imperious attitude. Sociobiological theory does not bracket itself because its proponents believe it to have incorporated the ultimate bracket: evolutionary-selection theory. There is</page><page sequence="31">The Song of Sociobiology 367 some suggestive evidence in the light of the world-view the theory provides, which is interesting and provocative. The theory is commendably less parochial than any of the sociocultural sciences it seeks to cover. The myth-making of some sociobiologists has been the chief reason some critics have derided the program. But if the theory is taken on its own terms, it does not provide grounds for derision, provided that we bracket the entire world-view in which it is presented. The failure to bracket ought to be derided. Compare, if you will, the world-view of sociobiology and its constituent theory and evidence with the world-view, theories, and evidence of the emerging sciences of complexity.'4 Then the assignment of ontological priority to chickens or to eggs will look downright silly. The most disheartening feature of sociobiology, however, from my point of view, has been the easy standards that come into play when the theory is applied to the case of humans. Compare Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, a first-class analysis of evolutionary ideas, with his Selfish Gene, or compare Oster and Wilson's Caste and Ecology in the Social Insects, another example of superior science, with Wilson's On Human Nature or Lumsden and Wilson's Promethean Fire. Compare other neo- Darwinian analyses of the social behavior of nonhumans against neo-Darwinian analyses of the social behavior of humans. A disturbing pattern emerges in the extrapolation of evolutionary, and especially genetic, concepts for the explanation of human behavior. When humans are at issue and the characterization of human nature is in view, standards drift lower. Causal attributions, conceptual definitions, hypotheses, measures, acceptable evidence, warranted inferences, and conclusions that would be unacceptably simplistic for the analysis of other species become acceptable for pronouncements about our own-much of it styled in a language guaranteed to provoke emotional reactions. Thus are perpetuated ancient, classic, and sophomoric arguments about human heredity and environment. And with those, the sociocultural sciences continue to be frustrated in their effort to comprehend the question of evolution for sociocultural systems-a question they have wondered about from the time of their own origins. Many social scientists are suspicious of biology, not because they understand the subject well (they do not) but because they understand some of its interpreters all too well. There is no good reason to suspect biology itself. There is good reason to suspect sociobiology for its claims to a privileged explanation, in rather easy terms at that, of phenomena whose real complexities we have not even begun to comprehend. Acknowledgments: C. Dyke and W.R. Catton, Jr., were kind enough to provide helpful comments on the material contained in this article. NOTES 1. Throughout, I use the term sociobiology as shorthand for human sociobiology, except where specifically noted. Human sociobiology is the smaller fraction of general sociobiology, which addresses the evolution of social behavior for any social species.</page><page sequence="32">368 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3, 1994 2. Neo-Darwinian selection is the core body of theory around which the rest of biology is built. Core bodies of theory are not easily discarded, because too much else has to be thrown out with them-everything that logically depends upon the core and was gotten from it. The outer layers of a body of systematic scientific knowledge are always candidates for peeling away, because at the outer layers hypotheses are tested and may be found to be wanting. Inner theoretical cores are always protected, and for a very good reason: They got us to the outer layers, along the way solving for us numerous problems that were taken to be significant. In the case of natural selection theory, it cannot be rejected without rejecting population genetics itself. By virtue of its experimental data and modem molecular foundations, genetics is a highly protected science deep within the core of systematic biology. No thinking person ought seriously to quarrel with it. To quarrel with linear extrapolations made in its name for the purpose of explaining the behavior and personalities of human beings is another matter. 3. Contrary to popular opinion, E.O. Wilson did not invent sociobiology. Nobody did. The modem impetus for sociobiology is sometimes traced to the work of William D. Hamilton concerning altruism and inclusive fitness, published in 1964 and thereafter and taken up below, and to G.C. Williams' (1966) influential treatise two years later. E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis was devoted to synthesizing under the rubric of natural selection a large body of ideas and findings pertinent to animal social behavior. It is among the least of Wilson's accomplishments. Known as well for his coauthorship of the influential ecological theory of island biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson 1%7), Wilson is a world- class entomologist who lately has become a leader in the effort to galvanize and publicize concern for the preservation of biological diversity (Wilson 1988, 1992). 4. An abridged edition was issued in 1980, and all references herein are to that. 5. There is a large literature that concerns the special matter of sexual selection. The topic occupied Darwin, who pondered as many still do why sexual reproduction ever evolved. The idea that there are assorted costs to sexual reproduction goes back at least to August Weismann at the beginning of the twentieth century. The idea that males and females bear differential reproductive costs is prominent in many sociobiological analyses, and selective advantages that accrue from mate selection are thought to be quantifiable in terms of coefficients of genetic relatedness. A sampling of how general sociobiology addresses these matters can be found in Williams (1981), and some indication of how this is interpreted to humans can be found in van den Berghe (1979). 6. It may seem odd to lump this theory under the heading social exchange and rational choice, but this is a very odd theory of social exchange and rational choice. I do not mean odd in a pejorative sense. Standard rational choice theory attributes agency to decision making actors, either individual or corporate, whose decisions may be considered and contemplated or may not be so at all; still, it attributes agency. Trivers' theory does nothing of the sort. Rather, the theory assumes that natural selection should favor this or that behavior pattern-a pattern rational for survival and for promoting fitness. Rationality, in this theory, is an emergent quality of adaptations that are positively selected-a functional property that naturally accrues from selection itself, not to agents themselves. 7. I do not wish to make Fox's argument sound worse than it was or to misrepresent it. Fox used this thought experiment as a crutch to argue that culture is a natural part of the biology of humans, and he allowed his determinism to run both ways-from biology to culture and back again, each serving as a basis of selection for the other, to wit: Enlarged brain size enables selection for culture, and further enculturation selects for bigger brains.</page><page sequence="33">The Song of Sociobiology 369 But if we accept that, and we certainly should, nothing follows about universal behavioral and cultural predispositions, which is precisely what Fox was imagining in his experiment. 8. Richard Lewontin, a mathematical biologist of considerable repute, described the attempt to estimate proportions of phenotypic variance due to genetic causes as "biological nonsense' (1982, pp. 14-15). Attempts persist nonetheless to portion out heredity and environment with respect to matters of personal destiny-for example, homosexuality or IQ inheritance. The point here, not original, is that heritability estimates are derived from statistical interactions and cannot be used to infer causal interactions. That there are causal interactions involving heredity and behavior should be doubted by no one (see Plomin 1990), but that they could be inferred in the form of heritability estimates obtained from variances between individuals should be doubted by everyone. Heritability estimates for IQ have been a scientific embarrassment ever since the decisive critique of Gould (1981). Some philosophers go farther than the mere discounting of heritability estimates obtained from statistical interactions. Richard Burien (1981-1982) doubted whether the genetic determination of traits was even a coherent idea, and Philip Kitcher flatly averred that such inferences should be "disavowed once and for all" (1990, p. 97). 9. Fitness is a technical concept that has multiple meanings in evolutionary biology. Dawkins (1982) and Endler (1986) both identify five senses of fitness. The sense pertinent here is the mathematical-genetic concept. Population genetics nowadays does not deal just with single locus models of gene frequency change in randomly mating populations; however, sociobiological explanations of human character essences mostly trace-when they trace at all-to the single locus concept, occasional lip service to multiple-loci models notwithstanding. 10. Crippen exalts Lopreato's (1989) conditionalizing of the maximization principle the purpose of which is to account for the fact that there may be countervailing cultural conditions that prohibit the full realization of the principle. But look again. The third condition suggested by Lopreato is that inclusive fitness maximization is conditioned by the autonomization of phenotype from genotype. In other words, organisms are predisposed to behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness, except when they cannot! Can this effort to conditionalize the proposition be salvaged? I can think of only one way, and that is to interpret the proposition as describing an idealized state of affairs departures from which when measured can provide useful information when compared to the idealized baseline. This is the maneuver appropriate, for example, with the Hardy-Weinberg law that holds for a condition of no evolutionary change and with the law of falling bodies that holds in the absence of friction. These laws are not "defied" when their conditions are not satisfied; such a notion is incoherent. Nor are they rendered invalid or have they been "overcome" or "subverted." The beauty of those laws is that they are quantitative, so that measured departures from their idealized conditions enable point calculations in certain instances. What point predictions are possible with the maximization principle, conditionalized or not? 11. For a time-until The Selfish Gene was reissued-it appeared as if Dawkins might not have been serious about all this. In The Exteed Phenotype, a serious work, Dawkins acknowledges how memes might not be homologous with genes. This leads him to admit that the analogy of meme selection with gene selection may be "worthless or even positively misleading," and "its main value may lie not so much in helping us to understand human culture as in sharpening our perception of genetic natural selection" (1982, p. 112). He finished by confessing that he did not know much about the literature on human culture.</page><page sequence="34">370 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3, 1994 12. Lopreato (1984) seems to take this view (at least with regard to sociocultural phenomena), as do others, though Wilson did not. Wilson said: "Ultimate causation consists of the necessities created by the environment: the pressures imposed by weather, predators, and other stressors, and such opportunities as are presented by unfilled living space, new food sources, and accessible mates" (1980, p. 16, emphasis added). Wilson was trying to characterize the difference in causal frames employed by evolutionary and functional biology. He did not associate evolutionary with ultimate causation and ecological with proximate causation. He could be interpreted to have done the opposite. Subsequent interpreters who read him one way or the other perhaps can be excused, since Wilson's discussion is not at all clear-probably because the distinction itself cannot be made to be clear. 13. Not just this, but about everything in Crippen's entire album is a replay of oldies but goodies. So is my critique of it, for the most part, which prompted one friendly reviewer to observe that there are N reasons to reject sociobiology, and I am providing only N - 4 of them. I was a not-so-friendly reviewer of Crippen's article upon its submission to this journal, but the editor saw matters otherwise. 14. These sciences deal with evolution on a scale much more comprehensive than neo- Darwinism allows (see Jantsch 1980; Laslo 1987; Brooks and Wiley 1986; Weber, Depew, and Smith 1988; Kauffman 1993).
