INTRODUCTION Courts have generally employed one of two tests to determine whether a product is defective under the law of strict products liability in the United States. The first test inquires whether the product meets reasonable con sumer expectations of safety. The second test requires a balancing of the risks of the product against its benefits. Courts are divided around the nation as to which test to utilize when a design defect is alleged in an air bag passive restraint system.4 One of the most recent pronouncements of law concerning the appro priate test to determine whether an air bag system was defectively designed originated in Ohio in Hisrich v. Volvo Cars of North America, Inc.5 The ar guments and evidence presented in that case provide an overview of the current state of the law on whether the "consumer expectations" test is appropriate in cases alleging a defect in the design of an air bag system. This article will begin with a discussion of Hisrich v. Volvo and will then examine whether consumer expectations should be a viable theory of de termining a design defect in an air bag system given the unsettled and often erroneous public opinion as to air bag safety. This article will further an alyze the practical impact at trial of utilizing a consumer's expectations of an air bag system when jurors will not necessarily be educated with expert testimony. Moreover, because air bags were originally designed to reduce the growing fatalities on our highways and continue to save lives, the article will suggest that air bags, like other products of high social utility, merit a 4. During the later part of the twentieth century, there was a progression away from the doctrine of privity to concepts of strict liability and design defect. See Richard A. Epstein, Modern Products Liability Law 25-36 (1981). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) (elimination of traditional requirement of privity allowed consumers to bring actions direcdy against manufacturers and distributors). Products liability was further expanded to include "crashworthiness" claims such as those levied against air bag occupant safety systems. In a "crashworthiness,' or "second collision" case, a manufacturer of a product may be liable under strict liability principles for injuries sustained in an accident where a defect in the product enhanced the plaintiff's injuries, even though the defect was not the cause of the accident. See Larsen v. Gen. Motors Corp., 391 F.2d 495, 503 (8th Cir. 1968) (applying Michigan law); see also 63 A Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability ? 1020 (1997). See generally James O. Pearson, Products Liability: Sufficiency of Proof of Injuries Resulting From "Second Collision" 9 A.L.R.4th 494 (1981). Thus, failure to design an automobile to protect occupants from foreseeable dangers caused by a second collision subjects the manufacturer and dealer to strict liability. See Henry Cheeseman, The Legal and Regulatory Environment, Product Li ability 166 (3d ed. 2002). Similar to the role of consumer expectations in claims of defective air bag design, the precedent establishing the "crashworthiness" theory and its elements has been primarily developed by federal courts sitting in diversity. See Larsen, 391 F.2d at 495. Ohio adopted the doctrine in 1981. See Leichtamer v. Am. Motors Corp., 424 N.E.2d 568 (Ohio 1981); see also Stephen J.

The article will offer a critique of the reasoning of those cases, such as Hisrich v. Volvo, that have allowed an air bag passive restraint system to be tested for design defect based simply on the expectations of consumers. Finally, the article will dis cuss the implications for parties facing litigation in those jurisdictions that continue to test defective air bag design claims based on consumer beliefs. II. CASE REVIEW: HISRICH V VOLVO CARS OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. On the afternoon of April 22, 1993?only one day after her sixth birth day?Diana Zhang was killed by a passenger side air bag that deployed in her mother's Volvo 850 GLT6 Diana's mother had placed her child in the front passenger seat without a seat belt, contrary to all instructions and warnings contained on the car and in the safety manual.7 This safely in formation warned consumers to never place a child in the front seat at all.8 Diana's mother, however, apparendy ignored these instructions on that fateful day as she drove to see her father who had just returned from China.9 As she was traveling on Whipple Road in Canton, Ohio, she failed to see a red light and struck another car from behind.10 The velocity at impact was about ten miles per hour?a minor fender bender by today's standards.11 Nevertheless, according to the design spec ifications of Volvo, both front air bags deployed.12 The driver's side air bag saved Diana's mother from injury, while the passenger-side air bag killed her child.13 Diana Zhang was the first child in the United States to be killed 6.

See Brief of Appellee at 4, citing to, inter alia, various portions of trial transcript and appellate record. However, it was shown that the simulation of the accident upon which plaintiff had relied had not been made under the same conditions as the actual accident. See id. at 4.

Plaintiff's Case16 Diana's mother alleged that the design of the air bag system was defective in both its time and rate of deployment. In particular, plaintiff contended that the air bag deployed too fast and, more importandy, that it should not have deployed at all in a minor collision. Diana's mother testified at trial that she purchased the Volvo because it had two air bags instead of just one. She assumed that two air bags meant that the car was safer for her family. Diana's mother averred that despite the warnings of the danger of air bags in the manual and on the car itself, she never anticipated that an air bag could kill anyone?especially not her daughter Diana. She further asserted that she never imagined that the car she purchased to protect her daughter would be the instrumentality of her death. She certainly had no idea that the air bag would deploy in a low speed collision. The plaintiff's counsel asserted that no reasonable consumer would ex pect such a result. Accordingly, he argued that Volvo's air bag system should be found defective under the consumer expectation test. B. Defendant's Case Volvo responded through the testimony of its design team as well as in dependent industry experts. These engineers explained that air bags are highly engineered devices that involve tradeoffs on complex technical is sues. They further testified that air bags are required to perform in an almost infinite number of circumstances depending on the type of motor vehicles involved, the angle, the environment, as well as the relative speed at impact. The experts testified that the parameters for the design of air bag systems are provided by federal law with the details determined by the laws of physics. In terms of the speed of deployment, these experts explained that a col 14. See Brief of Appellant at 8, citing Trial Transcript. One year after the death of Diana Zhang, there were six child fatalities from air bags in 1994, eight in 1995, twenty-four in 1996, and twenty-nine in 1997. Neal R. Feigenson and Daniel S. Bailis, Air Bag Safety: Media Coverage, Popular Conceptions, and Public Policy, 7 Psychol. Pub. Pol'y and L. 444, 459-60 (2001) (citing statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [herein after NHTSA] reports of air bag deployment leading to death or serious injury). 15. Although Diana was the first child to die from an air bag deployment, her lawsuit was not the first lawsuit involving a child air bag fatality to go to trial. The first case resulted in a jury verdict for the plaintiff of $750,000 that was later vacated due to insufficiency of the evidence regarding design defect. See Crespo v. Chrysler Corp., 75 F. Supp. 2d 225 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). 16.

With respect to the time of deployment, the ex perts averred that it is not technically feasible, given the many variables of any accident, to provide a speed at which air bags must or must not deploy. Rather, all air bag systems have an upper threshold at which they must deploy ("must fire") and a lower threshold at which they must not deploy ("no fire"). Between these thresholds is a "may fire" range that, depending on the numerous variables involved in the crash, may or may not result in a deployment. The "may fire" range is, in essence, a "safety zone" to ensure the air bag will deploy at the "must fire" threshold and not at the "no fire" threshold.18 Experts for Volvo explained that air bags were originally designed in the 1960s to meet the growing needs of automobile safety given the rising fatalities on our highways.19 Thirty years later, Volvo equipped its Volvo 850 GLT with driver and passenger side air bags before other manufac turers and five years before the federal government even required air bags at all. The experts claimed that, at the time of trial in 1999, there were nearly fifty million cars on the road with air bags and that 250,000 of those were the Volvo 850 GLT. Volvo engineers further testified that since Volvo first installed its air bags into an automobile in 1993, no child or any person had ever been killed by the system until Diana Zhang. In fact, they con tended that in the two million accidents that involved air bag deployments, only ninety adults had been killed. In those situations, moreover, many persons had not been seat belted as mandated by law. Volvo experts ex plained that, in the year preceding the trial, air bag field experience showed that air bag systems saved 3,000 lives. More specifically, evidence was pre sented that air bags benefit both children and adults by providing additional protection in accidents involving speeds at less than ten miles per hour. 17. Experts testified that sixty milliseconds from the time of deceleration of the vehicle, the air bag is completely inflated and the occupant is moving forward into the bag. In order to ensure the air bag is inflated in time to prevent a second collision inside the vehicle, the typical estimated rate of deployment is between 160 to 170 miles per hour. The time required to blink an eye is 200 milliseconds, which is less than one-quarter of one second. Air bags can be fully inflated and then deflated between 175-190 milliseconds. See also L.K. Sullivan and J.M. Kossar, Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Comm'n, Air Bag Deployment Char acteristics - Final Report, U.S. Dep't of Transp. Rpt No: DOT-HS-807 869, VRTC 87-0074 (1992) (available from the Nat'l Info. Technical Serv., www.ntis.gov) (comparing the peak and average deployment velocities of different types of air bag systems). 18. The threshold speeds are measured by the change in velocity of the vehicle (otherwise known as Delta-V). The precise speeds for the three thresholds are considered proprietary by most automobile manufacturers. 19. See generally Joseph M. Callahan, Air Bags Revisited, Auto. Indus., Feb. 1984, at 6; John D. Graham, Auto Safety: Assessing America's Performance 30, 37-39 (1989).</page><page sequence="6">968 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) Consequently, Volvo experts opined that the benefits of the air bag system clearly outweighed the risks. Based on the foregoing evidence, defense counsel argued that Volvo's air bag system satisfied the risk-benefit test and was not defective. Attor neys for Volvo maintained that consumers should want and expect an air bag to deploy in an accident. When used correctly, an air bag system will save lives or prevent additional injuries in an overwhelming majority of accidents. They additionally argued that if Diana's mother had complied with the multiple safety instructions and warnings, her daughter would have lived to see her seventh birthday. Volvo's counsel concluded that Di ana Zhang was not killed because Volvo's air bag system was defective in design. Rather, defendant contended that she was killed because she was not wearing her seat belt. C. Jury Instructions Before the jury was allowed to determine whether Volvo should be re sponsible for Diana's death, the federal district court was required to decide what test or tests should be given to the jury to determine whether the air bag system was defective. 1. Ohio Product Liability Law: Design Defect Like other states,20 Ohio's Products Liability Act codified the common law and set forth the exclusive methods by which a manufacturer can be held stricdy liable in tort.21 Section 2307.75 of the Ohio Revised Code, in par 20. In the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Prods., Inc., 377 P.2d 897 (Cal. 1963), the California Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of strict liability in tort as a basis for product liability actions. Most states have now adopted this doctrine. See John F. Vargo, The Emperors New Clothes: The American Law Institute Adorns a uNew Cloth" for Section 402A Products Liability Design Defects?A Survey of States Reveals a Different Weave, 26 U. Mem. L. Rev. 493, 538 (1996) (noting that four states have never adopted strict liability in products cases); Cheeseman, supra note 1, at 160. 21. See generally Ohio Rev. Code ?? 2307.71-2307.80 (Baldwin 2001). Ohio enacted its Product Liability Act in 1988. See Werber, supra note 1, at 381. The most widely recognized articulation of the doctrine of strict liability is found in section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides: (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold. (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any con tractual relation with the seller ...</page><page sequence="7">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 969 ticular, establishes the requisite elements for proof of a design defect. As with most other jurisdictions,22 the statute provides for the availability of either or both of two tests: the consumer expectations test and the risk benefit test.23 A product is defective in design if: (1) When it left: the control of the manufacturer, the foreseeable risks asso ciated with its design ... exceeded the benefits associated with that design, ... or (2) It is more dangerous than an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.24 Notwithstanding the language of this statutory provision, Ohio follows the majority view that "does not require a mechanical instruction on all alternative tests in all product liability cases."25 Indeed&gt; a "trial court may instruct the jury using the risk benefit theory, consumer expectation theory, or both."26 Significandy, the court has discretion to choose the appropriate test given the facts and circumstances of each case.27 Therefore, the court in Hisrich was faced with two choices. It could instruct the jury on both the consumer expectation test and the risk-benefit test. Alternatively, the court could reject the consumer expectations test and instruct the jury to engage only in a risk-benefit analysis. a. Risk-Benefit Test The risk-benefit test asks whether "on balance the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design."28 In Ohio, the statute provides a nonexclusive list of factors to consider when determining whether a product is unreasonably danger ous and defective.29 Dean Wade first set forth these factors in his seminal 22. For a detailed listing of those states that have adopted strict liability by statute, see Vargo, supra note 17, at 559. 23. The Supreme Court of Ohio had previously adopted the consumer expectations test in 1977 and the risk-benefit test in 1982. See Knitz v. Minster Mach. Co., 432 N.E.2d 814 (Ohio 1982) (risk-benefit test); Temple v. Wean United, Inc., 364 N.E.2d 267 (Ohio 1977) (consumer expectations test). See also Werber, supra note 1, at 386. In a comprehensive re search article, John Vargo has deduced that thirty-two states employ some form of risk-utility test and twenty-five states employ some variation of the consumer expectations test. See Vargo, supra note 17, at 550-556. Given various interpretations and applications of the two tests over the years, Mr. Vargo concludes that "the common law courts have used at least six or seven, if not more, tests for strict liability design defect."

Dean Wade defines consumer expectations as follows: "the user's anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product and their avoidability due to the general public knowl edge of the obvious condition of the product or the existence of suitable warnings or instruc tions." See Wade, supra note 27, at 837.

See Vargo, supra note 17, at 541; see also Ellen Werth eimer, Unknowable Dangers and the Death of Strict Liability: The Empire Strikes Back, 60 U. On. L. Rev. 1183 (1992). Five states consider the risk-utility factors only without imputing any knowledge of the product's danger to the defendant. See Vargo, supra note 17, at 545-46. 35.

However, the Ohio Strict Liability Act abolishes the approach of former cases that allowed the determination of defect to be made with the benefit of hindsight. See Ohio Rev. Code ?? 2307.71-2307.80 (Baldwin 2001).

Consumer Expectations Test Contrary to the risk-benefit test, which assesses the product defect from a manufacturer's viewpoint, the consumer expectations standard considers the consumer viewpoint.37 In order to sat isfy the consumer expectation test, the defect must be within the realm of common consumer knowledge.38 The "average consumer must have fairly definite expectations" about the product.39 More specifically, the focus of the consumer expectations test is on the ordinary consumer who uses the product with the ordinary knowledge of its characteristics common to the community.40 Thus, the mere occurrence of an accident does not satisfy the consumer expectations test.41 Further more, in addition to being an objective inquiry, the consumer's expectations regarding a product must be reasonable.42 In contrast to the express bal ancing found in the risk-benefit test,43 implicit in consumer expectancy is a negligence calculus.44 As such, a jury generally is not provided with spe 36. See, e.g., Jack Berman, Beshada v. Johns-Manville Products Corp.: The Function of State of the Art Evidence in Stria Products Liability, 10 Am. J.L. and Med. 93, 98 (1984). 37. See Vargo, supra note 17, at 507 (discussing "proconsumer" view of ? 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts). 38. See Pruitt v. Gen. Motors Corp., 599 N.E.2d 723 (Ohio Ct. App. 1991). 39. 63 Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability ? 564 (1997). As will be discussed later in this article, courts do not uniformly agree whether the plaintiff's actual knowledge of the danger of the product will provide sufficient evidence, or is even relevant to, reasonable consumer expec tations. Many states, however, allow evidence of the plaintiff's subjective knowledge of the product's safety. Thus, if the plaintiff has more knowledge than an ordinary consumer, he or she will be held to that higher standard. See id. ? 585. 40. See id. 41. See State Farm v. Chrysler Corp., 523 N.E.2d 489,494-95 (Ohio 1988). Strict liability in products is not tantamount to absolute liability because the objective of tort law is not to make the producer the insurer of all product-related injuries. See Van Flein, supra note 30, at 4 ("The term 'strict' should generally be avoided as a modifier of the term 'products liability' ... it creates a false aura of absolute liability where none exists.") If that were that case, "compensation would be divorced from causality and tort liability would serve as a large scale social insurance program." Viscusi, supra note 27, at 585. 42. See Knitz v. Minster Mach. Co., 432 N.E.2d 814 (Ohio 1982); Simpkins v. Starkey, No. C-860274, 1987 WL 8420 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 25, 1987). Ten states, however, do not look to what the "reasonable" consumer believed about the product. Instead, these states consider the beliefs of the "ordinary" consumer. See Vargo, supra note 17, at 538-40. 43. The risk-benefit test is an express balancing test modeled after a well-known negligence formula. See Werber, supra note 1, at 387. 44. See id. Although it may appear that negligence and strict liability are different, strict liability is actually infused with negligence concepts. See Vernon Palmer, A General Theory of the Inner Structure of Strict Liability: Common Law, Civil Law, and Comparative Law, 62 Tvl. L. Rev. 1303, 1354-55 (1988); Berman, supra note 33, at 95 ("foreseeability requirement in negligence forms scope and content of strict liability"); see also Wayne M. Serra, Ensuring the Safety of Genotech Drugs Through Implied Warranty Theory, 23 Am. J.L. and Med. 363, 376 (1997) (theories of negligence, strict liability, and implied warranty "overlap"). Under either the risk-benefit or consumer expectations formula of products liability knowledge is imputed</page><page sequence="10">972 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) cific factors in order to consider the issue of defect.45 Rather, jurors are simply instructed to find the product defective if it is "dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary con sumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the com munity as to its characteristics."46 The consumer expectation concept existed prior to the risk-benefit test. It was originally developed in consumer warranty cases and only later adopted as part of the law of strict products liability.47 As a consequence, the consumer expectation standard has been traditionally applied only in strict liability cases involving consumer products.48 In limited circum stances, however, the standard has been applied in cases involving non consumer products. These situations include accidents occurring in res ipsa-like situations.49 Consumers have also been found to have expecta tions about industrial products where the instructions or advertising to someone and then negligence is applied.

American Motors Corp., for example, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that there was sufficient evidence that the roll bar of a jeep displaced during a pitch-over accident on off-road terrain was more dan gerous than the expectations of an ordinary consumer.51 The court found that reasonable consumer expectations could be derived from the com mercial advertising of the vehicle manufacturer. The court declared: "The commercial advertising of a product will be the guiding force upon the expectations of consumers with regard to the safety of a product, and is highly relevant to a formulation of what those expectations might be."52 Because the manufacturer's advertising challenged potential customers to enjoy the off-road terrain and stressed the vehicle's ability to drive up and down steep hills involving the greatest risk of pitch-overs as occurred in the case, the court concluded that the vehicle had failed to satisfy the expectations it had created.53 Other than the few cases delineated above, courts in Ohio and elsewhere have consistendy refused to apply the consumer expectation standard in design defect cases involving industrial or otherwise nonconsumer prod ucts.54 Courts reason that "the consumer would not know what to expect, not knowing how safe the product could be made."55 The above deficiency is simply because ordinary consumers do not pos sess sufficient knowledge on the technical and scientific aspects of certain design defect claims to even form an expectation regarding the scientific functioning of the product.56 As explained by the Ohio Supreme Court in Knitz v. Minster Machine Co., "[difficulty could arise, for example, where the injured party ... is ignorant of the product and has no expectation of its safety, or where a new product is involved and no expectation of safety 50.

[T]here are situations in which the consumer would not know what to expect, because he would have no idea how safe the product could be made.58 In addition to the repeated rejection of the test in a majority of courts throughout America, a great number of scholars have sharply criticized the consumer expectations test over the years as a measure of design defect.59 The American Law Institute has also removed the consumer expectations standard from its formulation of design defect in the most recent Restatement.60 2.

Air bags are highly publicized and are commonplace products. They are heavily marketed for safety and consum ers pay extra to have them in their vehicles. Consequendy, consumers can reasonably expect that an air bag will not kill them in a minor accident. In support of her argument, the plaintiff cited to Bresnahan v. Chrysler Corp.62 and Ambrose v. Chrysler Corp.61 Both cases allowed the jury to assess the alleged defectiveness of air bags in minor collisions based on consumer expectations of their safety.64 The plaintiff further pointed out that Volvo's argument that it complied with federal law is irrelevant given that any issue as to federal preemption had been rejected. Indeed, courts have consis tendy held that compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a party from liability under common law.65 3. Defendant's Position: Risk-Benefit Test66 Volvo asserted that the risk-benefit test should be the only standard by which Volvo's air bag system is measured. Volvo maintained that the courts in Pruitt v. General Motors Corp.67 Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota62, and Wheeler v. Chrysler Corp.69 rejected the consumer expectation test in a products liability claim alleging the defective design of an air bag system.70 The most recent case of Pruitt71 dealt with an alleged defect in the air bag system of a vehicle that had deployed during a low speed collision.

Chrysler Corp.12 on that same issue The court explained its ruling as follows: The deployment of an air bag is, quite fortunately, not part of the "everyday experience" of the consuming public. Minimum safety standards for air bags are not within the common knowledge of lay jurors. Jurors are in need of expert testimony to evaluate the risk and benefits of the challenged design. Even Pruitt's own expert testified that in designing air bags there are tradeoffs involving complex technical issues. Therefore, the appellate court held that the trial court correcdy refused to give the consumer expectations instruc tion.73 The federal district court in Collazo-Santiago addressed the identical is sue. The plaintiff sued Toyota Motor Corp. alleging that the air bag system in plaintiff's vehicle was defectively designed under the consumer expec tation test. The court determined, however, that the consumer expectation theory was not applicable to the issue of whether the vehicle's air bag was defectively designed. It held: In the case at hand, even assuming that the airbags caused the plaintiff's in juries, it is highly unlikely that an ordinary consumer would know what technical considerations influenced the design of the airbag system in TMC cars, nor have any specific expectations as to how safe airbags should be. Instructing the jury on the consumer expectations test would therefore impermissibly permit the jury to find liability on little more than intuition or whim. Accordingly, the jury shall not be given instructions based on [the consumer expectations test].74 The court in Wheeler v. Chrysler Corp.15 reached the same conclusion and rejected the consumer expectation standard to test an air bag system. The district court explained that "the ordinary consumer has no basis upon which to form reasonable expectations of the technical considerations and trade-offs inherent in the design of an air bag's deployment system."76 Volvo maintained that Pruitt, Santiago, and Wheeler should be found persuasive in its case. The plaintiff had alleged two design defects in the air bag system of the 1993 Volvo 850 GET. These defects concerned the time of deployment and the rate of deployment of the air bag.

As to the rate of deployment, the plaintiff's experts opined that the speed of deployment is too "aggressive." Volvo asserted that the ordinary consumer would have no expectation regarding the threshold change in velocity for air bag deployment or the aggressivity of an air bag deployment.77 Air bags are complex technical devices that are required to perform a difficult task under literally an in finite number of circumstances.78 Moreover, the performance parameters of any air bag system are dictated by both federal law and the laws of physics.79 Volvo additionally emphasized to the court that the air bag system in stalled in the 1993 Volvo 850 GLT was required to meet certain minimum performance requirements pursuant to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan dard 208.80 FMVSS 208 requires that a passenger car such as the 1993 Volvo 850 GLT meet certain specific "injury criteria" for head, chest, and compressive load to the femurs when the vehicle is impacted at thirty miles per hour head on into an immovable barrier.81 The injury criteria are mea sured in reference to an anthropomorphic test dummy known as the fiftieth 77. Although manufacturers presently use several different technologies in their air bag systems, these systems usually function through the use of crash sensors installed in the front bumper and/or passenger compartment, diagnostic instruments that indicate readiness, and a unit consisting of an inflator and the air bag itself. See Cynthia M. Certo, 1993 Changes to Safety Standard 208: Deploying An (Air) Bag Full of Products Liability Claims?, 67 Temp. L. Rev. 673 (1994), citing Don Sherman, It's in the Bag, Popular Sci., Oct. 1992, at 58-60. When a vehicle sustains a frontal impact of sufficient force, an electrical signal triggers an initiator. The initiator ignites the sodium azide propellant. The propellant generates nitrogen gas that inflates the air bag. See id. 78.

See Brief of Appellee at 48-49, citing to, inter alia, various portions of the trial tran script and appellate record. Although federal law requires manufacturers to meet minimum performance standards, such safety standards do not prescribe the speed at which air bags should deploy, nor the design, placement, or engineering involved in the air bag system. See 49 U.S.C. ? 30102(a)(9); Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, Occupant Crash Protec tion, 49 C.F.R. ?? 571 and 585 (1994).

In accordance with the specifications set forth by 49 C.F.R. ?? 572.5-572.11, that test dummy is approximately 5T0" tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds.82 Finally, FMVSS 208 requires that an air bag system provide the requisite occupant protection to an unbelted occupant.83 The existence of these specific requirements severely limits the basic design options for air bag systems, particularly with regard to the rate of deployment and time of deployment.84 Indeed, in order to meet the performance criteria set forth in FMVSS 208, certain immutable laws of physics apply.85 The deployment of the front driver and passenger side air bags on the 1993 Volvo 850 GLT are governed by the "Delta-V," or change in velocity of the vehicle.86 Volvo argued that no reasonable and ordinary consumer would understand even what Delta-V is, and certainly would not understand the difference be tween minimum deployment thresholds and physics.87 Volvo concluded that the alleged defects involved such highly technical, scientific, and engineering principles that no ordinary consumer could have any reasonable expectation as to the actual performance of the air bag system.88 No consumer would reasonably understand the interplay between the vehicle's change in velocity, the vehicle's coefficient of restitution, the kinematics of the vehicle's occupants during a crash and the effect such factors have on the "minimum deployment threshold settings" of the sub ject vehicle.89 Furthermore, Volvo asserted that no ordinary consumer would have any knowledge or expectation on the number of milliseconds it takes to deploy an air bag or the amount of force exerted by the discharge of nitrogen gas into the air bag.90 No consumer could have an expectation regarding the "5/30 rule" of deployment.91 Quite simply, the reasonable ordinary consumer knows that air bags sometimes deploy in accidents but does not know the precise functioning and specifications in such situations.92 If the ordinary consumer did have 82.

Trial Court Decision and Appeal After carefully considering the positions of the parties, in addition to pre cedent and policy, the federal district court removed the consumer expec tations test from the jury and instructed only under the risk-benefit test.99 In analyzing Volvo's air bag system under that standard, the jury returned with a unanimous defense verdict.100 Notably, the district court received no direction from the Supreme Court of Ohio or any intermediate appellate court in Ohio. In fact, no state supreme court in the nation had addressed whether the consumer expec tations standard is applicable to air bag design defect claims.101 Many fed 93. Id. at 51. 94. See id. 95.

On appeal, however, the trial court's decision to reject the consumer expectations test was reversed.108 The court of appeals was particularly per suaded by the fact that Volvo knew it was possible that an air bag system could kill a child riding in the front passenger seat and yet did not specify "death" in its warnings and instructions on air bag safety.109 Relying on ment.

DISCUSSION For the air bag manufacturer, the ramifications of an assessment based on consumer expectations could be significant. A. Risk of "Reasonable" Expectations The risk-benefit test is theoretically, and actually, an objective test. It re quires an explicit analysis of various criteria with consumer expectations being one criterion.112 In contrast, while theoretically objective by requir ing a "reasonableness" inquiry,113 the consumer expectations test is actually subjective.114 To be sure, no juror is going to think his or her beliefs re garding air bag performance is unreasonable.115 Like Diana's mother in Hisrich, possibly some (or all) of the jurors would not expect an air bag to even deploy in a low speed accident. A consumer expectations standard of assessing air bag performance is passengers of the danger of placing a child in the front passenger seat of the vehicle that was equipped with an air bag.

See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11 (bias in media coverage influences or reinforces popular perceptions, thus shaping public policy and private litigation.). The study was limited to the amount of money awarded because of an alleged air bag defect in a products liability action, as opposed to whether or not any money would be awarded at all. However, it is reasonable to assume that the same misinformation would make it more likely for a jury to find an air bag manufacturer liable as well. Furthermore, design standards based on consumer viewpoints do not encourage manufacturers to build safer air bag systems. While consumer expectations may result in more and larger verdicts, jury results would not "influence cor porate decision making at the design stage." Certo, supra note 75, at 697 (advocating that compliance with federal standards should be dispositive of air bag design liability). Design standards would fluctuate from case to case and inconsistent decisions would not provide guidance to manufacturers as to the safest air bag design. Obviously, air bags "cannot be redesigned from accident to accident." Michael Hoenig, Resolution of "Crashwortbiness" Design Claims, 55 St. John's L. Rev. 633, 639 (1981). 117. As of 1999, nearly four million driver and passenger-side air bags have inflated and saved an estimated 3,915 lives while causing 127 deaths in low-speed crashes. See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, citing statistics from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 1999 and NHTSA, 1997. Overall, the NHTSA data on air bag risks and benefits indicates that they reduce the risk of fatality to drivers and passengers by 11 percent. See id. at 481, n.l (detailing how NHTSA calculates air bag risks and benefits). For children riding in the front seat in frontal collisions, however, passenger side air bags increase the risk of death. See id. at 445 (citations omitted). In collisions below eighteen miles per hour, moreover, the risk of minor injury outweighed the benefits for women. See 19 Andrews Auto. Litig. Rep. 24, at 4 (Oct. 2000), citing Maria Segui-Gomez, Driver Air Bag Effectiveness by Severity of the Crash, Am. J. Pub. Health, Oct. 1, 2000. 118. See generally Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11. This article explains that air bags were once considered by the public to be a panacea but are now seen as potential killers. In particular, in November 1994, the public incorrecdy believed that air bags provide more safety than seat belts and that they could not cause serious injury when they inflate. By December 1996, however, the vast majority of consumers knew that a passenger-side air bag makes riding in the front seat more dangerous to children under age twelve. 119. The Feigenson and Bailis article studied print media only. See id. at 476. Notwith standing this restriction, the article concluded that the patterns of simplification of quanti tative data and reliance on unrepresentative exemplars observed in print media coverage would be prevalent on radio, television, and the Internet, and the effects on air bag-related judgments at least as pronounced. . 120. See id. at 460. 121. Most articles fail to provide both the risks and the benefits of air bags, nor are there an equal number of articles published on both the risks and the benefits of air bags. 122. See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, at 446-48 ("media tend to dramatize safety</page><page sequence="21">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 983 deployments list very few quantitative statistics and fail to provide any relative risk statistics at all for consumers to make an informed judgment.123 Accounts of accidents involving air bags also fail to mention important information such as the exact speed of the vehicle, the nature of the injuries, and whether or not the person was wearing a seat belt.124 Thus, not only does the media "overemphasize instances of air bag fatalities relative to accidents in which air bags save drivers or passengers from death or serious injury," it also "underemphasizes the proportion of infant and child victims who were not properly seated at the time of their fatal accidents."125 As a result, "the dominant message the print media convey is that air bags kill, and more pointedly, that air bags kill kids."126 Consequently, the NHTSA is concerned that air bags, which fatally injure children in low speed collisions, place the concept of air bags at risk in terms of consumer acceptability despite the overall net safety bene fits.127 Moreover, the negative consumer expectations about air bag per formance and safety created by biased media coverage have caused increasingly large jury verdicts and awards.128 Because erroneous risk per risk management 'as [a] struggle between the forces of good and evil or between wisdom and stupidity,") (citations omitted). 123. See id. at 47 5(citations omitted). Feigenson and Bailis explained: Barely a sixth of our sample of articles presented both air bag risk and benefit data, and no article offered readers the sort of relative risk information (e.g., the likelihood of an adverse air bag event per miles driven or per trip, or as compared to the likelihood of other adverse health or safety events) that risk communication experts believe laypeople can best under stand. Providing such information would take up very little space and could well reduce the sorts of judgmental errors (e.g., overestimation of air bag fatalities) we found in the risk perception experiment. Id. at 475 (internal citations omitted). 124. Air bags increase the risk of moderate chest injury for unbelted drivers and the risk of serious upper extremity injury for unbelted and belted drivers. Id. at 445, citing to 1996 NHTSA information. 125. See id. at 460. 126. See id. at 461. Although air bags cause nonfatal injuries in about 43 percent of de ployments, 96 percent of these injuries are minor scrapes and bruises. See id. at 445 (citation omitted). 127. See id. at 481, n.3, citing NHTSA, 1997a. 128. A study of 151 persons was conducted (43 men, 105 women, and three declined to state their gender) to test whether mock juror awards are sensitive to media context. See id. at 463. Persons who read biased narratives or received base rate information gave significandy more money to the victim of an air bag accident than those who read neutral stories and/or received neutral information. See id. at 467-73 ("People exposed to biased base rate infor mation tend to believe that air bags pose a more serious social problem than do those exposed to neutral base rate information and they treat the victim of this more objectionable conduct as deserving of a larger award."). One such example was a story by Car and Driver in which an "expert" stated that if air bags saved 2,620 lives and killed eighty-seven (the statistics as of 1997), then eighty-seven persons divided by 2,620 is 3.3 percent and the Food and Drug Administration certainly would not allow a drug to be marketed with a 3 percent fatality rate. See id. at 481, n.14. Hence, the expert framed the issue as a 3 percent chance of dying as opposed to the percentage chance of lives saved. See id. It is important to remember that air</page><page sequence="22">984 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) ceptions have been proven to detrimentally affect the liability of air bag manufacturers, the negatively skewed public attitudes resulting from sen sationalized journalism of accidents involving air bags should be consid ered in determining whether to test defect claims based on "reasonable" consumer expectations.129 B. Absence of Expert Testimony In addition to the risk of unfair prejudice based on jurors' naturally using their own subjective and possibly erroneous expectations of air bag safety, the plaintiff's testimony on his or her own expectations may be admissible. The plaintiff's expectations of the air bag's performance may also provide, ipso facto, sufficient evidence to support the design defect claim.130 As a result, the plaintiff could arguably present a design defect claim without any expert testimony on the element of "defect."131 As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals declared in Hisrich v. Volvo, "the determination of whether a product is more dangerous than an ordinary person would expect is generally a question of fact which does not require expert testi bags do not kill 3 percent of the persons who ride in cars, nor do they kill in 3 percent of deployments. See id., citing NHTSA, 1997. 129. See id. at 462. 130. But see Jordan v. Paccar, Inc., 37 F.3d 1181, 1185 (6th Cir. 1994) (applying Ohio law) (no evidence to support the notion that an ordinary American consumer who purchases an American made truck would expect that it will exceed the impact-resistance capabilities of all other trucks in the United States and will instead meet the specification of some European manufacturers); Simpkins v. Starkey, No. C-860274, 1987 WL 8420 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 25, 1987) (plaintiff's personal testimony could not establish consumer expectation standard be cause the vehicle manual only said that seat belts lessened injuries and did not prevent them); Kitchens v. McKay, 528 N.E.2d 603 (Ohio Ct. App. 1987). See also Werber, supra note 1, at 399. 131. Appellees' Petition for Rehearing En Banc at 2 filed on appeal in Hisrich. Neverthe less, in a crashworthiness case, the proof of "causation" must generally be by expert testimony. See Harvey v. Gen. Motors Corp., 873 F.2d 1343, 1349 (10th Cir. 1989) (applying Wyoming law); Curtis v. Gen. Motors Corp., 649 F.2d 808, 812-13 (10th Cir. 1981) (applying Colorado law); see also Werber, supra note 1, at 434. Courts have taken two views on the subject of what causation elements a plaintiff is required to prove to successfully state a product liability claim. Jurisdictions that employ the more liberal view have ruled that a plaintiff need only show the fact of enhancement; that is, that the injuries sustained were more severe as a result of a safety defect in the vehicle. See Mitchell v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., 669 F.2d 1199 (8th Cir. 1982) (applyingMinnesota law); Shipp v. Gen. Motors, 750 E2d 418 (5th Cir. 1985) (applyingTexas law). As such, the burden is placed on the defendant to apportion those injuries that are attributable to the accident and those that are attributable to the alleged defect. The opposing approach shifts the burden of apportionment to the second tortfeasor. The seminal case espousing this view is Huddell v. Levin, 537 F.2d 726 (3d Cir. 1976) (applying New Jersey law). See also Habecker v. Clark Equip. Co., 36 F.3d 278 (3d Cir. 1994) (applying Pennsylvania law); Stonehocker v. Gen. Motors Corp., 587 F.2d 151, 158 (4th Cir. 1978) (applying South Carolina law). Regardless of the approach taken, courts generally require plaintiff to establish these elements via expert testimony. See 63A Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability ?? 1026 and 1028 (1997); see generally Pearson, supra note 1; see, e.g., Caiazzo v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., 647 F.2d 241 (2d Cir. 1981) (applying New York law).</page><page sequence="23">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 985 mony."132 It has been held that unsafe unexpected performance based on consumer expectations is sufficient to infer defect.133 Nevertheless, this rule should be applied only in those situations where the air bag deployed while stopped at a traffic light or when there are claims of other obvious defects in the manufacturing (and not the design) of the air bag system. If no expert testimony is provided to discuss consumer awareness at the time of the accident and its accuracy as to air bag perfor mance, jurors are left with their own subjective expectations of the product at the time of trial. Reliance on whim and caprice, rather than sound science, contradicts not only state products liability law and evidentiary rules, but also under mines the pronouncement of the U.S. Supreme Court in Daubert and its progeny.134 That is precisely why the consumer expectations standard is not used when consumer attitudes are "distorted or difficult to gauge."135 Courts are in agreement that there are situations where the consumer "would not know what to expect, because he would have no idea how safe the product could be made."136 In those situations, the risk-benefit test is used exclusively to measure product performance. Accordingly, the fact that the consumer expectations test dispenses with any need for expert testimony at all should be considered when determin ing the appropriate standard for air bag performance.137 The lack of expert testimony compounds the risk of subjectivity in measuring air bag safety, resulting in a potentially erroneous and unfair result. 132.

Of course, the defendant manufacturer can present expert testimony on the consumer expectations test by providing what consumers knew about air bags at a particular point in time. Moreover, to the extent the plaintiff would provide expert testimony as to air bag design, one commentator suggests that it would be all too easy for that expert to testify that a par ticular safety feature could have been made better or safer for a specific accident. Certo, supra note 75, at 697. As a result, the plaintiff would not bear an insurmountable evidentiary burden.

Socially Valuable Product Along with the deleterious consequences articulated above, the high social utility of an air bag system should be considered in selecting the appro priate test by which to measure its performance and safety. Defining "defect" under any version of strict products liability has always been a controversial and difficult task.138 Most jurisdictions rely on a limited number of formulations of which design defect is only one example.139 Despite these differences in assessing product defect, the law has re peatedly recognized that manufacturers should not be liable for certain hazards that are unavoidable or socially acceptable.140 Courts uniformly exempt products of very high utility, such as prescription drugs, from strict liability in view of the compelling social interest in promoting the devel opment of such products.141 These principles have been incorporated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which has been called "the most widely accepted distillation of the common law of torts."142 Comment k to section 402A dictates that no liability be imposed on drug manufacturers "merely because [they have] undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk."143 In the 138.

Negligence concepts gained popularity with judges in the United States in the nineteenth century and actually replaced strict liability in order to protect infant industries.

Furthermore, even under the less stringent require ments of establishing design liability for general product defect claims,146 a court could apply an even more lenient standard if the product's design renders its social utility high in relation to its potential to cause harm.147 As such, even within the doctrine of strict products liability, certain prod ucts are considered more valuable than others and receive greater protec tion under products liability law.148 Consequendy, in determining whether the consumer expectations stan expectations test that determines whether the prescription drug meets the reasonable expec tations of the ordinary physician). 144.

See Owen, supra note 136, at 746; Trompeter, supra note 57, at 1150 (discussing the controversy created by the new Restatement because the new standards for product defect are much stricter than in the former Restatement).

Given that it is not yet possible to design an air bag system to adjust to a particular occupant height and weight or to predict and adjust in infinite kinds of collisions,157 manufacturers have urged consumers to "buckle 149.

See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, citing data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the NHTSA. 152. Overall, NHTSA data on air bag risks and benefits indicate that they reduce the risk of fatality to drivers and passengers by 11 percent. See id. at 481, n.l (detailing how the NHTSA calculates air bag risks and benefits). 153. Data covering years 1993-96 show that air bags deployed in 22 percent of the frontal crashes, reducing the risk of dying by 42 percent. See 19 Andrews Auto. Litig. Rep. 24, at 4 (Oct. 2000), citing Maria Segui-Gomez, Driver Air Bag Effectiveness by Severity of the Crash, Am. j. Pub. Health, Oct. 1, 2000. 154. Unbelted drivers have an increased risk of upper chest injury with an air bag. See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, citing NHTSA 1997 data. 155. In low speed collisions, however, air bag systems have disproportionately protected men as opposed to women. In less severe accidents, moreover, the risk of minor injury out weighed the benefits for women. Air bags were protective to men at crashes above 3.2 miles per hour and for women above 17.5 miles per hour. See 19 Andrews Auto. Litig. Rep. 24, at 4 (Oct. 2000), citing Segui-Gomez, supra note 151. As of October 15, 1997, air bags had killed fourteen women less than sixty-two inches tall, who would have survived but for the air bag deployment. See Air Bags: Parents' Group Opposes Amendment to End Required Protection of Unbelted Occupants, 25 Prod. Safety and Liab. Rep. (BNA) 1008 (Oct. 24, 1997). 156. For children like Diana Zhang riding in the front seat in frontal collisions, passenger side air bags increase the risk of death by one-third and 21 percent in all crashes. See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, at 445. By 1997, air bags had killed forty-seven children in accidents. See Parents' Group Opposes Amendment, supra note 153. In response, some states have enacted laws to limit the risks of air bags to children. See Minimum Wage, Car Seats Among 948 New Laws in '02, Fresno Bee, Dec. 29, 2001 (announcing new California law raising the age and weight limit for safety seats from age four and forty pounds to age six and sixty pounds). 157. Apparendy, some German automobile manufacturers do now offer air bag designs that ascertain whether the occupant is wearing a seat belt. See Norton, supra note 61, at 689. In addition, advances in technology have allowed manufacturers to begin making and testing multistage air bag systems with different output levels depending on the severity of the crash.</page><page sequence="27">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 989 up."158 They have also warned consumers to never place their children in the front passenger seat of a vehicle containing an air bag.159 Some man ufacturers have also built special child-safety seats into the back seats of vehicles, like Volvo did as far back as 1993. As an additionally safety mea sure, consumers now have the ability to disconnect the air bag system in their vehicle.160 Thus, consumers have the ability to do what air bags, as yet, cannot adjust to the danger of an air bag system with a particular person or in a particular situation.161 NHSTA approved automatic on-off switches for air bags in 1995, two years after the fatal crash that took the life of Diana Zhang.162 Nearly four million air bags have deployed since they were originally designed to curtail the rising fatality statistics on our nation's highways.163 The development of the air bag safety system has been described as follows: Passive restraint systems [such as air bags] in motor vehicles were originally designed to meet a growing need for increased automobile safety precautions, Sensing systems have now improved to the point where multiple deployment thresholds are now possible. These new "smart" air bag systems will discern the buckle status, seat position, and type of occupant and adjust accordingly for greater safety. As discussed above, at the time of the collision in the Hisrich case, manufacturers were subject to FMVSS 208 requirements measured on a test dummy in a thirty miles per hour crash barrier test. See 58 Fed. Reg. 46,553 (Sept. 2, 1993) (codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 571 and 585). All air bag-equipped vehicles had to meet NHTSA criteria, regardless of whether the occupant was wearing a seat belt. See id. at 46, 562. Federal law changed in 1998 to allow the testing of air bags to be performed by impact simulator. For vehicles built after May 2000, federal standards require additional testing at new speeds with both belted and unbelted occupants. New crash test dummies are required for small women and children. Manufac turers are also under an obligation to develop technology so that air bag systems can discern both the size of the occupant and the seat position. 49 C.F.R. 571.? 208 (2002). 158. See discussion of warnings at note 183 and instructions provided by Volvo. Despite manufacture and NHTSA warnings, and despite the fact that seat belt installation has been mandatory in passenger cars since 1964, studies have shown that consumers fail to use them. 159. Although federal law did not require air bag warnings regarding danger to children until 1996, Volvo provided such warnings on the 1993 model year 950 GIT. See Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, Occupant Crash Protection, 61 Fed. Reg. 60,206 and 60,215-21 (Nov. 27, 1996) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 571). Cf. Ashley W. Warren, Compliance with Governmental Regulatory Standards: Is It Enough to Immunize a Defendant from Tort Liability?, 49 Baylor L. Rev. 763, 788-91 (1997) (detailing FDA duties regarding warn ings for pharmacological products). 160. See Air Bag On-Off Switches, 62 Fed. Reg. 62,406, 62,441-42 (Nov., 1997) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 571 and 595). One criterion in assessing product defect under the risk-benefit test is who?the manufacturer or the consumer?is better able to avoid the risk of injury. See W. Kip Viscusi, Wading Through the Muddle of Risk-Utility Analysis, 39 Am. U. L. Rev. 573, 581 (1990) ("reliance on the consumer to take precautions rather than altering the product"). 161. Apparendy, persistent misinformation about air bag safety has led to the incorrect use of these switches for children between the ages of one and twelve years old, but consumers do accurately utilize the switches for the safety of infants and adults. See Minimum Wage, Car Seats Among 948 New Laws in '02, Fresno Bee, Dec. 29, 2001. 162. On-off switches were only approved for vehicles with small or no back seats. See id. 163. See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11 (explaining that 3.3 million driver-side air bags and 600,000 passenger side air bags have been deployed as of 1999, about one deploy ment for every 250 vehicle years).</page><page sequence="28">990 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) that is, to diminish vehicular fatalities, prevent serious injury, and provide a means of added protection to the average safety-conscious consumer. As tech nology developed, various passive restraint systems emerged, intended to ben efit vehicle occupants without their active participation. Differing from active restraint systems [such as seat belts] which required overt action on the part of the vehicle occupant, passive restraint systems were thought to be the per fect protection for an otherwise absent-minded consumer who seemed less than anxious to "buckle up."164 Accordingly, although air bags have not been the "panacea" for highway safety, their benefits have been demonstrated to outweigh their risks to the general public.165 It bears repeating that the sole purpose of their devel opment was to prevent injury and death. Additionally, like medical products and pharmaceuticals, air bag systems are heavily regulated and tested pursuant to government standards for safety.166 Government oversight through the NHTSA ensures that a more lenient liability standard will not reduce the safety incentive for building a better air bag system.167 If an air bag safety system fails to meet federal 164.

Automobile safety systems were introduced to the general public under the "watchful eye" of Congress via the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. Condon, supra note 52, at 274; Certo, supra note 75, at 673-75 (discussing uniform federal scheme for auto design from 1966-1993), citing John D. Graham, Auto Safety: Assessing America's Performance 30, 50 (1989) (oudining history of NHTSA). The Act provided for the imple mentation of federal motor vehicle safety standards. These standards led to the mandatory installation of seat belts in 1967. See id.; see also 49 U.S.C. ?? 30101-30169 (1994); see generally Peter L. Kahn, Regulation and Simple Arithmetic: Shifting the Perspective on Tort Reform, 72 N.C. L. Rev. 1129, 1168 (1994). In 1974, these standards allowed manufacturers to provide either a belt system or a passive restraint system such as air bags or automatic seat belts. In 1989, passive restraint systems were required. See id.; 49 C.F.R. ? 571.208 (1992). In 1997 and 1998, the standards provided that the passive restraint system must be an inflatable re straint (in addition to seat belts). See id.; 49 C.F.R. ? 571.208 (1994); Standard No. 208, 58 Fed. Reg. 46,551 (Sept. 2, 1993) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 571 and 585). It is the duty of the NHTSA to make and administer these safety regulations. See Margaret Renee Herman, Are We Learning From The Mistakes of Environmentalists? The Application of Environmental Harmonization Models to the Automotive Industry, 16 Ariz. J. Int'l and Comp. L. 543, 563-65 (1999). The FDA, likewise, certifies the safety and efficacy of a drug or medical device. See, e.g., Toner v. Lederle Lab., 732 P.2d 297, 311 (Idaho 1987). The Reporters of the Third Restatement justify special treatment of drug and/or medical products because the regulatory system governing prescription drugs is a legitimate mechanism for setting the standards for drug design. Corboy, supra note 56, at 1099. Compliance with FDA rules and regulations designed for safety, like compliance with NHTSA, does not preclude the remedies of strict liability if a product later proves unsafe. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470 (1996); Walker v. Johnson and Johnson Vision Prods., Inc., 552 N.W.2d 679,685 (Mich. Ct. App. 1996); Connelly v. Iolab Corp., 927 S.W.2d 848, 851 (Mo. 1996). 167. See Van Flein, supra note 30, at 9-10 (providing policy considerations such as an incentive to build safer products, risk spreading to those most able to pay for injuries, and the removal of evidentiary barriers).</page><page sequence="29">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 991 standards, it is subject to recall. While the certification process is self regulating in that manufacturers provide the NHTSA with periodic test results demonstrating compliance with the safety standards, the NHTSA does conduct yearly compliance checks in order to ensure that a manufac turer's claims regarding safety are accurate.168 The NHTSA has the au thority to recall all vehicles that do not meet federal safety standards.169 The NHTSA has also been delegated the power to ascertain safety defects in products irrespective of compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In this regard, the agency tracks complaints, determines trends, and evaluates the effects of such defects.170 Therefore, considering the greater protection provided to manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceutical products, manufacturers of air bag safety systems should benefit from the exclusive use of the risk-utility anal ysis in determining air bag design.171 Of note, consumer expectations are still considered under the risk-benefit standard.172 Although "strict liability was never intended to make manufacturers insurers of their products,"173 168. See Herman, supra note 164, at 563-65. 169. See 15 U.S.C. ? 1400 (1993); see also Certo, supra note 75, at 697 (discussing the NHTSA's ability to recall as a "powerful tool" to promote safety). Manufacturers must re purchase nonconforming vehicles or furnish conforming parts at their own expense. Id. 170. Certo, supra note 75. Of course, another method of maximizing the goal of deterrence is for courts to apply clear legal theories that allow potential defendants to predict the im position of liability for the harm they cause. See Serra, supra note 41, at 376 (1997). Adopting a rule that precludes the consumer expectations test when testing design defect in an air bag system would yield such a result. 171. See Viscusi, supra note 27, at 579 (indicating that the risk utility test may be better than the consumer expectations standard in testing design defect because costs are consid ered). In fact, at least one scholar has criticized the risk-benefit test as suggesting an economic model and unreasonably expanding the notion of strict products liability. See generally id. One of the traditional purposes of strict liability was that the manufacturer was in a better position to assume the loss as compared with an ordinary consumer. See, e.g., Trompeter, supra note 57, at 1147 ("The rationale behind strict liability is that the manufacturer, in a better position than the consumer to assume loss associated with a defective product, should bear the re sponsibility for harm caused by the product."); W. Page Keeton, Product Liability and the Meaning of Defect, 5 St. Mary's L.J. 30 (1973); see also Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, 150 P.2d 436, 441 (Cal. 1944) ("The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business."). However, questions have been raised as to whether that is still the case. See James A. Henderson, Jr. and Aaron D. Twerski, Doctrinal Collapse in Products Liability: The Empty Shell of Failure to Warn, 65 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 265, 274 (1990). Consumers today not only have better access to insurance, but federal and private insurance coverage is much more extensive than when risk-spreading was first articulated as an objective during the emergence of the strict liability. See Viscusi, supra note 27, at 590 (asserting that tort law is no longer needed to fill the insurance gap, as consumers today often have multiple forms of recovery for the same accident). 172. See Restatement (Second) of Torts ? 402A (1965); Viscusi, supra note 27, at 580; see also Van Flein, supra note 30, at 4 (discussing the most recent Restatement promulgation as continuing to use "consumer expectations" as one factor in the risk-benefit test). 173. Berman, supra note 33, at 109; see also Zettle v. Handy Mfg. Co., 998 F.2d 358 (6th</page><page sequence="30">992 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) allowing air bag systems to be tested under design defect claims based on consumer expectations for air bags could have precisely this result.174 D. Relationship Between Design Defect and Inadequate Warning Claims An additional consideration in air bag product liability litigation is that of warnings. An inadequate warning claim is distinct from a design defect claim. If plaintiff's theory of liability is that inadequate and/or erroneous information given by the manufacturer in a warning or instruction caused the air bag system to be unreasonably dangerous, then the plaintiff should pursue an inadequate warning claim, not a design defect claim. Under this theory of products liability, the plaintiff asserts that the product could have been made safe, or at least safer, if adequate warnings or instructions had been provided.175 Commonly, counsel for the plaintiff in a products liability action will take the position at trial that the "evil" air bag or vehicle manufacturer has fooled the public into believing that air bags are a safety device.176 Even more outrageous is the outdated notion that manufacturers have an aver Cir. 1993) (applying Michigan law). To avoid treating manufacturers as an insurer of its products, most courts employ negligence concepts like those found in the risk-benefit test to limit the reach of strict liability. Berman, supra note 33, at 98. See generally Garey B. Spradley, Defensive Use of State of the Art Evidence in Strict Products Liability, 67 Minn. L. Rev. 343 (1982). 174. The continuing expansion of strict liability has provoked a liability crisis on the part of the manufacturer involving excessive costs and uninsurable risks. See Legis. Fiscal Office of the State of Louisiana, An Analyis of Tort Liability Exposure in the State Of Louisiana 6-7 (1985); see also Viscusi, supra note 27, at 588-89 (blaming the doctrine of strict liability for the bankruptcy of companies in the asbestos industry); see generally Kenneth Abraham, Distributing Risk: Insurance, Legal Theory, and Public Policy 44-100 (1986). As a result, entire industries have been eliminated. See id. In California, the legislature has enacted statutes of repose for asbestos and Dalkon Shield actions. See Cal. Civ. Code ?? 340.7 and 1431-1431.2 (West 1982 and Supp. 1996); but see Van Flein, supra note 30, at 10 (listing product removals such as artificial jaw implants and the Dalkon Shield device as success stories). For air bag manufacturers, in particular, it is important that design defect be analyzed as to an entire safety system and not just one vehicle. Contrary to claims of random manufacturing defects, the costs of all risks associated with an entire product line can poten tially be charged to the producer. See Viscusi, supra note 27, at 574. 175. See Leebron, supra note 136, at 415. 176. For the history of air bag development, see Callahan, supra note 16, at 6, and John D. Graham, Auto Safety: Assessing America's Performance 30, 50 (1989). Automobile man ufacturers initially resisted installing air bags in vehicles from 1968 to 1993 because air bags were considered "unreliable and dangerous." Id. at 212. Lee Iacocca, then-CEO of Chrysler Corp, declared in the early 1980s that even he was "not sure I'd want one of those gyzmos in my car." Lee Iacocca, Iacocca: An Autobiography 301 (1984). However, a decade later, he changed his mind. He explained his reasoning as follows: "I had my doubts about air bags, but today's new technology made me a believer." See id. The Chrysler Corp, in fact, became the first domestic manufacturer to offer air bag systems as standard equipment. See Certo, supra note 75, at 681. By this time, air bag technology had improved to a point where the public was suing manufacturers for the failure to install air bag safety systems into vehicles. Id. at 683-84.</page><page sequence="31">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 993 sion to new or improved safety measures because such a goal is incompat ible with profits.177 While these kinds of unsupportable assumptions have even found their way into scholarly works,178 the actual safety record of air bag systems demonstrates the fallacy of this kind of courtroom rhetoric.179 Furthermore, while there is no doubt that "safety" is good marketing, the incentive for increased revenues is one reason manufacturers strive to build better air bag safety systems. In any event, if a particular manufacturer has caused its air bag system to be a danger to consumers through its adver tising or other marketing information, it should be held accountable.180 However,, liability should be assessed under a defective warning theory and not one for defective design. IV. IMPLICATIONS To the extent courts would preclude the assessment of potential defects of air bag design based on consumer expectations, the window of opportunity for the manufacturer to be tested only under a risk-benefit analysis may be closing fast. Courts are clear that the consumer expectations test is not to be utilized where "a new product is involved and no expectation of safety has developed."181 Federal law did not require manufacturers to install air bag safety systems in their vehicles until 1997.182 As such, air bags became a standard feature in vehicles for the first time just a few years ago. 177. Although this may have been true when air bags were first created more than twenty years ago, it is not the case today. Compare Iacocca, supra note 174 (explaining that the auto industry made and marketed safety equipment but still "couldn't give the stuff away") and S. Rep. No. 1301 (1966), reprinted in 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2709, 2710 (discussing automotive industry conviction that "safety doesn't sell"), with Certo, supra note 75, at 673 ("consumers demand higher performance, better quality, and now, increased safety features such as air bag systems"). 178. See Norton, supra note 61, at 679-82, cited in the Brief of Appellant in Volvo v. Hisrich. The student in the foregoing article argues that manufacturers should be subject to erroneous consumer expectations for design defect liability to penalize them for marketing air bags as a safety feature. See Id. at 685-97. He also asserts such a test is warranted for design defect because consumers would otherwise lose under the risk-benefit analysis because of actual air bag safety statistics and the lack of any safer design. See id. at 687-89. 179. Volvo is a perfect example of how manufacturers continue to improve the safety of their vehicles. Volvo was responsible for developing numerous safety innovations such as the laminated windshield, the three-point seat belt system, and the integrated rear booster seat for children. 180. If potential plaintiffs were really misled as to air bag safety, then media coverage has made sure that potential jurors are misled as to their danger. Neither situation provides a good reason to assess air bag design based on consumer knowledge. 181. See, e.g., Knitzv. Minster Mach. Co., 432 N.E.2d 814 (Ohio 1982). 182. All passenger cars produced after August 31, 1997, and specified buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and light trucks manufactured after August 31,1998, are required to have both driver- and passenger-side air bags. See Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, Occu pant Crash Protection, 58 Fed. Reg. 46,553 (Sept. 2, 1993) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 571 and 585); 49 U.S.C.S. ? 30127(b). See also Certo, supra note 75, at 680; Condon, supra note 52, at 274.</page><page sequence="32">994 Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring 2003 (38:3) Since that time, air bags have received an increased level of media at tention. Air bag manufacturers have also begun to supply more specific information about air bag safety and performance in their instructions and warnings. Notably, the court of appeals in Hisrich v. Volvo was especially concerned at oral argument with the fact that Volvo knew for years that its air bags could kill children riding unbelted in the front passenger seat and yet did not set forth the specific consequences of "death" in its warn ings or instructions.183 The numerous warnings about air bags on the Volvo 950 GLT, in the manual, and on the videotape began with the word "WARNING" and then instructed occupants to always wear seat belts and to place children in the rear safety seat.184 In 1993, federal law did not yet require any warnings about the potential danger of air bags.185 In fact, Volvo was the only au tomobile manufacturer with an air bag-equipped vehicle to have any warn ings on the passenger side.186 In 1992, prior to the death of Diana Zhang, 183. See Hisrich, 226 F.3d at 448; Some manufacturers were aware, as far back as 1969, of the dangers posed by air bags to out of position occupants. See Warren Brown and Cindy Skrzycki, U.S. Doubts on Air Bags Date to '69; No Warnings Issued on Suspected Danger to Small Passengers, Wash. Post., Nov. 21, 1996, at Al; see also Werber, supra note 1, at 39 ("'warning' is used to show that serious injury or death could result"). 184. The numerous warnings and instructions were highlighted in bold with capital letters. All of the safety information was replete with declarations not to place a child in the front seat. Rather, Volvo urged parents to place their child in the back booster seat made for children or, at least, in the back seat with the seat belt securely fastened: WARNING! As its name implies, SRS is designed, to be a SUPPLEMENT to?not a replacement for?the three-point seat belt system... (Defendants' Exhibit HHH-3, APX 152) (emphasis sic.) Another page pronounced: WARNING! (Passenger side air bag) Occupants in the front passenger's seat must never sit on the edge of the seat, sit leaning toward the instrument panel or otherwise sit out of position. The occupant's back must be as upright as comfort allows and be against the seat back with the seat belt properly fastened. Children must never be allowed to stand in front of the passenger seat. Also on that page: WARNING! Do not use child safety seats or child booster cushions/backrests in the front passenger's seat. We also recommend that children who have outgrown these devices sit in the rear seat with the seat belt properly fastened. In the manual itself, there were six text boxes concerning air bag safety, in addition to the accompanying instructions, as well as pictures demonstrating proper use. There were also warnings on the visor and the doorjamb of the vehicle, as well as a videotape. Appellees' Final Brief, citing to inter alia various portions of the trial transcript and appellate record in Hisrich. 185. Prior to September 1, 1994, FMVSS 208 had no provisions concerning air bag safety warning labels. 186. Appellees' Final Brief, citing Trial Transcript at R. 78, TR 48, APX 585. Moreover, none of the warnings of other manufacturers instructed parents to place their children in the back seat.</page><page sequence="33">Consumer Expectations and Defective Air Bag Design 995 the NHTSA also issued a press release of "air bag facts" that apprise the public of their risks.187 The press release explained: There appears to be a strong public expectation that an air bag should deploy in most crashes and provide complete protection. Air bags are a remarkable safety advance, but they are not a panacea. Like any safety equipment, they have limitations and must be used with the lap/shoulder belt for maximum benefit. An air bag deployment is a very rapid forceful event. This is necessary to counteract the violent forces to which humans are subjected in a serious crash. Sometimes the bag itself may cause injury, but typically these are very minor in comparison to the injuries that would have occurred if the vehicle were not equipped with an air bag.188 Today, federal law mandates that manufacturers must detail the degree of danger such as serious injury or death for failing to heed air bag warn ings or instructions.189 Given the fact that the media have faired poorly as risk communicators about air bag safety and performance, govern ment- and manufacturer-provided information should be increasingly significant in the level and accuracy of consumer awareness. Conse quendy, those jurisdictions that prevent claims of defective air bag design to be assessed against consumer expectations may not preclude use of the test in the future. In fact, the design of air bag safety systems might not only be tested eventually under the consumer expectations standard as they gain notori ety, but the manufacturer may also actually benefit from it.190 For example, liability could be barred under the consumer expectations test where per sons gradually learn of the danger involved in the products and come to 187. Press Release, Air Bag Facts, NHTSA (July 30, 1992). In 1993 as well, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the media all expressed con cern over the improper placement of infants and children and warned to restrain them in the rear seat away from the air bag system. See Certo, supra note 75, at 684-85, citing Kevin Clemens, Air Bags, But... the Safety Cushions Can Kill Children, Automobile, Sept. 1993, at 24, and Standard No. 208, 58 Fed. Reg. 46,551 at 46,555 (Sept. 2, 1993) (to be codified at 49C.F.R. pts. 57 land 585). 188. See id. 189. For vehicles produced after September 1, 1994, but before February 25, 1997, the NHSTA mandated that warnings about air bags be provided on sunvisor labels only. See Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, Occupant Crash Protection, 61 Fed. Reg. 46,551, 46,557, and 46,564 (Sept. 2,1993) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 571 and 585). These labels were similar to those provided by Volvo the year before. For vehicles manufactured after February 25, 1997, NHTSA requirements were much more detailed and delineated that the warning provide the severity of injuries as well as the danger to small children. See Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, Occupant Crash Protection, 61 Fed. Reg. 60,206 and 60,215-21 (Nov. 27, 1996) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 571). 190.

In other words, rather than use the expert to convince the jury that consumer expectations were met in any given case, expert testimony could be used to convince the judge that the consumer expectations test should not be used at all. Once the court has determined that the consumer expectations instruc tion will be given to the jury, other defense strategies might be to persuade the judge to provide a jury instruction listing various factors to assess the "reasonableness" of the consumer expectations.194 In that way, the con 191.

See Feigenson and Bailis, supra note 11, at 481, n.5. However, under the Third Restatement, "disappointment of consumer expectations may not serve as an independent basis for allowing recovery under ? 2(b), neither may comformance with consumer expectations serve as an independent basis for denying recovery."

See Brief of Appellee at 51-54, citing Trial Transcript. The argument that a consumer would have no reasonable expectation of safety as a matter of law while unbelted was not successful in the Hisrich case. But see Freas v. Prater Constr.

Hisrich v. Volvo, itself, may be distinguishable due to the relationship between the application of the consumer expectations standard and man ufacturer warnings.195 Often, courts have justified application of the con sumer expectations standard to test the design of scientific or new products if the manufacturer has in some way misled the consumer about the use of the product.196 In this way, manufacturers assume some level of culpability by removing the consumer's ability to make an informed choice. As a result, courts justify the application of the consumer expectations standard even though such expectations were erroneous because the manufacturer was responsible for creating them.197 When evaluating the application of the consumer expectations test on this limited basis, however, a court should carefully consider the manufac turer's warnings, instructions, and advertising in each case. Certainly, one manufacturer should not be held accountable for the inadequate or mis leading information provided by another competitor. Nor would it be fair to hold a manufacturer responsible for misleading information about the air bag safety system in one model vehicle in a lawsuit regarding a different model. V. CONCLUSION The role of the consumer in assessing air bag design is an emerging issue in the United States. Since the installation of air bag systems were first required by law, courts have continued to struggle to find the proper bal ance between automotive safety and business practicalities in light of the policies and objectives of strict products liability. Currendy, courts are equally divided as to where the proper balance should lie. Courts in three jurisdictions have rejected consumer knowledge as a basis for ascertaining design defect while three other courts have concluded that it is appropriate. No state supreme court, as yet, has addressed whether applying a consumer expectations theory to test the design safety and per formance of an air bag system is legally sound. Although use of the consumer expectations may not present an insur mountable obstacle to achieving a defense verdict, which test is utilized in 195. As discussed supra in note 191, the court of appeals also reversed the trial court decision to deny the "inadequate warning" claim. 196. See, e.g., Leichtamer v. Am. Motors Corp., 424 N.E.2d 568 (Ohio 1981); see also Karl A. Boedecker, Fred W. Morgan, and Jeffrey J. Stoltman, Excessive Consumption: Marketing and Legal Perspectives, 36 Am. Bus.

Although Hisrich may have yielded the same result under a consumer expectations analysis, the case was settled prior to trial on remand. 199. As discussed supra in note 99, four states have removed consumer expectations as a measure of design defect by legislation.</page></plain_text>
