<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL DORRIS Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context DURING THE PAST SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS, Native American people have pro- duced literature rich in diversity and imagery, ancient in tradition, and universal in significance. On the other hand, there is no such thing as "Native American litera- ture," though it may yet, someday, come into being. The roots of this apparent paradox are not difficult to examine or comprehend. "National" literatures, be they French, Sanskrit, Japanese, or whatever, emanate from and are the expressions of coherent aggregations of people. They tend to re- flect aspects of a shared consciousness, an inherently identifiable world-view, a col- lective understanding of custom, language, and tradition. The pool from which both artist and primary audience are culled is generally circumscribed by common lin- guistics. English literature is expected to be in English, and to be therefore accessi- ble first and foremost to English-speaking clients. If there had ever been a North American language called "Indian," the mode of communication within a society called "Indian," then there would undoubtedly be something appropriately labeled "Indian literature." But there was not, and is not. On the contrary, the pre-1492 Western Hemisphere was among the most linguisti- cally and culturally plural areas the world has ever known. The estimated ten to twenty million people who lived in what is today the United States and Canada spoke languages derived from no less than seven different language Families, each as distinct from the other as each was distinct from Indo-European. Within each of these Families, there existed many separate and mutually unintelligible languages, and within each language, the potential for a variety of diverse regional dialects was present. More than three hundred cultures, each differentiated to a greater or lesser degree by language, custom, history, and lifeway, were resident north of the Rio Grande at the time Columbus first accidently bumped into the Bahamas. Moreover, the lin- guistic affinity groupings were rarely even geographically clustered; for instance, languages belonging to the Athapaskan Family were spoken in Central Alaska (In- galik), near Hudson Bay (Chippewyan), on the Plains (Sarsi and Kowa Apache), in the Southwest (Navajo), and in California (Hupa). Interspersed between them were cultures using languages derived from the Algonquin, Peneutian, Uto-Aztecan, Ho- kan, Muskogean, or Eskimo-Aleut Families. Michael Dorris, a Modoc, is Chairman of the Native American Studies Program at Dartmouth College. He is currently the holder of a Guggenheim Fellowship and is the author of Native Americans: 500 Years After (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1975). COLLEGE ENGLISH Vol. 41, No. 2 * October 1979 147</page><page sequence="2">148 COLLEGE ENGLISH Heterogeneity in all things was the norm; a citizen of any Native North American culture could, upon a day's walk in any direction, encounter people who looked, spoke, believed, acted, dressed, and ordered their lives in ways altogether different than might be found in his or her home community. Societal diversity was accepted, tolerated, and assumed, and each group took pride in its own distinctive features, including its own oral (literary) traditions. Such a laissez-faire attitude towards cultural pluralism was in sharp contrast to the historical experience of most European societies. For a very long time the world, for Europeans, was simply Europe. Everyone in that uworld, though fluidly divided by national boundary or linguistic variance, shared several basic similarities; virtually everyone spoke languages derived from a single language Family, Indo-European. Moreover, the lingual affinities of pre-Colonial Europe were further re-enforced and formalized by a continent-wide culture which pervaded every stratum of society, the Judaeo-Christian religious tradition (complete with its own unifying lingua franca, Latin). Finally, the culture-bound European was unconscious heir to a political heritage of feudalism, emerging national states, and especially patrilineal dominance. Rulership hierarchy was commonly understood as the "proper" order of things, and the general expectation was that under normal circumstances men had pre-eminent power. The stage was therefore set for a perplexing and, for some, traumatic, encounter when trans-Atlantic contacts became protracted and formalized. Native Americans, quite familiar and at ease with the realities of cultural pluralism, were in a sense pre-adapted to regard the sudden appearance of "new" people with equanimity, and the historical record testifies that initially they did just that. Early-arriving Euro- peans were hosted and fed and sheltered and studied; they were regarded as neither gods nor demons, and their appearance probably did not seem more than a mildly interesting event to the ordinary Native American citizen. To the European ventur- ing for the first time beyond the cocoon of cultural similitude, however, the "discov- ery" of "Indians" in the Americas was a major event indeed. Almost invariably the explorers' first reaction was one of irrational denial. Surely these quintessentially un-European creatures (no clothes, no crosses, etc.) could not be human. Perhaps they were a new species of ape; perhaps manifested devils . . . but certainly not souls! Little wonder, therefore, that to these early European observers, all "Natives" of a particular geographic or pigmentary category "looked alike." Just as all inhabitants of Africa were once incorrectly labeled "Ethiopes," so too was the indigenous North American misclassified. It seems simply to have been assumed that because: a) all natives of North America lived in North America, and b) none of them were Euro- peans, then therefore c) they must all be the same. And to carry this fascinating logic a step further, to its obvious conclusion: d) because Europeans thought they were heading towards the Asian Indies when they collided with America, and e) since Europeans were never wrong, then f) these all-the-same people must of course be INDIANS! Thus was born in the myopic minds of a few culturally traumatized and geographically disoriented individuals a new ethnic group. It remained only to convince the members of the several hundred cultures in North America that there was no difference between them and that henceforth they should be prepared to be regularly mistaken for one another and to refer to them-</page><page sequence="3">Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context 149 selves collectively by an appellation marginally appropriate only to a trans-Pacific population they had never seen. Though it frustrated and infuriated generations of European and American administrators, it should come as no surprise that Mohawks steadfastly remained Mohawks, that Aleuts did not become Chickasaws, that Hopis persisted as Hopis, and that all regarded the suggestion that they do otherwise as a lunacy to be politely ignored. Sense and sensibility, however, often give way to the dictates of power, and the cultural dominance Europeans and their descendants came to exert in North America assured the persistance of the misnomer and its erroneous implications. The question of why Native Americans lost political control of their homelands is a complex issue. By and large, Native American societies had little pre-contact experi- ence in the activity known as "war." The idea of national conquest, total victory or defeat, or the development and evolution of a sophisticated military technology were conspicuously (relative to the European example) absent. This "liability," coupled with the lack of natural immunity most Native Americans displayed towards old world diseases-a pathology which resulted in the diminishment by almost 85% of the aggregate Native American population during the contact period-preordained a swift and relatively facile European accession in North America. The very survival and resurgence of indigenous peoples and cultures, and not the ease of their initial conquest, is the significant and somewhat miraculous point. Because the European perspective at least temporarily prevailed, it was entirely predictable that the lumping of all Native American cultures into the mythological "Indian" category persisted in the evolving Euro-American consciousness. Used as an adjective, the know-nothing and misleading term "Indian" often preceded, but in no way illuminated, such classifications as "music," "art," "history," "language," "religion," "philosophy," and "literature." There is certainly nothing generic about any of these activities for the native peoples of North America, though just as cer- tainly each and every Native American culture included unique expressions of them. Hence the term "American Indian Literature" is largely ambiguous and begs more questions than it answers. Does it refer, one may query, to the sum total of all oral literary traditions in each of more than three hundred mutually unintelligible lan- guages? If so, does such a category make any academic or even common sense? Clearly it would be a far less reasonable concept than its logical but obviously over- simplified analogue, "European Literature." Can such a genre, spuriously based on assumed, but non-existent, inherent similarities, yield any meaningful depth of in- sight? Would such a category stimulate the study of a single Native American lan- guage or aesthetic? Is it a helpful tool of scholarship or simply an excuse not to study, a rationale for dismissal on the grounds of over-complexity or inaccessibility? It may perhaps be argued that Native American literature, under this definition, is a reasonable idea in that a minute but growing fraction is becoming available via translation into the lingua franca of English. However, while this may well be a positive and promising development, the question persists: is there any intellectually sound reason for examining arbitrarily anthologized particles of many separate tradi- tions in connection with each other? On what grounds should or could one study under the same rubric a Shoshone (Uto-Aztecan Family) song, a Navajo (Athapas- kan) mountain chant, and a Cherokee (Hokan) quest tale? Why not also include a</page><page sequence="4">150 COLLEGE ENGLISH Tibetan hymn, a Latvian poem, or an Ashanti blessing? It would make no less sense. A course which attempts to unite "Native American literature's greatest hits" tends to become a vain search for commonalities which logically should not be there. In the process, the individual beauties, insights, and styles of the particular litera- tures are ignored or become oversimplified, and the resulting amalgam is often a dreary and sparkless mediocrity. By presenting the breadth of indigenous literatures superficially, each one of them is done a severe disservice. Unquestionably, an understanding of any national literature depends very much on an awareness of a larger cultural context. Without some knowledge of language, of history, of inflection, of the position of the story-teller within the group, without a hint of the social roles played by males and females within the culture, without a sense of the society's humor or priorities, without such knowledge, how can we, as reader or listener, penetrate to the core of meaning in an expression of literary art? The difficulty of gaining access to the literature of a different culture may be illustrated by an exemplary folktale (in translation) from the Tanaina (Athapaskan) culture of south-central Alaska. It might be titled, "The Beaver and the Porcupine Woman." It would be told to a general audience within the society, including the full range of ages from early childhood to grandparent; it would be told with gesticu- lation and exaggeration by a storytelling specialist. It would be expected to have different meanings to the various categories of listeners; it might be described as instructive, as entertaining, as re-enforcing, or as all three. But even with this fore- knowledge, and even admitting the obvious artificiality of reading versus hearing the story in a social and cultural context, and even allowing for the problems inherent in translating between languages and language families, can the story be understood without some inter-disciplinary, ethnographic attempt to know something about the culture which produced it? A brief version of the story, and a discussion of its meaning, follows. Once upon a time there was a porcupine woman. She was extremely fat. One day she decided to do some hunting on the far side of the river, so she went to the bank where she met a beaver. "Ilello," she said to him. "I need to do some hunting over there; will you ride me across on your back?" "I'd be glad to," replied the beaver. "IHop on." So the porcupine woman climbed on his back, and he started swimming for the other side. When he had almost made it, the porcupine woman said, "Oh my! I've forgotten to bring my sack. I'll need to go back to the other bank and get it." "All right," said the beaver, and swam back. Ile was panting while the porcupine woman went to get her sack. \ ler quills had become water-logged and she was even heavier than she looked. "Okay," she said, "let's go." So they started across again. The beaver was swimming much more slowly. When they had practically reached the other side, she said, "Oh my! I've forgotten to bring my needle. We'll have to go back and get it." This time the beaver didn't say anything-he didn't have enough breath! But he turned around and pulled them back to the shore and practically passed out while she got her needle. "I lurry up, now," she said as she climbed back on his back. I le could hardly keep his nose above water, she was so soaked and heavy, but he had almost made it to the far bank again when she said, "Oh my! I've forgotten my staff. We'll have to. ..." Before she had finished her sentence the beaver had flipped over in the water and dumped her into the river. I le dragged himself onto the bank and lay there half dead.</page><page sequence="5">Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context 151 She managed to make the shore too, and climbed up onto a bear path. When she had caught her breath, she turned on the beaver and quilled him to death.' The End In attempting to understand the sense of this superficially insignificant little vig- nette, (whose only English translation exists in a book intended for primary school children) let us commence with what it does not mean. It does not mean that Tanaina-speaking people literally believe that beavers and porcupines talk to each other, nor does it suggest that the anthropomorphic quality of the protagonists is more than a stylistic convention. To comprehend the story it is probably necessary to know several facts. First of all, the Tanaina live in an environment which could euphemistically be described as "difficult." Survival, especially in the wild, is always precarious. Further, the Tanaina were, in the pre-contact period, a non-literate people. Oral communication was therefore the method of cultural transmission, legal understanding, and mean- ingful communication. It is also necessary to know that a "staff," as mentioned in the story, functions as both a walking stick and a weapon; and that in the Tanaina symbol system, porcupines were supposed to be rather ponderous, dull-witted crea- tures, and beavers were thought to be energetic and industrious, but overly- spontaneous and erratic. Armed with this data, the story presumably will be more accessible. It is, after all, a lesson in contracts, with several additional minor themes. A listener within the culture would notice, for instance, that when the porcupine woman proposed pas- sage to the beaver, he agreed without any clarification of the terms. He should have said something to the effect that "I'll take you across one time, two at most," or "I'm at your disposal for the next fifteen minutes, no more." But he gave a basically open-ended agreement-made a contract-and hence the porcupine woman was per- fectly within her rights in both demanding that he return three times and in quilling him to death when he reneged. The story is not, however, without its object lesson for the porcupine women of this world. Her stated aim is to go hunting, and yet she initially sets out without the three essentials of that endeavor: a sack in which to carry home her game, a needle with which to sew up the intestines, and, most importantly, a weapon with which to hunt. True, she had an open-ended contract, but where does she wind up in the story? Sitting, exhausted, quills used up, and weaponless, not only on the wrong side of the river from her home (having in effect "burned her bridges" in her righ- teous indignation), but on a bear path! The hunter has become the hunted, and all because of her own improvidence. Told in the right context by the appropriate teller and to a cued audience, this little story has great impact. It is at once serious and comic; it underlines the binding nature of verbal agreements-and hence the caution with which one must proceed in entering into one; it comments upon fore-thought and the consequences of insisting upon total, though technically "just," retribution for an offense. It is a story replete 'A similar story can be found in Bill Vaudrin's excellently translated collection, Tanaina Tales From Alaska (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1969).</page><page sequence="6">152 COLLEGE ENGLISH with cultural values, and it acts as a vehicle for their transmission from one genera- tion to the next. In terms of the keys to its understanding, it has next to nothing in common with a Papago origin myth, a Chippewa "haiku" poem, or a capitulation oration attributed to Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce. But it is in just such company that it is likely to appear, if in fact it does appear, in a course titled "Native Ameri- can literature." As if it weren't impossible enough to subsume the extraordinarily large and di- verse corpora of traditional Native American oral literatures under the single rubric of "Indian literature," other types of writing as well are often included within the genre. By far the greatest volume of fiction pertaining to Native Americans has been written about them by non-Natives. Such works have enjoyed wide and consistent popularity among the Euro-American readership for at least the past three hundred years and have spawned such diverse offshoots as Wild West Shows, cowboy and Indian movies, boy scout ceremonies, and cigar-selling statues. Disregarding the obvious propagandists for an exaggerated image of Native Americans (either savage or unearthly noble), many serious authors have attempted to cope literarily with the existence and complexity of the "Redman." Rousseau and Shakespeare (let us not forget Caliban), Fenimore Cooper and Helen Hunt Jackson (her mournful Ramona has been translated into film more times than any other novel), Faulkner and Barth have all developed, marvelled over, and almost always eventually killed off Native American characters. Still other novelists have virtually built their careers on books about "the Indian world" and how to understand it. Novels of continuing sales popularity, such as Frank Waters' The Man Who Killed the Deer (1942) wherein Hopis oft appear to be telepathic as well as paranoid regarding the outside world, Oliver LaFarge's Laughing Boy (1929), Hal Borland's When the Legends Die (1963), and Edwin Corle's Fig Tree John (1971) give testimony to the abiding fascination Euro-Americans seem to have with "their" Indians. The basic storyline of these books and of their hundreds of less successful imitators is highly formalized. Initially the Natives of a small society are described as happy and mindless chil- dren. Garden of Eden imagery abounds and harmony reigns . . . until that fateful day when, through no fault of his or her own, a Child of the Forest is snatched from the nest and sent off into the Great White World to go to school, train for a job, join the army, or the like. Regardless of the task at hand, our hero fails and returns to his or her community in semi-disgrace. The protagonist may have been corrupted to the point of prostitution (such as Slim Girl in Laughing Boy) or only made contemptuous of the Native traditions (such as Martiniano, of The Man Who Killed the Deer, who insists on wearing shoes with heels). These characters are marginal, and as such pose apparently serious threats to the future stability of their communities. Eventually, usually after a long struggle (with periodic doses of supernatural intervention thrown in), the taint of the outside world is exorcized and the protagonists are brought back to the bosom of their tribes, either by ritual or through death. Slim Girl might well have paraphrased the famous nineteenth-century pronouncement in concluding that, for her, the only way to be a good Indian was to be a dead one. Such is the stuff that dreams are made of. White writers almost invariably portray Native American cultures as fragile, regressive, deteriorating entities, teetering on</page><page sequence="7">Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context 153 the brink of extinction. These fictitious societies give no evidence of internal vitality, rarely betray any sense of humor (Clair Huffaker's Nobody Loves a Drunken Indian [1967], long a runaway reservation best-seller, is a notable exception), and confirm to the white reader that contact with Euro-Americans was the most significant event in the forty-thousand-year history of Native people on this continent-indeed, their citizens seem unable to think or talk of anything else. The novels which often sur- face in "American Indian literature" courses are sociologically dubious and suggest at best an individual etic (outsider's) perspective-yet they are often treated with an obsequious reverence bordering on the unctuous. Whatever their intentions, these books are too often mistaken for ex cathedra pronouncements about "real" Indian life, and as such they re-enforce debilitating stereotypes (e.g., other-worldly Natives) and depict Native societies where change is anathema. Little wonder that tourists visiting reservations, upon viewing a person clad in other than a blanket, riding in something other than a dog-pulled travois, bemoan the "obvious" loss of culture; somehow they seem oblivious to the fact that they themselves are not passing through on a covered wagon and wearing homespun dickeys. An additional liability posed by these novels is in their perpetuation of the stereotype that Native Americans, even when conversing with each other in their own language, find it impossible to speak articulately and to the point. If one had only the evidence of these novels to go by, one might well conclude that metaphor formed the basis of every indigenous thought pattern. This ritualized form of lan- guage, the bastardized product of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century clerical trans- lators at treaty conferences, has become so associated with Native American utter- ance that today its usage in certain circles is practically mandatory to insure ethnic credibility. A debate recently raged within a Northwest Coast tribal community regarding a collection of translated, traditional stories to be used in the classroom. The elder, non-English speaking members of the community argued strongly for the inclusion of scatalogical and sexual allusions-maintaining that censorship had never been exercised towards children in the past. More "progressive" tribal members, con- cerned with public image, wanted the book to include only "proper" and unspicy language. They lost and the literature won, but such victories are rare. Insistence on a single "appropriate" manner of Native self-presentation has had wide effect and certainly may be observed in the final category of literature to be discussed here: the writings in English by Native people and about "Native" themes. Historically the earliest examples of this mode are largely confessional and co-authored (or dictated) autobiographies: Black Elk Speaks (Lakota), Crashing Thunder (Winnebago), Two Leggings (Crow), Mountain Wolf Woman (Winnebago), and the two Charles Eastman (Lakota) books, Soul of the Indian and Old Indian Days, all of which appeared in the first half of the twentieth century. These works differ from the traditional literatures of their authors' respective tribes in at least two overall re- spects: they were originally composed in a foreign language (English), and their intended audience is primarily Euro-American and not tribal. As such they are writ- ten to conform to the aesthetic of their day; their language, organization, style, and points of emphasis give greater testimony to the popular fashion of American litera- ture than they do to the indigenous rules of expression of the "teller." The influence exerted by the non-Native transcriber-ranging from very great in the case of John</page><page sequence="8">154 COLLEGE ENGLISH Neihardt (Black Elk Speaks) to blessedly non-intrusive for Nancy Lurie (Mountain Wolf Woman)-cannot be discounted. N. Scott Momaday, the most celebrated contemporary Native American of let- ters, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his novel, House Made of Dawn (1967). The book deals creatively with a variety of "Native American" themes, both in a reserva- tion community and in an urban/outside-world setting. Furthermore, Momaday is in a position to bring a bi-cultural perspective to his subject matter. He writes of a context with which he is familiar in an emic (insider's) sense, and thereby lends credibility to the notion that this book is truly a Native American's "statement," though certainly not the Native American point of view. However, House Made of Dawn is told not in the Kiowa (Momaday's tribe and the focus of his two more personal statements, The Way to Rainy Mountain [1969] and The Names [1976]) or Pecos (the protagonist's tribe) tradition, but in highly literate, formally stylized and conventionally laudable English. As such, it is at the same time available to a wide audience, most of which is totally unlearned about Native American lifestyles and presumed values, but it is inaccessible to the majority of contemporary Native American people, most of whom know quite a bit about the parameters and stresses of their own existence but lack a fluent literacy in English. Momaday and a growing number of ethnically Native American writers in English (or Spanish), therefore, fulfill a rather non-traditional artistic role; rather than primarily interpreting or bringing out a fresh vision of society for their context communities, they are interpolating and translating their communities for another culture. Certainly this intermediary function did not originate with Momaday; he may, in House Made of Dawn, be best understood as a Native American Henry James, Ralph Ellison, or James Joyce. There is a danger, however, that the American reading audience may take Momaday's books as literal statements of fact rather than as the products of artistic imagination and license. It can certainly be argued that this confusion of literature and sociology is more prevalent in cases where either the central themes and contexts are unfamiliar and somewhat exotic to the general reader, or there exists a political state of dominance/subordination between the two "bridged" communities. Momaday writes of an unglorious period in American history known to Native Americans as the "Relocation" years. Abel, his protagonist, undergoes successive, externally-conceived experiences of forced assimilation: the army and urban reloca- tion. He is not simply a rural person removed from a familiar context, but an Indian in a hostile, white America. The author further accentuates the Native American orientation of his novel by presenting the events not in a chronologically unfolding "progressive" sequence, but bounded within the limits of the book's almost identical opening and closing segments. Thus sandwiched, the bulk of the novel appears to exist within a cyclical context-certainly a common mode in many Native American literatures. Finally, Momaday seems to soften the book's rather bleak realities by the occasional interjection of parts of a Navajo chant which promises recurrent, if not present, hope, beginning, potential-"dawn." House Made of Dawn is thus firmly rooted in a generalized "Indian" context, but it translates and interprets that experience for a non-Native audience. Abel is not "every Indian"-or maybe even "anylndian." He is not the product of his background</page><page sequence="9">Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context 155 (and therefore "representative"), but he rather moves through it in his own unique way. Writers of many cultures-from Steinbeck to contemporary Chicano novelists-also have written of the California experience; large segments of Moma- day's work should be viewed in that "immigration" context, and not as a set of norms to which all Indians are likely to conform. However, it is virtually inevitable when writing about Native Americans in a contact situation and in English that certain stereotypes of language and cultural behavior will be reenforced, especially if the failure syndrome and supernatural sen- sitivities of previous "Indian" protagonists (Martiniano, Laughing Boy, Tom Black Bull [When the Legends Die], Ramona, etc.) are echoed. Formulary roles, conclusions, and situations replace humanity and individual diversity. Indian characters are vali- dated and made credible by acting in ritualized patterns, speaking in archaic slogans, and, above all, nobly not succeeding. Euro-American interest in Native Americans, occasionally bordering on mania, is as old as contact history itself; and bonafide Native American authors are sufficiently rare that their works too often tend to be treated as revelation (the enduring campus popularity of Black Elk Speaks, with its obvious translation complications, is a case in point). Native-created protagonists may fallaciously assume the proportions, for some readers, of EveryIndian-underlining anew the old, hopeful dogma that "they" must really be all alike. Flesh-and-blood Native Americans at variance in dress, thought, or activity from this instant, yet too familiar, prototype are accused of "losing their culture." Myth both becomes and predicts the "acceptable" ethnic reality, and the diversity, past and present, of Native American cultures is once again ignored. Clearly popular taste in "Indian literature" is directed by historical misinforma- tion; "Indians" are most familiar and recognizable when ahorse and inarticulate. Indeed, according to the nineteenth-century literary convention (as exemplified by The Yemassee, for instance), tribal members could not even speak grammatically in their own "tongues"! The genre, then, can function as a kind of ethnohistorical freeze, leaving Native Americans bereft of and precluded from cultural dynamism and condemned to a static and zoo-like future. Obviously the social history of Native/Euro-American relations lends itself to exploitation through literature; and it particularly taxes creative artists, such as Momaday, who are attempting to break new ground. His Way to Rainy Mountain is a classic of traditional Kiowa literature, but composed in English. It cannot be under- stood, however, without major reference to its context and tribal symbol system. It may misleadingly appear, like much oral literature when transcribed, simple and straightforward; the non-Kiowa reader who approaches this work in isolation will, unfortunately, miss much of its depth and hence most if its real beauty and signifi- cance. The previously-mentioned Tanaina tale of the Beaver and the Porcupine Woman demonstrates the importance of cultural references for interpretation. Such ethnographic and historical materials, albeit of varying quality, exist for every Na- tive society, and increasingly they are being published by the tribes themselves. It is imperative to set the study of any work of traditional Native American literature in the context provided by information about the culture of particular tribes. Further, contrary to the popular stereotype, Native American societies are not one-dimensional and fixated on days gone by. Native Americans live, in every sense</page><page sequence="10">156 COLLEGE ENGLISH of the word, in the twentieth century and are well aware of the existence of the rest of the modern world. There is a new and maturing generation of Native American people, both on reservations and in urban communities, who are by necessity cul- turally adaptive. Their primary language of expression is English, but an English accommodated to the special needs of their individual tribal histories and realities. In their literature, whether oral or written, this transformed English is adjusted to accord with their particular traditional aesthetic. The prose and poetry of such major young writers as James Welch, Leslie Silko, and Simon Ortiz demonstrate the complexity and richness of this emerging category of Native American writing. Their works fall squarely within the traditions of his- torical, ethnic communities and so they tend to expand the scope of English- language composition and criticism. Their creations exhibit qualities rarely found in fictional, English-language Indians-humor, irony, intelligence, and stamina. Their characters are good and bad in ordinary human, rather than spectacularly exotic, ways, and they share complicated and changing relationships with each other and the world. Welch in particular has evidenced an artistic command spanning and uniting tri- bal and American literary traditions. His first novel, Winter in the Blood (1974), has been widely read and acclaimed by both Native and non-Native readers. In this book about people who happen to be Native Americans living on a reservation in Montana, their culture is not depicted as a Hollywood version of the nineteenth- century, and, while it clearly has much in common with rural, white-American society, it is also distinctly Native. It is a book about poverty but also about the survival, against great odds, of tradition and of people. Together w ith such works as Leslie Silko's Ceremony (1977), it may well be among the first manifestations of a new era in Native American literary expression; at long last a pan-tribal tradition of true "Native American literature" may be happening. As should by now be obvious, designing a curriculum in which to teach the literature of indigenous North America is arduous and often frustrating. If the ap- proach is too facile, too generalized, or too shallow, the effort itself may be counter-productive and it may promote, rather than discourage, cultural stereotyp- ing and ethnocentrism. Native American cultures and their respective literatures are not ornamental and historical artifacts of America's past, but are both ancient and on-going-and as complicated as those of any other of the world's peoples. If not approached with this awareness, these diverse and complex cultures and literatures can be made to appear cute, childish, one-dimensional, and boring. Diluting any literature, much less that of a traditionally oppressed and misun- derstood group of peoples, serves little purpose. Trying to create a multi-ethnic course or unit simply perpetuates the old Euro-American notion that everything not European must somehow be "the same" and a bit inferior (i.e., not worthy of serious scrutiny). For too long the literary creations of Native American peoples have been buried in grade-school libraries or obscured by poor translations. Such practice does a severe disservice to all concerned. It deprives the student of the wealth of human experience, insight, and imagination bound up in each and every tradition, and it deprecates the brilliance and complexity of ancient and fascinating civilizations. The oral-literary tradition is a cornerstone of every tribal society. It is the vehicle through which wisdom is passed from one generation to the next and by which</page><page sequence="11">Native American Literature in an Ethnohistorical Context 157 sense is made of a confusing world. It is responsible in large part for the education, entertainment, and inspiration of the community, and as such its study offers the opportunity, to seriously interested outsiders to experience new and provocative visions of reality. To investigate any Native American literature one must examine its evolution and development though time; one must know something of the language-its rules, its implied world view-of its creation; one must know something of the culture's his- tory of contacts with other peoples, both Native American and Euro-American; and one must know something of the modern social setting of the culture. The study of Pueblo literature, for instance, must begin with an awareness of the language and philosophy of the creation stories. It is important to realize a special archaic lan- guage exists within the culture exclusively for the transmission of rote-memorized, sacred literature. One must then proceed through a reading of the myth cycles, the historical sagas, the riddles and songs and religious chants, the treaties and diaries and autobiographies, and then continue with the work of Ortiz-Going for the Rain (1976)-and Silko. There is no shortcut to this or any other Native American litera- ture. If the study appears easy, something is wrong-for it is truly difficult to cross the boundaries of culture and time and class and language and see the world through another's eyes. The effort, however, is not without its rewards for the perseverant. Even today, the student reared and nurtured in the Euro-American tradition of expected homogeny is shocked and astounded to discover that cultural pluralism is real, that people can actually think, believe, and act differently and still be people. To learn that Indians, heretofore perceived as "vanished" or in terms of Halloween and Thanksgiving, are not only contemporary but also interesting on an intellectual level is no small educational accomplishment; and to finally understand that each Native American nation has a unique and rich history, language, and culture is a revelation indeed. Though the process is long and demanding, to uncover this reality for but one tribe, one people-be they Pueblo or Lakota, Ashanti or Ainu, Eskimo or Malay-is to understand and appreciate it by inference for all the rest. The discovery of just one other way of being and becoming human puts to rest forever, for that discover- er, the destructive myth of a Euro-American monopoly on civilization, or language, or humanity.
