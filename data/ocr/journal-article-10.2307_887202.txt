<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paris and Munich Francis Bacon The first full retrospective of Francis Bacon's work since he died in 1992 might well have been an occasion for trepidation. Would the old warhorse be plunged into that limbo of indifference or derision that is often the fate of celebrated painters not of the first rank, in the period immediately fol- lowing their death? The exhibition recently at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (closed 14th October and now, with modifi- cations, at the Haus der Kunst, Munich, to 26th January)' was planned with the mixed blessing that the artist himself was no longer there to censor or tailor the selection, as had been his habit with earlier shows. A further advantage was that the selector, David Sylvester, was given the opportunity to test, in prestigious circumstances, his long-pondered evaluation of the painter's development. Both these factors ensured the success of the project as a whole, making it far more revealing than, for example, the 1985 Tate Gallery retrospective with its rump of later work and its lean catalogue, cut down at Bacon's insistence. With some eighty paintings ranging from 1933 to 1990, two years before Bacon's death, and a handful of works on paper, the Paris showing was arranged chronological- ly. The early work was hung in small, booth- like spaces, the exhibition gradually open- ing out into a series of increasingly larger rooms culminating in the display of the big late triptychs. The crowds and the light were the hazards of seeing the show, the for- mer overwhelming in the early part, and the changes in the latter considerably inflecting Bacon's colour and the amount of reflection in the uniformly glazed exhibits. Suddenly to see oneself superimposed full-length on top of a naked Henrietta Moraes with a syringe in her arm is a mortifying experi- ence. The paintings up to the mid-1960s held hardly a dud and the swift establishment of Bacon's particular world was enthralling.2 The now recognisable sources - in Muy- bridge, Eisenstein, Poussin, Bufiuel, Picasso - are submerged in Bacon's personal mise- en-scene derived from modernist interiors, hotel rooms and the curtained platforms of press conferences seen in magazines and on news-reels. The memory of people's legs distorted under glass table tops of the kind Bacon himself designed, must have remained with him as surely as their spare tubular steel geometry. The ghoulish Head I and Head HI(1948 and 1949; cat. nos.8 and 9), reminiscent of the buried living statues in Chien Andalou, evoke the operating theatre and cameras on tripods (even more appar- ent in a destroyed painting of c. 1936). Fig- ures are caged, barred or boxed a la Nuremberg, sometimes raised on platforms like a model's throne, on scarcely indicated chairs or divans, railings restricting their movement. Closed curtains and drawn blinds, shallowing the picture space, pro- vide backgrounds, as though the figures had to be screened from the gaze of a more orthodox world. In the early paintings, Bacon's figures are male and dominant, whether Velizquez's Pope Innocent X or tough-looking besuited men, their grin crossed with a snarl, neat collars, ties and shirt cuffs adding a frisson of orderliness to their alarming presence (as in Study for a por- trait of 1953; no.21; Fig.80, and Man in blue Iof 1956; no.28). Bacon's colour at this time is at its most direct, influenced by newsprint photos and reproductions of paintings. It sometimes has a grand edge to it with its papal purples and golds, heraldic oranges and midnight blues trimmed with white ermine. At others it is post-war threadbare or even decisively crude. The paint is dry and sparely handled, unprimed canvas showing through in the dark backgrounds that Bacon generally pre- ferred from c.1952 through to the end of that decade. There is great finesse and deli- cacy in some of the heads and figures, as though wounds were being tenderly dressed. The influence of photographs is seen in the unfocused mobility with which Bacon invests his figures where light thins volume to render the subject insubstantial yet vivid. Nowhere is this better seen than in the enigmatic Studyfrom the human body (1949; no.11), the Three studies of the human head (1953; no.26) and the beautiful Studyforpor- trait III (After the life mask of William Blake) of 1955 (no.30).

But his stint as an inte- rior designer obviously gave him a ground- ing in textures and finish, even influencing the choice of gold frames and glazing in which his works were invariably shown. This elegance of handling and presentation disclosing imagery that is unusually but not uniquely disturbing (particularly in the 1960s) provides consistent tension. It is astonishing how often Bacon clears this highjump of violence and chic. There are only a few works in the show which fail in this respect. One or two others fail for dif- ferent reasons- an ill-judged spatial relation between figure and setting as in the Pope- inspired Study for portrait VII (1953; no.23) or a disastrous deviation into painterly 'abstraction' as in Figure in mountain landscape (1956; no.32). The first paintings in the exhibition are two canvases, Interior ofa room (no. 1) and Fig- ures in a garden (no.2), both from the mid- 1930s and thus rare survivors of Bacon's later blitzes on his early work. The Interior, though not especially successful, contains several elements which, separated out, became part of Bacon's familiar imagery.3 Figures in a garden (Fig. 78) is more interesting in that it shows the figure- surely only one ? - in an attitude of nervous contemplation, its teeth and ear aggressively highlighted, the head and shoulders against three abstract horizontal bands of colour, the 79.

Picasso and to some extent Matisse are both detectable in the two works but the influ- ence of Bacon's mentor in the 30s, Roy de Maistre, is strong in the first painting (com- pare the de Maistre reproduced in the Pom- pidou catalogue, p.289). The second shares several characteristics avant la lettre with the Neo-romantic painters of the 40s. Though Bacon far outstripped their tinted anxieties, there are obvious connexions with their re- formulations of the human figure as seen in the work of Sutherland, Colquhoun and Ceri Richards. Sutherland was close to Bacon in the post-war period and the nature of their aesthetic relationship has yet to be fully explored - a question not helped by Bacon's sharp repudiation in later years of Suther- land's work. The influence certainly went both ways. The anthropomorphic thrust of Sutherland's thorny boughs and tapering tree trunks of 1940 is of the same aesthetic world as Bacon's Three studies for figures at the base ofa Crucifixion (1944; no.4); the flat pan- elling in the background of this and other works (Figure study II; 1945-46; no.4) appears in paintings by Sutherland both before and after its occurrence in Bacon, notably in the Northampton Crucifixion (worked on in 1944-46) and in the 1954 Portrait of Edward Sackville-West (Fig.79) which in turn seems indebted to Bacon in its dissolving legs, sharply-drawn suit and air of high anxiety. In his years of celebrity, Bacon became so obsessively self-isolating, flinging derogato- ry epithets at the head of every contempo- rary artist, that much evidence which might 80 have clarified his sources was destroyed. The example of Sickert's work, both early and late, has on several occasions been tied to Bacon's evolution and there is a rumour, so far unverified, that he once owned a Camden Town period painting.4 There were numerous opportunities for Bacon to have seen Sickert's work of all periods in the 1930s and 40s in London galleries which Bacon knew and where he occasionally exhibited. The use of photography with its adventitious permissions was crucial to both artists but it is only one of many remarkable similarities in pose, setting, facture and feel- ing. There comes a moment in the exhibition, just under the half-way mark, when the familiar later Bacon emerges from the long- hatching chrysalis as the international fig- ure of the triptychs, the Marlborough Galleries artist with world-wide exhibitions and a fat catalogue raisonn6 to himself. The change occurred when Bacon's technique suddenly leapt forwards, enabling him to capture the kind of figurative mobility he had long been chasing, now achieved through risk and accident rather than linear repetition and spectral handling of paint. Although there are earlier hints of this change (in the 1959 head of Muriel Belcher, for example; no.35) it is with the Guggen- heim Museum's Three studies for a crucifixion (1962; no.37; Fig.81) that it becomes most grandly apparent. This was Bacon's first triptych since 1944. It is more complex in its disposition of images than Three studies ... (no.4) and announces those painterly smears and swipes that define, through elimination of expected description, Bacon's sense of organically spontaneous images as against the 'willed articulation' of earlier works which he had begun to find 843</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 81. Three studies for a crucifixion, by Francis Bacon. 1962. 80 by 57 (each). (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; exh. Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris). oppressive. From then onwards Bacon's technical prowess, a gymnastic conflation of chance and intention, was assured and there are passages throughout the rest of the show in which heads and bodies are mirac- ulously vouchsafed. The Guggenheim triptych is also a spec- tacular example of Bacon's grievous bodily harm, the blood-spattered figure on a bed in the central canvas hardly less horrific than the upside-down human carcass on the right. The word horrific (often used with a whiff of moral turpitude) repeatedly occurs in the early literature on Bacon, as was to be expected in the generally tame world of British art in the 1950s and early 60s. Today, the work seems less minatory; we have become, in Henry James's phrase, 'consenting victims' of the horror. Even so, only a handful of works in Paris - the Guggenheim triptych was one - seemed especially gory (and the appalling Muy- bridge-inspired paralytic child at the Stedelijk, Amsterdam, was not included). What became increasingly apparent in the later rooms was the anguish of Bacon's personal world, including both the self-con- fessed riskiness of his ambitions as an artist - an old-fashioned European figurative artist at that, desperate for aesthetic certainties - and his abrasive confrontations with a meaningless existence. It was 'on with the show', no matter how unmitigatedly awful the show might be; old age, private tragedies and loneliness were faced, on can- vas at least, with Bacon's customary 'exhila- rated despair' and a frozen dignity. After the fine early 70s triptychs memorialising his dead lover George Dyer, anti-hero of this part of the exhibition, some of the later works, in spite of a volley of mannerisms, repetitions and chronically theatrical rhetoric, achieve a resigned though not complacent grandeur. The 1985-86 trip- tych of self-portraits (no.82) is hardly serene but it has an authentic gravity of mood and unaffected simplicity. One of the perhaps not even incidental pleasures of this show was the revelation of Bacon's gifts as a por- traitist. Such works as Three studies for portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne (1965; no.45) and Three studies of Muriel Belcher (1966; no.49) along with later images of Dyer andJohn Edwards (the features of both these models are alarm- ingly merged in the 1986 portrait of the lat- ter; no.83) give Bacon an honourable place in the history of portraiture. Bacon's place in the history of art is another matter. He is perhaps overrated as a universal commentator on the human predicament and underrated as a brilliant and innovatory technician. The superb Paris show revealed a painter of wider scope than is customarily perceived but also one with an often unsympathetic sensibility, too caustically narrow to swing him into the first flight of artists. But he created a world that is as precise in its pungent imagery as is the world of Eliot's Sweeney or the menacingly erotic landscape of Pinter.5 It has its limits but, at best, its vitality of attack and plunge into uncharted territory are uplifting.

The catalogue is an outstanding contribution to the literature on Bacon, with almost every work fully catalogued and discussed, alongside illuminating texts and with an invaluable illustrated chronology containing new information. 2Only two important early works are missing: Painting (1946, MoMA, New York) and Twofigures (1953, pri- vate collection); the former is too fragile to travel. 3I would suggest that this painting was the Studio interior exhibited in February 1934 at Bacon's Transition Gallery show in London. Its provenance includes the artist's faithful cousin, Diana Watson, who bought two works on paper at this show (one exhibited here as cat. no.89), both of 1933. No.89 contains a similar Picasso- derived figure as found in Studio interior. 4For a preliminary account of Sickert and Bacon see R.
