Contextualized within the theoretical schools of the anthropology of technology and using the chaine operatoire methodology, the approach advanced here quantifies the relationships between technology, society, and aesthetics in the production of Paleolithic art. Focusing on Pavlovian art, dating to between 28,000 and 24,000 radiocarbon years BP, this paper assesses the suite of art production technologies, particularly those used when modifying and decorating ivory, and traces the relationship between decorative techniques and other characteristics of art. These analyses offer insight into Pavlovian art traditions and the emergence of innovative techniques in Paleolithic societies. Keywords Art • Technology • Chaine operatoire • Gravettian Introduction Archaeologists increasingly acknowledge the intimate relationships between technological choices and artistic production (Conkey 1995; Dobres 2000). Scholars studying some of the world's earliest art are beginning to explore the ways that material and technical choices impacted the appearance of art and reflected variable social values and priorities (Soffer 2000; Stiner 2003; Vanhaeren and d'Errico 2005, 2006). The tenets of the anthropology of technology (Lemonnier 1993) and chaine operatoire method and theory (Dobres 2000; Leroi-Gouhran 1964; Schlanger 1993) establish that artists and craftspeople working in different physical and social environments will enact gestures and produce art in different ways. Tracing the sequential stages involved in the production of a piece of art, following the chaine R.

Embellishing the surface of an art object in a process most archaeologists term "engraving" is common to many artistic chaines operatoires. Decorative surface incisions contribute fundamental artistic characteristics and impact the object's overall appearance and style. The extent of these marks may influence the perceived naturalism of figurative art, or the concentration of marks on a single face of a three-dimensional sculpture may impose a privileged or preferred viewpoint on both figurative and non figurative art. Equally, incised patterns on objects that were otherwise minimally modified from their natural morphology are one way that archaeologists can distinguish those objects from other non-decorative artifacts and faunal remains. This paper documents the distinct modes of surface embellishment and incision, and the gestures invoked in the production of these decorations. This analysis focuses on a discrete assemblage of both non-figurative (e.g., Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 5) and figurative (e.g., Fig. 4) art from Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) sites in Central Europe. This paper seeks to identify the range of gestures and chaines operatoires used to make surface marks and subsequently considers their cultural and technological scope. It traces their occurrence across art assemblages from numerous sites and art made in several different raw materials. The social, aesthetic, and stylistic consequences of these technological choices are then discussed. Some implications of this fine-scaled analysis of the technologies of art will be proposed.

Scale is in centimeters Because this paper will discuss both figurative and non-figurative Paleolithic art, these two classes of artifacts must be defined. Paleolithic figurative or representa tional art typically depicts humans and animals. Famous female figurines like the so-called Venus of Willendorf are one common example of this category of art. Non figurative Paleolithic art, sometimes called "schematic" art, is defined here as artifacts that do not include recognizable (naturalistic or abstract) human or animal forms, but which do feature other surface embellishments or modifications to their shape suggesting symbolic behavior. Common examples of Paleolithic non figurative decorations include zigzag, wave, and chevron patterns, as well as parallel or intersecting lines. Artifacts which lack surface engravings but which were sculpted into an imposed morphology that does not resemble a human or animal form may also be classified as non-figurative art.

An Introduction to the Research Histories and Context of Pavlovian Art and Society Hundreds of portable art objects have been excavated from Gravettian occupation sites in the Czech Republic with radiocarbon dates that cluster between 28,000 and 24,000 years before present1 (Svoboda et al. 1996:141; van der Plicht 1997). These sites are considered part of the "Pavlovian" culture, named after the eponymous Pavlov I site (Delporte 1959; Klima 1959). The center of Pavlovian occupation has traditionally been identified around the Pavlov Hills in South Moravia, where the Dolni Vestonice-Pavlov sites were found within a few hundred meters of each other (see recent discoveries in Svoboda et al. 2009). The numerous large and roughly contemporaneous sites concentrated in this small area have prompted archaeologists to interpret them as culturally related or as evidence of a palimpsest of occupations along this hillside (Soffer 2000; Svoboda 2003; Svoboda et al. 1996, 2000). Further afield, the site of Predmosti in Northern Moravia offers evidence of a similar archaeological culture beyond the Pavlov Hills. The burial of Brno II, in the modern city of Brno, provides evidence of Gravettian-aged burial practices (Oliva 2000). Skeletal remains from a single male individual were found here alongside an unusual assemblage of symbolic material culture (Fig. 6). Predmosti was first excavated in the late 1800s (see Svoboda et al. 1994), using what are now considered antiquated excavation techniques. Fine-scaled spatial and relational information about finds were not recorded during these initial excavations, which limits the types of analysis that may be done. Excavations at Dolni Vestonice 1 In keeping with the existing literature on Pavlovian archaeology, all dates presented in this paper are given in uncalibrated radiocarbon years before present. Springer</page><page sequence="5">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 129 I (hereafter DV I) began in the 1920s, with subsequent excavations in the 1970s and 1990s (see Verpoorte 2001: 38). Although the more recent excavations of DV I employed modern methodologies, most art objects were found during initial excavations in the 1920s and 1930s, so spatial information about these finds is limited (see Verpoorte 2001). Both Predmosti and DV I were excavated by several different teams of archaeologists who had diverse research aims and used different excavations methodologies. Pavlov I was excavated much more recently, starting in the 1950s, by a single archaeologist, B. Klima, so the excavation methodologies employed here were more uniform and modern. Consequently, the finds from Pavlov I preserve better spatial information and have been more rigorously analyzed (Novak 2005, contributions to Svoboda 1994, 1997, 2005). The isolated Brno II burial was excavated in the late 1800s as part of rescue archaeological excavations during construction in the Brno city center. An associated settlement site was not uncovered, and the artifacts and skeletal remains that were discovered were not recorded with a spatial context. Thus, it remains difficult to build a clear stratigraphic or contextual understanding of the finds from Brno II (see further discussion in Oliva 2000). Some Pavlovian settlement sites preserve what may be palimpsests of repeated, episodic occupation. Radiocarbon dates from DV I suggest a long, possibly episodic or periodic occupation, with dates as early as 31,700±1,000 BP (GrN-11189) and as late as 25,820±170 BP (GrN-18188) (Svoboda et al. 1996: 136). However, most art objects were found in the middle and upper parts of the DV I site, and Verpoorte (2001: 40) suggested approximate dates in the range of c. 26,000 years BP for these sections of the site. The chronology at the nearby Pavlov I site is less complicated, and radiocarbon dates from the southeastern section of the site cluster between 26,730±250 BP (GrN-4812) and 25,020±150 BP (GrN-1325). Verpoorte (2001: 58), following observations from KHma's initial excavations, suggests there might be two occupation phases preserved at the site. The stratigraphy at Predmosti remains unclear in many places, but the site has yielded radiocarbon dates of 26,870±250 BP (GrN-6801) and 26,320±240 BP (GrN-6852) (Verpoorte 2001: 72). Importantly, Predmosti, Pavlov I, and DV I all have radiocarbon dates in the range of 26,000 BP, suggesting that they may have been occupied around the same time period, although not necessarily contemporaneously. The Brno II burial was dated to 23,680±200 BP by a single AMS radiocarbon date from a rib fragment (OxA-8293) (Pettitt and Trinkaus 2000). If reliable, this date suggests that the burial is younger than the major Pavlovian settlement sites in the region. However, the conditions of excavation introduce the possibility that this single sample might have been contaminated, thus potentially yielding a radiocarbon date that is too young. Because of these reservations about the chronological attribution of this burial, and because of its general geographic proximity to the settlement sites, the artifacts from this burial were included in analyses conducted for this research. Many aspects of the Pavlovian archaeological record have drawn scholarly attention. Hypotheses about social networks in the region (Gamble 1991, 1999: 387 414), strategic hunting practices that might have included mammoth exploitation (Musil 1994, 1997, 2003), the earliest evidence of ceramics and textiles (Adovasio et al. 1996, Soffer et al. 2000; Vandiver et al. 1989), and semi-sedentism and periodic site or regional reoccupation (Svoboda 2003: 121-3; Svoboda et al. 1996: &lt;£ Springer</page><page sequence="6">130 Farbstein 135) have all been posed for Pavlovian culture. A wide range of stone tools, including microblades, scrapers, and burins, have been found at the sites, alongside points, scrapers, "spatulas," and "spoons" made in antler, bone, and ivory (Briihl 2005; Svoboda et al. 1996: 138-141). Importantly, Pavlovian craftspeople produced a large and diverse assemblage of portable art and figurines. Among these objects are the hundreds of figurative and non-figurative handheld artifacts that preserve on their surface a range of decorative and figurative incisions, which will be studied closely here. Research on Pavlovian art has typically referred to all intentional marks on the surface of a material as engravings (see Garcia Diez 2005). This general classification may overlook distinct modes of manufacture, different production choices and traditions, and varying gestures that were involved in the production of these surface incisions and embellishments. Furthermore, as these surface embel lishments may have been the final stage in the production, or chaine operatoire, of an artifact, it is essential to contextualize these embellishments and techniques against the suite of other decisions underlying the production of art. Considering the relationship between these final surface marks and earlier production choices, like raw material selection or modification, offers insight into the priorities and traditions of Paleolithic artists at work. Methodology This paper focuses on 566 objects of Pavlovian figurative and non-figurative art excavated from the major sites of DV I and DV II, Pavlov I and II, and Predmosti, as well as the isolated Brno II burial. Pavlovian art objects were made in one of seven raw materials: animal bone, ivory, antler, soft stone, hematite, tooth, and "ceramic" (see Tables 1 and 2). The art objects range greatly in their form and types of depictions. Numerous zoomorphic figurines made in both ivory and ceramic were found at the sites of Pavlov I, DV I, and Predmosti, including the flat ivory lion and mammoth statuettes (Fig. 4) called Reliefplastik (Klima 1963). Pavlovian anthropo morphic figurines include the famous Venus of DV I, the engraved "Venus" from Predmosti, and the three-part ivory "marionette" from Brno II. Non-figurative art is a larger and perhaps more diverse sub-assemblage of Pavlovian art. Non-figurative art includes simple linear incisions on bone, antler, and ivory (Fig. 5); complex carved ivory artifacts from Pavlov I and Predmosti (Fig. 1); decorated disks from Brno II; and the perforated and decorated ivory "diadems" from the site of Pavlov I, which feature patterned and geometric incisions and which have been interpreted as headbands or ornaments (Figs. 2 and 3). These artifacts were analyzed quantitatively by recording the presence or absence of almost 100 distinct technical and stylistic characteristics. During data collection, each characteristic, such as subject matter, material, or type of surface incision, was recorded independently, and relationships between traits were not assumed. This made it possible to trace the separate occurrence of each characteristic. These characteristics were subsequently compared across the entire assemblage (both at individual sites and between them) in order to identify any co-variances between technical, material, and aesthetic traits. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 131 Table 1 Number of Pavlovian Art Objects Made in Each Raw Material Raw material Number of artifacts Ivory 295 Ceramic 155 Reindeer antler 46 Bone 40 Soft stone 25 Tooth 4 Hematite 1 TOTAL 566 The surface markings described in this paper were among the traits studied on each artifact. As the aim of this research was to distinguish broad-scale similarities and differences in the techniques and gestures employed to mark the surface of Pavlovian art objects, macroscopic analysis was the predominant focus. These observations were supplemented by use of a x 10 hand lens to facilitate better identification of the gestures and strokes used to make surface incisions. The hand lens also made it possible to distinguish the variability in gestures used to produce marks across a range of raw materials. However, more detailed microscopic analysis of these objects and marks would be a valuable extension of the research reported here. Several aspects of this methodology depart from traditional analyses of Pavlovian art, and more generally Paleolithic art, which thus far have tended to focus on overall morphology and "style." Importantly, the full range of raw materials in each assemblage was studied, and art objects made in different raw materials were compared to each other, rather than being studied in isolation. This approach differs from previous analyses of ceramics, bone, or ivory art conducted separately from the overall assemblage of art (see Garcia Diez 2005; Klima 1997; Soffer and Vandiver 1994, 1997, 2005). Additionally, figurative and non-figurative art were studied alongside each other, thus reuniting a single assemblage of artifacts that are often segregated under different research programs (see Garcia Diez 2005; Valoch 1975; Verpoorte 2001). Thorough comparison of art made in several different materials is an essential component of this research. Individual craftspeople may have worked with numerous Table 2 Number of Art Objects Studied from Each Pavlovian Site in Moravia Site name Number of art objects DV I 110 DV II 18 Pavlov I 364 Pavlov II 7 Pfedmosti 50 Brno II 17 TOTAL 566 Springer</page><page sequence="8">132 Farbstein Fig. 5 Bone non-figurative art object from Pavlov I featuring surface engravings. The relatively thin and shallow lines were made by a single pass across the surface of the material different raw materials, so it is necessary to comprehensively study the full suite of technological behaviors and practices adopted by craftspeople working in different social contexts. Modern typological categories and classifications may not have been acknowledged or upheld by Pavlovian craftspeople, so comparing all classes of symbolic material culture is a necessary foundation for recovering prehistoric decision-making (see similar sentiments in Dobres 2010). Quantifying this range of technological choices using the chaine operatoire methodology described above allows deeper understanding of individual preferences and group priorities. Comparing technological choices related to art production across the Pavlovian social landscape develops and expands upon past research into the Pavlovian archaeological culture. Many scholars have worked to clarify the similarities and differences between groups occupying various parts of the Moravian landscape (see Soffer 2000; Svoboda 2003; Svoboda et al. 1996, 2000). Comparing the ways artists created symbolic material culture is a valuable addition to previous research focused on stone tool technologies and typologies, hunting strategies, and artistic styles. The flexible chaine operatoire methodology used in this paper facilitates a contextualized, comparative, and thorough understanding of how Paleolithic craftspeople engaged with a range of materials to make symbolic material culture in similar or different ways. Engraving Two distinct gestural techniques for marking the surface of both figurative and non figurative art were identified across the 566 Pavlovian art objects studied. The first type of incision is characterized by thin marks executed with just a few stokes of a tool across a surface (Fig. 5). The tool passes over the material in a single plane and leaves a shallow and narrow mark. It does not greatly modify the contours of the raw Springer</page><page sequence="9">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 133 material when viewed in cross-section. In this paper, these marks are called engravings. Both V- and U-shaped engravings were identified in non-figurative art from the Pavlov I site (Garcia Diez 2005), suggesting at least two different classes of stone tools were used for this task. Pavlovian tools used to incise organic materials might have been stone blades or burins that could produce a precise mark on ivory, antler, or bone. More detailed analysis of engravings in other Paleolithic contexts confirms the use of burins to make surface engravings (see Fritz 1999a, b). Stylistically, engravings were not always patterned or repetitive, but they sometimes appear to modern viewers as a cluster of marks without a clear motif. Indeed, a wide range of engravings was made using this gesture, including small and precise marks and patterns, messy scratches, and scribbles without a discernable structure or pattern, and long curvilinear incisions. Importantly, both macroscopically and under the *10 magnification of a hand lens, engravings are distinguishable from the striations that result from preparatory, but non-decorative scraping across a piece of ivory, antler, or bone (see Fig. 9). Carving A second technique of surface incision was differentiated from engraving and is classified here as "carving." This technique has not previously been distinguished as a separate mode of manufacture, but the physical, gestural, and aesthetic differences between this technique and engraving, as discussed above, are substantial. Pavlovian artists executed carving by making repeated motions across the surface, which eventually removed enough material to create a wide and deep scar (Fig. 2 and 3). When viewed in cross-section, it is clear that carving creates substantial disruptions in the surface of the support, implying that Pavlovian artists applied considerable pressure in order to create these incisions. As noted with engravings, both V- and U shaped cross-sections were identified. Although the same types of lithics may have been used for carving and engraving, in terms of the physical action of manufacture, carving and engraving result from different socio-technical practices, bodily move ments, and learned gestures (following Mauss 1935). Furthermore, engraving and carving are the result of distinct modes of engagement with a raw material and suggest different conceptions of how the finished embellishment should appear. Aesthetically, carving creates a very different effect from engraving. The bolder, deeper marks attract visual attention and, in the Pavlovian art assemblages, seem to emphasize the geometric and structured patterns found on many different and well-known artifacts (which will be discussed in detail below). Furthermore, in some instances, deep carving created a textural effect of relief, which might have impacted the physical and tactile engagement Pavlovian people had with these objects (Figs. 2 and 3). Pavlovian Regional Adoption of Carving and Engraving Engravings were identified on at least one piece of art from every site studied and in total was identified on 284 artifacts across the Pavlovian art assemblage. However, the deeper carving technique was not ubiquitous at Pavlovian sites in Moravia. Springer</page><page sequence="10">134 Farbstein ^ Pfedmosti •.

Carving was not noted at any other Pavlovian site with art studied for this research (Fig. 7). This use of the carving technique at only a small number of Pavlovian sites reveals its limited scope in this archaeological culture.

Although it is possible that post-depositional or taphonomic factors could effect the number of carved artifacts that were found during excavations at DV I and Brno II compared to those found at Pavlov I, the large discrepancy between 72 artifacts and only one or two makes this possibility seem unlikely. Carved artifacts would not have been inherently more likely to be destroyed or simply overlooked during excavation. In fact, the bold, deep lines produced by carving might have made these pieces more immediately identifiable to excavators in the field. Indeed, the smaller number of Pavlovian carved art objects seems to indicate that carving was a rare socio-technical practice that was only widely adopted at Pavlov I. Relating Surface Embellishments to Other Characteristics of Art The methodology adopted for this research enabled consideration of a range of potential relationships between chosen production sequences and characteristics of Pavlovian art. One of the most significant relationships identified was between choice of raw material and incision technique. At Pavlov I, the site with the greatest proportion of carved art objects, both engraving and carving were primarily associated with organic raw materials: bone, antler, and ivory. Ceramic artifacts were much less frequently incised on the surface (Table 3). This relationship between the choice of engraving or carving and the use of organic raw materials is echoed at DV I (Table 4). Only one ceramic figurine was found at both Predmosti and at DV II, so a patterned relationship between surface marking and the use of ceramic raw material could not be identified at these sites. The tendency at Pavlov I and DV I to engrave or carve the surfaces of organic materials more frequently than ceramic objects seems unrelated to the relative ease of working these materials. Soft ceramics would have been more easily engraved or carved than ivory, bone, and antler, yet it was not deeply incised. Fresh ivory,2 in particular, is incredibly brittle and difficult to modify (see observations in White 1997), yet this physical characteristic apparently did not restrict artists working at Pavlov I and DV I. These patterned relationships between raw material choice and techniques of surface embellishment at Pavlov I are further illustrated when focusing on carved artifacts. Carving closely correlates with the use of ivory, although isolated examples of carving on other raw materials suggests knowledge of and occasional experimentation with this technique when making art in other organic materials (Table 5). Indeed, these habitual choices suggest the development of socially ingrained practices that may have influenced the choice of particular techniques on certain raw materials. Distinguishing between figurative and non-figurative art in the overall assemblage at Pavlov I reveals that every carved artifact was non-figurative, suggesting a meaningful socio-technical association of carving and non representational art at this site. Consequently, carving was not only limited in its scope across Pavlovian sites and to certain raw materials. It was also restricted in its 2 It can be inferred that sub-fossil ivory was probably not habitually collected from the landscape or permafrost, given the large quantities of mammoth remains found at many Pavlovian sites. (See Musil (1994, 1997, 2005)). While it remains unclear whether mammoths were systematically hunted by Pavlovian groups, there does seem to be convincing evidence that Pavlovian societies were interested in mammoth bones and tusks (see more discussion in Oliva 2003).

Further, engraving and carving at Pavlov I were infrequently noted on the same artifact and therefore seem to have been conceived of broadly as different socio-technical traditions. This co-variance analysis of techniques and choice of raw material demonstrates how the gestures associated with carving and engraving were primarily conceived of and executed in socially distinct ways. Carving was socio-technically restricted to certain raw materials (primarily ivory), to certain locales (primarily Pavlov I), and to certain classes of art (non-figurative). This restricted co-variance likely does not relate strictly to a technological limitation of skill. It also does not seem to stem from using the more labor-intensive carving technique for "simpler" patterns, as it was habitually used to carve elaborate designs in ivory diadems (discussed in more depth below). Rather, these data suggest the development of a socially circumscribed tradition that associated particular gestures, marks, and resulting aesthetics with certain raw materials and certain classes of artifact. The stylistic and technical divide between engraving and carving suggests that Pavlovian artists habitually distin guished between these gestures and the style of mark they would produce. There are a small number of artifacts that were both engraved and carved, indicating some co variance of the techniques. However, carving seems to have been a new and innovative technology in the Pavlovian, and it might be expected that some artists experimented with this technique and its use on certain types of artifacts while new social norms for its use were established (see discussions of how groups adopt and accept innovations in Barnett 1953: 291-293).

Orientation and Placement Other technological and aesthetic traits associated with engravings and carvings are worth consideration. The significance of the placement of Pavlovian engravings and carvings in relation to the shape and configuration of the support or raw material has not been comprehensively evaluated before. Although non-figurative art from Pavlov I (Garcia Diez 2005; Klima 1997) and Predmosti (Valoch 1975) has been closely studied, the orientation and placement of surface markings as an aspect of technological style and choice has not been explored. Yet, there may be a direct correlation between the orientation and placement of engraving or carving and the overall technological style observed at each occupation site (following Lechtman 1977; Lemonnier 1993). The orientation and placement of an engraving or carving has a tangible effect on the way viewers engage with a piece of portable figurative or non-figurative art. These choices can both define the aesthetic character of a piece and direct the viewer's attention. Incisions and markings placed relatively equally on all surfaces of an object suggest that the artist engaged with the artifact three-dimensionally, perhaps without demarcating a clear "front" and "back." This three-dimensional engagement would have extended throughout the life history of the object, including both production and use. Markings found on many surfaces of a single piece allow us to imagine the way an artist would have turned the object in his or her hand during production. In contrast, engravings and carvings concentrated on only one surface define a privileged and intended viewpoint and may encourage viewers to focus on only the adorned surface. Thus, studying the orientation and placement of engravings and carvings can offer clues about how raw materials were engaged with, how certain technical practices were enacted by Pavlovian artists, and how these choices impacted the way art objects were "read" or perceived by Pavlovian audiences. The placement of engravings or carvings on Pavlovian art was classified for this research based on the presence or absence of marks on particular surfaces. Engraving Springer</page><page sequence="14">138 Farbstein or carving was identified as unifacial when marks were only noted on one surface. This first category (I) was also occasionally assigned if markings elsewhere on the artifact were minimal or so different in character from those on the main decorated surface that they were considered unrelated to the main decorative schema. For example, a mammoth rib at Predmosti was elaborately decorated with patterned engravings covering one entire surface of the artifact, while the reverse surface was totally devoid of decoration except for five small, parallel hatch marks engraved near one edge. It seems reasonable to postulate that these marks were not related to the patterned set on the obverse surface, which command most of the visual attention and focus. Furthermore, the time invested in producing these hatch marks on the reverse surface would have been minimal compared to the time invested in producing those on the obverse surface, indicating differential engagement with these two surfaces during manufacture. In a second category (II), engraving or carving was labeled bifacial when two surfaces, often opposite each other, were incised to a similar extent, although not necessarily with the same pattern, while the other surfaces were left unadorned. This orientation and placement of marks gives the impression that the artifact has a front and back. In the third type (III), engraving or carving was classified as multi-facial if three or more surfaces were incised to a similar extent. Exploring the orientation and placement of non-figurative engravings and carvings on a variety of raw material supports of different sizes and shapes illuminates new characteristics of the assemblages. If a specific placement of engravings or carvings was preferred at a site, regardless of the raw material or modification sequence employed, this may indicate a socio-technical preference and a normative production aesthetic. However, if the orientation and placement of incisions correlates to certain raw material choices, to the natural morphology of the raw material, or to the imposed shape of the object, then one of the artist's primary concerns might have been sensitivity to the natural form of the chosen raw material. In this case, the meaning or significance of these incisions and their specific placement on an art object may have been intimately related to the cultural significance given to the material, its natural shape, or the depiction produced. The following section will explore these potential relationships between the character istics and placement of engravings or carvings, earlier stages of the chaine operatoire such as raw material selection and initial modification, and the ultimate social meanings and use of a finished piece of art. The Placement of Engravings and Carvings on Pavlovian Ivory Art Ivory art from Pavlov I offers a compelling record of a clear association between raw material choice, sequences of material modification, and surface engravings and carvings. The orientation and placement of engravings and carvings on ivory objects seem to relate closely to the initial technique of material modification. Some Pavlovian art was made by sculpting a piece of ivory three-dimensionally and in the round (see Fig. 1). At Pavlov I, this manufacturing technique was noted in 49 of the 220 pieces of ivory art. Many of these three-dimensional artifacts feature surface engravings or carvings in a variety of locations, including on all sides. This suggests Springer</page><page sequence="15">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 139 that the artifact was conceived as a rounded three-dimensional object. The rounded morphology of the object, which resulted from the way ivory was sculpted during initial phases of production, would have been reinforced when engravings were made on all sides later in the object's chaine operatoire. In this instance, the incisions might have directed attention to the three-dimensional form of the artifact. In contrast, other ivory objects at the Pavlov I site were sculpted using technique directly related to the natural structure of mammoth tusks, which form in concentric rings or bands of ivory called lamellae. Although "fresh" ivory is difficult to work with, lamellae may be wedged or flaked apart into individual pieces on a partially desiccated tusk as the cementum that binds lamellae deteriorates (White 1997). Lamellae were identified as the foundational raw material for art in 170 instances at the site of Pavlov I (see Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Carvings and engravings on these artifacts were most frequently executed on a single face of the lamella, or, much less frequently, bifacially on the front and back of the lamella. This placement of engravings seems to have been influenced by the flat natural morphology of lamellae and by the apparent presence of primary and secondary surfaces. Uni- and bifacial engravings suggest a more two-dimensional conception of and engagement with the object. Indeed, Pavlovian techniques of incision and related technical choices were closely tied to, although not necessarily dictated by, material choices and a sensitive engagement with each individual raw material. Because these tendencies transcend figurative and non-figurative art, they seem to relate more to a habitual engagement with these materials at this site, rather than a specific stylistic agenda or a concern related to the depiction of certain subjects. A Specific Case Study: The Diadems from Pavlov I Ivory lamellae have one naturally slightly convex, arc-shaped surface, which results from their growth as ring-like structures in mammoth tusks (White 1997). Analysis of the 170 art objects made on ivory lamellae from Pavlov I finds that 143 of these were engraved or carved. Ninety seven of these carved or engraved artifacts were personally studied for this analysis, and all preserved an identifiable convex surface. Significantly, the orientation and placement of engravings and carvings on these objects, commonly called diadems, is highly patterned. Ninety three of the 97 decorated lamellae were engraved or carved on only the convex surface of the material (Fig. 8). Only four objects had engravings concentrated on the concave surface. Importantly, this very strong preference not just for unifacial carving and engraving but also for incising the convex surface of ivory lamellae is a pattern occurring in both figurative and non-figurative art. These trends support the hypothesis that these traditions were not necessarily related to the depiction of particular subjects. For example, the famous silhouette mammoth figurine (Fig. 4) from Pavlov I features engravings on the convex surface that indicate the separation of the animal's legs. The many diadems from the site (Figs. 2 and 3) that feature non-figurative or geometric decorations demonstrate that this tradition applied to non-figurative art as well. As both sides of the ivory would have the potential for being engraved or carved, several possible explanations for this technological tradition at Pavlov I must be •£) Springer</page><page sequence="16">140 Farbstein Engraving Location on Ivory Lamellae at Pavlov I Fig. 8 Graph illustrating the placement of decorative carvings and engravings from Pavlov I, in relation to natural convexity and concavity of ivory lamella considered. A strictly techno-functional explanation might propose that these lamellae were engraved while still part of an intact tusk and only unintentionally or naturally flaked apart after production or after discard and deposition. If true, this relationship might thus be taphonomic rather than indicate a technological choice. Several artifacts refute this hypothesis. Perforated diadems made from lamellae indicate that they were separated from the tusk before they could have been perforated. Additionally, most of the non-figurative decorated lamellae studied exhibit some shaping of their contours into an imposed form, as do figurative sculptures made on lamellae. This would have been impossible while the lamella was still attached to the tusk. Further, while decorative engraving and carving was concentrated on the convex surface, the concave side sometimes preserves scrape marks, which might have been made to reinforce the curvature of the piece or to smooth the underside after separation (see Fig. 9). The distinctly different character of these scrape marks on the reverse side and the carved and engraved patterns on Fig. 9 Reverse, concave surface of a perforated ivory diadem from Pavlov I. The parallel striations resulting from smoothing and scraping with stone tools are visible across this surface. Scale is in centimeters Springer</page><page sequence="17">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 141 the obverse surface further reinforces the argument that different gestures and actions were used to modify the two surfaces of lamellae in the production of diadems. Artists at Pavlov I clearly perceived, engaged with, and modified the two faces in vastly different ways. Another alternative explanation might propose that lamellae were engraved while still attached to the tusk and later intentionally separated and shaped into diadems or figurines. However, this illogical order of operations for the chaine operatoire also seems unlikely. It would be risky to complete the engravings or carvings before successfully accomplishing the difficult task of separating lamellae from the tusk core via levering or flaking. The process of separating lamellae from the mammoth tusk (see White 1997) might have resulted in unpredictable breakage patterns, possibly bisecting any engraving already completed. Even if this sequence had been adopted, the concave side of the lamellae could have subsequently been engraved or carved after separation, yet such bifacial embellishment is very infrequent at Pavlov I. Thus, it seems likely that engraving and carving were executed after lamellae were separated and sculpted into shape, and probably after any desired perforation that would also have risked damage to the piece. Moreover, the decorative patterns apparent on many diadems show sensitivity to the contours and shapes of the diadem. In some cases, the arcs of the carved decorative lines echo the imposed morphology of the diadem, which would have only existed after the lamellae was flaked apart and subsequently smoothed into shape (see Fig. 3). It is clear that Pavlovian artists habitually chose not to decorate both the convex and the concave surfaces of ivory lamellae. This choice probably relates to a local Pavlovian socio-technical tradition that related to the use of lamellae but transcended different "classes" of art objects. This strong tendency at Pavlov I appears to be a socially prescribed technological style (following Lechtman 1977) rather than the unintentional result of taphonomic processes or the production sequence. Further more, there is nothing inherent about the shape or physical characteristics of lamellae that would discourage artists from engraving or carving the concave surface. Ivory does not have the spongy, cancellous interior tissue of bone, and the concave surface of ivory lamellae does not have a different texture from the convex surface. Decorating the convex surface simply was not part of the socio-technical repertoire practiced at this site. The unifacial embellishment of diadems might correspond to their purported use as personal ornaments, where the visible (convex) side would be decorated while the hidden (concave) surface was left unmarked. As these objects might have been attached to some sort of perishable strap, the convex side would be the most natural "external" surface, as any bending imposed when the object was worn would correspond with the natural curvature of the raw material. Artifacts not identified as diadems but featuring the same unifacial decorative tendency, for instance the Reliefplastik figurines, may ascribe to this same technological style for other reasons. One possible explanation for the widespread decoration of convex surfaces at Pavlov I posits a more cognitive origin for this socio-technological behavior. Artists were knowledgeable about the structure of tusks and would have known that the convex surface of lamellae corresponded to the outside of a complete tusk. Perhaps the decoration of the convex, external surface of separated lamellae represents a cognitive link to the natural form of the tusk. Artists may have remained cognizant Springer</page><page sequence="18">142 Farbstein of the original structure of the tusk and the source of the raw material even after segmenting it into component lamellae. If this attribution of the convex surface to the "outside" of the tusk persisted during production, it would be counter-intuitive to decorate what was perceived as the "inside" of the tusks. Similar choices are apparent in the Pavlovian art traditions of working with other materials. For instance, artists at the site of Pavlov I showed sensitivity towards the natural shape of many animal bones, choosing to preserve their configuration in the production of art. They also preserved these natural bone morphologies when making bone points and awls (see Briihl 2005). In accordance with this habitual technological style, modifying ivory in a way that reminded the artist of the material's raw form would not be unusual or surprising. Verpoorte (2001: 105-106) noted the ways Pavlovian artists used natural ivory contours to highlight the dimensionality of their figurative art, but close analysis of the non-figurative assemblage demonstrates that this tendency extended across the entire assemblage and may have physical, material, cognitive, and technological foundations. Implications for Pavlovian Art and Society This research into Pavlovian art technologies has confirmed the presence of some uniformity of production or technological style across some classes of symbolic material culture. On a macroscale, archaeologists have long acknowledged the many components of the Pavlovian archaeological record that suggest cultural similarities. Lithic acquisition strategies privileging exotic raw materials, episodic reoccupation of specific sites in the landscape, complex and multi-personal burials, and exploitation of mammoth remains all suggest some broad cultural continuity across Pavlovian-aged sites in Moravia. The association of carving and engraving with organic materials like ivory, antler, and bone, and the less frequent incision of ceramic at the Pavlovian sites studied seems to be another broad socio-technical tradition shared across the Pavlovian landscape. These data seem to support hypotheses that there was some socio-cultural uniformity across settlement sites in this region. However, other, more nuanced differences discovered in the art assemblages reveal more diversity between nearby occupation sites than has previously been discussed. Carving, a technique not previously discussed in the literature, appears to have had limited socio-technical scope as it was identified primarily at Pavlov I and in association with non-figurative ivory objects. This carving technique may be interpreted as a local innovation that emerged alongside the production of ivory art at the site of Pavlov I. It seems to have been associated not just with ivory non figurative art but also with the habitual unifacial decoration of convex surfaces at this site. The limited geographic distribution of the carving technique suggests that the social knowledge and adoption of these practices was circumscribed and limited not just to certain raw materials but also to specific occupation sites within the Pavlovian. Due to its limited scope in this cultural context, it may be interpreted as a small-scale technological innovation that developed into a technological style (following Lechtman 1977) at the site of Pavlov I, but was not widely shared or Spring er</page><page sequence="19">Social Gestures and Technologies in Paleolithic Art 143 adopted across the overall Pavlovian technocomplex. It is especially noteworthy that carving was abundant at Pavlov I but was virtually absent in the ivory art assemblage from the nearby and similarly dated site of DV I. That artists working at these two sites did not share this technique suggests more social, technological, and artistic diversity and division than has often been hypothesized on the basis of lithic analyses, settlement patterns, and other shared innovative technologies like ceramics (see Svoboda et al. 1996, 2000; Verpoorte 2001). Following Lechtman (1977) and Lemonnier (1993), the presence of a local and small-scale technological style, such as unifacial carving, supports the notion that Pavlovian artists working at different locales and in different social contexts probably learned how to enact some tasks and gestures in very different ways and for possibly different socio-aesthetic reasons. Recalling Mauss' arguments about techniques du corps, these data suggest that artists at Pavlov I and at DV I did not share all of the same suites of technical gestures or related social behaviors. These observations can also be considered in light of more recent publications that have attempted to distinguish social "boundaries" in the archaeological record (see contributions to Stark 1998; Stark et al. 2008). Following these publications, it does seem that a socio-technical boundary related to ivory modification and carving technologies existed between the groups that occupied DV I and Pavlov I. Conclusions This article has introduced, quantified, and compared several important character istics of Paleolithic mark making that have not been previously considered. This analysis traced the social, geographic, and technical distribution of two techniques of embellishment. Results indicate the emergence of geographically circumscribed and small-scale socio-technical traditions and innovations such as ivory carving. Although artists employing this innovative technique abided by similar practices, gestures, and norms, it was not widely shared across the Pavlovian social landscape. The limited adoption and spread of this innovation primarily at the site of Pavlov I suggests more variability in Pavlovian social relations, technological preferences, and art traditions than is often discussed. The socio-technical preferences and patterns revealed through this analysis also highlight the need for more quantitative, comprehensive, and comparative methodologies for studying Paleolithic art. The similarities and differences demonstrated between figurative and non-figurative art in the analyses described above, and the data quantifying the relationship between material choices and techniques of embellishment, lead to new observations about the cultural significance of these practices within the Paleolithic. These fine-scaled artistic preferences and the variability exposed in this research are not recoverable using traditional methodologies that focus on a single "class" of artifacts or that study only select, particularly evocative objects of representational art. Socio-technical practices are only exposed through a comprehensive assessment of the suite of materials, technologies, and gestures employed in the production of material culture. A material-based chaine operatoire approach such as the one advanced here has the potential to clarify the socially variable nature of art production in the Paleolithic. Springer</page><page sequence="20">144 Farbstein Using this methodology can help advance our understanding of how artists imparted meaning to their society through technological choices, gestures, and traditions of art production.
