<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ZEITGEIST OF MATTHEW ARNOLD By Fraser Neiman AT LEAST since Matthew Arnold exploited the term Zeitgeist in Literature and Dogma, the expression has been variously a source of irritation and confusion to a number of his critics. Identifying it with a tendency to disparage the past, an exasperated contemporary reviewer of that work in Blackwoodys Edinburgh Magazine cried, "Can anything be more unscientific than such a spirit? It is the very apotheosis of self- opinion intoxicated by its own pride, and flaunting its own dogmatisms with a crude audacity in the face of preceding dogmas." Among other critics of Arnold, R. H. Hutton protested that the Zeitgeist was a will- o'-the-wisp "who misleads us at least as much as he enlightens"; W. H. Dawson concluded that for Arnold it was "a fetish, a talisman, a thau- maturgy"; for W. H. Paul it became a bore; Hugh Kingsmill began his caricature of Don Matthew, "So forth he sallied, mounted on Zeit-Geist, a hobby horse." Still others, less annoyed than these by the reiteration, have themselves borrowed it as they write of him?sometimes effec- tively, because with consistency of meaning, as H. F. Lowry in his edition of Arnold's letters to Clough; sometimes bewilderingly, as when one reads such a statement as this: "Expediency, which had become in Burke's hands an anti-revolutionary doctrine, was equated by Arnold with the Zeitgeist, a force which, in his conception of it, was quite as revolutionary as that of natural right."1 Recourse to a dictionary will not solve the problem of Arnold's mean? ing. The sole and neutral definition of Zeitgeist, for example, that the New English Dictionary provides, "the spirit or genius which marks the thought or feeling of a period or age," is inadequate to express the meta? physical suggestions that Arnold's context frequently stimulates.2 The very passage that is cited to support this definition exposes its limitations; for when Arnold wrote in 1873, "it is what we call the Time-Spirit which is sapping the proof from miracles, it is the 'Zeit-Geist' itself," he en- dowed the term with a demonic force, with an irresistibility influential for his case, absent from the definition. The dynamic activity of the verb 1 "Amateur Theology," cxm (June 1873), 692; Essays on Some of the Modern Guides of English Thought in Matters of Faith (London, 1887), p. 103; Matthew Arnold and His Relation to the Thought of Our Time (New York, 1904), p. 174; Matthew Arnold (London, 1902), p. 142; Matthew Arnold (New York, 1928), p. 263; W. F. Connell, The Educational Thought and Infiuence of Matthew Arnold (London, 1950), p. 82. 2 A New English Dictionary erroneously gives 1893 for 1873 as the date of Literature and Dogma. The error is by implication perpetuated in the Supplement (1933) of the N.E.D. where an "earlier" use of Zeitgeist is cited from "Recent Fiction in England and France," Macmillan's Mag., l (Aug. 1884), 254. 977</page><page sequence="2">978 The Zeitgeist of Matthew Arnold "is sapping," and the selfhood of the Time-Spirit stir the expression to livelier meaning than is conveyed by more commonplace phrases like "the spirit of the time" or "the spirit of the age." Arnold himself was content, as every reader knows, to use terms? "the grand style," "stream," "tendency," "the Eternal not ourselves"? as though in his Olympian discourse they had clear definitions and single meanings, leaving the reader to resolve the ambiguities; and he was fond of Homer's saying, "Wide is the range of words! words may make this way and that." Perhaps if they made "this way," and if by their sug- gestiveness to the mind and the emotions they lent persuasiveness to the rhetoric, his end was accomplished; but if they made "that"?as F. H. Bradley so devastatingly remarked, "we concluded that for us once again the light had shone in darkness."3 Yet Arnold's intention was not to mislead, although lack of defmition may have been a means of avoiding commitment. Without pretending to be a philosopher, that is, as he used the term, an originator of ideas, Arnold did put into circulation thoughts and expressions that he created or to which, like "Philistine" or "culture," he gave a special character and currency. The Zeitgeist is among these; its appearance in his work is frequent enough to be signifi? cant; its ambiguities invite scrutiny. The object of this paper is to examine how Arnold used the figure and to determine what meanings it had for him. The phenomenon of time, periodicity in history, the doctrine of devel? opment, the relation of the individual to the age in which he finds him? self and to the age to which he imagines some greater affinity, are inter? ests that are widely reflected in Arnold's writing. They may find ex? pression in metaphors like the "River of Time" or "wave" and "stream" and "tendency," or in more elaborate attempts to establish historic periods, such as the epoch of concentration and the epoch of expansion, that one meets in essays, poems, or letters. From the pessimistic allusion to Goethe's theory of spiral progress in a letter of 1848 to the penultimate entry from Karl Marx in the Note-Books for 1888, Arnold reveals an interest in the nature of historic process.4 The names of Hume, Herder, Hegel, Michelet, Renan, Baur, Reuss, to mention only a few, recur in the lists of reading, projected or completed, in his notebooks. Thucyd- ides, Burke, and Niebuhr are referred to as types of the scientific his? torian.5 The survey of political history in England and the Ltalian Ques- 3 Ethical Studies (London, 1876), p. 283. 4 The letters of Matthew Arnold to Arthur Hugh Clough, ed.

Indeed one recent critic is persuaded that Arnold's speculations concerning historical process "add up to a philosophy of history so impressive in its comprehensiveness and inner consistency that one wonders that students of Arnold have taken little notice of it."6 Although Arnold's interest is widely and vari- ously exhibited, I doubt both its comprehensiveness and its consistency. Arnold, who avoided committing himself to systems, although he was anxious to discover first principles, seems to have heeded his father's warning that one should observe "how little any real history is an exact exemplification of abstract principles."7 The movement of the River of Time in "The Future" reveals an Arnold divided between an idea of happiness conceived in terms of human social progress and an idea of happiness dependent upon intimate relations of the individual with some spiritual origin.8 The oratorical ending of A French Eton (1864) glows with a vision of the ascent of "the arduous ladder whereby man climbs toward his perfection"; but Arnold and the Scholar Gypsy of Thyrsis (1866) seek "a fugitive and gracious light" tentatively and in solitude.9 And the essays of the last decade suggest a diminished interest in historical process and causation. Yet Arnold's Time-Spirit is an evi? dence of his interest in the phenomenon of change. His meanings for it may throw some light on his interpretation of historical process. Like the operations of the Zeitgeist, neither Arnold's meanings for the figure nor his intentions in using it are constant. In particular, there appear to be two periods?that of the letters to Clough and that of the writings on Church and Bible?when Arnold favors the word. But a wide gulf separates the meanings. In the one period, Zeitgeist will, I think, be found to be the temper of the times, with the additional idea that time is a local, changeable phenomenon opposing eternal values; in the other, Zeitgeist is an aspect of the eternal, promoting change as a manifestation of its own being. The Zeitgeist first appears in a letter of 20 July 1848. "My dear Clough," Arnold writes with a characteristic air of negligence in refer? ence, "Goethe says somewhere that the Zeitgeist when he was young caused everyone to adopt the Wolfian theories about Homer, himself included; and that when he was in middle age the same Zeitgeist caused them to leave these theories for the hypothesis of one poem and one 6 Gaylord C.

The passage continues, alluding to the hero and heroine of Clough's Fragments of the Mystery of the Fall: "This view, as congenial to me as uncongenial, I suspect, to you, causes me, while I confess that productions like your Adam and Eve are not suited to me at present, yet to feel no confidence that they may not be quite right and calculated to suit others." The intention is mildly ironic, and despite, if not because of, the qualifying "not suited to me at present," the tone is mildly superior. Zeitgeist appears to mean current opinion, current intellectual fashion. The spirit itself operates, with a certain amount of whimsicality, in the realm of opinion. It is as if to say with Olivia's fool, "And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges." The implication is that Arnold can elect to avoid the pressure of local opinion, that he can find stability beyond the flux of fashion. Zeitgeist is an emblem of insecurity, but "whirligig" is far removed from the solemnities of Welt geschichte. Although Arnold introduces the Zeitgeist in conjunction with Goethe's name, he may equally well have met the word and found his early mean? ing for it in Carlyle, who had used it in "Characteristics" (1831) and in Sartor Resartus (1833-34). Carlylean vehemence certainly stirred Arnold when he next introduced it in a letter to Clough in November 1848. For 1848 is still within the period of Arnold's admiration for Carlyle, al? though Arnold labeled him a "moral desperado" in the fall of 1849 (Letters to Clough, p. 111). In March 1848 he sent his mother Carlyle's foaming article on Louis Philippe from the Examiner, with the significant final comment: "How deeply restful it comes upon one amidst the hot dizzy trash one reads about these changes everywhere. . . . The source of repose in Carlyle's article is that he alone puts aside the din and whirl and brutality which envelop a movement of the masses, to fix his thoughts on its ideal invisible character."10 More important, however, than the Carlylean vehemence of expres? sion in the letter to Clough, are the Carlylean ideas that Arnold rein- forced in the final clause, namely, that the Zeitgeist is escapable, there? fore local and temporary, and that it embodies transitory as against absolute values. Arnold writes: "I have been at Oxford the last two days and hearing Sellar and the rest of that clique who know neither life nor themselves rave about your poem gave me a strong almost bitter feeling with respect to them, the age, the poem, even you. Yes I said to myself something teils me I can, if need be, at least dispense with them all, even with him: better that, than be sucked for an hour even into the Time 10 Letters to Matthew Arnold, 1848-88, ed.

More English than European, I said finally, more American than English: and took up Obermann, and re- fuged myself with him in the forest against your Zeit Geist."11 The age, the Time Stream, the Zeitgeist are significantly interrelated. The Zeit? geist has meaning in the neutral sense of the spirit or temper of the age; it also has meaning in a sense more metaphysical than definition as "the thought or feeling of a period or an age" would imply. It is the character of the age, especially if one views that age as expressive of a process at odds with eternal values. The connotation of Zeitgeist in the letters to Clough is to be understood I think not in the context only of a letter, but of the letters, for the reiterated complaints of "unpoetical," of the "damned times," of the lack of nourishment, of the blankness and barren- ness, of the aridity of the age, constitute the character the Geist em- bodies. Allied with the image of the Charybdean Time Stream, it sug? gests more than this embodiment. The voracious Time Stream is the continuous process that subsumes the spirit of any particular time; against its surging if fruitless activity is the aloof and permanent, though sad, spiritual repose symbolized by Obermann's forest. That one's age is in some measure escapable, that the artist may preserve his integrity by turning "deeper in the bowering wood! / Averse, as Dido did, with gesture stern," in pursuit of universal values are ideas that Carlyle, like Arnold, applauded. Indeed Arnold comes closer here to common feeling with Carlyle than at any other point in his thought.12 The pattern of Arnold's thought may become clearer if compared with Carlyle's. Carlyle was puzzled by the phenomenon of time. He tended to regard it as illusory, or if he admitted it to the "quite undue rank of Realities," he thought of it as a force of negation to be overcome, like the dull dense mass on which Shelley's "plastic stress" operates, or, like Goethe's Mephistopheles, a spirit that denies.13 He reflects in Sartor Resartus: "Often have I fancied how, in thy hard life-battle, thou wert shot at, and slung at, wounded, hand-fettered, hamstrung, brow-beaten 11 Letters to Clough, p. 95. The descending scale, European-English-American, is implied also in Arnold's letter to his mother, 7 March 1848, in Works, xiii, 5-6. 12 If Arnold read Carlyle's "State of Modern Literature," Edinburgh Rev. (Oct. 1827), where the issues of time and historic process, including Fichte's interpretation, are ex- plored, he became aware of Schiller's congenial Uber die asthetische Erziehung des Menschen. Richard Waidelich in his unpub. diss. (Harvard, 1952), "The Theme of Change in Matthew Arnold's Poetry," discusses the place of this work of Schiller in Arnold's intellectual history. 13 Sartor Resartus, Works, Centenary ed.

Arnold, on the other hand, does not seem to have been perplexed, except in the poem "In Utrumque Paratus," by the possible ideality of his universe, but he was fully persuaded of the arid, dispiriting nature of his own day, and of his obligation to fasten on absolute ethical values, ascertainable through self-knowledge, fixed above the flux.14 In the letters to Clough the Zeitgeist expresses for Arnold a force to be abhorred, local, negative. On the other hand, a decade later, in the review "Dr. Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church" (1863), it com? mands respect; it begins to emerge as the agent of necessary change in the realm of intellect, a role that is established more firmly in St. Paul and Protestantism and yet more insistently and triumphantly asserted, for at least rhetorical ends, to strengthen Arnold's case in Literature and Dogma. The term that in 1848 expressed the dullness of the world to be overcome expresses in the 1860's the plastic stress itself. Approximately a decade also separates the melancholy conclusion to Arnold's view of progress in "The Future"?"But what was before us we know not, / And we know not what shall succeed"?and that glowingly hopeful prospect in A French Eton, of a later generation "mounting some new step in the arduous ladder whereby man climbs toward his perfec? tion." Although my object is not to trace the genesis of Arnold's think? ing, a word should be said to bridge the decade. Even in the earlier years of Arnold's maturity where data for the understanding of his personal and intellectual history is so meager, there exist evidences of his chang? ing historical awareness; if one cannot say categorically who shaped his thinking, or precisely when or in what way, one can yet discern influences and receptive attitudes that may well account for the strong modifying of the early pessimism, either because they suggested new modes of thinking or confirmed ideas he was himself working out. Not only the poem "The Future," but also "Revolutions" (1852) and the ironic "Progress" (1852) reflect an interest in historic process, dilemmas that must be resolved, and unyielding tenets with which Arnold must recon- cile any philosophy of change. "Revolutions" submits that civilizations 14 Carlyle reserved the phrase "the spirit of the age" to represent the Divine Idea mani- fest in the local phenomenon of time, whereas he used "Time-Spirit" to indicate the negative force of local appearance impeding man's awareness of the reality of the realm of spirit.

Arnold did not make such a distinction in terms.</page><page sequence="7">Fraser Neiman 983 ?Greece, Rome, England, France?have been the inadequate, and not final, eflorts of man to express a divine order, which exists in the mind of God, but which man is capable of realizing. "Progress" balances man's desire for the new dispensation in primitive Christian and modern times, and, belying what expectations the title might arouse of materialistic meaning, concludes, uThou must be born again!1 m The individualism which insists on man's creativity, the authority of conscience, which is the private and intuitive consciousness of a divine moral order, the prem- ise of individual moral regeneration as the condition of "progress" are Arnold's fundamental positions, and they are implicit here. They constitute the "bedrock credo," prior to any philosophy of history.16 These tenets are always supportable in the exclusive privacy of Ober- mann's forest; Arnold's problem was to find a reading of the history of humanity in society that could contain them, for his growing sense of public responsibility compelled him to accommodate a larger experience than that of the individual. Ideas about periodicity in history, about the role of Providence, ideas of history as revelation, of the nature of devel? opment were available to him severally or in conjunction in writings by men of whom he was aware by the early 1850's. Burke's fragmentary Essay towards an Abridgment of the English History combined rationalis- tic objectivity in narration with the admission of a providential ordering of change.17 Carlyle's eclecticism may well have provided Arnold with insight into the concept of revelation through history favored among the German transcendentalists.18 Niebuhr displayed a scientific method and asserted the action of Providence in events.19 Bunsen, the friend of Arnold's father, justified alteration in church matters as "development," and his " 'God in History' is," one of Arnold's early reviewers noted, "Arnold's God in human experience."20 John Henry Newman, whom 15 Poetical Works, p. 238.

Zeitgeist appears to have offered for a time the needed measure of potency and elusiveness. In a period when his agnosticism was waning, it afforded a device for intimating, without definite commitment, the concern of an intelligent, moral force in human activity. In his essay on Doctor Stanley's Lectures Arnold distinguishes between a world of purely intellectual life, which a few men?Parmenides, Spinoza, Hegel are his examples?inhabit, and the world of religious life, where strong feelings attach to certain fixed ethical ideas. The values of the latter world are absolute; the values of the former, operant in the areas of philosophy, science, letters, are mutable, though they are not mutable in a frivolous way. They accord with what now fascinates Ar? nold, a doctrine of development. "Intellectual ideas," he writes, "are not the essence of the religious life; still the religious life connects itself, as I have said, with certain intellectual ideas, and all intellectual ideas fol? low a development independent of the religious life."23 The term Zeit? geist gives Arnold a symbol for expressing mutability at the same time that it suggests an extramundane force ordering the change in accor- dance with some law. I do not perceive what form this law takes for Arnold except that reasonableness, that is, rationality, seems to increase in time, both in areas of enlightenment and in the numbers of persons enlightened; but with reference to infallible moral law Arnold would agree that like the law invoked by Antigone, it does not have its origin today or yesterday, but is from all time. As in the case of Arnold's initial reference to the Zeitgeist in the letters to Clough, Goethe is paraphrased to provide orientation for the word; 21 Unpublished Letters to Matthew Arnold, ed. Arnold Whitridge (New Haven, 1923), pp. 56, 65-66. 22 Lionel Trilling has shrewdly remarked in his Matthew Arnold (New York, 1949), p. 137, "Arnold shared the avid historical appetite of the 19th century which his father had helped to increase." Trilling's remarks passim on the Arnolds and history are valuable. Dr. Arnold's concept of history has been recently explored in Duncan Forbes's The Liberal Anglican Idea of History (see n. 19 above) and the unpub. diss. (Harvard, 1951) by Richard K. Barksdale, "Thomas Arnold as Historian." 23 "Dr. Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church," Macmillarfs Mag., vn (Feb. 1863), 333-334.</page><page sequence="9">Fraser Neiman 985 but whereas the Zeitgeist is there reported to have caused opinion to veer from the hypothesis of single to that of multiple authorship of the Homeric poems between Goethe's youth and middle age, it now moves with less undignified haste, taking a lifetime to effect the change. "Goethe somewhere remarks," says Arnold again, as he sympathizes with the intellectually awake yet pious clergyman in a time of rapidly increasing information, "how the Zeit-Geist, as he calls it, the Time-Spirit, irresistibly changes the ideas current in the world. When he was young, he says, the Time-Spirit had made every one disbelieve in the existence of a single Homer: when he was old, it was bearing every one to a belief in it" ("Dr. Stanley's Lectures . . . ," p. 334). How such fluctuation of opinion as this about single or multiple authorship illustrates the world of intellectual development that Parmenides, Spinoza, Hegel live in, is not clear. Yet Arnold has introduced a useful rhetorical term, and he continues immediately: "Intellectual ideas, which the majority of men take from the age in which they live, are the dominion of this Time- Spirit; not moral and spiritual life, which is original in each individual." Arnold could hardly have believed that ideas about authorship and philosophical ideas are of the same category, that the word is really used synonymously. Here his strategy has been to adduce, from one context, the authority lent by Goethe's name to witness, in another context, the pressure of a metaphysical force shaping the "development" of ecclesias? tical thought. The Zeitgeist is not now a force against which the artist must "refuge" himself. It has more validity than mere opinion. The majority are not reprehensible for taking their intellectual ideas from their age, for these ideas are under a "dominion" not their own; they are "liable to development and change" ("Dr. Stanley's Lectures . . . ," p. 334). The spirit operates, we are told, "irresistibly," outside the sphere of moral and religious ideas. Thus the Articles of the Church of England, reflecting the ideas of the English Reformers and the Reformation, de- serve review. "Insensibly the Time-Spirit brings to men's minds a con? sciousness that certain of these ideas have undergone such development, such change."24 Arnold who so habitually emphasized the role of the individual in the world of thought may in this essay seem?I think it is only seeming?to make him the instrumentality in a dialectical process. The greatness of the great religious reformer, he says at the beginning of the essay, "does not consist in his having these new ideas [that is, intellectual ideas], in 24 Ibid., p. 334. Cf. Arnold's proposition in "A Psychological Parallel," Last Essays on Church and Religion, Works, ix, 226: "That a man shares an error of the minds around him and of the times in which he lives, proves nothing against his being a man of veracity, judgment and mental power."</page><page sequence="10">986 The Zeitgeist of Matthew Arnold originating them. The ideas are in the world; they come originally from the sphere of pure thought; they are put into circulation by the spirit of the time. The greatness of a religious reformer consists in his reconciling them with the religious life, in his starting this life upon a fresh period in company with them" ("Dr. Stanley's Lectures . . . ," p. 334). The passage seems to me to be ambiguous at a critical point. What does Arnold mean by "the sphere of pure thought"? How do ideas "come" into the world? Does to "put into circulation" mean "to initiate" or "to stimulate"? Does the phrase "by the spirit of the time" mean by a transcendental force, or by the favorable state of popular knowledge at a given time? "Matthew Arnold the Epistemologist" has not been written; and the context does not answer all the questions. I think, however, that the passage is to be understood by the needs of his rhetoric and in the light of the role Arnold may have imagined for himself. Soon to attempt a career of religious reformer, he disclaims originality as a thinker; he sets up a category of "philosophers" to account for novelty in thought, and confines the role of religious thinker to the reinterpretation of the religious life in accordance with the current of rationalistic intellectual ideas. Similarly in the next year, in "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time" (1864), Arnold, continuing to devise uncomfortable categories, assigns to the creative literary genius the province of syn? thesis and exposition (Works, iii, 5). He is thus limiting the expectations of the reader of this essay who will follow his writing. Moreover, by in- voking "a spirit of the time" that inspires belief (for it draws its strength from the "sphere of pure thought"), he at once wears a face of modesty regarding the opinions promulgated and, whether the spirit is regarded as an occult power or as a favorable state of informed opinion, he is supported by a witness that it is difficult to controvert. The danger of constructing an epistemology or a rigid philosophy of history out of his metaphors is indicated by Arnold himself in the first essay on St. Paul and Protestantism when he says of St. Paul's use of figurative language: "He uses within the sphere of religious emotion ex? pressions which, in this sphere, have an eloquence and a propriety, but which are not to be taken out of it and made into formal scientific prop? ositions" (Works, ix, 27). His warning may reinforce the probability that the more limited meaning of the "spirit of the time" is nearer to Arnold's intention. But when he subsequently introduced into the essay on Stanley's Lectures the idea of a more dramatic Zeitgeist operating "irresistibly" and "insensibly" on men's consciousness in accordance with a doctrine of development, he emphasized the latent ontological im? plications, and heightened the anthropomorphic ones; and he found a</page><page sequence="11">Fraser Neiman 987 metaphorical ally to reinforce the argument in his first two books of religious controversy. "Man never knows how anthropomorphic he is," Arnold repeats after Goethe in Literature and Dogma.25 The tendency of critics and historians of Christian doctrine?Renan, Reuss, Baur, Strauss?with whom Arnold became increasingly familiar in the decade of the 1860's, and collaterally with the preparation of the major works on religious controversy, must have confirmed not only his own conviction that the importance of Christianity was in relation to human conduct, but also the optimism inherent in the concept of devel? opment in human enlightenment. Renan's conviction, expressed in Uavenir de la science, that amid its oscillations humanity tends through increasing rationality towards perfection, finds its echo in A French Eton. His proposition, "Le temps me semble de plus en plus le facteur universel, le grand coefficient de l'eternel 'devenir'," was profoundly congenial to Arnold. And Arnold shared the belief of fimile de Laveleye that the change in religious thought was "une evolution de doctrines tout in- terieure, qui, par le travail lent, continu, sans passions et sans bruit, de l'erudition, tend a modifier les traditions, les croyances, et en dernier resultat a eliminer le surnaturel."26 His own religious essays attempted to demonstrate the validity of this position. The two essays on St. Paul and Protestantism, which gave the title to the first of Arnold's books on religious issues, appeared initially in the Cornhill Magazine, October and November 1869. The third essay, "Puritanism and the Church of England," appeared in the issue for February 1870. In this last Arnold declares his doctrine of development, quoting Newman for its formulation: A historic Church cannot choose but allow the principle of development, for it is written in its institutions and history. An admirable writer, in a book which is one of his least known works, but which contains, perhaps, even a greater num? ber of profound and valuable ideas than any other one of them, has set forth, both persuasively and truly, the impression of this sort which Church-history cannot but convey. "We have to account," says Dr. Newman, in his Essay on Develop? ment, "for that apparent variation and growth of doctrine which embarrasses 25 Works, vn, 33. Arnold remarks in Literature and Dogma, p. 10: "Terms, in short, which with St. Paul are literary terms, theologians have employed as if they were scientific terms." Cf. also Arnold's comment in Culture and Anarchy, Works, vi, 151, that "terms which St. Paul employs ... are detached and employed by Puritanism, not in the con? nected and fluid way in which St. Paul employs them, and for which alone words are really meant, but in an isolated, fixed, mechanical way, as if they were talismans."

The increase and expansion of the Christian creed and ritual, and the variations which have attended the process in the case of individual writers and churches, are the neces? sary attendants on any philosophy or polity which takes possession of the in? tellect and heart, and has had any wide or extended dominion. FronMhe nature of the human mind, time is necessary for full comprehension and perfection of great ideas."27 A "principle of development," a "law of development," is a premise of Arnold's contention in this essay that the special tenets of Puritan dogma are intolerable foundations for Christian faith. And it is also a conten? tion that though Newman has seen and though Hooker and Butler have seen "the whole Bible is written on the principle of development," the Church has not yet provided an adequate vehicle for the interpretation and accommodation of current developments of thought and science. Moreover, the Catholic Church has "vainly imagined herself to have had the power to produce" the right philosophical developments (Works, ix, 144-145). What agency then does forward our ideas? Arnold's answer is that "their ripeness and unripeness, as Dr. Newman most truly says, are not an effect of our wishing or resolving. Rather do they seem brought about by a power such as Goethe figures by the Zeit-Geist or Time-Spirit, and St. Paul describes as a divine power revealing additions to what we possess already" (Works, ix, 144). Not only is the Zeitgeist here a differ? ent force from the abhorrent pressure of contemporaneity against which Arnold would "refuge" himself in 1848; it is more demonic than Goethe's figure, or even than the Zeitgeist of the review of Dr. Stanley's Lectures. Its operation, if vague in mode, is admittedly divine; time as historic process has ontological meaning. Yet one must qualify the representation of such a conception as a positive tenet in Arnold's creed by his own two reservations, "such as" and "do seem." Like the Demon, Ghost, and Heaven of Shelley's "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," the Zeitgeist is the record of an endeavor to express in words a process that the heart of mankind apprehends; like the grounds of Wordsworth's intimations of immortality, it may be "too shadowy a notion to be recommended to 27 Works, ix, 133-134. The Note-Books, p. 587, show that in 1870 Arnold read Milman's early hostile review, "Newman on the Development of Christian Doctrine," which was reprinted in that year in Savonarola, Erasmus, and Other Essays. In 1871 he began a brief and sympathetic correspondence with Newman (Unpublished letters, pp. 55-67). It might be noted in connection with Arnold's interest in a theory of development that the reading lists for 1868 and 1869 in his Note-Books, pp. 584, 586, include Herder's Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit. In 1868 he extracted for his reference (Note- Books, p. 85) F. W. Riemer's maxim that, "die Religion selbst, wie die Zeit, wie Leben und Wissen, in stetem Fortschritt und Fortbildung begriffen ist."</page><page sequence="13">Fraser Neiman 989 faith." But the force with which the reservations are stated seems minor compared to the potency of the rhetorical figure. When Arnold published St. Paul and Protestantism, he included a pre? face in which the image, originally introduced once and then late in the third paper, is reintroduced five times, and as a serious ground of the argument. "In the second place," says Arnold in that preface, implicitly disclaiming the role of philosopher as he defined it, "the version we pro- pound of St. Paul's line of thought is not new, is not of our discovering. It belongs to the 'Zeit-Geist,' or time-spirit, it is in the air, and many have long been anticipating it, preparing it, setting forth this and that part of it, till there is not a part, probably, of all we have said, which has not already been said by others before us, and said more learnedly and fully than we can say it" (Works, ix, xii-xiii). In meaning, I think the term may here be taken only to suggest what is widely current, what is characteristic of the temper of the age, and the force of persuasion in the passage is again in part the modesty which Arnold's metaphor allows him. But within a few sentences the potentialities of the term for being anthropomorphic are realized. The term's capacity for suggesting a cosmic force was no doubt one of Arnold's devices for persuasion, a device more powerful than the enumeration he could have made of the easily discoverable names of those who constituted for him the consensus of informed opinion in this area. The figure also I think served adequately to suggest a philosophic belief about human history that Arnold now inclined to favor, but which he declined to assert in terms of any more binding philosophical proposition. Continuing, Arnold says, the He- braisers "have little notion of letting their consciousness play on things freely, little ear for the voice of the 'Zeit-Geist' " (p. xiii). Within a few more sentences the term is associated with the compulsion of a principle of change. Arnold's reading of St. Paul is presented, climactically, as a "product of nature," as a "fruit of sound development, a genuine pro? duct of the 'Zeit-Geist' " (pp. xiii, xiv). None of this accumulated force is lost when the figure reappears as an agency in the destruction of tenets of Calvinistic Puritanism: "The predestinarian and solifidian dogmas, for the very sake of which our Puritan churches came into existence, begin to feel the irresistible breath of the 'Zeit-Geist'; some of them melt quicker, others slower, but all of them are doomed" (pp. xvi-xvii). These passages define the function of the Zeitgeist in the argument conducted in St. Paul and Protestantism; the final appearance of the figure in this preface, however, introduces a formula that seems to me to con- firm the belief that Arnold wished to suggest a cosmic power, operating through historic intellectual process, when he used the term, at least in</page><page sequence="14">990 The Zeitgeist of Matthew Arnold this passage and in Literature and Dogma. The Zeitgeist and some ra- tionalistic element are now compounded in a phrase that by repetition becomes a formula. Thus in St. Paul and Protestantism, he admits, it was natural that the Puritans should resist determinedly assaults on the doctrines of predestination or justification at a time when they believed that such doctrines constituted the essence of Christianity. "That is why," he continues, "when the 'Zeit-Geist' and the general movement of men's religious ideas is beginning to reveal that the Puritan gospel is not the essence of Christianity, we have been desirous to spread this revelation to the best of our power, and by all the aids of plain popular exposition to help it forward" (p. xxix). What is the force of "and" in the phrase "the 'Zeit-Geist' and the general movement of men's religious ideas"? In some contexts Zeitgeist is the general movement of men's ideas. Does the singular verb here sug? gest this identification? Is the phrasing tautological? Or is the Zeitgeist the causative power, the movement its manifestation? The last question seems to me to need an affirmative answer. Arnold here echoes the lan? guage of his earlier proposal that our ideas seem advanced "by a power such as Goethe figures by the Zeit-Geist or Time-Spirit, and St. Paul describes as a divine power revealing additions to what we possess al? ready." He appears calculatingly to have repeated his formula in Litera? ture and Dogma: "The 'Zeit-Geist,' and the mere spread of what is called enlightenment," "a favorable moment and the 'Zeit-Geist'," "the 'Zeit- Geist' and a prolonged and enlarged experience."28 In each instance the suggestion that an increasing spread of knowledge enforces Arnold's position is strengthened not simply by duplication of the point, but by some augmentation of it. The suggestion is that in addition to the pres- sures of human opinion making for one belief and rejecting another there is the pressure of an occult force whose manifestation is the "enlighten- ment" of the historic period. Through the essays constituting Literature and Dogma (1873), some of which had appeared first in the Cornhill Magazine in July and October 1871, the term Zeitgeist probably made its liveliest impression on readers and critics, not by any new or profound application that Arnold made of the figure, but by reiteration in the work and by the work's own popu? larity, as well as by inclusion in discussions in critical reviews. Of six British and American contemporary reviews of St. Paul and Protestantism that I have seen, two make reference to it, or quote passages containing it. Of twelve British and American reviews of Literature and Dogma, seven contain reference to it.29 The work itself was controversial in sub- 28 Works, vn, 114, 177, 330.</page><page sequence="15">Fraser Neiman 991 ject and in manner. Here Arnold sometimes overreached himself with certain vices of his rhetoric?the ill-defined catchword or phrase, face- tiousness, repetition, the occasional lapse from urbane irony to sarcasm. The analogy between the Council of the Trinity and the fairy tale of the three Lord Shaftesburys offended. The reference to Pope Pius IX was a pleasantry that had soured?"That amiable old pessimist in St. Peter's Chair, whose allocutions we read and call them impotent and vain, the Pope himself is, in his idea, the very Time-Spirit taking flesh, the in? carnate 'Zeit-Geist'l O man, how true are thine instincts, how over- hasty thine interpretations of them!" (Works, vn, xxix). The Reverend J. Llewellyn Davies, whose criticism Arnold held in respect, reported restrainedly that up to about the thirteenth recurrence, he had heard it said, Arnold's references to the Bishops of Winchester and Gloucester "continue to be, in a diminishing degree, entertaining"; after that they began to pall.30 The use of the expression Zeitgeist perhaps palled too, when it did not exasperate by the elusiveness of its meaning. Arnold used the figure Time-Spirit three times in the preface, Zeitgeist once; in the text itself, Time-Spirit is mentioned once, Zeitgeist eleven times.31 Neither word is ever defined. The best orientation to Arnold's meaning is provided by the premise he invites the sympathetic reader to grant him in his preface. Here he obliquely reaffirms his perception that development is a law of history? the history not only of states, but, as the book ultimately discloses, of the human mind. Arnold is content to apprehend Divinity as process, without other additional personal testimony than individual conscious- 29 Academy, i (Aug. 1870), 282 and Contemporary Rev., xiv (June 1870), 340; Atlantic Monthly, xxxn (July 1873), 111-112; Blackwood's Edinburgh Mag., cxm (June 1873), 690, 691, 692; Contemporary Rev., xxi (May 1873), 843, 854; Dublin Rev., lxxii (April 1873), 364; Fraser's Mag., lxxxviii (July 1873), 121,134; Sat.

Arnold's critics have assigned reasons for the style of Literature and Dogma. In "The Background of Arnold's Literature and Dogma," Modern Philology, xliii (Nov. 1945), 130, William M. Blackburn suggests that Arnold was ani- mated by his enthusiasm for the controversy. George Saintsbury conjectured in Matthew Arnold (Edinburgh, 1899), pp. 131-132, that the style was influenced by both the popular thirst for "skits" in England during the excitement of the Franco-Prussian War and Arnold's own recent excursion into farce in Friendship}s Garland. Actually the last letter of Friendship}s Garland appeared in November 1870; the first part of Literature and Dogma in July 1871. Perhaps the mood in which Arnold wrote carried over. 31 For Time-Spirit, see Works, vn, xx, xxi, xxix, 128; for Zeitgeist, see pp. xxix, 114, 128, 145, 177, 289-290, 305, 330, 337, 390.

Ironically placing himself in the category of traditional believer, he makes the important statement: "It is because we cannot trace God in history that we stay the craving of our minds with a fancy-account of him, made up by putting scattered expressions of the Bible together, and taking them literally; it is because we have a scanty sense of the life of humanity, that we proceed in the like manner in our scheme of a future state. He that cannot watch the God of the Bible, and the salva? tion of the Bible, gradually and on an immense scale discovering them? selves and becoming, will insist on seeing them ready-made."32 The stat? ure of Bishop Hooker, who Arnold claims had a historic sense, who as- signed reason as the sole criterion of judgment for deducing dogma from Scripture?the stature of Hooker is to be measured by his grasp of the role of development in the history of human intelligence. Surely appre- hension of this concept is enough, Arnold cries, "without our expecting him to make the full application of it, without expecting him to say that the Church-dogmas of his time, the dogma of the Athanasian Creed among the rest, which were not seriously in question yet, on which the Time-Spirit had not then turned his light, were false developments" (Works, vn, xx). The life of humanity appears to grow, on the side of intellect, as more and more areas of belief are validated, or rejected, by reason. Divinity manifests itself in so far as this process is discernible. The Time-Spirit is a name for divinity thus manifesting itself, not through its other channel, conscience, but through the history of the human mind. So considered, Arnold's mocking (and perhaps uncompre- hending) reference at the close of the preface to Pope Pius IX, who had so recently as July 1870 proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility, gains point, as it may also suggest confirmation of Arnold's meaning; for the surprise is not only at the arrogance of "that amiable old pessi- mist" arrogating to himself infallibility, but at the assumption that the discovery of truth is a power of individuals rather than of historic process. In isolated passages Zeitgeist may seem to be satisfactorily equated with "reason," or again it may seem synonymous with intelligent con? temporary opinion; but not only the habitual anthropomorphic meta- phors?"the Time-Spirit has not then turned his light," "the 'Zeit-Geist' has made us entertain," "the 'Zeit-Geist' who discovers it to us"?and the repeated pairs, like "a favorable moment and the 'Zeit-Geist'," but also Arnold's basic concept of development and the close association of Zeitgeist with imagery of development?"the human mind, as its experi? ence widens," "slowly does the 'Zeit-Geist' unveil it"?confer on the term in this work a nimbus, make it express a transcendental agency of intellectual change.33 To awake in the reader's mind the idea that his- 82 Works, vn, xiii-xiv. This concept finds parallel expression in Schelling. 33 Works, vn, 128-129, 289-290.</page><page sequence="17">Fraser Neiman 993 toric process operated thus inevitably to invalidate Arnold's interpreta? tion of the Bible was a powerful device of persuasion, apart from what? ever it might imply as to his own belief about the process; there is ground, however, for supposing that Arnold so believed, at least tentatively. Examination of Arnold's meanings for Zeitgeist is not equivalent to an examination of his reading of history, but it is a component of an under? standing of that reading. So regarded, it cannnot be dismissed as a fetish or a thaumaturgy, although something of the impatience that such criticism reflects arises from Arnold's unformulated and undefined use. Yet to have expressed the formula that would have contained and de? fined Zeitgeist would have been to propose a dogma concerning the na? ture of history that I think Arnold would have declined very often or very long to accept. To rest with no formulation more rigid than meta? phor was to suggest a seeming nature in historic process that was a suffi- cient commitment. I do not think Arnold's writing expresses a consistent view of history, nor do I think he ever arrived at what for him consti- tuted certainty about the dynamics of history. He published in 1861, and reprinted in 1879, a statement that contains two attitudes that preclude complete belief in a deterministic process in history, such as the use of Zeitgeist especially in St. Paul and Protestantism and Literature and Dogma seems to suggest. He said, speaking of moral perfection as conceived by Christian ethics, "Human thought, which made all in- stitutions, inevitably saps them, resting only in that which is absolute and eternal."34 The idea of permanence of ethical, or indeed any abso- lutely fixed, values seems to me inconsistent with a philosophy of history founded on the dynamics of change. The conviction that human thought originates with human beings and makes and remakes temporal in- stitutions implies an individualism incompatible with pure determinism. The latitude that Arnold's mind exhibited for entertaining opposed possibilities is dramatically shown in the last entries in his Note-Books where the determinism of Karl Marx ("Society is a sort of organism on the growth of which conscious efforts can exercis&amp; little effect") and the individualism of Thomas a Kempis ("Si est gaudium in mundo, hoc utique possidet puri cordis homo") are juxtaposed (p. 438). Social determinism and religious individualism are opposed possibilities unless one admits the romantic dichotomy with which Arnold began his poetic career and sequesters oneself from the uncontrollable phenomenal world in Obermann's forest of the isolated spirit. The almost complete absence of the Zeitgeist from God and the Bible, Arnold's reply to objections to Literature and Dogma, might well caution one against suggesting that it was a necessary term in expressing his 84 "Democracy," Mixed Essays, in Works, x, 45. "Democracy" was originally the preface to The Popular Education of France (1861).</page><page sequence="18">994 The Zeitgeist of Matthew Arnold philosophy of history;36 and indeed one should guard against assuming that each appearance of the term is necessarily the reassertion of Arnold's belief. The figure had its usefulness in the rhetoric of persuasion; it could incline the mind to belief in some kind of spiritual force causing men to hold certain opinions, while by remaining metaphorical it was not open to such specific rebuttal as would have been an abstract formulation, which Arnold was unwilling, and possibly unable, to make. How little necessary to his interpretation of intellectual change such a concept, as that embodied in this metaphor, was, is perhaps indicated by his being able to survey changes, for example in the canon of the Bible, over centuries without invoking its instrumentality. On the other hand, how potent its pressure in behalf of the argument might be, if only from its suggestiveness, is indicated by Arnold's choosing to place it in the title of the pair of discourses, "Bishop Butler and the Zeit-Geist," while almost entirely omitting to refer to it in the body of the writing. The issues of time and change, however, are not absent from either of these two essays, first delivered to the Edinburgh Philosophical Insti- tute, nor from "A Psychological Parallel" in Last Essays on Church and Religion (1877). The issues of time and change are not absent, but there is a diminished effort to suggest a theory, however shadowy, of causa- tion.36 In the discourses on Bishop Butler we hear, with reference to in? tellectual changes, that "the time inevitably arrives" when in their widening experience men question the authorities of their youth; we hear that "there are moments when" certain subjects are unpopular; we hear, with more resounding and apocalyptic rhetoric, that "the time comes,?sooner or later the time comes,?to individuals and even to societies, when the foundations of the great deep are broken up, and everything is in question"; but of causation or design we learn nothing.37 The figure Zeitgeist is cited once in the first lecture (Works, ix, 288). There its use is purely rhetorical. It signifies nothing more than human reason. The figure is cited once in the second lecture; the function and meaning are the same. The Analogy of Religion, Arnold concludes, has failed our matured experience of human psychology. "It seemed once to have a spell and a power; but the Zeit-Geist breathes upon it, and we rub 35 The term Zeitgeist is not used in God and the Bible; Time-Spirit is used only once. Speaking of the decline in belief in miracles, Arnold says of the Roman Catholic: "But for him too, even for him, the Time-Spirit is gradually becoming too strong" {Works, viii, 371). In the context of the passage Time-Spirit seems only to mean a time when the empirical experience of man is more complete than it has been. 36 In his Matthew Arnold, George Saintsbury quaintly observed of "Bishop Butler and the Zeit-Geist": "it requires rather careful 'collection' in order to discover what our friend the Zeit-Geist has to do in this galley" (p. 145). 37 Works, ix, 261, 263, 293, also 299.</page><page sequence="19">Fraser Neitnan 995 our eyes and it has the spell and the power no longer" (Works, ix, 333). Human reason has dissipated the error. The drift of these discourses insists on a strictly empirical basis for all man's knowledge; in that effort metaphysical speculation, however limited, has no place. Even the doc? trine of development to which Arnold seemed committed has shrunk almost to an Aristotelian principle of potentiality for individual growth, although Arnold does admit the growth of social behavior out of experi? ence in society. "For men are solidary, or co-partners; and not isolated."38 In "A Psychological Parallel" where Arnold, ultimately defending his own interpretation of religion as conduct, finds a parallel between St. Paul and the seventeenth-century Cambridge Platonist, John Smith, in their foundation for belief in human experience, not in miracle, the innocent premise is made that men inhabit a "certain atmosphere of belief."39 But again there is no search for cause. John Smith and the other Platonists are not the instrumentalities for the revelation of ideas; they are represented as men thinking. They perceive as reasonable and thoughtful individuals the limitations of both Puritan and Laudian doctrine, which their increasing experience as men declares outmoded. The Time-Spirit does make its way into one further essay in this volume. In "The Church of England" Arnold is not being, in Max Beerbohm's phrase, always wholly serious. John Morley, Arnold says, has remarked to his readers that "the very spirit of time" has pushed to first place the issue of disestablishment. Then, reinforcing the phrase with his own capitalization when he quotes Morley, Arnold observes with a trace of sarcasm that the Spirit of Time is "a personage for whose opera- tions I have myself the greatest respect; whatever he does, is, in my opinion, of the greatest effect" (Works, ix, 353). Although the phrasing is modified, the Spirit of Time in Arnold's text is recognizably the Time- Spirit, the Zeitgeist, not the temper of the age, neutral, unendowed with cosmic force; but its, or his, authority has dwindled from that estab? lished in St. Paul and Protestantism and Literature and Dogma. It is an instrument of ironic reference; it has no place in the argument. Appropriately, Goethe attends the departure of the Zeitgeist from Arnold's writing as he attended its entrance both in public essay and private letter. The exit is made in the essay on Byron that was printed in Macmillan's Magazine, March 1881. The spirit is shorn of its demonic powers. Neither is it the negative force of sterility expressed in the letter 38 Works, ix, 309. See also pp. 301-302,307-309,325-326. In "The Future of Liberalism," Works, xi, 142, Arnold said, "Instinctively, however slowly, the human spirit struggles towards the light; and the adoption and rejection of its agents by the multitude are never wholly blind and capricious, but have a meaning." 39 Works, ix, 210; cf. pp. 216-217.</page><page sequence="20">996 The Zeitgeist of Matthew Arnold to Clough in 1848, nor the shaping influence in the review of Dr. Stan? ley's Lectures in 1863. It is quietly, without anthropomorphic heightening, a figure like the temper of the age. It signifies the climate of popular opinion, which makes for a literary vogue. Arnold suggests that Goethe would have ascribed the greater popularity of Byron's poetry to his own, even in his own family, to the operation of the Time-Spirit. "This work? ing of the Zeit-Geist," he says, "in his favour was an advantage added to Byron's other advantages, an advantage of which he had a right to get the benefit" (Works, iv, 133). The fact of Byron's great productivity, the fact of Byron's once great popularity, the fact of the relationship of the living personality to that vogue, these are points that Arnold estab- lishes here; moreover, Arnold is interested in Byron's sensitivity to the "falsehood, cynicism, insolence, misgovernment, oppression" of his time, to his relation to the changing sensibilities of his age, but not to the de? velopment of ideas on a cosmic scale. Zeitgeist, as Arnold uses it, requires constant re-examination and re- definition as it appears from instance to instance, and the meaning is related to the strategy of the argumentation as well as to the thought of the passage. The restricted definition of the New English Dictionary, "the spirit or genius which marks the thought or feeling of a period or age," is adequate to only a limited number of contexts, of which this last, from the essay on Byron, is an example. But in the letters to Clough, Zeitgeist seems to me more accurately the current fashionable opinion, especially as opposed to ascertainable critical absolutes. And in the period of Arnold's greatest interest in intellectual change, especially as mani- fested by new interpretations of Christian doctrine, the figure of the Zeitgeist signifies a cosmic spiritual power that wills the development of human reason and that reveals development in the sequence of his? toric time. In Arnold's essays on religion the expression has its special usefulness both as a rhetorical device connoting a supernatural agency that favors Arnold's views, and as a means of suggesting, without firm assertion, the probability that the wisdom of man is ultimately the wisdom of God.
