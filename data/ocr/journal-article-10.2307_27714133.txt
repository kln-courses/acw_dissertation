<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND THE CREATION /. H. A damson, University of Utah I Milton's theory of creation ex Deo, the idea that God created the world from Himself rather than from "nothing" or from some eternal coexistent matter, is a doctrine sufficiently esoteric that scholars have interpreted it in widely differing ways. Some have considered it mate rialistic pantheism; others have been content to see it as a slightly distended orthodoxy.1 But such discussions have not fully recognized that there is an ancient and honorable Christian tradition of the ex Deo theory, and that this theory has certain logical or psychological corollaries which Milton seems consciously to have accepted. It is important, therefore, to know how this theory arose, who its proponents were, and what it meant to those who accepted it. Professor Wolfson, in commenting on theories of creation, says that there have been, traditionally, three ways of accounting for matter; it existed eternally, it was created ex nihilo, or it appeared somewhere in the process of emanation from God {ex Deo).2 Aristotle held the first view, that the universe had always existed independently of God who, in the creation, imposed form upon it. This coexistent material, according to Aristotle, was indestructible. Plato's world view was similar. He postulated an inert "first mat ter" which, energized and shaped by the World Soul, became the created universe. Whether Plato held this first matter to be uncreated and eternally existent or whether he believed that it had been created in time became a matter of dispute in early ages and still, apparently, is not settled. Philo was the first in the Judaeo-Christian tradition to criticize 1 The two works which have influenced me most, although my conclusions differ from both, are A. S. P. Woodhouse's article, "Notes on Milton's Views on the Crea tion: the Initial Phases," PQ, xxvni (January, 1949), 211-36, and an unpublished dissertation in the archives of Widener Library by John Palmer Reesing, "Milton's Philosophical View of Nature." I am much indebted to Mr. Reesing's lucid and reasoned discussion of the problem. In addition, I have familiarized myself with the literature in the field, especially a series of articles by William B. Hunter, Jr., and the writings of Walter Clyde Curry, Maurice Kelley, Denis Saurat, and others. 2 H. A.

He explicitly rejected Aristotle's "eternal world," admitting however that the world was indestructible simply because God had promised not to destroy it.3 Philo said of the Platonic view that it taught that the world was created but indestructible. He said further that this view, the correct one, had been borrowed from Moses.4 If it is granted that the world was created rather than eternal, the question arises as to what it was created from. Philo accepted the general Platonic view that it had been created by the imposition of the Forms upon the prima materia, but he differed from Plato, accord ing to Professor Wolfson, in that he specifically taught that both the prima materia and the forms themselves were first created by God. Philo, zealous for his monotheistic heritage, would admit of no exist ence outside of or independent of God.5 Inevitably, then, the question arises from what did God create the first matter? Where did it come from? This question, as far as I know, Philo never raised. The early Christian fathers, however, did raise it. They followed Philo in his insistence that no "thing'' in the universe could be prior to or coeternal with God. Like Philo, they taught that all that exists was created by Deity, who alone is self existent. When the question arose as to what the first matter was created from, Origen replied that it was made from nothing, and he cited the Book of Maccabees, "God made all these things when they did not exist," in support of his position.6 Ex nihilo, then, at least as early as Origen, became the standard Christian concept and ulti mately, after opposition from the Gnostics, it achieved the status of dogma.7 Dean Inge once remarked somewhat sharply that the ex nihilo theory is "often ignorantly ridiculed" by persons who seem to believe that God took some "nothing" and made it into a universe.8 Milton ridiculed it for precisely that reason,9 but, if mitigation is necessary, he was by no means the first to do so.

Both insist that the term rightly means only that there was no "thing" outside of God from which He made the world.10 Dean Inge also believes that this is what the concept means and he cites from Augustine: When we say that He made it out of nothing, we mean that there was no pre-existent Matter, unmade by Himself, without which He could not have made the world.11 M. Gilson says that Aquinas so construed the theory and that it was never intended to mean anything more. It is certain that nothingness is not the original matrix whence all creatures spring; being can only issue from being ... all essence is derived from the Divine essence.12 It seems clear enough that the concept of ex nihilo was not merely a verbal paradox invented to surmount a logical impasse. Rather, the theory contained, by implication, the positive assertion of the infinity and omnipresence of God and his primacy over all other existences; it asserted, in the words of Gilson, that "outside of [God] there is nothing."13 Plotinus was apparently the first in the Western world to advance the third theory of creation, namely that the universe had been gen erated, or had emanated, from the essence of God. In doing so, he denied the age-old Greek duality of matter and spirit, postulating in stead a metaphysical monism. Unlike the Stoics, however, Plotinus was careful not to attribute materiality or corporeality to God.14 There is, he said, no "real" distinction between soul or form on the one hand and body or matter on the other. That which is Form in relation to something below it may be Matter in relation to that which is above it, for omnia sunt diversis gradibus animata.lb 10 Meyer Waxman, The Philosophy of Don Hasdai Crescas, Columbia University Oriental Studies, XVII (New York, 1920), pp. 154-55. 11 Inge, Plotinus, 1, 145.

For, Thou didst not make heaven and earth out of Thyself; otherwise, it would have been equal to Thy Only-begotten Son, and in this way to Thee. . . . And, apart from Thee, there was nothing else from which Thou mightest make them, O God, One Trinity and Threefold Unity. Therefore, Thou hast made heaven and earth out of nothing. . . ,16 Augustine clearly sees that the real difficulty in the ex Deo theory for a Christian is not pantheism (which could be avoided, so it was believed, by the interposition of mediators between God and the world) but rather its incompatibility with the doctrine of the Trinity. Arius had said that the Word was created out of nothing. The ex Deo theory, on the contrary, postulated a hierarchy of life emanating from the Deity; at the head of this hierarchical order was the Logos. This is what Augustine cannot accept: a mere hierarchical excellence as the only difference between the Logos and creation. He insists, rather, on a com plete separation between them because, according to Trinitarian theory, the Father and the Son are one in essence. On the other hand, to the non-Trinitarian, to one who accepts as Milton did a Logos Christology without the later Trinitarian formula that was imposed upon it,17 the theory offers no insuperable difficulties and is attended with certain advantages. It is the Christian tradition of ex Deo, then, that we must examine. The first influential Christian to posit a theory of ex Deo, as far as I know, was the fourth-century Greek Father, Gregory ofNyssa. Gregory begins with the assumption, derived, he says, from Scripture, that all things have their being in God. He realizes that his opponents will ask, "... if material existence was in Him, how can He be im material while including matter in Himself?"18 In reply Gregory at tempts to bridge the gap between the immateriality of God and the materiality of creation by suggesting that a wish actualized may be come a substance.19 Here he seems to be resorting to the Platonic and 16 Augustine, Confessions, trans.

Actually, the Logos theory itself was an attempt to bridge such a gap and the various fantastic hierarchies of the Gnostics were attempts to set up a series of gradations separating the One and the many. But even an infinite series of gradations can never really ex plain how the Uncreated passed into creation, as Spinoza realized, and he, consequently, denied the Logos and all other mediating agencies, maintaining that extended substance was an attribute of God Himself. Although there are many differences between the metaphysical mon ism of the Christian ex Deo tradition and that of Spinoza, the denial of the Logos and mediation is the chief one. Gregory apparently realized that his first device had not really solved the problem. He then attempted a rational solution, brief and unelaborated, but imaginative and daring. That which we call body, he says, is really a collection of various attributes, and, he continues, "not one of those things which we attribute to body is itself body; neither figure nor colour, nor weight, nor extension, nor quantity, nor any other qualifying notion whatever; but every one of them is a cate gory_"20 Thus, with the transformation of the "attributes of body" into "categories," Gregory has also transformed the too too solid flesh into a series of abstractions. He then continues his logical procedure. No single category, he says, can make a body. Rather body is obviously a combination of categories, and nothing can combine categories except a thinking mind. Gregory then sweeps on to a startlingly modern con clusion. The Deity, he says, is such a thinking Mind, and therefore is perfectly capable of producing the "thinkables" whose mutual combina tion generates for us what we refer to as the substance of a given body.21 Gregory's tentative and cautious espousal of the ex Deo theory was not nearly so influential as the unqualified assertion of it by pseudo Dionysius, who was destined to have more influence on medieval thought than anyone except the very giants among the fathers such as Augustine and Jerome. Until nearly the eighteenth century, this anonymous writer was known to most of the Christian world as Diony sius the Areopagite and was almost universally believed to have been a convert of St. Paul and the first bishop of Athens.22 20 Gregory, p. 458. 21 Gregory, pp. 458-59. Gregory is here on the threshold of a theory of appearance and reality which suggests those of some relatively modern Idealists. 22 Modern scholars agree that this writer was a fifth-century Syrian monk; his work seems to be directly influenced by Proclus, whom he quotes a good deal.</page><page sequence="6">Milton and the Creation 761 Pseudo-Dionysius taught that the Godhead "contains and is the Ultimate Reality of all particular beings." And he elaborated the idea in the rhapsodic and inflated repetitive style that characterizes his work. It [the Uncreated Essence] is the life of all things that live and the Being of all that are, the Origin and Cause of all life and being through Its bounty which both brings them into existence and maintains them.23 He specifically affirmed that in God all principles and all causes existed, including the material one. On this last point, the inclusion of the ma terial cause in Deity, Aquinas, always highly respectful toward Dionysius, found it necessary to disagree, as all prononents of the ex nihilo theory were bound to do.24 Dionysius exerted little influence in the West until Scotus Erigena, in the ninth century, made his work available to the scholarly world in a Latin translation. Erigena himself was tremendously stimulated by pseudo-Dionysius and from his writings constructed a system into which he incorporated large elements from the writings of Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine.25 Erigena postulated God as the ultimate Unknowable source of all things. The Logos, for him as for Philo, was not only a personage but also the aggregate of the Ideas in the Divine Mind and contained, therefore, the series of primal causes. In this manner the Logos medi ated between the Unknowable and the creation.26 Erigena accepts the fact that creation is ex nihilo if he is allowed to define the term. His definition is ingenious. The formula ex nihilo, he says, does not mean that creation is from nothingness {ex nihil nihilo) but rather that it is from "no thing." There is only one Being that is not a thing or object, that exists within and of itself, and that, of course, is God. Creation, ex nihilo, therefore, rightly understood, means creation ex Deo. Erigena's definition rests on a concept of nihil as that which surpasses all finite understanding and therefore may be said to be not. Nihil does not mean mere privation of existence.27 23 Dionysius the Areopagite on the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology, trans. C. E.

Denomy (Cambridge, Mass., 1948), p. 357.</page><page sequence="7">762 A dams on After Erigena, there are many thinkers in the Christian tradition who, despite minor individual variations, taught a metaphysical monism based on a theory of creation ex Deo. The great name in the later tradition is Meister Eckhart, that towering genius among the medieval mystics. Eckhart was influenced both by Erigena and pseudo-Dionysius.28 From Eckhart the basic concepts of metaphysical monism flowed in a broad stream into Christian thought through such disciples as Tauler and Suso. Jacob Boehme's thought largely derives from these sources and not, as is sometimes supposed, directly from heaven. Among Catholic churchmen by far the most significant thinker in this tradition was Nicholas of Cusa, a disciple of both Eri gena and Eckhart. Giordano Bruno professed a great debt to Nicholas, whom he called "the divine Cusanus."29 The question of whether the ex Deo theory is, or can be, orthodox, has been agitated a good deal. Erigena's teaching was condemned as a "Scot's porridge" by the Synod of Valence in 885, a judgment that is still upheld by the Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Erigena "fell into many errors." On the other hand, Nicholas of Cusa, a great ecclesiastical statesman and Cardinal, has been consistently vindicated even though, as Henry Bett says, there is "a striking paral lel between the whole system of the Cardinal and that of the Scot."30 Actually Cusa defended the orthodoxy of his emanationist position simply by asserting that although all was from God, yet God, in a mysterious manner, transcended all,31 a statement that appears in Erigena and in all other thinkers in the tradition, a statement that is one of the basic concepts of the tradition. When one recalls that Eckhart's teachings were being condemned, after his death, by the Inquisition at the same time that the teachings of pseudo-Dionysius were being upheld with repressive measures, one recognizes the need for sanity, the need to suspend judgment on orthodoxy, to abandon, at least temporarily, the terms materialism, pantheism and the others, and try to determine what the doctrine 28 See Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v.

Eastern and Western mystics agreed on one basic paradox: God was immanent and He was also transcendent. He contained all things but was contained by nothing.32 In no writer is the insistence on this paradox more striking than in Erigena. Blewett says that "on almost every page" of Erigena one can find the God who transcends abso lutely and yet at the same time pours Himself forth in the forms of na ture.33 Nicholas of Cusa presents us again and again with the same para dox. The being of the universe derives from God, but the being of God does not de rive from the universe. All begins from God and all ends in God. . . . God is all of all that is, and yet nothing of all that is.34 In fact, Nicholas considered that the principle of the "coincidence of contraries," was the central truth of his system, and this truth, he said, flashed upon him with the force and power of supernatural revela tion.35 Eckhart illustrates the same paradox. The more God is in all things, the more He is outside them. The more He is within, the more without.36 We may ask then if this relation of God to the universe is panthe istic. If pantheism is defined as a belief that the sum total of "things" in the universe is equal to God, we can certainly say that the ex Deo view is at the farthest remove from such a concept. Or if pantheism means that God is thought to be equally in all things, again, as will be shown, the ex Deo theorists were not pantheists. If, on the other hand, pantheism is loosely used to describe any system or concept in which the immanence of God in the universe is mystically felt and movingly uttered, then the whole mystical tradition, East and West, is panthe istic. 32 Rudolf Otto, Mysticism East and West, trans. B. L. Bracy and R. C. Payne (New York, 1932), pp. 77 ff. Perhaps the central concept of Hinduism is the phrase "Brahman is Atman." Brahman is God transcendent and Atman is God immanent, and properly understood, the two are one. 33 Blewett, p. 286. 34 Bett, Nicholas of Cusa, pp. 104, 105.1 am quoting Bett's paraphrase. 35 Nicholas of Cusa, pp. 127-28. 36 Quoted by Aldous Huxley in The Perennial Philosophy (New York, 1945), p. 2.</page><page sequence="9">764 A dams on We come then to the question of the materiality or pantheism of Milton's ex Deo concept. In a sense, even the question, "Is God ma terial?" is an absurdity to the thinkers in the ex Deo tradition inas much as they never weary of insisting that nothing can ever be known of God. The finite mind may consider "attributes," but must realize that these attributes are merely a finite attempt to describe infinitude. There is no thinker known to me in the ex Deo tradition who ever re motely suggested that materiality was an attribute of God until Spinoza; all did maintain, however, that the Deity contained the ma terial cause within Himself. With this latter point, Milton, of course, agreed.37 Further, the question of the materiality of God has no mean ing in a system of metaphysical monism. Thinkers in this tradition, to such a question, would reply that we are not in a dualistic universe of body and spirit, matter and form, but rather in a monistic universe where everything that exists is a gradation of one prime matter. At the lowest end of the scale are what a dualist would call material: rocks, earth, flesh, and money. At the other end of the scale are the immaterial things such as soul, spirit, and pure intelligence. God is neither the one nor the other; He is beyond both, and beyond any concept that may be formed of Him. But the higher end of the scale is nearer God, in a sense more like Him, than the lower end of the scale. Thus, although both are what God is not, materiality is what He most emphatically is not, it being the furthest removed from Him. Milton goes to great lengths to assert the transcendence of God and preserve Him from any trace of the anthropomorphic and corporeal. "To know God as he really is," Milton says in De Doctrina Christiana, "far transcends the power of man's thoughts. . . . "38 His statement that "God is the primary, and absolute, and sole cause of all things" can be matched anywhere in Judaic or Christian orthodoxy. Milton never says that the substance of things existed in God but rather that "a diversified and substantial virtue" is in Deity. Milton acknowl edges, as had Gregory of Nyssa, that it is exceedingly difficult to see how body emanated from spirit.39 But Milton feels that it is even more difficult to believe that body originated from "nothing."40 He then offers a suggested explanation, exceedingly simple, but one which 37 Works, x.v, 2i. 38 Works, xiv, 31. 39 The author of the Tao Teh King acknowledged the same difficulty. "These two things, the spiritual and material, though we call them by different names, in their origin are one and the same. This sameness is a mystery?the mystery of mysteries." 40 Works, xv, 21, 23, 25.</page><page sequence="10">Milton and the Creation 765 shows again that he is attempting to avoid attributing corporeality to God. A more excellent substance such as spirit, he says, contains within itself, virtually and eminently, the inferior substance. In such a way, he continues, God or the substance of God contains within it self a "bodily power."41 Here it seems to me is the clearest indication of what Milton's position really is. The words "virtually" and "eminently" were scholastic terms used to indicate that a thing possessed or contained another thing in a more perfect or higher manner than was required for a formal possession of it. Thus Aquinas states that God virtually contains all being.42 Duns Scotus used the terms "virtually" and "eminently" in constructing his metaphysical hierarchy of the principles of being. Scotus postulated a twofold order consisting of an order of "eminence" and an order of "dependence." In the order of eminence the final cause comes first, followed by the efficient, the formal and the material. The supreme existent, according to Scotus, as first in the order of causation therefore "virtually" con tains the totality of actuality, and it "eminently" contains the "per fections of all created things."43 Similarly, Aquinas had said that effects pre-exist in their causes, but he added that they exist only according to the mode of being of the cause.44 By that he means that if an object exists in God, for example, it exists only according to the mode of God's being, not according to its own mode of being. I think it would be a reasonable simplification of the matter to say that "virtually" and "eminently" were terms devised to indicate the possibility of a higher thing containing a lower without in turn being contained by it. When Milton says that spirit virtually and eminently contains matter, he simply means that spirit is a higher cause and thus, in a higher manner, contains the lower cause in itself even as God "virtually and emi nently" contains all things within Himself. Again, when Milton says that there is a "bodily power" in the sub stance of God, he is not saying that God is corporeal. Gregory of Nyssa had said that a wish actualized may become a substance. Prob ably no man was less capable by nature and training than Jacob Boehme of making subtle metaphysical distinctions; consequently both More and Cudworth accused him of teaching that God had a 41 Works, xv, 25. It was in Mr. Reesing's dissertation that I first discovered that Sumner had mistranslated "eminently" and had used the term ''essentially.'' 42 Gilson, Aquinas, p. 140. 43 C. R. S. Harris, Duns Scotus (Oxford, 1927), 11, 69-72. 44 Gilson, Aquinas, p. 137.</page><page sequence="11">766 A dams on body. But such a sympathetic and able scholar as Dr. Hans Lassen Martensen sees clearly that when Boehme says that Nature is con tained in God, he does not also mean that God is contained in Nature. Dr. Martensen readily admits that one may find pantheistic implica tions in Boehme, but he believes that what Boehme is trying to say is that it is not matter, but rather an "energetic potency" that is in God, and this potency is the fons originis of matter.45 Boehme's "energetic potency" and Milton's "bodily power" are two ways of saying pretty much the same thing. Gregory of Nyssa had specifically stated that from God, whose nature is that of thought or spirit, a material world could come.46 Milton, too, believed that God was spirit "in his most simple nature," and that the creation was a "species of external effi ciency."47 I can see no essential difference in the two views. In summary, then, the ex Deo theory of creation is inextricably linked with the mystical tradition in the great Western religions. Pro ponents of the view in the Christian Church, in Judaism or Islam, all would have considered it an impossible sacrilege to attribute corporeal ity to God. At most, it could be maintained only that they did so with out realizing it. Spinoza, it must be emphasized, was the first to make extended substance an attribute of God; but before doing so he found it necessary to refute the idea of a Logos and all other mediators be tween the Unknowable and the created world. For the very function of these mediatorial agents was to bridge the chasm between God and matter without involving God in materiality. Far from denying the Logos, Milton made it the central doctrine of his theology, and there is no indication whatever that he had any intention of positing extended substance as an attribute of God. On the contrary, when he lists the attributes of God, Milton names only immaterial ones: truth, spirit, immensity, infinity, eternity, immutability, incorruptibility, omnipres ence, omnipotence, and unity.48 According to Milton, even the Logos, who is of the substance of God, cannot be of the essence, for that would mean that a change had occurred, that Deity had emptied itself or had been altered.49 The attribution of extended substance to Deity is, in fact, the most characteristic and one of the most original features of Spinoza's 45 Jacob Boehme, trans. T. Rhys Evans (London, 1885), p. 173. 46 Cf.

To attribute such a view to Milton would entail an impor tant change in the current views of history of philosophy and would re quire substantiation, but the fact is that Milton specifically avoided stating or implying such a view. His view of creation, it seems to me, must be understood as falling under the general emanationist theory that a potency existed in God, and that the potency was made actual, somehow, through the process of emanation.60 11 The question remains as to whether Milton really belongs to the ex Deo tradition, or whether he more or less fell into a similar position without realizing it. One might even question whether a mystical philosophy, ex tending over many hundreds of years, can be coherent enough to be said to have a defined position on a given subject. Mr. George N. Conklin has denied that Milton belongs to a defined traditional view. Milton's position, despite the similarities of Plato, Lucretius, Philo, Eriugena, Servetus, Gerson, Ibn Ezra, Fludd, Boehme, and others is uniquely his and was independently derived from his exegetical conclusions alone. No precise parallel can, in fact, be found between Milton's conception of the creation and that of any other.81 60 In taking this position, I am aware that I disagree with the formidable authority of Mr. Woodhouse. I believe that the crucial difference between his view and mine is that he, in my opinion, does not recognize the fact that Spinoza attributed extended substance to Deity only after he had denied the mediators, including the Logos, the very function of which was to keep God from involvement in corporeality. Further, the fundamental argument Milton advanced against Trinitarian views was that if the Logos were of one essence with God, his emanation would indicate a change in Deity, which Milton would by no means allow. A man who would stick at this point would hardly be likely to make matter, the most mutable of all existences, a part of God. 61 George N. Conklin, Biblical Criticism and Heresy in Milton (Columbia Univer sity Press, 1949), p. 67. In a footnote to this assertion, Mr. Conklin states that Milton's doctrine of creation ex Deo is unique in two ways: first in its teaching that God is unwill ing or, properly speaking, unable to annihilate any created thing and, second, the fact that Milton was the only one to derive his doctrine ''solely from the first verb of the Bible." However, the doctrine of God's inability to annihilate created beings is, as will be shown, a commonplace of the ex Deo tradition. The second point also will not stand scrutiny. Professor Wolfson tells us that "the very starting point" of all Talmudic inter pretation is the idea that any Biblical text worthy of serious study must be assumed to have been written "with such care and precision that every term, expression, generali zation or exception is significant ..." (see Crescas' Critique of Aristotle [Cambridge, Mass., 1929], pp. 24-25). Further, the Spanish Jewish scholar, Ibn Ezra, favored the philological approach as the "best way to arrive at the true meaning of Scripture," and his Biblical exegesis, for which he was widely noted, is based principally upon the philological method. Ibn Ezra supported his denial of creation ex nihilo by philological argument. Isaac Husik says, The Hebrew word "bara," ordinarily translated "created," which implies</page><page sequence="13">7 68 Adams on I agree, certainly, that Milton's view of Scripture was a significant factor in his acceptance of the theory. That Milton's theory is unique, however, seems to me a dangerous statement, incapable of demonstra tion. Milton's treatment of the ex Deo theory, compared to the compre hensive and thorough treatment given it by Erigena or Cusa, seems very sketchy indeed, the merest outline of his belief, a credo, not a sys tem. It is thus rather difficult to compare it in great detail with one of the preceding systems. I do believe, however, that Professor Conklin's theory can be tested by the analogy of what is known in medicine as a syndrome. That word is used to denote a situation or condition in which a group of symptoms are concurrently present, making diagnosis relatively certain. The ex Deo theory, through the centuries, has logi cally or psychologically gathered around itself certain auxiliary con cepts. If these auxiliary concepts can be shown in the writings of the other thinkers in the ex Deo tradition and if, in turn, they can be shown in the writings of Milton, it will be very difficult to divorce Milton from the tradition. For that an original thinker such as Milton might have arrived at one important concept independently is one thing; that he should have arrived at a linked group of concepts is some thing else. The first postulate of the ex Deo theory is that God is forever un knowable and that, as a result, he can best be understood through the via negativa, that is, by saying and thinking of what God is not, rather than what he is. And the mystics of the via negativa have developed a characteristic set of images by which they express the Deity. Thus Dionysius the Areopagite says, Unto this Darkness which is beyond Light we pray that we may come and attain unto vision. . . . Again he speaks of that "super-essential Darkness which is hidden by all the light that is in existent things."62 to most people the idea of creatio ex nihilo, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or bound ary. (See A History of Jewish Philosophy [New York, 1916], pp. 184, 187.) "Bara" is, of course, the first verb in the Hebrew Bible. The student of Milton will immediately be reminded by Ibn Ezra's definition of Milton's creation scene where the Son with the golden compasses inscribes the boundary of the created world. That Milton knew Ibn Ezra cannot be demonstrated, but Henry More knew his exegesis and quotes a philological interpretation from it at some length in Philosophical Writ ings, "Defence of the Literal Cabbala," p. 67. 52 Rolt, pp. 194, 196.</page><page sequence="14">Milton and the Creation yog This image of Darkness to indicate the unknowability of God be comes a universal characteristic of the ex Deo tradition. It is altogether typical of Erigena that he should use the image, but refer it to a source in Scripture. Thus he speaks of God who solus habet immortalitalem, et lucem habitat inaccessibilem. Eckhart says that the Logos is the bright flowing river whose source is the "Bottomless Abyss," or the "Motionless Dark."54 It is the same idea but a different and familiar metaphor when he says that the splendor of the divine light is a cloud and that "God is found on the mountain in the cloud."55 It is enough, perhaps, in addition to these citations, to recall the title of such a work as The Cloud of Unknowing, which employs the same imagery of the cloud on Mt. Sinai that Eck hart had used, to see how this concept of the Unknowability of God came to be imaged in a certain way. The central image of this concept may be summed up in the statement from Dionysius that "the Divine Darkness is unapproachable Light in which God dwells."56 Milton teaches, in De Doctrina, that to know God as He really is surpasses man's comprehension. He follows this statement by citing from I Timothy 5:16, a passage which Erigena was fond of: "dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto."57 Milton notes further that the complete unknowability of the Divine Glory is revealed by the fact that a description, such as man is capable of understanding, is contained in the scriptural phrase, "mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke," or "the cloudy pillar descended," or "the cloud filled the house of Jehovah."58 The poetry reveals even more clearly Milton's use of the central images of the ex Deo tradition. In the Invocation to Light in Paradise Lost, it is said that God never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternity. . . . (Ill, 4-5) The imagery of darkness appears in the splendid lines from the Angelic hymn. thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thyself invisible 63 Erigena, De Divisione Naturae, p. 7. 64 Quoted by Rufus Jones in The Flowering of Mysticism (New York, 1939), p. 77. 66 Meister Eckhart, trans.

(Ill, 374-81) One may compare this description with John Tauler's statement, "This is the quiet Desert of the Godhead, the Divine Darkness?dark from His own surpassing brightness, as the shining of the sun is dark ness to weak eyes. . . . "59 The cloud imagery, central to the writings of the via negativa, Milton carries through the entire epic. Only to the Son, the Divine Similitude, is God known, In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines. . . . (Ill, 385-86) In the Seventh Book, after the creation, "incense Clouds / Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount" (VII, 599-600). When the Son is proclaimed Messiah in Book V, the Father is likened to "a flaming Mount, whose top / Brightness had made invisible ..." (V, 598-99). Again, the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. (X, 31-33) Here again Milton indicates that the Unknowable is known only to the Logos, who in turn reveals him to man. So spake the Father and unfolding bright Toward the right hand his Glory, on the Son Blaz'd forth unclouded Deity; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express'd. . . . (X, 63-67) But, it may be asked, was not the unknowability of God simply a commonplace of Christian theology? Certainly it was, but still one cannot fail to recognize the difference in the tendency to think of God in terms of his known attributes on the one hand and to approach by the via negativa on the other. It is the difference between Ames and Eckhart or Calvin and Dionysius. Because they see God in terms of darkness, the mystics of the via negativa tend toward the poetic and rhapsodic in their depiction of him; the ineffable that must be expressed 59 Quoted by Jones, Studies in Mystical Religion, p. 278.</page><page sequence="16">Milton and the Creation 771 tends to formulate itself in mystical and lyrical terms. No reader of Paradise Lost can doubt, I think, that the via negativa is Milton's most inspired and continuous approach to the Deity. By this approach Milton preserves the sanctity and transcendence of God who is the cloud of Unknowing revealed only to the Son. Rufus Jones has said of Eckhart that no one has gone further "in the direction of removing all anthropomorphic traits from God."60 His statement applies to the en tire tradition and it is certainly true of the portrait of Deity in Para dise Lost. A far more significant auxiliary concept of the ex Deo theory, per haps the most characteristic and essential one, is that of egressus-re gressus, the theory that all which emanated from God would ultimately return to him. Plotinus conceived of a kind of cosmic convection cur rent in which life first flowed out from the Fount of Rest descending through all hierarchies of Being and then ultimately ascending by the same degrees. The life of Nature, for Plotinus, was a constant aspiration toward the higher forms of activity.61 This Plotinian concept is bril liantly embodied in Augustine's declaration that "all creation yearns toward God." Plotinus described this cosmic systole and diastole as follows. The procession of intelligence consists in descending to things that occupy the lowest rank, and which have an inferior nature. . . . Finally there occurs a conversion which brings them back from the lower to the higher natures.62 The pseudo-Dionysius accepts the emanation and return, postulat ing an advance along the hierarchies of being from simple to complex as life is added to mere being, consciousness is added to life, and, finally, as rationality is added to consciousness.63 Further, according to Diony sius, as life progresses in the scale of being, it comes nearer to God and increasingly participates in His perfections.64 Erigena, as we would expect, systematized the idea and worked out in more detail both the procession and return. He taught that all proceeds from the super-essentiality of God which can only be called Non-Being or the Unknowable. Next to the Unknowable is the Logos which, although central to his system, remains largely a metaphysical 60 Jones, p. 225. 61 Inge, Plotinus, 1, 155. 62 Plotinos?Complete Works, trans. Kenneth S.

These causes are the beginning of every essence and all life.65 Descending out of these abstract and primordial causes, God may be said to "become" in the effects of those causes and is manifested in his theophanies.66 For Erigena, obviously, the Son is part of the "forthgoing of God" and hence is a second cause, as he was for Milton. Only God is without cause.67 Further, Erigena specifically stated that it was not from the essence but rather from the substance of the Father that the Son proceeded, a position which Milton also held.68 The regressus of all creatures to the Divine, as developed by Eri gena, is of particular interest to the student of Milton. Erigena con ceived of a progression up the chain of being as earthy corporeality ac quired vital motion, as vital motion was transformed into sense, sense into reason, and reason into soul.69 Ultimately the lower and disparate faculties are progressively unified in higher faculties. Thus far the pro gression is all within the natural order. In the supernatural order, Soul is transformed into Intelligence, Intelligence into Wisdom, and Wisdom unites the purified soul with the Divine Wisdom which is the Logos. Thus the soul, through the Logos, is again reunited to God.70 The forthgoing and return is a fundamental part of Eckhart's thought also. Things all flow out of him as light to manifest the hidden light. . . . Herein lies proof that all things are light, the Father having poured them forth to manifest his concealment, even as all things are shown a light to light them back into themselves, those who do not choose to turn away. Know, all creatures are asking this question, they are eager for being, to find divine being; all study of the works of nature is nothing but a search for, a question about the dwelling of God.71 Nicholas of Cusa, who owed much to Eckhart, develops the same con cept. All being begins and ends in God, he said, as motion begins from rest and ends in rest.72 65 Cf. Blewett, p. 287. 66 Erigenae, De Divisione, p. 243. 67 See Bett, Erigena, p. 25. Cf. Blewett, p. 283. 68 Works, xrv, 193. 69 Erigenae, De Divisione Naturae, p. 591. This passage is important enough to be reproduced: "Ac primus erit mutatio terreni corporis in mo turn vitalem: secundus vitalis motus in sensum; ter tins sensus in rationem; dehinc rationis in animum; in quo finis totius rationalis creaturae constituitur" (V, 39). Cf. Paradise Lost, V, 479-87. 70 Erigenae, p. 591; cf. Bett, Erigena, p. 86, and Blewett, p. 327. 71 Eckhart, 11, 191, 128. 72 Bett, Nicholas of Cusa, p. 105.</page><page sequence="18">Milton and the Creation 773 Milton, too, develops the doctrine of the emanation and return. O Adam, one Almighty is, from whom All things proceed, and up to him return. If not depraved from good. . . . (V, 469-71) In his further development of this theme, Milton shows a progression both in nature and in man more or less corresponding with that which Erigena had shown in nature as a whole. In plants, Milton says, the root comes first, motionless and dull; from it springs the green stalk which in turn produces leaves, last the bright consummate flow'r Spirits odorous breathes. . . . (V, 481-82) Thus is shown a progression from dull matter to odorous spirits within the vegetable realm. That realm is transcended when the fruit of plants, eaten by man, is "by gradual scale sublim'd." Renaissance sci ence taught that food generates vital heat which in turn generates the three kinds of spirits which correspond to the threefold division of the soul. At the highest level, the "intellectual" spirits, as Milton calls them, knit the material and immaterial parts of man together, some of these spirits passing over into pure intellectual substance.73 It is by this process, according to Milton, that the soul is enabled to receive life, sense, fancy, understanding, and reason. Nor is this process con fined to man and his world; it is, rather, universal and cosmic. of Elements The grosser feeds the purer, Earth the sea, Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon. ... (V, 415-18) Thus Milton shows the regressus, the yearning of all life toward its common source. Another auxiliary concept of the ex Deo theory, another symptom that goes to make up the syndrome, is the theory that if all life comes from God, no being can ever be finally annihilated. One finds this con cept in Plotinus and in the other thinkers in this tradition. Erigena, for example, states, When it is said that the last enemy will be destroyed . . . this does not mean substance, created of God, is to perish. . . ,74 Eckhart teaches the same thing when he says that God is not the de 73 E.

"It is not in God," he says, "to destroy any thing that has being."76 Milton, in De Doctrina, resolutely commits himself to the same prop osition. Matter, he says, "proceeded incorruptible from God; and even since the fall it remains incorruptible as far as concerns its essence." And speaking of the doctrine of ex Deo, he says, I proceed to consider the necessary consequence of this doctrine, namely, that if all things are not only from God, but of God, no created thing can be finally annihilated.76 There is one other auxiliary concept which the ex Deo theory seemed logically to suggest, a concept which was either held or implied by the thinkers in the tradition, and that is the idea of a plurality or an infinity of worlds. Erigena taught that creation was an integral part of the nature of God and that He, therefore, necessarily created. This necessity, he explained, was that which belonged to a moral nature and was therefore a "free necessity," God acting according to the necessity of His own nature.77 Eckhart held that creation was the eternal process of God's thought. He envisioned an infinite Deity whose essential nature is creative. In fact he said that creare, meaning conferre esse, was the prin cipal function of Deity.78 A doctrine of an infinite Deity whose nature is essentially creative implies an infinite creation. Nicholas of Cusa, like Eckhart, taught that creation was a neces sary consequence of the very nature of God, but that the "necessity" was only moral, in no way external. Nicholas' own theory of creation as a circle that begins and ends in God also implies a continuous creativity, which in turn demands a plurality of worlds.79 It was prob ably his study of Cusanus that set Bruno thinking about an infinite uni verse.80 Whether Milton believed in a multiplicity of worlds is, I suppose, open to question. Quite obviously he "uses" a finite universe in Paradise Lost. Also, Adam asks Raphael what "Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest / Through all Eternity so late to build" (VII, 91-92), 75 Eckhart, il, 35-36. 76 Works, xv, 23-25, 27. 77 Bett, Erigena, pp. 94-96. 78 Otto, Mysticism: East and West, p. 87; Bett, Erigena, p. 191. 79 Bett, Nicholas of Cusa, pp. no-ii, 105. 80 William Boulting, Giordano Bruno (London, 1914), P- 30.</page><page sequence="20">Milton and the Creation 775 which implies that the creation of the earth was a unique event. God himself announces that the creation of man is for a special purpose, that of filling up the vacancy in the heavenly hierarchy created by the fall of the Angels (VII, 150-61). On the other hand, Milton shows un mistakable signs of dissatisfaction with the idea of a single creation. In De Doctrina, he raises the question of what occupied God from all eternity, and dismisses impatiently the idea that He was wholly con cerned for all that time with devising the divine decrees.81 Further, Milton is definitely attracted to the idea of a plurality of worlds, al though even in Paradise Lost he seems wary of speculating about it. The universe, Raphael tells Adam, is large That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. (VIII, 103-106) When Satan is flying toward earth he makes his way through stars which "nigh hand seem'd other Worlds . . . but who dwelt happy there / He stay'd not to enquire" (III, 566, 570-71). Raphael does specifically suggest the possibility of life on the moon (VIII, 145), and the Angels' hymn after the Creation of the earth goes a good deal further. Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n From Heaven Gate not far, founded in view Of the clear Hyaline, The Glassy Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Stars Numerous, and every Star perhaps a World Of destin'd habitation. . . . (VII, 617-22) The phrase "almost immense" may be the clearest indication of Milton's meaning. He is using the word with the full meaning of the Latin inmensus, so great that it cannot be measured. In De Doctrina Milton named "immensity" as one of the attributes of God. What he seems to imply is that only God is infinite and that the universe is "almost" so. It is very much like Nicholas of Cusa's statement that the universe "is infinity contracted to the relatively infinite."82 Few readers will fail to perceive the force of Douglas Bush's remark that "Milton's imagination responds, as no other English poet's has responded with equal power, to the conception of infinite space."83 81 Works, xv, 3-5, 29-31. 82 Nicholas of Cusa, Of Learned Ignorance, trans.

Thus the description of the syndrome is as complete as I am able to make it. Other affinities of Milton for the ex Deo tradition will be sug gested, but those capable of demonstration, that I am aware of, are those that have been discussed: namely that God is the immanent ground of all things, yet wholly transcendent and best approached by way of the via negativa; that there is a procession of all being from the Divine and a yearning to return; that all created beings, inasmuch as they are outflowings of the Divine, are indestructible, and, finally, that the creative activity of an infinite God strongly implies a plurality or infinity of worlds. To these general propositions, I think it can be shown that every thinker in the ex Deo tradition, including Milton, assented. Surely it is obvious that the main movement of mind in the seventeenth century was from Greek dualism, which had something of a late flowering in Descartes, to metaphysical monism and to the later Idealists. Hegel's debt, especially to Eckhart but also to Boehme, is well known, as is Spinoza's to Crescas, Moses of Cordova, and other Neo-Platonists. If Milton is placed in this tradition, he may lose some thing in solitary grandeur, but surely he becomes more comprehensible when he is seen in a movement central to his age. There is one other auxiliary concept associated with the ex Deo theory, another corollary of the general tradition, but one that is difficult to demonstrate. The difficulty arises not from inability to per ceive it, but rather because it is a matter of tone and feeling rather than of declarative statement. For the ex Deo theory, more than the ex nihilo, emphasizes the immanence of God in creation. Thus the corollary of the ex Deo theory of creation is a theory of a deiform na ture, one which is most radically opposed to a mechanistic nature. Such a theory induces a feeling for the beauty manifested in all forms of life. Plotinus, Dionysius, Erigena, Nicholas of Cusa, especially Eckhart and Boehme all have a feeling for nature that is something more than an abstract perception and appreciation of forms and colors; it tends to be "Wordsworthian," in its deep love and affinity for the living forms of nature that reveal the immanent presence of the Beautiful. For Plotinus, says Dean Inge, "the natural world, which we see with our eyes, is spiritual throughout and instinct with life. ..." Recognizing that nature is not the Beautiful itself, but rather an</page><page sequence="22">Milton and the Creation 777 image of it, Plotinus asks, "But could there be a more beautiful image?"84 Blewett points out that Erigena "had a keen eye and affection for the face of nature," and, he continues, the God who goes forth from Himself, communicates Himself, and gives rise to a universe which in the ordered scale of its existences is full of harmony and beauty and in its natural arrangements testifies of spiritual truths. . . ,85 Rudolf Steiner has noted in an article on Eckhart that the logical result of his idea of creation is the "universal ensouling of nature."86 For those who accept the ex Deo theory and to whom it is something more than an intellectual counter, the world is literally "charged with the grandeur of God," and "it will flame out" as it does in the best of Blake's poetry just as it does in the writings of Jacob Boehme where Blake went to school.87 The universe created ex Deo is an organic uni verse and the finer breath of its being is divine. Ralph Cudworth, Milton's contemporary, in speaking of the mech anistic world of the seventeenth century, the creation of Descartes, Hobbes and others, said, They make a kind of dead and wooden world, as it were a carved statue, that hath nothing neither vital nor magical at all in it.88 Such a universe Cudworth found "highly obnoxious" and he con structs a different one in which the earth is permeated by soul and does not subsist "alone by itself as a dead thing, but is still livingly united to [God], essentially dependent on him, always supported and upheld, quickened and enlivened, acted and pervaded by him. . . . "89 With such wholly opposed conceptions of the universe, the polar opposites of the mechanistic and deiform, struggling for the possession of the minds of the age, it is unlikely that Milton could have been un aware of the conflict or that he could have viewed with any more com placency than did Cudworth the ascendancy of mechanistic material ism. With the conflict over the nature of Nature in mind, it is interesting 84 Inge, Plotinus, i, 161-62, 198. 85 Blewett, The Study of Nahire, p. 275. 86 Rudolf Steiner, in Mystics of the Renaissance (New York, 1911), p. 64. 87 The quotations are from Gerard Manley Hopkins. 88 Cudworth, The True Intellectual System of the Universe, ed.

Here rhythm, sound, and image are united in a depiction of an organic, fecund, and vital universe. Here is the Abyss with the great wings brooding over it, the fertility gods of masculine sun and feminine earth, the sexual love of man awakening cosmic echoes, the water spawning into life, the plastic and seminal earth burgeoning into ordered and harmonious forms of being, varied, intricate, vital, lovely, and won drous. Against the barrenness of the world of pulleys and levers, weari some beyond utterance, against the abstract and impersonal horror of the great machine, Milton created an organic universe and a deiform nature, glowing with vitality, permeated by symbols of life and love, possessed of a haunting loveliness that mirrored the Source of its being. It is difficult not to feel that Milton's universe is both a response and an answer to the rising mechanism and materialism of his age and that his ex Deo theory of creation provided him with the concepts and orien tations from which such a universe could be constructed. In construct ing it, he certainly, we may presume, fulfilled his own needs. I believe it is not too much to say that he also met the needs of an age.</page></plain_text>
