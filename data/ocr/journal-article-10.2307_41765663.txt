Much digital ink has been posted regarding its grim vision of the postapoc- alyptic Earth, its ambivalent technophobia, its cynical view of bureaucracy, and its relentless pastiche of pseudoscience, PVC, and religious philosophy.2 Notably, however, there has been a virtual silence regarding its portrayal of the contem- porary city, a city that is more a mental condition than a place or location. Born of a rationality pushed to its logical extreme, the Matrix is synonymous with that collective delusion referred to in the film as "the City," and that city, being no place, is paradoxically everywhere. Instead of a clashing heterotopia full of dynamic discord, the City has become a monotonous homotopia consisting of a single typology: the Downtown. Inhabited by disembodied minds restlessly dreaming their false reality, the Downtown is the heart of a shifting collective without discernable boundaries. Hence it is a "siteless" district defined by how it appears rather than where it is, for no center can exist for a body of infinite extensibility. In place of site, there is only CITY, an opaque word redundantly inscribed across every available wall, window, and vehicle drifting through the strangely depleted streets. Maddeningly vague, yet perversely explicit at the same time, the linguistic sign is everywhere, ranging from the ironic CITY HOARDING notices to the CITY garbage truck that pulverizes the CITY phone booth near the HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL, the condemned building that is the site of the narrative's beginning, as well as its resolution and end. Neither workplace nor shelter, the derelict hotel serves as representational core of this cinematic environment. Its central position exposes the metaphor of the human body that links the human frame to an urban condition here imagined 51 1.

The purported condi- tion of "not-real," however, is only intelligible in opposition to the "real," here envisioned as a joyless terrain mottled by cor- poreal bodies capable of, if not necessarily privy to, authentic or "self-founded" experience.* For all of its bleak discoloration, the filmmakers' vision of philosopher Jean Baudrillard's "desert of the real" is governed by the familiar laws of New- tonian physics in which bodies fall, entropy occurs, and two objects cannot occupy the same space. However, we are ulti- mately shown that even in the physical world these laws are vulnerable to revision, for the heart of the city - not an aban- doned hotel but a throbbing, bleeding, human heart - will violate them. The metaphor permits the impossible. The minds of the people are already gone; it is their hearts that remain to be won. More than just a platitude, the iden- tification of emotion as the only true escape from the City is one of the reasons why the first installment of The Matrix trilogy is interesting in a way that its two subsequent compan- ions are not. The urban condition is its principal subject, sus- tained throughout the film as form, symbol, and setting. Yet the building at its representational core, the Heart O* The City Hotel, represents no body, no place, and no one, and thus is uninhabitable. However, absences are only significant in rela- tionship to expectations; we recognize what is not there by virtue of what remains. It is thus to those remains that this essay turns its attention and, by so doing, will give shape to the body lost in the City. No Body [Resonance] subsists not in the heart of man but above his head. -Foucault The "no body" in question is a nondescript computer pro- grammer experiencing two different lives. As "Thomas A. Anderson" during the day, he works for the MetaCortex Corporation, where he sits inside a dreary cubicle squirreled inside an enormous, gleaming tower. An insomniac named "Neo" at night, he sells illegal computer programs that he deals out of his dirty, unkempt apartment. Febrile and list- less, Neo leads a blurred existence marked by boredom and monotony. Guided by a woman named Trinity, Neo is led to Morpheus, the charismatic leader of a splinter terrorist group, and learns that his whole existence is a lie: his mind inhabits a false city (falsity), and his flesh is plugged into a network of power cables sucking his electrical energy. Humankind has 52 See Jean Baudrillard, "Subjective Discourse or the Non-Functional System of Objects," in Revenge of the Crystal (London: Pluto Press, 1990), $7-38 and "Simulacra and Science Fiction," Science Fiction Studies 18, no. ?

"No one can be told what the Matrix is," Morpheus tells Neo, echoing Trinity's whispers in the dark. "You have to see it for yourself." Such was Morpheus's mantra, that the message was also a remarkably effective marketing tool. Thousands of fans obeyed, but largely failed to register the obviousness of what they were seeing. Instead, the audience followed a labyrinthine narrative to which it attributed profundity out of default, a more or less predictable byproduct of its own pronounced state of confusion. ("Do you think that's air you're breathing?") Otherwise stated, to search the storyline for an answer to Morpheus's ponderous question, "What is real?" is simply to mislead and conceal. Mediated by the pop- ulist medium which configures the debate, what passes for philosophy here operates inside the parameters of theater, as a fiction of "real" rather than reality itself. Consequently, the telling of The Matrix makes little sense, but the seeing is another story - and another, and another, piled up into ver- tiginous stacks of building technologies that literally go over the head, "resonating" precisely because the elevated vantage point collapses abstract systems of power into a concise con- figuration that gives intelligible form to the problem. From the zoomorphic bird's-eye view, the Matrix world system is rendered synonymous with an urban plan that controls space, time, and the imagination. In response, the generic, gargan- tuan City is offered up as icon, screen, and symbol. A place like nowhere on earth, the City is the legible sign of a total- izing system so large that it has become the elephant that swal- lowed the living room, a kind of ungainly ouroboros with a permanent case of indigestion. As Dietrich Neumann and others have shown, films such as The Matrix attempt to restore the cityscape as a vector of public meaning by demonstrating that the city-as-cinema is inseparable from the politics of architectural design.4 As the gridded facades rising through The Matrix reveal, the mod- ernist window functions as a barrier and projection rather than a frame of man's place in the world. Icy, smooth, and strong, tempered glass becomes the reigning metaphor for invisible social boundaries set by a pervasive capitalist system, rigorously enforced by the demands of a technological order. The interiors of MetaCortex's offices are peppered with mono- chromatic photographs of sleek architectural shafts, offering up self-referential slices that render the tower's own form as commodity fetish. An enormous ektachrome cityscape pre- sides over the manager's office, its glossy, overlarge surface 51 4. Recent publications on this general subject include Dietrich Neumann, ed., Film Architecture: Set Designs from Metropolis to Blade Runner (New York: Prestei, 1999); Mark Shiel and Tony Fitzmaurice, Cinema and the City: Film and Urban Societies in a Global Context (London: Blackwell, 2001).</page><page sequence="4">hinting that we could be looking instead through a window. When we finally glimpse the City through the taut glass, the soap dribbling down its horizontal expanse renders the vis- cous surface visible as architectural barrier. Once cleared of the obscuring film, the pane still stubbornly refuses to per- form as a Renaissance frame; behind its sparkling surface, the impressionist City remains flat and out of focus. Instead, the window is pressed into a semiotic equivalency with the movie screen: when the window-washer's squeegee wipes the soap off the glass, that squeaking motion parodies the cinematic device known as the "wipe," a simple technique rendered quaint by its age and lack of subtlety. And so the scene transitions. Frame after frame, the cursor, the monitor, and the tower are presented as scale variations on a two-dimensional theme, for these simple shapes are not registered as cubes but as screens. More precisely, it is the serialization of that square into the infinitely extensible grid - the keypad, facade, and city plan - the primary sign of institutional control, and thus the telltale trace of the Matrix. This grid is not only the primary generator of space but also the sole producer of meaning. It incarnates the Matrix, and the Matrix is everywhere. Its influence is stealthy and permanent. Embedded in the very foundations of the urban condition, the grid dictates the terms of everyday experience and is found in nearly every city scene. Its presence should be obvious, and once pointed out, it is. So why is the grid so difficult to see? In the early 20th century, the grid emerged as the victo- rious map of the modern sensibility, preoccupying several generations of avant-garde artists with its seemingly inex- haustible potential. Major modern movements, including cubism, suprematism, minimalism, and the Bauhaus, were all variations on its repetitive theme. Yet a more unlikely candidate for such attention would be hard to nominate, insofar as a grid is no more and no less than a line represent- ing a line, supported by a plane representing a plane. "Flat- tened, geometric, ordered, it is antinatural, antimimetic, antireal," wrote critic Rosalind Krauss in the 1980s. "It is what art looks like when it turns its back on nature."5 As a reductive statement of its own empirical existence, the grid represents an aesthetic autonomy achieved by virtue of its "naked materialism." The grid is synonymous with the sur- face to which it is bound and which it thereby divides, struc- tures, and represses. It incarnates the picture plane as an opaque and resistant surface, denying all forms of illusion- ism. However, the "repressive" aspects of the grid emerge 54 5.

As mathematical coor- dinates in space, the grid contains no past and lacks intrinsic boundaries, making it capable of extending both temporally and topographically into infinity. It is in recognition of that metaphysical freedom that its claim for autonomy becomes fully evident. Forever a part rather than a whole, the grid sets itself apart from history, which by its very definition requires a human presence that the grid sleekly denies. Hence, when the grid is used as a value system, we see a procrustean bed instead of a measured principle. The difference can be seen in a comparison of two illustrations of "Vitruvian man" from the Renaissance. In Leonardo's canonical version of 1490, a potent man is placed at the center of a Platonic universe where the divine (circle) and the secular (square) are reconciled through the inventive doubling of the body. Cesariano's version of 1521, however, imagines the inverse: the flesh is caught inside an expansive grid straining to escape its physical boundaries. Passive, the body is pinned down like a grotesque butterfly trapped by its own gullibility. Subjected to the implacable measure of the grid, the body is violently stretched and con- stricted, misshapen by its servitude and yet still pathetically deficient. In Leonardo's version, the divine principle in man is the generative measure of a set of geometrical ratios reflective of a harmonious whole. Cesariano renders the body prisoner to a system that only illuminates their mutual incompatibility. Though illustrating the same passage from Vitruvius's De architectura libri decern, these two images offer radically different perspectives on the human-architectural condition. From a critical perspective, however, neither version is accep- table, for they place the anthropocentric optimism of the first and the pathQs of the second into misleading opposition. Instead, consistent with the modern crisis that arises from the impossibility of fully inhabiting the world, both confirm and mourn that loss of certitude in the monolith of the sacred. In a secular era, the existence of the Supreme Architect can no longer be assumed, forcing the empirical reality of the given world into becoming an unreliable sign of His existence. In place of an ontological authority previously incarnated by the Word, there is only an endless, anxious return to a smudged and untrustworthy point of origin. As a result, the abstraction represented by the grid becomes the resolution and the sub- stitute for this vanished authority, for it too stands as a begin- ning without end, an infinite system without limits, a hermetic self-referential sign that is without time and without history. Yet as Krauss noted, the grid is simultaneously invested with a spiritual dimension, for the intersection of two lines at right 55</page><page sequence="6">angles creates a cross, the foremost symbol of sacrifice, suffer- ing, and redemption in the Christian tradition. This gives the grid the power of a myth, capable of making us "think we are dealing with materialism (or sometimes science or logic) while at the same time it provides us with a release into belief (or illusion, or fiction)."6 Religion/science, faith/logic, body/mind, become the oppositional poles of a "fully, even cheerfully schizophrenic" sign that thus becomes the emblem of an equally polarized modernity. Transformed into a modernist icon, the grid is also fla- grantly without humanity. Standing by and for itself, the grid repudiates the human frame for having been made in God's shopworn and chauvinist image; implacable, it replicates and mechanically reproduces itself through the hermaphroditic juncture of male (vertical) and female (horizontal) principles that are sternly incorporeal. The anorexic grid thus becomes the incarnation of the Universal, and as such the structure becomes symbol. As a symbol, the grid becomes vulnerable. As Colin Rowe noted in the 1950s, the vertical grid initially emerged as the pure "rationalization of business require- ments" in the commercial architecture of late-19th-century Chicago.7 Once appropriated by the architects of the Interna- tional Style, however, the structural frame became divorced from its functional charge and utilitarian context. Transformed into a declaration of political and aesthetic freedom, it became "an object of faith which is to act as a guarantee of authen- ticity," that is, the universal and self-generating grid of moder- nity. The very size of that responsibility doomed it to failure, for once the grid is exposed and the logic of capitalism laid bare, the very activity of reproduction undermines itself as a process. As Foucault argued, "Repetition betrays the weak- ness of similarity at the moment when it can no longer negate itself in the other, when it can no longer recapture itself in the other." While making the grid "modern," the principle of rep- etition was also its undoing, deflating its materialist claim to "exteriority" and exposing the myth of "origin" as unsatisfying. In sum, the sheer multiplicity of such a reductive form ultimately showed off the deficiencies that can only lead to "a sort of stuttering of the negative: the neurosis of dialec- tics."8 Its very monotony had left it susceptible to a plethora of imagistic possibilities, including a stubborn return to the body, albeit one that had been ruthlessly strained through an intellectual sieve and rendered wholly rhetorical. Unable to measure up to the grid's procrustean standards, the body hovered like the ghost limb of an amputee inside its perfect geometry. Once divested of the wobbling flesh, the skeleton 56 6.

As extensively explored by Le Corbusier in Urbanisme (1929), the crossed bars of the grid became the veritable "heart" of the anthropomorphic urban organism. When rendered synonymous with the idea of the downtown, this "place of work" determined the pulse and strength of the city's economic circulation. However, func- tional systems alone set the operational terms of the revised corporeal metaphor. As a floating projection of memory and desire, the human presence was still not required. Serendipitously, the city shot for the The Matrix is a specific combination of both commercial and contemporary cities, neatly showing the shift of the grid from functional structure to free-floating symbol as its axis tilts from hori- zontal to vertical. Its grid plan is that of late-19th-century Chicago, but its elevations are those of late-20th-century Sydney. Street maps of Chicago flutter across the Operator's computer screen as he directs runners to Lake and Wells, Franklin and Erie, State and Balbo, and Wabash and Lake, intersections all located in downtown Chicago. Crucially, we are not in Wright's Oak Park, the posh Gold Coast, or the tough South Side; these intersections are all in the Loop, the cen- tral "place of work," governed by profit, which became the historical epicenter of the famous structural frame. Arguably, the fact that the City's skyline rises from Chicago's founda- tions is less postmodern pastiche than acknowledgment of the role played by the first and second Leiter Building, the Fair Store, and the Reliance Building in the International Style's parentage. By contrast, however, the glossy grids which rise and fall like shimmering canopies could be any part of the world; the bland conformity of the International Style ensures that we localize such buildings with difficulty. The immense scale, curtain walls, mirrored facades, and opulent lobbies of Sydney's polished towers are meaningless except as opaque screens signaling an impossible state of classless luxury. The grid asserts its pervasive control in elevation and in plan, com- bining the "ruthless commercialism" of the former with the inhuman abstraction of the latter. Inside the Matrix, space becomes the pure embodiment of a calculated return: cascades of numbers become towers, towers become facades, facades become bays, bays become columns, columns become pilasters, and so on down the line into ever smaller units, reducing the meaning of existence to a numerical equivalent and gauging human worth against a work-related statistic. Exacting in its manner, the grid imposes its repetitive order on the world. On all other levels, the human referent is eliminated. 57</page><page sequence="8">No Place Smith to Neo: "You're empty" Neo to Smith: "So are you'9 There are no physical bodies inside the Matrix, only disem- bodied and deluded minds. But that dissipation is the legacy of a much older pattern inherited from a Cartesian theater of representations, the mental space wherein the divided con- sciousness views itself in operation. Hence the crucial scene in this film is the destruction of the government building lobby, the "biggest shoot-up in the movie."9 That there is something peculiar about this "technically astonishing," drawn-out segment may be inferred by the frequency with which it has been singled out by critics who disapprovingly liken it to a "video game."10 Per the creators of the film, the Government Lobby is where Neo begins to grasp his powers and behave like a Nietzschean √úbermensch . As the scene unfolds, he begins to defy the laws of gravity and discovers that he can move faster than the eye can see. He can do so because he starts to perceive the Matrix itself instead of the things desc- ribed within it. Like the painter who registers lines, planes, and negative space rather than dog, sky, or depth, Neo begins to realize that the Matrix is a representational system. As such, it requires his complicity in order for its illusionism to work, a complicity he starts to resist as he sights more and more victims. He becomes audience to their danse macabrey and as he watches them die in slow motion, he begins to real- ize that he is the unoriginal author of a shoot-em-up cliche. As a result, the "multitude of appearances" the Matrix gener- ates become increasingly unconvincing, overly simple, edging towards fake, "like a video game." Revealed as false simulacra, the guards are ultimately "reduced to nonexistence" by the revelation of underlying truths;11 as pure detritus, their unre- markable corpses simply disappear from view. Like an avant-garde artist fully claiming the military ori- gins of the term, Neo destroys in order to create. By the time he and Trinity are through, the lobby is completely wrecked and yet entirely free of dead bodies. Its heavy piers are shot to pieces and its granite walls pulverized by bullets, destroying the seamless coherency of the controlling grid by shattering its lines, its form, and its requisite anonymity. Confirming the latent anger in this scene, Neo and Trinity detonate a bomb as they leave. Entirely irrelevant except as cathartic release, the explosion devours what is left of the ruined lobby, obliterating it entirely. By this time, however, there is no one left to kill. It is modern architecture that has to die. 58 Government Lobby, destroyed. Image: Courtesy www.matrixfansite.com 9. Steve Skroce, The Art of the Matrix , ed.

As the incarnation of government, the bleak building stands as the institutional equivalent of MetaCortex software company, which likewise privileges the self-aware mind (the cortex) as the sole denominator of meaning. Both the supervisory ego and the economic system perpetuate illusions virtually indistinguishable from reality; hence they must be obliterated at the foundational level for authentic change to occur. Interestingly, the Government Lobby scene was origi- nally set on the ground floor of a chain hotel.12 Except for the change of venue, the scene remained very similar: a few policemen were to be shot, the guests cleared from the room with a warning spray of gunfire, and the lobby destroyed by a bomb. The political point is more explicit with the reassign- ment of the building's identity, but the fact that the shift could be made from hotel to government office inside this homo- topic arena speaks to the larger divorce between form and meaning as one consequence of the grid's "universality." Both Government Building and Corporate Hotel are serial structures that act as transitional spaces between public and private, combining the promiscuity of the street with the properties of surveillance. But as a place particularly characterized by the anonymity of strangers, the hotel is a temporary shelter that is not an authentic dwelling, at least not in the sense articulated by Martin Heidegger as a condition of belonging and being.1* Instead of proper dwelling, there is only a cage of representations, a classifying construct that sorts and con- sumes according to rigid binary patterns. The trap itself goes unrecognized because its fiction is complete. Hence it is the fiction itself that requires dismantling. Once the Corporate Hotel was bombed and evacuated, it would have returned us, through the folding of narrative points in space, back to the scene of humanity's original crime: the Heart O' The City Hotel, the first casualty in a chain of unsuspected explosions from previous rebellions. Here, the lifeless and abandoned shell shows us the existential crisis of a human race burned out from within and unable to recog- nize itself. Flailing in ignorance and desperation, humans "scorched the sky" to stop the enemy machines and thereby destroyed the earth, the second of human habitations. Clumsily condemning themselves in the process, human beings were banished from their bodies, the mortal vessel described in both theological and philosophical traditions as the "house" of the soul. Ironically, the illusion their exiled minds now 59 12. Skroce, The Art of the Matrix , 4}1. 1?.

It is no place on earth, and hence it is exactly like home. As Agent Smith contemptuously explains, the first ver- sion of the Matrix failed because it delivered paradise on a plate. It offered human beings an Edenic state where desire, pain, suffering, and self-awareness neither existed nor could be remembered. Made continuous with nature and one with the universe, the unconscious collectively rejected it, and "whole crops" of short-circuited humans, presumably driven to madness, expired as a result. The new Matrix proposed a world full of imperfections, and the pacified mind stopped struggling against it. Paradoxically, a perfect world was achieved through the incorporation of discontinuity and error, akin to the solution offered by Leonardo's Vitruvian man, which humanized the Idea (God) by infusing it with transient beauty. Though the surface of the Matrix is seam- less, its system is not pristine; the very existence of the Agents is proof of past and predicted lapses inside the self-directed machine. At the deeper level of operations, it is full of inter- stices and gaps, rendered visible as dark alleys, mildewing shafts, and stagnant bathrooms. As liminal boundaries that are neither visited nor acknowledged, these neglected no- places expose the limits of a particular set of cultural agree- ments. These gaps are the architectural equivalents of the overlooked gestures that, once recognized, force a crucial refo- cusing that betrays the otherwise perfect forgery;14 ignored even by the monitoring machines, these Freudian slips of space are the wrong- way routes preferred by the human resistance. However, for the millions of minds still plugged into the Matrix, the entire City is a liminal site forever sus- pended on the edge of the new millennium. Unseen and bypassed, the City cannot be forgotten because it was never memorable in the first place. Nonetheless, as extra insurance against overcurious glances, the buxom Woman in Red trolls around as a decoy, a McGuffin in a satin cocktail dress. We (men and women alike, qua Laura Mulvey) are obviously supposed to desire her, the fantasy object of the libidinal gaze bouncing inside the representation of the City-as-stage. Her Technicolor exuberance obscures the dull pavement, the bor- ing plaza, the plain walls, and the ubiquitous row of piers, for these are precisely the (sexless) structural elements that, if too closely inspected, expose the Matrix as a simulation. By the end of the film, the exposure is fully accomplished: curtain walls warp, ribbon windows shatter, granite panels tear, and the illusory apparatus comes crashing down about our protesting ears. 60 14.

Because of its architectural appropriation, the grid has become an emblem of power, but it incarnates a lesser god that has already fallen from grace. For over 50 years the precipitous rise and fall of capitalist urban space has been described and analyzed by the likes of David Harvey, Fredric Jameson, J√ºrgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault, to name some of the most prominent voices in this ongoing dialogue. One of the reasons The Matrix has become an "instant classic" is because it brings that entrenched critique before the masses. It may have fingered Baudrillard as its postmodern guru, but the philosophical question that The Matrix sustains is ultimately the centuries-old and ongoing crisis of architectural representation. The origins of this crisis are routinely traced to the Renaissance shift from mythos to logos as the organizing cosmological principle, that shift from a mythical worldview to a rationalist vision also demarcating the difference between the primitive and the modern. The increasing sense of architecture's irrelevance as a viable form of public representation stems from the ensuing discontinuity between self (nature) and skin (culture), the need to establish that boundary itself a consequence of the logos in operation. The resulting collapse of appearances as a reliable index of truth, and the subsequent modulation of "truth" into a set of historical contingencies, left the practice of architecture dangling somewhere between tracing graphs and tracking hemlines: engineering or fashion. The crisis of representation accelerated with the rise of the metropolis, a 19th-century phenomenon linked to the steady expansion of industry and the rise of capitalist econo- mies. Manifestly tied to the collective, the form of the city is necessarily connected to the problem of the public sphere, which constantly poses the issue of political relevancy. As Robert Beauregard argues, the modern practice of planning arose as a consequence of capitalist intervention. He summa- rizes the modernist planning project as such: "Reality that can be controlled and perfected is assumed. The world is viewed as malleable, and it is malleable because its internal logic can be uncovered and subsequently manipulated." The city itself liberates society from the constraints of "scarcity and greed"; under its benevolent tutelage, social problems disappear and collectivity is guaranteed. Class distinctions shall be effaced by the force of capitalist accumulation, and economic growth ensures that a formal order unifies the struggling whole. The end result will be a "'synthetic' city: 61</page><page sequence="12">that is, the city of singular form invariant over time."1* In sum, modernist planners envisioned a city that The Matrix made into The City. "The truth is," wrote Herbert Muschamp, "that archi- tecture has always functioned as a matrix, an enveloping environment that embodies a world view."16 The fact that the city of the present is also the City-as-representation is culturally consistent. However, what makes the City differ- ent from Gotham City (New York) or Tativille (Paris), to name alternative cinematic inventions, is the kind of hybrid, real/imaginary urban condition that is consistently demon- strated. As an undifferentiated, homogenous, homotopic space,17 affirming a functional distribution that assigns the same use value to everything, the City reveals itself an empty signifier. Both system and subject are hollow shells. Like the name-word-category CITY, they express a seeming order that has no specific meaning. In this, however, the City is faithful to the no-bodies it frames. Because architecture orients the body in space and defines its manner of being, it can only fail to generate meaning if the body itself no longer matters. As opposed to the convention of difference, the City is governed by a principle of similitude that casts every action into the public sphere and sees every action as equal. Gender, age, race, and ethnicity are no longer markers of social dif- ference, and thus The Matrix possesses no feminine characters. To be sure, there are female actors, but they are masculine in behavior and appearance. "I just thought . . . you were a guy," Neo confesses to Trinity when he meets her for the first time. He is embarrassed by his sexist error, but only a little, for to feel otherwise would reprimand an audience guilty of hav- ing made the same mistake. At first sight, the audience also believes that the slicked back head and biker jacket belong to a guy, until the tense loner sitting inside the unlit hotel room is pointedly identified as "a little girl" by a swaggering policeman. Provoked, Trinity rises from her glowing laptop to kill four officers as if out of righteous feminist indignation. Nonetheless, the basis of Trinity's appeal lies in her total dis- interest in "girl stuff [emphasis in original]," her icy demeanor, and her mastery of code. It is precisely because her character seems more machine than mammal that she becomes the ideal girlfriend - that is to say, a "girl" that walks like a boy.18 Short-haired, barefaced, hipless, and fiat-chested, Trinity appears to be like Neo: an alluring ephebe who wears tight pants, packs big guns, hacks the net, and kills to protect. If she defines the asexuality of a safe body free of destabilizing desire, the other female member of the Nebuchadnezzar's 62 15. Robert A.

Translucent white to Trinity's slick black, Switch represents a principle of libidinal excess held constantly in restraint. Whether leashed or eman- cipated, however, the libido is still decoupled from a natural reproductive cycle. Female bodies are not meant to bear chil- dren, and the phantasms they evoke are ultimately masturba- tory and futile. The principle of repetition is incarnated in the architec- tural uniformity of the square-shouldered, unwrinkled, blank-eyed Agents, likewise identical and opaque representa- tives of a synthetic capitalist system. All men, the architec- tonic agents duplicate themselves rather than produce new beings: inside this artificial economy, originality is not a pos- sibility. In contrast to the ovoid frames worn by humans, the rectilinear edge of the Agents' sunglasses replicates the lens of the camera, which co-opts the right angle into serving as a compositional motif. Seen through their eyes, the Matrix becomes "natural," even as the grid is uncritically confirmed as a formative condition of being. But a different sort of rep- etition is also asserted in the shocking succession of doomed (hence inauthentic) Ones that preceded Neo, who is thus not unique, not the first, and possibly not the last. Simultaneity and sequence are contrasted as models of replication, leading up to a confrontation between "pure exteriority" and "pure figure of the origin," narrated through the battle between rebellious Agent Smith and the neophyte Neo. The epony- mous Everyman meets Mr. Nobody, and each struggles to negate the absence represented by the other. Both are empty, isolated, angry, and confused: inside homotopia, they are each others' reluctant double ( +1 ) and compound ( x2 ). Their faces blank, they struggle hand to hand, up and around, down and through the City, playing out the "neurosis of dialectics" with no resolution in sight until, stuttering, the film folds back on itself, directing Neo to Room 303 in the Heart O' The City Hotel, the abandoned building where the story began. A ring- ing phone is there that wasn't there before. For Trinity, the room was a trap. Now, it offers Neo an exit. But instead of finding an escape, Neo faces his nemesis on the other side of the door. He has forgotten what Morpheus has told him about the Agents; they are the gatekeepers holding the keys to every portal. As his eyes strain to focus, Neo is shot repeatedly in the heart. He dies without comprehending how it happened. 63 19. The Matrix. Written by Larry and Andy Wachowksi.

Alternately, it introduces a fold that accomplishes the same crucial return. As Foucault noted in his discussion of Gilles Deleuze, the wrinkle is the pre- ferred metaphor, because it productively distorts the mod- ernist grid that is both the form and symbol of institutional control. "All things return on the straight and narrow, by way of a straight and labyrinthine line": pucker, pull, and twist, and the straight line collapses into aberrant folds.20 The image of the labyrinthine line also pulls us into the vis- cera left out of the mind/body dialectic, the villi, cilia, gan- glia, and capillaries of the body's overlooked microinterior. When we return to the Heart O' The City Hotel, we directly enter that bleeding body for the first time. Slumped in the dingy, constricted hallway, Neo bleeds profusely. He looks down at the luxurious blood on his hands, and its sticky gleam matches the dress worn by the Woman in Red. As it collapses, his pummeled body makes a mess. Except it is not a body, it is an image his mind projects. Somewhere under the City, deep inside the sewers, Neo's corpse is strapped to a chair inside the mother ship. On a medical monitor, we can see the unflinching flesh of his embedded heart and know that he is dead. As anatomy, however, Neo gains a whole new dimen- sion; that inert bundle of mindless muscle has become a vol- ume with a viable interior. The Matrix's parallelisms with Urbanisme thus continue, as that treatise concludes with a surprising set of anatomical drawings that could be straight from a medical textbook. The revelation of the organized anatomy provides a solution and a template for the functional city, which makes itself in the fractured image of the system- atically hollowed body. The grid of representations is now expressly Cartesian, and the obedient body stretched out before it is neatly eviscerated. Clean and final, death seems to provide the tidy resolution to Neo's neurotic existence. Lifeless, he will return to a City made in some other body's broken image, for the One who stands in for the human collective is also the One against whom the City is measured. But he is prevented from the easy solution by the unpredictable factor of emotion, which has otherwise guided no choices or played a significant role on the ship. In the name of love, he is forbidden to die; his body hears and obeys. On the medical monitor, the image of the intact heart begins to beat. When his consciousness simulta- neously revives inside the hotel, it is freed from established 64 20. Foucault, Language, Counter- Memory, Practice, 166.</page><page sequence="15">cognitive patterns. It is no longer guided by body or mind, both of which can be controlled, but by emotions that follow their own labyrinthine and idiosyncratic paths in multiple and often conflicting directions. They don't follow orders, they don't obey rules, and they don't make sense. Thomas Anderson and Neo have both expired. What lives in his place is no One. No is the only word Neo utters after he revives. He em- bodies and claims it. For in him, the will to live is a refusal to die. His subsequent existence is not an affirmation of love but a systematic exercise in denial. Because he is drawing from an emotional core that he possesses for the first time - a visceral, convoluted core that does not reinscribe itself along regulating lines - he plainly sees the hotel for its essence, not as building or Renaissance frame but a projection of institutional power sustained by the chastised bodies of others. From this point on, his job is to destroy, to challenge, to cripple, and to defeat that singular architecture of a monolithic system. He personifies the negative principle of indeterminacy inside an arena that has become politically charged for the first time. Though others may call him the One, this is not who he is; the defin- itive No precedes him. The Oracle had already dismissed him as an unfit candidate ("sorry, kid!"), and like all the other Ones before him, Neo faced down an Agent and paid for his arrogance with his life. He only lives because of a loophole. According to the Oracle, Trinity will fall in love with the One. The inexorable chain of causality thus begins: if Trinity loves Neo, and if she can only love the One, then Neo must be the One because she loves him. The One must follow the Other, and that love need not be reciprocated. Either the Oracle is fallible or is lying, or Neo is only made into the One as a result of Trinity's terms. That Neo lives because of Trinity's inter- vention tends to support this postfacto designation. It also accounts for the Agents' otherwise baffling tendency to under- estimate him, for on his own lack of merits, he was never a serious contender. Precisely because emotions cannot be ordered, the "who" could not be known in advance. Trinity might have fallen in love with Mouse, Cypher, or Switch, who would then, per the terms of the prophecy, have become the One in Neo's stead. Still bland, still flabby, still addled after his resurrection, Neo is no One; he is not Christ, Buddha, Prince Charming, or even Mr. Right. Instead, he is a congre- gation of insufficiencies, a sack of squirming impulses, a guy who oversleeps, eats slop, scratches his ass, and dresses badly. In a word, he is normal. The recognition and acceptance of his representative role - the no one who stands for everyone 65</page><page sequence="16">Leon Krier, Critique of Industrial- ization (detail). Image from Leon Krier, Houses, Palaces, Cities. in Agent Smith's stead - is the condition Trinity imposes on his survival. Through him, the political City now exists. In him, the private sphere is revived, and with it, a critical stance. These possibilities exist because Neo is not the One, that is, he is not the unique postulate providing a universal corrective to an equally totalizing system. An anomaly meeting an aberra- tion will only produce monstrosity. To expect him to be the One will only replicate the profoundly shortsighted error that produced the Matrix in the first place. In other words, it is widely agreed that the chief failure of the modernist plan- ning project was its tendency to search for holistic solutions. Guided by the optimism of an Enlightenment that had already revealed its darker side, modernist architects and planners, led by Le Corbusier, searched for a clavis universalis that would not only resolve the contradictions of the capitalist city but produce a better society. That universal key was the grid, the veritable architecture of systems, the incarnated Idea. The flaws in that radiant hypothesis were soon con- firmed by the example of Pruitt-Igoe, yet the spectacular demolition of that infamous housing project, while provok- ing extensive internal debate, affected the form and experi- ence of cities very little. In this, the housing project's demise was no different from the explosion of the Government Lobby, blown up with a magnificent bomb that left no mortal casu- alties and no distressing bodies. Like the Heart O' The City Hotel, the St. Louis apartment complex was a collective resi- dence that was an inauthentic dwelling, a temporary shelter offered to a disenfranchised social body united by their poverty. In both cases, the wrong target was attacked. Still hovering inside the capitalist system of representations, the built object was mistakenly identified as the irresponsible agent. Unper- turbed, the system emerged unscathed, for it is not the rational superstructure but the riddling infrastructure that holds the 66</page><page sequence="17">possibility of meaningful change. The problem is that infra- structure is an ineluctable pattern, a rhythm rather than a thing. No heart, no body, no purpose, and no direction can be determined on the visceral level. Hence, if the architecture of systems is to be truly dismantled, society must cease to act as spectator and become a fully vested participant, feeling rather than thinking its way through the anatomical inter- stices of the City. Newly operating from the gut level, Neo understands this for the first time. He dives into Agent Smith and shatters him from within. The Heart O' The City becomes Neo's shell: he inhales, and its pulmonary walls swell. The building's morphological responsiveness to his sensualized demands signals the begin- ning of the City's end. By entering directly into the system, he refutes the externalized stance; through Trinity's imperi- ous heart, he arrives at a resolution of the dialectic between essence and appearance. A colonist in a new world, he claims the Heart O' The City as his dwelling and declares himself to be a meaningful being. The City still continues, for it cannot be unmade by one man or one principle, no matter how com- pelling. But with the heart of the city revived and a political conscience awakened, the elements are in place for new possibilities to happen.
